<text>Courbevoie () is a commune located in the Hauts-de-Seine department of the Île-de-France region of France. It is a suburb of Paris, from the center of Paris. The centre of Courbevoie is situated from the city limits of Paris.

La Défense, a business district hosting the tallest buildings in the Paris metropolitan area, spreads over the southern part of Courbevoie (as well as parts of Puteaux, Nanterre and La Garenne-Colombes).

==Name==
The name Courbevoie comes from Latin &quot;Curva Via&quot; and means &quot;curved highway&quot;, allegedly in reference to a Roman road from Paris to Normandy that made a sharp turn to climb the hill over which Courbevoie was built.

==Administration==
Courbevoie is divided into two cantons: Canton of Courbevoie-1 and Canton of Courbevoie-2.

==History==

A wooden bridge was built crossing the Seine at Courbevoie by order of King Henry IV when in 1606 his royal coach fell into the river while being transported by ferry. Rebuilt in stone during the eighteenth century, this was replaced by a metal bridge in 1942.

The Convent of the Penitents founded in 1658 by Jean-Baptiste Forne was located in Courbevoie until the Revolution of 1789.

In 1840, the body of Napoleon was transported from Saint Helena, where he had been exiled and died, to Cherbourg. It was then transferred to the steamer &quot;la Normandie&quot; and transported to Val-de-la-Haye, where it was transferred to the small ferry &quot;la Dorade&quot; and transported to Courbevoie. It was then carried by road through the streets of Paris.

The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1858.

==Transport==
Courbevoie is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail line: Courbevoie and Bécon-les-Bruyères. Courbevoie is also served by Esplanade de La Défense station on Paris Métro Line 1, in the business district of La Défense.

There are also a large number of city buses that come through the bustling La Défense station.

When it comes to air transportation, Courbevoie can be served by Paris&#x27;s Charles de Gaulle Airport as well as Paris-Orly to the south and Beauvais Airport to the north.

<doc id="1130374" wikidata="Q23814" url="?curid=1130374" title="Stephen Merchant">
<text>Stephen James Merchant (born 24 November 1974) is an English comedian, actor, director, and writer. He was the co-writer and co-director of the British TV comedy series &quot;The Office&quot; (2001–2003), and co-writer, co-director, and co-star of both &quot;Extras&quot; (2005–2007) and &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; (2011–2013) alongside Ricky Gervais. With Gervais and Karl Pilkington, he hosted &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; in its radio, podcast, audiobook, and television formats; the radio version won a bronze Sony Award. He also provided the voice of the robotic &quot;Intelligence Dampening Sphere&quot; Wheatley in the 2011 video game &quot;Portal 2&quot;. Merchant co-developed the Sky One travel documentary series &quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot; (2010–2012) and co-created &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; (2015–2019).

Merchant has performed as a stand-up comedian, which led to him writing and starring in the HBO series &quot;Hello Ladies&quot; (2013–2014), based on his stand-up material. He starred in his first play, Richard Bean&#x27;s &quot;The Mentalists&quot;, at London&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in 2015. He wrote and directed the films &quot;Cemetery Junction&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Fighting with My Family&quot; in 2019, and starred in, co-wrote, co-produced, and co-directed the comedy crime series &quot;The Outlaws&quot; (2021–present). He also appeared as the mutant Caliban in the superhero film &quot;Logan&quot; (2017), a Nazi Gestapo leader in the comedy-drama film &quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot; (2019), and as the serial killer Stephen Port in the 2022 television drama &quot;Four Lives&quot;.

Merchant has received numerous accolades, including a Peabody Award, two Golden Globe Awards, three BAFTA Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, four British Comedy Awards, and the Rose d&#x27;Or.

==Early life and education ==

Stephen James Merchant was born in the Hanham suburb of Bristol on 24 November 1974, the son of nursery nurse Jane Elaine (née Hibbs) and plumber and builder Ronald John Merchant. He attended Hanham Secondary School and later the University of Warwick in Coventry from 1993 to 1996, where he graduated with a BA in Film and Literature with a 2:1. He worked as a film reviewer on the student radio station Radio Warwick, where he began his broadcasting career. His group there included film critic James King. A number of tapes of &quot;The Steve Show&quot; were rediscovered and have been published on various Merchant fan sites.

Merchant was inspired to get into comedy by John Cleese. In 2019, he said that he had never met Cleese, but that his parents had recently met him on a cruise and asked him to sign a book for Merchant; they also recorded a voicemail message on the phone in their cabin, which consisted of Cleese saying: &quot;Hello there, Mr and Mrs Merchant, I&#x27;d be more than happy to sign your book. I was just wondering is your Stephen Merchant the same Stephen Merchant who collaborated with Ricky Gervais on &quot;The Office&quot;? Because I&#x27;m an enormous fan and please pass on my best regards.&quot; On hearing this, Merchant said, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel I need to meet him now. That&#x27;s all I needed.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career===
Merchant began his career performing stand-up comedy at Bristol&#x27;s Comedy Box, where, he recalled: &quot;The first week I did really well. The second week I died on my arse. I realised that stand-up was not that easy after all.&quot; He also appeared as a contestant on a 1997 episode of the TV game show &quot;Blockbusters&quot; and worked for a short time as a DJ for Radio Caroline.

Merchant met Ricky Gervais for the first time in 1997 when Gervais (in the position Head of Speech at the radio station XFM London), hired Merchant as his assistant. Gervais later said that he had called Merchant for an interview because it was the first CV handed to him. Merchant and Gervais hosted a Saturday afternoon radio show together from January to August 1998, when both of them left XFM as it was bought by the Capital Radio Group. In the same year, Merchant was a finalist at &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Open Mic Awards.

Merchant worked for seven months at XFM 104.9. The Saturday show never had a large audience. Gervais said: &quot;It&#x27;s a tinpot radio station... It&#x27;s not even the biggest radio station in the building.&quot; He created the features &#x27;Hip Hop Hooray&#x27;, &#x27;Make Ricky Gervais Laugh&#x27; and &#x27;Song for the Ladies&#x27;. After leaving XFM, Merchant began a production course at the BBC. As part of his coursework, he enlisted Gervais to perform in a 30-minute short film, &quot;Seedy Boss&quot;, which became the earliest inspiration for their mock documentary &quot;The Office&quot;. They collaborated on a sitcom pilot called &quot;Golden Years&quot; featuring a manager suffering a mid-life crisis. It aired on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Lab&quot; series in September 1998, but the show failed to find further success.

===&quot;The Office&quot; and return to XFM===
In mid-2001, BBC Two aired the first series of &quot;The Office&quot;, co-written and co-directed by Merchant and Gervais and starring the latter as paper sales office manager David Brent; the show initially received low ratings. Beginning in September 2001, Merchant and Gervais returned to XFM as co-hosts of &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot;, another Saturday afternoon programme, which led to their fruitful relationship with producer Karl Pilkington.

They took a break from the radio show in mid-2002 in order to film the second series of &quot;The Office&quot;, which aired that year; in addition to writing and directing the show, Merchant made a cameo performance in the episode &quot;Charity&quot; as a friend of Gareth Keenan&#x27;s character and known by the name Oggy or Oggmonster. Merchant&#x27;s father also appeared in multiple episodes as an office handyman named Gordon. Merchant also directed a sitcom pilot called &quot;The Last Chancers&quot;, which aired on &quot;Comedy Lab&quot; in November 2002 and became a five-part series broadcast in December on E4.

Merchant and Gervais continued to host &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot; through 2003, taking another break to film &quot;The Office&quot; Christmas special, which aired that December. The radio show went off the air indefinitely in January 2004. During 2004, Merchant appeared in a recurring role as a chef on &quot;Garth Marenghi&#x27;s Darkplace&quot; and in a cameo on &quot;Green Wing&quot;, and served as a script associate on the Chris Morris and Charlie Brooker sitcom &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;. The same year, &quot;The Office&quot; aired in the U.S. to critical acclaim. It went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy which both Merchant and Gervais accepted. This was followed in 2005 by a 4th series of the radio show, consisting of six episodes.

===U.S. series of &quot;The Office&quot;===
In March 2005, the American version of &quot;The Office&quot; premiered, with Merchant and Gervais credited as executive producers. They co-wrote the third-season episode &quot;The Convict&quot;, and Merchant directed the fifth-season episode &quot;Customer Survey&quot;.

===Podcast series===
In December 2005, with sponsorship by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Merchant, Gervais, and Pilkington began recording a weekly podcast (also called &quot;The Ricky Gervais Show&quot;). Throughout its first series (through 20 February 2006), it was consistently ranked the most popular in the world, and was certified as the most-downloaded of all time by Guinness World Records. Two more series and three special installments (the &quot;Podfather Trilogy&quot;) were recorded in 2006, with the final episode released on Christmas Eve. In late 2008, they recorded four more podcasts and began a series of audiobooks examining Pilkington&#x27;s perspective on various subjects.

===&quot;Extras&quot;===
In July 2005, following a brief return of the XFM radio show (filling in for Adam and Joe), Gervais and Merchant&#x27;s new sitcom &quot;Extras&quot; premiered on BBC Two. It features Merchant in a supporting role as Darren Lamb, the incompetent agent to struggling actor Andy Millman, played by Gervais. Series 2 of &quot;Extras&quot; aired in late 2006, followed by a Christmas special in December 2007; all three installments aired on HBO in the United States. Merchant won a 2006 British Comedy Award for Best TV Actor for his performance as Lamb, and the series won a Rose d&#x27;Or for Best Sitcom in 2006 and a Golden Globe for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2008.

===&quot;The Steve Show&quot;===

In January 2007, Merchant began hosting his own radio show on BBC 6 Music, airing weekly on Sunday afternoons. Instead of comedy, &quot;The Steve Show&quot; focused on toast and music, particularly &quot;new music&quot;, defined by Merchant as &quot;music you&#x27;ve not heard before.&quot; Many of the songs on the show were suggested by listeners or co-presenters. It also featured several of his friends, including his housemate, his childhood friend, and actor Rufus Gerrard-Wright (who also appeared in an episode of &quot;Extras&quot;). A spring search for a &quot;she-J&quot; resulted in the addition of former &quot;Byker Grove&quot; actor Sammy T. Dobson joining the ensemble. &quot;The Steve Show&quot; aired for four series and concluded in May 2009.

===Stand-up===
Merchant began performing stand-up comedy in the late 1990s to critical success, though he decided to focus more on his work with writing partner Ricky Gervais after the success of &quot;The Office&quot;. He appeared in a revue, called &quot;Rubbernecker&quot;, at the Café Royal, as part of the 2001 Edinburgh Fringe, alongside Ricky Gervais, Jimmy Carr and Robin Ince.

Merchant returned to stand-up with a nationwide tour of the United Kingdom in September 2011, under the title &quot;Hello Ladies&quot;. The tour, which ended in New York, was later released on DVD. In late 2012, it continued in Australia and New Zealand. Merchant performed his first-ever stand-up tour of Scandinavia in October 2014, performing in 11 different cities as part of a European festival circuit. In an interview with Marc Maron, Merchant listed Eddie Izzard, Stewart Lee, Ross Noble and Jimmy Carr as stand-up comedians he admired and John Cleese as his main comedic influence.

===&quot;Hello Ladies&quot;===
Merchant&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Hello Ladies&quot; premiered on 29 September 2013 on HBO, in which he played Stuart Pritchard, a website designer in Los Angeles who unsuccessfully chases beautiful women. It was adapted from his stand-up show of the same name. Merchant&#x27;s frequent partner Ricky Gervais was not involved in any part of the show which was instead written by Merchant, Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. After its initial run of eight episodes, HBO did not renew the show for a second season but aired a special movie on 22 November 2014, that served as the series&#x27; last episode.

===Other work===
Merchant has played small roles in the films &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007), &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Invention of Lying&quot; (2009). He has a supporting role in the 2010 film &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot;. On television, Merchant made a cameo appearance in a non-speaking role on the sixth-season premiere of &quot;24&quot;; he also starred as a sports commentator in the unaired pilot &quot;No Skillz&quot;. In 2009, Merchant and Gervais collaborated on the film &quot;Cemetery Junction&quot;, set in working-class England in the 1970s, which received mixed reviews on release in 2010.

Later in 2010, Gervais and Merchant wrote, and had cameo roles in, &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot;, a television show starring Warwick Davis. For television, Merchant and Gervais also produced &quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot;. In 2011, Merchant lent his voice to the CGI film &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and had a role in the Farrelly brothers&#x27; comedy &quot;Hall Pass&quot;. In 2013 he starred in &quot;I Give It a Year&quot; as the best man.

On 18 October 2013, he hosted an episode of the panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and was featured in &quot;Short Poppies&quot;. In 2014 he made an appearance in &quot;Modern Family&quot;″s &quot;Las Vegas&quot; episode.

In January 2011, Merchant appeared alongside many other comedians at the &#x27;Free Fringe Benefit&#x27; at the Bloomsbury Theatre, London, in a show of stand-up to benefit the Free Fringe at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival.

Merchant is the voice of Wheatley in Valve&#x27;s 2011 video game &quot;Portal 2&quot;, a role which earned him widespread acclaim among reviewers. He has stated that while the project was &quot;exhausting&quot;, he is also &quot;very pleased by the response people have had to it. What I was really pleased by how people seemed to respond to it in the way they do with a movie they&#x27;ve enjoyed, or a TV show they&#x27;ve enjoyed.&quot; In 2013, he reprised this role as the voice of the Ap-Sap in &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, a weapon based on the Wheatley core.

Merchant has provided the voice-over since 2009 of advertisements for Barclays and Waterstones. In 2014, he starred in two commercials for Newcastle Brown Ale and for the Cadillac 2015 ATS Coupe.

He is an executive producer for the Spike show &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot; and, in July 2015, Merchant opened his first play, &quot;The Mentalists&quot; by Richard Bean, alongside Steffan Rhodri in London&#x27;s West End. He appeared in three episodes of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; as Dave Gibbs, a guy Amy dates after she breaks up with Sheldon.

He has portrayed George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on the Comedy Central series &quot;Drunk History&quot;. Through the show&#x27;s first four seasons, Merchant is the only actor to play the same historical figure (Lincoln) twice.

He hosted a special celebrity edition of the cult UK game show &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;, on Channel 4 on 16 October 2016, in aid of the network&#x27;s Stand Up to Cancer campaign in partnership with Cancer Research UK.

In 2017, Merchant played Caliban in the X-Men movie &quot;Logan&quot;. Merchant, along with John Krasinski and Allyson Seeger, are executive producers of &quot;Dream Corp, LLC&quot;, an animated series created by Daniel Stessen on Adult Swim that ran for three seasons starting in 2016.

On 31 March 2018, Merchant was a guest announcer on &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;. On Christmas Eve 2018, Merchant appeared with Asim Chaudhry in odd-couple Christmas road-trip comedy &quot;Click &amp; Collect&quot; on BBC One. Merchant also appeared as Nazi Gestapo leader Captain Deertz in director Taika Waititi&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;Jojo Rabbit&quot;.

In 2019, Merchant wrote and directed &quot;Fighting with My Family&quot;, a biographical sports comedy-drama film, based on the 2012 documentary &quot;The Wrestlers: Fighting with My Family&quot; by Max Fisher. The film depicts the career of English professional wrestler Saraya Bevis as she makes her way up WWE, and starred Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden, as well as Dwayne Johnson (who also served as a co-producer). &quot;Fighting with My Family&quot; grossed $41.5 million worldwide against a budget of $11 million.

In 2021, Merchant appeared in &quot;The Outlaws&quot;, a crime thriller comedy drama set in Bristol, which he also co-created, co-wrote, co-produced, and co-directed. A second series aired in 2022 and a third in 2024.

Merchant portrayed serial killer Stephen Port in the 2022 BBC drama &quot;Four Lives&quot;.

==Personal life==
Since December 2018 Merchant has been in a relationship with American actress Mircea Monroe. He lives in a home previously owned by Ellen DeGeneres in the Nichols Canyon area of Los Angeles. He also owns a home in London.

Standing tall with a lanky frame, Merchant once had his dance moves likened by Ricky Gervais to an &quot;upright lizard being given electroshock treatment.&quot; Gervais also described him as a &quot;stick insect with glasses&quot; and Beaker from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. Karl Pilkington described Merchant&#x27;s dancing as a &quot;bit of weird art&quot; but has since &quot;got used to him&quot;, while Russell Brand likened him to a &quot;graceful grasshopper&quot;. Merchant has said that he prefers to liken himself to footballer Peter Crouch, who is the same height, and he once impersonated Crouch in a BBC sketch broadcast as part of the pre-match build-up to England&#x27;s quarter-final game against Portugal at the 2006 World Cup.

Before the 2010 UK general election, Merchant was one of 48 celebrities who signed a letter opposing the Conservative Party&#x27;s policy on the BBC.

In December 2019, Merchant was the guest for an episode of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His book choice was &quot;Roger&#x27;s Profanisaurus&quot; by Roger Mellie from &quot;Viz&quot;, his luxury item was a piano, and his chosen record was &quot;Thunder Road&quot; by Bruce Springsteen.

<doc id="1130379" wikidata="Q3769138" url="?curid=1130379" title="Justice in eyre">
<text>In English law, the justices in eyre were the highest magistrates, and presided over the &quot;court of justice-seat&quot;, a triennial court held to punish offenders against the forest law and enquire into the state of the forest and its officers (&quot;eyre&quot;, meaning &quot;circuit&quot;, refers to the movement of the court between the different royal forests).

Technically, the two justices were referred to as &quot;citra&quot; and &quot;ultra&quot; Trent (on the same side or across the River Trent), depending on where the royal court was held at the time, but are usually referred to in absolute geographical terms &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot;. A holder was earlier usually referred to as a &quot;justice of the forest&quot; until the reign of Henry VIII, when the title of &quot;justice in eyre&quot; prevailed, except from 1311 to 1397, when they were usually styled &quot;warden of the forest&quot;. However, they were &quot;justices in eyre&quot; in the Treason Act 1351 (under which it was high treason to kill them in the execution of their office). 

Henry de Bracton says that it was the practice of the justices to retire and confer with the &quot;busones&quot; of the county. In these &quot;busones&quot; we can see the persons whose names appear in the commissions of gaol delivery, oyer, and terminer, and who were in later days, as justices of the peace, to rule the county.

With the decay of forest law and the lapse of the court of justice-seat, the post became a sinecure. The Abolition of Certain Officers of Royal Forests Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 61) abolished the posts after the decease of the current holders.

<doc id="1130380" wikidata="Q495360" url="?curid=1130380" title="Gimbap">
<text>Gimbap (; ), also romanized as kimbap, is a Korean dish made from cooked rice, vegetables, and optionally cooked seafood or meat, rolled in &quot;gim&quot;—dried sheets of seaweed—and served in bite-sized slices. The origins of gimbap are debated. Some sources suggest it originates from Japanese norimaki, introduced during Japanese colonial rule, while others argue it is a modernized version of &quot;bokssam&quot; from the Joseon era. The dish is often part of a packed meal, or &quot;dosirak&quot;, to be eaten at picnics and outdoor events, and can serve as a light lunch along with &quot;danmuji&quot; (yellow pickled radish) and kimchi. It is a popular takeaway food in South Korea and abroad and is known as a convenient food because of its portability.

==Etymology==
&quot;Gim&quot; () refers to edible seaweed in the genus &quot;Porphyra&quot; and &quot;Pyropia&quot;. &quot;Bap&quot; () broadly refers to cooked rice. The compound term &quot;gimbap&quot; is a neologism; it was not a part of the Korean language until the 20th century.

The term &quot;gimbap&quot; was used in a 1935 Korean newspaper article but at the time, the loanword &quot;norimaki&quot; was used as well. &quot;Norimaki&quot;, borrowed from the name of a similar Japanese dish, was part of the Japanese vocabulary that entered into the Korean language during Japanese occupation (1910–1945). The two words were used interchangeably until &quot;gimbap&quot; was made the universal term, as part of efforts to clear away remnants of Japanese colonialism and purify the Korean language.

==History==

The origins of gimbap are debated. One commonly accepted theory suggests that the dish is derived from the introduction of the Japanese sushi variant makizushi to Korea during the Japanese occupation of Korea. During that period, Korean cuisine adopted Western food and drink, as well as some Japanese food items such as bento (dosirak in Korean) or sushi rolled in sheets of seaweed. Since then, gimbap has become a distinct dish, often utilizing traditional Korean flavors, as well as sesame oil, instead of rice vinegar. This theory is supported by a newspaper from 1935, in which the term &quot;gimbap&quot; first appeared in Korea.

An alternative theory, suggested in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot;, published by the Academy of Korean Studies, is that the food was developed from the long-established local tradition of rolling &quot;bap&quot; (cooked rice) and &quot;banchan&quot; (side dishes) in &quot;gim&quot;. Production of &quot;gim&quot; in Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces is reported in books from the fifteenth century, such as &quot;Kyŏngsang-do chiriji&quot; (&quot;Geographic Gazetteer of Kyŏngsang Province&quot;) and &quot;Sinjŭng Tongguk yŏji sŭngnam&quot;. &quot;Yŏryang Sesigi&quot; (열양세시기), a Joseon book written in 1819 by (), refers to cooked rice and filling rolled with gim as &quot;bokssam&quot; (; transcribed using the hanja , pronounced &quot;bakjeom&quot; in Korean). 

Regardless, &quot;gimbap&quot; and &quot;makizushi&quot; now refer to distinct dishes in Japan and Korea: the former called &quot;kimupapu&quot; () in Japanese and the latter called &quot;gimchobap&quot; (; &quot;gim sushi&quot;) or &quot;norimaki&quot; () in Korean. Gimbap is usually rolled with several ingredients and is seasoned with sesame oil, while &quot;makizushi&quot; is usually rolled with one ingredient (cucumber or raw tuna) and is seasoned with rice vinegar.

==Ingredients and preparation==
&quot;Gim&quot; and &quot;bap&quot; are the two basic components of gimbap. While short-grain white rice is most commonly used, short-grain brown rice, black rice, or other grains may also serve as the filling.

Some varieties of gimbap include cheese, spicy cooked squid, kimchi, luncheon meat, pork cutlet, pepper, or spicy tuna. The &quot;gim&quot; may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In one variation, sliced pieces of gimbap may be lightly fried with an egg coating, which can allow stale gimbap to be eaten. 

Fillings vary, often with vegetarian and vegan options. Popular ingredients include &quot;danmuji&quot; (yellow pickled radish), ham, beef, imitation crab meat, egg strips, kimchi, bulgogi, spinach, carrot, burdock root, cucumber, canned tuna, or &quot;kkaennip&quot; (perilla leaves).

To make the dish, &quot;gim&quot; sheets are toasted over low heat, cooked rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil, and vegetable and meat ingredients are seasoned and stir-fried or pan-fried. The toasted &quot;gim&quot; is then laid on a &quot;gimbal&quot;—a bamboo gimbap roller—with a thin layer of cooked rice placed evenly on top. Other ingredients are placed on the rice and rolled into a cylindrical shape, typically in diameter. The rolled gimbap is then sliced into bite-sized pieces.

==Variants==

* &quot;Chungmu-gimbap&quot; () — Originating from the seaside city of Chungmu (currently Tongyeong), the dish features thinner rolls with an unseasoned surface and only rice as the filler ingredient. It is served with spicy &quot;ojingeo-muchim&quot; (squid salad) and &quot;seokbakji&quot; (radish kimchi).
* &quot;Mayak-gimbap&quot; () — A specialty of Gwangjang Market in Seoul. &quot;Mayak&quot; translates as &quot;drug&quot;, a reference to its allegedly addictive and concentrated flavour. Small gimbap filled with carrots, spinach, and &quot;danmuji&quot; (yellow pickled radish) is sprinkled with ground sesame seeds and dipped in its pairing sauce, made from soy sauce and mustard.
* &quot;Samgak-gimbap&quot; () — Literally &quot;triangle-shaped gimbap&quot;. This variety is similar to Japanese &quot;onigiri&quot; and is sold in convenience stores in South Korea. Fillings vary greatly; the expiration date is one day; it typically provides between of food energy. 
* Nude gimbap () — Unlike traditional gimbap, while the ingredients of nude gimbap go inside the gim, the rice wraps around the outside, similar to a California roll. However, unlike a California roll, nude gimbap still uses traditional gimbap ingredients.
* Yukhoe gimbap () — This variety is similar to the Japanese raw seafood &quot;makizushi&quot; but uses yukhoe—a Korean raw meat dish with pickled radish, kkaennip, and scallion.

==Restaurant franchises==
Many South Korean fast food restaurant franchises specialize in gimbap and noodles. Among the chains are Gimbap Cheonguk (), Kobongmin Gimbabin (), Chungmu Gimbab Matjuk (), Teacher Kim (), Gimbap Nara (), Gimgane (), Gobong Gimbap (), Jongro Gimbap (), Rolling Rice, Gimbap King ( King), and Charles Sutbul Gimbap ().

<doc id="1130386" wikidata="Q234743" url="?curid=1130386" title="Puteaux">
<text>Puteaux () is a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, France. It is located in the heart of the Hauts-de-Seine department, from the centre of Paris.

La Défense, Paris&#x27;s business district hosting the tallest buildings in the metropolitan area, spreads over the northern part of Puteaux and parts of the neighbouring communes Courbevoie and Nanterre. The inhabitants of Puteaux are called &quot;Putéoliens&quot; in French.

== History ==
In 1148 Abbot Suger, the chief minister of kings Louis VI and Louis VII, established a landed estate named &quot;Putiauz&quot;, which went on to become a village of the same name. Suger also founded other settlements in the area, such as Carrières-sur-Seine, Vaucresson, and Villeneuve-la-Garenne, with the aim of attracting people into the region. This was reinforced by certain privileges which Suger granted to the inhabitants.

The name &quot;Putiauz&quot; is likely to have come from the old French &quot;Putel&quot;, meaning a &quot;quagmire&quot; or &quot;swamp&quot;, making reference to the condition of the area before it was drained for agriculture. But in another explanation, the name of Puteaux comes from the Latin word &quot;puteoli&quot;, the plural of &quot;puteolus&quot;, meaning &quot;little wells&quot; or &quot;water holes&quot;. The spelling &quot;Puteaux&quot; is believed to have been first used in the sixteenth or seventeenth century.

Legend has it that Puteaux inspired the story of the gadfly by Jean de La Fontaine.

==Geography==
Located on the left bank of the river Seine, Puteaux borders Courbevoie to the north, Nanterre to the west and Suresnes to the south. In the east, Puteaux is connected to Paris by the bridge of Puteaux near Neuilly and by the bridge of Neuilly (which is also used by Paris Métro Line 1). The territory of the commune of Puteaux also includes the largest part of the Île de Puteaux, on the Seine.

===Districts===
Within Puteaux several districts can be distinguished.

The district &quot;Bas de Puteaux&quot;, located between the railway line and the Seine, is the oldest urbanized district. Notable in particular are the old church, the Théâtre des Hauts-de-Seine, the town hall and a commercial shopping mall near the rues Jaurès, Eichenberger and Chantecoq. The town hall was built in 1934 and is a typical example of the architecture of this time. The boulevard Richard Wallace is the Champs-Élysées of Puteaux.

The district &quot;Haut de Puteaux&quot;, located to the west of the railway line, is a more recent district, made of several residences and HLM (résidences des rosiers, Cartault, Marcellin Berthelot, Bernard Palissy) The Lorilleux residence, for example, was built on the site of the old ink manufacturing companies.

The district &quot;La Défense&quot; is located in the north, separated by the circular boulevard. The district, developed since the end of the 1950s, is one of the principal business districts in Europe. It mainly consists of office buildings, but some notable dwellings can be found within the district as well (Tour Défense 2000, résidence Boieldieu). Two thirds of the territory of La Défense is located within Puteaux, the remainder being divided between Courbevoie and Nanterre. Thus, the CNIT, the Arche de la Défense and the Quatre Temps shopping mall are in Puteaux.

The district &quot;Île de Puteaux&quot;, on which there are no dwellings besides some barges, shelters the sporting structures (tennis courts, football pitch, gymnasium, swimming pool) of Puteaux. A sporting complex, the &quot;Palais des sports&quot;, opened in July 2006.

==Population==

==Government and infrastructure==
The Grande Arche and Tour Sequoia, both in La Défense and in Puteaux, have the administrative offices of the Ministry of Ecological Transition. The Grande Arche also has the head offices of the French Marine Accident Investigation Office (BEAmer) and of the French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA-TT).

 in La Défense and in Puteaux at one time had the head offices of BEAmer, BEA-TT, and part of the head office of the Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea (a predecessor of the Ministry of Ecological Transition), while other parts of the ministry were at Tour Pascal A and the Grande Arche. , also in Puteaux and La Défense, once had the head office of BEA-TT, and BEAmer.

==Economy==

The tax revenue of La Défense makes Puteaux one of the richest communes of France. Puteaux receives forty million euros per year coming from the companies within the district alone. Puteaux does not have a debt and its financial reserves, placed in Treasury bills, returns ten million euros in interest alone. The budget of Puteaux can thus exceed 200 million euros (reference 2005), for only 42,000 inhabitants.

Puteaux has a long industrial past, in particular the car industry (De Dion-Bouton, but also Unic, Saurer and Daimler-Benz), aeronautics (Zodiac Group, Morane-Saulnier), the armament industry Atelier de Construction de Puteaux (APX), inks () and perfumes (Coty).

==Politics==
Charles Ceccaldi-Raynaud (Union for a Popular Movement, UMP) was the mayor of Puteaux from 1969 to 2004. In 2004 he was succeeded by his daughter Joëlle Ceccaldi-Raynaud (UMP). She was also temporarily appointed as a Member of Parliament for the 6th district of Hauts-de-Seine (Puteaux/Neuilly-sur-Seine) instead of Nicolas Sarkozy.

The administration of Puteaux by Ceccaldi-Raynaud is considered authoritarian by certain people (the opposition but sometimes also certain people of their own political camp in Hauts-de-Seine). This criticism regularly has echoes in the media (like the daily newspapers &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, the edition of Hauts-de-Seine of &quot;Le Parisien&quot; and the news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, which made a coverstory of it at the end of 2005).

In September 2005, Charles Ceccaldi-Raynaud announced his intention to become mayor again, instead of his daughter. However, his daughter refused to resign. A lot of fixing was needed, in particular in the Municipal council (reported in a dispatch of the AFP of November 21, 2005).

<text>Robert LeFevre (October 13, 1911 – May 13, 1986) was an American libertarian businessman, radio personality, and primary theorist of autarchism.

==Early life==

LeFevre was born in Gooding, Idaho, on October 13, 1911, but when he was a child LeFevre&#x27;s family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. LeFevre attended Hamline University studying English and drama. He then worked at a variety of jobs during the Great Depression, such as acting and radio announcing. For a short time, LeFevre was a Shakespearean actor.

LeFevre was a follower of the &quot;I AM&quot; movement from 1936 to 1940 or so. He and one Pearl Diehl wrote a book in 1940 of their experiences in the organization called &quot;I AM&quot; – America&#x27;s Destiny (Twin City House, St. Paul, Minnesota). LeFevre told how one day, when he was in the radio station studio, he was struck by the Great I AM presence, who spoke to him personally. LeFevre also claimed a number of supernatural experiences: driving a car while asleep for over twenty miles without an accident (this was accomplished with the help of his &quot;Higher Mental Body&quot;), leaving his physical body for a trip through the air to Mount Shasta, and seeing Jesus.

In 1940, I AM leaders Edna Ballard and her son Donald were indicted by a grand jury in Los Angeles for use of the mails to defraud. Twenty-four other I AM leaders were also named in the first indictment; a supplemental indictment named LeFevre and Diehl as being defendants. During World War II, LeFevre served as an officer in the education and orientation division of the Army Air Corps before being discharged in 1945 after spending a year in Europe and being injured in an accident. Soon after, he and his wife went on a cross-country lecture tour &quot;in a pilgrimage for world peace.&quot; Their tour was bankrolled by the Falcon Lair Foundation, a nonprofit group interested in religion, philosophy and government whose headquarters were Falcon Lair, Beverly Hills, California (the former home of actor Rudolph Valentino).

After the war, LeFevre went to California and worked in the real estate business and unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the Republican primary of 1950. He then became radio and television broadcaster becoming involved in anti-leftist causes, including work for an anti-union organization named the Wage Earners Committee. A year later the committee was sued by two movie producers, Stanley Kramer and Dore Schary, for picketing and libeling their films as being pro-Soviet. LeFevre and Ruth Dazey were among the defendants, but the case died when the Wage Earners Committee disintegrated.
A few years later he became vice-president of Merwin K. Hart&#x27;s National Economic Council; a director of the Congress of Freedom; a director of the U.S. (sometimes United States) Day Committee—whose purpose it was to diminish in importance the observation of October 23 as United Nations Day—and an adviser to Harry Everingham&#x27;s &quot;We, The People!&quot;. The U.S. Day Committee made headlines in 1954 when LeFevre led an attack on the Girl Scout Handbook as having too many references to the United Nations. The Scouts retreated, reporting that more than forty changes had been made—about half of which were due to LeFevre&#x27;s protests.

That same year LeFevre relocated to Colorado Springs and started to write editorials for R. C. Hoiles&#x27; &quot;Gazette-Telegraph&quot;. Two years later he founded the Freedom School. What animated LeFevre personally and the Freedom School ideologically—indeed, forms the bedrock upon which all courses were based—is a complicated philosophy that, in essence, rejects all modern human government.

==Freedom School==
In 1956, LeFevre founded the Freedom School, which he ran until 1973, in Larkspur, Colorado. In 1965, after a flood devastated the campus, the school and college moved to Santa Ana, California. The Freedom School was designed to educate people in LeFevre&#x27;s philosophy about the meaning of freedom and free-market economic policy. LeFevre added Rampart College, an unaccredited four-year school, in 1963. Both institutions shared the same campus, and had a press, The Pine Tree Press, which published works for both, including a newsletter for the Freedom School, the &quot;Rampart Journal of Individualist Thought&quot; (1965–68), and a tabloid for the Press itself.

After Rampart College&#x27;s closure in 1975, LeFevre carried on his work in South Carolina under the patronage of business giant Roger Milliken, and he also published &quot;Lefevre&#x27;s Journal&quot; from 1974 to 1978. In 1979, LeFevre selected Freedom School graduate Kevin Cullinane to take over the teaching of Freedom School Seminars, including the Milliken Contract. Cullinane, who taught the principles of LeFevre&#x27;s philosophy to students at Academy of the Rockies, which he had founded in 1972, taught Freedom School from 1979 until 2005 as part of Milliken&#x27;s management training. He expanded its reach to include Sherman College, Wofford College, and individual seminars from coast to coast. Cullinane then left Freedom School behind in 2000, establishing his own school, Freedom Mountain Academy, in Tennessee, which ran until 2017, when it was shut down.

Notable teachers at the Freedom School or Rampart College include Rose Wilder Lane, Milton Friedman, F.A. Harper, Frank Chodorov, Leonard Read, Gordon Tullock, G. Warren Nutter, Bruno Leoni, James J. Martin, and Ludwig von Mises.

Notable graduates include Roy Childs, Kerry Thornley, and Roger MacBride.

==Rampart Institute==
In the late 1970s, LeFevre became involved with the Rampart Institute in Santa Ana, California. Along with Lawrence Samuels and Richard Deyo, LeFevre was one of the driving forces to found the institution, presenting two speeches that were turned into booklets: &quot;Good Government: Hope or Illusion?&quot; and &quot;Does Government Protection Protect?&quot; Not long after receiving its non-profit, tax-deductible status, Rampart Institute was officially launched at The Future of Freedom Conference banquet on April 19, 1980 at Cypress College. From that event came the &quot;Liberty Book Project,&quot; which sought to edit and publish LeFevre&#x27;s 52-week audio home study-course called &quot;The Fundamentals of Liberty&quot;. The hardback book was published posthumously in 1988, two years after LeFevre&#x27;s death.

==Views==

LeFevre believed that natural law is above the law of the state and that for American society to prosper economically, free-market reforms were essential. He also believed that bestowing the good deeds of society on its government was no different from rewarding criminals for abstaining from illegal activity. All government consists of and that control our lives by stealing our property, restricting our freedom, and endangering our lives with the rationale of protecting us from ourselves.

To this end, he adopted the term Autarchism to represent the idea of ruling over your own life, being responsible for yourself, your needs, and the consequences of your choices and actions. In a speech in 1977 and published the next year in the book Good Government: Hope or Illusion?, he said:

===Pacifism===
LeFevre was also famously a pacifist, and taught his brand of libertarianism during the 1960s at the Freedom School, later Rampart College. Given his dedication to pacifism, LeFevre also spoke out against war as a product of the state. He once gave a speech called &quot;Prelude to Hell&quot; to a local Lions Club about what it would be like for a typical American city to get nuked as a result of &quot;those mighty, terrible, pointless conflicts that the modern state inevitably creates.&quot; According to Doherty, LeFevre was &quot;capable of facing down angry lieutenant colonels, who raged at his pacifistic refusal to fight for the flag, and explaining his theory of human rights so patiently, so guilelessly, that in the end the crusty colonel had to admit that LeFevre was right to stand his ground.&quot;
According to Robert Smith, LeFevre became convinced of the power of non-violent resistance after a run-in with a union. &quot;I remember him telling the story,&quot; says Smith, &quot;of union goons busting into a radio station he worked at. And he just fell flat on the ground and lay there. They were so nonplussed they walked out without beating the shit out of him. That convinced him of the principles of nonviolence.&quot;

==Southern Strategy==
After seeing the project of &quot;tuitition grants&quot; for segregation academies launched by Southern segregationists in response to the integration of public schools by the federal government, LeFevre stated that he hoped the reaction to federal involvement in desegregation would cause &quot;an aroused and embittered South&quot; to join forces with anti-New Deal Northerners in opposing federal power.

==In popular culture==
* Some such as Brian Doherty claim that LeFevre&#x27;s movement was a basis for Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s book &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and that LeFevre was the basis for the character Professor Bernardo de la Paz, organizer of the Lunar revolution.
* In the alternate history novel &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; by L. Neil Smith as part of the North American Confederacy Series in which the United States becomes a libertarian state in 1794 after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason, LeFevre served as the 23rd President of the North American Confederacy from 1960 to 1968.

<doc id="1130396" wikidata="Q7292317" url="?curid=1130396" title="Randy Meisner (1978 album)">
<text>Randy Meisner is the self-titled debut solo studio album by Randy Meisner. It was released in mid 1978, on Asylum in the United States, and in the United Kingdom. The track &quot;Bad Man&quot;, was featured in the film &quot;FM&quot;, which also included an appearance by his one-time employer Linda Ronstadt.

==Critical reception==
Retrospectively reviewing for AllMusic, critic Bruce Eder wrote of the album &quot;The songs run between the extremes of fluid, guitar-driven rockers (&quot;Bad Man,&quot; &quot;Every Other Day&quot;) and ballads draped in flowing lyricism with harmony singing (&quot;Daughter of the Sky&quot;), including major contributions from his one-time teenage bandmate Donny Ullstrom. Apart from a somewhat dullish rendition of &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me,&quot; the album works well, particularly a soulful and highly personalized rendition of &quot;Take It to the Limit.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="1130403" wikidata="Q3476539" url="?curid=1130403" title="Damascus, Oregon">
<text>Damascus ( ) is a census-designated place and former city in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. Established in 1867, it was incorporated in 2004 in an effort to enable local land use decision-making control by the community. The citizens voted to disincorporate in 2016, and, after a legal challenge, disincorporation was completed in 2020. Damascus is located east of Happy Valley and Interstate 205 and west of Boring. The population was 11,050 residents as of the 2020 census.

==History==
According to &quot;Oregon Geographic Names&quot;, Damascus can date its existence as a community back to 1867, when a post office by that name was established. That post office was closed in 1904. The original heart of the community is along Oregon Route 212, which as of 2004 served as part of the city&#x27;s southern boundary.

A 2000 decision by Metro to expand Portland&#x27;s urban growth boundary into the area prompted some citizens of the community to submit Measure 3-138, a measure on the ballot for the 2004 general election in November. The initiative&#x27;s passage resulted in the incorporation of the former unincorporated communities of Damascus and Carver into the City of Damascus, a step which prevented nearby cities from annexing the community. The city was the first new city in Oregon in 22 years.

In a special election on September 21, 2005, a city charter was approved by 88% of voters. Voters in eleven parcels of land between Damascus and Happy Valley were given the chance to vote on annexation to Damascus: six of the areas voted for annexation, four voted against, and in the eleventh no votes were cast.

As a city, Damascus went through seven city managers in eight years, and generally had a contentious existence as a municipality. This included a vote to disincorporate the city and to recall the mayor in 2013.

In the May 17, 2016 primary, the citizens of Damascus voted a second time on a proposal to disincorporate. This time, the proposal was approved, and the city ostensibly ceased to exist on July 18, 2016. However, the disincorporation was nullified by the Oregon Appellate Court on May 1, 2019. The court held that the voter turnout did not reach the State&#x27;s fifty percent threshold and therefore should have been invalidated back in 2016. On September 3, 2020, the Oregon Supreme Court reinstated the disincorporation vote of 2016 and the city no longer exists. What was once the City of Damascus is now unincorporated territory in Clackamas County.

==Geography==
Damascus sits above sea level. Located in north-central part of Clackamas County, the former city&#x27;s northern boundary was the Multnomah County line. Boring lies to the east, and Clackamas to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , of which was land and was water.

==Government==

One fire station, Fire Station 19 - Damascus, is located in the community, with emergency response also from nearby CCFD1 Station 7 - Pleasant Valley and CCFD1 Fire Station 14 - Boring. Damascus is served by the North Clackamas, Oregon Trail, Estacada, Centennial, and Gresham-Barlow school districts. The latter is the second-largest employer in the community.

<text>Beuzeville () is a commune in the north-western part of the department of Eure in the Normandy region in northern France.

Located on the Lieuvin plateau, it is adjacent to the communes of Pont-l&#x27;Évêque, Honfleur and Deauville. Beuzeville is located just off the A13 freeway close to the Pont de Normandie and the Tancarville Bridge.

==Population==
==Economy==
Beuzeville is a market town which is attracting business thanks to its strategic location and good transport links.

==Sights==
*The church of Saint Helier contains a nationally remarkable collection of 20th century stained glass windows by François Décorchemont (1880-1971), who independently invented a unique way of creating vivid colours in the mediaeval style. The style is more accessible than either the often much more abstract glass of the 20th century, or most 19th century church glass with its invariably more formal subject matter and less vibrant colours. The windows depict, among others, Saints Helier, Joan of Arc, Anselm of Canterbury, Francis of Assisi and Genevieve.

<text>Tony Rominger (born 27 March 1961) is a Swiss former professional road racing cyclist who won the Vuelta a España in 1992, 1993 and 1994 and the Giro d&#x27;Italia in 1995.

==Career==

He began cycling late, allegedly spurred by competition with his brother. Rominger&#x27;s strengths were time-trialling, climbing and recuperation.

He was a rival to Miguel Indurain in the Tour de France and was placed second in 1993 and won the mountains classification. His three wins in the Vuelta were a record at the time. In 2005, Roberto Heras broke that record but two months later tested positive for the blood-boosting drug EPO and was disqualified. Heras&#x27; win has since been reinstated.

In 1994 Rominger broke the world hour record twice in a few days. He used Bordeaux velodrome to ride 53.832 km and then 55.291 km, although a track novice.

He retired in 1997 after breaking his collarbone at that year&#x27;s Tour de France. He is the agent of Austrian racing cyclist Matthias Brändle.

==Client of Dr Ferrari==
For his attempt on the Hour Record in 1994, he was coached by Dr Michele Ferrari, who was at the trackside during the ride.

<doc id="1130447" wikidata="Q3352602" url="?curid=1130447" title="One More Song">
<text>One More Song is the second solo studio album by former Eagles bassist Randy Meisner. Released in October 1980 by Epic Records in the United States, and in the United Kingdom. The album is to date Meisner&#x27;s most successful album as a solo artist, peaking at number 50, on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

The single, &quot;Deep Inside My Heart&quot; featuring Kim Carnes, peaked at number 22 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the single &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; peaked at number 19, three months later.

==Critical reception==
Retrospectively reviewing for AllMusic, critic Mike DeGagne wrote of the album &quot;One More Song highlights Meisner&#x27;s knack for writing honest, heartfelt love songs with a countrified rock candor that reveals his rustic, down-home roots.&quot; and he added that, &quot;One More Song ends up being a pleasurable set of modest songs from a musician who was glad to be home.&quot;

<doc id="1130455" wikidata="Q5021862" url="?curid=1130455" title="Calle de la Amargura">
<text>The  (&quot;Bitterness Street&quot;) is a four-block-long street located
in San Pedro district, Montes de Oca canton, and is one of the best-known zones near San José city. &quot;La Calle&quot;, as it is often called, is very close to the University of Costa Rica (UCR) and other important higher education centers.

== Services ==
&quot;La Calle&quot; consists of small stores, nightclubs, and bars, most of which are open every day. The area is mostly known for its extensive nightlife scene.

Besides its infamous nightlife (see below) it is frequented by UCR students due to the cheap food and photocopying services.

==Name Origin==
The name &quot;Calle de la Amargura&quot; is a reference to another street of the same name located in San Lucas Island through which incoming prisoners at the dock had to traverse in order to get to the administrative building of the prison. Because the condemned knew they would not be able to escape after reaching the end of the road, an analogy was made for its counterpart in San Pedro, since this road is also long, full of distractions, and preceded the entrance to the University of Costa Rica, the final destination.

== Nightlife ==
There are many bars and discos on the main road, known for their late night operations.

== Crime ==
&quot;La Calle&quot; is often thought to be a dangerous place at night. Drug dealing is a very common activity and police officers usually come heavily armed. Petty theft and pickpocketing are very common, and visitors are advised to carry few valuables. Suggestions for visitors would be to only bring an identification card and just enough money for drinks and a ride home, to stay in a group on the main road, and to not start any type of fighting or respond to any remarks.

<text>Canada Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Kirkdale. Canada Dock consists of a main basin nearest the river wall with three branch docks and a graving dock to the east. It is connected to Brocklebank Dock to the north and Huskisson Dock to the south.

==History==
The dock was the last and biggest designed by Jesse Hartley, opening in 1859. In 1862, the Canada half-tide basin, which became Brocklebank Dock, was added by George Fosbery Lyster. Canada Dock dealt in timber being named after the main source of the trade, Canada. Fire was the greatest concern and the dock was initially kept isolated from the rest of the dock system for safety reasons. However, a fire did occur in 1893 causing £50,000 of damage. The original river entrance also presented navigational difficulties, with the area affected by silting. Modifications to the basin took place in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, creating the branch docks and graving dock.

The removal of the problematic tidal basin only took place after World War II, following a complete rebuild. Further improvements took place during the 1950s and 1960s as the dock became a base for cargo liner companies such as Harrison Line.

The dock was used as a ro-ro berth during the early 1990s.

===Railway connections===
The dock was connected to the national rail network by the Canada Dock Branch Line. The short branch line from Atlantic Junction, just west of Kirkdale railway station, into the dock was closed on 12 September 1982. The terminus was Canada Dock railway station. Although the branch line closed to passengers in 1941, it remained in use for goods. The Route Utilisation Strategy states that there should be no building on the short path of the old track in case it requires reinstating.

From 1893, passenger services were also provided by the Liverpool Overhead Railway via Canada Dock (LOR) station until 1956.

==Present==
Canada Dock remains in use, handling general bulk cargoes and as a site for scrap metal processing and storage.

<text>The Liver () is one of the zàng organs stipulated by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is a functionally defined entity and not equivalent to the anatomical organ of the same name.

==In the context of the zang-fu concept==
As a zàng organ, the Liver is considered to be yin in nature. Its associated yang fu organ is the Gallbladder. Both the Liver and Gallbladder are attributed to the Wood element and the season of spring in traditional Chinese Wuxing theory.

Regarding its stipulated functions, the Liver
*governs &quot;unclogging and deflation&quot; () primarily of qì and emotions. The free flow of qì in turn will ensure the harmonious interaction of qi, blood, digestion, and Jinye.
**the free flow of qì and xuě (blood) is particularly significant since TCM stipulates that stagnation of that flow will cause pain and illness.
**by association via its respective element each zàng and Fu organ is the origin of a certain emotion reflected in the Shen or overall spirit of the patient. The free flow of these five (and other) emotions is thus linked to the unrestrained and harmonious circulation of the qì of the zàng organs.
*&quot;stores&quot; (, ) blood
*opens into the eyes
*governs the tendons
*reflects in the nails
*Associated with the emotion of anger (, ) 
*houses the &quot;hún&quot; (, &quot;Ethereal Soul&quot;)
Its associated body fluid is tearing. 
The Liver function is regarded to be strongest between 1–3 am. Its blood is responsible for the repetitive cycles of human life, for example menstruation. The Huang Di Nei Jing describes the Liver as &quot;the general of an army&quot;. It secretes bile, which is stored in the Gallbladder. 
A properly functioning Liver organ will ensure that the tendons are properly nourished and not too tense or gristly. The normal direction of Liver qi is outwards. When it &quot;rebels&quot; it can attack the Spleen, causing nausea and poor appetite. Dysfunction of the Liver typically presents as irritability, anger, anxiety, depression, agitation, poor self esteem, headaches, dysmenorrhea, belches, a sour taste in the mouth, distension, pain under the costal arches, pain in the upper abdomen, tremors/numbness/stiffness of the limbs, blurry vision, or jaundice. Liver blood stagnation may lead to amenorrhea, blood clotting, or a bearing down sensation with menstruation.

<text>In traditional Chinese medicine the Small Intestine () is a fu organ in the Zang-fu concept.

The small intestine governs the separation of the clear from the turbid. The small intestine further digests food decomposed initially by the stomach. The clear, referring to the essence of water and grain and to the large amount of fluid, is absorbed by the spleen and distributed to the whole body. The turbid is sent downwards to the large intestine, while the useless water is infused to the bladder. The disorders of the small intestine are attributable to failure to separate the clear from the turbid dirt in the digesting process, manifesting stool and urinary disturbance, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, scanty urine, etc.

The Small intestine and its paired organ, the Heart, are associated with the element of fire and the emotions of joy or agitation.

Transporting point of SI: Urinary Bladder 27. Conception vessel – anterior midline from perineum to lower lip. This is also the Alarm point for the SI which is called &quot;Gateway to the Source&quot; (guan yuan). Governing vessel is from perineum, to spine to crown of head down to upper lip.

SI Meridian Points (S1-S10):
* SI-1 (Shao Ze/Lesser Marsh): Resuscitates, promotes lactation, opens orifices, clears Heat.
* SI-2 (Qian Gu/Front Valley): Clears Heat, activates the meridian.
* SI-3 (Hou Xi/Back Stream): Benefits the neck and back, treats malaria activates the meridian.
* SI-4 (Wan Gu/Wrist Bone): Activates and clears the meridian, resolves Damp-Heat.
* SI-5 (Yang Gu/Yang Valley): Clears Heat, clears the meridian, reduces swelling.

**the jīng weī constitutes a large part of the body&#x27;s acquired qì (the other part coming from breathing, by facilitation of the Lung zàng). In this spirit, the Spleen is also called &quot;root of the postnatal&quot; (, ) – as opposed to the congenital qì, which is stored by the Kidney zàng. The Spleen absorbs jīng weī from the food after it has been preprocessed by the Stomach and the Small Intestine, and then distributes it to the whole body, especially upwards to the Lung and Heart, where jīng weī is transformed into qì and xuě (blood). Thus, TCM also describes the Spleen as the source of &quot;production and mutual transformation&quot; (, ) of qì and xuě.
**the Spleen distributes the water extracted from the food and distributes it to the whole of the body, especially to the Lung and Kidney zàng, and thus assists the body&#x27;s water metabolism.
*&quot;contains&quot; (, ) the blood inside the vessels (this is also one of the functions of qì)
*governs muscles and limbs
*opens into the lips (and mouth)
*houses the &quot;yì&quot; (, &quot;thinking&quot;)
*governs intellect, pondering (, )
Its associated body fluid is saliva.
The Spleen&#x27;s holding function (i.e., the Spleen-qì) is said to be strongest between 9 and 11am. 
When the Spleen is functioning well, digestion will be good, the muscles will be strong and circulation will be efficient. Dysfunction of the Spleen typically presents as diarrhea, malnutrition, edema, weak/atrophic muscles, greasy taste in the mouth, or excessive bleeding and prolapse. The Spleen is especially weakened by Damp one of the Six Excesses and overthinking.

<doc id="1130484" wikidata="Q153497" url="?curid=1130484" title="Jan Czekanowski">
<text>Jan Czekanowski (October 8, 1882, Głuchów – July 20, 1965, Szczecin) was a Polish anthropologist, statistician, ethnographer, traveller, and linguist. He was one of the first persons to use quantitative methods in linguistics.

Czekanowski played an important role in saving the Polish-Lithuanian branch of the Karaite people from Holocaust extermination. In 1942, he managed to convince German &quot;race scientists&quot; that the Karaites were of Turkic origin although professing Judaism and using Hebrew as a liturgical language. This helped the Karaites escape the tragic destiny of other European Jews and the Romas.

==Life==
Czekanowski attended school in Warsaw but was transferred to Latvia, where he finished his education in 1901. He then entered a university in Zurich in 1902; there, he studied anthropology, mathematics, anatomy, and ethnography as a pupil of Swiss anthropologist Rudolf Martin, author of the popular anthropology textbook &quot;Lehrbuch der Anthropologie&quot;. In 1907 Czekanowski defended his doctoral dissertation. For his dissertation research he traveled to the Royal Museum in Berlin and to Middle Africa from 1906 to 1907. While in Africa, he led a team into the Congo to collect ethnographic materials. While working on studying the societies of Africa, he developed various statistical methods and contributed to the field of taxonomy.

The research he made in Africa has since been published in five volumes and sent in 1910, to Saint Petersburg ethnography. This colonial research was the milestone of phrenology and eugenics. He stole 800 skulls from Rwanda and took them to Europe for examination and classification. This research led to artificial racial division of Rwanda people into Tutsi, Hutu and Twa. This division was later used by the belgian colonial rule to divide people into ruling class and working class. This colonially constructed order and growing tension was the reason for the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

He then became a professor at the University of Lviv and University of Poznań. While working he introduced an innovative approach to mathematical statistics. He worked in these universities from 1913 to 1945 and in the period 1923-1924 he was a president of Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists. In addition, he worked at the University of Poznań from 1937-1946, where he researched the dynamics of evolution in human populations. He played numerous scientific roles at the University of Poznań, including vice-chairman of the Polish Social Statistic Company.

==Racial classification==
In the context of the racial theories of his time which have since been disproved by modern genetics, Czekanowski classified Europeans into four pure races. The four pure races were the Nordic, Mediterranean (Ibero-Insular), Lapponoid and Armenoid. The Lapponoid included the central and eastern Europeans along Europe longitudely as well as the Sami people of Northern Europe.

Czekanowski classified six subraces in Europe which were mixed types of the pure races. The six mixed racial subraces were: the Northwestern (Nordic and Mediterranean), the Subnordic (Nordic and Lapponoid), Alpine (Nordic and Armenoid), the Littoral (Mediterranean and Armenoid), Sublapponoid (Mediterranean and Lapponoid) and the Dinaric (Lapponoid and Armenoid). The Sublapponoid subrace (also called Pile Dwelling race) lived around the Swiss lakes.
The Greek letters which symbolise races and types could be capital or lower case.

;Pure Races
: α =Nordic race
: ε =Ibero-Insular race
: λ =Lapponoid race
: χ =Armenoid race

;Mixed Types
: ι =Northwestern mixed type
: γ =Subnordic mixed type
: ω =Alpine mixed type
: ρ or ρ =Littoral mixed type
: β =Pile Dwelling mixed type
: δ =Dinaric mixed type
==Linguistics==
Czekanowski introduced numerical taxonomy into comparative linguistics, thus founding the discipline of computational linguistics. He developed (1913) a still much-used index of similarity between two samples. He applied it to phonemes and words in text corpora of different languages. It was later introduced in analysis of ecological communities.

<doc id="1130485" wikidata="Q6140833" url="?curid=1130485" title="Kidney (Chinese medicine)">
<text>According to traditional Chinese medicine, the [[kidney]] (Chinese: 腎: &quot;shèn&quot;) refers to either of the two viscera located on the small of the back, one either side of the spine. As distinct from the Western medical anatomical formative definition of kidneys, the TCM concept is a functional and energetic way of describing a set of interrelated parts. In TCM, the kidneys are associated with Ming Men 命門, the gate of vitality. A famous Chinese doctor named Zhang Jie Bin (approximately 1563-1640) wrote &quot;there are two kidneys, (kidney yin and yang), with the Gate of Vitality between them. The kidney is the organ of water and fire, the abode of yin and yang, the sea of essence, and it determines life and death.&quot;

==TCM overview==
The kidney (Shen) is a Zang organ meaning it is a Yin organ. The other Yin, or Zang, organs are the lungs (Fei), liver (Gan), spleen (Pi), and heart (Xin). Sometimes the pericardium (Xin Bao) is included. Yin organs store, secrete, make, and transform essence, blood, spirit, Qi, and fluids. The kidneys are associated with the element water, nighttime and Winter in Wuxing theory. 

==Kidney main functions==
The main functions of the kidney are:
*storing essence (&quot;jing&quot;) and dominating human reproduction and development
*dominating the water metabolism and the reception of qi from the air (&quot;Kong Qi&quot;)
*producing marrow to fill up the brain and spinal cord.
*dominating the bones.
*manufacturing blood
*manifesting in the head hair.
*opening into the ear and dominating the two lower &quot;yin&quot; (the anus and urethra)
*dominating anterior and posterior orifices.
*housing the &quot;Zhi&quot; (will-power)
*fluid secretions are urine, semen, and vaginal fluids.

===Storing essence and dominating development and reproduction===
The kidney&#x27;s primary function is storing and controlling &#x27;essence&#x27;, or &quot;jing&quot;. &quot;Jing&quot; is the essence of &quot;qi&quot; and the basis for body matter and functional activities. There are two types of &quot;jing&quot;, congenital, prenatal jing and acquired or postnatal jing, which are stored in the kidney and known as kidney jing. Unlike qi, &quot;jing&quot; circulates in long cycles (seven years for females and eight years for males) governing developmental stages. The function of &quot;jing&quot; is to promote growth, development and reproduction, provide the basis for kidney qi, produce marrow, and provide the basis for jing, qi and shen (mind). The ancient book &quot;Huang Di Nei Jing Su Wen&quot; claimed that essence stored in the kidney was vital for human life, health and longevity.

Congenital jing comes from the parents and determines basic constitution; it cannot be altered, but it can be positively influenced by acquired jing. Acquired jing is produced from digestion of food and water by the spleen and stomach, and respiration through the air that we breath and stored and in the kidney to be used by circulating within the body. Congenital and acquired jing have a promoting/ controlling/ transformational relationship with each other, through their interaction jing is produced; all three play a part in determining growth and development, sexual maturation, reproduction, recovery and aging.

Every new jing cycle prompts a new cycle of development. For example, congenital jing exists from conception, carrying on from the jing of the parents. Once a child is born, acquired jing is responsible for replenishing congenital jing and starting the first independent jing cycle which, for the next seven years in girls and eight years in boys, will control growth and development. When the child loses its baby teeth, its body begins the pre-adolescence cycle. The next jing cycle is adolescence, when kidney jing matures and causes the ren meridian to open and flow. At this time, part of the kidney jing transforms into tian gui, which develops and maintains reproductive function. In the next stage physical growth finishes, and eventually declining jing leads to exhaustion of tian gui, thus extinguishing reproductive ability. Inevitably, decline of jing leads to old age, sickness and eventually death.

===Energy aspects===
All of the four kidney energy aspects are essential in growth and development. These four aspects include kidney jing (essence), kidney yin (water), kidney yang (fire) and kidney qi. All of the body&#x27;s functions rely on the heat provided by kidney qi and the gate of life (the space between the left and right kidneys). 

Kidney jing is the foundation of the yin and yang of all the body&#x27;s organs. Kidney yin and yang are the primordial yin and yang, and the root of yin and yang to the zang organs. Kidney yin moistens and nourishes, while kidney yang provides warmth and promotes organs and tissue. kidney yang is the dynamic force necessary to start the system of balancing water metabolism, which also employs the spleen, lung, liver and san jiao.

===Dominating water metabolism===
The kidney is considered a water element. As the body&#x27;s water gate, it regulates water metabolism and reception of qi. The foundation of yin fluid that nourishes and moistens the body is kidney yin. When the kidney receives fluid the qi of kidney yang divides it into two types, clear and turbid. Clear fluid is sent upward through the San Jiao to moisten the lung and for the lung to distribute to the body, while turbid fluid is sent downward for expulsion by the bladder. The water gate is also responsible for regulating the opening and closing of drainage ducts, namely the bladder and anus, which rely on the activity of kidney qi. Also, while lung qi controls respiration, kidney qi coordinates inhalation.

===Additional functions===
The kidney is responsible for hair luster, production of bone and brain matter, correct functioning of the ears, and regulating the opening and closing of the bladder and anus. Mentally, its responsible for long-term memory, while emotionally it is linked to when healthy determination, or willpower (zhi) and under stress fear.

<text>As distinct from the Western medical concept of urinary bladder, this concept from traditional Chinese medicine is more a way of describing a set of interrelated functions than an anatomical organ. (See Zang Fu theory)

The Bladder is a Yang (Fu) organ; its paired Yin (Zang) organ is the Kidney. Both are associated with the element of water and the emotion of fear.

As opposed to western medicine, where the bladders function is the storage and excretion of urine, the bladder in traditional Chinese medicine has extended functions, including how fluids are transformed during urine production. Fluids are still sent from the small intestine to the bladder for storage, but the bladder&#x27;s capabilities are dependent on the kidney yang. If the kidney is yang deficient, the bladder may not have the sufficient qi and heat to transform fluids properly into urine. This could result in overly clear urine that must be excreted more frequently.

<text>The lungs () is one of the zang organs described in traditional Chinese medicine. It is a functionally-defined entity and not equivalent to the anatomical organ of the same name.

==In the context of the zang-fu organs==
The Lung is a zang organ meaning it is a &quot;yin&quot; organ. Situated in the thorax, it communicates with the throat and opens into the nose. It occupies the uppermost position among the zang-fu organs, and is known as the &quot;canopy&quot; of the zang-fu organs. Due to the lung&#x27;s position in the body, toward the back of the chest and in the upper half of the abdomen, it has yin within yang qualities and is more yang than other zang organs besides the heart. Each zang organ is paired with a fu organ, the lung&#x27;s paired organ is the large intestine. Its meridians connects with the large intestine, with which makes it internally related. The lung and large intestine are connected by two meridians, Yangming large intestine meridian of hand and the Taiyin lung meridian of hand. The Lung and its paired organ are associated with the element of metal and the emotion of grief. Each of the Five Elements have a color associated with them. Due to its association with metal, the lungs are associated with the color white. The peak time for the Lungs according to the Chinese Horary body clock is from 3–5 am. Illnesses that are rooted in the lung are most commonly due to weakness of wei qi or water regulation. Common symptoms indicating lung disease are coughing, weak voice, asthma, and fish smelling mucus or saliva.

==Lung functions==
The Lung has five principle functions:
*governing qi and controlling respiration. They take in clear and expel turbid Natural Air Qi (Kong Qi)
*controlling disseminating and descending
*regulating the water passages
*controlling the skin and body hair
*opening into the nose
*housing the Po

===Dominating qi and controlling respiration===
Dominating qi has two aspects: dominating the qi of respiration and dominating the qi of the entire body. Dominating the qi of respiration means the lung is a respiratory organ through which the qi of the exterior and the qi from the interior are able to mingle. Via the lung, the body inhales clear qi from the natural environment and exhales waste qi from the interior of the body. Dominating qi of the entire body means that the function of the lung in respiration greatly influences the functional activities of the body, and is closely related to the formation of pectoral qi, which is formed from the combination of the essential qi of water and food, and the clear qi inhaled by the lung. When the lung&#x27;s function of dominating qi is normal, the passage of qi will be unobstructed and respiration will be normal and smooth. Deficiency of lung qi may lead to general fatigue, feeble speech, weak respiration, shortness of breath and excessive perspiration.

===Dominating descending and regulating the water passages===
As a general rule, the upper zang-fu organs have the function of descending, and the lower zang-fu organs the function of ascending. Since the lung is the uppermost zang organ, its qi descends to promote the circulation of qi and body fluid through the body and to conduct them downwards. Dysfunction of the lung in descending may lead to upward perversion of lung qi with symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. 

Regulating the water passages means to regulate the pathways for the circulation and excretion of water. Circulation of body fluids is a function of many organs working together as a team, including the lungs. The role of the lung in promoting and maintaining water metabolism depends on the descending function of lung qi. Under normal circumstances, the lungs are capable of sending fluids downwards to the kidneys, which pass the fluids to the bladder for excretion. Dysfunction may result in dysuria, oliguria, and oedema.

<text>Ivan Heshko () (born August 19, 1979) is a Ukrainian middle-distance track athlete who specialized in the 1500 meters. He represented Ukraine at the 2004 Summer Olympics and holds multiple Ukrainian records in athletics.

==Running career==
Heshko started to train at the age of 14. From an early age he had played football and handball, but eventually focused solely on athletics. He achieved his studies at the Teacher&#x27;s Training College: Kamenets-Podolskiy. A member of an Italian athletic club, he has been trained by Georgiy Mironiouk since 1992, and has five times been the champion of his country, including a bronze medal in 2003 at the World Championships (Paris/Saint-Denis) and silver in the 1500 m at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest.

At Athens 2004, Heshko finished fifth in 1500 m. He also competed in 800 meters, but failed to advance in the semi-finals. His personal best time of 3:30.33 (1500 m), accomplished during the 2004 meeting of Brussel, is also a Ukrainian national record.

In 2005 Heshko won the European Indoor Championships, the Summer Universiade and the World Athletics Final and finished fourth at the World Championships. He started the next year by winning the World Indoor Championships in Moscow, comfortably ahead of two Kenyan runners, completing 1500 m in 3:42.08.

In August 2006, Heshko won the silver medal at the 2006 European Championships in Athletics in Gothenburg.

<text>The large intestine () is one of the &quot;fu&quot; organs stipulated by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). As distinct from the Western medical concept of large intestine, this concept from TCM is more a way of describing a set of interrelated parts than an anatomical organ. It is a functionally defined entity and not equivalent to the anatomical organ of the same name.

==Functions==
The large intestine meridian communicates with the lung (), with which it is externally-internally related. The two paired organs are associated with the metal element () and the emotion of grief. The main function of the large intestine is to receive the waste material sent down from the small intestine, absorb its fluid content, and form the remainder into faeces to be excreted. Pathological changes of the large intestine will lead to dysfunction in this transportation function, resulting in loose stools and constipation. The large intestine&#x27;s function is said to be the strongest between 5am and 7am.

==Large intestinal disease==
Large intestinal disease (&quot;dà cháng bìng&quot;) is attributable to evils such as heat, cold, stagnation, dampness, and wind, or to vacuity. Rumbling intestines or pain around the umbilicus, constipation or diarrhea, bloody stool or tenesmus with blood and pus in the stool, and prolapse of the rectum are signs of large intestine disease. The main patterns are listed below:
*Large intestinal vacuity cold (&quot;dà cháng xü hán&quot;)
*Large intestinal humor depletion (&quot;dà cháng yè kuï&quot;)
*Large intestinal damp-heat (&quot;dà cháng shï rè&quot;)
*Large intestinal heat bind (&quot;dà cháng rè jié&quot;)
*Large intestinal cold bind (&quot;dà cháng hán jié&quot;)

<text>George Harrold Carswell (December 22, 1919 – July 13, 1992) was a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. He was also an unsuccessful nominee to the United States Supreme Court in 1970.

==Education and career==

Carswell was born in Irwinton, Wilkinson County, Georgia. He graduated from Duke University with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1941 and briefly attended the University of Georgia School of Law before joining the United States Navy at the beginning of World War II. Carswell did six months of postgraduate work at the United States Naval Academy and served in the Pacific aboard the heavy cruiser as a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve; he was discharged in 1945 (when the war ended). Carswell graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University in 1948. Griffin Bell, 72nd Attorney General of the United States, was one of Carswell&#x27;s classmates at Mercer. Carswell unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Georgia legislature in the fall of 1948. He then moved to Tallahassee, Florida, where he worked as a private attorney from 1948 to 1953. In 1953, he was appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida by President Dwight D. Eisenhower; Carswell served in this position until 1958.

===Personal life===

Carswell married his wife Virginia (née Simmons) in 1944.

==Federal judicial service==

Carswell was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 6, 1958, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida vacated by Judge Dozier A. DeVane. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 31, 1958, and received his commission on April 10, 1958. He served as Chief Judge from 1958 to 1969. His service terminated on June 27, 1969, due to his elevation to the Fifth Circuit.

Carswell was nominated by President Richard Nixon on May 12, 1969, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 82 Stat. 184. He was confirmed by the Senate on June 19, 1969, and received his commission on June 20, 1969. His service terminated on April 20, 1970, due to his resignation.

==Supreme Court nomination==

On January 19, 1970, President Nixon nominated Carswell to be an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court to replace Abe Fortas, who had resigned in May 1969. Nixon had earlier nominated Clement Haynsworth to succeed Fortas, but the nomination was rejected by the U.S. Senate.

The Senate Judiciary Committee opened hearings on the nomination eight days after Nixon made the announcement; and the president anticipated that the nomination would proceed smoothly. Before they began, however, the press uncovered a speech delivered by Carswell during his unsuccessful Georgia legislative bid in 1948 that espoused the principles of white supremacy. In the August 2, 1948 speech to the American Legion chapter at Gordon, Georgia, he said:

When the story broke, Carswell said &quot;specifically and categorically, I renounce and reject the words themselves and the thought they represent; they are abhorrent.&quot; The NAACP, upon learning of Carswell&#x27;s racist comments, declared their opposition to Carswell&#x27;s nomination and asked that his appointment be rejected by the Senate. U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell, citing an extensive background check by the Justice Department, was willing to forgive, stating that it was unfair to criticize Carswell for &quot;political remarks made 22 years ago&quot;.

Other issues regarding Carswell&#x27;s civil rights record soon also came to light, such as his being involved in turning a public golf course into a segregated private club in Tallahassee, Florida, signing a deed to property which contained a racially restrictive covenant and prolonging the duration of a school desegregation case from 1963 to 1967.

Meanwhile, feminists accused him of being an opponent of women&#x27;s rights. Various women, including U.S. Congresswoman Patsy Mink and Betty Friedan, testified before the Senate, opposed his nomination. They described a case in which Judge Carswell refused a rehearing for a complainant who was the mother of preschool children.

During the hearings concerns about Carswell&#x27;s mediocre skill as a jurist were raised as well. By one assessment, it was reported, 40 percent of his rulings had been overturned on appeal. Louis H. Pollak, then dean of Yale Law School, testified that: &quot;There is nothing in these opinions that suggests more than at very best a level of modest competence, no more than that.&quot; Senator George McGovern of South Dakota said of Carswell, &quot;I find his record to be distinguished largely by two qualities: racism and mediocrity.&quot; In response, Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska suggested that critics were focusing on Carswell&#x27;s scholarship because they didn&#x27;t like that he was a Southerner. Later, Hruska famously told reporters:

The remark was criticized by many as being anti-semitic, which further damaged Carswell&#x27;s cause.

Despite the testimony given about his civil rights record, on February 16, 1970, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–4 to forward the nomination to the full Senate with a favorable recommendation. After opponents of Carswell failed, by a 44–52 vote, to return the nomination to the Judiciary committee for further review on April 6, the Senate rejected Carswell&#x27;s nomination on April 8, 1970, by a 45–51 vote, with 13 Republicans joining 38 Democrats in voting &quot;no&quot;.

Not since Grover Cleveland, in 1893–94, had the Senate rejected two of the president&#x27;s Supreme Court nominees. President Nixon accused Democrats of having an anti-Southern bias as a result saying, &quot;... the real reason for their rejection was their legal philosophy, a philosophy that I share, of strict construction of the Constitution, and also the accident of their birth, the fact that they were born in the South ... I understand the bitter feelings of millions of Americans who live in the South about the act of regional discrimination that took place in the Senate yesterday.&quot; Later that April, the president nominated Harry Blackmun to fill the Fortas vacancy. He was later confirmed in a 94–0 vote on May 12.

==U.S. Senate campaign==
On April 20, 1970, Carswell resigned from his judicial position to run for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate from Florida. His opponent was U.S. Representative William C. Cramer of St. Petersburg. Expecting to benefit politically in Florida from the rejection of Judge Carswell to the Supreme Court, aides of either Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr., or U.S. Senator Edward Gurney of Winter Park urged Carswell to resign from the bench to run for the Senate seat being vacated by the long-term Democrat Spessard Holland. Cramer claimed that Gurney had in a 1968 gentlemen&#x27;s agreement agreed to support him for the seat. Gurney declined to discuss the gentlemen&#x27;s agreement with Cramer but said that he and Cramer, who had been House colleagues, had &quot;totally different opinions on this. That is ancient history, and I see no point in reviving things. … If I told my complete version of the matter, Cramer would not believe me, and I don&#x27;t want Bill angry at me.&quot; Gurney claimed that he was unaware that Cramer had considered running for the Senate in 1968 and had deferred that year to Gurney, with the expectation that Cramer would seek the other Senate seat in 1970 with Gurney&#x27;s backing.

When Kirk and Gurney endorsed Carswell, Lieutenant Governor Ray C. Osborne, a Kirk appointee, abandoned his own primary challenge to Cramer. Years later, Kirk said that he &quot;should have stuck with Osborne&quot;, later an attorney from Boca Raton, and not encouraged Carswell to run. Kirk also said that he had not &quot;created&quot; Carswell&#x27;s candidacy, as the media had depicted.

Carswell said that he ran for the Senate because he wanted to &quot;confront the liberals who shot me down&quot; but denied that Kirk took advantage of the failed confirmation to thwart Cramer. &quot;... Neither then nor now did I feel used. ... What feud they had was their own.&quot; Carswell said that he had no knowledge of a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between Gurney and Cramer and had considered running for the Senate even before he was nominated to the Supreme Court.

Carswell instead blamed his loss on the &quot;dark evil winds of liberalism&quot; and the &quot;northern press and its knee-jerking followers in the Senate&quot;.

Carswell reported that U.S. Representative Rogers Clark Ballard Morton of Maryland, who was also in 1970 the Republican national chairman, had told him that he believed Carswell was &quot;clearly electable&quot; and that Cramer should not risk the loss of a House seat that had been in Republican hands since 1955. Cramer, however, claimed that Morton had termed the intraparty machinations against Cramer the worst &quot;double crosses&quot; that Morton had ever witnessed in the party. President Nixon sat out the Carswell-Cramer primary even though in 1969 he had strongly urged Cramer to enter the race. Deputy Press Secretary Gerald Lee Warren said that Nixon had &quot;no knowledge and no involvement&quot; in Carswell&#x27;s candidacy.

Gurney claimed that Harry S. Dent, Sr., a South Carolina political consultant with ties to Republican U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, had urged Carswell to run. Carswell further secured endorsements from actors John Wayne and Gene Autry and retained Richard Viguerie, the direct mail specialist from Falls Church, Virginia, to raise funds.

Cramer defeated Carswell, 220,553 to 121,281. A third contender, businessman George Balmer, received the remaining 10,947 votes. Thereafter, Cramer was defeated, 54%–46%, by the Democrat Lawton Chiles of Lakeland in a Democratic year.

Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, who opposed Carswell&#x27;s confirmation to the Supreme Court, said that Carswell &quot;was asking for it, and he got what he deserved&quot;.

==Later years==
In 1976, Carswell pled guilty to battery for advances he made to an undercover police officer in a Tallahassee men&#x27;s room. Then, in September 1979, Carswell was attacked and beaten by a man whom he had invited to his Atlanta, Georgia, hotel room in similar circumstances. Until these incidents there had been no public talk of Carswell&#x27;s sexuality.

Carswell subsequently returned to his private law practice before retiring. He died in 1992 of lung cancer; his wife, Virginia, died in 2009.

<doc id="1130529" wikidata="Q1247810" url="?curid=1130529" title="Panorama (British TV programme)">
<text>Panorama is a British current affairs documentary programme broadcast on the BBC. First broadcast in 1953, it is the world&#x27;s longest-running television news magazine programme.

&quot;Panorama&quot; has been presented by many well-known BBC presenters, including Richard Dimbleby, Robin Day, David Dimbleby and Jeremy Vine. , it broadcasts in peak time on BBC One, without a regular presenter. The programme also airs worldwide through the international feed of the BBC News channel in many countries, and domestically via the UK feed.

==History==
&quot;Panorama&quot; was launched on 11 November 1953 by the BBC; it emphasises investigative journalism. &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reporter Pat Murphy was the original presenter, who only lasted one episode after accidentally broadcasting a technical mishap. Max Robertson then took over for a year. The programme originally had a magazine format and included art features.

In September 1955, when Richard Dimbleby took over as presenter, it got the subtitle Window on the World. He presented the show until his death in 1965.

His son, David Dimbleby, later presented the programme on 11 November 1974—the 21st anniversary of the show. Other past presenters include: Sir Robin Day, Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Sir Charles Wheeler and Jeremy Vine. On 13 December 2010, it was announced that the programme would be relaunched during the new year with no regular presenter.

===International versions===
&quot;Panorama&quot; set an example for the German magazine series of the same name, which is produced by Norddeutscher Rundfunk, and broadcast by Das Erste. &quot;Panorama&quot; started there in 1961 and is one of the leading political magazine shows.

===Theme music===
The original theme music was an excerpt from &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; by Sibelius, which was followed a few years later by a composition by Robert Farnon entitled &quot;Openings &amp; Endings&quot;. From 1968, an extract from Rachmaninov&#x27;s Symphony No.1 in D Minor, 4th Movement was used, followed in 1971 by an adaptation of Francis Lai&#x27;s (&quot;Today It&#x27;s You&quot;). The latest version was arranged in 2023 by Bojan Andic.

==Notable programmes==

===Mescaline===
In 1955, &quot;Panorama&quot; filmed Christopher Mayhew taking mescaline under medical supervision. The resulting programme was never broadcast, though the footage and transcripts were later released.

===Spaghetti tree===
&quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast a famous hoax film about the harvesting of the spaghetti crop on April Fool&#x27;s Day, 1957.

===Salvador Dalí===
Broadcast on 4 May 1955, Malcolm Muggeridge talked with Salvador Dalí, the Spanish surrealist artist.

===Maggie&#x27;s Militant Tendency===
In January 1984, &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast an episode which claimed that three Conservative MPs (Neil Hamilton, Harvey Proctor and Gerald Howarth) had links to far-right organisations both in Britain and on the Continent.

The programme was based on an internal Conservative Party report compiled by Phil Pedley, Chairman of the Young Conservatives. &quot;Panorama&quot; confirmed its status with a senior Conservative Party vice chairman. The report was formally presented to the Party in the week before the programme was aired. During the making of the programme, attempts to contact some of the named MPs for comment were unsuccessful. (Hamilton&#x27;s wife Christine later described how &quot;Neil and I had devised a method for making sure that Panorama personnel would not be in a position to say that Neil had refused to speak&quot;.) The programme was vetted prior to transmission by the BBC&#x27;s lawyers, by the Head of Currents Affairs Television, and by the Chief Assistant to the Director General, Margaret Douglas.

Two of the MPs named in the programme (Hamilton and Howarth) sued the BBC and the programme-makers. The Director-General, Alasdair Milne, reviewed the BBC&#x27;s own legal advice, and that of his Chief Assistant, and declared the programme to be &quot;rock solid&quot;. The Board of Governors (Chairman Stuart Young) also gave their backing for the programme to be defended in court. Stuart Young died in August 1986, two months before the libel case against Panorama came to trial. A new chairman, Marmaduke Hussey, had been appointed but had not formally arrived at the BBC when the trial opened on 13 October 1986. Hussey nevertheless spoke with the BBC&#x27;s barrister, Charles Grey. Hussey says in his memoirs that &quot;Grey thought it unlikely the BBC would win&quot;. Sir Charles Grey disputes this statement, saying that &quot;my junior and I both thought the case was winnable&quot;. 
The first four days of the trial were given over to opening statements from Hamilton and Howarth and their lawyers, which received wide press coverage. On the evening of the fourth day the BBC&#x27;s Assistant DG Alan Protheroe informed the BBC&#x27;s legal team and the named defendants that the Governors now wished to settle the case immediately. This prevented the BBC&#x27;s defence from being put to the court, or known to the public.

Hamilton and Howarth were each awarded £25,000 in damages. Costs amounted to £240,000. They dropped their case against Phil Pedley.

There was controversy over the editing of the programme: it juxtaposed shots of Howarth wearing a train driver&#x27;s uniform at a steam railway enthusiasts&#x27; rally with the claim that he had attended a fascist meeting in Italy, suggesting that the uniform he was wearing was a fascist one.

===Diana, Princess of Wales interview===

Arguably the best-known &quot;Panorama&quot; programme is the 1995 interview of Diana, Princess of Wales by Martin Bashir. Conducted after Diana&#x27;s separation from Charles, Prince of Wales, the interview openly discussed the rumours about her personal life. Its filming and planning was subject to extreme secrecy, with Richard James Ayre, the Controller of Editorial Policy, authorising a series of clandestine meetings between Bashir and Diana.

A quarter-century later, it was revealed that Bashir had used journalistically unethical practices in gaining the interview. In late 2020, the BBC director general Tim Davie apologised to Earl Spencer, Diana&#x27;s brother, for the use of highly dubious methods. The Earl, who had introduced Diana and Bashir, rejected the apology and demanded an inquiry. Former Justice of the Supreme Court John Dyson, Lord Dyson conducted an independent inquiry into the issue. Dyson&#x27;s inquiry found Bashir guilty of deceit and breaching BBC editorial conduct to obtain the interview.

===Omagh bombing===
One of the most controversial broadcasts of recent time was the &quot;Who bombed Omagh?&quot; programme, which named those suspected of involvement in the Omagh bombing. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry of Scotland Yard&#x27;s anti-terrorist unit SO13 said that the Real IRA attack on the BBC Television Centre could have been a revenge attack for the broadcast.

===Scientology===
In 1987, the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme &quot;Scientology: The Road to Total Freedom?&quot; for the first time exposed on broadcast television the secret upper-level doctrines of the Church of Scientology, and featured an animated retelling of the Xenu incident of Scientology doctrine.

On 14 May 2007, an episode titled &quot;Scientology and Me&quot; was broadcast. The journalist John Sweeney presented the edition, showing how the Church reacted to his journalistic investigations, including its reaction when he stated to members that some people describe the organisation as a &quot;cult&quot;. At one point during an interview, the presenter lost his temper with the Church&#x27;s international spokesman; an edited portion of this incident was released subsequently by the Church on YouTube and DVD in an attempt to publicise it and raise controversy. However, the 2007 Scientology episode was &quot;Panorama&quot;&#x27;s greatest audience since it moved to Monday evening.

A follow-up programme, &quot;The Secrets of Scientology&quot;, was broadcast on 28 September 2010, presenting proof that the Church had harassed Sweeney during the making of the earlier documentary, with the specific intention of making him react in the way he eventually did. The episode also included numerous interviews with former high-ranking members of the organisation who had been subject to harassment.

===&quot;Panorama&quot; and Seroxat===
Since 2002, &quot;Panorama&quot; has made four programmes about the anti-depressant Seroxat (paroxetine / Paxil):
&quot;The Secrets of Seroxat&quot; (2002); &quot;Seroxat: Emails from the Edge&quot; (2003); &quot;Taken on Trust&quot; (2004) and &quot;Secrets of the Drug Trials&quot; (2007).

&quot;The Secrets of Seroxat&quot; elicited a record response from the public as 65,000 people telephoned the BBC helpline and 1,300 people emailed &quot;Panorama&quot; directly.

The major mental health charity Mind collaborated with &quot;Panorama&quot; in a survey of those who emailed the programme. Anonymous findings from the 239 responses were sent to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

The second &quot;Panorama&quot; programme on Seroxat, &quot;Emails from the Edge&quot;, included a report of the survey to which the 239 people responded. It showed widespread experiences of suicidal feelings and other severe reactions, very bad withdrawal symptoms and lack of warnings from doctors. After the broadcast users/survivors and Mind protested outside the offices of the MHRA.

On 29 January 2007, the fourth documentary of the series about the drug Seroxat was broadcast. It focused on three GlaxoSmithKline paediatric clinical trials on depressed children and adolescents. Data from the trials show that Seroxat could not be proven to work for teenagers. Not only that, one clinical trial indicated that they were six times more likely to become suicidal after taking it. In the programme, &quot;Panorama&quot; revealed the secret trail of internal emails which show how GlaxoSmithKline manipulated the results of the trials for its own commercial gain. Access to the documents has been gained as GlaxoSmithKline fights a fraud trial in the US.

Some of these previously secret Glaxo documents featured in the programme were leaked into the internet after the programme&#x27;s broadcast.

===Undercover: Football&#x27;s Dirty Secrets===

On 19 September 2006 &quot;Panorama&quot; showed a documentary called &quot;Undercover: Football&#x27;s Dirty Secrets&quot;, which alleged payments in English football contrary to the rules of the Football Association, involving:

* That Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce, and his agent son Craig were implicated for taking &quot;bungs&quot; (a bribe or kickback) from agents for signing certain players. Two agents, Teni Yerima and Peter Harrison, were secretly filmed, each claiming separately that they had paid Allardyce through his son. Allardyce denies ever taking, or asking for, a bung. The programme was aired on the same night that Bolton beat Walsall 3–1 in the Carling Cup, so Allardyce missed the original showing.
* Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp is secretly filmed discussing the possibility of buying the Blackburn Rovers captain Andy Todd with agent Peter Harrison, which is against Football Association rules.
* Then Portsmouth first-team coach Kevin Bond, who was first team coach of Newcastle United at the time of broadcast, is secretly recorded admitting he would consider discussing receiving payments from a proposed new agency involving agent Peter Harrison. Consequently, Bond was relieved of his duties at Newcastle.
* Chelsea director of youth football Frank Arnesen is secretly filmed making an illegal approach or &quot;tapping up&quot; Middlesbrough&#x27;s England youth star 15-year-old Nathan Porritt. Arnesen offers a fee of £150,000 spread over three years as an incentive to relocate. Both of these allegations are against FA rules.
* Agent Peter Harrison told the undercover reporter that, to secure transfer deals with Bolton, he bribed Sam Allardyce by offering to pay his son Craig. Harrison is a FIFA-listed agent who is based in the north-east of England.
* That three different Bolton transfer signings involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce, some when he was contractually banned from doing any Bolton deals. &quot;Panorama&quot; alleged Bolton&#x27;s transfer signings of defender Tal Ben Haim, midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata and goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi involved secret payments from agents to Craig Allardyce. Allardyce&#x27;s son quit the agency business in summer 2006, and has admitted in newspaper interviews that his working as an agent might have cost his father the chance of becoming England manager.

The Football Association has asked for any evidence as it tries to rid such action from football.

===Sex Crimes and the Vatican===
On 1 October 2006 &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast an episode on Crimen Sollicitationis, a church &quot;instruction&quot; approved by Pope John XXIII in 1962, which establishes a procedure for dealing with child sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church. It was enforced for 20 years by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger before he became the Pope. It instructs bishops on how to deal with allegations of child abuse against priests. Critics claim the document has been used to evade prosecution for sex crimes.

===Daylight Robbery===
&quot;Panorama&quot; investigated claims that as much as $23 billion (£11.75 billion) may have been lost, stolen or not properly accounted for in Iraq.

The United States Department of Justice has imposed gagging orders that prevent discussion of the allegations. US and other media have reported little on this issue.

===Death in the Med===
In a programme broadcast in 2010, Jane Corbin investigated what really happened on the ship &quot;MV Mavi Marmara&quot;, when Israeli commandos seized the ship as part of the blockade of Gaza.

Abbas Al Lawati, a reporter for &quot;Gulf News&quot;, who was on the &quot;Mavi Marmara&quot; during the Gaza flotilla raid, criticised &quot;Panorama&quot;&#x27;s reporting of the raid in the documentary, &quot;Death in the Med&quot;, stating that it was either a result of &quot;weak journalism&quot; or &quot;deep bias&quot;. Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire, who had also participated in the Free Gaza flotilla, has also accused the programme of a &quot;lack of truth&quot; and &quot;bias&quot; in a letter to the BBC, describing its effects on the families of those who died as a &quot;grave injustice&quot;.

&quot;The BBC Trust has ruled that a &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary about the Israeli boarding of the Mavi Marmara was &quot;accurate and impartial&quot; overall...&quot;

=== FIFA&#x27;s Dirty Secrets ===

On 29 November 2010, three days before voting for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast an investigation into bribes by senior FIFA officials.

===Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed===

On 31 May 2011 &quot;Panorama&quot; aired an investigation into physical and psychological abuse suffered by people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour at Winterbourne View private hospital in Bristol. It showed a number of patients being repeatedly punched, kicked, slapped, pinned down and given cold punishment showers – then left outside in near-zero degree temperatures.

Local social services and the national regulator had received various warnings but the mistreatment continued. One senior nurse three times contacted the national regulator saying he wanted to talk about &quot;abuse&quot; – but heard nothing back. The hospital was shut down.

On 21 June 2011, 86 people and organisations wrote to the Prime Minister, David Cameron about the revelations, &quot;We are aware of the various actions currently being taken within and outside government – such as the DH review and CQC internal enquiry. We hope to make submissions to those both individually and collectively. However, on their own these will not be enough and a clear programme is needed to achieve change.&quot;

The prime minister responded saying he was &quot;appalled&quot; at the &quot;catalogue of abuses&quot; &quot;Panorama&quot; had revealed.

In June 2011 the Association of Supported Living[30] issued a press statement, which was followed up in writing to every member of parliament in the United Kingdom, calling for community-based assisted living services to replace institutional services for people with learning disabilities.

The national regulator, the CQC did a nationwide check on facilities owned by the same company – as a result, three more institutions have been closed.

The CQC also inspected 132 similar institutions and a Serious Case Review was commissioned – some of the roughly ten local and national enquiries were carried out to examine what went wrong, including one by NHS Southwest which was one of the first to be published and list many of the others.

The head of the Care Quality Commission resigned ahead of a critical government report, a report in which Winterbourne View was cited.

Eleven people plead guilty to criminal offences of neglect or abuse as a result of evidence from Undercover Care and six of them were jailed. Immediately after the eleventh person pleaded guilty, the Serious Case Review was published, revealing hundreds of previous incidents at the hospital and missed warnings.

Mencap published a report warning that similar abuse could be going on elsewhere and calling for the closure of all large institutions far from people&#x27;s families.

The film has also won a number of awards including the RTS Scoop of the year and a BAFTA.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said, &quot;It is impossible to read the details of what went on at Winterbourne View, a care home for the severely disabled in Gloucestershire, without feeling repelled. In the wake of an exposé from the BBC’s Panorama, 11 members of staff were convicted of almost 40 charges of neglect and ill-treatment of those in their care.&quot;

===Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate===

On 28 May 2012 &quot;Panorama&quot; examined the issues of racism, antisemitism and football hooliganism which it stated were prevalent among Polish and Ukrainian fans. The programme, titled &quot;Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate&quot;, included recent footage of fans chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners. The documentary recorded antisemitism and monkey noise taunts of black players in Poland. In Ukraine, the documentary recorded Nazi salutes and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans violently assaulting a group of Asian students at the Metalist Oblast Sports Complex, one of the stadiums hosting matches in Ukraine. &quot;Panorama&quot; filmed former England defender Sol Campbell watching these clips, and then asked him whether he would recommend families go to the Championship. He responded: &quot;Stay at home, watch it on TV. Don&#x27;t even risk it… because you could end up coming back in a coffin.&quot;

The report was then followed up by most of the British media, which published a large number of articles accusing Poles and Ukrainians of racism.

The documentary was criticised as sensationalist, unbalanced and unethical. Jonathan Ornstein, Director of the Jewish Community Center in Kraków, Poland, and who was interviewed for the film said: &quot;I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source. The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda... the BBC knowingly cheated its own audience – the British people – by concocting a false horror story about Poland. In doing so, the BBC has spread fear, ignorance, prejudice and hatred. I am profoundly disturbed by this unethical form of journalism.&quot; The BBC rejected Ornstein&#x27;s criticism, however, saying: &quot;The context of the programme was made clear to Mr Ornstein both before and during the interview which he kindly agreed to do with the programme makers. &quot;Panorama&quot; disagrees in the strongest terms that his interview was misrepresented.&quot; The BBC reproduced the text of Ornstein&#x27;s interview, including those parts which were not broadcast, and also pointed out that Ornstein &quot;contacted the programme makers two days after it was broadcast in the UK on 28 May and immediately thereafter running on YouTube. He made none of the comments featured in his statement of Wednesday 6 June. We note that his statement was made following the programme&#x27;s broadcast on Tuesday 5th June on Polish TV.&quot;

Another source used in the film, anti-racism campaigner Jacek Purski said: &quot;The material prepared by the BBC is one-sided. It does not show the whole story of Polish preparations for the Euros. It does not show the Championship ran a lot of activities aimed at combating racism in the &quot;Respect Diversity&quot; campaign. For us the Euro is not only about matches. The event has become an opportunity to fight effectively against racism and promote multiculturalism. There is no country in Europe free from racism. These are the facts.&quot;

Black Polish MP John Godson said: &quot;The documentary was biased, one-sided and rather sensational. I have received information that there were also interviews that were omitted by the BBC—for example, interview with the Polish police.&quot;

A reporter from &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;, Poland&#x27;s most popular left-wing newspaper, questioned &quot;Panorama&quot;&#x27;s practices and said: &quot;I am becoming more and more surprised with what the BBC says. So far it has denied two situations I witnessed. I would not be surprised if the BBC prepared a statement saying that the &quot;Panorama&quot; crew has never been to Poland.&quot;

Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleh Voloshyn responded that the allegations were an &quot;invented and mythical problem&quot;, and that &quot;Nazi symbols can be seen at ... any match in England&quot;. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated: &quot;Nobody who comes to Poland will be in any danger because of his race. This is not our custom, as is not pointing out similar incidents in other countries.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported: &quot;Other sources have come forward to say that an interview with a Jewish Israeli player was also cut from the programme because he failed to confirm &quot;Panorama&quot;&#x27;s &quot;anti-semitism&quot; thesis. The BBC interviewed midfielder Aviram Baruchian, who plays for the Polish team Polonia Warsaw. One source who was present said the &quot;Panorama&quot; journalists had complained afterwards that the interview was &quot;useless&quot;. &quot;Panorama&quot; strongly denies this. It says the interview was not used because Baruchian had only played in the Polish league since January.

&quot;Panorama&quot; responded to the criticism, saying:

British columnist Edward Lucas wrote: &quot;Either the allegations against the BBC are a tissue of lies (and those who make them will be exposed), or the programme-makers have a lot of explaining to do. ...it rightly decried the use of &quot;Jew&quot; as an insult, but never mentioned that just the same – deplorable – language is used by rival fans against Ajax in the Netherlands or Tottenham Hotspur in Britain. It said ethnic minorities were &quot;all but invisible&quot; – but did not mention that Poland has two black members of parliament (Britain elected its first only in 1987). Poland certainly has its problems – but the highly questionable assumptions behind eastern &#x27;backwardness&#x27; and Western &#x27;progress&#x27; went blithely unexamined.

&quot;It would be easy to scent a kind of &#x27;orientalism&#x27; here: the belief that &#x27;ex-communist&#x27; is synonymous with &#x27;poor&#x27;, &#x27;nasty&#x27; and &#x27;ignorant&#x27;. The muddy wastelands of the east are great places to make shocking documentaries. Best of all, because nobody there knows English, you can say pretty much what you like and get away with it. Not any more.&quot;

Brendan O&#x27;Neill wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that England fans had staged &quot;a protest against BBC &quot;Panorama&quot;&#x27;s hysterical depiction of Ukraine as a hotbed of racism and anti-Semitism, which they have discovered during their stay in that country to be untrue. ...it was the respectable Beeb, echoed by broadsheets, which painted an entire nation &quot;over there&quot; as backward and prejudiced, while it has fallen to everyday fans to poke holes in this xenophobic mythmaking and to point out that there is actually nothing scary about modern Ukraine and its inhabitants. England fans have proven themselves way more racially enlightened than the aloof suits in the current-affairs department of the BBC.&quot;

England football coach Roy Hodgson said the racism allegations were &quot;the biggest negativity in England... As a result, I think we&#x27;ve lost a lot of fans who didn&#x27;t come because of a lot of horror stories about how life would be in the Ukraine and Poland.&quot; Hodgson added that he had nothing but positive impressions of Poland and Ukraine.

According to the Dutch daily , during an open training session in Kraków, Dutch black players were allegedly subjected to monkey noises and jeers, an incident that the Holland captain Mark van Bommel described as a &quot;real disgrace&quot;. UEFA acknowledged that there had been &quot;isolated incidents of racist chanting&quot;. However, other Dutch media, including the prestigious daily , have reported that the allegations of monkey chants were made up. According to the newspaper, the coach of the Dutch team has made several statements to the BBC that he had not heard the supposed chanting, nor did the rest of the team. According to , the story was sensationalised by .

Jessica Elgot wrote an article in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; headlined &quot;I went all the way to &#x27;racist&#x27; Kiev and all I got was love&quot;, reporting how &quot;By-and-large, no one understood why we were going. Friends raised their eyebrows in horror, before inquiring if we had seen &quot;that Panorama programme&quot;. My grandmother politely inquired why we wanted to go to &quot;that shmatte place&quot;. As I left for the airport, I got a sweet good-bye text from my house-mate. &quot;Have a lovely trip. Please don&#x27;t get Jew-bashed.&quot;

The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; commented: &quot;The biggest plus of Euro 2012 must be the scaremongering presented by BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; of violence and terrible racism in Poland and Ukraine largely proved to be just that. If you do not believe me, then take the word of Gary Lineker who did not mind taking a swipe at his BBC bosses to point out how friendly and accommodating the locals have been. Ahead of Spain’s semi with Portugal, Lineker tweeted: &#x27;Donetsk is a lovely town with friendly folk. Pre-tournament scaremongering way off the mark.&#x27;&quot;

Tim Black, senior writer at &quot;Spiked&quot;, speculated that &quot;What seemed to drive &#x27;Stadiums of Hate&#x27; was not an intention to deceive, exactly. It was something else: an overriding willingness to believe the worst about people from &#x27;over there&#x27;. The East European &#x27;they&#x27; are not like &#x27;us&#x27;, the programme seemed to be saying: they are less developed, less socially advanced; they need our moral lessons, our anti-racist schooling. Amid the apparent social backwardness of Poland and Ukraine, the multicultural, cosmopolitan superiority of Western Europe can shine through. And we in Britain can bask in its glow.&quot;

The deputy mayor of Kraków, referring to the incidents of racism and anti-Semitism broadcast by &quot;Panorama&quot;, said: &quot;We believe that, step by step, the clubs will also take more responsibility for this kind of activity at stadiums&quot;. Adam Bulandra, project coordinator of the Interkulturalni Foundation and co-author of Kraków&#x27;s new anti-racist strategy said: &quot;The local community does not react properly to this problem, it does not actively oppose the incidents that happen, that&#x27;s why they are so visible, and we want to change this situation.&quot; A spokesperson for Poland&#x27;s Ombudsman for Citizens&#x27; Rights, noted that while there may seem to be only a small number of racist incidents in Poland, that 80 per cent of racist crimes go unreported in the country.

In 2014, &quot;Jewish News&quot; and other news organizations reported that during the making of the documentary, host Chris Rogers had been filmed giving a Nazi salute while marching in front of the crew. Rogers was reprimanded by the BBC, apologized and had not been re-hired by the &quot;Panorama&quot; program for two years after the incident.

===The Mind Reader: Unlocking My Voice===
This &quot;Panorama Special&quot; broadcast on 13 November 2012 showed the pioneering work being done by scientists to help patients who have suffered severe brain injuries. The film told the stories of a group of patients and their families, and showed the revolutionary efforts made to help them communicate with the outside world. The film included the story of Scott Routley, a Canadian man in a persistent vegetative state for more than a decade who was able to tell doctors he is not in any pain.

===North Korea Undercover===
&quot;North Korea Undercover&quot; was filmed in North Korea in late March 2013 by a 3-person team that accompanied a group of students from the London School of Economics. The trip was organised through the Grimshaw Club – an international relations club affiliated with LSE – by Tomiko Sweeney, the wife of John Sweeney. The North Koreans, who require permission for entry by journalists, and who have jailed journalists who have attempted unauthorised entry, were not informed of the BBC team and failed to recognize John Sweeney, calling him &quot;professor.&quot; The degree to which the students were informed led to a difference of opinion between the institutions later, with the BBC maintaining that less than full disclosure was a measure taken to protect the students in the event of discovery. Sweeney and his wife were accompanied by a BBC cameraman.

Subsequently, however, a public statement signed by six of the 10 LSE student participants on the trip said that &quot;We feel that we have now been put in more risk than was originally the case, as a result of the LSE&#x27;s decision to go public with their story&quot;. They also indicated that they had no objection to the broadcast of the BBC Panorama documentary and that they were satisfied with how the BBC handled the trip.

According to Gianluca Spezza, an informed critic and one of the directors of &quot;NK News&quot;, the documentary was of low quality, comparable to many of the videos frequently taken by tourists and posted to YouTube. In addition, according to Spezza, the undercover filming had a detrimental effect on responsible efforts to engage in legitimate cultural exchange and development of mutual understanding.

===Contaminated Blood: The Search for the Truth===
Originally broadcast on 10 May 2017, the 1-hour special episode &quot;Contaminated Blood: The Search for the Truth&quot; examined some of the events surrounding the contaminated blood scandal of the 1970s and 1980s, whereby haemophiliacs were infected with Hepatitis C and HIV via Factor VIII medicine products.

The programme featured former Health Ministers Andy Burnham and David Owen, both were critical of successive governments roles in the scandal, with the former suggesting it was &quot;criminal&quot;. Professor John Cash (former Director of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service) told the programme that the truth about the scandal in England and Wales &quot;[had] not yet been told&quot;.

One of the victims&#x27; sons, Jason Evans, told the programme he was taking legal action, which was subsequently billed by the press as a &quot;landmark legal case&quot;, calling for a public inquiry into records and documents of the scandal, with allegations that some records could have been destroyed at the time. The case, entitled &quot;Jason Evans &amp; Others V Secretary of State for Health&quot;, is ongoing ; an inquiry into the scandal, also ongoing , was announced by then-Prime Minister Theresa May shortly after the programme aired.

===Is Labour Anti-Semitic?===
The hour-long episode &quot;Is Labour Anti-Semitic?&quot; premiered on 10 July 2019 and explored allegations of antisemitism in the UK Labour Party. During the programme, eight former members of Labour party staff said that senior Labour figures had intervened to downgrade punishments handed out to members over antisemitism. The Labour Party criticised the programme prior to broadcast and issued the following statement afterwards:
&quot;The Panorama programme was not a fair or balanced investigation. It was a seriously inaccurate, politically one-sided polemic, which breached basic journalistic standards, invented quotes and edited emails to change their meaning. It was an overtly biased intervention by the BBC in party political controversy. An honest investigation into antisemitism in Labour and wider society is in the public interest. The Panorama team instead pre-determined an answer to the question posed by the programme&#x27;s title.&quot;
The programme was presented by John Ware and produced by Neil Grant, both of whom also worked on a 2015 &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, &quot;Labour&#x27;s Earthquake&quot;. Grant, who had been a teacher at JFS and London Labour Party activist, also produced a 2016 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme, &quot;Battle for the Labour Party&quot;. Both programmes were strongly criticised by supporters of party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Ken Loach called it &quot;probably the most disgusting programme I&#x27;ve ever seen on the BBC. Disgusting because it raised the horror of racism against Jews in the most atrocious propagandistic way, with crude journalism ... and it bought the propaganda from people who were intent on destroying Corbyn.&quot;

The Labour Party submitted a formal complaint about the programme to the BBC, which received around 1,600 complaints in total. The BBC&#x27;s Executive Complaints Unit rejected these complaints. Over 20 complaints of bias were taken to Ofcom, who ruled that the programme had been &quot;duly impartial&quot; and had given appropriate weight to Labour&#x27;s position.

After the episode aired, a party spokesman accused staff featured in the documentary of being &quot;disaffected former officials... who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind.&quot; Labour Party staff represented by the GMB Union voted 124–4 to demand the party apologise to the former staff and John Cryer, Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, said that attacking former Labour staff who appeared on the documentary was &quot;a gross misjudgment&quot;. Five of the staff featured announced their intention to sue the Party, claiming that Labour&#x27;s response breached its commitment to protect the rights of whistleblowers and &#x27;defamed&#x27; them.

In July 2020, the Labour Party, now under the leadership of Keir Starmer, retracted in full the allegations it had made about both John Ware and the participants in the Panorama documentary, which it conceded were false, issued a formal apology, and agreed to pay damages and costs, estimated to be around £600,000.

===Has the government failed the NHS?===

Broadcast on 27 April 2020, the episode &quot;Has the government failed the NHS?&quot;, presented by reporter Richard Bilton, investigated the UK Government&#x27;s alleged failure to stockpile critical equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE), and the impact this had on the management of COVID-19 within the NHS during the pandemic&#x27;s early months. The investigation also examined the reversal of the designation of COVID-19 as a &quot;High consequence infectious disease&quot; (HCID) and the simultaneous downgrading of PPE guidance. It was argued that the decision-making was fuelled, in part, by the lack of suitable equipment in the stockpile.

Among the interviewees was public health expert John Ashton, who described the findings as &quot;breathtaking&quot; and said &quot;The consequence of not planning; not ordering kit; not having stockpiles is that we are sending into the front line doctors, nurses, other health workers and social care workers without the equipment to keep them safe&quot;.

===The Missing Princess===
In February 2021, BBC Panorama released a full-fledged investigative documentary, &quot;The Missing Princess&quot;, about the daughter of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Princess Latifa, who attempted to flee her home country in 2018. However, she was captured and brought back to Dubai from international waters. In 2019, a family court in the UK ruled that Sheikh Mohammed had ordered the abduction of Princess Latifa, who was publicly seen only once since, in December 2018 during the visit of former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson.

&quot;The Missing Princess&quot; was released in 2021, after BBC Panorama received a video message secretly recorded by Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum from her bathroom in 2018. The messages were sent by Princess Latifa&#x27;s friends, who were not able to get in touch with her for a long time. The Princess accused her father, Sheikh Mohammed, of holding her &quot;hostage&quot;. She also gave details of her abduction, where she was drugged and brought back by Emirati soldiers on a boat and then a private jet. Saying that she feared for her life, Latifa complained about being tired in the solitary confinement without any medical and legal assistance.

Release of the documentary prompted the United Nations to intervene in the matter, where the organization questioned the United Arab Emirates about Princess Latifa and asked for a proof that she is alive.

==Programme influenced by security services==
In December 2011, it was revealed that former BBC Director General Sir Ian Trethowan had met in 1981 with the chiefs of MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service about an episode of &quot;Panorama&quot; dealing with the security services. He showed a video recording of the original programme to Bernard Sheldon, legal adviser to MI5, who suggested cuts to the programme. Trethowan asked the head of BBC News to reduce the programme to half its length, including the cuts suggested by MI5.

==Scheduling==
The scheduling of &quot;Panorama&quot; has, since the 1980s, often been a subject of media debate and controversy, due to the duties of the BBC to provide both, on the one hand, entertaining programming that appeals to a mass audience, and on the other serious journalism that might have a narrower audience. In February 1985, with the programme being watched by an average audience of just 3.5 million viewers, Controller of BBC One Michael Grade moved the programme from its traditional prime time 8.10 pm slot on Monday evenings back to 9.30 pm, after the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. Despite many protests about this move in the media, &quot;Panorama&quot; remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade&#x27;s successors, Alan Yentob and Michael Jackson, were known to be unhappy about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9 pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move &quot;Panorama&quot; back half an hour to 10 pm, to make way for the sitcom &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, which opened the BBC to criticism that it was sidelining serious content in favour of lighter programming.

In 2000, the programme was moved again, with the 10 pm timeslot no longer available due to the transferring of the BBC News from 9 pm to the later slot. &quot;Panorama&quot; was moved to Sunday nights, after the news, usually shown at around 10.15 pm – labelled by some critics as a &quot;graveyard slot&quot;. The number of editions made per year was also reduced, which attracted press criticism for the BBC in general and its Director-General Greg Dyke in particular, as Dyke was the driving force behind the schedule changes. The incoming Controller of BBC One, Lorraine Heggessey, defended the move, claiming that the programme&#x27;s audience would have &quot;dwindled&quot; had it remained on Monday nights.

In January 2007 Heggessey&#x27;s successor, Peter Fincham, moved &quot;Panorama&quot; back from Sunday nights to a prime time Monday evening slot at 8.30 pm, reduced to half an hour. This decision was at least partly in response to a demand from the Board of Governors of the BBC for the channel to show more current affairs programming during prime time.

== Legacy ==
A series of &quot;Panorama&quot; transcripts, dating between 1958 and 1961, are housed at the British Library. The papers can be accessed through the British Library catalogue.

<doc id="1130533" wikidata="Q206569" url="?curid=1130533" title="New Zealand Legislative Council">
<text>The New Zealand Legislative Council () was the upper house of the General Assembly of New Zealand between 1853 and 1951. An earlier arrangement of legislative councils for the colony and provinces existed from 1841 when New Zealand became a colony; it was reconstituted as the upper house of a bicameral legislature when New Zealand became self-governing in 1852, which came into effect in the following year.

Unlike the elected lower house, the House of Representatives, the Legislative Council was wholly appointed by the governor-general. The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 had authorised the appointment of a minimum of ten councillors. Beginning in the 1890s, the membership of the upper house became controlled by government of the day. As a result, the Legislative Council possessed little influence. While intended as a revising chamber, in practice, debates and votes typically simply replicated those in the lower house. It was abolished by an Act of Parliament in 1950, with its last sitting in December 1950.

The Council&#x27;s chamber is no longer utilised as a debating chamber, but it is used for certain ceremonial functions, such as the speech from the throne.

== Establishment ==

The first Legislative Council was established by the &quot;Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand&quot; on 16 November 1840, which created New Zealand as a Crown colony separate from New South Wales on 1 July 1841. Originally, the Legislative Council consisted of the governor, colonial secretary, and colonial treasurer, and a number of senior justices of the peace. The Legislative Council had the power to issue ordinances (statutory instruments).

With the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, the first Legislative Council was disestablished and a similar appointed body was established, effective from 1853. The new Legislative Council was constituted as the upper house of the General Assembly (or &quot;Parliament&quot;), which did not actually meet until 24 May 1854, 16 months after the Constitution Act had come into force.

== Role ==
The Legislative Council was intended to act as a revising chamber, scrutinising and amending bills which had been passed by the House of Representatives. It could not initiate bills, and was prohibited from amending money bills (legislation relating to finance and expenditure). The model for the Legislative Council&#x27;s role was the House of Lords in the United Kingdom.

== Membership ==

===Appointment and tenure===
The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 provided for councillors to be appointed for life terms by the governor. As the power of the governor over New Zealand politics gradually decreased, it became the convention that appointments were made on the recommendation of the premier (later prime minister), essentially meaning that councillors were selected by the government of the day.

However, the life term of councillors meant that the Legislative Council always lagged behind the House of Representatives—premiers were frequently hampered in their activities by a Legislative Council appointed by their predecessors. In 1891, life membership was replaced by a seven-year term by the new Liberal Party government of John Ballance. While many Liberals apparently favoured outright abolition, it offered minimal political benefit for a ruling government, and such a radical move would have unnecessarily provoked fears about the new administration. Instead, term limits were introduced primarily for practical reasons, as Ballance&#x27;s conservative predecessor, Harry Atkinson, had stacked the Council with seven conservatives shortly before leaving office. Ballance had considerable difficulty in achieving his reform of the Council, with major clashes occurring between him and the Governor, the Earl of Onslow, who had approved the seven appointments. Ballance&#x27;s victory is seen as establishing an important precedent in the relationship between governor and prime minister.

The structure of the Legislative Council prior to 1891 was therefore similar to that of the Canadian Senate (which continues as an appointed upper house, although senators are no longer appointed to life terms, and must retire at the age of 75).

The style &quot;The Honourable&quot; could be retained from 1894 by a councillor with not less than ten years service if recommended by the governor. This privilege was extended to one member, William Montgomery, in 1906; and a further eleven members in 1951 after abolition of the Council.

===Number of members===
It was specified in the Constitution Act 1852 that the Council would consist of at least ten members. Although not actually a part of the Act, instructions were issued that the number of members should not exceed fifteen. One member was to be selected as speaker of the Legislative Council, corresponding roughly to the position of speaker of the House of Representatives. A quorum of five members was established.

The first appointments to the Legislative Council were made in 1853, when thirteen members were called to the upper house. They were John Salmon, William Swainson and Frederick Whitaker on 26 May 1853; Mathew Richmond on 23 June 1853; and on 31 December 1853 Edmund Bellairs, George Cutfield, William Kenny, John Yeeden Lloyd, Ralph Richardson, Henry Seymour, Henry St. Hill, Henry Petre and John Watts-Russell. Gradually, the maximum number of members was raised, and the limit was eventually abolished. The Council reached a peak of 53 members in 1885 and 1950.

===Extent of representation===
The Legislative Council was generally less representative of the New Zealand public than was the House of Representatives. Women were not eligible to serve as councillors before 1941, and only five were appointed. Two, Mary Anderson and Mary Dreaver, were appointed in 1946 by the First Labour Government. In 1950, when the First National Government appointed several new members to vote the council out of existence, three women were included; Cora Louisa Burrell, Ethel Gould and Agnes Weston. Māori were slightly better represented. The first two Māori councillors were appointed in 1872, not long after the creation of the Māori electorates in the House; Mōkena Kōhere and Wi Tako Ngātata. A convention was established that there should always be Māori representation on the Council.

===1891 appointments===
In January 1891 the outgoing Atkinson Ministry appointed six new members to the Legislative Council, with the object of blocking any radical bills that John Ballance (who became Premier on 24 January) and his Liberal Government might introduce. They were the last appointments for life as the new government introduced a seven-year term. The new members were Charles Johnston and John Davies Ormond on 20 January; and Harry Atkinson (elected as speaker), James Fulton, William Downie Stewart, and John Blair Whyte on 22 January. John Hall had written to Ormond: &quot;It will be a serious disaster if the Council is not strengthened before the Reds get into the saddle.&quot;

Petitions were tabled against the &quot;stacking of the Council&quot; by MPs and by Aucklanders. But the stacking has been seen as assisting the Liberal Government, which &quot;might not have survived but for this assistance ... [which] provided a useful unifying influence in the critical early years&quot; and &quot;identified with dramatic clarity the reactionary class enemy ... and acted as a convenient brake on the radicals [who] were asked to settle for moderate measures.&quot;

===Proposals for election===
A number of proposals were made that the Legislative Council should be elected, not appointed. When responsible government had been granted at the beginning of the 2nd Parliament, the governor, Thomas Gore Browne, was given sufficient authority to make the Legislative Council elected, but no action was taken. In 1914, a reform proposal to establish a 42 or 43 member council elected by proportional representation for six years was introduced by the Liberals, but postponed due to World War I. In 1920 it was no longer favoured by the Reform government then in power. But the 1914 Act &quot;remained like a sword of Damocles suspended above the nominated upper house, available at will or whim to any succeeding government&quot;.

== Abolition ==

By the middle of the 20th century, the Legislative Council was increasingly being looked on as ineffectual and making little difference to the legislative process. The Legislative Council rarely criticised bills sent to it by the House, and many believed that it was now obsolete. Some favoured its reform, while others favoured its abolition; among the latter group was the leader of the National Party, Sidney Holland, who introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to abolish it in August 1947.

However, because the Parliament of New Zealand was unable to amend the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, it had to first adopt the Statute of Westminster 1931, which it did with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947. Following the adoption of the Act, the Parliament of New Zealand passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment (Request and Consent) Act 1947, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947, allowing the New Zealand Parliament to amend the Constitution Act and abolish the Legislative Council. However, the Labour government did not actually enact the abolition itself, and lost office in the 1949 general election.

In 1950, the National Party, now in government, passed the Legislative Council Abolition Act. To assist its passage into law, Holland appointed twenty members (who were dubbed the &quot;suicide squad&quot;) to vote for abolition, just as the Australian state of Queensland had done to abolish its upper house in 1922. They included former MPs Harold Dickie and Garnet Mackley.

To encourage co-operation from other members, Holland also promised to use the money saved through abolition to set up a fund for retired members. A Statutes Revision Committee (now defunct) was established to carry out some of the scrutiny that the Legislative Council had been intended for. Although abolition was intended as an interim measure, no serious attempts were made to introduce a new second chamber, and Parliament has been unicameral since.

== Proposed reestablishment ==
Support for bicameralism is not completely absent, and there have been occasional proposals for a new upper house or Senate. A constitutional reform committee chaired by Ronald Algie proposed an appointed Senate in 1952. The short-lived Liberal Party campaigned on re-establishing an upper house in the 1963 election. In 1990, the National government of Jim Bolger proposed an elected Senate, an idea advanced partly as an alternative to New Zealand&#x27;s electoral reform process.

Unicameralists in New Zealand, like former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer, argued that the country is a small and relatively homogeneous unitary state, and hence does not need the same arrangements as federal states like Australia or Canada. In addition, Peter Dunne, then also a Labour MP, argued that other political reforms in New Zealand such as the strengthening of the select committee system, and the introduction of proportional representation, provided adequate checks and balances, which would simply be duplicated by a second chamber.

== Legislative Council Chamber ==
The Legislative Council Chamber remains the location of the speech from the throne—as following the British tradition, the sovereign (or a representative) does not enter the elected House. The usher of the Black Rod summons the members of the House of Representatives to attend the Opening of Parliament in the Legislative Council Chamber, where a speech is read usually by the governor-general. It is also used for some select committee meetings, as well as meetings of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and other official functions.

Beuzeville itself is about 10 miles from Honfleur, and 18 miles from Deauville. It has the sea to the North, and the Seine estuary to the East. Although just outside the &quot;département&quot; of Calvados, the production of the apple brandy known as Calvados is also produced there, and is the reason for the many apple orchards which are a distinguishing characteristic of the surrounding countryside. Agriculture and tourism are the main industries.

<text>As distinct from the Western medical concept of the pericardium, this concept from traditional Chinese medicine describes a set of interrelated parts rather than an anatomical organ (see Zang Fu theory).

The Pericardium network includes the pericardial sac, the Pericardium meridian, the small intestine and some parts of the brain.

The Pericardium is also called the &quot;heart protector&quot;, and, for clinical purposes, is considered a yin organ paired with the yang organ San Jiao. In general theory, the Pericardium is not distinguished from the Heart. It is also the first line of defence against the Heart from External Pathogenic Influences. In terms of the Five Elements, these organs are both associated with the fire element. 

The Pericardium has a meridian named for it, which reflects the health of the organ. According to traditional Chinese medicine, it is often best to approach the treatment of heart problems via the Pericardium, rather than the heart directly.

<text>Tatikios or Taticius (, c. 1048 – died after 1110) was an Eastern Roman general of Turkish origin during the reign of Alexios I Komnenos. His name is also rendered as Tetigus, Tatizius, Tatitius, Tatic, or Tetig.

==Origins and early life==
The father of Tatikios was a &quot;Saracen&quot;, probably meaning a Turk, who was captured by Alexius&#x27; father John Comnenus and who served as a slave in the Comnenus household. Tatikios and Alexius grew up together. Tatikios is described as an &quot;oikogenes&quot; of Alexius (that is, &quot;from the same house&quot;). 

In 1078, before Alexius became emperor, Tatikios accompanied him in battle against his rival Nicephorus Basilacius. During this campaign Tatikios discovered Basilacius&#x27; plans for an ambush. When Alexius became emperor in 1081 Tatikios held the office of &quot;megas primikerios&quot; in the imperial household. Later that year he commanded the &quot;Turks living around Ochrida&quot;, perhaps Hungarians at the Battle of Dyrrhachium against Robert Guiscard.

==Military and political career==
In 1086 Tatikios was sent to Nicaea in an attempt to recapture it from the Seljuks. He was forced to retreat when he learned that Seljuk reinforcements were on their way. Alexius sent Tatikios back with naval assistance from Manuel Boutoumites. Although Tatikios was able to defeat Abu&#x27;l Qasim, in Bithynia, he could not recapture the city. At the end of the year Tatikios was recalled and sent to fight the Pechenegs, who were assisting the heretical Manichaeans in revolt against Alexius, near Philippopolis. In 1087 Tatikios commanded the Byzantine right wing in the Battle of Dristra against the Pechenegs, and in 1090 he defeated a small force of 300 Pechenegs while leading the &quot;Archontopouloi&quot; &quot;tagma&quot; against them.

In early 1094, Tatikios was placed in charge of guarding Alexius&#x27; tent at Pentegostis. Here he discovered the plot of Nikephoros Diogenes, son of the former emperor Romanus IV Diogenes, to kill the emperor. Nicephorus was an old friend of Alexius and Tatikios and Alexius was reluctant to punish him, but it was clear that Nicephorus was ambitious for the throne. Nicephorus was exiled and was eventually blinded. Later in 1094, Tatikios attended the synod of Blachernae which condemned Bishop Leo of Chalcedon, presumably performing some function of security. In the records of this synod Tatikios is given the court title of &quot;protoproedros&quot;.

In 1095 Tatikios accompanied Alexius in the campaign against the Cumans.

==Role during the First Crusade==
In 1096 Tatikios defended Constantinople from peasant crusaders who attacked the city after their arrival. In 1097 Tzitas, commanding 2000 peltasts (Byzantine peltasts differed from those used in Ancient Greece), was sent by Alexius to Nicaea to assist the Crusaders in their siege of the city. The Frankish chronicler Albert of Aix says that Tatikios acted as an envoy between the Turks and the crusaders, but according to the more reliable Anna Comnena, he was working with Boutoumites to negotiate the surrender of the city without the Crusaders&#x27; knowledge. This caused a deep rift between the Latins and Greeks. 

However, Tatikios was ordered to accompany the Crusaders across Anatolia, both as a guide and also to ensure that any former Byzantine territory re-captured was returned to the Empire. After leaving Nicaea, the Crusaders split into two groups. Tatikios accompanied the Norman (under Guiscard&#x27;s son Bohemund of Taranto, Bohemund&#x27;s nephew Tancred, and Robert of Normandy) and Flemish (under Robert of Flanders) contingents. The &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; records that Tatikios frequently warned the Crusaders of the ferocity of the Turks. 

During the siege of Antioch, Raymond of Aguilers writes that Tatikios advised the Crusaders to disperse and capture the surrounding countryside before attacking the city itself, which would also help them avoid a famine (this advice was ignored). In February 1098 he left the siege; according to Anna, who probably talked to Tatikios personally or had access to his reports, Tatikios was informed by Bohemund that the other Crusaders mistrusted him and had threatened his life. Bohemund, on the other hand, spread the rumour that Tatikios was a coward and a traitor, and had fled the army never intending to return, despite his promises to bring back reinforcements and provisions from Constantinople. This is the account preserved in contemporary crusader chronicles, who refer to him as a great enemy and a liar (&quot;periurio manet et manebit&quot;, according to the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot;); Anna&#x27;s account, of course, may be influenced by her deep prejudice against Bohemund, a long-standing enemy of her father.

The accusation of betrayal against Tatikios appears to be unjustified. The Byzantine general had left his personal possessions in the crusader camp and hence forfeited them. More conclusively, on 4 March 1098, a few weeks after the departure of Tatikios, a fleet bearing food supplies and siege materials for the crusader army outside Antioch arrived at the port of St Simeon. The modern historian Peter Frankopan suggests that Alexius was by now confident enough in the established links between Byzantium and the leaders of the crusade to retain his liaison officer in Constantinople for other duties.

==Appearance and descendants==
The Crusade chroniclers mention that Tatikios had a mutilated nose. Mutilation of the face was a common Byzantine punishment for traitors but this does not appear to be the case in this instance. According to Guibert of Nogent he had a prosthetic gold nose as a replacement. Contrary to the Crusaders&#x27; opinions of him, Anna describes him as &quot;a valiant fighter, a man who kept his head under combat conditions,&quot; and &quot;a clever orator and a powerful man of action.&quot; Anna also tells the story that Tatikios and Alexius were playing polo when the general was thrown from his horse and landed on the emperor. Alexius injured his knee in the incident and was thereafter afflicted by gout. Anna does not mention the date of this incident; it is an aside in her account of Alexius&#x27; campaigns against the Turks around 1110. 

There is no record of the dates of Tatikios&#x27; birth or death. Although the office of Grand Primicerius (&quot;megas primikerios&quot;) was usually held by a eunuch, some records suggest Tatikios had descendants who were members of a powerful noble family in the 12th century, including another general, prominent at the Battle of Sirmium, under Manuel I Comnenus. A possible descendant, Constantine Tatikios, was deprived of his sight following a failed plot against Isaac Angelos.

<doc id="1130568" wikidata="Q2458927" url="?curid=1130568" title="Lost and Found (Mudvayne album)">
<text>Lost and Found is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Mudvayne. The album was released on April 12, 2005. The album had major success in the U.S., debuting at number 2 and being certified gold by the RIAA shortly afterward. It has sold about 1,000,000 copies as of August 2014 and is the band&#x27;s most successful album to date.

==Production==
After opening for Metallica on the band&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium tour in 2003, Mudvayne spent the holidays recuperating before starting work on the album. The album was produced by Dave Fortman. The band chose Fortman because they felt he could combine the band&#x27;s extreme elements.

Before heading to The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California to record the album, the band spent time with Fortman in pre-production. Vocalist Chad Gray said &quot;I&#x27;ve found that those first few days are the most important when it comes to setting the album&#x27;s tone and challenging the band about their goals and fine-tuning the arrangements for maximum emotional impact.&quot; The band rented a ranch in Northern California where they wrote and rehearsed songs for the album. They converted its multi-stall garage into a makeshift studio. As with the band&#x27;s previous album, Mudvayne chose to isolate themselves to provide inspiration for their songwriting. Matthew McDonough stated &quot;Establishing clear goals for each song has been the key to Mudvayne&#x27;s quick results. It&#x27;s a strange contradiction, but it can be very liberating to set limitations on creativity as long as you don&#x27;t let those limitations define you. It frees up a lot of creative energy when you stop pulling an idea in fifty different directions and start pushing it in one.&quot;

By May 27, 2004, the band had finished writing 12 songs for the album. Chad, Ryan, Greg and Matthew left the ranch in Santa Cruz and went back to their respective homes in California, Illinois and Wisconsin. On June 12, 2004, the band reconvened to commence recording the album.

The song &quot;Small Silhouette&quot; was recorded during the &quot;Lost and Found&quot; sessions, with it later appearing on the soundtrack album to the Showtime series &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Lost and Found&quot; was described as a hard rock album by &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;. It includes elements of thrash metal. The song &quot;Determined&quot; (originally titled &quot;Fucking Determined&quot;) utilizes elements of modern thrash and hardcore punk, while the song &quot;IMN&quot;&#x27;s lyrics revolve around suicide, a recurring theme in Mudvayne&#x27;s songs. The track &quot;Choices&quot; was described by Gray as &quot;the eight-minute opus&quot;. It is to date the longest Mudvayne song.

The band sees the album as a return to the raw sound heard on &quot;L.D. 50&quot;, with guitarist Greg Tribbett saying in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine &quot;Instead of being all slick, we&#x27;re definitely going for a raw sound on this record. The last one was pretty smooth and the first record, &quot;L.D. 50&quot;, was raw, so we&#x27;re kind of mixing it up a little bit.&quot; Matthew McDonough said he believed the music on the album would reflect a refinement of Mudvayne&#x27;s complexly structured hard rock balanced against more melody than any previous album. Bassist Ryan Martinie added, &quot;Our goal for the third album is to make music that pleases us because if it makes us happy then the rest will take care of itself.&quot;

==Promotion==
Music videos were made for all four singles: &quot;Determined&quot;, &quot;Happy?&quot;, &quot;Forget to Remember&quot; and &quot;Fall into Sleep&quot;. The music video for &quot;Determined&quot; shows the band playing the song in front of a large group of moshing fans. It was recorded in New York City. &quot;Determined&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot; while &quot;Happy?&quot; appeared in the video game &quot;MX vs. ATV Untamed&quot; and was also used as the theme song for WWE&#x27;s Vengeance.

==Reception==

The album sold 100,000 copies in its first week of release.

Upon release, the album received generally mixed reviews, with Metacritic giving it a score of 46%. Some critics noted a perceived change in sound on the album aimed towards a more mainstream audience. The &quot;Kansas Wichita Eagle&quot; observed, &quot;Success wasn&#x27;t something the members of Mudvayne set out to achieve, but they won&#x27;t spurn it. Since the quartet&#x27;s arrival on the heavy metal scene in 1996, it has progressed from the fringes to the rock mainstream.&quot;

A positive review appeared in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, which wrote, &quot;Weaving crystallized melodies into their signature rage clusters, the metalheads dip a toe in clearer waters without losing any of the grime.&quot;

Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the opening track, &quot;Determined&quot;, writing in his review, &quot;They nail it on opener &quot;Determined&quot;—one of Mudvayne&#x27;s all-time strongest tracks, it&#x27;s a fist-swinging blast of modernized thrash.&quot; However, he gave the album a mixed review, writing, &quot;&quot;Lost and Found&quot; soon falls into the familiar, busting no-one-understands-me lyrics and matching moments of refreshing rawness to stretches of stereotypical &#x27;corporate metal,&#x27; a non-genre that&#x27;s risen up to accept loud rock refugees and the harder side of post-grunge. The energy in &#x27;Determined&#x27; and &#x27;Just&#x27; is sapped by the meandering &#x27;TV Radio&#x27; and &#x27;Fall into Sleep,&#x27; and ultimately Mudvayne gets lost between thrash and diluted Slipknot devotion.&quot;

Mixed reviews also appeared in &quot;Q&quot;, which said, &quot;[Mudvayne] remain[s] spirit-crushingly average&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which called the album &quot;Syncopated sludge that will connect only with aging burnouts and the angriest of young &#x27;uns&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot;, which wrote, &quot;The album is, while not terrible, not very memorable, either.&quot;

&quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album a negative review, writing, &quot;&quot;Lost and Found&quot; is ultimately a pointless album, one that might have sold well six years ago, but comes across as drab and hopelessly passé today.&quot;

The song &quot;Determined&quot; was nominated at the 2006 Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance but lost to Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;Before I Forget&quot;.

==Other releases==
Demo versions of &quot;Fall into Sleep&quot;, &quot;Happy?&quot; and &quot;All That You Are&quot;, and an acoustic version of &quot;Forget to Remember&quot; appeared on the 2007 compilation &quot;By the People, for the People&quot;, which was compiled from selections voted for by fans through the band&#x27;s website. The album versions of &quot;Determined&quot;, &quot;Fall into Sleep&quot; and &quot;Happy?&quot; appeared on the compilation &quot;Playlist: The Very Best of Mudvayne&quot; in 2011.

<text>William Bainbridge Renshaw (October 11, 1816 – January 1, 1863) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. He was killed during the Second Battle of Galveston.

==Biography==
Renshaw was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a naval family. His father, Commodore James Renshaw, had served with William Bainbridge, and subsequently named his son for the naval hero. Renshaw followed his father into the U.S. Navy and was appointed as a midshipman in November 1831. He served on a variety of sailing ships and outposts for the next twenty years.

He was appointed commander on April 26, 1861, during the early days of the Civil War. Renshaw was attached to Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s squadron for most of the war and was commended for the &quot;handsome manner in which he managed his vessel&quot;, , during Mortar Flotilla operations on the Mississippi River in 1862. 

He was in charge of the Union fleet blockading the port of Galveston, Texas, toward the end of the year, and fought in the First Battle of Galveston. On January 1, 1863, during the Second Battle of Galveston, Renshaw refused to surrender his flagship. He set fire to her to keep her out of Confederate hands, but died in the ensuing explosion. His failure to intercept the cotton ships cost the Union the battle.

==Namesakes==
Three later U.S. Navy ships have been named . The first was jointly named for him and his younger brother, Richard T. Renshaw. The later two were solely for William Renshaw.

<doc id="1130576" wikidata="Q693579" url="?curid=1130576" title="Notre Dame Mountains">
<text>The Notre Dame Mountains are a portion of the Appalachian Mountains, extending from the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec to the Green Mountains of Vermont.

The range runs from northeast to southwest, forming the southern edge of the St. Lawrence River valley, and following the Canada–United States border between Quebec and Maine. The mountainous New Brunswick &quot;panhandle&quot; is located in the Notre Dame range as well as the uppermost reaches of the Connecticut River valley in New Hampshire.

As the mountains are geologically old, they have eroded to an average height of around .

==Etymology==
&quot;Notre Dame&quot; is French for &quot;Our Lady,&quot; a Catholic term referring to the Virgin Mary.

While on an expedition on 15 August 1535, Jacques Cartier wrote: The &quot;jour Notre Dame d&#x27;aoust XVe&quot; refers to the feast of the Assumption of Mary, commemorated in the Catholic Church on 15 August. The following autumn, maps he authored carried the name &quot;haultes montaignes de Honguedo.&quot; However, it was the title of &quot;Notre Dame&quot; that would propagate quickly throughout the 16th century, with French navigator Jean Alfonse referring to them as the &quot;montz Nostre Dame&quot; in his 1544 work &quot;Cosmographie&quot;, followed by Gerardus Mercator in 1569.

==Geography==
===Topography===
The Notre Dame Mountains are the principal subrange of the Appalachian Mountains in Quebec. Within Quebec, the range parallels the St. Lawrence River until its terminus at the eastern end of the Gaspé Peninsula. However, the southern limit of the range is the subject of some debate, though some sources consider either Lake Memphremagog or the US border as the southern edge of the Notre Dame Mountains.

The Chic-Choc Mountains are one of the primary subranges of the Notre Dame Mountains. They are located in the northeastern part of the Gaspé Peninsula and are home to the tallest mountain in the range, Mont Jacques-Cartier, with an elevation of . The other major subsection of the Notre Dame Mountains is the Massif du Sud, which is found in the southern part of the range, southeast of Quebec City, and reaches an elevation of .

===Geology===

==Conservation==
The Notre Dame Mountains are protected by several parks, both federally by Parks Canada and provincially by the Quebec Sépaq and New Brunswick:

* Forillon National Park
* Bic National Park
* Frontenac National Park
* Lake Témiscouata National Park
* Gaspésie National Park
* Mount Carleton Provincial Park

<text>Adam Fleetwood is a British racing driver. He won the British Hillclimb Championship in both 2003 and 2004 driving a Gould GR55, and in the latter year won an unprecedented 28 of the 34 rounds of the series. In the process he broke all but one outright hill records, and became the first driver to complete the Shelsley Walsh course in under 24 seconds. However, his main rival, Graeme Wight Jr, did not compete at all (one or two guest appearances in other cars aside) in the second half of the 2004 season. As he was awaiting completion of a new car, which did not become available by the end of the season.

Before making the step up to the top category of hillclimbing, Fleetwood had previously competed with distinction in smaller-engined single-seater cars, setting several class records in the process.

In April 2005, Fleetwood announced that family and other commitments (such as his preparation for competing in the British Porsche Carrera Cup) would preclude his appearance in the rest of that season&#x27;s championship, although in the end he did compete in a small number of climbs.

<doc id="1130590" wikidata="Q2334083" url="?curid=1130590" title="Kaifūsō">
<text>The is the earliest extant anthology of literary Sinitic poetry (&quot;kanshi&quot;) written by Japanese poets.

It was compiled in 751. In the brief introduction of the poets, the unknown writer seems sympathetic to Emperor Kōbun and his regents who were overthrown in 672 by Emperor Tenmu after only eight months of rule. Thus, it has been traditionally credited to Ōmi no Mifune (722–785), a great grandson of Emperor Kōbun. It also has been said that Fujii no Hironari (n.d., fl. first half of 8th century) and Isonokami no Yakatsugu (729–781) could be the compiler. 

The kanji 藻 () in the title means &quot;water-plant&quot;, which is a metaphor for elegant style. The work is a collection of 120 works by 64 poets written in the elegant style of poetry built on Tang dynasty models in the eighth century. Most of the poets are imperial family members, court officials and monks, such as Prince Ōtsu. Eighteen of the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot; poets, including Prince Ōtsu, also have poems selected in a later anthology of Japanese poetry, the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;. Most poems come from poetry banquets for seasonal festivals, imperial excursions, or banquets hosted for Silla envoys.

At the time the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot; was written, Sinitic poetry had a higher place in the Japanese literary world than &quot;waka&quot;, and Chinese characters were used for official documents. Composition in literary Sinitic became widespread during the reign of Emperor Tenji (668–671, r.661–672). In the preface of the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot;, a distinction is made between the basic technology of writing and the embossed poetry and beautiful prose that arose through, and that completed the regulation and ritual of, the new code-based state. Just as the &quot;Wen Xuan&quot; preface provided inspiration for the vision of literary history in the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot; preface, Chinese medieval poetry provided a model of individual authorship and a rich treasury for sophisticated diction.

<text>Pompeia (before AO 1990: Pompéia) is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 22,172 (2020) within an area of 784 km2. In 2000, its Human Development Index was 0.816.

== History ==
The region of Pompeia was originally inhabited by Kaingang natives, called &quot;Coroados&quot; (&quot;Crowned&quot;) by the Portuguese colonizers. The first settlers arrived in 1852, when the Imperial Government granted João Antonio de Moraes, Francisco de Paula Morais and Francisco Rodrigues de Campos occupancy over the lands in the surroundings of Rio do Peixe and Aguapeí River (São Paulo).

In 1919, Júlio da Costa Barros purchased a share of Guataporanga farm for agricultural purposes. In the following three years, the first Coffea plantations started to grow. Later on, abiding by a condition from Guataporanga Farm&#x27;s landowner, Barros founded Vila de Novo Cravinhos, name given after Cravinhos, where the first customers of theirs came from. The clear-cutting nearby started along with the construction of former Noroeste do Brasil Railroad in order to link the cities of Bauru (São Paulo) and Corumbá (Mato Grosso do Sul).

Jacutinga Farm was the first to arise in the environs. Its landowner Rodolfo Lara Campos acquired it in order to grown Coffea large-scale profit crops and started the deforestation of the region where later the city of Pompeia would be established. In 1928, Rodolfo and Luiz Miranda planned the foundation of a city and commanded the cutting of a 250 hectare area, which was named &quot;Patrimônio de Otomânia&quot; (&quot;Otomânia&#x27;s Patrimony) and after being divided into lots the first of those began to be sold. A few years later, &quot;Patrimônio&quot; was officially renamed &quot;Pompeia&quot; after senator Rodolfo Miranda&#x27;s wife, Aretuza Pompeia.

The municipality was created by state law in 1938.
As several cities of the state of São Paulo, Pompeia was majorly populated by Portuguese, Italian and Japanese immigrants. The latter&#x27;s culture even nowadays is still remarkable in traditional festivities and the architectural design of the city, e.g. many bus stops have roofs with eaves curved.

==Demographics==
== Education ==
Pompeia has become a reference in Education within the state of São Paulo and also in nationwide indicators. It was listed as one of the 500 cities that offer more educational opportunitites in Brazil. Since 2013, Shunji Nishimura Foundation of Technology has collaborated with Faculdade de Tecnologia offering graduation courses of Mechanization of Precision Agriculture and Big Data in Agribusiness, which has contributed to transform the city into a new hub for higher education.

== Máquinas Agrícolas Jacto ==
In 1948, the Jacto Group was founded in the city by Japanese immigrant Shunji Nishimura, who arrived in Brazil in 1932. Graduated at , Nishimura and his family developed agricultural fixing equipment which gradatively gained more popularity among farmers and agricultural families in the countryside of not only São Paulo but also other states of Brazil.

The company has been one of the top earners of the city and a major revenue stream of the Midwestern state of São Paulo. The Nishimura family was also responsible for the Shunji Nishimura Foundation of Technology, created to provide farmers testing services to determine soil fertility and analyze plant tissues, as well as working on continuous technological improvement in rural areas.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Religion ==

Christianity is present in the city as follows:

=== Catholic Church ===
The Catholic church in the municipality is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marília.

=== Protestant Church ===
The most diverse evangelical beliefs are present in the city, mainly Pentecostal, including the Assemblies of God in Brazil (the largest evangelical church in the country), Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others. These denominations are growing more and more throughout Brazil.

<text>Piquerism (derived from the French &quot;piquer&quot;—&quot;to prick&quot;) refers to a sexual interest in penetrating the skin of another person with sharp objects (such as pins, razors, knives, etc.). Sometimes, this is serious enough to cause extreme injuries or even death. Piquerism is a paraphilia as well as a form of sadism. The most frequently targeted areas of the body are the breasts, buttocks, and groin.

==Examples==

===Jack the Ripper===
Dr. Robert D. Keppel and his colleagues concluded in an analysis of London&#x27;s Jack the Ripper murders of 1888 that &quot;the injuries sustained by the victims displayed the signature characteristic of picquerism.&quot;

=== Andrei Chikatilo ===
A Soviet serial killer who operated in the late 70s and early 80s, the Rostov Ripper, after he murdered his first victim, 9 year old Yelena Zakotnova, was able to achieve erection and orgasm only upon the stabbing and slashing of women and children to death.

=== Frank Ranieri ===
A 25-year old American was arrested in June 2007 for bribing multiple young females with large sums of money in exchange for poking their buttocks with sharp objects.

<doc id="1130603" wikidata="Q377601" url="?curid=1130603" title="Poá">
<text>Poá is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The water extracted from &quot;Fonte Áurea&quot;, or the Golden Fountain, is sold throughout Brazil. The population is 103,765 (2022 est.) in an area of 17.26 km2.

== General appearance ==
Poá is one of the eleven municipalities in São Paulo considered to be spas by the state of São Paulo, as they meet certain prerequisites defined by state law. This status guarantees these municipalities a larger budget from the state for the development of regional tourism. In addition, the municipality acquires the right to add to its name the title of spa, a term by which it is designated both in official municipal records and in state references. The main sector of Poá&#x27;s economy is services, since the installation of polluting industries was made difficult after 1970, the year in which it became a spa. In terms of territory, it is one of the smallest municipalities in the state of São Paulo (larger only than Águas de São Pedro and São Caetano do Sul). The verticalization of the city center is discouraged, with the aim of preserving the city&#x27;s rural atmosphere, with narrow streets and the preservation of several old buildings.

==History==
The municipality was created by state law in 1948.

Poá is one of eleven municipalities considered spa towns (Estancia Hidromineral) by the state of São Paulo, fulfilling certain prerequisites set by state law. This status ensures that these municipalities more money from the state to promote regional tourism and beyond that the city acquired the right to add the title &quot;Estancia Hidromineral&quot; to its name, a term which is designated by both the municipal expedient as the official state references. Poá&#x27;s economy is mainly service-focused, since the installation of polluting industries has been banned since 1970, the year it became a spa town. Territory-wise, is one of the smallest municipalities in the state of São Paulo (only bigger than Aguas de São Pedro and São Caetano do Sul).

Verticalization in the city center is discouraged to preserve the small-town atmosphere of the city, with narrow streets and the preservation of several old buildings. The council is not the richest in the region, but still outperforms its neighbors in several social indicators, thus signaling that the economic growth of Poá is more equal and sustainable than in other cities, and that its population has a better quality of life due to public facilities (schools, parks and health units). In indexes like the human development index, the child development index and the index of development of basic education, Poá surpasses all municipalities. In 2007 it was considered one of the safest cities of São Paulo, specifically the 5th, behind only São Caetano do Sul, Barueri, Caieiras and Mogi das Cruzes.

==Geography==

== Tourism ==
Poá has a strong vocation for tourism, although this sector of the economy still is not the main activity of the municipality. Because of the lack of investment, the city hardly explores this market.

An example of a tourist attraction, is the municipal spa Vicente Leporace, located in front of the 
Fonte Aúrea, which was opened in 1970 as a condition for the council to receive the title of hidromineral and tourist resort. After being used for 30 years, it was deactivated at the beginning of the decade, because the mayor at the time, Eduardo Carlos Felippe, felt that there was no need to have a spa in the city. Since then the site is used as a physiotherapy center.

===EXPOÁ ===

Because there are a lot of orchids existing in Poá and throughout the Upper Tietê, because of the favorable climate for the cultivation of the plant, in 1970 the Exhibition of Orchids and Ornamental Plants of Poá, better known as EXPOÁ, was established with the goal &quot;to increase tourism in the city, as well as to provide a tribute to nature&quot;. The exhibition is recognized by the State Ministry of Sports and Tourism of the São Paulo State Government and since 1976 is part of the National Calendar of the Brazilian Institute of Tourism (formerly Embratur), linked to the Ministry of Tourism. It is held every year in September. From 1983 to 1993 the Expo was held at the Municipal Gymnasium Sports Americo Franco at Golden Village, and is currently held in the Event Square Lucilia Felippe Gomes, receiving approximately 300,000 visitors per year.

At the time of its inauguration, the building of ETEC Poá was considered by the Paula Souza Center, &quot;one of the best network.&quot; The average candidate ETEC of Poá in 2009 was 6.1 applicants per vacancy.

In Poá, there are several locations available to the population, which were built from emancipation. The gym hall for example, located in Golden Village, started construction on January 25, 1957, by the state government.
There are several sports associations legally registered in Poá. Three clubs, meanwhile, stands out for their ancient foundation and participation within the community: Esporte Clube XI Paulista, Poaense Athletic Association, Sports Club Concordia Poaense, and other associations like the Rotary Club and the Lyons Club offer free courses in rhythmic gymnastics, futsal, beach volleyball, capoeira, boxing, volleyball, basketball, judo, karate, and handball, among others, in their own municipal gymnasium and sports groups installed in neighborhoods such as those in towns and Julia Varela and St. Joseph&#x27;s Garden.

Sports competitions are held sporadically in the various fields in the city, as in the neighborhoods Teresa Palma, Jardim América, Garden St. Helena, Juliet Villa, Villa Giulia, in the New Forest Poá, Vila Monteiro, Calmon Viana, together with companies neighborhood friends. Also occur capoeiristas meetings, the challenge of beach volleyball, indoor soccer battle, and streetball, among others. The skate park built in 2000, is installed next to the viaduct at the Centre, is open to the public and receives championships annually.
Poá also has cultural spaces like the Public Library, Cultural Center and Municipal Museum Taiguara House Station. The squares within the existing neighborhoods and in the central region are also leisure facilities. The squares of the Bible and Events, for example, function as parks, as have recreational equipment such as playgrounds, restrooms and security.
The Carnival is also a very traditional activity in the city, where there are parades of samba schools for over thirty years. Poá currently has ten active samba schools, among which we mention: the New Academic Poá, Empire Village Vampré, Clover Gold, Ultima Hora, Jau Village, and Villa Julia, among others.

Sectors of the economy
The economic sector of Poá has several activities:
Industrial: After he received the title of office hidromineral, was prohibited the installation of polluting industries in the municipality, that in the 1970s, and those that existed have been given to move to a more rigid environmental legislation, to help preserve the groundwater in the city. The change resulted in the departure of some industries, but even so Poá houses large industries, among the nearly 200 installed on its territory. Highlights for the manufacturer of refractory Ibar (Brazilian Industry of Refractory items) which was installed in Poá five years before the emancipation of the municipality, the maker of electrical cables Inducabos, and the Brazilian subsidiary of the multinational Aunde, which produces automotive fabrics. Together, Ibar and Aunde occupy nearly half the area of Calmon Viana. The district that was formed between the two industries was renamed Vila Ibar.

Shopping: The main shopping streets of the city are street March 26 and July 9 Avenue that is in the center, housing most of the banks and &quot;anchor stores&quot; of the city. There are other commercial corridors such as Lucas Nogueira Garcez Avenue and Avenida Getulio Vargas, among others. It is estimated that there are approximately 2,000 commercial premises.
Services: It is the sector of the economy that is more present in the city. There are various tax incentive laws and among them, and that attracts companies of its kind, is to reduce the tax on services (ISS), which has a much lower rate than in most towns. While its neighbor St. Paul (a city that focuses more on services company in Brazil), charge rate of 5% for most service activities, in Poá charge rate of 2%. are more than 20,000 service providers, among which we highlight the holding company of Banco Safra (Safra Leasing, located in the center) and Banco Itau (Itau Administradora Consortia and Itaucard Bank, both located in Vila das Acacias - also in the central region) and the subsidiary company of São Paulo TMKT telemarketing, (installed in Calmon Viana).

There is also horticultural activity in rural areas little is left of the city after the dispute of territory with Suzano in the 1950s and 1960s. Tourism began to be promoted now, in the early 2000s (decade). Yet the main event done in the city, the Expo comes to attract 350,000 people in seven days.

<text>Alexander Slidell MacKenzie (January 24, 1842 – June 13, 1867) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
He was the son of Catherine Alexander (Robinson) and Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, both of whom were natives of New York City. His father was a well-known naval officer whose career had been surrounded in controversy; his uncles included William Alexander Duer, John Slidell, and Matthew C. Perry. By the time of his birth, his parents had purchased a farm on the Hudson between Tarrytown and Sing Sing. His father died suddenly September 13, 1848, at his residence, near Tarrytown, N.Y., of heart disease.

==Military service==
Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1855, he graduated in June 1859 and was assigned to the newly completed steam sloop of war Hartford. During the next two years, Midshipman MacKenzie served in that ship with the East India Squadron. Promoted to Lieutenant in August 1861, he was an officer of the gunboat Kineo during the conquest of the lower Mississippi River in 1862. During 1863 and 1864 he later transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, MacKenzie served off Charleston, South Carolina, in the steam frigate Wabash and monitor Patapsco, taking part in combat operations against Fort Sumter and Morris Island. Later in the civil war he commanded the gunboat Winona, also in the waters off South Carolina. In July 1865 MacKenzie received the rank of Lieutenant Commander and soon began a second Far Eastern deployment in Hartford.

After the end of the war, he returned to the East Asia in &quot;Hartford&quot;, in which he served until June 13, 1867, when he was killed in action at Kenting, Taiwan, while leading a punitive expedition against the massacre of the entire crew of an American merchant bark &quot;Rover&quot;.

==Namesakes==
Three ships of the Navy have been named USS &quot;MacKenzie&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="1130618" wikidata="Q162217" url="?curid=1130618" title="Subutai">
<text>Subutai (Classical Mongolian: &quot;Sübügätäi&quot; or &quot;Sübü&#x27;ätäi&quot;; Modern Mongolian: ; Сүбээдэй, &quot;Sübeedei&quot;. ; ; c. 1175–1248) was a Mongol general and the primary military strategist of Genghis Khan and Ögedei Khan. He ultimately directed more than 20 campaigns, during which he conquered more territory than any other commander in history as part of the expansion of the Mongol Empire, the largest contiguous empire in human history. He often gained victory by means of sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that operated hundreds of kilometers apart from each other. Subutai is regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in history, and the single greatest in Mongolian history. He was instrumental in the conquests of Genghis and Ögedei Khan.

==Early life==
Historians believe Subutai was born in the year 1175, probably just west of the upper Onon River in what is now Mongolia. Some historical accounts claim that he belonged to the Uriankhai clan. As a member of the reindeer people, according to these accounts, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.

However, recent scholarship has discounted this earlier narrative. Stephen Pow and Jingjing Liao note that &quot;...the sense of irony conjured by imagining that the Mongol Empire’s greatest general was a reindeer-herding outsider to steppe nomadic culture has a strong literary appeal to modern authors.&quot;

In fact, Subutai&#x27;s family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai&#x27;s father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai&#x27;s elder brother Jelme also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from Jebe, then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca&#x27;urqan) is mentioned in the Secret History of the Mongols.

According to Subutai&#x27;s biography in the History of Yuan, Subutai&#x27;s father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai&#x27;s brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father&#x27;s difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor&#x27;s station.

Despite this close family association, some consider Subutai&#x27;s career proof that the Mongol Empire was a meritocracy. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a blacksmith. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin&#x27;s army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis. Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 tumens operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe&#x27;s death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his &quot;dogs of war,&quot; who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;:

Appointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan&#x27;s ger (yurt) door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to Genghis Khan, &quot;I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind.&quot; This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties. Throughout most of Genghis Khan&#x27;s lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite Jebe (1211–12, 1213–14, 1219–23) and Muqali (1213–14), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219).

Subutai&#x27;s first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the Merkit, when he was 22 years old. Subutai&#x27;s role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan&#x27;s offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals. He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia.

==As a general==
Subutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances. Subutai&#x27;s maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and destroyed the surrounding agriculture so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.

In contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the battle of Carrhae or the battle of Manzikert, Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the battle of the Kalka River in 1223, Subutai&#x27;s 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.

Subutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in siege warfare. Even in field battles he made use of siege engines. In the Battle of Mohi, the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge stonethrowers to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the creeping barrage of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.

Like Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity.

==Central Asian campaigns (1217–1220)==

In 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated Merkits and their allies, the Cuman-Kipchak confederation, in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the Chu River in 1217 and again in 1219 in Wild Kipchak territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children&#x27;s toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai&#x27;s army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture all of the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.

Mohammed II of Khwarizm attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan&#x27;s elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed&#x27;s confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark. Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the Kara-Khitai Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars.

Genghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade Khwarizm as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically superior to the forces of the Khwarizim Empire, and through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan&#x27;s army through the deadly Kyzylkum Desert to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara. After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammed attempted to save himself by fleeing into central Persia, but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan&#x27;s main army. Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the &#x27;Second Alexander&#x27;.

==The Great Raid (1220–1223)==

Subutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in Azerbaijan and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] &quot;which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated&quot;: 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the Caspian Sea through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild Kipchaks and Cumans.

After destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of Georgia. Though the king George IV of Georgia was reluctant to commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated the Georgian army despite the presence of many thousands of Georgian knights, by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men parade in front of crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.

This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the Fifth Crusade. Instead, King George&#x27;s sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope Honorius III to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated. Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer.

After ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the Caucasus Mountains during the winter to get around the Derbent Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a perilous route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the Alans, Circassians, and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. The plan worked, but strategic advantage came at a high price. In all likelihood the 1,000 men were led by Jebe who was killed by some Kipchaks. As expected the coalition army pursued the Mongols and after retreating for 9 days, Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined Rus&#x27; and Cuman army at the Kalka (31 May 1223). Arab historian Ibn al-Athir mentions a campaign against Volga Bulgaria, where the Mongol army was defeated in late 1223 or early 1224 (620). According to Ibn al-Athir, 4,000 men survived from the Mongol side in this battle. The remaining army proceeded to Desht-i Qipchaq, where they joined the army of Jochi, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.

==Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin China (1207, 1209, 1211–1215, 1226–27)==

In the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe&#x27;s army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming Great Wall). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic battle of Yehuling. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter&#x27;s daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.

Subutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of Xi Xia in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis&#x27;s main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the Jin districts along the upper Wei River, and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet. Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son Ögedei in 1229.

===Conquest of Jin China (1231–1235)===
After a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230–1231, Ögedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central China) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229, but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229–1230 after the Mongol general Doqolqu suffered a major defeat. Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them.

At the Battle of Daohuigu, Subutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai&#x27;s main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of Henan ended in failure after Subutai&#x27;s advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch’e-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.

In 1231–1232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and Tolui, invading the Song Empire and attacking Henan from the more exposed south. The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides. This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south.

The main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai&#x27;s army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force. Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin&#x27;s attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.

With part of his force harassing the Jin army&#x27;s foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin&#x27;s line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai&#x27;s army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army&#x27;s food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Sanfengshan, capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T’iehling (1 March 1232).

The heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of that had a perimeter stretching . Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called &quot;Thunder Crash Bombs&quot;, which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, mangonels, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their and extremely long resistance. However, Ögedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly. With assistance from the Song dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234.

However, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized Kaifeng and Luoyang during the summer of 1234 during Subutai&#x27;s absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them, and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position. Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai&#x27;s victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward.

==Conquest of Rus&#x27; (1236–1240)==

Ögedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the Wild Kipchaks and Bulgars. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince Batu). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: Ögedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died. In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains. After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader Bachman on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the &#x27;net&#x27;.

Unlike in 1222–23 when the majority of the Rus&#x27; states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Rus&#x27; were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked Ryazan and Vladimir-Suzdal, operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The Rus forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the Don River. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the Black Sea. In 1239, the Rus&#x27; state of Chernigov was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer Novgorod when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.

The most notable encounter of the campaign was the battle of the Sit River in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus&#x27; leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated. The Mongols had made a treaty with Galicia-Volhynia, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. Kiev, Vladimir, and other cities were quickly taken.

==Invasion of Central Europe (1241–1242)==
The attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of Jochi, was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against Kievan Rus&#x27;. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the Kingdom of Hungary, and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates.

Though the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, Bela IV, was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to. Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories Baidar and Kadan regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the Battle of Legnica, right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While Güyük&#x27;s army triumphed in Transylvania, a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King Bela IV had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai&#x27;s force still managed an astonishing pace of a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela&#x27;s obstacles.

Only one day after the smaller Mongol army in Poland had won the Battle of Legnica, Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the Battle of Mohi during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so catapults were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows. Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled.

The result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the Mongols left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai&#x27;s classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this &#x27;hole&#x27; in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men. In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong ba&#x27;aaturs (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.

===Mongol subjugation of Hungary===

In addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check during the Hungarian campaign. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preemptively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai. This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease. Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes Guyuk and Buri. Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai&#x27;s coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to Ögedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.

Despite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary. From Rogerius&#x27; writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy.

In order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at Oradea, the castle of St. Martin of Pannonia, and the capital Esztergom, though the latter&#x27;s stone citadel held out, and not all sieges proved successful.

By early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the Holy Roman Empire, when news came of the death of Ögedei Khan and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia. Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. This account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan&#x27;s death after they had already begun the withdrawal. However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary&#x27;s population may have died from the invasion. Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to Pope Innocent IV that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.

==Final years==
After subduing a Cuman revolt in what is now Russia, Subutai turned towards Mongolia. Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in the Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and Güyük was elected after three years, with Subutai&#x27;s support. Güyük had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals to be made unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge, at the age of 71, of the campaign against the Song dynasty for 1246–1247. The papal envoy Plano Carpini saw him when he was in Karakorum, Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called him a Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the remainder of his life at his home in the vicinity of the Tuul River (near modern Ulaanbaatar), dying there at the age of 72. A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the Danube river.

Subutai&#x27;s descendants such as Uriyangkhadai and Aju would serve the Great Khans for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of Dali, but not Dai Viet however. He later achieved great success invading Song China from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of Möngke Khan. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the battle of Xiangyang, which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279.

==Legacy==
In a unique historical anomaly, the strategic and operational innovations of Genghis Khan and Subutai became lost in history, and others were forced to rediscover them 600 and 700 years later. Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century. The Mongols did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3–5 axes of approach, often 500–1000 km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail. Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state&#x27;s will to fight. Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.

Though unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai&#x27;s exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book &quot;Great Captains Unveiled&quot; after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise. Due to his innovative battle tactics and novelty in strategy he is a source of inspiration for later generals. In particular, Erwin Rommel and George Patton were avid students of Mongol campaigns.

===&#x27;Deep Battle&#x27; theory===

Russia derived the most use out of a careful study of the Mongol campaigns. Their closer proximity to the steppe gave them greater interest and access to the Mongolian campaigns, first analyzed by the Russian General Mikhail Ivanin in the 19th century, which became a recommended text in the Russian military academies up until the mid 20th century. Ivanin&#x27;s work became used in the Deep Battle doctrine developed by Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Mikhail Frunze, and G. S. Isserson. Deep Battle doctrine bore a heavy resemblance to Mongol strategic methods, substituting tanks, motorized troop carriers, artillery, and airplanes for Mongol horse archers, lancers, and field artillery. The Red Army even went so far as to copy Subutai&#x27;s use of smokescreens on the battlefield to cover troop movements. Later in the 20th century, American military theorist John Boyd and some of his followers used Genghis Khan and Subutai&#x27;s campaigns as examples of maneuver warfare.

<text>Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli () is an Italian professional football club based in the city of Naples that plays in Serie A, the top flight of Italian football. In its history, Napoli has won three Serie A titles, six Coppa Italia titles, two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and one UEFA Cup.

The club was formed in 1926 as Associazione Calcio Napoli following the merger of US Internazionale Napoli and Naples Foot-Ball Club. Napoli saw relatively little success in its early years, winning their first major trophy in the 1962 Coppa Italia. Napoli then saw increased success in the late 1970s (including their second Coppa Italia in 1976) and especially in the 1980s, after the club acquired Diego Maradona in 1984. During his time in Naples, Maradona helped the team win several trophies, which led to the club retiring his number 10 jersey. During this period, Napoli won two league titles (in 1987 and 1990), the 1987 Coppa Italia, the 1990 Supercoppa Italiana, and their only European trophy with the 1989 UEFA Cup. Following his departure, however, Napoli struggled financially, and endured several relegations and a bankruptcy, prior to being re-founded in 2004 by film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis. Under his leadership, the club has stabilized, which has led to renewed on-field success, winning 2005–06 Serie C1, the 2012, 2014, and 2020 Coppa Italia titles, and the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana, eventually culminating in their third league title in 2023, the first since Maradona&#x27;s departure.

By attendance, Napoli have the fourth-largest fan base in Italy, and were ranked as the fifth highest-earning football club in Serie A, with $182 million in revenue during the 2017–18 season. In 2018, Forbes estimated the club is the fifth most valuable club in Italy, worth $379 million. Napoli are also one of the associate members of the European Club Association.

Since 1959, the club has played their home games at the Stadio San Paolo, which was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona after the Argentine striker&#x27;s death in 2020. Napoli traditionally wear sky blue shirts, white shorts, and sky blue socks at home and white shirts, white or sky blue shorts, and white or sky blue socks away; this is derived from the shirts of Naples FBC and the shorts of Internazionale Napoli after the clubs merged to form Napoli&#x27;s predecessor Internaples in 1922. Napoli have rivalries with Juventus, Roma, Internazionale and AC Milan. The club&#x27;s anthem is &quot;Napoli&quot;, one of the major hits of the Neapolitan singer Nino D&#x27;Angelo.

==History==
===Origins===

Although the club was officially founded in 1926, Napoli traces its roots to the first relevant Neapolitan club, founded as &quot;Naples Foot-Ball &amp; Croquet Club&quot; in 1905 by English sailor William Poths and his associate Hector M. Bayon. Neapolitans such as Conforti, Catterina and Amedeo Salsi were also involved; Salsi was named the club&#x27;s first president. The original kit of the club was a sky blue and navy blue striped shirt, with black shorts. Naples&#x27; first match was a 3–2 win against the English crew of the boat &quot;Arabik&quot; with goals from William MacPherson, Michele Scafoglio and Léon Chaudoir.

Early into its existence, the Italian Football Championship was limited to just northern clubs, so southern clubs competed against sailors or in cups such as Thomas Lipton&#x27;s Lipton Challenge Cup. In the cup competed between Naples FBC and Palermo FBC Naples won three finals. The foreign contingent at the club broke off in 1911 to form Internazionale Napoli, who wore blue shirts with white shorts, in time for both club&#x27;s debut in the Italian Championship of 1912–13. Each of the teams won a Prima Categoria southern Italian titles and therefore competed in the national semi-finals, Naples doing so in 1912–13 and Internazionale Napoli in 1913–14. They were set to face each other for the southern titles again in 1914–15 but it was cancelled due to World War I.

Due to financial pressure, the two rival clubs merged as the &quot;Foot-Ball Club Internazionale-Naples&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;FBC Internaples&quot; on 2 October 1922. Internaples&#x27;, and later Napoli&#x27;s kits are derived from those of Naples FBC and Internazionale Napoli; adopting the sky blue from Naples&#x27; shirts and the white shorts from Internazionale Napoli.

===FBC Internaples===
The merged club was seen by some media and fans to be a continuation of Internazionale Napoli rather than a new club; it played its games at Internazionale Napoli&#x27;s Terme di Agnano rather than Naples FBC&#x27;s Campo del Poligono and kept Internazionale Napoli&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Gli Azzurri&quot; (The Blues) rather than &quot;I Blucelesti&quot; (The Navy Blue and Sky Blues) used by Naples. Internaples were also given the nickname &quot;I Puledri&quot; (the foals), as the horse is a symbol of Naples.

Internaples were immediately enrolled in the top-flight Prima Divisione Lega Sud championship, as both Internazionale Napoli and Naples competed in that division pre-merger. Since the end of World War I both clubs had lost dominance of the region to the likes of Puteolana and Savoia. Even with the combined strength of Internaples, Savoia still proved to be the top team in southern Italy. Internaples reached the interregional semi-finals of Lega Sud in each of its first two seasons, and reached the Lega Sud finals in 1925–26. This secured the club a spot in the new Divisione Nazionale for the following season.

===The birth of Associazione Calcio Napoli===
Under the presidency of Giorgio Ascarelli, and likely under pressure from the new fascist government to &quot;Italianize&quot; the club, Internaples changed its name to Associazione Calcio Napoli on 25 August 1926. The newly renamed team also moved from the Terme di Agnano to a new stadium, the Stadio Militare dell&#x27;Arenaccia. After a poor start, with a sole point in an entire championship, Napoli was re-admitted to Serie A&#x27;s forerunner, the Divisione Nazionale, by the Italian Football Federation (&quot;FIGC&quot;), and began to improve thanks in part to Paraguayan-born Attila Sallustro, who was the first fully fledged hero to the fans. He was a capable goal-scorer and eventually set the all-time goal-scoring record for Napoli, which was later surpassed by players like Diego Maradona and Marek Hamšík.

Napoli entered the Serie A era under the management of William Garbutt. During Garbutt&#x27;s six-year stint, the club would be dramatically transformed, frequently finishing in the top half of the table. This included two third-place finishes during the 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons, with added notables such as Antonio Vojak, Arnaldo Sentimenti and Carlo Buscaglia. However, in the years leading up to World War II, Napoli went into decline, only surviving relegation in 1939–40 by goal average.

Napoli lost a closely contested relegation battle at the end of 1942 and were relegated to Serie B. They moved from the Stadio Giorgio Ascarelli to the Stadio Arturo Collana and remained in Serie B until after the war.

===Post-war era and first trophies===
Play restarted in 1945 with two divisions: one consisting of Serie A teams from the north and one combined division of Serie A and Serie B teams from the central and south, with the top four of each division advancing to the national round that followed. Napoli won the Centro-Sud Serie A-B to secure a place in the Divisione Nazionale (where they placed fifth) and automatic promotion to the next season&#x27;s Serie A. They were relegated after two seasons for a bribery scandal. The club won the Serie B titles that season to ensure top flight football at the start of the 1950s. Napoli moved to their new home ground Stadio San Paolo in 1959.

Despite erratic league form with highs and lows during this period, including multiple relegations and promotions, Napoli won their first major trophy when they beat SPAL to lift the Coppa Italia in 1962, with goals from Gianni Corelli and Pierluigi Ronzon. The victory made Napoli the first team to win the Coppa while in Serie B, and they were promoted to Serie A that season. Their fourth relegation cut celebrations short the following season.

===Name change===
As the club changed their name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli on 25 June 1964 they began to rise up again, gaining promotion in 1964–65. Under the management of former player Bruno Pesaola, they won the Coppa delle Alpi and were back among the elite in Serie A, with consistent top-five finishes. Napoli came very close to winning the league in 1967–68, finishing just behind Milan in second place. Some of the most popular players from this period were Dino Zoff, José Altafini, Omar Sívori and hometown midfielder Antonio Juliano. Juliano would eventually break the appearance records, which still stands today.

===League stability and second Coppa Italia===

The trend of Napoli performing well in the league continued into the 1970s, with third place spots in 1970–71 and 1973–74. Under the coaching of former player Luís Vinício, this gained them entry into the early UEFA Cup competitions. In 1974–75, they reached the third round knocking out Porto 2–0 &quot;en route&quot;. During the same season, Napoli finished second in Serie A, just two points behind champions Juventus. Solid performances from locally born players such as Giuseppe Bruscolotti, Antonio Juliano and Salvatore Esposito were relied upon during this period, coupled with goals from Giuseppe Savoldi.

The club won their second Coppa Italia trophy in 1975–76, eliminating Milan and Fiorentina &quot;en route&quot;, before beating rivals Hellas Verona 4–0 in the finals. That season, they also defeated Southampton 4–1 on aggregate to lift the 1976 Anglo-Italian League Cup. Napoli were entered into the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup for 1976–77, where they reached the semi-finals, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Anderlecht. In the Italian league, Napoli were still very much a consistent top six side for much of the late 1970s. Even into the earliest two seasons of the 1980s, the club were performing respectably with a third-place finish in 1980–81. Napoli&#x27;s Primavera squad was also doing well at the time, winning the Torneo di Viareggio Cup in 1975 and their only Campionato Nazionale Primavera title in 1979. However, by 1983, they had slipped dramatically and were involved in relegation battles.

===Napoli on the rise: Maradona era===
Napoli broke the world transfer record fee after acquiring Diego Maradona in a €12 million deal from Barcelona on 30 June 1984. The squad was gradually re-built, with the likes of Ciro Ferrara, Salvatore Bagni and Fernando De Napoli filling the ranks. The rise up the tables was gradual, by 1985–86, they had a third-place finish under their belts, but better was yet to come. With the attacking trio of Maradona, Bruno Giordano, and Careca (nicknamed MaGiCa), the 1986–87 season was the landmark in Napoli&#x27;s history, becoming just the third Italian team to win the double after securing the Serie A title by three points and then beating Atalanta BC 4–0 to lift the Coppa Italia.

Because a mainland Southern Italian team had never won the league before, this turned Maradona into a cultural, social and borderline religious icon for Neapolitans, which stretched beyond the realms of just football.

The club were unsuccessful in the European Cup in the following season and finished runners-up in Serie A. However, Napoli were entered into the UEFA Cup for 1988–89 and won their first major European titles. Juventus, Bayern Munich and PAOK were defeated &quot;en route&quot; to the final, where Napoli beat VfB Stuttgart 5–4 on aggregate, with two goals from Careca and one each from Maradona, Ferrara and Alemão.

Napoli added their second Serie A titles in 1989–90, defeating Milan by two points in the titles race. However, this was surrounded by less auspicious circumstances as Napoli were awarded two points for a game, when in Bergamo, an Atalanta fan threw a 100 lira coin at Alemão&#x27;s head.

A controversial set of events set off at the 1990 World Cup, when Maradona made comments pertaining to North–South inequality in the country and the &quot;risorgimento&quot;, asking Neapolitans to root for Argentina in the semi-finals against Italy in Naples.

The Stadio San Paolo was the only stadium during the competition where the Argentine national anthem was not jeered, Maradona bowed to the Napoli fans at the end and his country went on to reach the finals. However, after the finals, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) forced Maradona to take a doping test, which he failed testing positive for cocaine; both Maradona and Napoli staff later claimed it was a revenge plot for events at the World Cup. Maradona was banned for 15 months and would never play for the club again. The club still won the Supercoppa Italiana that year, with a record 5–1 victory against Juventus, but it would be their last major trophy for 22 years. In the European Cup, they were eliminated in the second round.

===Decline===
Though the club finished fourth during the 1991–92 season, Napoli gradually went into decline after that season, both financially and on the field. Players such as Gianfranco Zola, Daniel Fonseca, Ciro Ferrara and Careca had all departed by 1994. Nonetheless, Napoli qualified for the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, reaching the third round and in 1996–97, Napoli appeared at the Coppa Italia finals, but lost 3–1 to Vicenza; Napoli&#x27;s primavera squad won the Coppa Italia Primavera that season. Napoli&#x27;s league form had dropped lower, and relegation to Serie B came at the end of 1997–98 when they won only two matches all season.

The club returned to Serie A after gaining promotion in the 1999–2000 season, though after a closely contested relegation battle, they were relegated immediately back down the following season. By August 2004, Napoli was declared bankrupt. To secure football in the city, film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis re-founded the club under the name Napoli Soccer, as they were not allowed to use their old name until the next season. FIGC placed Napoli in Serie C1, where they missed out on promotion after losing 2–1 in play-offs to local rivals Avellino in 2004–05.

Despite the fact Napoli were playing in a low division, they retained higher average attendances than most of the Serie A clubs, breaking the Serie C attendance record with 51,000 at one match.

===Resurgence===
The following season, they secured promotion to Serie B and De Laurentiis brought back the club&#x27;s history, restoring its name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli in May 2006. After just one season in Serie B, they were promoted to the top division, along with Juventus and other fellow &quot;sleeping giants&quot; Genoa. In 2010, under manager Walter Mazzarri, Napoli finished in sixth place to qualify for a 2010–11 UEFA Europa League spot. Napoli finished third in the 2010–11 season, qualifying directly for the group stage of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League.

In the 2011–12 season, Napoli ended in fifth place in Serie A, but defeated unbeaten champions Juventus at the Stadio Olimpico to win the Coppa Italia for the fourth time in the club&#x27;s history, 25 years after their last cup win. The team finished second in its group of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, progressing to the round of 16, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Chelsea. In 2012–13, Napoli finished in second place in Serie A, the club&#x27;s best performance since winning the 1989–90 Scudetto. Edinson Cavani finished as top scorer in the division with 29 goals, which resulted in him being sold to Paris Saint-Germain for a club-record fee of €64 million.

In the 2013 close-season, Mazzarri left Napoli and Rafael Benítez became the club&#x27;s manager. They finished the 2013–14 season by winning the 2014 Coppa Italia finals, their fifth title in the tournament, with a 3–1 win against Fiorentina, as well as qualifying for the Champions League, but missed out on the group stage as they lost to Athletic Bilbao in the play-off round. Their subsequent run in the Europa League ended when they lost 2–1 on aggregate to Dnipro in the semi-finals. They finished the 2014–15 season in fifth, with Benítez then leaving for Real Madrid and being replaced by Maurizio Sarri.

In Sarri&#x27;s first season in charge in the 2015–16 season, Napoli finished in second place with 82 points, and were knocked out of the Europa League in the round of 32 against Villarreal. In the following season, Napoli finished in 3rd place on 86 points and were knocked out of the Champions League in the round of 16 against Real Madrid. This year saw the breakout season for Dries Mertens who scored 34 goals in all competitions after he was moved from the left-wing to centre-forward following Milik&#x27;s torn Anterior cruciate ligament.

In the 2017–18 season, Napoli challenged for the titles for the entire season, and finished with a club record of 91 points. However, the titles ultimately went to Juventus in the penultimate round of matches. On 23 December 2017, Marek Hamšík overtook Diego Maradona as Napoli&#x27;s all-time leading scorer after scoring his 115th goal. At the end of the season, Sarri left for Chelsea, succeeded by Carlo Ancelotti in May 2018. He managed the club to another second-place finish, but was sacked on 10 December 2019, following a poor run of results in the 2019–20 season which left them seventh in the table. Gennaro Gattuso was named head coach the next day. On 14 June 2020, Dries Mertens became Napoli&#x27;s all-time top scorer after scoring his 122nd goal in a Coppa Italia semi-finals match against Inter. Napoli went on to win the 2019–20 Coppa Italia in a penalty shoot-out against Juventus in the finals.

In December 2020, Napoli renamed San Paolo after club icon Diego Maradona, following his passing. Napoli finished fifth in Serie A that season after a draw on the finals day, missing a Champions League berth by one point.

In the 2021–22 season, Luciano Spalletti replaced Gennaro Gattuso as head coach and led the team to the third place in Serie A, securing a Champions League spot for the azzurri after a two-years absence.

In the 2022–23 season, Napoli clinched the Serie A titles for the first time since the 1989–90 season, and their third title overall, following a 1–1 draw against Udinese on 4 May 2023, their first time as titleholders since the days of Diego Maradona. Meanwhile, in the Champions League, Spalletti led them to the quarter-finals for the first time in their European history, where they were beaten 2–1 (1–0 away and 1–1 at home) by fellow Serie A side Milan.

The 2023–24 season proved to be extremely difficult for the club, as they went through three different coaches - Rudi Garcia, a returning Walter Mazzarri, and Francesco Calzona; this managerial instability, as well as the new hires largely not performing to the club&#x27;s expectations, led the Azzurri to finish 10th in the league, 50 points behind eventual champions Inter. In Europe, the club passed the group stage of the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League in a group with Real Madrid, 1. FC Union Berlin, and SC Braga, but were ultimately eliminated by FC Barcelona in the round of 16.

For the 2024–25 season, the club signed Antonio Conte in a bid for a swift return to winning ways. Their season started out with a 3–0 away loss against Hellas Verona, but the Azzurri quickly bounced back with 5 wins and one draw in the following six matches.

===Retired numbers===

In the summer of 2000, Napoli retired the jersey number 10 belonged to former club legend Diego Maradona, who played for the club from 1984 to 1991. Since the adoption of persistent squad numbers with players names printed on the jersey, the last players to wear the number 10 were Fausto Pizzi (in 1995–1996), Beto (in 1996–1997), Igor Protti (in 1997–1998) who was the last player to play and score a goal with the number 10 shirt in Serie A and Claudio Bellucci (from 1998 to 2000 in Serie B). 

However, for regulatory reasons, the number was reissued from 2004 to 2006 in Serie C1, as at the time Italy’s third level tournament still used the old numbering from 1 to 11, without printed names. The last player to wear and score goals with this shirt in an official match was Mariano Bogliacino in the home match of 18 May 2006 against Spezia, valid for the finals leg of the Supercoppa di Lega Serie C1; primacy belongs to him also for last appearance in the championship, 12 May 2006 at the home match against Lanciano. As regards exclusively the championship, however, the honour goes to the Argentine footballer Roberto Sosa, the distinction of being the last to wear the 10 at the San Paolo and at the same time to score in the match against Frosinone on 30 April 2006.

==Culture==
===Colours, badge and nicknames===
As Naples is a coastal city, the colours of the club have always been derived from the blue waters of the Gulf of Naples. Originally, while using the name &quot;Naples FBC&quot;, the colours of the club implemented two shades of blue. However, since the 1920s, a singular blue tone has been used in the form of azure. Thus, Napoli share the nickname &quot;&quot;Azzurri&quot; with the Italy national team. The shade of blue has been sky blue in many instances.

Napoli typically wear azure shirts with white shorts at home and white shirts with either white or blue shorts away, though in recent years the away kits have often deviated from this tradition.

One of the nicknames of Napoli is &quot;I ciucci&quot;&quot;, which means &quot;the donkeys&quot; in the Neapolitan language. Napoli were given this name after a particularly poor performance during the 1926–27 season. It was originally meant to be derogatory, as the Neapolitan symbol is a rampant black horse, but the club adopted the donkey as a mascot named &quot;&quot;&#x27;O Ciuccio&quot;&quot;.

Napoli&#x27;s first badge featured a rampant horse on top of a football with the letters &quot;ACN&quot; around it. The current club badge features a large &quot;N&quot; placed within a circle. This crest can be traced back to Internazionale Napoli, which used a similar design on their shirts. Since the club officially adopted the &quot;N badge&quot; as its representative, Napoli have altered it slightly at various times; sometimes it features the club&#x27;s name around it, sometimes it does not. The main difference between each badge is the shade of blue used. Usually the &quot;N&quot; is white, although it has occasionally been gold (especially prior to 1980).

&quot;Partenopei&quot; is a popular nickname for the club and people from the city of Naples in general. It is derived from Greek mythology where the siren Parthenope tried to enchant Odysseus from his ship to Capri. In the story, Odysseus had his men tie him to the ship&#x27;s mast so he was able to resist the song of the siren. Consequently, Parthenope, unable to live with the rejection of her love, drowned herself and her body was washed up upon the shore of Naples.

==Supporters and rivalries==
===Support===

Napoli is the fourth most supported football club in Italy with around 13% of Italian football fans supporting the club. Like other top clubs in the country, Napoli&#x27;s fanbase goes beyond the Italian border; in 2018, the society announced that the team had over 35 million supporters worldwide and 120 million people who liked to watch Napoli matches.

The main ultra groups of Napoli are &quot;Fedayn EAM 1979&quot;, &quot;Ultras Napoli&quot;, &quot;Fossato Flegreo&quot;, &quot;Secco Vive&quot;, &quot;Mastiffs&quot;, &quot;Brigata Carolina&quot;, &quot;Teste Matte&quot;, &quot;Sud1996&quot;, &quot;Nuova Guardia&quot;, &quot;Vecchi Lions&quot; and &quot;Masseria&quot;.

Napoli fans have occasionally cheered loud enough to register as earthquakes on seismographs at University of Naples Federico II.

===Rivalries===
Unlike other Italian cities such as Genoa, Milan, Rome and Turin, Napoli is the only major football club in the city, and therefore there is no derby in the strict sense of the term. The now-infrequent derby with Savoia, the next largest club in Naples, was played for the first time 24 December 1939, during the knockout phase of the 1939–40 Coppa Italia, the score was 1–3 in favor of Napoli. The last meeting between the clubs was in Serie B in 2000, won 0–1 by Napoli.

Napoli&#x27;s most hated rivals are Roma, known as the Derby del Sole (Derby of the Sun), and the principal northern team Juventus. As Napoli is one of the most important southern Italian teams, there are a lot of rivalries with several northern teams, like Milan, Internazionale, Atalanta BC and Hellas Verona They also have a rivalry with the other Roman club Lazio, and contest the Derby Mezzogiorno (Midday Derby/Derby of Southern Italy) against Bari and Derby Bourbon (referencing the family that ruled the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) against Foggia.

The Derby del Sud Italia (Derby of Southern Italy) against Catanzaro was considered one of the most important rivalries in Italy during the 1970s.

The fans of Napoli do co-star in two particular derbies in Italy against other regional teams: Derby della Campania generally refers to a rivalry with regional clubs, mainly Avellino and Salernitana.

===Friendships===
A &quot;friendly rivalry&quot; with Palermo is contested, known as the Derby delle Due Sicilie (Derby of the Two Sicilies), in reference to the historical link of the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies. Another friendly rivalry exists with Catania known as the Derby del Vulcano (Volcano Derby), referencing Mount Vesuvius near Naples and Mount Etna near Catania.

Friendships with teams outside Italy exist Borussia Dortmund, Celtic, and Lokomotiv Plovdiv, among others. And they have good relations with Delije Sever, Red Star fans. Napoli ultras helped Delije steal flags from Roma fans and beat them up together.

Napoli formerly had a famous and long-standing friendship with the fans of Genoa, but the friendship ended in 2019. Napoli also once had a friendship with Roma.

==Finances==
S.S.C. Napoli was expelled from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the &quot;new&quot; Napoli) in the same year, while the corporate entity which administered the &quot;old&quot; Napoli was liquidated. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of amortization after Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and Prime Minister of Italy, introduced Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B.

Since re-foundation in 2004, the club&#x27;s large numbers of supporters provided the main source of income, particularly through gate revenues and TV rights. Napoli made an aggregate profit in 2006–07 Serie B. They have continued to be profitable since returning to Serie A. Napoli equity in 2005 was a negative €261,466, having started from €3 million capital. By 2010 the equity was at €25,107,223 and Napoli achieved self-sustainability.

<doc id="1130627" wikidata="Q2014564" url="?curid=1130627" title="Hyaline cartilage">
<text>Hyaline cartilage is the glass-like (hyaline) and translucent cartilage found on many joint surfaces. It is also most commonly found in the ribs, nose, larynx, and trachea. Hyaline cartilage is pearl-gray in color, with a firm consistency and has a considerable amount of collagen. It contains no nerves or blood vessels, and its structure is relatively simple.

==Structure==
Hyaline cartilage is the most common kind of cartilage in the human body. It is primarily composed of type II collagen and proteoglycans. Hyaline cartilage is located in the trachea, nose, epiphyseal plate, sternum, and ribs.

Hyaline cartilage is covered externally by a fibrous membrane known as the perichondrium. The primary cells of cartilage are chondrocytes, which are in a matrix of fibrous tissue, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. 

As cartilage does not have lymph glands or blood vessels, the movements of solutes, including nutrients, occur via diffusion within the fluid compartments contiguous with adjacent tissues. Cartilage gives the structures a definite but pliable form, making them strong, but with limited mobility and flexibility. Cartilage has no nerves.

Hyaline cartilage also forms the temporary embryonic skeleton, which is gradually replaced by bone, and the skeleton of elasmobranch fish.

===Microanatomy===
When a slice of hyaline cartilage is examined under the microscope, it is shown to consist of chondrocytes of a rounded or bluntly angular form, lying in groups of two or more in a granular, or almost homogeneous matrix. When arranged in groups of two or more, the chondrocytes have rounded, but generally straight outlines, where they are in contact with each other, and in the rest of their circumference, they are rounded.

They consist of translucent protoplasm with fine interlacing filaments and minute granules are sometimes present. Embedded in this are one or two round nuclei, having the usual intranuclear network.

The cells are contained in cavities in the matrix, called cartilage lacunae. These cavities are actually artificial gaps formed from the shrinking of the cells during the staining and setting of the tissue for examination. The inter-territorial space between the isogenous cell groups contains relatively more collagen fibers, allowing it to maintain its shape while the actual cells shrink, creating the lacunae. This constitutes the so-called &#x27;capsule&#x27; of the space. Each lacuna is usually occupied by a single cell, but during mitosis, it may contain two, four, or even eight cells.

===Articular cartilage===

Articular cartilage is hyaline cartilage on the surfaces of bones, and lies inside the joint cavity of synovial joints, bathed in synovial fluid produced by the synovial membrane, which lines the walls of the cavity.

Though it is often found in close contact with menisci and articular disks, articular cartilage is not considered a part of either of these structures, which are made entirely of fibrocartilage.

The articular cartilage extracellular matrix has a highly specialized architecture that is zonally organized: the superficial zone consists mostly of type II collagen fibers aligned parallel to the articular surface to resist shear forces, whereas the deep zone consists of the same fibers aligned perpendicularly to the bone interface to absorb compressive loads.

The biochemical breakdown of the articular cartilage results in osteoarthritis – the most common type of joint disease. Osteoarthritis affects over 30 million individuals in the United States alone, and is the leading cause of chronic disability amongst the elderly.

Articular cartilage development begins with interzone condensation of a type II collagen positive limb bud at the future joint site. This is followed by definition of specific cellular subtypes (meniscal progenitors, articular progenitors, synovial progenitors, and ligament progenitors) that will eventually form the joint capsule. Finally, the joint capsule matures and forms a cavity, with a central meniscus, and an encasement of synovium. This final structure will form several distinct layers of the articular cartilage found in all synovial joints including the deep zone (closest to the bone), middle zone, and superficial zone (closest to the synovial fluid).

Maintenance of articular cartilage is guided by a balance of anabolic (cartilage generating) and catabolic (cartilage degrading factors), in a manner similar to the maintenance of bone. Over the lifetime of the organism, anabolic factors and catabolic factors are generally in balance, however, as the organism ages, catabolism predominates and cartilage begins to degrade. Eventually, the loss of hyaline cartilage matrix and reduction in the chondrocyte content of the hyaline cartilage matrix results in the development of joint disease such as osteoarthritis. Overexpression of hyaline-cartilage specific anabolic factors, such as FGF18, appears to restore the balance between cartilage loss and generation.

<doc id="1130631" wikidata="Q388354" url="?curid=1130631" title="Barroso Commission">
<text>The Barroso Commission was the European Commission in office from 22 November 2004 until 31 October 2014. Its president was José Durão Barroso, who presided over 27 other commissioners (one from each of the states composing the European Union, aside from Portugal, which is Barroso&#x27;s state). On 16 September 2009 Barroso was re-elected by the European Parliament for a further five years and his Commission was approved to take office on 9 February 2010.

Barroso was at first seen as the lowest common denominator by outside commentators, but his proposed team of Commissioners earned him some respect before triggering a crisis when the European Parliament objected to some of them, forcing a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission gained two new members when Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union.

Barroso&#x27;s handling of his office was markedly more presidential than his predecessors. During his term the Commission passed major legislation including the REACH and &#x27;Bolkestein&#x27; Directives. Under Barroso, the civil service in the Commission became more economically liberal.

==History==
Barroso was nominated as president and approved by Parliament in July 2004. However his proposed Commission met with opposition from the Parliament, notably concerning Rocco Buttiglione and his conservative comments which were seen as incompatible with his role as European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security. The opposition plunged the EU into a minor crisis before Barroso conceded to the Parliament and reshuffled his team, removing Buttiglione, and his Commission took office on 22 November 2004. The commission was joined in 2007 by two further Commissioners when Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU.

===Presidential candidates===
The Prodi Commission was due to end its mandate at the end of October 2004, so following the 2004 elections to the Sixth European Parliament, candidates for Commission President began to be considered. There was strong backing for Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt (EDLR) from Ireland, France and Germany who saw him as a &quot;convinced European and also a fighter&quot;. However the federalist was opposed by Spain the United Kingdom, Italy and Poland due to his vocal opposition to both the Iraq War and the inclusion of God in the European Constitution. Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern (AEN) was also a popular candidate but did not wish to take up the job.

Due to the victory of the European People&#x27;s Party in the previous election, EPP parties were keen to get one of their members into the post, including Luxembourgian Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker (EPP), who refused, and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel (EPP), who was in a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party of Austria which discredited him as a candidate to some governments.

A number of Commissioners were also touted, notably Franz Fischler, Commissioner for Agriculture (Austria, EPP), António Vitorino, Commissioner for JHA (Portugal, PES), Chris Patten, Commissioner for External Relations (UK, ED), Michel Barnier, and Commissioner for Regional Policy (France, EPP).

Other candidates were High Representative Javier Solana (Spain, PES) and President of the Parliament Pat Cox (Ireland, ELDR) however both were light candidates. However Barroso emerged as a leading candidate despite his support for the Iraq War and being seen as the lowest common denominator following objections to other candidates. The Parliament approved Barroso as president on 22 July 2004 by 413 votes to 215 (44 abstentions) with most of his support coming from the EPP-ED group. He did however earn praise for his later choice of commissioners.

===Commissioner hearings===
Barroso rejected the idea of a &quot;supercommissioner&quot; and desired 1/3 of the commission to be women and that the most powerful portfolios should be handed to those most capable, not those from larger states. His sharing out of jobs between the larger and smaller states equally earned him some early praise. Candidates were proposed by national governments for each of the Commissioners and Parliament held hearings for them, to determine their suitability, between 27 September and 11 October of that year.

During the hearings, members found fault in a number of Commissioners. Committees questioned the suitability of Ingrida Udre (Taxation and Customs Union), László Kovács (Energy), Neelie Kroes (Competition) and Mariann Fischer-Boel (Agriculture). However the most controversial was Rocco Buttiglione as European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security due to his conservative comments (on women&#x27;s position in marriage and that homosexuality was a sin) which, in the eyes of some MEPs, made him unsuitable for a job securing civil rights in the EU leading to the civil rights committee to be the first committee to vote down an incoming Commissioner.

The Party of European Socialists (PES) were the most vocal critics of Barroso and his proposed Commission, while the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) backed the commission with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) split. Barroso attempted to offer small concessions to Parliament but they were not accepted as the PES made clear they would vote down the commission as it stood, leaving the divided ALDE holding the balance of whether the Barroso Commission would be the first Commission in EU history to rejected by Parliament. The EPP demanded that if Buttiglione were to go, then a PES commissioner must also be sacrificed for balance.

Barroso eventually gave in and withdrew his proposed college of Commissioners and, following three weeks which left Prodi continuing as a caretaker, proposed a new line-up. There were three changes to help his dented authority and win the support of Parliament: Buttiglione had been withdrawn by Italy and replaced by foreign minister Franco Frattini, László Kovács was moved from Energy to Taxation and Ingrida Udre was withdrawn and replaced by Andris Piebalgs who took over the now vacant post of Energy.

However a further issue concerning Jacques Barrot was raised by Independence/Democracy co-leader Nigel Farage MEP. Barrot, a returning Commissioner nominated as a Vice-President with the Transport portfolio, had received a suspended prison sentence in 2000 in relation to a funding scandal involving his political party. He subsequently received a Presidential amnesty from then-French President Jacques Chirac and Barroso was unaware of the conviction until it was raised by Parliament. Despite this, Barroso stood by Barrot stating he was fit for office. Farage had also made allegations against vice-president Siim Kallas, stating he had a criminal record in fraud. However this proved false, based on an inaccurate newspaper article, and an apology was published.

Despite this, the commission was approved on 18 November 2004, 449 votes in favour, 149 against and 82 abstentions, after Barroso gained the support of all three major parties and they took office on 22 November, three weeks after they were due to.

===2007 enlargement===
Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU on 1 January 2007 with each being granted a single Commissioner, increasing the college of Commissioners to 27 members. Both new Commissioners were approved by the Parliament on 12 December 2006. Meglena Kuneva was proposed by Bulgaria and was assigned the Consumer Protection portfolio, previously part of the joint Health &amp; Consumer Protection portfolio. She was welcomed by Parliament with the EPP and PES being impressed by her aims and attitude. Kuneva with 583 votes &quot;in favour&quot;, 21 votes &quot;against&quot; and 28 votes &quot;abstentions&quot;.

Romania originally proposed Senator Varujan Vosganian, however he quickly met with opposition from Socialists and the Commission itself due to his far right views and having no experience of the EU or profile outside Romania. That nomination was replaced by Leonard Orban who was given the portfolio of Multilingualism, previously part of Education, Training &amp; Culture. This however was met a cool reception for being such a slim portfolio. PES Group leader Martin Schulz MEP suggested it should instead focus on ethnic minorities but this was rejected by Barroso. Orban was approved by Parliament with 595 votes in favour, 16 against and 29 abstentions.

===End of term resignations===
In March 2008, Commissioner Kyprianou left the Commission following presidential elections in Cyprus to become his home country&#x27;s new foreign minister. He was replaced by Androula Vassiliou who was approved by Parliament on 9 April. Commissioners leaving early towards the end of their mandate is common, as they seek to secure their next job, but can undermine the commission as a whole.

Kyprianou was followed by Franco Frattini on 23 April 2008 following elections in Italy when he was recalled to serve as foreign minister of Italy. Frattini&#x27;s responsibilities were handed to Barrot (who held them in addition to his existing transport duties) until a replacement for Frattini could be found. In light of Parliament&#x27;s opposition in 2004 when Buttiglione was deemed inappropriate for the justice portfolio, when Antonio Tajani MEP (another right wing candidate) was put forward to replace Frattini, president Barroso handed him Barrot&#x27;s transport portfolio, leaving Barrot to continue with the justice portfolio for continuity and to ensure Parliament would back Tajani in such as non-sensitive position as Transport (but one still of interest to Italy due to problems with Alitalia). Parliament approved Tajani on 18 June 2008 with a vote of 507 to 53 (64 abstentions). Peter Mandelson then left in October 2008 to return to national politics as Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, being replaced by Baroness Ashton. Following the 2009 election two commissioners stood down to accept seats in the European Parliament: Danuta Hübner (Poland) and Louis Michel (Belgium) who were replaced by Paweł Samecki (4 July) and Karel De Gucht (17 July) respectively. Dalia Grybauskaitė (Lithuania) was replaced by Algirdas Šemeta on 1 July 2009) after becoming President of Lithuania. Ján Figeľ (Slovakia) was replaced by Maroš Šefčovič on 1 October 2009 after being elected leader of the Christian Democratic Movement on 21 September 2009.

===Second term – Barroso===
In 2008, Barroso steadily won support from leaders for a second term as president, Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi both declared their support for Barroso, though Barroso himself stated it is up to the political parties in Parliament. On 19 July 2008 Barroso stated for the first time that he was seeking a second term and was backed by the EPP for re-election. In the 2009 elections, the EPP maintained their position as largest party, though without an absolute majority even with the support of other parties to their right. Yet the second and third largest groups, the PES and ALDE, failed to put forward an alternative candidate to challenge Barroso even if they had won. Despite this, a loose red-green-yellow coalition (the PES/S&amp;D and ALDE with The Greens–European Free Alliance) formed against Barroso in an attempt to gain concessions from him. They demanded Barroso set out clearly his policy guidelines for his next term and offer key posts in the commission to their group members. They also attempted to push the vote back beyond the ratification date for the Treaty of Lisbon to have more power over his appointment.

In a meeting with the political groups on 10 September 2009, Barroso argued his new policies to a packed room with an unusually lively debate as Barroso defended his record against the Greens, his most ardent opponents. Despite holding his own in the debate he did not win support from the Greens. however the PES/S&amp;D and ALDE leaders softened their opposition, the latter approving of the idea of a Commissioner for Human Rights. Following the plenary debate on 15 September the EPP and anti-federalist European Conservatives and Reformists declared support, with conditional support from ALDE. The PES/S&amp;D, Greens/EFA and eurosceptic Europe for Freedom and Democracy group all declared opposition, criticising ALDE for switching camps. However the groups struggled to enforce a party line as MEPs vote via a secret ballot. The vote took place on 16 September 2009. On 16 September 2009, Barroso was re-elected by Parliament by 382 to 219 (out of 718, with 117 abstentions).

===Second term – College===
Although Jacques Barrot wished to stay, French President Sarkozy favoured Michel Barnier and Vladimír Špidla was also interested but his party is out of government. Benita Ferrero-Waldner lacks support in Austria and was replaced Communications Commissioner Margot Wallström did not intended to return for another third term and has criticised her portfolio for not having any powers. She recommended that her successor be a &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Commissioner&quot; with a legislative agenda, including control over Erasmus. To gain the liberal vote in Parliament Barroso pledged to create a Commissioner for Civil Liberties and a Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration (who will forge a common migration policy), splitting the current Justice, Freedom and Security portfolio.

The new portfolios, as well as splitting home affairs from civil liberties, merges enlargement with the neighbourhood policy, creates a post for climate change and scraps or merges weak dossiers such as communication (which was also open to charges of propaganda) and multilingualism. There are still some weak posts however, such as humanitarian aid and institutional relations.

There was some minor controversy over appointing a Frenchman to the Internal Market due to France&#x27;s desire to regulate the City of London, however the civil service department for such regulation will not be headed by a Briton. There was also concern over a Romanian taking on agriculture, as Romania has had problems managing its EU farm subsidies. Although Barroso had wished for greater gender balance, only one extra woman was nominated to the new Commission. All the vice-presidents are returning Commissioners and their order of precedence is: Catherine Ashton (first vice-president), Viviane Reding, Joaquin Almunia, Siim Kallas, Neelie Kroes, Antonio Tajani and then Maroš Šefčovič.

Bulgaria&#x27;s initial candidate, Rumiana Jeleva, was forced to step down due to opposition from MEPs, mainly the PES, who questioned her suitability and financial interests despite backing from the EPP (to which her national party belongs). Bulgaria rapidly submitted Kristalina Georgieva, but this forced the vote on the commission to be delayed weeks so Georgieva&#x27;s hearings could be arranged. The only other commissioner-designate to lack support was returning commissioner Neelie Kroes, who was also seen to perform poorly in her hearing. However, she was invited back and secured more support, indicating she will get approval from Parliament.

Parliament approved the new line-up on 9 February 2010 with 488 votes in favour. 137, The Greens–European Free Alliance and European United Left–Nordic Green Left, voted against while 72 MEPs abstained; including the European Conservatives and Reformists who abstained on democracy grounds. The greens criticised the other parties for opposing Barroso&#x27;s team and then voting in favour anyway, protesting that Barroso &quot;assigned portfolios without respect to the prospective commissioners&#x27; competences. Worse still, he moved commissioners from posts where they were doing a good job. The new college risks being characterised by internal power struggles instead of teamwork due to the unclear division of responsibilities.&quot; while the conservatives desired a vote for them individually as &quot;there were strong candidates who we would have endorsed, and weak candidates who we would have opposed.&quot;

However, in exchange for approving the commission, Parliament secured an agreement from Barroso ensuring Parliament&#x27;s president may attend the Commission meetings and international negotiations. However Barroso resisted Parliament&#x27;s calls for &quot;de facto&quot; legislative initiative for Parliament and for a veto power over special representatives.

==Legislation and actions==

There have been a number of high-profile pieces of legislation, inherited from Prodi and initiated by the President Commission. In most cases Barroso has been keep to connect himself to them rather than leave it to individual commissioners. The commission&#x27;s work includes the opening up of the EU&#x27;s services sector with the &#x27;Bolkestein&#x27; Directive and the largest piece of legislation thus far, the REACH directive. Through its work in getting agreement on such legislation, it has regained some respect as a neutral player previously lost in fighting with member states.

===Services===
One legislative package inherited from the Prodi Commission was the Directive on services in the internal market, commonly known as the &#x27;Bolkestein Directive&#x27;, which sought to liberalise the EU&#x27;s services sector which accounts for two-thirds of the EU&#x27;s economy. Barroso&#x27;s Market Commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, put forward a text following far reaching amendments proposed by Parliament and protests from trade unions.

An agreement was finally reached in May 2007 which excluded sectors such as social care, healthcare, gambling, port services, television media and security services among others. McCreevy also dropped the proposed country of origin principle where a company could operate in another EU country under their home state&#x27;s labour rules.

===Roaming===
One piece of legislation notably managed to win widespread public support, the Regulation on roaming charges in the European Union from Information Society &amp; Media Commissioner Viviane Reding. The legislation capped roaming charges for calls made from a mobile phone being used in an EU member state other than its own, which were seen as disproportionally high by the commission. It was approved despite opposition from mobile phone operators, however the Socialists in Parliament had wanted more concessions from industry.

Reding has seen the legislation as a success and stated that, despite initial fears, there have not been price rises on domestic calls as a result of the caps. However she noted that operators had instead tried to &quot;trick&quot; users to switching to more expensive tariffs or using more expensive options such as texting which was not covered by the legislation.

===Other policy===
The REACH directive was another major piece of legislation agreed in 2006 after three years of negotiations. The directive aims to regulate the use of over 30,000 chemicals used in the EU (which produces 28% of the worlds chemicals) for risks to the environmental or human health. The commission&#x27;s proposals were watered down by Parliament who were seen by some environmental groups as watering down the proposals. The directive was the largest single piece of legislation ever produced by the commission and is expected to set the standards for the rest of the world.

10 January 2007 marked the publication of the commission&#x27;s first venture into an EU energy policy, which had an emphasis on fighting climate change with a binding target of a 20% cut in greenhouse gases by 2020. The policy also aimed for a true common energy market, more low-carbon energy and through this, greater energy independence from oil exporters such as Russia.

In a case inherited from the Prodi Commission, Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes had engaged in a drawn out case against Microsoft concerning abuse of its dominant market position. Microsoft refused to comply with the Commissions demands and received a 497 million euro fine, the largest imposed by the commission on a single company. In this case, European Union v. Microsoft, Microsoft failed to win its appeal at the European Court of Justice in 2007 and agreed to co-operate with the commission.

On 3 March 2010, president Barroso announced Europe 2020, a proposal for a major 10-year strategy aimed at reviving the European economy. It targets &quot;smart, sustainable, inclusive growth&quot; with greater co-ordination of national and European policy.

On 5 December 2012 the antitrust regulators of Barroso Commission fined Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung SDI, Panasonic, Toshiba and Technicolor for price fixing of TV cathode-ray tubes in two cartels lasting nearly a decade. The biggest fine, of 313.4 million euros, was imposed on Philips, followed by LG Electronics with 295.6 million euros. Panasonic was fined 157.5 million euros, Samsung SDI 150.8 million euros, Technicolor 38.6 million euros and Toshiba 28 million euros.

==Composition==
The Barroso Commission is led by president José Manuel Barroso and consists of 26 other Commissioners (24 between 2004 and 2007). There is one member from each European Union member state, nine are women and members are drawn primarily from the three major European political parties, Barroso himself being from the European People&#x27;s Party. There are seven Vice-Presidents and the most senior is Catherine Ashton.

===President===
The President is the former Prime Minister of Portugal; José Manuel Barroso. He took over from former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi who served from 1999 (Prodi Commission). He is a member of the European People&#x27;s Party and was appointed by the European Council in June 2004 in response to the victory of the EPP-ED in the 2004 European elections. Some of Barroso&#x27;s stated aims are to tackle voter apathy and euroscepticism, visible during those elections, to work with the United States and to develop a &quot;defence identity.&quot;

Barroso comes from a small integrationist state and had become unpopular due to his economic policies. His government had backed the United States in the Iraq War. The leader of the socialist group, Martin Schulz, criticised him for his pro- war stance, optimised by his organisation of the Azores summit. Despite such opposition, the European Parliament approved him as president by 413, although there were difficulties over his choice of Commissioners (see below).

He has earned some criticism due to his leadership of the expanded Commission – with it being notably more Presidential than his predecessors. Barroso had unusually been linked with all the commission&#x27;s major initiatives, for example those on energy and climate change, rather than the particular Commissioner responsible. He also had a number of &quot;pet projects&quot; such as the Galileo positioning system and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.

He had also been accused of acting in favour of larger states to secure a desired second term in office. This has gone so far as to overrule Commissioner McCreevy (internal market commissioner) from overhauling artists&#x27; levies after pressure from France, despite Barroso himself being an economic liberal. In July 2008 he succeeded in winning the support of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Parliament President Hans-Gert Pöttering and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. However he has stated it is up to the parties in Parliament to decide and that despite his attempts for re-election being well known, he never publicly declared this intention until an interview on 19 July 2008. He further stated he felt honoured and privileged to serve as president. In fact, he did consider resigning as president during the talks on the Treaty of Lisbon, notably due to notorious disagreements between Germany and Poland, but considered to do so would be &quot;too theatrical&quot;. In October 2008 he won the informal support of the European People&#x27;s Party for re-election. The EPP came out as the largest party after the 2009 elections and, after gaining the support of other rightist parties, Barroso won Parliament&#x27;s support for a second term on 16 September 2009. His team was approved by Parliament in February 2010 after a number of concessions to Parliament.

===First college===
Member states appointed one Commissioner each (including the President). It was the first Commission where larger member-states did not have two Commissioners and the first full Commission following the 2004 enlargement. From 2004 there were 25 members, raising to 27 from 2007. There were 9 women in the college as of 3 March 2008 and no ethnic minorities, Barroso had stated he wished for more women in his Commission, than in previous Commissions, and he would use his influence over national capitals to gain this. Most Commissioners (20) were born in the 1940s and 1950s with the youngest member being Olli Rehn (born 1962) and the oldest being Jacques Barrot (born 1937).

Most members were former ministers with links to the Union, for example being Foreign Minister, Minister for European Affairs or represented their country in accession talks or at the European Convention. In addition to Barroso both Siim Kallas and Vladimír Špidla were former Prime Ministers. Viviane Reding was the only Commissioner with a background in the European Parliament.

Politically they came from each of the major political parties; the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (8), the European People&#x27;s Party (8) and the Party of European Socialists (6). In addition there were 4 Independents and one member of the Alliance for Europe of the Nations. Barroso had been complimented for balancing the portfolios between countries, such as between small and large, new and old, and pro- and anti- (Iraq) war. Before 2007 there were only 7 Liberals and 3 Independents.

===Second college===

The second Barroso Commission was elected by Parliament on 9 February 2010 after securing concessions from president Barroso and securing the replacement of the Bulgarian designate. They had support from all except for The Greens–European Free Alliance and the European United Left–Nordic Green Left and the European Conservatives and Reformists. The new college included the High Representative for the first time, due to changes from the Lisbon Treaty. Therefore, the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, became &quot;ex-officio&quot; First-Vice-President.

Despite requests for more women, member states nominated only nine women of the twenty-seven designates. In keeping with the balance in the council, and Barroso&#x27;s voting base in parliament, most Commissions stem from the centre-right with 13 from the EPP, 7 from ALDE and only 7 from the centre-left PES. 13 members (including all the vice-presidents) are staying on from the previous Barroso Commission and Barnier served in the Prodi Commission. Below are all the Commissioners as their appointment. Some innovations include splitting the justice, freedom and security portfolio, creating the climate action portfolio and reversing the splits created in 2007 for the Bulgarian and Romanian commissioners. When Croatia joined the EU in July 2013, the Health/Consumer Protection split made during Bulgaria&#x27;s accession in 2007 was replicated.

Dalli was forced to resign in October 2012 due to a lobbying frame-up. His replacement is Tonio Borg.

Five commissioners (Janusz Lewandowski, Neven Mimica, Viviane Reding, Maroš Šefčovič and Antonio Tajani) took electoral leave from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while Olli Rehn began his leave earlier from 7 April 2014. During that time, each of their portfolios was taken over by Andris Piebalgs, László Andor, Johannes Hahn, José Manuel Barroso, Michel Barnier and Siim Kallas, respectively. After the elections and parliament&#x27;s promulgation on 1 July 2014, Lewandowski, Reding, Rehn and Tajani took up their seats as MEPs and were each replaced by the same commissioners as when they were on leave (Piebalgs, Hahn, Kallas and Barnier, respectively). Karel De Gucht took neither electoral leave nor his eventual seat.

==Civil service==

The Secretary-General for this term was Catherine Day, appointed in 2005. She was the first woman to hold the post and took over from David O&#x27;Sullivan. Early favourite François Lamoureux, previously in charge of Transport, had health problems and his being infirm was seen as a political blow to France and a final break from the Delors era, instead giving the commission a more liberal economic outlook. Commissioner Kallas stressed the appointments were on merit, resisting pressure from national capitals.

Day was part of a vast reshuffle of Commission officials by the President after he came to power. The reshuffle was welcomed by the right-wing as the new directors-general, including Day, were liberal reformers, many British and German. A move which did not go down well with France, symbolic of their loss of influence, who were opposed to Day due to her liberal economic reforms. Indeed, Day became very notable in the commission for her opposition to French state aid policies.

Concern has been expressed by Commissioners such as Günter Verheugen in regards to overlap of mandates and fractionalisation of the commission&#x27;s Directorates-General, leading to &quot;turf-wars&quot; and a lack of co-ordination. A great deal of the commission&#x27;s effort is expended in this in-fighting and weaker Commissioners, such as Verheugen, have not been able to gain sufficient control over their department.

==Politicisation==

During Barroso&#x27;s tenure, the commission has seen a general increase in the politicisation of its members. Although members are supposed to remain above national politics, members have been involved in national elections or backed national candidates. For example, Commissioner Michel participated in the 2007 Belgian elections while Commissioner Kroes backed Angela Merkel in the 2005 German elections and vice-president Wallström backed Ségolène Royal in the 2007 French elections.

Michel claimed that politicisation of this manner is part of reconnecting the Union with its citizens and Wallström defended it claiming that the EU has to get more political and controversial as being a vital role in communicating the commission. Wallström presented plans to give greater prominence to European political parties ahead of the 2009 elections and give the parties the ability to run with candidates for Commission President. There was speculation that under this scenario, if he gained backing, Barroso might run as the People&#x27;s Party candidate in 2009.

<text>The first season of the television series &quot;Lost&quot; commenced airing in the United States and Canada on September 22, 2004, concluded on May 25, 2005, and contained 25 episodes. It introduces the 48 survivors of a plane that broke apart in mid-air, scattering them on a remote island in the South Pacific. Forced to work together to survive, they come to realize it is no ordinary island.

The first season aired Wednesdays at 8:00 pm in the United States. In addition to the 25 regular episodes, a special, &quot;&quot;, was aired on April 27, 2005, between the 20th and 21st episodes of the season. The season was released on DVD as a seven-disc boxed set under the title of &quot;Lost: The Complete First Season&quot; on September 6, 2005, by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

== Reception ==
On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 87 out of 100, based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;Universal acclaim&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 94% with an average score of 8.9/10 based on 46 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Unpredictable and addictive, &quot;Lost&quot; is a new kind of TV mystery that grips as often as it guffaws.&quot;

The pilot episode garnered 18.6 million viewers, winning the 9:00 pm (Eastern) timeslot, and giving ABC its strongest ratings since 2000 when &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; initially aired—beaten only the following month by the premiere of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. Based on its strong opening, Reuters dubbed it a &quot;hit drama&quot; noting that &quot;the show appeared to have benefited from an all-out marketing blitz that included radio spots, special screenings and ABC&#x27;s first billboard advertising campaign in five years.&quot; After four episodes aired, ABC announced &quot;Lost&quot; had been picked up for a full season order. &quot;Lost&quot;″s first season averaged about 17.6 million American viewers.

The first season was nominated for twelve Primetime Emmy Awards. They won six: Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (J. J. Abrams for &quot;Pilot&quot;), Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) (Michael Giacchino), Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. Terry O&#x27;Quinn and Naveen Andrews received nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. J. J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof and Jeffrey Lieber were nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for &quot;Pilot&quot;, with David Fury receiving a nomination in the same category for the episode &quot;Walkabout&quot;. The series also received nominations for Outstanding Single-Camera Sound Mixing for a Series, Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series. The show was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama.

<doc id="1130636" wikidata="Q652022" url="?curid=1130636" title="Master Chief (Halo)">
<text>Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, colloquially known as Master Chief, is the protagonist of the &quot;Halo&quot; video game series and its spin-off media. The character first appeared in the 2001 video game &quot;&quot;, a science fiction first-person shooter that became a long-running franchise. The character also appears in spin-off &quot;Halo&quot; media such as the 2012 film &quot;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn,&quot; the 2022–2024 &quot;Halo&quot; television series, and several graphic novels and books.

The Master Chief is a towering supersoldier known as a &quot;Spartan&quot;, trained from childhood for combat. The designers intended for players to be able to project their own intentions into the character and thus reduced his voiced lines and concealed his appearance under his armor. In the video games, the character is voiced by former disc jockey Steve Downes, who based his performance on Bungie&#x27;s description calling for a man of few words, similar to Clint Eastwood. In spin-off media, he is portrayed by different voice and physical actors, most notably Pablo Schreiber on the 2022 live-action TV series.

A pop culture icon, Master Chief is widely regarded as one of the greatest video game characters of all time, with the character being seen as a mascot for &quot;Halo&quot; and the Xbox brand. His 2001 debut received a generally positive reception for his character design, with publications praising how the narrative allows players to inhabit the character, while others have criticized him as under-characterized. In later &quot;Halo&quot; games developed by 343 Industries, the characterization of Master Chief earned praise for exploring his humanity and his relationship with Cortana.

==Character design==

When game studio Bungie began developing &quot;&quot; (2001), the design of Master Chief was led by art director Marcus Lehto with support from artist Robert McLees. Shi Kai Wang was later hired as a concept artist, who created a sketch that became the basis for Master Chief. When the sketch was translated into a three-dimensional model, the team felt that it looked too slim and anime-inspired, and Lehto asked for a bulkier character design that felt more like a walking tank. The Chief&#x27;s armor went through various changes, such as green tint, and the addition (and later removal) of an antenna. The character&#x27;s two-prong visor, intended to convey speed and agility, was inspired by BMX helmets.

For much of the game&#x27;s development, the character had no name. Master Chief was always intended to be a soldier in a difficult war, and the team first referred to him as the &quot;Future Soldier&quot; or &quot;The Cyborg&quot;. Eric Nylund established the character&#x27;s birth name as &quot;John&quot; in the tie-novel &quot;&quot;, but Bungie preferred to avoid using this in the game. Looking to military ranks for inspiration, the developers were attracted to naval ranks as &quot;different&quot; from other game characters. McLees, insisting on accuracy, wanted to make sure the character still had a plausible rank for his role. &quot;Master Chief&quot; was the highest non-commissioned rank where the character would still be considered &quot;expendable&quot;. McLees also felt the shortened &quot;Chief&quot; sounded more colloquial and less like a modern military designation. Though &quot;Master Chief&quot; was intended to be a placeholder, and drew some internal disagreement, the name ended up sticking. Writer Joseph Staten recalled that early on in &quot;Halo&quot;″s development, they had not considered how to engage players in the world, and Master Chief&#x27;s character was what drew people in.

In developing the sequel &quot;Halo 2&quot;, Bungie decided to &quot;tone down&quot; the character&#x27;s design, according to Mclees, keeping a few recognizable elements like the visor and coloring. In the fiction, the character received a new design including upgraded armor, with residual damage illustrated in the high-definition graphics of &quot;Halo 3&quot; as the developers had more graphics budget for higher-fidelity models.

For &quot;Halo 4&quot;, Bungie bought their independence from Microsoft, with Microsoft assigning further &quot;Halo&quot; development to 343 Industries. Art director Kenneth Scott aimed to find a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where Master Chief&#x27;s armor remained familiar but still new. The armor was redesigned to feel futuristic and heavy, weighing hundreds of pounds, with details inspired by real-world military vehicles. In contrast to newer characters, Master Chief and elder Spartan soldiers were designed with more utilitarian armor similar to a tank. Despite the visual differences between the character&#x27;s armor in &quot;Halo3&quot; and &quot;Halo4&quot;, the developers intended it to canonically be the same armor. &quot;Halo4&quot; also made extensive use of motion capture for character animation, with Bruce Thomas portraying Master Chief while interacting with multiple actors in studio. Even without his face or voice appearing in the game, Thomas was credited by creative director Josh Holmes for conveying Master Chief&#x27;s physicality and emotions, and for influencing the other actors&#x27; performances. With the development of &quot;Halo Infinite,&quot; Thomas returned to provide motion capture for the character, as he had in &quot;Halo4&quot; and &quot;Halo5&quot;. 343 Industries redesigned Master Chief&#x27;s armor once again, drawing inspiration from the character&#x27;s previous appearances.

=== Voice acting ===
Bungie designed Master Chief as a man of few words, similar to Clint Eastwood characters. The game designers crafted the first game&#x27;s experience as lonely, to reinforce the backstory that Chief&#x27;s friends had been largely killed. Master Chief rarely spoke in the early &quot;Halo&quot; games, making him an almost-silent protagonist. Joseph Staten felt that Master Chief was designed to promote immersion, as &quot;the less players knew about the Chief, we believed, the more they would feel like the Chief.&quot; Some at Bungie were against the release of the tie-in novel &quot;The Fall of Reach&quot; because they felt that Master Chief should remain more mysterious.

Bungie hired voice actor Steve Downes as the voice of Master Chief. Downes had begun his career as a Chicago disc jockey, and was recommended by Bungie musical director Martin O&#x27;Donnell, based on their rapport from working together on the game &quot;Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator&quot;. &quot;Septerra&quot; was the first time Downes had performed as a voice actor for a game&quot;,&quot; and he had never played a video game until &quot;Halo&quot;. According to Downes, he was offered the part over the phone without an interview or audition.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameinformer-downes/dadabo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Downes was given creative freedom to develop the Chief&#x27;s personality during recording. Still, many of the character&#x27;s lines in the first game were eventually cut, as Staten felt that the more the character spoke, &quot;the more chances there are that we’ll get it wrong for you, whoever you are.&quot; With the wide success of the &quot;Halo&quot; series, Bungie considered recasting a celebrity for the role before deciding against it. 

343 Industries took over development of the series with &quot;Halo 4&quot;, which designed Master Chief as a more fully realized human being instead of just a vessel for the players. Downes felt that his audition for &quot;Halo 4&quot; would need to demonstrate more emotional weight, and recalls that he felt like he could have lost the role. He became more involved throughout the development of &quot;Halo 4&quot;, giving input on advance scripts, and recording in longer sessions. Where Master Chief began the first game with an artificial intelligence companion named Cortana, designed as a gameplay tool to guide the player, Cortana also became a narrative tool to reveal the protagonist&#x27;s humanity. As such, &quot;Halo 4&quot; became the first game to have Downes interacting with actress Jen Taylor (Cortana) in the same space. &quot;Halo 4&quot; creative director Josh Holmes cited the game &quot;Ico&quot; as an inspiration for the Chief-Cortana relationship, noting how the game told a story without dialogue, while also balancing the protagonist&#x27;s character development with his stoic nature.

For years, Downes avoided appearances at Bungie or Microsoft events, believing that the character&#x27;s identity &quot;is really in the eye of the player.&quot; He has called the role the most rewarding of his voice acting career.

==Appearances==
In every &quot;Halo&quot; game, the Master Chief is rarely seen without his armor. Cutscenes were designed to avoid revealing the character&#x27;s face in order to aid players in identifying with the character. Some games have teased a reveal, such as the first game ending with him removing his helmet or one of the endings of &quot;Halo 4&quot; briefly showing the character&#x27;s eyes. O&#x27;Connor said in an interview that revealing the character&#x27;s face is not as important as the events happening around him.

The Master Chief&#x27;s backstory is revealed in the 2001 novel &quot;The Fall of Reach&quot;. Born &quot;John&quot; in 2511, he is covertly taken from the human colony world of Eridanus as a child and conscripted into the SPARTAN-II super-soldier project by the United Nations Space Command (UNSC). John proves a natural leader and leads his peers over eight years of grueling training and dangerous physical augmentation. In the 2003 novel &quot;Halo: The Flood&quot;, the Master Chief is described as tall with short brown hair, serious eyes, and strong features. His skin is unnaturally pale as a consequence of spending most of his time in his armor. He stands about 7feet (2.13m) tall and weighs 1,000 pounds (450kg) in armor; without it, he stands 6feet, 10inches (2.08m) tall and weighs 287pounds (130kg).

===Main game series===
Master Chief first appears in &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, the first game in the series. Master Chief and the crew of the UNSC ship &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot; discover an alien ringworld, called Alpha Halo. Master Chief is entrusted with safeguarding Cortana, the ship&#x27;s artificial intelligence, from capture to ensure that the Covenant don&#x27;t learn about Earth and attack the human colony. While fighting the Covenant (a cult attempting to light the halo rings thinking it will give them the Mantle of Responsibility), Master Chief and Cortana learn that an ancient race known as the Forerunners created Halo as a last line of defense against an alien parasite called the Flood, which begins to spread across the ring. Learning that the Halo was designed to contain the Flood by killing all life in the galaxy, thus killing all potential hosts, Master Chief detonates the &quot;Pillar of Autumn&quot; in order to destroy Halo, escaping in a fighter spacecraft with Cortana.

Master Chief returns to Earth in &quot;Halo 2&quot; (2004), defending the planet from a Covenant invasion. Pursuing a fleeing Covenant vessel, Master Chief and his crew discover another Halo ring. Master Chief is captured by a Flood intelligence known as a Gravemind, who forges an alliance between them and the disgraced Covenant commander known as the Arbiter. The Gravemind sends them to stop the Halo&#x27;s activation, with Master Chief arriving at the Covenant space station &quot;High Charity&quot;, near the Halo&#x27;s orbit. Cortana remains on the space station to ensure the ring is destroyed if activated. Master Chief pursues the remaining Covenant leader, the Prophet of Truth, who plans to activate the Halo Array from outside the galaxy.

The story continues in &quot;Halo 3&quot; (2007), when Master Chief reunites with the Arbiter to stop the Prophet of Truth. Master Chief and Arbiter pursue the Prophet through a portal to the Ark, a place located beyond the Milky Way. On the Ark, the Flood-controlled &quot;High Charity&quot; crashes into the installation. Master Chief stops the Halo Array from firing and rescues Cortana by battling through the wreckage of &quot;High Charity&quot;. Together, they activate a replacement Halo being built on the Ark, stopping the Flood and sparing the galaxy at large. While the Arbiter reaches Earth, Master Chief and Cortana escape aboard the UNSC ship &quot;Forward Unto Dawn&quot; before setting adrift in space.

Master Chief returns as the playable protagonist in &quot;Halo 4&quot; (2012)&quot;&quot; after his omission from &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot; (2009) and a brief Easter egg in &quot;&quot; (2010). &quot;Halo 4&quot; begins with Cortana awakening Master Chief from cryonic sleep, both drifting toward a Forerunner installation called Requiem. Hoping to prevent the UNSC ship &quot;Infinity&quot; from also being drawn into Requiem, Master Chief and Cortana attempt to activate what they believe is a communications relay. Instead, Master Chief awakens the Didact, a Forerunner with a grudge against humanity. Master Chief and Cortana pursue the Didact, stopping his attack on Earth when Cortana sacrifices herself.

At the start of &quot;Halo 5: Guardians&quot; (2015), Master Chief is contacted by Cortana, presumed to be destroyed in the previous game. She directs him to the human colony of Meridian. By leading his Blue Team to the colony against UNSC orders, Master Chief provokes a rival group of Spartans, Fireteam Osiris. The Blue Team boards a buried Forerunner construct known as a Guardian, which transports them to the Forerunner planet Genesis. Cortana reveals that she survived thanks to the Domain, a repository of ancient Forerunner knowledge. A degenerating and thus newly evil Cortana reveals her authoritarian plans for the galaxy and imprisons Master Chief and his team in stasis. They are rescued through the efforts of Fireteams Osiris but forced to retreat as Cortana mobilizes the Forerunner Guardians and other human AIs as her enforcers.

Master Chief returns as the main protagonist in &quot;Halo Infinite&quot; (2021). The story has him work with the Weapon, an AI modeled after Cortana, to stop another Halo from being activated by space pirates known as the Banished.

===Spin-off media===
Initial plans for a &quot;Halo&quot; film were abandoned around 2008, which would have featured a faceless depiction of Master Chief. The character made his live-action debut in the 2012 film &quot;Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn&quot;, portrayed physically by Daniel Cudmore, with voice acting from Alex Puccinelli. On the 2022 &quot;Halo&quot; television series, the character is played by Pablo Schreiber. Master Chief takes off his helmet in the series in an effort to make the audience empathize with the character.

Master Chief is a major character in the novels &quot;Silent Storm&quot; (2018), &quot;Oblivion&quot; (2019), and &quot;Shadows of Reach&quot; (2020), written by Troy Denning. The character also appears in the 2010 animated anthology &quot;Halo Legends&quot;, as well as the comics &quot;The Halo Graphic Novel&quot;, &quot;Halo: Uprising&quot;, &quot;Halo: Collateral Damage&quot;, and &quot;Halo: Tales from Slipspace&quot;. Peter David&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Helljumpers&quot; contains a cameo by Master Chief &quot;before he actually &quot;was&quot; [the Chief]&quot;.

The character also appears in games outside the &quot;Halo&quot; series. This includes a guest appearance as a playable character in &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot; for the Xbox One and a cosmetic outfit in the battle royale game &quot;&quot;. &quot;Fable II&quot; includes a medieval variation of Master Chief&#x27;s armor, worn by a legendary hero named &quot;Hal&quot;. The character is also referenced in &quot;Halo&quot;-based machinima parody series &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, created by Rooster Teeth Productions. When Team Ninja approached Bungie to use Master Chief in &quot;Dead or Alive 4&quot; (2006), they declined due to storyline restrictions, resulting in the inclusion of another Spartan super-soldier named Nicole (Spartan-458).

===Marketing and merchandise===
The &quot;Halo&quot; video games have emphasized Master Chief in their marketing. This includes campaigns such as &quot;The Museum&quot; and &quot;Believe&quot; for &quot;Halo3&quot;, a trailer for &quot;Halo4&quot;, the &quot;Hunt the Truth&quot; for &quot;Halo 5&quot;, and &quot;Become&quot; for &quot;Halo&quot; &quot;Infinite&quot;. The character has also been featured on several physical products, including Slurpees, Mountain Dew, branded controllers, and clothing. Several Master Chief action figures were marketed around the &quot;Halo&quot; series, including lines by McFarlane, Jazwares, 1000toys, and Mega Bloks. One2One collectibles also produced 1:2 scale busts of the Master Chief. Xbox marketing director Ed Ventura explained, &quot;We want to be in the hearts and minds of our fans as much as we can.&quot;

==Analysis==
Reviewers have suggested that Master Chief&#x27;s birth name John-117 could be a Biblical reference. Comparing &quot;Halo&quot; to the Christopher Rowley&#x27;s novel &quot;Starhammer,&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; noted similar elements between Master Chief and the character Jon 6725416. Michael Nitsche of the Georgia Institute of Technology compared Master Chief to &quot;Half-Life&quot; protagonist Gordon Freeman, as both characters &quot;are the independent, individualistic, and often lonely heroes that gain admiration by constantly proving their superiority... in technology-driven, hostile, often closed spaces.&quot; Roger Travis, associate professor of classics at the University of Connecticut, compared Master Chief to the epic hero Aeneas, as both settings involve superhuman characters protecting civilization against militaristic enemies. Matthew Stover compared &quot;Halo&quot; to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, due to the shared theme that &quot;war is the crucible of character&quot;. Stover also argues that the cyborg is an apt characterization for the Master Chief, since the character is more relatable than a pure machine, but still not fully characterized as a human being.

==Cultural impact==
===Reception===
Master Chief is a gaming icon, and has appeared on multiple publications&#x27; lists of the best video gaming characters; a 2024 poll conducted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts named Master Chief as the eighth most iconic video game character of all time. Downes realized the character was a huge hit only after children lined up around the block for his autograph, a year after the first game shipped.

Writing for &quot;Time&quot;, Lev Grossman called the Master Chief a &quot;new kind of celebrity for a new and profoundly weird millennium&quot;, as well as a sign of video games becoming a more legitimate art form. On the occasion of Madame Tussauds unveiling a wax sculpture of the Chief, Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy called the Master Chief a hero of the times as much as characters like Spider-Man and Luke Skywalker were for previous generations. Master Chief has also been called the &quot;de facto&quot; mascot or symbol for Microsoft, their Xbox console, and a generation of gamers. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; listed the Master Chief among several video game characters who have been branded beyond their respective video games, &quot;helping them transcend the very medium in the process&quot;.

The faceless nature of the character has alternatively been praised and criticized. Writing for &quot;The Artifice&quot;, Sam Gray argued that the character&#x27;s lack of conflict made him uninteresting, as he uncomfortably straddles the line between silent and active protagonist. O&#x27;Connor noted that players invest the character with much of his meaning, creating a conflict between players who prefer more personality and those who prefer &quot;a sort of paragon of useful emptiness&quot;. Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; has called him gaming&#x27;s most overrated character, due to his status as a &quot;generic&quot; action hero.

The more character-focused portrayal of Chief in &quot;Halo4&quot; was positively received. Todd Martens of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Halo4&quot; a more introspective &quot;Halo&quot; game, and the first to explore the motivations and emotions of the Master Chief. While reviews found the game&#x27;s story hard to follow, they praised efforts to flesh out Master Chief&#x27;s personality and relationship with Cortana. &quot;Halo 5&quot; received backlash from fans about Master Chief&#x27;s reduced role in the story, as he appeared in fewer story missions compared to Fireteam Osiris. &quot;Kotaku&quot;″s Stephen Totilo wrote that the confrontation between Locke and Master Chief felt &quot;under-cooked&quot;, preferring how &quot;Hunt the Truth&quot; presented the story of a rogue Master Chief. O&#x27;Connor responded by promising to refocus on Master Chief in future media.

<text>The National Election Pool (NEP) is a consortium of American news organizations formed in 2003 to provide exit polling information for US elections, replacing the Voter News Service following the latter&#x27;s disbandment the same year. 

The system produced skewed results in the 2004 US presidential election and in the 2016 presidential election.

As of 2018, member companies ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and NBC News contracts with Edison Research to conduct exit polling and a quick turnaround of nationwide vote tabulation. Starting in 2020, Reuters has used the NEP for U.S. presidential election results and exit polls. Fox News and the Associated Press formerly were part of the Pool, but left in 2017 due to plans to conduct their exit polls and other experimental alternatives to gauge voter sentiment. These two networks have since joined AP VoteCast.

The organizers of the pool say that the purpose of their quick collection of exit poll data is not to determine if an election is flawed, but rather to project winners of races. Despite past problems, they note that all of their members have correctly called a winner since the current system was put in place. However, to avoid the premature leaking of data, collection is now done in a &quot;Quarantine Room&quot; at an undisclosed location in New York. All participants are stripped of outside communication devices until it is time for information to be released officially.

<doc id="1130645" wikidata="Q825006" url="?curid=1130645" title="Hinzelmann">
<text>Hinzelmann (orig. Hintzelmann; , also known as &#x27; or &#x27;) was a kobold in the mythology of northern Germany. He was described as a household spirit of ambivalent nature, similar to Puck (Robin Goodfellow).
The similar-sounding Heinzelmann (Heinzelmännchen) of Cologne is considered a distinct and separate being by modern scholars.

==Editions and background==

The legend was recorded in Pfarrer (pastor) Marquart Feldmann&#x27;s diary for the years 1584–1589, and published by an anonymous author as &quot;Der vielförmige Hintzelmann&quot; in three duodecimo editions, 1701. &quot;sine loco&quot;; 1704, Leipzig; and 1718. s.l.

The castle where the haunting took place was used as shelter during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) but thereafter abandoned by the Lords of Hudemühlen, and was so derelict by 1704 [1701] that the chamber where the Hintzelmann did his meddling could hardly be discovered.

==Nomenclature==
The Hinzelmann, a type of kobold, is discussed alongside various similarly sounding spirit names, and cat-related spirit names, by Jacob Grimm in &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;. He argues that the similar sprite-names relate to the cat, and in particular is comparable to the form (variant reading of , in the poem &quot;Der Renner&quot;).

Also the name &quot;Heinze&quot; occurring as sprite name is described as diminutives of the common name Heinrich by Grimm, however, it is probably more apt to describe it as a pet name (hypocorism; ).

Hinzelmann and are listed together under the category of kobold alluding to cat-shape (not &quot;hypocorism&quot; type names like &quot;Hank&quot; or &quot;Jimmy&quot;) in the (&quot;HdA&quot;).
Grimm comments in this connection that Hinz was the name of the cat in &quot;Reineke&quot; (i.e., &quot;Reynard the Fox&quot;, cf. fig. right), so that Hinz/Hinze became an emblematic name for a &quot;cat&quot;. Also, the names (Hinz, Hinze, or Heinz) represents a cat-man (werecat?) type being in regional German folklore, a sort of wee-sized beast-man (), comparable to English &quot;tomcat&quot;. The lore is perhaps also related to the anthropomorphosized cat, Puss-in-Boots, as suggested by Grimm.

While Grimm tended to lump Hinzelmann and Heinzelman together, it has been clarified that the Heinzelmännchen attached to the city of Cologne is to be distinguished from it both in terms of character and appearance.

==Legend==

An abridged version of the legend was printed by the Grimms (1816) as No. 75 &quot;Hinzelmann&quot; in their &quot;Deutsche sagen&quot; anthology, sourced solely from the book properly titled &quot;Der vielförmige Hintzelmann&quot; (1704), ascribed to Pastor Marquart (Marcqvart) Feldmann at Eickeloh who kept his day-book in the years 1584–1589.

According to this legend, the Hinzelmann (&quot;Hintzelmann&quot; in the original source) began haunting the castle Hudemühlen in Lower Saxony beginning in the year 1584. First only its presence was felt from the banging noises. He then began to talk to servants in the castle, and when the humans began to grow accustomed and no longer feared him, began telling his personal details, that he was named Lüring, with a wife named Hille Bingels, and that he used to live in the Bohemian Forest mountain range. The copperplate engraving illustrates the spirit looking rather cherubic with a pair of feathered wings (see fig. right).

The presence of the drove the lord of the Castle to remove himself to Hanover, but only temporarily as it turns out, because the poltergeist followed him in the guise of a &quot;white feather&quot; (cf. Willy Pogány&#x27;s illustration above). At an inn, the lord blamed the disappearance of his gold chain on the innkeeper&#x27;s servants, but the sprite privately appeared and disclosed the whereabouts of the chain to be under the pillow. The lord, realizing the flight to be futile, immediately returned home.
Hinzelmann would usefully and dedicatedly perform kitchen chores such as tableware and dish-washing, recover lost items, and groom horses. It gave advice or pep talks, but could strike with a stick when his words are not paid attention to. It was said to occupy it own room with chair, table, and bed (cf. fig. right).

The cook or the servants were obliged to put out a bowl of sweet milk with crumbled white bread in it, left sitting on the table meant for its use. And afterwards, the bowl would be found eaten clean, and empty.

Hinzelmann was also useful finding things that had been lost in the household. He had a rhyme he liked to sing: &quot;If thou here wilt let me stay, / Good luck shalt thou have alway; / But if hence thou wilt me chase, / Luck will ne&#x27;er come near the place&quot;, which perhaps referred to a nobleman who attempted to drive him away. Also after Hinzelmann thrashed the haughty secretary named Henning Steinhoff working at the castle, catching him during a tryst with the chambermaid, (cf. kobold#Good-evil duality) he composed a rhyme to boast about it, and would sing it to travelers with glee.

Sometimes he would make his presence known at the master&#x27;s table, then the servants would be obliged to place dishes at &quot;his&quot; seat and serve food, or incur his wrath. The Hinzelmann was certainly a trickster, but his pranks were generally harmless. A comparison has been made between the Hinzelmann and Puck (Robin Goodfellow) of English tradition. One of Hinzelmann&#x27;s pranks was to pinch drunken men to make them start fights with their companions.

Hinzelmann once warned a colonel to be careful on his daily hunt. The man ignored the advice, only to have his gun backfire and shoot off his thumb. Hinzelmann appeared to him and said, &quot;See, now, you have got what I warned you of! If you had refrained from shooting this time, this mischance would not have befallen you&quot;.

Hinzelmann also predicted the demise of a certain lord Falkenberg who while visiting taunted and provoked the spirit with trickery. The annoyed Hinzelmann announced the lord&#x27; cap would be burst at Magdeburg, stunning the Lord with the veiled death message. Sure enough, Falkenberg had his chin blown off at the Siege of Magdeburg (1550–1551), and perished. This incident anachronistically places the spirit already at the castle by 1550. 

Hinzelmann outwitted a nobleman who covered the jug&#x27;s mouth to trap the creature inside, the kobold then told the nobleman everyone knew him as a fool, and promised some slight reprisal.

Hinzelmann became particularly attached to two noble ladies who lived at Hudemühlen, named Anne and Catherine. He shadowed them whenever they traveled, assuming the guise of a white feather. He scared away their suitors so that these ladies remained unmarried thought they lived a long life.

A nobleman tried to exorcize it and failed; during the attempt to catch the sprite, it revealed itself in the form of a black marten, then a coiled large snake. Then a professional exorcist was sent in, chanting out of a spellbook, which the spirit snatched away and tore into pieces. The spirit then caught hold of the excorcist from the charterhouse () and thrashed him too, so that the clergyman wanted nothing further to do with the spirit. The Hinzelmann professed there was no evil in him (note he claimed earlier to have a Christian for a mother), and asked to be left alone. When a nobleman protested that a seat at the dinner table was set for the spirit, and refused to drink to the kobold&#x27;s honour, it prompted Hinzelmann to grab the man under his chin by the buckled strap () of his cloak, drag him the ground, and choke him near to death.
The Hinzelmann rarely manifested itself, but when it did visibly appear to young children and a half-wit, it assumed the guise of a young child wearing a red samite (thick silk) jacket, with blond (yellow) curly locks of hair reaching the shoulders. In one anecdote, he showed his true form to a maid, who fainted; it was a corpse of a child around three years of age, stabbed in the chest by two knives (cf. fig. right). She fainted and needed to be revived by splashing the pails of water she was instructed to bring. However, the hats and the knife-struck child anecdote is common to the legends of kobolds by other names.

The Lord of the castle who never saw the Hinzelmann succeeded in at least grabbing him, and feeling him to his touch. Hinzelmann&#x27;s fingers were childlike, and his face was like a skull, without body heat. Pastor Feldmann himself, at the age of 14 or 15, claimed to have borne witness to the Hinzelmann hurriedly running up the steps, and while the figure and its clothing and coloration could be discerned, it seemed more a &quot;transparent shadow () than a right veritable body&quot;. 

The mementos that the spirit allegedly bequeathed to the lord, first entrusted to the care of his sisters, Anne and Catherine, are also described in detail. Feldmann&#x27;s book continues on until the 31st chapter, and the Grimms&#x27; digest can also be consulted for this remainder. In the end, of the spirit left the premises on its own volition, having stayed the years 1584–1588.

Although the spirit predicted he would return once again after the deaths of two members in the family, this never transpired according to Pastor Feldmann. The Hinzelmann followed Anne and Catherine to Castle in County of Hoya (in Lüneburg district) in the guise of feather and remained at Estrup until driven out by the lord of the castle, returning from a foreign campaign in service to John III of Sweden.

==Popular culture==
Hinzelmann appears in the Neil Gaiman novel &quot;American Gods&quot;, where he protects the town of Lakeside, Wisconsin from economic trouble: in return he enjoys the annual sacrifice of a town&#x27;s child (though residents remain unaware of the matter). His fictional history describes him as being a god to a tribe of nomads living in the Black Forest before its invasion by the Romans. For the third season of the &quot;American Gods&quot; television series, the deity was adapted as Ann-Marie Hinzelmann, the local busybody and shop owner portrayed by Julia Sweeney.

Hinzelmann is the primary antagonist of the short piece &quot;A Late Symmer Night&#x27;s Battle&quot; by Laura Frankos, printed in &quot;Turn the Other Chick&quot; (ed. Esther Friesner, Baen Books, 2004). He leads an army of kobolds to invade the English fairy kingdom of Oberon and Titania, sometime after the events of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

<doc id="1130646" wikidata="Q3149898" url="?curid=1130646" title="Rover incident">
<text>The &quot;Rover&quot; Incident ( or ) occurred on 12 March 1867 when the American merchant ship &quot;Rover&quot;, captained by Joseph Hunt who was accompanied by his wife Mercy G. &quot;Beerman&quot; Hunt, and en route from Shantou to Niuzhuang, was wrecked off the coast of Taiwan, then ruled by the Qing dynasty. The ship struck a coral reef called Qixingyan near Cape Eluanbi and drifted into the area of Kenting in modern-day Hengchun, Pingtung County, Taiwan. Fourteen American sailors, including Hunt and his wife, were killed by Taiwanese Aborigines in revenge for earlier killings of Kaolut (Koalut/Ku-a-lut/etc) tribe members by foreigners. Subsequently, the U.S. military decided to send a military expedition against the tribe members responsible.

==Shipwreck==
On 12 March 1867, the American barque &quot;Rover&quot; shipwrecked at the southern tip of Taiwan. The vessel sank but the captain, his wife, and some men escaped on two boats. One boat landed at a small bay near the Bi Mountains inhabited by the Koaluts (Guizaijiao) tribe of the Paiwan people. The Koaluts aborigines captured them and mistook the captain&#x27;s wife for a man. They killed her. The captain, two white men, and the Chinese sailors save for one who managed to escape to Takau, were also killed. The &quot;Cormorant&quot;, a British steamer, tried to help and landed near the shipwreck on 26 March. The aborigines fired muskets and shot arrows at them, forcing them to retreat. The American Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s Henry H. Bell also landed at the Bi Mountains where they became lost, suffered heatstroke, and then was ambushed by the aborigines, losing an officer.

==American reaction==

Following the wreck of the United States ship and killing of the surviving crew by aborigines, the American Consul to Amoy Charles William Le Gendre quickly traveled to Fuzhou, arriving on 2 April 1867, to persuade the Viceroys of Fujian and Zhejiang to intervene and put pressure on the Chinese authorities in Taiwan to resolve the issue. The Viceroy of Fujian gave Le Gendre permission to go to Taiwan himself and wrote him a letter of introduction to take to the prefect of Taiwan asking him to cooperate with Le Gendre; but the Viceroy also added that &quot;if the consul takes measures to manage the case himself, please invite him not to do so, for these savages might give him more trouble that he thinks.&quot; Le Gendre commissioned the United States steamer , under the command of Captain John C. Febiger, in order to visit the scene of the wreck and to try (unsuccessfully) to get foreign officials in Taiwanfu (Taiwan&#x27;s capital), where he arrived on 18 April) to act. After a subsequent failed punitive expedition carried out by Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell of the United States Navy, Le Gendre again returned to Taiwan—this time without any reference to his superiors. While in Taiwan, he asserted United States consular authority, selected a deputy consul in north Taiwan, visited the Keelung mines, and gathered information from United States merchants.

On June 19, one hundred and eighty-one officers, sailors, and marines provided with four days&#x27; rations and water landed in Taiwan under Commander George Belknap of the who was accompanied by Lieutenant Commander Alexander Slidell MacKenzie, fleet lieutenant as second in command. In the terrible heat, it was &quot;almost impossible to conduct operations in the middle of the day, and many of the party were attacked by sunstroke. The savages, who had taken up a position in the jungle behind rocks and other places invisible...kept up a heavy fire whenever their foes appeared.&quot; MacKenzie received a mortal wound to his chest from enemy fire. The American force was &quot;compelled to withdraw in some confusion to the ships and soon departed from the island&quot;.

The marines were under the command of Captain James Forney, who submitted the following report to Commander Belknap, dated on board the flagship &quot;Hartford&quot;, at sea, June 17:
:&quot;I have the honor herewith to submit a brief report of the part taken by the Marines on the 13th inst., on the island of Formosa. On the first landing, by your order, I took charge of twenty Marines, deploying them forward as skirmishers. A dense and almost impenetrable thicket of bush prevented the men from advancing very rapidly. I penetrated with them to a creek about half a mile from the beach without meeting any of the enemy, and was then recalled for further orders. You then instructed me to leave a sergeant and five men on the beach, and to advance with the main body, headed by yourself. In consequence of all further operations coming under your own observation, I have nothing further to report, except that the men behaved gallantly, and deserve credit for the manner in which they marched over such a rough and hilly country, and under such intense, scorching heat... The entire number of Marines on shore was forty-three, thirty-one of whom were from this ship, and twelve from the .&quot;

===Second visit===
Upon return to South China, Le Gendre managed to persuade the Viceroy in Fuzhou to send a military force to Southern Taiwan. The force, significantly smaller than the 400 to 500 soldiers recommended by Le Gendre, was dispatched on 25 July 1867. Le Gendre then personally requested a gunboat from Admiral Bell, which he was denied, and eventually managed to commission the steamship &quot;Volunteer&quot;. He embarked for Taiwan on 4 September 1867 telling his superiors that &quot;I am going there as a mere spectator.. . . I have no jurisdiction over the Chinese forces.&quot;

Le Gendre quickly assumed &quot;de facto&quot; command of the mission from General Liu in the course of a long and difficult march into deep aboriginal lands in southern Taiwan (some of which required extensive road construction). Then, with the aid of William A. Pickering and James Horn, Le Gendre negotiated a Memorandum of the Understanding with Tauketok (南岬之盟) guaranteeing the safety of shipwrecked American and European sailors with Tok-a-Tok (1874), the chief of 18 Paiwan aboriginal tribes in the area when the &quot;Rover&quot; had gone ashore. 

Tanketok (Toketok), explained that a long time ago the white men came and almost exterminated the Koaluts tribe and their ancestors passed down their desire for revenge. They came to an oral agreement that the mountain aborigines would not kill any more castaways, would care for them and hand them over to the Chinese at Langqiao. Le Gendre visited the tribe again in February 1869 and signed an agreement with them in English. It was later discovered that Tanketok did not have absolute control over the tribes and some of them paid him no heed. Le Gendre castigated China as a semi-civilized power for not fulfilling the obligation of the law of nations, which is to seize the territory of a &quot;wild race&quot; and to confer upon it the benefits of civilization. Since China failed to prevent the aborigines from killing subjects or citizens of civilized countries, &quot;we see the rights of the Emperor of China over aboriginal Formosa, such as we have said, are not absolute, as long as she remains uncivilized...&quot; Le Gendre later moved to Japan and worked with the Japanese government as a foreign advisor on their China policy, including the development of the concept of the &quot;East Asian crescent&quot;. According to the &quot;East Asian crescent&quot; concept, Japan should control Korea, Taiwan, and Ryukyu to affirm its position in East Asia.

==Influence==
Following the &quot;Rover&quot; Incident in 1867, another shipwreck triggered the Mudan Incident which subsequently was the justification for the Empire of Japan to invade and occupy a part of Taiwan in 1874, a decade later the French General Jacques Duchesne defeated the Chinese up the Keelung River. In addition, the Qing court established the Hengchun lighthouse (1888; now Eluanbi Lighthouse) for the protection of the Taiwan Strait and vessels transiting the Bashi Channel.

== TV Mini Series from 2021 ==
In 2021 Public Television Service (PTS) of Taiwan has released a ten part mini-series named &quot;Seqalu: Formosa 1867&quot; (&quot; 斯卡羅&quot;) about the incident. &quot;Seqalu&quot; refers to the name of a Paiwan-Puyuma nation that existed from 1600 to 1931.

<doc id="1130649" wikidata="Q5630866" url="?curid=1130649" title="HMCS Nipigon (DDH 266)">
<text>HMCS &quot;Nipigon&quot; was an that served in the Royal Canadian Navy and later the Canadian Forces. She was the second Canadian naval unit to carry this name. Entering service in 1964, she was named for the Nipigon River that flows through Ontario.

&quot;Nipigon&quot; served throughout the Cold War on the Atlantic coast of Canada. She was paid off in 1998 and sold for use as an artificial reef off the coast of Quebec.

==Design and description==
The Royal Canadian Navy had intended to place a six ship order under the of destroyer escorts; however, during the design phase, the last two vessels ordered were altered to the DDH design and were classed under the new &quot;Annapolis&quot; designation.

The ships measured in length, with a beam of and a draught of . Initially, the ships displaced and had a complement of 228.

The ships were powered by two Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers connected to the two-shaft English-Electric geared steam turbines providing . This gave the ships a maximum speed of .

The ships were initially armed with two /50 caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in a single turret forward. The extra topweight of the helicopter required the return of the American Mk 33 3-inch gun over the heavier 3-inch/70 caliber guns used on the preceding class. The guns could fire 45 – 50 rounds per minute with a lifespan of 2,050 rounds. The guns were placed in a Mk 33 mount. The mounting allowed the guns to elevate from −15° to 85°. The elevation rate was 30° per second and train rate was 24° per second. The mounts could train 360°.

For anti-submarine warfare, the ships were armed with a Mk 10 Limbo mortar. The Limbo was a British-designed three-barrel mortar capable of launching a projectile shell between . Placed on stabilized mountings, the projectiles always entered the water at the same angle. The total weight of the shell was . They also had a Mk.4 thrower with homing torpedoes.

Initially the ships were outfitted with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar, and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For sensing below the surface, the class was given one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar, one SQS-503 hull mounted active search sonar and one SQS-504 VDS medium frequency active search sonar. For fire control purposes they were given one Mk 64 GFCS fire control with SPG-48 tracker (GUNAR).
The two &quot;Annapolis&quot;-class destroyers were built late enough to incorporate the helicopter hangar retrofitted to the &quot;St. Laurent&quot; class and the &quot;Beartrap&quot; haul-down device. This allowed the destroyer escorts to deploy with one CH-124 Sea King helicopter.

===DELEX refit===
The DEstroyer Life EXtension (DELEX) refit was born out of the need to extend the life of the steam-powered destroyer escorts of the Canadian Navy in the 1980s until the next generation of surface ship was built. Encompassing all the classes based on the initial &quot;St. Laurent&quot; (the remaining &quot;St. Laurent&quot;, , &quot;Mackenzie&quot;, and &quot;Annapolis&quot;-class vessels), the DELEX upgrades were meant to improve their ability to combat modern Soviet submarines, and to allow them to continue to operate as part of NATO task forces.

The &quot;Annapolis&quot; class received the same sensor and communications upgrades that others in the &quot;St Laurent&quot; family of ships received, including the installation of a new tactical data system (ADLIPS), updated radars and sonars, fire control and satellite navigation. They also received the new Canadian Tactical Towed Array Sensor or CANTASS which was a long-range towed sonar array that was affixed to the stern, which replaced the older VDS. The class also received a new lattice mast.

They were given torpedo tubes to allow them to fire Mark 46 torpedoes. However, the Limbo mortar was removed in order to install the CANTASS. This visibly altered the overall appearance of the ships.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Nipigon&quot; was ordered in 1958, initially as a repeat &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class vessel. However, in 1959, the last two repeat &quot;Restigouche&quot;s were altered to incorporate variable depth sonar and a helicopter landing area and became a separate class. The ship was laid down on 5 August 1960 by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel and launched on 10 December 1961. Her construction was overseen by Cdr Donald Clark CD, who also oversaw the laying-down and commencement of . She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 May 1964 with classification number 266 and with the wife of the then Governor-General Georges Vanier, Madame Pauline Vanier, as her sponsor. She was actually the first vessel to commission in the class. In 1964, the ship escorted the royal yacht on its tour of Canada.

On 18 October 1965, a fire broke out in the fuel-handling room, killing one and seriously injuring others. Two injured sailors died in a Royal Navy hospital in Plymouth, England over the next three days. Eight crew members were evacuated to .
&quot;Nipigon&quot; served most of her career with the RCN and later Canadian Forces&#x27; Atlantic Fleet. During her service with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT), she was primarily used as a training ship. After the discovery of cracks in the boilers of , all the &quot;Annapolis&quot;-class destroyers were temporarily taken out of service for an inspection in 1981. However, no cracks were discovered in &quot;Nipigon&quot;. In 1982, &quot;Nipigon&quot; was tasked with searching for and recovering any survivors from &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;, a semi-submersible oil platform that had sunk in heavy seas. &quot;Nipigon&quot;″s DELEX refit was performed by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, taking place from 27 June 1983 to 22 August 1984 and cost $16 million.

On 28 April 1985, the warship shelled and sank the fishing trawler &quot;Lady Marjorie&quot; after it had been abandoned by its crew and became a hazard to navigation. Initially the decision was questioned, but &quot;Nipigon&quot; was later cleared by a Canadian Coast Guard report. In June 1985, &quot;Nipigon&quot;, while participating in naval exercises, suffered structural damage after a stress crack sheared 215 rivets in the vessel&#x27;s superstructure. The problem was not resolved until 1986. On 27 February 1987, her CH-124 helicopter rescued crewmen from the tug &quot;Gulf Gale&quot; which had caught fire off Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The ship became the second to have a mixed-gender crew in the Canadian Forces in September 1987.

&quot;Nipigon&quot; underwent another refit, this time at Port Weller, Ontario beginning on 30 August 1988 and lasting to 16 February 1990. In August 1991, the destroyer was deployed to STANAVFORLANT, the standing NATO fleet. In May 1993, &quot;Nipigon&quot; took part in commemorative events remembering the Battle of the Atlantic in Liverpool and off the Welsh coast. In 1995, &quot;Nipigon&quot; was deployed into the Atlantic as a guard ship during the Turbot War. In June 1995, the destroyer intercepted the Spanish fishing vessel &quot;Patricia Nores&quot;, and boarded her just outside Canada&#x27;s exclusive economic zone. Eleven tonnes of unrecorded turbot catch was found aboard &quot;Patricia Nores&quot; in a secret compartment.

She was decommissioned from the Canadian Forces on 2 July 1998 and sold for use as an artificial reef. She was sunk in the St. Lawrence River north-east of Rimouski, Quebec on 22 July 2003.

<text>Beagle 3 (also called Beagle 2: Evolution) was a proposed Mars lander mission to search for life on Mars, past or present. &quot;Beagle 3&quot; was the proposed successor to the failed British &quot;Beagle 2&quot; Mars lander, with which communication was lost. &quot;Beagle 3&quot; was promoted by Professor Colin Pillinger, lead scientist on the &quot;Beagle 2&quot;. EADS Astrium also played a part in funding and early development of the project. Pillinger dreamed of launching up to two landing craft from an orbiter in 2009 as part of the European Space Agency&#x27;s Aurora Programme. The putative &quot;Beagle 3&quot; would be named after the ship HMS Beagle that took Charles Darwin around the world.

After the &quot;Beagle 3&quot; project was rejected by ESA in 2004, Pillinger proposed to the NASA to hitch a ride on the Mars Science Laboratory Mars lander, but the proposal was not accepted.

One of the goals of Beagle 3 was to support the ESA Aurora programme if chosen.

== Proposed payload ==
* Advanced solar cell technology, meaning two disc-shaped solar arrays (as opposed to the previous four)
* A gas analysis package (Gap) to test soil and rock for biosignatures and biomolecules
* Powerful X-band (8.0 to 12.0 GHz) antenna for direct vehicle-to-Earth radio link on the vehicle&#x27;s main shell, to provide real-time descent data.
* New lithium-ion battery technology—to be able to operate at lower temperatures, meaning less power wasted on heating—a possible 60% capacity boost to that of &quot;Beagle 2&quot;.
* Deadbeat airbags, which inflate just before touch-down, and gently deflate during landing, so that the probe could come to a stop where it lands, and not bounce to a stop.
* &quot;Life-chips&quot;, which detect the presence of amino acids.

==Impact of Beagle 2 discovery==
Beagle 2 was found in 2015, which overturned a previous theory that it hit thin air and collided with Mars at high speed, however it was not known for sure because it did not transmit any data during descent. When the Beagle 2 leader tried to raise money for Beagle 3, the EDL system used on Beagle 2 was an unknown. However, after its discovery there was realization that the EDL must have worked as it was found on the surface with several panels deployed, even though it did not transmit.

One of the goals of Beagle 3 was to use lessons learned from Beagle 2 to improve the spacecraft, and also take advantage of newer technology. However, since it was not clear what happened to Beagle 2, it was not obvious what should be changed.

<doc id="1130657" wikidata="Q1190344" url="?curid=1130657" title="Red states and blue states">
<text>Starting with the 2000 United States presidential election, the terms &quot;red state&quot; and &quot;blue state&quot; have referred to US states whose voters vote predominantly for one party—the Republican Party in red states and the Democratic Party in blue states—in presidential and other statewide elections. By contrast, states where the predominant vote fluctuates between Democratic and Republican candidates are known as &quot;swing states&quot; or &quot;[[purple states]]&quot;. Examining patterns within states reveals that the reversal of the two parties&#x27; geographic bases has happened at the state level, but it is more complicated locally, with urban-rural divides associated with many of the largest changes.

All states contain both liberal and conservative voters (i.e., they are &quot;purple&quot;) and only appear blue or red on the electoral map because of the winner-take-all system used by most states in the Electoral College. However, the perception of some states as &quot;blue&quot; and some as &quot;red&quot;, based on plurality or majority support for either main party, was reinforced by a degree of partisan stability from election to election—from the 2016 presidential election to the 2020 presidential election, only five states changed &quot;color&quot;; and as of 2020, the largest voting block in 35 out of 50 states have voted for the same party in every presidential election since the red-blue terminology was popularized in 2000, with only 15 having swung between the 2000 presidential election and the 2020 election. Although many red states and blue states stay in the same category for long periods, they may switch from blue to red or from red to blue over time.

==History of the color schematics==
===Origins===
The colors red and blue are also featured on the United States flag. Traditional political mapmakers, at least throughout the 20th century, had used blue to represent the modern-day Republicans, as well as the earlier Federalist Party. This may have been a holdover from the Civil War, during which the predominantly Republican north was considered However, at that time, a maker of widely sold maps accompanied them with blue pencils to mark Confederate force movements, while red was for the Union.

Later, in the 1888 presidential election, Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison used maps that coded blue for the Republicans, the color perceived to represent the Union and &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Party&quot;, and red for the Democrats. The parties themselves had no official colors, with candidates variously using either or both of the national color palette of red and blue (white being unsuitable for printed materials).

There was one historical use, associated with boss rule, of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans: during the late 19th century and early 20th century, Texas county election boards used color-coding to help Spanish-speaking and illiterate voters identify the parties; however, this system was not applied consistently in Texas and was not replicated in any other state. In 1908, &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed a special color map, using blue for Democrats and yellow for Republicans, to detail Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s 1904 electoral victory. That same year, a color supplement included with a July issue of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; used red for Republican-favoring states, blue for Democratic-favoring states, yellow for &quot;doubtful&quot; states and green for territories that did not have a presidential vote.

===Contrast with other/original color usage and in other countries===

The 21st-century association of colors in American politics is contrary to the long-standing conventions of political color in most other countries whereby red symbols (such as the red flag or red star) are associated with leftist politics including &quot;red states&quot; (original term in USA) with such governments, such as Red China, whereas blue is associated with conservatism. As late as the 1990s, Democrats were often represented by red and Republicans by blue. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, journalist Tim Russert invented these terms during his televised coverage of the 2000 United States presidential election. The 2000 election was not the first during which the news media used colored maps to depict voter preferences in the various states, but it was the first time the current red-blue terminology was used. In previous elections, the color assignments or even the actual colors used were often different.

===History of current designations===
The advent of color television in America during the late 1950s and early 1960s prompted television news reporters to rely on color-coded electoral maps, though sources conflict as to the conventions they used. One source claims that in the elections prior to 2000 every state that voted for Democratic candidates but one had been coded red. It further claims that from 1976 to 2004, in an attempt to avoid favoritism in color-coding, the broadcast networks standardized the convention of alternating every four years between blue and red the color used for the incumbent president&#x27;s party.

According to another source, in 1976, John Chancellor, the anchorman for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, asked his network&#x27;s engineers to construct a large illuminated map of the United States. The map was placed in the network&#x27;s election-night news studio. If Jimmy Carter, the Democratic candidate that year, won a state, it was lit in red whereas if Gerald Ford, the incumbent Republican president, won a state, it was lit It was said that Roy Wetzel, then the newly minted general manager of NBC’s election unit, justified the color scheme of blue for Republicans and red for Democrats for a simple reason: &quot;Great Britain. Without giving it a second thought, we said blue for conservatives, because that’s what the parliamentary system in London is, red for the more liberal party. And that settled it. We just did it. Forget all that communist red stuff. It didn’t occur to us. When I first heard it, I thought, ‘Oh, that’s really The feature proved to be so popular that, four years later, all three major television networks used colors to designate the states won by the presidential candidates, though not all using the same color scheme. NBC continued its color scheme (blue for Republicans) NBC newsman David Brinkley referred to the 1980 election map outcome showing Republican Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 44-state landslide in blue as resembling a &quot;suburban 

Since the 1984 election, CBS has used the opposite scheme: blue for Democrats, red for Republicans. ABC used yellow for Republicans and blue for Democrats in 1976, then red for Republicans and blue for Democrats in 1980, 1984, and 1988. In 1980, when John Anderson had a relatively well publicized campaign as an independent candidate, at least one network indicated provisionally that they would use yellow if he were to win a state. Similarly, at least one network would have used yellow to indicate a state won by Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996, though neither of them did claim any states in any of these years.

By 1996, color schemes were relatively mixed, as CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to Democratic states with the color blue and Republican ones as red, while &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; used the opposite scheme. 

In the days after the 2000 election, the outcome of which was unknown for some time after election day, major media outlets began conforming to the same color scheme because the electoral map was continually in view, and conformity made for easy and instant viewer comprehension. On election night that year, there was no coordinated effort to code Democratic states blue and Republican states red; the association gradually emerged. Partly as a result of this eventual and near-universal color-coding, the terms &quot;red states&quot; and &quot;blue states&quot; entered popular use in the weeks after the 2000 presidential election. After the results were final with the Republican George W. Bush winning, journalists stuck with the color scheme, as &quot;The Atlantic&quot;&#x27;s December 2001 cover story by David Brooks entitled, &quot;One Nation, Slightly Divisible&quot;, illustrated.

Thus, red and blue became fixed in the media and in many people&#x27;s minds, despite the fact that the Democratic and Republican parties had not officially chosen colors. Some Republicans argue the GOP should retain its historic association with blue, since most center-right parties worldwide are associated with blue. On March 14, 2014, the California Republican Party officially rejected red and adopted blue as its color. Archie Tse, &quot;The New York Times&quot; graphics editor who made the choice when the &quot;Times&quot; published its first color presidential election map in 2000, provided a nonpolitical rationale for retaining the red–Republican link, explaining that &quot;Both &#x27;Republican&#x27; and &#x27;red&#x27; start with the letter &#x27;R.&#x27;&quot;

==Map interpretation==
There are several problems in creating and interpreting election maps. Popular vote data are necessarily aggregated at several levels, such as counties and states, which are then colored to show election results. Maps of this type are termed choropleth maps, which have several well-known problems that can result in interpretation bias. One problem occurs when areal units differ in size and significance, as is the case with election maps. These maps give extra visual weight to larger areal units, whether by county or state. This problem is compounded if the units are not equally significant. A large county or state in area may have fewer voters than a small one in area, for example. Some maps attempt to account for this by using cartogram methods, but the resulting distortion can make such maps difficult to read. Another problem relates to data classification. Election maps often use a two-class color scheme (red and blue), which results in a map that is easy to read but is very generalized. Some maps use more classes, such as shades of red and blue to indicate the degree of election victory. These maps provide a more detailed picture but themselves have various problems associated with classification of data. The cartographer must choose how many classes to use and how to divide the data into those classes. While there are various techniques available, the choice is essentially arbitrary. The look of a map can vary significantly depending on the classification choices. The choices of color and shading likewise affect the map&#x27;s appearance. Further, all election maps are subject to the interpretation error known as the ecological fallacy.

Finally, there are problems associated with human perception. Large areas of color appear more saturated than small areas of the same color. A juxtaposition of differing colors and shades can result in contrast misperceptions. For example, due to the simultaneous contrast effect, the Bezold effect, and other factors, an area shaded light red surrounded by areas shaded dark red will appear even lighter. Differing shades of red and blue compound this effect.

Cartographers have traditionally limited the number of classes so that it is always obvious which class a color shade represents. Some election maps, however, have violated this tradition by simply coloring each areal unit with a red-blue mixture linked to voting ratio data—resulting in an &quot;unclassified choropleth map&quot;. These &quot;purple maps&quot; are useful for showing the highly mixed nature of voting, but are extremely difficult to interpret in detail. The lack of clear classes make these purple maps prone to the problems of color perception described above. However, there are pros and cons to both classified and unclassified choropleth maps. Each tend to show some patterns well while obscuring others. All these facts should be taken into account when looking at election maps.

===Critiques===
The paradigm has been criticized on several fronts. Many argue that assigning partisanship to states is only really useful as it pertains to the Electoral College, as well as (more recently) the Senate, primarily a winner-take-all system of elections (with the exceptions of Nebraska and Maine).

The Democratic or Republican party of a particular state may have policies that depart—sometimes greatly—from those of the national party, sometimes causing that state to favor one party in state and local elections and the other in presidential elections. This is most evident in the Southern United States, where the state Democratic Party organizations tend to be more conservative than the national party, especially on social issues. Likewise, Republicans have elected many statewide officeholders in states that vote strongly Democratic in presidential elections, such as Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland, Vermont, and New Jersey, generally by running closer to the political center.

The elections in Arkansas as well as West Virginia in 2004 were won by Republican President George W. Bush, but Democrats at the time held all four U.S. Senate seats and majorities of elected executive officeholders in those states, including the governorship of the latter. Similarly, Tennessee was won by Bush in both 2000 and 2004, but going into 2004, its governor was a Democrat and both chambers of the state legislature were controlled by Democrats as well. The converse can also be true, as in the case of Maine, which had two Republican U.S. senators, but Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry won the state&#x27;s electoral votes. Likewise, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Hawaii all voted for Democrat Kerry by wide margins, but all had Republican governors at the time.

In his address before the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, Barack Obama spoke on the issue of blue states and red states, saying: &quot;The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states—red states for Republicans, and blue states for Democrats. But I&#x27;ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don&#x27;t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states. … We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the Stars and Stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.&quot;

In April 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain predicted that the presidential election that November would not follow the red-state-blue-state pattern, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that the old red state, blue state scenario that prevailed for the last several elections works. I think most of these states that we have either red or blue are going to be up for grabs.&quot; Arguably, this eventually proved to be somewhat true, but not in McCain&#x27;s favor as Obama won three &quot;red&quot; states that had not voted Democratic in many years, namely Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana along with a part of deep red Nebraska, via the state&#x27;s (much less conservative as a whole) second congressional district. Obama also came close to winning Missouri and Montana, losing both by a small margin. The only deviations from the preexisting red-blue paradigm were all in Obama&#x27;s favor. In the three presidential elections since 2008, Indiana and North Carolina went back to supporting Republicans. Virginia has continued voting for the Democratic presidential nominees (as well as increasingly electing Democrats at the state level), leading to its being reclassified as a blue state in recent years. Nebraska&#x27;s 2nd district flipped back into the Republican column in 2012 and 2016, but supported the Democrats in 2020 and 2024.

==Purple states==

A purple state refers to a swing state where both Democratic and Republican candidates receive many votes without an overwhelming majority for either party. Purple states are also often referred to as &quot;battleground&quot; states.

The demographic and political applications of the terms have resulted in a temptation to presume this arbitrary classification is a definite and fundamental cultural division. Given the general nature and common perception of the two parties, &quot;red state&quot; implies a conservative region or a more conservative American, and &quot;blue state&quot; implies a more liberal region or a more liberal American. But the distinction between the two groups of states is less simplistic. The analysis that suggests political, cultural and demographic differences between the states is more accurate when applied to smaller geographical areas.

Traditionally, the practice of designating a U.S. state as red or blue is based on the first-past-the-post winner-take-all system employed for presidential elections by 48 of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Electoral law in Maine and Nebraska makes it possible for those states to divide their electoral votes: winner-take-all both by congressional district and statewide.

Despite the prevalent winner-take-all practice, the minority party almost always gets a sizable vote, with the most strongly partisan states typically having 25% to 40% of the population vote for the losing party in a presidential election. Most states have strongly Democratic cities as well as strongly Republican rural areas.

Robert Vanderbei at Princeton University made the first &quot;Purple America&quot; map after the 2000 presidential election. It attempts to represent the margin of victory in each county by coloring each with a shade between true blue and true red. Due to the general absence of overwhelming victories, this technique results in mostly shades of purple. After the 2004 election, Vanderbei and then others made similar maps summarizing the results. Quickly thereafter, the term &quot;Purple America&quot; entered the public lexicon as a way of stating that the United States is not as divided as the political pundits would have the people believe.

Cartograms developed by Gastner, Shalizi, and Newman at the University of Michigan provide another way to depict election results, which change from a red-blue paradigm to one of shades of purple.

Forty-four of the 50 states were consistent in voting for Donald Trump or his Democratic opponent in the 2016, 2020, and 2024 presidential elections. The exceptions were Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan – all of which voted for Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020, and Trump again in 2024; and Nevada – the only state that voted for the Democrats in 2016 and 2020 but voted for Trump in 2024. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and particularly Michigan voted in 2008 and 2012 for Obama handily, as well as having supported the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since 1988, suggesting they are gradually becoming redder. Inversely, Georgia and Arizona had supported Republican presidential candidates for decades before 2020, with Georgia last voting blue in 1992 and Arizona in 1996. This suggests that Georgia and Arizona are gradually becoming bluer.

Some states did not switch parties in 2016, 2020 or 2024, yet are/were still relatively even and often considered swing states. These include North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and New Hampshire. Occasionally, swing state maps might include Minnesota, Maine, Virginia and Texas, which generally vote for one party (Minnesota, Maine and Virginia generally Democratic; Texas generally Republican) but still often see close elections.

==Polarization==

Feelings of cultural and political polarization between red and blue states, which have gained increased media attention since the 2004 election, have resulted in increased mutual feelings of alienation and enmity. The polarization has been present for only four close elections (2000, 2004, 2016, and 2020). One trend that has been true for several election cycles is that states that vote Republican tend to be more rural and more sparsely populated (thus having fewer electoral votes) than states that vote Democratic. Polarization is more evident on a county scale with the growing percentage of the U.S. electorate living in &quot;landslide counties&quot;, counties where the popular vote margin between the Democratic and Republican candidate is 20 percentage points or greater.

In 1976, only 27 percent of U.S. voters lived in landslide counties, which increased to 39 percent by 1992. Nearly half of U.S. voters resided in counties that voted for George W. Bush or John Kerry by 20 percentage points or more in 2004. In 2008, 48 percent of U.S. voters lived in such counties, which increased further to 50 percent in 2012 and to 61 percent in 2016. In 2020, 58 percent of U.S. voters lived in landslide counties. At the same time, the 2020 U.S. presidential election marked the ninth presidential election where the victorious major party nominee did not win a popular vote majority by a double-digit margin over the losing major party nominee(s), continuing the longest sequence of such presidential elections in U.S. history that began in 1988 and in 2016 eclipsed the previous longest sequence from 1876 through 1900.

===Red-state/blue-state secession===
Various editorials have proposed that states of the U.S. secede and then form federations only with states that have voted for the same political party. These editorials note the increasingly polarized political strife in the U.S. between Republican voters and Democratic voters. They propose partition of the U.S. as a way of allowing both groups to achieve their policy goals while reducing the chances of civil war. 

A 2021 poll found that 52% of Trump voters and 41% of Biden voters support partitioning the United States into multiple countries based on political party lines. A different poll that same year grouped the United States into five geographic regions, and found that 37% of Americans favored secession of their own region. 44% of Americans in the South favored secession, with Republican support at 66%; while Democratic support was 47% in the Pacific states.

==Demographics==
Although the Electoral College determines the presidential election, a more precise measure of how the country actually voted may be better represented by either a county-by-county or a district-by-district map. By breaking the map down into smaller units (including many blue counties lying next to red counties), these maps tend to display many states with a purplish hue, thus demonstrating that an ostensibly blue or red state may, in fact, be closely divided. Note that election maps of all kinds are subject to errors of interpretation.

===Urban versus rural===
These county-by-county and district-by-district maps reveal that the true nature of the divide is between urban areas and inner suburbs versus rural and exurban areas. In the 2020 election, most voters in most rural counties voted for Republican Donald Trump. Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, all states Biden won statewide, are good examples of this with some exceptions. Inversely, in solidly red states, most voters in most urban counties voted for Democrat Joe Biden; good examples for this would be Orleans Parish, Louisiana, and Davidson County, Tennessee (the locations of major U.S. cities New Orleans and Nashville, respectively). Both provided Biden with double-digit margins of victory over Trump. An even more detailed precinct-by-precinct breakdown demonstrates that in many cases, large cities voted for Biden, and their suburbs were divided.

==Reaction==
===United States===
The &quot;Democratic blue&quot; and &quot;Republican red&quot; color scheme is now part of the lexicon of American journalism.

Neither party national committee has officially accepted these color designations, though informal use by each party is becoming common. Both parties have since adopted logos that use their respective colors (a blue &quot;D&quot; for Democrats and a red &quot;GOP&quot; for Republicans). National conventions for both major parties increasingly feature the parties&#x27; respective colors, from the colors emphasized on convention podiums to the color conventioneers can be seen wearing on the delegate floor. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also alluded to the color scheme when it launched a national &quot;Red to Blue Program&quot; in 2006.

The scheme has found acceptance and implementation from the U.S. federal government as the Federal Election Commission report for the 2004 presidential election uses the red-Republican and blue-Democratic scheme for its electoral map.
===International===
The choice of colors in this divide may appear counter-intuitive to non-American observers, as in most countries, red is associated with socialist, communist, or social democratic parties, while blue is associated with conservative (especially liberal conservative) parties. For example, the major center-right conservative parties in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Italy, Spain, France and Bavaria, all use blue or its shades (whether officially or unofficially) whereas the major socialist, communist, or social democratic parties in each country are associated with red (orange in Canada). If the U.S. followed such a pattern, blue would be used for the Republicans and red for the Democrats. However, the current U.S. scheme has become so ingrained in the American election system that foreign sources who cover U.S. elections, such as the BBC, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;El Mundo&quot; follow with the red-Republican, blue-Democratic scheme for U.S. elections.

==Usage elsewhere==
===Australia===

In Australia, the center-right Liberal Party uses the color blue, while the center-left Labor Party uses the color red. The formal alliance between the two main center-right political parties in Australia, the Liberal Party and National Party), known as the Coalition, also uses blue (although the National Party itself uses dark green). While the terminology used in the United States is sometimes used in Australia, the terms &quot;Liberal state&quot; (or &quot;Coalition state&quot;) and &quot;Labor state&quot; are generally used instead.

As the Coalition is dominant in regional and rural areas, states where over 40% of the population live outside the state capital typically have higher numbers of Coalition supporters.

However, state politics and federal politics are separate and many states vote for different parties in state and federal elections. While Queensland and Western Australia have Labor governments, federally both states have almost always voted for the Coalition, although the latter has shifted to Labor more recently on both a state and federal level. The Northern Territory, which also has a Labor government, has also historically voted primarily for the Coalition. Tasmania has also been an important state for both parties over the past 50 years because, of the five Tasmanian seats in the House of Representatives, there have been times where one party has won all five of them. As of the 2022 Australian federal election, the Liberals have two Tasmanian seats (Bass and Braddon), as does Labor (Franklin and Lyons), the remaining seat (Clark) being represented by independent Andrew Wilkie. Queensland and Tasmania were considered the two states that delivered Scott Morrison&#x27;s unpredicted win at the 2019 federal election and both states are the only two where less than 50% of the population resides in the capital city (Brisbane and Hobart, respectively), which is important due to the Coalition&#x27;s dominance in regional Australia.

Of the 29 federal elections held since 1949, Labor has won the federal two-party-preferred vote in Queensland just three times: in 1961, 1990 and 2007 (when Queenslander Kevin Rudd was leader of the Labor Party); and in Western Australia just six times: in 1969, 1983, 1984, 1987, 2001 (when Western Australian Kim Beazley was Labor leader) and 2022. Conversely, in the Australian Capital Territory, which is dominated by national capital Canberra, Labor has won the two-party-preferred vote in every election except the 1975 election.

In Australia, the leader of the party that forms government (wins a majority of seats in the House of Representatives) becomes Prime Minister, who does not always win the primary vote or even the two-party-preferred vote (although the later scenario is rare for federal elections, last occurring in 1998).

<text>The Horlick Mountains () are a mountain group in the Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica, lying eastward of Reedy Glacier and including the Wisconsin Range, Long Hills and Ohio Range.
==Discovery and naming==
The mountains were discovered in two observations by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1933–35, one by Kennett L. Rawson from a position in about , at the end of his southeastern flight of November 22, 1934, and another by Quin Blackburn in December 1934, from positions looking up Leverett Glacier and Albanus Glacier. Portions of the Wisconsin Range are recorded in aerial photography obtained by United States Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47. 
The entire mountain group was surveyed by USARP parties and was mapped from United States Navy aerial photographs, 1959–64. 
They were named by Admiral Richard E. Byrd for William Horlick, of the Horlick&#x27;s Malted Milk Corp., a supporter of the Byrd expedition of 1933–35.

==Extent==

According to Mirsky&#x27;s 1969 geologic map of the Horlick Mountains, the Horlick Mountains extend eastward from the mouth of the Reedy Glacier to Iversen Peak at the eastern tip of the Ohio Range, about , and include the Wisconsin Range, Long Hills and Ohio Range.
A 2005 map by Davis and Blankenship shows the Horlick Mountains including the eastern part of the Queen Maud Mountains and most of the Wisconsin Range.
To their east the Hercules Dome separates the Horlick Mountains from the Thiel Mountains to the east.

==Major glaciers==

*Reedy Glacier (), a major glacier in Antarctica, over long and wide, descending from the polar plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Michigan Plateau and Wisconsin Range in the Transantarctic Mountains. It marks the limits of the Queen Maud Mountains on the west and the Horlick Mountains on the east.
*Horlick Ice Stream (), a large ice stream on the featureless ice surface to the north of the main mass of the Horlick Mountains, draining west-southwestward, paralleling these mountains, to enter the lower portion of the Reedy Glacier.
*Shimizu Ice Stream () is an ice stream in the Horlick Mountains, draining west-northwest from the area between Wisconsin Range and Long Hills to enter the south flank of Horlick Ice Stream.

==Ranges==
*Wisconsin Range (), is a major mountain range of the Horlick Mountains, comprising the Wisconsin Plateau and numerous glaciers, ridges and peaks bounded by the Reedy Glacier, Shimizu Ice Stream, Horlick Ice Stream and the interior ice plateau.
*Long Hills (), a group of hills and rock outcroppings about in extent, located midway between the Wisconsin Range and the Ohio Range.
*Ohio Range (), a range about long and wide, extending west-southwest – east-northeast from Eldridge Peak to Mirsky Ledge. The range forms the northeast end of the Horlick Mountains and consists primarily of a large snow-topped plateau with steep northern cliffs and several flat-topped ridges and mountains. The highest point, , is the summit of Mount Schopf.

<text>was a Japanese citizen who was kidnapped while touring Iraq and later beheaded on 29 October 2004 by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s group, al-Qaeda in Iraq. He was the first Japanese person beheaded in Iraq.

==Early life and education==
Koda&#x27;s parents, Setsuko Koda and Masumi Koda, were members of the United Church of Christ. Due to Koda&#x27;s family affiliation with the United Church of Christ, a cross tattoo was inscribed upon his arm. The family was from Nōgata, Fukuoka, a small southern city in Japan, and his mother was a nurse. Koda dropped out of high school in his junior year before he started working as an interior painter until 2002.

==Kidnapping and death==
Koda left Amman on 20 October 2004. He ignored advice not to travel to Iraq, and entered the country, because he was curious as to what happened there.

Koda&#x27;s captors stated that they would &quot;treat him like his predecessors Berg and Bigley&quot; (Bigley was murdered just weeks before by the organization, before it became known as Al Qaeda in Iraq) if Japan did not withdraw its forces from Iraq within 48 hours. The Japanese government headed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi refused to comply with these demands, stating that they will not concede to terrorists.

In the video sequence of Koda&#x27;s murder, Koda sits on the American flag, his captors standing behind him. Koda&#x27;s hands are tied behind his back. He is blindfolded while a captor reads out a statement for two minutes and ten seconds. The captors then hold him down on the ground as they begin to decapitate him. Throughout the beheading, &quot;Erhaby Ana (English: I am a Terrorist)&quot;, a nasheed, is played. The video sequence ends with shots of Koda&#x27;s severed head on top of his body followed by shots of the banner of al-Qaeda in Iraq. His body was found in Baghdad on 30 October wrapped in an American flag.

==Aftermath==
Koda&#x27;s body was returned to Japan. He was given a Christian funeral. The events provoked mixed responses in Japan; while many Japanese citizens were angered and appalled by the murder, some blamed the victim for not heeding the travel advisory and others criticized the Koizumi administration.

<text>The Wisconsin Range () is a major mountain range of the Horlick Mountains in Antarctica, comprising the Wisconsin Plateau and numerous glaciers, ridges and peaks bounded by the Reedy Glacier, Shimizu Ice Stream, Horlick Ice Stream and the interior ice plateau.
==Discovery and naming==
The Wisconsin Range was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1959–64. 
It was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, which has sent numerous researchers to Antarctica.

The first air photographs of the Wisconsin Range were taken by United States Navy Taskforce 68 during Operation Highjump in 1946–47.
In 1958 an oversnow tractor train drove from Byrd Station in West Antarctica to a temporary station on the Ross Ice Shelf. From there, William E. Long and F. Darling walked south to the Wisconsin Range escarpment and gathered samples of granitic rock from Mount LeSchack.
In 1964–65 Gunter Faure and John H. Mercer led a group of geologists from what is now the Byrd Polar Research Center of Ohio State University to study the Wisconsin Range and the Long Hills, using snowmobiles and three United States Army helicopters to access all parts of the area.
In 1990–91 a team using a Twin Otter airplane sampled basement rocks in the Wisconsin Range.

==Location==
The Wisconsin Range is east of the Reedy Glacier and south of the Horlick Ice Stream and the Shimizu Ice Stream. The Wisconsin Plateau is in the southeast of the range.
The southeast of the range borders the west of the Wisconsin Plateau and overlooks the Olentangy Glacier.
From south to north it includes Polygon Spur, Tillite Spur, Red Spur and Mount Huckaby.
The southern massif lies between Olentangy Glacier and Norfolk Glacier both tributaries of the Reedy Glacier.
It includes Mount McNaughton, Mount Bolton, Goodwin Peak, Haworth Mesa and Sisco Mesa.
The Wisconsin Range covers about when it is taken to also include the Watson Escarpment south of the Kansas Glacier, the Quartz Hills, the Caloplaca Hills and the Cleveland Mesa, all in the Queen Maud Mountains to the west of the Reedy Glacier.

The southwest part of the range includes Mount Soyat, Mickler Spur and Mount Sweatt between Norfolk Glacier and Hueneme Glacier, another tributary of Reedy Glacier.
It includes Griffith Peak, Mount Frontz and Mount Vito to the north of Hueneme Glacier.
The central portion of the range extends from west to east and includes Brinton Nunatak, the Ford Nunataks, Martens Peak, Murtaugh Peak, Mount Miashew, Faure Peak, Walters Peak and Lentz Buttress.
The Gierloff Nunataks, McCrilliss Nunatak and Gibbon Nunatak are north of the central portion.
The north of the range is north of the Davisville Glacier, a tributary of the Horlick Ice Stream, and mostly south of the Quonset Glacier, a tributary of the Davisville Glacier that rises in Perkins Canyon.
From west to east in includes Saunders Rock, Feeley Peak, Sheets Peak, Moran Buttress, Koopman Peak and Ruseski Buttress.
Isolated features to the north of Quonset Glacier include, from west to east, Spiers Nunatak, Garczynski Nunatak, Baker Nunatak, Mount Brecher, Angus Nunatak, Mount LeSchack, Spencer Nunatak and Widich Nunatak.

Portions of the Wisconsin Range are recorded in aerial photography obtained by United States Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47.
The Horlick Mountains, including the Wisconsin Range, were completely surveyed by United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) parties, and was mapped from United States Navy aerial photographs, 1959–64.

<text>The Ohio Range () is a range in the Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica. 
It is about long and wide, extending west-southwest – east-northeast from Eldridge Peak to Mirsky Ledge. 
The range forms the northeast end of the Horlick Mountains and consists primarily of a large snow-topped plateau with steep northern cliffs and several flat-topped ridges and mountains. The highest point, , is the summit of Mount Schopf.
==Exploration and naming==
The range was surveyed in 1958–59 by the United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) Horlick Mountains Traverse.
In October 1958 William E. Long (for whom the Long Hills are named) made a round trip by air from the Byrd Station in West Antarctica over the Wisconsin Range, Ohio Range, Thiel Mountains and Whitmore Mountains. 
Long noted that the Ohio Range has a thick layer of stratified rocks.
Later a tractor train visited the base of Mount Glossopteris, where four of the party climbed the mountain and collected samples of rock and fossils.
The range was investigated in 1960–61 and 1961–62 by geologists of the Institute of Polar Studies of Ohio State University, for which the range is named.

==Location==
Features of the east of the Ohio Range, from west to east, include Eldridge Peak, Vann Peak, Knox Peak, Lackey Ridge, Bennett Nunataks, Darling Ridge and Tuning Nunatak. 
The Buckeye Table runs along the south of the central part.
To its north are Ricker Canyon, Schulthess Bluff, Higgins Canyon, Treves Butte, Discovery Ridge and Mount Glossopteris.
In the east Mount Schopf is surrounded by Terrace Ridge, Mercer Ridge and Skinner Peak.
Mirsky Ledge is in the extreme east, with Urbanak Peak and Iverson Peak.
A blue ice field on the west of the Treves Butte, , has been reviewed as a runway for wheeled aircraft.
It is not considered promising.

A broad rock ridge with a rather flat summit area. 
It projects northwest from Buckeye Table, northwest of Mount Glossopteris. 
The name was suggested by William E. Long, geologist of the Ohio State University expedition to the Horlick Mountains in 1960–61 and 1961–62. 
The first tillite and the first Devonian brachiopods were discovered by the expedition on this ridge, hence the name.

===Otago Spur===
A small spur projecting northward from the Buckeye Table, west of Discovery Ridge, Ohio Range. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy aerial photographs, 1958–59. 
The spur was studied by a NZARP geological party, 1983-84, and named after Otago University, the alma mater of Jonathan Aitchison, a member of the field party.

Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy aerial photographs, 1958–59. 
The spur is named after the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, N.Z., home of the National Antarctic Exhibition, Research and Reference Center. 
Geologists Jane Newman and Margaret Bradshaw of the Canterbury Museum worked on this ridge during the 1984–85 field season.

===Museum Ledge===
The ledge is a flat sandstone bed about long and wide exposed by erosion. 
The feature is a fossil locality. 
It contains excellently displayed fossil wood and is located on the southwest shoulder of Mount Glossopteris. 
The name alludes to the display of fossil wood found here and was suggested by William E. Long, geologist with the Ohio State University expedition who worked in these mountains in the 1960–61 and 1961–62 austral summers.

===Salient Nunatak===
A prominent cusp-shaped nunatak which stands out from the north side of Ohio Range, northeast of Mount Glossopteris.

Schopf was a member of the Horlick Mountains Party in the 1961–62 season.

===Terrace Ridge===
A mostly ice-free ridge, or spur, descending northwest from the summit area at the south end of Mount Schopf in the Ohio Range. 
Resistant sandstone strata predominate in the lower half of the slope of the ridge, forming a series of partly ice-covered terraces separated by scarps. 
The descriptive name was suggested by geologists of the Ohio State University expedition who worked in these mountains in the 1960–61 and 1961–62 seasons.

===Mercer Ridge===
A prominent, partly ice-free ridge that forms the southwest end of Mount Schopf. 
Named by US-ACAN after John H. Mercer (1922–87), glacial geologist, a member of the Ohio State University expedition to the Horlick Mountains in 1960–61. 
He returned to work in the Horlick Mountains, 1964–65, and later worked in the Antarctic, Alaska, Greenland, Argentina, Chile, and Peru; with the Institute of Polar Studies (now Byrd Research Center), Ohio State University, 1966–87.

<doc id="1130683" wikidata="Q5241414" url="?curid=1130683" title="David Zimmer">
<text>David Zimmer (born April 7, 1944) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was the Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Willowdale from 2003 to 2018. He served in the cabinet of Kathleen Wynne, succeeding Wynne herself as the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs in 2013 (restyled Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation in 2016) for the full five years and four months length of the Wynne Ministry&#x27;s.

==Background==
Zimmer was born in Kitchener, Ontario. He attended University of Ottawa Law School and was called to the Bar of Ontario. 

From 1982 to 1984 Zimmer was Director of the Humane Society and from 1993 to 1995 was President of the Alzheimer Society of Canada. He also served as an administrative law instructor in the Law Society&#x27;s Bar Admission Course.

In 1994, Zimmer was appointed by the federal government to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada as its assistant deputy chairman heading the Toronto office, and was shortlisted for the national chairmanship in 1999. In 2001, he was appointed chairperson of Toronto&#x27;s public housing provider, the Toronto Community Housing Corporation.

== Political career ==

=== Early involvement ===
He first sought elected office as an alderman in Kitchener in the 1970s but was not successful. While living in Kitchener, he was active in the Progressive Conservative Party. When the Kitchener—Wilmot provincial electoral district was created in 1975, Zimmer served as the founding president of the local PC riding association, and managed the 1981 campaign for the local PC candidate Alan Barron. He left the PC Party and joined the Liberals in 1985 , citing disenchantment with both federal leader Brian Mulroney and provincial leader Frank Miller.

Zimmer acted as legal counsel to candidates of both Liberal Party of Canada and Ontario Liberal Party in a number of high profile dispute prior to his election. He was legal counsel for Maurizio Bevilacqua in the two year saga following his 1988 election, where the close results were extensively contested in court and was eventually voided by the Ontario Supreme Court. He also chaired the federal party&#x27;s permanent appeal committee, overseeing numerous appeals during the 1990 leadership contest and from nomination contests prior to the party&#x27;s victory in 1993.

=== Member of Provincial Parliament for Willowdale ===
In the 2003 Ontario provincial election, Zimmer ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Willowdale, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent and sitting Minister of Municipal Affairs David Young by 1,866 votes. The contest, billed in the press as &quot;the battle of the Davids&quot;, was considered a key race to watch given Young&#x27;s profile as a possible future PC leader and Willowdale&#x27;s long history of being represented by prominent PC ministers. Willowdale was where the PC came the closest to retaining a seat within the City of Toronto in 2003. Despite the competitive contest, Zimmer maintained cordial relations with Young and Young&#x27;s predecessor Charles Harnick, both predecessors to Zimmer not only as MPP for Willowdale but also as Ministers of Aboriginal Affairs in the Progressive Conservative Ministry of Mike Harris. Zimmer fended off a challenge by high profile local councillor David Shiner in 2007, and was re-elected again 2011, and 2014, increasing his share of vote and margin of victory each time.

Between 2003 and 2011, Zimmer served as Parliamentary Assistant to Attorneys General Michael Bryant and Chris Bentley. Between 2011 and 2013, Zimmer served as Parliamentary Assistant to Kathleen Wynne, then Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. He was a member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (2003–06, 2007–11, 2012), Standing Committee on Estimates (2006–07), Standing Committee on Justice Policy (2006–11), Standing Committee on General Government (2012), Select Committee on Elections (2008–09), and Select Committee on the proposed transaction of the TMX Group and the London Stock Exchange Group (2011).

In 2004, his motion to create an &quot;Elder Abuse Awareness Day&quot; was passed with support from all parties. He also assisted former Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant with legislation to ban pit bulls in Ontario. In 2006, he sponsored a Private Member’s Bill which will suspend the driver’s license of anyone who is convicted of impaired boating. It passed with unanimous consent of all parties in the Ontario Legislature.

Zimmer was awarded the Greatest Local Hero Award by the &quot;North York Town Crier&quot; for his volunteer and community work in Willowdale. In 2005, he received a &quot;Social Work Doctors’ Colloquium&quot; Award of Merit for his work toward a just and caring society. He has also been cited for work on Ontario Municipal Board reform and the new City of Toronto Act, which gives Toronto greater power to manage its own affairs.

During Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s 2012-13 leadership election, Zimmer along with Linda Jeffrey, Reza Moridi and Mario Sergio, were the first four caucus supporters of Kathleen Wynne&#x27;s candidacy, declaring their support at Wynne&#x27;s campaign launch on November 5, 2012.

=== Minister tasked with indigenous relations &amp; reconciliation ===
In February 2013, Zimmer, who was Premier Kathleen Wynne&#x27;s parliamentary assistant in the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs, was appointed by Wynne to succeed herself as the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. Zimmer helmed the ministry, the second smallest in the government, during a period indigenous issues increasingly became a front burner, mainstream area of political discourse, rapidly gaining awareness among the voting public and unprecedent attention from the Ontario government led by Wynne and the federal administration of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Under Zimmer&#x27;s watch, the indigenous affairs ministry was thrusted into roles with much greater prominence and sensitivities while substantially expanded its scope in many of the government&#x27;s economic policy initiatives. 

Wynne placing importance on indigenous issues as both a cross-government priority and a personal priority, and her personal affinity with Zimmer for being one of her earliest backers, were among the key enablers Zimmer&#x27;s and his ministry&#x27;s success in securing significant, in some cases unprecedented, progress on many longstanding challenges. For most of his tenure, the ministry&#x27;s most senior civil servant and its chief political advisor were both long-time associates of Wynne. Zimmer oversaw Ontario&#x27;s Response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including a $250 million special investment package, close to twice the ministry&#x27;s annual budget, on an integrated suite of education, health, cultural and social services programs focused on reconciliation and addressing the legacy and negative impacts of residential schools. As part of Ontario&#x27;s response, in June 2016, his ministerial title was renamed to Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, a move later reversed when the Liberals were ousted from government.

Zimmer placed specific focus on the indigenous relationship aspect of his role. He was determined to personally visit as many of Ontario&#x27;s First Nation Communities as possible, including remote reserves in extremely poor conditions that are difficult to reach. Long long tenure as a minister with a standalone mandate meant he was able to personally represent the government in the home communities of his stakeholders. By the end of his tenure, he personally visited 129 of Ontario&#x27;s 133 First Nations. 

Zimmer held the record as Ontario&#x27;s longest serving minister for indigenous affairs until late 2023 when his successor Greg Rickford, who held the role as supplementary to various economic portfolios during different periods surpassed his record of 5 years and 4 months. Zimmer&#x27;s tenure was the longest continuous period during which the ministry had a dedicated minister at the cabinet table. His successor Greg Rickford at the height of his power was charged with leading natural resources, forestry, northern development, mines, and energy in addition to the indigenous ministry. Despite heading the most bloated cabinet in the province&#x27;s history, with six ministers minding those same resources portfolio in late 2024, Premier Ford never appointed a full time minister to the indigenous affairs ministry. As of early 2025, Zimmer remains the ministry&#x27;s last dedicated minister.

Zimmer was one of three ministers who held the same portfolio throughout Wynne&#x27;s premiership, along with finance minister Charles Sousa and north development &amp; mines minister Michael Gravelle. 

The Liberals suffered their worst result in the party&#x27;s 161-year history in 2018, and Zimmer was defeated locally in Willowdale by Progressive Conservative candidate Stan Cho, who continues Willowdale&#x27;s tradition as a ministerial seat in the Ford Ministry. 


=== Post Queen&#x27;s Park ===

Since leaving Queen&#x27;s Park, Zimmer works part time as a public affairs consultant. He resumed his volunteer role chairing the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s dispute resolution body throughout the 2020 and 2023 leadership contests, and was one of three panelists who co-led the party&#x27;s post-mortem review of its 2022 electoral defeat.

<doc id="1130688" wikidata="Q337445" url="?curid=1130688" title="Density (computer storage)">
<text>Density is a measure of the quantity of information bits that can be stored on a given physical space of a computer storage medium. There are three types of density: length (&quot;linear density&quot;) of track, area of the surface (&quot;areal density&quot;), or in a given volume (&quot;volumetric density&quot;).

Generally, higher density is more desirable, for it allows more data to be stored in the same physical space. Density therefore has a direct relationship to storage capacity of a given medium. Density also generally affects the performance within a particular medium, as well as price.

== Storage device classes ==

=== Solid state media ===
Solid state drives use flash memory to store non-volatile media. They are the latest form of mass produced storage and rival magnetic disk media. Solid state media data is saved to a pool of NAND flash. NAND itself is made up of what are called floating gate transistors. Unlike the transistor designs used in DRAM, which must be refreshed multiple times per second, NAND flash is designed to retain its charge state even when not powered up. The highest capacity drives commercially available are the Nimbus Data Exadrive© DC series drives, these drives come in capacities ranging 16TB to 100TB. Nimbus states that for its size the 100TB SSD has a 6:1 space saving ratio over a nearline HDD

=== Magnetic disk media ===
Hard disk drives store data in the magnetic polarization of small patches of the surface coating on a disk. The maximum areal density is defined by the size of the magnetic particles in the surface, as well as the size of the &quot;head&quot; used to read and write the data. In 1956 the first hard drive, the IBM 350, had an areal density of 2,000 bit/in2. Since then, the increase in density has matched Moore&#x27;s Law, reaching 1 Tbit/in2 in 2014. In 2015, Seagate introduced a hard drive with a density of 1.34 Tbit/in2, more than 600 million times that of the IBM 350. It is expected that current recording technology can &quot;feasibly&quot; scale to at least 5 Tbit/in2 in the near future. New technologies like heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) and microwave-assisted magnetic recording (MAMR) are under development and are expected to allow increases in magnetic areal density to continue.

=== Optical disc media ===
Optical discs store data in small pits in a plastic surface that is then covered with a thin layer of reflective metal. Compact discs (CDs) offer a density of about 0.90 Gbit/in2, using pits which are 0.83 micrometers long and 0.5 micrometers wide, arranged in tracks spaced 1.6 micrometers apart. DVD disks are essentially a higher-density CD, using more of the disk surface, smaller pits (0.64 micrometers), and tighter tracks (0.74 micrometers), offering a density of about 2.2 Gbit/in2. Single-layer HD DVD and Blu-ray disks offer densities around 7.5 Gbit/in2 and 12.5 Gbit/in2, respectively.

When introduced in 1982 CDs had considerably higher densities than hard disk drives, but hard disk drives have since advanced much more quickly and eclipsed optical media in both areal density and capacity per device.

=== Magnetic tape media ===
The first magnetic tape drive, the Univac Uniservo, recorded at the density of 128 bit/in on a half-inch magnetic tape, resulting in the areal density of 256 bit/in2. In 2015, IBM and Fujifilm claimed a new record for the magnetic tape areal density of 123 Gbit/in2, while LTO-6, the highest-density production tape shipping in 2015, provides an areal density of 0.84 Gbit/in2.

== Research ==
A number of technologies are attempting to surpass the densities of existing media.

IBM aimed to commercialize their Millipede memory system at 1 Tbit/in2 in 2007 but development appears to be moribund. A newer IBM technology, racetrack memory, uses an array of many small nanoscopic wires arranged in 3D, each holding numerous bits to improve density. Although exact numbers have not been mentioned, IBM news articles talk of &quot;100 times&quot; increases.

Holographic storage technologies are also attempting to leapfrog existing systems, but they too have been losing the race, and are estimated to offer 1 Tbit/in2 as well, with about 250 GB/in2 being the best demonstrated to date for non-quantum holography systems.

Other experimental technologies offer even higher densities. Molecular polymer storage has been shown to store 10 Tbit/in2. By far the densest type of memory storage experimentally to date is electronic quantum holography. By superimposing images of different wavelengths into the same hologram, in 2009 a Stanford research team achieved a bit density of 35 bit/electron (approximately 3 exabytes/in2) using electron microscopes and a copper medium.

In 2012, DNA was successfully used as an experimental data storage medium, but required a DNA synthesizer and DNA microchips for the transcoding. , DNA holds the record for highest-density storage medium. In March 2017, scientists at Columbia University and the New York Genome Center published a method known as DNA Fountain which allows perfect retrieval of information from a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA, 85% of the theoretical limit.

== Effects on performance ==
With the notable exception of NAND Flash memory, increasing storage density of a medium typically improves the transfer speed at which that medium can operate. This is most obvious when considering various disk-based media, where the storage elements are spread over the surface of the disk and must be physically rotated under the &quot;head&quot; in order to be read or written. Higher density means more data moves under the head for any given mechanical movement.

For example, we can calculate the effective transfer speed for a floppy disc by determining how fast the bits move under the head. A standard 3½-inch floppy disk spins at 300 rpm, and the innermost track is about 66 mm long (10.5 mm radius). At 300 rpm the linear speed of the media under the head is thus about 66 mm × 300 rpm = 19800 mm/minute, or 330 mm/s. Along that track the bits are stored at a density of 686 bit/mm, which means that the head sees 686 bit/mm × 330 mm/s = 226,380 bit/s (or 28.3 KB/s).

Now consider an improvement to the design that doubles the density of the bits by reducing sample length and keeping the same track spacing. This would double the transfer speed because the bits would be passing under the head twice as fast. Early floppy disk interfaces were designed for 250 kbit/s transfer speeds, but were rapidly outperformed with the introduction of the &quot;high density&quot; 1.44 MB (1,440 KB) floppies in the 1980s. The vast majority of PCs included interfaces designed for high density drives that ran at 500 kbit/s instead. These, too, were completely overwhelmed by newer devices like the LS-120, which were forced to use higher-speed interfaces such as IDE.

Although the effect on performance is most obvious on rotating media, similar effects come into play even for solid-state media like Flash RAM or DRAM. In this case the performance is generally defined by the time it takes for the electrical signals to travel through the computer bus to the chips, and then through the chips to the individual &quot;cells&quot; used to store data (each cell holds one bit).

One defining electrical property is the resistance of the wires inside the chips. As the cell size decreases, through the improvements in semiconductor fabrication that led to Moore&#x27;s Law, the resistance is reduced and less power is needed to operate the cells. This, in turn, means that less electric current is needed for operation, and thus less time is needed to send the required amount of electrical charge into the system. In DRAM, in particular, the amount of charge that needs to be stored in a cell&#x27;s capacitor also directly affects this time.

As fabrication has improved, solid-state memory has improved dramatically in terms of performance. Modern DRAM chips had operational speeds on the order of 10 ns or less. A less obvious effect is that as density improves, the number of DIMMs needed to supply any particular amount of memory decreases, which in turn means less DIMMs overall in any particular computer. This often leads to improved performance as well, as there is less bus traffic. However, this effect is generally not linear.

== Effects on price ==

Storage density also has a strong effect on the price of memory, although in this case, the reasons are not so obvious.

In the case of disk-based media, the primary cost is the moving parts inside the drive. This sets a fixed lower limit, which is why the average selling price for both of the major HDD manufacturers has been US$45–75 since 2007. That said, the price of high-capacity drives has fallen rapidly, and this is indeed an effect of density. The highest capacity drives use more platters, essentially individual hard drives within the case. As the density increases, the number of platters can be reduced, leading to lower costs.

Hard drives are often measured in terms of cost per bit. For example, the first commercial hard drive, IBM&#x27;s RAMAC in 1957, supplied 3.75 MB for $34,500, or $9,200 per megabyte. In 1989, a 40 MB hard drive cost $1200, or $30/MB. And in 2018, 4 Tb drives sold for $75, or 1.9¢/GB, an improvement of 1.5 million since 1989 and 520 million since the RAMAC. This is without adjusting for inflation, which increased prices nine-fold from 1956 to 2018.

Solid-state storage has seen a similar drop in cost per bit. In this case the cost is determined by the &quot;yield&quot;, the number of viable chips produced in a unit time. Chips are produced in batches printed on the surface of a single large silicon wafer, which is cut up and non-working samples are discarded. Fabrication has improved yields over time by using larger wafers, and producing wafers with fewer failures. The lower limit on this process is about $1 per completed chip due to packaging and other costs.

The relationship between information density and cost per bit can be illustrated as follows: a memory chip that is half the physical size means that twice as many units can be produced on the same wafer, thus halving the price of each one. As a comparison, DRAM was first introduced commercially in 1971, a 1 kbit part that cost about $50 in large batches, or about 5 cents per bit. 64 Mbit parts were common in 1999, which cost about 0.00002 cents per bit (20 microcents/bit).

<doc id="1130694" wikidata="Q3323109" url="?curid=1130694" title="Thiel Mountains">
<text>The Thiel Mountains () are isolated, mainly snow-capped mountains of the Transantarctic Mountains System, located in the Ellsworth Land region of Antarctica.
The mountain range is long, is located roughly between the Horlick Mountains and the Pensacola Mountains, and extends from Moulton Escarpment on the west to Nolan Pillar on the east.
Major components include Ford Massif (), Bermel Escarpment and a group of eastern peaks near Nolan Pillar.
==Discovery and naming==
The Thiel Mountains were observed and first positioned by the United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) Horlick Mountains Traverse Party, 1958–59. 
They were surveyed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Thiel Mountains parties of 1960–61 and 1961–62. 
They were named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after Edward C. Thiel, traverse seismologist at Ellsworth Station and the Pensacola Mountains in 1957. 
In December 1959, he made airlifted geophysical observations along the 88th meridian West, including work near these mountains. 
Thiel perished with four others in the crash of a P2V Neptune aircraft soon after take-off from Wilkes Station on November 9, 1961.

==Location==
The Thiel Mountains include the Moulton Escarpment to the northwest, which includes Chastain Peak.
To the north it contains the Ford Massif.
To the southeast is the Bermel Escarpment, the Davies Escarpment and Lewis Nunatak.
The Sontag Nunatak is some distance to the north, and the Stewart Hills are yet further north.

==Thiel aircraft refueling depot==

As of 2009, Adventure Network International/Antarctic Logistics &amp; Expeditions (ANI/ALE) was the only member of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) that provided land-based tourism activities of any extent in the Antarctic.
It was formed by a 2003 takeover of Adventure Network International by Antarctic Logistics &amp; Expeditions.
ALE/ANI maintains a fuel cache at Thiel Mountains, which provides fuel for long-distance flights and serves as a backup for Search and Rescue.

A 2002 description of the fuel depot near the Thiel Mountains said &quot;the landing strip is a flat area within view of the mountains, marked with black garbage bags filled with snow. There are a bunch of 55-gallon drums of fuel and a Canadian flag.&quot;
Visitors in December 2011 travelling in a Twin Otter from Union Glacier to the South Pole landed close to Thiel Mountains at to refuel on the way. 
The operator used to fly in fuel barrels, burning one barrel for every four delivered, but now carried the fuel barrels overland, a much more efficient approach.

==Features==
In addition to the Ford Massif and Bermel Escarpment, there are various smaller features in or near the Thiel Mountains.

===Moulton Escarpment===
A rock and ice escarpment, long, in a semi-isolated position about west of Ford Massif where it forms the western shoulder of the Thiel Mountains. 
Surveyed by the USGS Thiel Mountains party, 1960-61. 
Named by US-ACAN for Kendall N. Moulton of the Division of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation. 
As program manager of the Foundation&#x27;s Field Operation Program, Moulton made more than a dozen deployments to Antarctica in the years 1958-77.

===Chastain Peak===
A peak, , near the center of Moulton Escarpment, at the W margin of the Thiel Mountains. 
Surveyed by the USGS Thiel Mountains party, 1960-61. 
Named by US-ACAN after William W. Chastain, Aviation Structural Mechanic, United States Navy, who lost his life in the crash of a P2V Neptune aircraft soon after takeoff from Wilkes Station, Nov. 9, 1961.

===Davies Escarpment===
An east-facing ice escarpment over long, located southward of Bermel Escarpment in the southern part of the Thiel Mountains.
The feature appears to be devoid of rock outcroppings. 
The name was proposed by Peter Bermel and Arthur Ford, co-leaders of the USGS Thiel Mountains party of 1960-61. 
Named after William E. Davies, USGS geologist aboard the icebreaker &quot;Atka&quot; in the Antarctic reconnaissance cruise of 1954-55 in search of station sites for use during the International Geophysical Year.

===Lewis Nunatak===
An isolated, mainly snow-covered nunatak located about southeast of the Davies Escarpment and southwest of Nolan Pillar, at the south end of the Thiel Mountains. 
The name was proposed by Peter Bermel and Arthur Ford, co-leaders of the USGS Thiel Mountains party which surveyed the area in 1960-61. 
Named for Charles R. Lewis, USGS geologist who worked from various U.S. vessels (Wyandot, Glacier and Eastwind) in conducting research in the McMurdo Sound region and in the Balaena Islands during the 1955-56 season.

===Sonntag Nunatak===
A solitary nunatak located east-northeast of Hamilton Cliff, Ford Massif. 
The nunatak was observed on Dec. 13, 1959 by Edward Thiel and Campbell Craddock in the course of a USARP airlifted geophysical traverse along the 88th meridian West. 
The name was proposed by Thiel and Craddock for Wayne Sonntag, Operations Director at the Geophysical Institute, University of Wisconsin, 1959–61, logistics officer for the airlifted traverse.

===Stewart Hills===
Several small nunataks and snow hills rising above an otherwise featureless terrain, northeast of Ford Massif.
Observed by the USARP Horlick Mountains Traverse, 1958–59, and by Edward Thiel and Campbell Craddock in the course of an airlifted geophysical traverse, Dec. 13, 1959. 
The name was proposed by Thiel and Craddock for Prof. Duncan Stewart, geologist, Carleton College, Minnesota, whose writing and interpretation of Antarctic rock samples have contributed to knowledge of the continent.

===Hart Hills===
A line of low, mainly snow-covered hills, long, trending east-west. 
The hills are isolated, lying west of Pagano Nunatak and north of the Ford Massif of the Thiel Mountains. 
Observed by Edward Thiel and Campbell Craddock in the course of an airlifted geophysical traverse along the 88th meridian West, December 13, 1959. 
The name was proposed by them for Pembroke Hart, National Academy of Sciences staff, member of the technical panel on seismology and gravity on the U.S. National Committee for the IGY.

===Pagano Nunatak===
A notable rock nunatak with a pointed summit, high, which stands in relative isolation, east of Hart Hills and north-northeast of the Ford Massif. 
The nunatak was examined and sketched by Edward Thiel in the course of an airlifted seismic traverse along meridian 88°W in the 1959-60 season. 
Named by US-ACAN after Chief Warrant Officer Gerald Pagano (d.1981), USA, assistant for plans and operations on the staff of the Commander, U.S. Naval Support Force, Antarctica, 1960–65; staff member, Center for Polar Archives, National Archives, 1972-81.

<doc id="1130700" wikidata="Q5264362" url="?curid=1130700" title="Design paradigm">
<text>The concept of design paradigms derives from the rather ambiguous idea of paradigm originating in the sociology of science, which carries at least two main meanings:

* As models, archetypes, or quintessential examples of solutions to problems. A &#x27;paradigmatic design&#x27; in this sense, refers to a design solution that is considered by a community as being successful and influential. Usually success is associated to market share or some other measure of popularity, but this need not be the case. For instance, the eMate and other Apple Newton devices can be considered as paradigmatic because of their influence in subsequent designs, despite their commercial failure.
* As sociological paradigms, a design paradigm is the constellation of beliefs, rules, knowledge, etc. that is valid for a particular design community. Here a paradigm is not a particular solution, but rather the underlying system of ideas that causes a range of solutions to be &#x27;normal&#x27; or &#x27;obvious&#x27;. A current example is the laptop: as of 2010 the design paradigm of laptops includes a portable computer unit consisting of a QWERTY keyboard, a hinged screen, etc. Moreover, such device is assumed to be helpful in task such as education as in the One Laptop per Child project.

While the first meaning of &quot;design paradigm&quot; refers to exemplary design solutions that create &quot;design trends&quot;, the second meaning refers to what a group of people expects from a type of design solutions.

The term &quot;design paradigm&quot; is used within the design professions, including architecture, industrial design and engineering design, to indicate an archetypal solution. Thus a Swiss Army Knife is a design paradigm illustrating the concept of a single object that changes configuration to address a number of problems.

Design paradigms have been introduced in a number of books including &quot;Design Paradigms: A Sourcebook for Creative Visualization&quot; by Warren Wake, and discussed in &quot;Design Paradigms: Case Histories of Error and Judgment in Engineering&quot; but never defined by Henry Petroski. This concept is close to design pattern coined by Christopher Alexander in &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;.

Design paradigms can be used either to describe a design solution, or as an approach to design problem solving. Problem solving occurs through a process of abstraction and characterization of design solutions, with subsequent categorization into problem solving types. The approach is akin to the use of metaphor in language; metaphors are used to help explain concepts that are new or unfamiliar, and to bridge between a problem we understand and a problem we don&#x27;t. Design paradigms then can be seen as higher order metaphors; as the often three-dimensional distillation of a working relationship between parts, between groups of things, between the known and the unknown. In this sense, a bridge is a paradigm of the connection between the known and the unknown, and the functional equivalent of a physical bridge is consequently used in many fields from computer hardware to musical composition.

The design paradigms concept has proven so powerful in traditional fields of design, that it has inspired a branch of computer science, where computational analogies to design paradigms are commonly called software design patterns. Importantly however, in design professions the term &quot;design pattern&quot; usually describes a 2-dimensional structure, whereas the term &quot;design paradigm&quot; (or model) usually implies a higher order, having 3 or more dimensions.

<doc id="1130702" wikidata="Q2913098" url="?curid=1130702" title="Pensacola Mountains">
<text>The Pensacola Mountains () are a large group of mountain ranges and peaks that extend in a northeast–southwest direction in the Transantarctic Mountains System, Queen Elizabeth Land region of Antarctica.
They comprise the Argentina Range, Forrestal Range, Dufek Massif, Cordiner Peaks, Neptune Range, Patuxent Range, Rambo Nunataks and Pecora Escarpment. 
These mountain units lie astride the extensive Foundation Ice Stream and Support Force Glacier which drain northward to the Ronne Ice Shelf.

==Discovery and naming==
The Pensacola Mountains were discovered and photographed on 13 January 1956 in the course of a transcontinental nonstop plane flight by personnel of United States Navy Operation Deep Freeze I from McMurdo Sound to Weddell Sea and return. 
They were named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for the U.S. Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida, in commemoration of the historic role of that establishment in training aviators of the United States Navy. 
The mountains were mapped in detail by United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos in 1956–67.

==Geology==
The Pensacola Mountains were originally continuous with the Ventana Mountains near Bahía Blanca in Argentina, Cape Fold Belt in South Africa, the Ellsworth Mountains (West Antarctica) and the Hunter-Bowen orogeny in eastern Australia.

The Ordovician-Devonian Neptune Group rests unconformably on a Cambrian succession, and is overlain disconformably by the Dover Sandstone of the Beacon Supergroup. Within the Neptune Group is the Brown Ridge Conglomerate, Elliott Sandstone, Elbow Formation, and the Heiser Sandstone.

==Western features==
The Foundation Ice Stream flows through the western part of the range.

* Pecora Escarpment (), an irregular escarpment, long, standing southwest of Patuxent Range and marking the southernmost exposed rocks of the Pensacola Mountains.
*Patuxent Range (), a major range of the Pensacola Mountains. It comprises the Thomas Hills, Anderson Hills, Mackin Table and various nunataks and ridges bounded by the Foundation Ice Stream, Academy Glacier and the Patuxent Ice Stream.
*Rambo Nunataks (), a loose chain of nunataks which lie northwest of Patuxent Range and extend along the west side of the Foundation Ice Stream for .
*Neptune Range (), a mountain range, long, lying west-southwest of Forrestal Range in the central part of the Pensacola Mountains. The range comprises Washington Escarpment with its associated ridges, valleys and peaks, the Iroquois Plateau, the Schmidt Hills and Williams Hills.

==Northern features==
The northern part of the range is to the south of the Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf.

*Cordiner Peaks (), a group of peaks extending over an area of standing southwest of Dufek Massif in the northern part of the Pensacola Mountains.
*Dufek Massif (), a rugged, largely snow-covered massif long, standing west of the Forrestal Range in the northern part of the Pensacola Mountains.
*Forrestal Range (), a largely snow-covered mountain range, about long, standing east of Dufek Massif and the Neptune Range in the Pensacola Mountains.
*Argentina Range (), a range of rock peaks and bluffs, long, lying east of the northern part of Forrestal Range in the northeastern portion of the Pensacola Mountains.

<text>Larry Alton Parrish (born November 10, 1953) is an American former professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played in Major League Baseball and the Nippon Professional Baseball league as a third baseman from 1974 to 1990, most prominently as a member of the Montreal Expos and the Texas Rangers.

A two-time All-Star player, Parrish averaged 22 home runs and 85 runs batted in per season and hit three home runs in a game four times during his 15-year major league career. After playing one season with the Boston Red Sox, he played his final two seasons of professional baseball in Japan with the Yakult Swallows and the Hanshin Tigers.

After his playing career, Parrish continued to work in professional baseball as a coach and manager at both the major league and minor league levels. He is the winningest manager in Toledo Mud Hens history, serving as the team&#x27;s manager for a record eight seasons, highlighted by back-to-back Governors&#x27; Cup championships in 2005 and 2006. He was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame in 2013 for his career as the Mud Hens manager.

==Playing career==
Making his debut in 1974 at the age of 20, Parrish became a solid hitter as a third baseman in the 1970s and 1980s, hitting 20 or more home runs in a season 5 times during his Major League career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 1979, he was named the Montreal Expos Player of the Year after batting .307 with 30 homers and 82 runs batted in, and finishing fourth in National League MVP voting. Parrish is the only Montreal Expos player to ever hit three home runs in one game on three separate occasions (May 29, 1977, July 30, 1978, and April 25, 1980). In the May 1977 game against the Cardinals, he went 5–for–5, batting in 5 runs in a 14–4 victory. In the April 1980 game, he drove in all 7 runs for Montreal in an 8–7 loss to Atlanta.

Parrish was traded along with Dave Hostetler from the Expos to the Texas Rangers for Al Oliver on March 31, 1982. He originally was supposed to have been the Rangers&#x27; starting right fielder. In 1982, during his first season with the Rangers, Parrish tied a major league record held by Jim Northrup when he hit three grand slams in the span of one week.

Parrish ranks 15th on the Texas Rangers&#x27; all-time home run list with 149 and 14th in RBIs at 522. He closed out his American Major League career by joining the Boston Red Sox during the stretch run of the 1988 season; while he was with the Red Sox, the team won the American League Eastern Division championship.

After his Major League Baseball career ended, Parrish played for two different Japanese major league teams. Parrish had a career .263 batting average in Major League Baseball with 256 home runs and 992 runs batted in. In 13 career playoff games, he batted .182 with no home runs and three RBIs.

==Coaching career==
After retiring from the majors and spending time playing for the Yakult Swallows and Hanshin Tigers of the Japanese Central League, Parrish became a full-time coach within the Detroit Tigers organization. In 1992, Parrish was named the manager for the Single-A Niagara Falls Rapids of the New York–Penn League which won the league championship in 1993. In 1995, he was named the roving hitting instructor for the Tigers minor league system. In 1996, he returned to the dugout as the manager of the Double-A Jacksonville Suns, where he won another League Championship the same year. Parrish then served as bench coach under Tigers manager Buddy Bell for the 1997 season and part of the 1998 season before Bell was fired. Parrish was promoted as the replacement and managed the Tigers from 1998 to 1999, compiling an 82–104 record. However, he was replaced by Phil Garner for the 2000 season. Parrish managed the Tigers through their final season at Tiger Stadium. Parrish remained in the Tigers organization as a scout from 2000 to 2002, and in 2003, he returned to the dugout once again as the manager for the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League.

In 2005, Parrish managed the Mud Hens to an impressive 89–55 record and the Governors&#x27; Cup as champions of the International League. The Mud Hens defeated the Indianapolis Indians. Following the season, Parrish was named the 2005 Minor League Manager of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

In 2006, Parrish led the Mud Hens to a 76–66 record and a repeat of the Governor&#x27;s Cup, giving the Mud Hens their third title and making them back-to-back champions for the first time in team history. This time, the Mud Hens defeated the Rochester Red Wings. The team moved on to play in the first Triple-A Baseball National Championship Game, in Oklahoma City, where they would take on the Tucson Sidewinders of the Pacific Coast League, but the Mud Hens fell to the Sidewinders by a score of 5–2.

On October 29, 2010, it was announced that Parrish would become the hitting coach for the Atlanta Braves, replacing Terry Pendleton, who was moved to first base coach. After the Braves offense went from first in the National League in On-base percentage in 2010 to 14th in 2011 with roughly the same lineup, Braves general manager Frank Wren announced on September 30, 2011, that Parrish would not return to his duties for the 2012 season.

Parrish was named manager of the West Michigan Whitecaps for the 2013 season.

Parrish was elected to the International League Hall of Fame as a manager in 2013.

On September 18, 2013, it was announced that Parrish would return to the Mud Hens for his third stint as manager. He replaced Phil Nevin, whose contract was not renewed. On August 2, 2015, Parrish announced his plan to retire at the end of the Mud Hens&#x27; season.

<text>John A. Yakabuski (born June 14, 1957) is a Canadian politician who served as Ontario Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry from 2018 to 2021 in the Doug Ford cabinet. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario who was elected in the eastern Ontario riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke in 2003. His father, Paul Yakabuski, was also a Tory Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the area from 1963 to 1987.

==Background==
Yakabuski is a former real estate sales representative, and was for twenty years the owner and operator of Yakabuski&#x27;s Home Hardware in Barry&#x27;s Bay, Ontario. At the time of his election, he was a member of the steering committee of St. Francis Memorial Hospital&#x27;s Capital Equipment Campaign. He is also active in the local Lutheran church. His late brother, Kim Yakabuski, was the life partner of former Liberal Attorney-General Ian Scott. His brother, Konrad Yakabuski, is a columnist for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. He and his wife Vicky have four children.

==Politics==
Yakabuski was elected to the Barry&#x27;s Bay municipal council in 1997, and was responsible for overseeing various issues concerning the region&#x27;s amalgamation. He did not seek re-election in 2000.

Yakabuski was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 2003 provincial election, defeating Liberal Derek Nighbor by 595 votes. This result was regarded by some as an upset, as it was the only formerly Liberal seat to be won by the Tories in an election that saw the Liberals elected to a strong majority government. Moreover, the seat had been held for many years by Liberal Sean Conway (Yakabuski&#x27;s second cousin). Yakabuski won the election despite publicizing of his earlier convictions by the opposition press.

In the 2007 provincial election, he was easily re-elected, defeating Liberal candidate Sean Kelly by over 15,000 votes. He was re-elected in both the 2011 provincial election and the 2014 provincial election.

Yakabuski was the Labour and Training Critic in the Official Opposition and the Whip of the Official Opposition. He ran for the position of interim leader of the party following the resignation of Tim Hudak but was passed over in favour of Jim Wilson.

Yakabuski was appointed the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry in the Cabinet of Doug Ford. He was dropped from cabinet in the 2021 reshuffle by Premier Doug Ford, and was appointed the Parliamentary Assistant to the Premier of Ontario.

Yakabuski was re-elected in the 2022 Ontario general election. On June 29, 2002, Yakabuski was appointed the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Environment, Parks and Conservation.

<text>This is a list of heritage railways in Australia, some of which can also be considered tourist railways. Heritage tramways have also been included. Most are members of the Association of Tourist &amp; Heritage Rail Australia (ATHRA). In addition to active operations, abandoned and putative operations are also included, but static museum sites and rolling stock operators without a &#x27;dedicated&#x27; line do not fall within Wikipedia&#x27;s definition of heritage railways. Miniature railways with gauges of less than 380mm (15 in) are excluded. Lines named in red are lacking a detailed Wikipedia entry.

The world&#x27;s second preserved railway, and the first outside the United Kingdom, was Australia&#x27;s Puffing Billy Railway. This railway operates on of track, with much of its original rolling stock built as early as 1898.

<text>The Neptune Range () is a mountain range, long, lying west-southwest of Forrestal Range in the central part of the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica. 
The range comprises Washington Escarpment with its associated ridges, valleys and peaks, the Iroquois Plateau, the Schmidt and the Williams Hills.
==Exploration and name==
The Neptune Range was discovered and photographed on 13 January 1956 on a United States Navy transcontinental plane flight from McMurdo Sound to Weddell Sea and return.
It was named by United States US-ACAN after the Navy P2V-2N &quot;Neptune&quot; aircraft with which this flight was made. 
The entire Pensacola Mountains were mapped by United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1967 and 1968 from ground surveys and United States Navy tricamera aerial photographs taken in 1964.

==Location==


The Neptune Range runs from south to north to the east if the Foundation Ice Stream.
Childs Glacier flows west from the range to join the ice stream,
The Academy Glacier flows northwest between the Patuxent Range and the southern tip of the Neptune Range to join the ice stream.
The Cordiner Peaks are to the north.
The Iroquois Plateau and the Median Snowfield are to the east.

==Glaciers==
*Foundation Ice Stream (), a major ice stream in the Pensacola Mountains of Antarctica. The ice stream drains northward for along the west side of the Patuxent Range and the Neptune Range to enter the Ronne Ice Shelf westward of Dufek Massif.
* Childs Glacier (), a glacier in the Neptune Range, draining westward from Roderick Valley to enter Foundation Ice Stream.
*Academy Glacier (), a major glacier in the Pensacola Mountains, draining northwestward between the Patuxent and Neptune Ranges to enter Foundation Ice Stream.

==Peaks==
Peaks over high include:

==Washington Escarpment==
The major west-facing escarpment of the Neptune Range, extending some and being the point of origin of a number of west-trending rock ridges. 
Mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photographs in 1956-66. 
Named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for the University of Washington at Seattle. 
Several members of the Neptune Range field party of 1963-64 attended this university.

Features, from north to south, include
*Mount Moffat () is a mountain, high, standing northeast of Mount Ege.
*Nelson Peak (), a peak in Antarctica, standing at the eastern end of Drury Ridge and Brown Ridge where the two ridges abut Washington Escarpment.
*Mount Dover (), a mountain high surmounting the southeast end of Gale Ridge where the ridge abuts the Washington Escarpment.
*Mount Hawkes (), at , the highest mountain along the Washington Escarpment, standing at the east side of Jones Valley.
*Gambacorta Peak (), a peak high, standing east of Mount Kaschak in the southern Neptune Range.

==Other features==
*Schmidt Hills (), a group of rock hills, long, lying north of Childs Glacier and west of Roderick Valley.
*Williams Hills (), a compact group of hills, long, located south of Childs Glacier and west of Roderick Valley.
*Torbert Escarpment (), an escarpment, long, marking the west margin of Median Snowfield.
*Iroquois Plateau (), a large, mainly ice-covered plateau situated east of the southern part of the Washington Escarpment in the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica.

<doc id="1130741" wikidata="Q415259" url="?curid=1130741" title="Terbinafine">
<text>Terbinafine is an antifungal medication used to treat pityriasis versicolor, fungal nail infections, and ringworm including jock itch and athlete&#x27;s foot. It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment.
Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Oral use during pregnancy is not typically recommended. The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated. Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to synthesize ergosterol. It appears to result in fungal cell death.
Terbinafine was discovered in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 255th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Terbinafine is mainly effective on molds of the order Onygenales and some yeasts in the genus &quot;Candida&quot;.

As a cream or powder, it is used topically for superficial skin infections such as jock itch (tinea cruris), athlete&#x27;s foot (tinea pedis), and other types of ringworm (tinea corporis).

Tablets by mouth are often prescribed for the treatment of onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or &quot;Candida&quot; species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the nail in the cuticle to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause hepatotoxicity, so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with liver function tests. Alternatives to oral administration have been studied.

Terbinafine may induce or exacerbate subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Persons with lupus erythematosus should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy.

==Side effects==
Many side effects and adverse drug reactions have been reported with oral terbinafine hydrochloride, possibly due to its extensive biodistribution and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with terbinafine use includes:
* Gastrointestinal problems: Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, fullness, abdominal pain, indigestion, dyspepsia, gastritis, cholestasis, flatulence, altered stool colour, abdominal muscular pain
* Central nervous system or neurological problems: Headaches, dizziness, vertigo, light-headedness, decreased concentration levels, paraesthesia (pins and needles)
* Hepatic problems: Raised liver enzyme levels, liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver damage, liver failure
* Immune system problems: Decreased white blood cell counts including pancytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and neutropenia, autoimmune reactions such as lupus erythematosus
* Psychological problems: Depression, anxiety, insomnia, increased or unusual dream activity, malaise
* Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste (ageusia), decreased taste (hypogeusia) and distorted taste (dysgeusia), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision. In extremely rare cases, the loss or impairment of taste is permanent 
* Skin problems: Rashes, hives (urticaria), skin irritation, itching, jaundice, Stevens–Johnson syndrome
* Other side effects: Fatigue, increased heart rate (tachycardia), hair loss (alopecia), decreased red blood cell count (anemia), muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia)

In 2015, physicians reported that a patient with an MTHFR enzyme mutation (specifically the C677T variant) had developed an adverse reaction to terbinafine (Lamisil) (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation.

==Pharmacology==

Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to lanosterol. In fungi, lanosterol is then converted to ergosterol; in humans, lanosterol becomes cholesterol. However, as fungi and animals diverged around 1.1 billion years ago - there is enough difference in this enzyme that terbinafine preferentially binds fungal squalene epoxidase, making it selective for inhibiting ergosterol production in fungi without significantly affecting cholesterol production in mammals. This is thought to fatally disrupt the fungal cell membrane.

Terbinafine is highly lipophilic and tends to accumulate in hair, skin, nails, and fat cells.

This accumulation results in therapeutic levels of terbinafine even after 80 days following one week treatment of 250 mg/day. Different dosing schedules have been proposed such as 500 mg/day for one week or 250 mg/day for two weeks each followed by a drug-free period of two or three weeks, totaling 3 months of treatment including the drug-free periods. Such intermittent dosing schedules appear to be as effective as continuous regimens.

==Chemistry==
Terbinafine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane, soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. 

Terbinafine is produced by coupling of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyne (tert-butylacetylene) with acrolein as a key step, followed by coupling of the product of that reaction, 6,6-dimethylhept-1-en-4-yn-3-ol, with N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine. Multiple patents and publication to alternate syntheses are available.

Despite its name it does not contain terbium.

==History==
Terbinafine first became available in Europe in 1991 and in the United States in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) tablets. The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007.

On September 28, 2007, the FDA stated that terbinafine is now approved for use by children age four and up. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child&#x27;s food to treat scalp fungus.

In the United States the price in 1999 was $547 for a 12-week course; this fell to $10 by 2015, after the patent had expired.

<text>The Patuxent Range () is a major range of the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica.
It comprises the Thomas Hills, Anderson Hills, Mackin Table and various nunataks and ridges bounded by the Foundation Ice Stream, Academy Glacier and the Patuxent Ice Stream.

==Exploration and name==
The Patuxent Range was discovered and partially photographed on January 13, 1956 in the course of a transcontinental nonstop plane flight by personnel of U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze I from McMurdo Sound to Weddell Sea and return.
It was named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for the Naval Air Station Patuxent River (at Cedar Point, Maryland) located on the south side of the mouth of the Patuxent River. The range was mapped in detail by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1956-66.

==Location==

The Putuxent Range lies to the south of the Foundation Ice Stream, west of the Academy Glacier and northeast of the Patuxent Ice Stream.
In the north, the Thomas Hills run along the south side of the Foundation Ice Stream.
The MacNamara Glacier to their south separates them from the Anderson Hills.
In the southwest, Snake Ridge is at the center of a scattered group of nunataks. 
Mackin Table is in the southeast.

== Glaciers ==

*Foundation Ice Stream (), a major ice stream in the Pensacola Mountains of Antarctica. The ice stream drains northward for along the west side of the Patuxent Range and the Neptune Range to enter the Ronne Ice Shelf westward of Dufek Massif.
*Academy Glacier (), a major glacier in the Pensacola Mountains, draining northwestward between the Patuxent and Neptune Ranges to enter Foundation Ice Stream.
*Patuxent Ice Stream [), a broad ice stream between Patuxent Range and Pecora Escarpment in the Pensacola Mountains, draining northwestward to the upper part of Foundation Ice Stream.

==Features==
Geographical features that contain or are the focus of groups of lesser features include:

*Thomas Hills (), a linear group of hills, long, between Foundation Ice Stream and MacNamara Glacier at the north end of the Patuxent Range.
*Anderson Hills (), an irregular group of hills, ridges and peaks between Mackin Table and the Thomas Hills in the Patuxent Range.
*Snake Ridge (), a serpentine ridge, long, adjoining the northwest extremity of Mackin Table in the Patuxent Range.
*Mackin Table (), an ice-topped, wedge-shaped plateau, about long, standing just north of Patuxent Ice Stream in the Patuxent Range.
