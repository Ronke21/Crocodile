<text>Studley Royal Park is an estate in North Yorkshire, England. The site has an area of and includes an 18th-century landscaped garden; the ruins of Fountains Abbey; Fountains Hall, a Jacobean mansion; and the Victorian St Mary&#x27;s church, designed by William Burges. Studley Royal House, around which the park and gardens were designed, burned down in 1946. The park, as Studley Royal Park including the ruins of Fountains Abbey, has been designated a World Heritage Site. It has also been designated a grade I listed park and garden by Historic England, and various structures within it are individually listed. 

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Fountains estate was owned by the Gresham, Proctor, and Messenger families. At the same time, the adjacent Studley estate was separately held by the Mallorie (or Mallory) and then Aislabie families, after the marriage of Mary Mallory and George Aislabie. The estates were combined on 22 December 1767, when William Aislabie purchased the Fountains estate from John Messenger. In 1966, the property came into public ownership after its purchase by West Riding County Council. In 1983, it was acquired by the National Trust. 

The gardens and park reflect every stage in the evolution of English garden fashion, from the late 17th century to the 1780s and beyond. Most unusually, both John and William embraced new garden fashions by extending their designed landscape rather than replacing and remaking outmoded parts. As a result, the cumulative whole is a catalogue of significant landscaping styles.

== Background ==

Studley Royal Park is an estate in North Yorkshire, England. The land broadly slopes and east-facing views are a feature of its landscape. The River Skell runs through the site, cutting through layers of Upper Carboniferous sandstone and Permian Magnesian limestone. The park was formed through the aggregation of the former land-holdings of Fountains Abbey, which were purchased by the Gresham family after the Dissolution, and the estate of Studley Royal.

Whilst the prehistoric origins of the land upon which Studley Royal Park now stands are under-researched, there is evidence for settlement in the area. An excavated flint assemblage from the park demonstrates the presence of people working flint on the site. There is evidence of farming activity dated to 4,500 years ago.

Material from the Iron Age is also associated with the site, including a lost gold torc. Iron Age enclosures at Mackershaw date from the sixth to fifth centuries BC. In the later phases of that enclosure, Romano-British material, including an Egyptian glass bangle, has also been discovered. The presence of Romano-British communities is also attested by the excavation of four skeletons by the vicar of Wath in 1881.

Documentary sources and place-name evidence, rather than archaeological excavation, provide insight into the early medieval period in the area. The Venerable Bede recorded that King Alhfrith of Deira granted land for a monastery near Ripon to Eata.

== History ==

=== Fountains Abbey estate ===
Fountains Abbey was founded in 1132 by Benedictine monks who left St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York to follow the Cistercian order. During the medieval period, monastic landholding steadily increased. For example, in the 1220s, Cassandra de Aleman donated land at Swanley to become part of the monastic grange.

After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 by Henry VIII, the Abbey buildings and over 40% of the former monastic estate was sold by the Crown to Sir Richard Gresham, a merchant. The Greshams, as new owners of a formerly monastic site had a responsibility to render it incapable of future religious use. This was done through a programme of demolition and sale of goods, which included the stripping of lead from the buildings, the removal of glass and Nidderdale &#x27;marble&#x27; from the church.

The property was passed down through several generations of Sir Richard&#x27;s family, then sold to Stephen Proctor in 1596. This included the precinct, Fountains Park and Swanley Grange. It was Proctor who built Fountains Hall probably between 1598 and 1604. The hall is a Jacobean mansion, built partly with stone from the Abbey ruins. Proctor was subsequently imprisoned and sold Fountains Park to pay his legal fees. In April 1622 the Fountains estate was re-combined by Timothy Whittingham, who re-mortgaged it the same year to Humphrey Wharton. Over the subsequent two years, parts of the estate were ceded to several creditors, but ultimately Wharton regained control. The 1627 estate sale includes details for a lead casting workshop in the Warming House; the estate was bought by Richard Ewens and his son-in-law John Messenger. During the English Civil War Messenger reputedly fought at the Battles of Marston Moor and at Naseby. In 1655 Ewens&#x27; grandson, William Messenger, inherited the estate.

The Messengers were never wealthy, and in 1676 William Messenger had to arrange mortgages on the estate in order to pay for his daughters&#x27; marriages. Other financial troubles led William to leave his family, and he died in Paris in 1680, leaving his three-year-old son, John Messenger, to inherit. He married Margaret Scrope in 1698, a year after he came of age, and around this time he began re-building works on Fountain Hall. He rented out areas of the former abbey, including the mill; however these leases excluded mineral extraction, which were kept by Messenger. The family were also keenly interested in the ruins of the abbey itself, and allowed people to visit from as early as 1655.

In 1736, William&#x27;s son Michael James married Elizabeth Sayer and took responsibility for the estate. He commissioned the first measured survey of the abbey in 1758. The family&#x27;s financial position was declining and by 1765 Michael was selling oaks from the estate. Michael James died in 1766 and his son John Michael inherited. On 22 December 1767, John Michael sold the Fountains estate to William Aislabie for £18,000.

=== Studley estate development ===

From 1452 onwards, Studley Royal was inhabited by the Mallory family, most notably by MPs John Mallory and William Mallory. A depiction of the enclosed park first appeared on Christopher Saxton&#x27;s 1577 map of Yorkshire. In 1607 John Mallory commissioned the first surviving survey of the estate. This listed land-holdings and it demonstrated that the estate formerly extended beyond the park. During the English Civil War, William Mallory and his son John, were loyal to the Crown; John commanded a force that defended Skipton Castle. They only surrendered in December 1645. William died in 1646 and John was fined by Parliament for half the value of the estate. Paying off the fine was attempted by selling off his wife&#x27;s family estate, as well as other property, including a mill at Galphay and a farm at Nunwick. However, despite this, when John died in January 1656, and his son William inherited, aged only eight years old, debts had mounted up to £10,000. During this time it was John&#x27;s widow, Mary, who managed the estate and managed to bring it within its means once more. However, in 1667, William died aged nineteen and the estate passed to his sisters: the eldest Mary, who was married to George Aislabie, as well as Jane and Elizabeth.

Aislabie was the son of a farmer from Osgodby in North Yorkshire. He worked as a clerk for William Turbutt in the church courts at York. As part of Turbutt&#x27;s household, Aislabie inherited £200 at his death in November 1648. After Turbutt&#x27;s death Aislabie remained as part of the household, working for the widowed Elizabeth Turbutt. There is a suggestion made by John Richard Walbran that the pair may have had a romantic attachment, but this is unproven. Nevertheless he was the primary beneficiary of Turbutt&#x27;s will when she died in 1662 – a result of which he purchased Treasurer&#x27;s House in York. It was around this time that he married Mary Mallorie. George was killed in a duel in 1676. It was George who began plans for the re-establishment of an enlarged park with Studley Royal in its centre. Studley Great Gate, now more commonly known as East Gate, the largest probable remnant of his plans.

George Aislabie&#x27;s wife, Mary, preserved the estate, but by the time of her death in 1683 was in debt. Trustees to the estate were appointed until the heir, Mallorie Aislabie, came of age: William Robinson, husband of the eldest daughter Mary and Arthur Ingram. Mallorie died in 1685 and was succeeded as heir by his brother George, who inherited but then died in 1693. The third brother, John Aislabie inherited the Studley estate. A survey in 1694 describes both an &#x27;old park&#x27; and a &#x27;new park&#x27; which invites consideration of expansion under his father.

By 1695 John Aislabie was the Tory Member of Parliament for Ripon, and in 1718 became Chancellor of the Exchequer. This enabled some of the family&#x27;s perhaps long held plans, to landscape the park, to begin. This included the construction of a tower on How Hill, and the canal and cascade that became the foundation of the Water Garden. Aislabie was a principal sponsor of the South Sea Company scheme, the bill for which was promoted by him personally. In 1720 this vast financial operation collapsed, and in 1721 he was expelled from Parliament and disqualified for life from public office. Stocks from the South Sea Company were grafted to the East India Company, of which his brother William was a director.

=== Development of the gardens ===

Aislabie returned to Yorkshire and from 1723 devoted himself to the landscaping of the estate. This included the construction of a boundary wall along the western side of the valley between the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal estates. This wall had at least one viewing platform and connected to the path known as High Walk. Boundaries including ha-has were also constructed at this time. It is possible the design was influenced by his kinsman William Benson&#x27;s knowledge of neo-Palladian design. Other early features included The Upper Canal and Drum Falls. Flooding subsequently damaged these early developments, and by 1726 approximately 100 men were working to create water features, which included canals and ponds. The design of the cascade and the fishing lodges is attributed to Roger Morris, who worked with Colen Campbell. The cascade and the canal was described in 1729 by Stephen Switzer in his volume of engineering, &quot;Hydrostatics.&quot; Aislabie and Morris&#x27;s works did not just extend to the water gardens, but also to other areas of the estate. By 1728 work was also underway on the High Stables, which can still be seen in the deer park.

During the 1730s and 1740s, there were a number of head gardeners employed by Aislabie. William Fisher worked on the estate from at least 1717 to 1732, when he was paid off. He was followed by John Hossack (left 1738), Mathias Mitchell (dismissed 1742) and then James Lockey (died 1744). Another significant employee was Robert Doe, who was a builder, mason and later head gardener too. Doe later worked on building projects for Castle Howard and for Swinton Castle. This was also a period of expansion, during which Aislabie changed the lease on Mackershaw – making it permanent, rather than leased for agriculture. During this phase, the Grotto was constructed and changes were made to footpaths around its location; the Temple of Piety was also built.

In 1738 the first known plan of the gardens was made by Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet of Penicuik, who was visiting them as part of a northern tour. At the same time the Octagon Tower was also constructed and it was glazed and decorated during 1735; subsequently stuccowork was added by Francesco Vassalli. Other buildings constructed at this time include the Bathing House and the Boathouse. The planting at this time was perhaps sparser than that of the estate in the early twenty-first century: eighteenth-century visitors reported seeing bare rock between the trees. The late 1730s also saw a revision of the statuary scheme in the gardens, which included the introduction of a statue of Neptune, centrally located in the Moon Pond.

After Aislabie&#x27;s death on 18 June 1742, his son William inherited, and whilst little is known about William&#x27;s life, it is known that he set out on a Grand Tour in 1720, which was thwarted by political turmoil in France. In 1724 he married Lady Elizabeth Cecil, with whom he had six children: two sons and four daughters. Elizabeth and two of their daughters died in a smallpox outbreak in 1733. William&#x27;s first scheme for the gardens was the construction of a funerary pyramid, modelled on the one at Stowe Gardens. He also extended the designed landscape further down the Skell Valley and introduced in 1745 a &#x27;Chinese house&#x27;, inspired by fashion at the time.

In 1745 William re-married, to Elizabeth Vernon, who was the niece of his step-mother. Perhaps, as a result, Studley Hall was renovated, which included the decoration of two rooms in a chinoiserie style. In the 1750s a gardeners house was built near the Kitchen Garden and two ice houses were constructed. A private garden with aviary was also created next to Studley Hall during this period. William also added new architectural features to the park: an obelisk at the western end of the main avenue and the Belvedere, which was a Gothic garden room. In addition to new buildings, existing ones had a change of character: for example the Temple of Venus had family portraits installed in it and its name changes to that of &#x27;Banqueting House&#x27;. In the 1750s the network of footpaths around the gardens were also much greater than the modern-day lay-out. Overall, William extended the landscaped area in the picturesque romantic style, contrasting with the formality of his father&#x27;s work. Between them, the two created what is arguably England&#x27;s most important 18th-century landscape gardens.

=== Combined estates ===
On 22 December 1767, William Aislabie purchased the Fountains estate from John Messenger, combining the Studley and Fountains estates.

In February 1768, the gardens were flooded, which resulted in repairs and renovations. Subsequently, the reservoir was expanded from a two-acre, to a three-and-a-half-acre capacity. This period also included the insertion of new garden buildings, such as the Green Arch and the White Seat. In addition, new water features were added to the south-east of the gardens. 1768 also saw Robert Doe, on the instruction of Aislabie, begin to clear and stabilise the abbey ruins; work which continued until at least 1773. Part of this scheme of work included the demolition of the Lay Brothers&#x27; Cloister. It also included construction: the Gazebo was built under the east Window, which provided visitors with an elevated view of the nave.

Anne Boleyn&#x27;s Hill is first named as part of the gardens in 1771, where an antiquarian headless statue looked out on the valley. The statue moved and was restored to its location in 2004. The last mention of the Rotondo and the Coffin Lawn dates to 1775, and it is likely the former was used to infill the latter. The canalisation of the Skell near the Abbey was undertaken in 1773, which used the river as a framing device for the view of the abbey from Anne Boleyn&#x27;s Seat (constructed c. 1789–91).

William also added ornamentation to parts of the ruins, adding detailing, but most significantly recreating the location of the high altar through the repositioning of medieval tiles found throughout the site. He also added planting to the cloister, in the form of shrubs and flowers. Greater security was also introduced to the abbey, with lockable doors and gates. However, there was contemporary criticism of these changes, in particular from William Gilpin, who visited Studley on a tour of the north of England.

William died on 17 May 1781 in London. The estate passed to his elder daughter, Elizabeth Allanson, after his two sons predeceased him. Whilst she spent the majority of her time as owner at her home in Twickenham, Elizabeth did continue her family&#x27;s civic work in Ripon – donating to the poor, funding streetlighting and building Ripon Town Hall. However, although she appointed Christopher Hall as agent, during her ownership, and her lack of presence at the estate, many areas of the designed landscape became neglected.

Elizabeth died on 8 March 1808 and was succeeded by her niece, Elizabeth Sophia Lawrence, who lived at Studley from 1808 until her death in 1845. An influential woman in the area, she used her position to influence (and punish) voters. Under her ownership, she made further additions to the grounds, which included the stone Obelisk, as well as Robin Hood&#x27;s Well, which enclosed a small spring. She also made repairs to the abbey, including to Huby&#x27;s Tower. It was under her ownership that John Richard Walbran first undertook excavations in 1840. In her will she left bequests totalling £237,000, including £1000 to fund a dispensary in Ripon.

The estate then devolved to Thomas Philip, 2nd Earl de Grey, a distant relative. Under de Grey, Walbran undertook further excavation. These excavations in the 1850s also piqued public interest further in the site. This was furthered by the opening of curative springs nearby in Harrogate bringing a large tourism audience with it. Management of the huge increases in the numbers of tourists entailed the creation of new routes, including the De Grey Walk and the Well Walk. In 1847 a new one shilling entrance fee was introduced. The first record of a school trip to the site was from St Peter&#x27;s School, Dallowgill, in September 1851. In 1858 the first museum for the site was opened in the Muniments Room, above the Warming House. The 1850s also saw major events held at the estate for the first time. These raised funds for a variety of causes, such as the Ripon Mechanics Institute, to celebrate peace in Crimea, and a &#x27;Great Musical Celebration&#x27; in 1868. In 1869 the third-earliest bicycle race to be held in England ran through the estate.

On de Grey&#x27;s death in 1859, the estate passed to his nephew, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, and later the Viceroy of India. He redeveloped areas of Studley Hall, as well as renovating the gardens near the house. He also constructed the Pheasantry at the edge of the estate, as well as building a golf course, whose first professional was Harry Vardon. He also built St Mary&#x27;s church in the park. During his ownership of the estate, three structures were added: Studley tea room, an oval island in the lake, and the High Seat in the west of the gardens. During this period, more exotic trees were introduced as part of the planting scheme – for example, a &quot;Wellingtonia gigantea&quot; was planted by the Prince of Wales in 1863. In 1886 a pageant was held on the estate, celebrating Ripon&#x27;s millennium; a similar event was repeated in 1896 for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

The 1st Marquess of Ripon died in 1909 and his son Frederick Oliver inherited the estate. On the death of Frederick Robinson, 2nd Marquess of Ripon in 1923, the estate was acquired by his cousin Clare George Vyner. Visitor income became more significant for the Vyner family than it had been for the Robinsons, yet the family had a strong sense of social responsibility and in the 1930s established the Fountains Abbey Settlers Society, which provided work and skills to unemployed families. This also included a work scheme that dredged the river. In addition to the scheme on the estate, Vyner also funded the construction of a model village in Swarland, Northumberland. The Settlers Society ended at the outbreak of the Second World War, but its accommodation was repurposed to house German and Polish refugees. During the war much of the estate&#x27;s land was cultivated for the first time in 600 years, as part of the &#x27;Dig For Victory&#x27; campaign. Studley Hall after doing war service as the home of Queen Ethelburga&#x27;s School, was destroyed by fire in April 1946. After the war, the upkeep of the estate became too expensive for the Vyner family, who sold it to Broadlands Properties for £1,250,000. They subsequently also sold Fountains Hall to West Riding County Council in 1969.

=== Public ownership ===

In 1966 much of the estate was purchased by West Riding County Council from Broadlands Properties, and the property was reopened to the public in 1967. However, resource pressures meant that the local authority was keen to find another owner for the estate. There had been previous appeals to the National Trust to undertake running the site, including in 1923. In 1983 the property was acquired by the National Trust.

English Heritage is responsible for the conservation of the abbey under a guardianship agreement, but managed on a day-to-day basis by the National Trust. St Mary’s Church is owned by the State and managed by the National Trust under a local management agreement. In 1986 the entire estate was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It gained recognition as it fulfils the criteria of “being a masterpiece of human creative genius&quot;, and&quot; an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history”. The initial proposal for World Heritage Status only extended to Fountains Abbey and St Mary&#x27;s Church; it was on the recommendation of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) that the listing extended to include Studley Royal. In 1992, a new visitor centre and car parks were designed by Ted Cullinan to accommodate growing visitor numbers. Lying north-west of the Abbey above the valley floor, the new visitor centre incorporated a shop, large restaurant, lecture theatre and exhibition space (currently office space) arranged around an open courtyard.

In 2015 stage designer Gary McCann was commissioned to produce work in response to the buildings on the property; the resulting exhibition, entitled Folly!, installed works in spaces such as the Banqueting House. In 2016, Mat Collishaw created &quot;Seria Ludo&quot; and &quot;The Pineal Eye&quot; in the Temple of Piety. In 2018, Charles Holland, Lucy Orta and Flea Folly Architects created artworks to reimagine lost follies in the landscape. In 2021, Steve Messam created three artworks in an exhibition entitled &quot;These Passing Things&quot; and in 2022 Joe Cornish created a photographic exhibition &quot;Still Time to Wonder&quot; in various buildings on the property.

=== Significance ===
Studley Royal, under National Trust ownership, is the preserved core of a once much more substantial Aislabie project, which incorporated the surrounding agrarian landscape that they owned, long-distance views to Ripon and beyond, and rides extending to other designed landscapes including Laver Banks and Hackfall (seven miles from Studley).:171, 177–184 The gardens and park reflect every stage in the evolution of English garden fashion, from the late seventeenth-century to the 1780s and beyond. Most unusually both John and William embraced new garden fashions by extending their designed landscape rather than replacing and remaking outmoded parts.:333 As a result, the cumulative whole is a catalogue of significant landscaping styles. This includes John Aislabie&#x27;s ground-breaking appreciation of natural topographical landforms, for him it was not necessary to level ground and create a garden, the garden could be made to accommodate and display the underlying landscape.:231 

==Major features==
The park incorporates Fountains Abbey, Fountains Hall, and several other notable historic features.

===Studley Royal Water Garden===
The water garden at Studley Royal created by John Aislabie in 1718 is one of the best surviving examples of a Georgian water garden in England. It was expanded by his son, William who purchased the adjacent Fountains Estate. The garden&#x27;s elegant ornamental lakes, canals, temples and cascades provide a succession of dramatic eye-catching vistas. It is also studded with a number of follies including a neo-Gothic tower and a palladian-style banqueting house.

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
St Mary&#x27;s Church was built by the architect William Burges and commissioned by the family of the 1st Marquess of Ripon. It has been suggested that the construction of this place of worship was prompted by the death of Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was kidnapped and killed in Greece in 1870.

Burges&#x27; appointment as architect was most likely due to the connection between his greatest patron, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute and Vyner, who had been friends at Oxford. St Mary&#x27;s, on Lady Ripon&#x27;s estate at Studley Royal, was commissioned in 1870 and work began in 1871. The church was consecrated in 1878. As at Skelton, Burges&#x27; design demonstrates a move from his favoured Early-French, to an English style. Nikolaus Pevsner writes of &quot;a Victorian shrine, a dream of Early English glory.&quot; The interior is spectacular, exceeding Skelton in richness and majesty. The stained glass is of particularly high quality. St Mary&#x27;s is Burges&#x27; &quot;ecclesiastical masterpiece.&quot;

Both marquesses and their wives are buried there.

=== How Hill Tower ===

Prior to 1346, a chapel dedicated to St Michael the Archangel was built on How Hill. This became a minor medieval pilgrimage site. Visitors to the site could see both York Minster and Ripon Cathedral from its summit.:28 The flooring was made of mosaic tiles, similar to those attributed to a painted pavement dating to between 1236 and 1247. The chapel was repaired by Marmaduke Huby between 1494 and 1526. Post-reformation the chapel continued to be used between 1551–54 for the churching of women, until falling into ruin.:42

A tower was constructed next to the ruins, and reusing some of their masonry by, John Aislabie. Likely designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, the view from the tower extended across the Studley estates, and York could even be seen twenty-six miles away.:83–85

In 1810 an estate survey recorded a farmhouse on the site, but by 1822 the description had changed to &#x27;How Hill House &amp; Tower&#x27;. Presumably, the site had lost its significance as a garden building in a designed landscape and was commissioned to a more functional use.:250 Whilst its role as a home stopped in the 1930s, there was another use-change: during the Second World War the Home Guard used it as an observation post.:324 

===Deer park===
The deer park, where the church stands, is home to deer, and a wealth of other flora and fauna. At Studley there are three types of deer: Red Deer, Fallow Deer and Sika Deer. John Clerk, visiting in 1738, described how the buck deer moved in a group, so that they &quot;resemble a moving forrest [sic]&quot;.

== Buildings and structures ==

===Studley Royal House===

Studley Royal House (or Hall) stood in the north-west corner of the park. Originally a medieval manor house, there is a record from the 1220s of an extensive garden created by Cassandra de Aleman.:33 It consisted of a main block with forward projecting wings, it burned down in 1716 and was rebuilt by John Aislabie. He filled in the centre, to which his son William added a portico in 1762 to complete its Palladian appearance.

It was altered and developed by the 1st Marquess of Ripon, who created a new entrance hall, a royal suite, and the reorganisation of the domestic service areas. He also added a Catholic chapel at the western side of the house in 1878.

The house burnt down in 1946, and its remains were demolished by the Vyner family, who could not afford repairs to it. Instead, the splendid Georgian stable block, built for John Aislabie’s racehorses between 1728 and 1732, was converted into an elegant Palladian country house set in 2½ acres of private formal gardens on high ground overlooking the deer park towards Ripon Cathedral in the distance.

Built of stone under a slate roof with distinctive pavilion towers in each of the four corners, the pristine, 11,708sq ft house surrounds a central square courtyard overlooked by all the main rooms and dominated by the working clock tower.

=== Studley Magna ===

The deserted medieval village of Studley Magna mainly lies within the boundaries of the park. Excavation demonstrated that the village was aligned with the important road to Aldfield. The earliest ceramics from the site date to c.1180–1220, whilst the latest finds date from c.1300. The site included a large two-storey miller&#x27;s house with a stone fireplace that was rare for the period. The house was sold in 1362 by Widow Horner to Richard Tempest.:30–32

=== The Banqueting House ===

Documentary evidence suggests that the Banqueting House was being completed in 1731, and is described in the estate accounts as &#x27;the new building&#x27;. The structure had several phases of alteration after construction, and other documents refer to it as &#x27;the Greenhouse&#x27;. In front of the façade a deep coffin-shaped lawn was introduced, who sightlines connected the building and the Rotondo. Above the Banqueting House, amongst the trees, is an oval platform, which is likely to be the Dial Lawn, which is described in accounts in 1730s.

=== The Temple of Piety ===
The building was constructed based on a sketch by Andrea Palladio owned by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and was initially known as the Temple of Hercules. Documentary evidence shows that it was constructed and named by April 1736.

=== Mackershaw Lodges ===
These buildings were constructed after 1731, with the change in terms of the loan (to acquisition) of the Mackershaw area. They compromise two small lodges with classical pediments either side of a central arch, constructed from rough, undressed stone, with Venetian windows.

=== Lost buildings ===

==== Wattle Hall ====
One of the buildings most frequently attested in the early eighteenth-century is the Wattle Hall. Surviving records suggest that it was made of bent branches rather than brick or stone, and it was repaired in 1732.

==== Rotondo ====
Close to Kendall&#x27;s Walk and in the north-east corner of Coffin Lawn, evidence for the Rotondo first appears in a painting dating to 1734–41. It was demolished in the 1770s. A close comparison to this would have been the Temple of Venus in Stowe Gardens.

==== Pyramid ====
William&#x27;s first building work for the gardens was ordering the construction of a funerary pyramid, modelled on the one at Stowe Gardens. Whilst designs for this building exist, its location is unknown. It is possible that the stone was cut, but it was never constructed.

==== Chinese house ====

The Chinese house was constructed in 1745 and a 1751 visitor described it as having blue columns, gilded decoration, a white ceiling, a variety of Chinese ornaments and stuccowork by Giuseppe Cortese. It also had a balustrade seat running inside the columns. There is a surviving sketch of the building, but only the plinth for its survives. It was located beyond the southern limit of National Trust estate. The area around the house was known as the Chinese Wood, to which two chinoiserie-style bridges provided access.

<text>Acoustic Dance Party is an extended play (EP) album by Toad the Wet Sprocket recorded and released in 1994. It contains acoustic versions of some of their most popular songs.

==Recording==

The liner notes tells the story about the recording of &quot;Something&#x27;s Always Wrong&quot; that appears on this EP.

It&#x27;s a good thing we decided to record acoustically because the day before the session our rehearsal space had been broken into and all our gear was stolen. So with borrowed guitars and shakers, and a lot of help from our friend, Bruce Winter, we proceeded. The recording was punctuated by the filling out of police reports and dusting for fingerprints, all of which added an ironic element in light of the song&#x27;s lyrical content.

The additional tracks were recorded before a small private audience. It is rumored that the album as a whole was produced to make up for an in-store appearance in Schaumburg, Illinois, that was canceled by the city&#x27;s mayor.

<text>The Ordnungspolizei (Orpo, , meaning &quot;Order Police&quot;) were the uniformed police force in Nazi Germany from 1936 to 1945. The Orpo was absorbed into the Nazi monopoly on power after regional police jurisdiction was removed in favour of the central Nazi government (&quot;Reich-ification&quot;, &quot;Verreichlichung&quot;, of the police). In 1936, Heinrich Himmler, the commander (&quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;) of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS), was appointed Chief of the German Police in the Interior Ministry. The top and upper leadership positions of the Orpo were filled by police officers who belonged to or had joined the SS. Owing to their green uniforms, Orpo members were also referred to as Grüne Polizei (Green Police). The force was established as a centralised organisation based in Berlin uniting the municipal, city, and rural uniformed police that had been previously organised on a state-by-state basis.

The &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; encompassed virtually all of Nazi Germany&#x27;s law-enforcement and emergency response organisations, including fire brigades, coast guard, and civil defence. Himmler and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Orpo, worked to transform the police force into militarised formations ready to serve the regime&#x27;s aims of conquest and racial annihilation. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. During World War II, the force was tasked with policing the civilian population of the occupied and colonised countries. In 1941, the Orpo&#x27;s activities escalated to genocide after the Order Police battalions formed into independent regiments or were attached to &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; security divisions and &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. Independently and in collaboration with those units, members of the Orpo perpetrated crimes against humanity and mass-murder during the Holocaust.

==History==
Almost immediately after the Nazis seized power, they instituted measures to gain political control of German police and to use them against their perceived enemies. The commander of the SS, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, had already been deputy chief of the Prussian secret police, when by decree of 17 June 1936, he was appointed Chief of the Police force; he performed both functions in parallel and was officially and publicly referred to as &quot;Reichsführer-SS and Chief of the German Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior&quot;. Although nominally subordinate to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, Himmler could participate in meetings of the Reich Cabinet – when and if police agendas were discussed. In 1943, Himmler himself was appointed Minister of the Interior.

Traditionally, law enforcement in Germany had been a state and local matter. When Himmler was given the lead over all of Germany&#x27;s uniformed law enforcement agencies in 1936, he divided the police into two main areas: the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo or Order Police) under the command of Kurt Daluege and the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo or security police) under Reinhard Heydrich. The Orpo assumed duties of regular uniformed law enforcement while the SiPo was made up by the combined forces of the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Gestapo; secret state police) and the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (Kripo; criminal investigation police). The Gestapo was a political police agency with additional legally guaranteed powers of arrest. On 27 September 1939, shortly after the start of World War II, the SiPo and the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD; SS security service) were folded into the Reich Security Main Office (&quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; or RSHA). The RSHA symbolised the close connection between the SS (a party organisation) and the police (a state organisation). The Order Police (uniformed police, enforcement police) remained in the Ministry of the Interior. Himmler&#x27;s multiple attempts to increase the proportion of SS members in the Orpo failed. Nonetheless, his reorganisation of the police under the RSHA enabled him to have &quot;watchdogs&quot; in multiple army districts and coordinated the power of the SS, SiPo, and Orpo, which historian Helmut Langerbein says &quot;perverted normal police work&quot;.

Himmler pursued the amalgamation of SS and police into a form of &quot;State Protection Corps&quot; (&quot;Staatsschutzkorps&quot;), and used the expanded reach the police powers gave him to persecute ideological opponents of the Nazi regime and &quot;undesirables&quot; such as Jews, freemasons, churches, homosexuals, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and other groups defined as &quot;asocial&quot;. The Nazi conception of criminality was racial and biological, holding that criminal traits were hereditary, and had to be exterminated to purify German blood. As a result, even ordinary criminals were consigned to concentration camps to remove them from the German racial community (&quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;) and ultimately exterminate them.

The Order Police was one – among several – of the executing organisations that facilitated inhumane goals pursued by Himmler and the RSHA, transforming and reorienting police functions into part of the Nazi security apparatus as they prepared for war. Instructions for the Orpo came through the regional political administrative authorities and/or the Higher SS and Police Leaders (HSSPF) – the latter had authority to command both police branches and the SS-forces, because Himmler intended all along to establish harmony between the police and the SS. Most of the battalions of the Order Police troops in the east were deployed for the expulsion and extermination of the Jewish population, since parts were assigned to the SS &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. Their personnel were used to guard ghettos or to carry out mass shootings. Order police played an executive role in the Holocaust by providing men for the tasks involved, &quot;both career professionals and reservists, in both battalion formations and precinct service&quot; (&quot;Einzeldienst&quot;).

Before the Nazi siezure of power, there was already a penchant for nationalistic beliefs and militarism among police officers in Germany, since most of its members consisted of men who had fought in World War I. Many officers of the police forces in Weimar believed the causation of Germany&#x27;s loss in that war was bound up in the myths of being stabbed in the back by profiteers and Jews, which certainly contributed to their willingness to believe the National Socialist message. Beginning in February 1933, Nazi minister Hermann Göring issued a decree that Nazi party members and those in related organisations &quot;were to receive priority as applicants for the Order Police.&quot; Just a few months later, Kurt Daluege issued a secret memorandum that emphasised eight to ten weeks worth of ideological indoctrination for SA and SS members transitioning into the Order Police at the rank of captain or higher, to ensure &quot;close ties between the state instruments of power [the police] and the SA and SS.&quot; 

By 1935, there was an increased national political curricula and intensive ideological training by the &quot;Comradeship of the German Police&quot; (&quot;Kameradschaftsbund der deutschen Polizei&quot;). Monthly national political lectures were instituted, and all police officers were encouraged to attend courses in state and party training facilities. Historian Edward B. Westermann writes that the &quot;transformation of the police into political soldiers and instruments of genocide occurred in large part due to the efforts of Heinrich Himmler and Kurt Daluege to create an organizational culture within the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; that married a &quot;martial attitude&quot; with Nazi racial ideology.&quot; In keeping with Nazi ideological programmatic lines, the Order Police, alongside the SS, played a key role in implementing Nazi racial policies. Unlike the SS, whose members voluntarily aligned with its ideology, the police required extensive ideological training to adopt and support the SS&#x27;s goals, which was generally accepted due to a combination of Nazi propaganda, latent antisemitism, and a societal disposition towards obedience to authority.

Within the administrative organ (&quot;Verwaltungspolizei&quot;) for instance, the Order Police were required to read specific history books and essays on Nazi ideology, which were integrated into their practical police training and exams, ensuring alignment with Nazi goals. Training for State Protection Police (&quot;Schutzpolizei&quot;) at the Berlin-Schöneberg School in 1937 included 44 weekly hours focused on police and criminal law, with two hours dedicated to national politics and ideological training by SS instructors. Similarly, the curriculum included history and National Socialist ideology. From the end of 1942 to the end of 1944, the Mariaschein Police School (later moved to Heidenheim) conducted monthly ideological training sessions for the &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; with corresponding training of like kind being held at other police and police weapons schools across Nazi-occupied Europe.

==Organization==
The German Order Police had grown to 244,500 men by mid-1940. In preparation for the war of aggression and conquest, a replacement police force was set up as early as 1937 to take over patrol and guard duties. This auxiliary police could be activated by decree for service in their home districts and had grown to over 90,000 by the beginning of the war. These older men were drafted and conscripted into the reserve police, and in the course of the war, veterans were also called up. The majority of them served in their home environment, some were deployed in police reserve battalions.

In 1936, Himmler divided the Nazi police into two branches. The central command office known as the &quot;Ordnungspolizei Hauptamt&quot; was housed in the old office building of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior in Berlin at NW 7, Unter den Linden 72/74. From 1936 to 1941, it consisted of two offices: the Command Department (&quot;Kommandoamt&quot;), responsible for finance, personnel and medical; and the Office of Administration and Law (&quot;Verwaltung&quot;), responsible for handling all administrative police, legal and economic tasks of the entire Order Police. In 1941, the Colonial Office, the Office of Fire Brigades, and the Office of Technical Emergency Aid were added.

While the Order Police was initially commanded by Kurt Daluege, in May 1943, he had a massive heart attack and was removed from duty. He was replaced by Police and Waffen-SS General Alfred Wünnenberg, who had previously spent his career as a professional police officer.

===Branches of police===

The administration police (&quot;Verwaltungspolizei&quot;) was the branch with overall command authority for all Orpo police stations. The &quot;Verwaltungspolizei&quot; also was the central office for record keeping and was the command authority for civilian law enforcement groups, which included the &quot;Gesundheitspolizei&quot; (health police), &quot;Gewerbepolizei&quot; (commercial or trade police), and the &quot;Baupolizei&quot; (building police). In the main towns, &quot;Verwaltungspolizei&quot;, &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; and &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; would be organised into a police administration known as the &quot;Polizeipräsidium&quot; or &quot;Polizeidirektion&quot;, which had authority over these police forces in the urban district. Generally speaking, there were three subtypes of uniformed police forces within the Order Police, arranged according to the population size and density of the community they served.&quot; These were:
* Gendarmerie (rural police), who were tasked with frontier law enforcement to include small communities, rural districts, and mountainous terrain.
* Municipal protection police &quot;(Gemeindepolizei)&quot; municipal uniformed police in smaller and some large towns. 
* State protection police &quot;(Schutzpolizei)&quot;, state uniformed police in cities and most large towns, which included police-station duties (&quot;Revierdienst&quot;) and barracked police units for riots and public safety (&quot;Kasernierte Polizei&quot;).

Inspectors of the Order Police in various branches were established in September 1936, overseeing the entire Order Police within their jurisdictions. At the start of the war, they were gradually renamed &quot;Commanders of the Order Police&quot; (BdO) and given greater authority, directly reporting to Higher SS and Police Leaders. Although fully integrated into the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;-system, its police officers were still considered municipal civil servants. The civilian law enforcement in towns with a municipal protection police was not performed by the &quot;Verwaltungspolizei&quot;, but by municipal civil servants. Until 1943, they also had municipal criminal investigation departments, but that year, all such departments with more than 10 detectives were integrated into the Kripo.

====Other police forces====
Additional police units not entirely subordinate to the &quot;Hauptamt Ordnungspolizei&quot; or the Reich Security Main Office existed across Germany, which made them outside the regular Nazi police structure and were &quot;staffed mainly by officials from the police and judiciary who had served under Weimar.&quot; Despite the seeming independence of other functional policing and public safety organizations, they were still part of the Nazi state, which was monitored and controlled by the SS and its subordinated agencies, such as the Gestapo.

==Police battalions==

===Invasion of Poland===

By the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939, the Order Police had reached a strength of 131,000 men. Correspondingly, between 1939 and 1945, the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; maintained military formations, who were trained and outfitted by the main police offices within Germany. Specific duties varied widely from unit to unit and from one year to another. Generally, the Order Police were not directly involved in frontline combat, except for Ardennes in May 1940, and the Siege of Leningrad in 1941. The first 17 battalion formations (from 1943 renamed &quot;SS-Polizei-Bataillone&quot;) were deployed by the Orpo in September 1939 along with the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during the invasion of Poland. One unit was organised under the command of Udo von Woyrsch and its members were specifically tasked to &quot;carry out executions&quot;. Under Woyrsch, these Orpo men terrorised the Jews of Bedzin, Katowice, and Sosnowiec, where they wrecked Jewish-owned property, shot dozens, and in one case in the town of Dynow, forced a dozen Jews into a synagogue before setting it on fire. 

The battalions also guarded Polish prisoners of war behind the German lines, and carried out expulsion of Poles from &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; under the banner of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. They also committed atrocities against both the Catholic and the Jewish populations as part of those &quot;resettlement actions&quot;. After hostilities had ceased, the battalions – such as Reserve Police Battalion 101 – took up the role of security forces, patrolling the perimeters of the Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland (the internal ghetto security issues were managed by the &quot;SS&quot;, &quot;SD&quot;, and the Criminal Police, in conjunction with the Jewish ghetto administration).

Each battalion consisted of approximately 500 men armed with light infantry weapons. In the east, each company also had a heavy machine-gun detachment. Administratively, the Police Battalions remained under the Chief of Police Kurt Daluege, but operationally they were under the authority of regional SS and Police Leaders (&quot;SS- und Polizeiführer&quot;), who reported, in a separate chain of command, directly to &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler. The battalions were used for various auxiliary duties, including the so-called anti-partisan operations, support of combat troops, and construction of defence works (i.e. the Atlantic Wall).

Some of them were focused on traditional security roles as an occupying force, while others were directly involved in actions designed to inflict terror and in the ensuing Holocaust. While they were similar to &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, they were not part of the thirty-eight &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; divisions, and should not be confused with them, including the national 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division. The battalions were originally numbered in series from 1 to 325, but in February 1943 were renamed and renumbered from 1 to about 37, to distinguish them from the &quot;Schutzmannschaft&quot; auxiliary battalions recruited from local population in German-occupied areas.
===Invasion of the Soviet Union===

The Order Police battalions, operating both independently and in conjunction with the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, became an integral part of the Final Solution in the two years following the attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Operation Barbarossa. The first mass-murder of 3,000 Jews by Police Battalion 309 occurred in occupied Białystok on 12 July 1941. Police battalions were part of the first and second wave of murders in 1941 and into 1942 throughout the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and also earlier, during the killing operations within the 1939 borders of the USSR – whether as part of Order Police regiments, or as separate units reporting directly to local &quot;SS&quot; and Police Leaders. Over 11,000 members of the Order Police entered the Soviet Union in the wake of the Nazi invasion. They included the Reserve Police Battalion 101 from Hamburg, Battalion 133 of the Nürnberg Order Police, Police Battalions 45, 309 from Köln, 91 and 316 from Bottrop-Oberhausen. These units – among others – carried out extensive murder operations across the Eastern Front. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, this latter role was obscured both by the lack of court evidence and by deliberate obfuscation, while most of the focus was on the better-known &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (&quot;Operational groups&quot;) who reported to the &quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; (RSHA) under Reinhard Heydrich.

Order Police battalions involved in direct killing operations were responsible for at least 1 million murders. Starting in 1941, the regional Order Police units helped to transport Jews from ghettos in both Poland and the USSR (and elsewhere in occupied Europe) to concentration and extermination camps; they also participated in operations to hunt down and murder Jews outside the ghettos. The Order Police and the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were the two primary sources from which the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; drew personnel.

==Waffen-SS Police Division==

The militarization of the police during the war was reflected in the restructuring of police units, with companies replacing traditional formations. In October 1939, a Police Division of 15,800 militarily trained personnel was formed, initially part of the police but made available to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, participating in the 1940 Western Campaign and later restructured as the &quot;SS Polizei&quot; Division officially integrated into the Waffen-SS in 1942. Many members of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;, along with other reservists and men from the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; were organised into the &quot;SS Totenkopfdivision&quot;.
In 1940, the &quot;SS Polizei&quot; Division was stationed along the Maginot Line to provide passive defense and in preparation for the Nazi invasion of France. Eventually the &quot;SS Polizei&quot; Division was called into offensive action, when on 9 June and 10 June, the 1st and 2nd Police Regiments participated in the assault across the Aisne River and the Ardennes Canal where they faced fierce French resistance before the 2nd Police Regiment broke through and took the town of Voncq. The unit was then ordered to advance through the Argonne Forest and again, despite fierce French fighting, managed to capture Les Islettes. Nonetheless, the &quot;SS Polizei&quot; Division was taken out of front-line fighting and placed in reserve near Bar le Duc, but not before they had suffered some 704 casualties in two engagements.

Throughout the course of the war, Himmler established as many as thirty SS-Police regiments for regions occupied by German forces. These units were created to carry out &quot;special tasks&quot; behind the Russian front, and each SS-Police regiment was assigned two armored car and antitank platoons with this &quot;police army&quot; subordinated to HSSPF leaders under Himmler&#x27;s authority. Between 5,500 and 6,000 additional members of the Order Police were dispatched across central and southern Russia, accompanied by the &quot;SS-Einsatzgruppen&quot;. During periods of intense fighting and crisis, these SS-Police units were thrown into the front lines, but normally were used for anti-partisan activities or the mass execution of political prisoners and Jews. 

During the spring of 1944 – after a disastrous year on the Russian front – the 4th &quot;SS-Polizei&quot; Division fought Greek guerrilla forces near Klissura, after which, the division carried out &quot;savage reprisals against the local inhabitants.&quot; The same thing happened at Distomo near Delphi, where members of this division slaughtered men, women, and children alike. Days after the massacre at Distomo, a Red Cross team from Athens &quot;found bodies dangling from the trees that lined the road into the village.&quot;

Nearly 15 percent of all Waffen-SS general officers and colonels, as well as another 11 percent of its lieutenant-colonels and majors, began their careers as policemen.

<text>Microcosmic salt (see infobox for systematic names) is a salt found in urine with the formula Na(NH4)HPO4. It is left behind in the residues after extracting the urea from dried urine crystals with alcohol. In the mineral form, microcosmic salt is called stercorite.

Its name was coined in Latin (&quot;sal microcosmicum&quot;) by Paracelsus in the 16th century, but it was also referenced by Pseudo-Geber in the late Middle Ages; another alchemical name for it was &quot;sal urinae fixum&quot; (as opposed to &quot;sal urinae volatile&quot;). The first extraction of pure phosphorus came from this salt in the 17th century, when Hennig Brandt attempted to extract gold from urine.

Microcosmic salt is used in the laboratory as an essential ingredient of the microcosmic salt bead test for identification of metallic radicals on the basis of the color they produce in oxidizing or reducing flame, in hot or cold conditions.

Microcosmic salts form a tetrahydrate.

<text>The Constitutional Council (; ) is the highest constitutional authority in France. It was established by the Constitution of the Fifth Republic on 4 October 1958 to ensure that constitutional principles and rules are upheld. It is housed in the Palais-Royal in Paris. Its main activity is to rule on whether proposed statutes conform with the Constitution, after they have been voted by Parliament and before they are signed into law by the president of the republic (&quot;a priori&quot; review), or passed by the government as a decree, which has law status in many domains, a right granted to the government under delegation of Parliament.

Since 1 March 2010, individual citizens who are party to a trial or a lawsuit have been able to ask for the council to review whether the law applied in the case is constitutional ( review). In 1971, the council ruled that conformity with the Constitution also entails conformity with two other texts referred to in the preamble of the Constitution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the preamble of the constitution of the Fourth Republic, both of which list constitutional rights.

Members are referred to as &quot;les sages&quot; (&quot;the wise&quot;) in the media and the general public, as well as in the council&#x27;s own documents. Legal theorist Arthur Dyevre notes that this &quot;tends to make those who dare criticise them look unwise.&quot; Since 2016, Laurent Fabius has served as President of the Constitutional Council () following his appointment by President François Hollande.

==Powers and tasks==
===Overview===
The Council has two main areas of power:
# The first is the supervision of elections, both presidential and parliamentary, and ensuring the legitimacy of referendums (Articles 58, 59 and 60). They issue the official results, ensure proper conduct and fairness, and see that campaign spending limits are adhered to. The Council is the supreme authority in these matters. The Council can declare an election to be invalid if improperly conducted, the winning candidate used illegal methods, or the winning candidate spent more than the legal limits for the campaign.
# The second area of council power is the interpretation of the fundamental meanings of the constitution, procedure, legislation, and treaties. The council can declare dispositions of laws to be contrary to the &quot;Constitution of France&quot; or to the principles of constitutional value that it has deduced from the Constitution or from the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot;. It also may declare laws to be in contravention of treaties that France has signed, such as the &quot;European Convention on Human Rights.&quot; Their declaring that a law is contrary to constitutional or treaty principles renders it invalid. The council also may impose reservations as to the interpretation of certain provisions in statutes. The decisions of the council are binding on all authorities.

Examination of laws by the council is compulsory for some acts, such as for organic bills, those which fundamentally affect government, and treaties, which need to be assessed by the council before they are considered ratified (Article 61-1 and 54). Amendments concerning the rules governing parliamentary procedures need to be considered by the council as well. Guidance may be sought from the council in regard to whether reform should come under statute law (voted by Parliament) or whether issues are considered as (regulation) to be adopted with decree of the prime minister. The re-definition of legislative dispositions as regulatory matters initially constituted a significant share of the (then light) caseload of the council.

In the case of other statutes, seeking the oversight of the council is not compulsory. However, the president of the republic, the president of the Senate, the president of the National Assembly, the prime minister of France, 60 members of the National Assembly, or 60 Senators can submit a statute for examination by the council before its signing into law by the president. In general, it is the parliamentary opposition that brings laws that it deems to infringe civil rights before the council.

Another task, of lesser importance in terms of number of referrals, is the reclassification of statute law into the domain of regulations on the prime minister&#x27;s request. This happens when the prime minister and his government wish to alter law that has been enacted as statute law, but should instead belong to regulations according to the Constitution. The prime minister has to obtain reclassification from the council prior to taking any decree changing the regulations. This, however, is nowadays only a small fraction of the council&#x27;s activity: in 2008, out 140 of decisions, only 5 concerned reclassifications.

===Enactment of legislation===
The Government of France consists of an executive branch (President of the Republic, prime minister, ministers and their services and affiliated organisations); a legislative branch (both houses of Parliament); and a judicial branch.

The judicial branch does not constitute a single hierarchy:
* Administrative courts fall under the Council of State, 
* Civil and criminal courts under the Court of Cassation,
* Some entities also have advisory functions.

For historical reasons, there has long been political hostility in the nation to the concept of a &quot;Supreme Court&quot;—that is, a powerful court able to quash legislation, because of the experience of citizens in the pre-Revolutionary era.

Whether the Constitutional Council is a court is a subject of academic discussion, but some scholars consider it effectively the supreme court of France.

The Constitution of the French Fifth Republic distinguishes two kinds of legislation: statute law, which is normally voted upon by Parliament (except for &quot;ordonnances&quot;), and government regulations, which are enacted by the prime minister and his government as decrees and other regulations (&quot;arrêtés&quot;). Article 34 of the Constitution exhaustively lists the areas reserved for statute law: these include, for instance, criminal law.

Any regulation issued by the executive in the areas constitutionally reserved for statute law is unconstitutional unless it has been authorized by a statute as secondary legislation. Any citizen with an interest in the case can obtain the cancellation of these regulations by the Council of State, on grounds that the executive has exceeded its authority. Furthermore, the Council of State can quash regulations on grounds that they violate existing statute law, constitutional rights, or the &quot;general principles of law&quot;.

In addition, new acts can be referred to the Constitutional Council by a petition just prior to being signed into law by the president of the republic. The most common circumstance for this is that 60 opposition members of the National Assembly, or 60 opposition members of the Senate request such a review.

If the prime minister thinks that some clauses of existing statute law instead belong to the domain of regulations, he can ask the council to reclassify these clauses as regulations.

Traditionally, France refused to accept the idea that courts could quash legislation enacted by Parliament (though administrative courts could quash regulations produced by the executive). This reluctance was based in the French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power to refuse to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, politicians believed that, if courts could quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, there would be too much legal uncertainty: how could a citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could &quot;a posteriori&quot; be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying international treaties, including law of the European Union, as superior to national law.

A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as , is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Court of Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law to be unconstitutional, this law is struck down from the law books. The decision applies to everyone and not only to the cases at hand.

==History and evolution==

While since the 19th century the judicial review that the Constitutional Council brings to bear on the acts of the executive branch has played an increasingly large role, the politicians who have framed the successive French institutions have long been reluctant to have the judiciary review legislation. The argument was that un-elected judges should not be able to overrule directly the decisions of the democratically elected legislature. This may also have reflected the poor impression resulting from the political action of the parlements – courts of justice under the ancien régime monarchy: these courts often had chosen to block legislation in order to further the privileges of a small caste in the nation. The idea was that legislation was a political tool, and that the responsibility of legislation should be borne by the legislative body.

Originally, the council was meant to have rather technical responsibilities: ensuring that national elections were fair, arbitrating the division between statute law (from the legislative) and regulation (from the executive), etc. The council role of safekeeping fundamental rights was probably not originally intended by the drafters of the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic: they believed that Parliament should be able to ensure that it did not infringe on such rights. However, the council&#x27;s activity has considerably extended since the 1970s, when questions of justice for larger groups of people became pressing.

From 1958 to 1970, under Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s presidency, the Constitutional Council was sometimes described as a &quot;cannon aimed at Parliament&quot;, protecting the executive branch against encroachment by statute law voted by Parliament. All but one referral to the Constitutional Council came from the prime minister, against acts of Parliament, and the council agreed to partial annulments in all cases. The only remaining referral came from the president of the Senate, Gaston Monnerville, against the 1962 referendum on direct election of the President of the Republic, which Charles de Gaulle supported. The Council ruled that it was &quot;incompetent&quot; to cancel the direct expression of the will of the French people.

In 1971, however, the Council ruled unconstitutional (Decision 71-44DC) some provisions of a law changing the rules for the incorporation of private nonprofit associations, because they infringed on freedom of association, one of the principles of the 1789 &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot;; they used the fact that the preamble of the French constitution briefly referred to those principles to justify their decision. For the first time, a statute was declared unconstitutional not because it infringed on technical legal principles, but because it was deemed to infringe on personal freedoms of citizens.

In 1974, authority to request a constitutional review was extended to 60 members of the National Assembly or 60 senators. Soon, the political opposition seized that opportunity to request the review of all controversial acts.

The Council increasingly has discouraged &quot;riders&quot; (&quot;cavaliers&quot;) – amendments or clauses introduced into bills that have no relationship to the original topic of the bill; for instance, &quot;budgetary riders&quot; in the Budget bill, or &quot;social riders&quot; in the Social security budget bill. &quot;See legislative riders in France&quot;. In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then president of the Constitutional Council, announced that the council would take a stricter view of language of a non-prescriptive character introduced in laws, sometimes known as &quot;legislative neutrons&quot;. Instead of prescribing or prohibiting, as advocated by Portalis, such language makes statements about the state of the world, or wishes about what it should be.

Previously, such language was considered devoid of juridical effects and thus harmless; but Mazeaud contended that introducing vague language devoid of juridical consequences dilutes law unnecessarily. He denounced the use of law as an instrument of political communication, expressing vague wishes rather than effective legislation. Mazeaud also said that, because of the constitutional objective that law should be accessible and understandable, law should be precise and clear, and devoid of details or equivocal formulas. The practice of the Parliament putting into laws remarks or wishes with no clear legal consequences has been a long-standing concern of French jurists.

, one law out of two, including the budget, was sent to the council at the request of the opposition. In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then president of the council, publicly deplored the inflation of the number of constitutional review requests motivated by political concerns, without much legal argumentation to back them on constitutional grounds.

The French constitutional law of 23 July 2008 amended article 61 of the Constitution. It now allows for courts to submit questions of unconstitutionality of laws to the Constitutional Council. The Court of Cassation (supreme court over civil and criminal courts) and the Council of State (supreme court over administrative courts) each filter the requests coming from the courts under them.
&quot;Lois organiques,&quot; and other decisions organizing how this system functions, were subsequently adopted. The revised system was activated on 1 March 2010.

On 29 December 2012, the council said it was overturning an upper income tax rate of 75% due to be introduced in 2013.

==Controversies==
In 1995, Roland Dumas was appointed president of the Council by François Mitterrand. Dumas twice attracted major controversy. First, he was reported as party to scandals regarding the Elf Aquitaine oil company, with many details regarding his mistress, Christine Deviers-Joncour, and his expensive tastes in clothing being published in the press.

In this period, the council issued some highly controversial opinions in a decision related to the International Criminal Court, in Decision 98–408 DC, declaring that the sitting president of the republic could be tried criminally only by the High Court of Justice, a special court organized by Parliament and originally meant for cases of high treason. This, in essence, ensured that Jacques Chirac would not face criminal charges until he left office. This controversial decision is now moot, since the Parliament redefined the rules of responsibility of the president of the republic by the French constitutional law of 23 July 2008. In 1999, because of the Elf scandal, Dumas took official leave from the Council and Yves Guéna assumed the interim presidency.

In 2005, the council again attracted some controversy when Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Simone Veil campaigned for the proposed European Constitution, which was submitted to the French voters in a referendum. Simone Veil had participated in the campaign after obtaining a leave of absence from the council. This action was criticized by some, including Jean-Louis Debré, president of the National Assembly, who thought that prohibitions against appointed members of the council conducting partisan politics should not be evaded by their taking leave for the duration of a campaign. Veil defended herself by pointing to precedent; she said, &quot;How is that his [Debré&#x27;s] business? He has no lesson to teach me.&quot;

==Membership==
The council is made up of former Presidents of the Republic who have chosen to sit in the Council (which they may not do if they become directly involved in politics again) and nine other members who serve non-renewable terms of nine years, one third of whom are appointed every three years, three each by the president of the republic, the president of the National Assembly and the president of the Senate. The president of the Constitutional Council is selected by the president of the republic for a term of nine years. If the position becomes vacant, the oldest member becomes interim president.

Following the 2008 constitutional revision, appointments that the president of the republic makes to the council are subject to a parliamentary approval process, where the relevant committee in the Senate and the National Assembly votes on the appointee. If greater than three-fifths of the members of either committee vote against confirming the appointee, then the appointee must be withdrawn by the president of the republic.

A quorum of seven members is imposed unless exceptional circumstances are noted. Votes are by majority of the members present at the meeting; the president of the council has a casting vote in case of an equal split. For decisions about the incapacity of the president of the republic, a majority of the members of the council is needed.

===Current members===
The members of the Constitutional Council are sworn in by the president of the republic. Former presidents have the option to sit if they choose to do so. The members of the Constitutional Council should abstain from partisanship. They should refrain from making declarations that could lead them to be suspected of partisanship. The possibility for former presidents to sit in the council is a topic of moderate controversy; some see it as incompatible with the absence of partisanship. René Coty, Vincent Auriol, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy are the only former Presidents of France to have sat in the Constitutional Council.

== Publications ==

The council created a periodical in 1996, , from October 2010 (No. 29) . 

This was done in view of a better communication over the council&#x27;s decisions, especially following the 1993 controversy over the decision to strike down a government bill on the right of asylum, during which Prime Minister Édouard Balladur had publicly attacked the institution. Decisions of the council traditionally include an extremely short and purely formal judicial opinion, often relying of plain statements if not tautologies, leaving its rationale and its use of principles and precedents open to interpretation. Before 1996, secretaries general occasionally contributed articles in law reviews in order to clarify the council&#x27;s intents. Starting in 1996, the &quot;Decisions and Documents of the Constitutional Council&quot; section included analyses of recent decisions, formally called &quot;commentaries&quot; from November 2008.

Commentaries became extensive, widely read and used by the legal community and the media. They are written by the council&#x27;s Legal Office and secretary general, and unsigned; they are not approved by the council itself, although the office and secretary general assist with the bulk of the legal research for its decisions. They do not have the force of law, although they are increasingly mentioned in arguments before the council, and occasionally in lower courts. Since 2010, they are no longer published in the subsequent issue of the periodical, but online at the same time as the decision. They are however still commonly referred to as the &quot; commentaries&quot; ().

The purpose of the , as summed up by its then-editor, was also to &quot;express the policy of dialogue of the Constitutional Council with academia as well as with foreign courts&quot;. Each issue included a special feature, as well as an article on a foreign constitutional court, authored by legal scholars and researchers. With the separate publication of commentaries from 2010, it was more clearly turned into a law journal, upon which it became the . It ran until April 2018, with two to four issues every year, published both in print and online.

In September 2018, it was succeeded by , named after , which establishes the council. Publication is exclusively digital, on the council&#x27;s website and on the Cairn.info portal. Two issues are published every year, in the spring and autumn.

The council has released annual reports () since 2016, in French and English.

<doc id="1141262" wikidata="Q4774464" url="?curid=1141262" title="Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003">
<text>The Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 (c.38) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which almost entirely applies only to England and Wales. The Act, championed by then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, was passed in 2003. As well as strengthening the anti-social behaviour order and Fixed Penalty Notice provisions, and banning spray paint sales to people under the age of 16, it gives local councils the power to order the removal of graffiti from private property.

It also specifically addressed truancy, drug houses, false reports of emergency, fireworks, public drunkenness and gang activity.

==Class A drug, supply, distribution or production premises closure orders==
Until October 2014, Part I of the Act (&quot;Premises where drugs used unlawfully&quot;) enabled the police to close residential premises concerned in the use, production or supply of Class A drugs and which were associated with serious nuisance or disorder to members of the public in the preceding three months. After such a notice had been served, within 48 hours a magistrates&#x27; court had to consider the application, and could make a closure order under Section 2, known as a &quot;Class A drug, supply, distribution or production premises closure Order&quot;. The effect of such an order was that no-one could lawfully enter the premises whilst the order was in place, and it became a criminal offence to do so.

==Antisocial behaviour closure orders==

Between December 2008 and October 2014, Part 1A of the Act (&quot;Premises associated with persistent disorder or nuisance&quot;) created the Part 1A closure order or antisocial behaviour closure order. Sections 11A-11L of the 2003 Act permitted the police or local authority to apply to magistrates to close premises where they were satisfied that within the preceding three months the premises had been associated with &quot;significant and persistent disorder or persistent serious nuisance to members of the public.&quot; The order could be made in respect of business or residential premises. Similar to the Part 1 Order (Crack house closure order), it became an offence to remain in or re-enter the premises for the duration of the order.

Parts 1 and 1A were repealed on 20 October 2014 by Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 Sch.11(1) para 41(a).

==Antisocial behaviour injunctions (ASBIs)==
Part II (&quot;Housing&quot;) amended housing legislation to require social housing organisations to adopt and publish policies on anti-social behaviour. It also strengthened the power of registered social landlords (RSLs) to take action against tenants who cause nuisance or annoyance to neighbours. One power was that secure tenancies could be &#x27;demoted&#x27; by order of the County Court, which in theory at least, made eviction easier. A further important provision provided a mechanism for RSLs to apply for injunctions against people causing nuisance and annoyance to people in the neighbourhood of their housing stock. Section 13 of the 2003 Act amended Part V of the Housing Act 1996 (&#x27;Conduct of Tenants&#x27;), by repealing Sections 152 and 153, and inserting new Sections 153A - 153E. Where a person was invited into residential premises by the occupier, in breach of an s.153A injunction, they committed an offence.

Section 153A of the Housing Act 1996 was repealed in March 2015.

==Parenting orders==
Part III (&quot;Parental responsibilities&quot;) amends &#x27;parenting orders&#x27;, which were introduced by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. These are intended to specify steps parents must take to control their children. It also introduces &#x27;parenting contracts&#x27;, which are mainly intended to cover child truancy.

==Dispersal zones==

Between January 2004 and October 2014, Part IV (&quot;Dispersal of groups etc.&quot;) gave the police powers to disperse groups of two or more persons in any public place if their presence &quot;has resulted, or is likely to result, in any members of the public being intimidated, harassed, alarmed or distressed&quot;. There was also a power for a police officer (or PCSO) to accompany any unaccompanied person of under 16 to their home between the hours of 9 pm and 6 am. Section 30 did not apply to lawful pickets, although the human rights implications had been considered by the courts on a number of occasions. The power for police to remove a child under s30 was permissive, not coercive.

Part IV was repealed in October 2014 by Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 Sch.11(1) para 41(c).

==Firearms==

Part V (&quot;Firearms&quot;) amends the Firearms Act 1968 to make possession of an airgun or an imitation weapon in public an offence. The sale of imitation firearms was further limited by section 36 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (VCRA) which made sale of realistic imitation firearms (RIF&#x27;s) an offence. Various groups of people who legitimately use RIF&#x27;s, for work or pleasure, can provide a seller with a defence against prosecution as provided for in section 37 of the VCRA. These groups are set out in regulations made by the Secretary of State, and can be changed at any time.

==The environment==

Part VI (&quot;The Environment&quot;) contains a selection of miscellaneous provisions. It gives councils power to serve a closure order on premises causing public nuisance by noise. Councils also now have the power to serve a &quot;graffiti removal notice&quot; on the person in control (usually the owner) of any surface that is street furniture (such as a telephone box, post box or bus stop) where graffiti has been applied, this legislation does not apply to private property. There is a right of appeal to the magistrates court over such a notice, and one ground for appeal is that &#x27;the defacement is neither detrimental to the amenity of the area nor offensive&#x27;. It makes the sale of aerosol paint to any person under 16 illegal.

==Raves and travellers==

Part VII (&quot;Public Order and Trespass&quot;) amends the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 in two main ways. First, the definition of a &#x27;rave&#x27; is amended so that only 20 people, rather than 100 must be present. Second the powers of police to move unauthorised travellers&#x27; sites are strengthened. This Part also amends the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986 concerning public assemblies. The earlier Act gave the police power to intervene if a public assembly of 20 or more people appeared likely to cause &#x27;serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community&#x27;. This Act reduces the number to two.

==High hedges==

Part VIII (&quot;High Hedges&quot;) is in response to concerns about hedges, typically of Leyland Cypress plants, which can grow to 6 metres or more in height, sometimes cutting out light for neighbours. Such hedges are not controlled by town planning legislation (which normally limits the height of fences to 2 metres), and so there was formerly no way of preventing people from allowing such a hedge to grow. This part of the Act gives local authorities the power to investigate complaints made by people affected by such hedges, and, if necessary, to require their reduction. Councils can charge a fee for dealing with such complaints. Soon after implementation, some councils were charging no fee, while the highest in the country was Sevenoaks, which charged £650.

==Miscellaneous==

Part IX (&quot;Miscellaneous&quot;) makes some changes to the mechanisms for serving and enforcing anti-social behaviour orders. Section 89 extended the powers of Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs). The key changes are that PCSOs have the power to stop a cyclist, and accredited support officers or rail community officers can issue FPNs in respect of a number of offences:
* Use of insulting or abusive behaviour to cause harassment alarm or distress
* Throwing fireworks in a thoroughfare
* Trespassing on a railway
* Throwing stones etc. at trains or other things on railways
* Buying or attempting to buy alcohol for consumption in a bar in licensed premises by a person under 18
* Knowingly giving a false alarm to the fire brigade
* Wasting police time or giving a false report
* Consumption of alcohol in a designated public place
* Using a public communications system for sending messages known to be false in order to cause annoyance.

==Extent==

* Part X (&quot;General&quot;) limits the extent of the legislation to England and Wales only, apart from Part V.

<text>James Cowles Prichard (11 February 1786 – 23 December 1848) was a British physician and ethnologist with broad interests in physical anthropology and psychiatry. His influential &quot;Researches into the Physical History of Mankind&quot; touched upon the subject of evolution. From 1845, Prichard served as a Medical Commissioner in Lunacy. He also introduced the term &quot;senile dementia&quot;.

== Life ==
Prichard was born in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. His parents Thomas and Mary Prichard were Quakers: his mother was Welsh, and his father was of an English family who had emigrated to Pennsylvania, which had been founded by Quakers. Within a few years of his birth in Ross, Prichard&#x27;s parents moved to Bristol, where his father now worked in the Quaker ironworks of Harford, Partridge and Cowles. Upon his father&#x27;s retirement in 1800 he returned to Ross. As a child Prichard was educated mainly at home by tutors and his father, in a range of subjects, including modern languages and general literature.

Rejecting his father&#x27;s wish that he should join the ironworks business, Prichard decided upon a medical career. Here he faced the difficulty that as a Quaker he could not become a member of the Royal College of Physicians. Therefore, he started on apprenticeships that led to the ranks of apothecaries and surgeons, first studying under the Quaker obstetrician Dr Thomas Pole of Bristol. Apprenticeships followed to other Quaker physicians, and to St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London. In 1805, he entered medical school at Edinburgh University, where his religious affiliation was no bar. Also, the Scottish medical schools were held in esteem, having contributed greatly to the Enlightenment of the previous century.

He took his M.D. at Edinburgh, his doctoral thesis of 1808 being his first attempt at the great question of his life: the origin of human varieties and races. Later, he read for a year at Trinity College, Cambridge, after which came a significant personal event: he left the Society of Friends to join the established Church of England. He next moved to St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, afterwards entering as a gentleman commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, but taking no degree in either university.

In 1810 Prichard settled at Bristol as a physician, eventually attaining an established position at the Bristol Infirmary (BRI) in 1816. While working at the BRI, Prichard lived in the Red Lodge. This was also where he wrote &quot;Researches into the Physical History of Man&quot;.

In 1845 he was made one of the three medical Commissioners in Lunacy, having previously been one of the Metropolitan Commissioners, and moved to London. He died there three years later of rheumatic fever. At the time of his death he was president of the Ethnological Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society.

== Work ==
In 1813 he published his &quot;Researches into the Physical History of Man&quot;, in two volumes, on essentially the same themes as his dissertation in 1808. The book grew until the third edition of 1836–1847 occupied five volumes. The second to the fourth editions were published under the title &quot;Researches into the Physical History of Mankind&quot;. The fourth edition was also in five volumes.

The central conclusion of the work is the unity of the human species, which has been acted upon by causes which have since divided it into permanent varieties or races. The work is dedicated to Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, whose five races of man are adopted. Prichard differed from Blumenbach and other predecessors by the principle that people should be studied by combining all available characters.

=== Evolution ===
Three British men, all medically qualified and publishing between 1813 and 1819, William Lawrence, William Charles Wells and Prichard, addressed issues relevant to human evolution. All tackled the question of variation and race in humans; all agreed that these differences were heritable, but only Wells approached the idea of natural selection as a cause.

Science historian Conway Zirkle has described Prichard as an evolutionary thinker who came very close &quot;to explaining the origin of new forms through the operation of natural selection although he never actually stated the proposition in so many words.&quot;

Prichard indicated Africa (indirectly) as the place of human origin, in this summary passage:

:&quot;On the whole there are many reasons which lead us to the conclusion that the primitive stock of men were probably Negroes, and I know of no argument to be set on the other side.&quot;

This opinion was omitted in later editions. The second edition includes more developed evolutionary ideas.

=== Anthropology ===
Prichard was influential in the early days of ethnology and anthropology. He stated that the Celtic languages are allied by language with the Slavonian, German and Pelasgian (Greek and Latin), thus forming a fourth European branch of Indo-European languages. His treatise containing Celtic compared with Sanskrit words appeared in 1831 under the title &quot;Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations&quot;. An essay by Adolphe Pictet, which made its author&#x27;s reputation, was published independently of the earlier investigations of Prichard.

In 1843 Prichard published his &quot;Natural History of Man&quot;, in which he reiterated his belief in the specific unity of man, pointing out that the same inward and mental nature can be recognized in all the races. Prichard was an early member of the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society.

=== Psychiatry ===
In medicine, he specialised in what is now psychiatry. In 1822 he published &quot;A Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous System&quot; (pt. I), and in 1835 a &quot;Treatise on Insanity and Other Disorders Affecting the Mind&quot;, in which he advanced the theory of the existence of a distinct mental illness called moral insanity. Prichard&#x27;s work was also the first definition of senile dementia in the English language. Augstein has suggested that these works were aimed at the prevalent materialist theories of mind, phrenology and craniology. She has also suggested that Prichard was influenced by the somatic school of German Romantic psychiatric thought, in particular Christian Friedrich Nasse, and (eclectically) Johann Christian August Heinroth; this in addition to an acknowledged debt to Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol.

In 1842, following up on moral insanity, he published &quot;On the Different Forms of Insanity in Relation to Jurisprudence, designed for the use of persons concerned in legal questions regarding unsoundness of mind&quot;.

=== Other works ===
Among his other works were:
*1819: &quot;Analysis of Egyptian Mythology&quot;
*1829: &quot;A Review of the Doctrine of a Vital Principle&quot;
*1831: &quot;On the Treatment of Hemiplegia&quot;
*1839: &quot;On the Extinction of some Varieties of the Human Race&quot;

==Family==
He married Anne Maria Estlin, daughter of John Prior Estlin and sister of John Bishop Estlin. They had ten children, eight of whom survived infancy, including Augustin Prichard (b. 1818, d. 1898), Constantine Estlin Prichard (b.1820), Theodore Joseph Prichard (b.1821), Illtiodus Thomas Prichard (b. 1825), Edith Prichard (b. 1829) and Albert Herman Prichard (b.1831).

==Archives==
Documents including medical certificates relating to Prichard and his second son, Augustin Prichard, are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 16082) (online catalogue). Records relating to Prichard can also be found at the Wellcome Library and the Royal Geographical Society.

<doc id="1141266" wikidata="Q977328" url="?curid=1141266" title="William Macewen">
<text>Sir William Macewen ( ; 22 June 1848 – 22 March 1924) was a Scottish surgeon. He was a pioneer in modern brain surgery, considered the &quot;father of neurosurgery&quot; and contributed to the development of bone graft surgery, the surgical treatment of hernia and of pneumonectomy (removal of the lungs).

==Career==
Macewen was born near Port Bannatyne, near Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, in western Scotland in 1848.

He studied Medicine at the University of Glasgow, receiving a medical degree in 1872. He was greatly influenced by Joseph, Lord Lister (1827–1912), who revolutionised surgery by developing antisepsis, by the use of phenol, thus decreasing drastically the enormous mortality of surgical patients due to infections. By following Lister and adopting systematically the use of scrubbing (deep cleansing and disinfection of hands and arms), sterilisation of surgical tools, use of surgical gowns, and (recently discovered) anaesthesia, Macewen became one of the most innovative surgeons of his time and was able to greatly advance modern surgical technique and improve the recovery of patients.

In 1875, he became an assistant surgeon at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, being promoted to full surgeon in 1877. Around 1880 he began a training programme for nurses (focussing on sterilisation) at the infirmary under the charge of the Matron, Mrs Rebecca Strong (1843-1944). In 1881 he was appointed lecturer on Systematic Surgery at the Royal Infirmary School of Medicine. In 1883 he was appointed as Surgeon to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. In 1892 Macewen became Regius Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow (the post which Lister had held when Macewen was a student) and transferred his surgical activities to the Western Infirmary. In 1896, Macewan was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours for services to medicine, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year.

In 1916 Macewen helped to found the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers in Erskine (now the Erskine Hospital), near Glasgow, which was urgently needed to treat the thousands of military who had lost their limbs in the First World War. Macewen was its first chief surgeon and with the help of engineers and workers at the nearby Yarrow Shipbuilders he designed the Erskine artificial limb. He trained a team of pattern-makers to manufacture them for the hospital. Macewen recruited the first matron for Erskine, Agnes Carnochan Douglas, who he had worked with in the Western Infirmary in Glasgow.

Macewen died in Glasgow on 22 March 1924. He lived at Garrochty on the Isle of Bute until his death and was buried nearby in the churchyard of St Blane&#x27;s Church at Kingarth.

==Neurosurgery==
Following the work of John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911) and David Ferrier (1843–1924) on neurological mapping of functions in the brain, Macewen demonstrated in 1876 that it was possible to use a precise clinical examination to determine the possible site of a tumour or lesion in the brain, by observing its effects on the side and extension of alterations in motor and sensory functions. Thus, in 1876 he diagnosed an abscess in the frontal lobe of a boy, but the family refused permission to operate. When the patient died his diagnosis and localisation were found to be correct.

In 1879 he performed the first successful intracranial surgery where the site of the lesion (a left frontal meningioma) was localized solely by the preoperative focal epileptic signs (twitching of the face and arms in the opposite side of the lesion). On the basis of these signs Macewen thought that there was good evidence of an &quot;irritation to the lower and middle portions of the ascending convolutions…in the left frontal lobe&quot;. A trephined hole in the skull near the purported site of the lesion showed a big subdural tumour. The patient, a teenage girl, lived for eight more years, and a subsequent autopsy showed no trace of the tumour. He later used this many times to successfully operate on brain abscesses (in 1876) and hematomas and on the spine. This was a great triumph of medicine.

According to one of his biographers, &quot;his thorough knowledge of the natural history of pyogenic diseases of the temporal bone and nasal sinuses, in addition to his clear description of cranial anatomy, as illustrated in his &quot;Atlas of Head Sections&quot;, were especially important in developing his successful treatment of brain abscess. The X-ray had not yet been discovered; Macewen&#x27;s diagnosis was based on clinical findings superbly illustrated by his three clinical stages of brain abscess development.&quot; (Canale, 1996).

==Contributions to surgery==

One of his earliest contributions while at the Royal Infirmary, in 1877, was in orthopaedics, by means of the development of the first bone grafts, but also in knee surgery using a special instrument (Macewen&#x27;s osteotome) both techniques becoming key treatments for the highly prevalent disease of rickets (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Macewen was interested in the biology of bone and carried out a classical series of experiments on animals in order to determine how bones grow and may be repaired. He developed surgical treatments for mastoid disease and pyogenic cysts of the temporal bone and has identified an anatomical structure in this bone, the foveola suprameatica, which was named MacEwen&#x27;s triangle in his honour.

His method of surgical removal of lungs became a major medical weapon in the treatment of tuberculosis and lung cancer, thus saving many patients. His name was also immortalised in Medicine in two other instances: the Macewen&#x27;s operation for inguinal hernia and the Macewen&#x27;s sign for hydrocephalus and brain abscess.

Another important contribution by Macewen to modern surgery was the technique of endotracheal anaesthesia with the help of orotracheal intubation, which he described in 1880, and still in use today.

Macewen was noted for his early and creative use of photographs for documenting patients&#x27; cases and for teaching surgery and medicine. He pioneered the use of photos of body parts and pathological specimens, as well as photos taken before, after and during treatment/surgery.

==Honours==
* Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (1874)
* Fellow of the Royal Society (1895)
* Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (1900)
* President of the British Medical Association (1922)
* Knighted (1902)
* Companion of the Order of the Bath (1917)

After his death, a memorial fund was set up in his name. As part of the late 1970s redevelopment of Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where Macewen spent most of his career, a new laboratory block was named in his honour. It opened in 1981.

<text>Daniel Hack Tuke (19 April 18275 March 1895) was an English physician and expert on mental illness.

==Family==
Tuke came from a long line of Quakers from York who were interested in mental illness and concerned with those afflicted. His great-grandfather William Tuke and his grandfather Henry Tuke co-founded the Retreat, which revolutionized the treatment of insane people.

His father Samuel Tuke carried on the work of the York Retreat and reported on its methods and its results. Daniel&#x27;s older brother James Hack Tuke (1819–1896) was the next overseer of the York Retreat. Daniel was the youngest son of Samuel Tuke and Priscilla Hack, his wife.

Tuke&#x27;s son was the painter Henry Scott Tuke.

==Career==
In 1845 Daniel Tuke entered the office of a solicitor at Bradford, but in 1847 began work at the York Retreat. Entering St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London in 1850, he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1852, and graduated M.D. at Heidelberg in 1853.

In 1853 he visited a number of foreign asylums, and later returning to York he became visiting physician to the York Retreat and the York Dispensary, lecturing also to the York School of Medicine on mental diseases.

In 1859 ill health obliged him to give up his work, and for the next fourteen years he lived at Falmouth. In 1875, he settled in London as a specialist in mental diseases.

In 1858, in collaboration with John Charles Bucknill, he published a &quot;Manual of Psychological Medicine&quot;, which was for many years regarded as a standard work on lunacy. In 1872 he published his most influential and popular book &quot;On the Influence of the Mind upon the Body in Health and Disease&quot;. In 1880 he became joint editor of the &quot;Journal of Mental Science&quot;. In 1892 – in cooperation with many others as contributors, including the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot – he edited a &quot;Dictionary of Psychological Medicine&quot; in 2 volumes.

==Marriage==
In 1853 he married Esther Maria Stickney (1826–1917). They had three children, the second son being Henry Scott Tuke RA (1858–1929).

==Death==
He died on 5 March 1895 and was buried at the Quaker Burial Ground, Saffron Walden.

<text>Sandra Colleen Waites (15 December 1948 – 28 December 1991), known professionally as Cassandra Harris, was an Australian actress.

== Early life ==
Born in Sydney, Harris was a student at the National Institute of Dramatic Art. She enrolled in 1961, aged 12, under the name Sandra Gleeson. She went on to perform in the Sydney stage production of &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; (1964–1965).

Harris appeared in &quot;The Greek Tycoon&quot; (1978), &quot;Rough Cut&quot; (1980), and the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981) as the Countess Lisl von Schlaf, the ill-fated mistress of Milos Columbo (played by Israeli actor Topol). While filming this movie, her third husband, Pierce Brosnan, met producer Albert R. Broccoli. Her dream was for Brosnan to become Bond and encouraged him to pursue the role. He was supposed to take over from Roger Moore after impressing Broccoli in his role in the TV series &quot;Remington Steele&quot;. He agreed to take the role but producers from the TV show refused to release him from his contract, he eventually was cast in the role in the early 90&#x27;s and would proceed to play James Bond in four films. She guest-starred in several episodes of the television series &quot;Remington Steele&quot; with Brosnan; they married on 27 December 1980.

== Personal life and death ==
Harris had three children: Charlotte Harris (1971–2013) and Christopher Harris (b. 1972) by Dermot Harris, brother of actor Richard Harris, and son Sean Brosnan (b. 1983), by Pierce Brosnan, who adopted Charlotte and Christopher after their father died in 1986.

In 1987, Harris was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, the same disease that had claimed her own mother&#x27;s life. She had the illness for four years until her death on 28 December 1991, at the age of 43. Her daughter Charlotte also died from ovarian cancer on 28 June 2013, aged 41.

<text>The Emergencies Act () is a statute passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1988 which authorizes the Government of Canada to take extraordinary temporary measures to respond to public welfare emergencies, public order emergencies, international emergencies and war emergencies. The law replaces the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; passed in 1914. It asserts that any government action continues to be subject to the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;.

Under the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;, the Cabinet of Canada can declare a national emergency in response to an urgent and critical situation that cannot be dealt with by any existing law, and either is beyond the capability of a province to deal with it or threatens the sovereignty of Canada. Before declaring a national emergency, the federal cabinet must consult with provincial cabinets. In the case of a public welfare or public order emergency where the effects of the emergency are confined to, or occur principally in, one province, the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; cannot be used if the provincial cabinet does not indicate that the situation is beyond the capacity of the province to deal with it. Once an emergency is declared, it is subject to confirmation by the House of Commons and Senate.

The &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; has been invoked only once since it was enacted in 1988, in response to the Canada convoy protest in 2022.

== History ==
=== Impetus and reform proposals ===

The impetus for reform of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; came in October 1970 when members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped Pierre Laporte (the provincial labour minister) and British diplomat James Cross. These events, called the October Crisis, resulted in Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoking the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; for the first time during peacetime. During the October Crisis, concerns were raised in Parliament about instances of possible abuse of civil rights, and ineffective flow of information from Cabinet to Parliament.

Trudeau responded to the calls for reform during the October Crisis, stating on November 3, 1970, and January 11, 1971, that Parliament would consider creating new emergency legislation; however, new emergency legislation was not introduced while Trudeau was in office. Parliament considered forming a joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons to deliberate new emergency legislation in 1971 and 1977; however, both efforts were unsuccessful as agreement could not be reached on whether the mandate of such a committee would include an evaluation of the government&#x27;s use of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; in the October Crisis.

As new information came to light on the activities of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police&#x27;s (RCMP) actions during the October Crisis, the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP (McDonald Commission) was formed in 1977. Among the McDonald Commission&#x27;s recommendations in its 1981 final report were several changes to Canada&#x27;s emergency powers. The McDonald Commission recommended the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; be amended to focus on powers necessary during times of war, invasion or insurrection, while other emergencies would be dealt with by &quot;ad hoc&quot; legislation. The commission also recommended that the role of Parliament be increased during emergencies, including the requirement that Parliament confirm the state of emergency, renew the state of emergency, and, if not sitting, that it be summoned within seven days to make such a declaration. The commission further called for the information used by the government to declare an emergency be presented to Parliament publicly, with sensitive or classified materials being provided to an appropriate committee or during an &quot;in camera&quot; session of Parliament (private session). The McDonald Commission also called for: the power to create a new court to hear complaints from individuals whose rights had been infringed; the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; to state which elements of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; would be notwithstanding during a declaration; and that Article 4 rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights never to be overridden.

Despite the McDonald Commission report being completed and released publicly in 1981, it was never tabled in Parliament or fully debated. The Task Force on Canadian Unity, established by the Government of Canada after the sovereigntist Parti Québécois was elected in Quebec in 1976 also called for reform of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, including a declaration of use providing the rationale, greater parliamentary oversight, safeguards for provincial powers, and safeguards for individual liberties.

Despite the calls and proposals for reform of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; following the October Crisis, there was no change until the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; was passed by Parliament in 1988. The Progressive Conservative Party under Brian Mulroney defeated the Liberal government under John Turner in the 1984 Canadian federal election, and in 1987 the Mulroney government released a white paper on reforming Canada&#x27;s defence policy. It called for the creation of comprehensive emergency legislation, and the government commissioned a series of studies on emergency and defence topics. The studies considered four options for emergency legislation and recommended that a single comprehensive law be provided with four unique types of emergencies with unique powers, procedures and safeguards.

=== Legislative history ===
The &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; was introduced by Minister of National Defence Perrin Beatty in the second session of the 33rd Canadian Parliament as Bill C-77. Its first reading was on June 26, 1987, and second reading was on November 2, 1987. The bill received royal assent on July 21, 1988, replacing the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. Parliament intended it to provide more civil rights protections and less likelihood for abuse of power than the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;.

A number of amendments were made to Bill C-77 between the second and third readings. The definition of &quot;national emergency&quot; and the situations under which the bill could be invoked was defined more restrictively to limit broad use. The definition which passed second reading was removed, &quot;an urgent and critical situation of a temporary nature that imperils the well-being of Canada as a whole or that is of such proportions or nature as to exceed the capacity or authority of a province to deal with it&quot; and replaced with two possible conditions, one which &quot;seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians and is of such proportions or nature as to exceed the capacity or authority of a province to deal with it&quot; or a condition which threatens the sovereignty of Canada. The reasoning for the change was the understanding that many emergencies were &quot;urgent&quot;, &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;temporary&quot;, but not sufficient in gravity for use of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;. Another amendment made after second reading allowed government decisions under a declared emergency to be reviewed by the courts based on whether the actions taken were reasonable.

== Provisions ==
Under the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;, the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal cabinet) may declare that an emergency exists. The emergency must be a &quot;national emergency&quot;, which means an &quot;urgent and critical situation of a temporary nature&quot; that either &quot;(a) seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians and is of such proportions or nature as to exceed the capacity or authority of a province to deal with it, or (b) seriously threatens the ability of the Government of Canada to preserve the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of Canada and that cannot be effectively dealt with under any other law of Canada&quot;.

The &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; contemplates four distinct types of emergencies: a public welfare emergency, a public order emergency, an international emergency, and a war emergency. It uses a &quot;finely graded set of provisions&quot; to respond to each type. The four categories of emergency are triggered in separate circumstances and a declaration of an emergency under each category gives the government a separate set of powers. Once Cabinet has declared an emergency, it can make orders in council or proclaim regulations pursuant to the declaration.

Under the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;, a declaration of an emergency by the Cabinet must be reviewed by Parliament. Any temporary laws made under the act are subject to the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;, and must have regard to the &quot;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&quot;.

Once a national emergency is declared, a motion for confirmation of a declaration of emergency must be tabled in the Senate and House of Commons within seven days after a declaration of emergency is made by the Governor in Council. If either chamber is prorogued or in recess, its members must be recalled. If both chambers adopt the motion, the declared emergency remains in place for its original duration, subject to renewal (also subject to parliamentary scrutiny). Either chamber may end the emergency declaration by voting against it. Additionally, a Parliamentary Review Committee with representation from each recognized party must be formed. Within 60 days of the expiration of the emergency, the law requires the government to convene a public inquiry and table a report in Parliament within 360 days following the emergency&#x27;s expiration.

=== Public welfare emergency ===
Part I of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; describes &quot;public welfare emergencies&quot; which result, or may result, in danger to life or property, services or resources, so serious as to be a national emergency. Public welfare emergencies include natural hazards such as fire, flood, drought, storm, or earthquakes; biological hazards including disease affecting humans, animals or plants; and man-made hazards such as accidents or pollution.

Section 7 of the act states a public welfare emergency declaration persists for 90 days, subject to being extended through another proclamation, or ended earlier.

=== Public order emergency ===
Part II of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; describes &quot;public order emergency&quot; results from serious threats to the security of Canada. When defining &quot;threats to the security of Canada&quot;, the act references the definition provided in the &quot;Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act&quot;, which includes espionage, sabotage, detrimental foreign influences, activities which support the threat or use of violence for a political, religious or ideological objective; or those activities which threaten to undermine or otherwise destroy, or overthrow the Government of Canada. The &quot;Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act&quot; notes that &quot;lawful advocacy, protest or dissent&quot; do not constitute &quot;threats to the security of Canada&quot;.

Section 18 of the act states a public order emergency declaration persists for 30 days, subject to being extended through another proclamation, or ended earlier.

=== International emergency ===
Part III of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; describes &quot;international emergency&quot;, which results from acts of intimidation, coercion, or the real or imminent use of force from one or more other countries against Canada. An international emergency would fall short of an armed conflict which would permit a &quot;war emergency&quot;, instead the international emergency was proposed for times of &quot;heightened international tensions&quot; and &quot;rapid deterioration of relations among nations&quot;. Peter Rosenthal likened the purpose of an international emergency to events similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Under an international emergency, additional powers are provided to the government as it relates to supplies for national defence, including search and seizure as it relates to scarce commodities, hoarding, black market operations and fraud.

Section 29 of the act states an international emergency declaration persists for 60 days, subject to being extended through another proclamation, or ended earlier.

=== War emergency ===
Part IV of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; describes a &quot;war emergency&quot; which results from war or armed conflict involving Canada or an allied nation. While a &quot;war emergency&quot; provides the government with significant authority to make orders or regulation beyond the categorical limits of other emergencies, however, a war emergency does not provide the authority to implement conscription under the act.

Section 39 of the act states a war emergency declaration persists for 120 days, subject to being extended through another proclamation, or ended earlier.

== Analysis ==
According to the legal scholars Craig Forcese and Leah West, the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; provides for &quot;the stiffest government emergency powers of any emergency law in Canada&quot;.

The &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; does not delineate what role the courts may play during an emergency. Forcese and Aaron Freeman suggest that this leaves intact courts&#x27; ordinary powers of judicial review in Canadian administrative law and constitutional review under the &quot;Charter&quot;. Legal scholar Robert Martin argues that the act&#x27;s requirement that the Governor in Council have &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; to believe that an emergency exists &quot;leaves open the possibility of judicial review of the invocation of emergency powers&quot;.

Irvin Studin traces the federal government&#x27;s power under the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; to the peace, order, and good government clause in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

==Uses==

The &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; has been used once, in response to the Canada convoy protest in 2022. The &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, which the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; replaced, was used on three occasions: during both the First and Second World Wars, and during the 1970 October Crisis.

=== Proposed use in response to the COVID-19 pandemic ===

On April 9, 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent a letter to the provincial and territorial premiers to consult about invoking the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. While consultation with the provinces is a required step before a national emergency can be declared, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office said there was no present plan to invoke it and that doing so remained a last resort. On a conference call between Trudeau and the premiers later that day, the premiers communicated their unanimous opposition to invoking the act.

=== Canada convoy protest ===

On February 14, 2022, during the Canada convoy protest, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s government declared a public order emergency, invoking the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; for the first time.

Under the &quot;Emergency Measures Regulations&quot; issued after the declaration of emergency, participation in public assemblies that could result in a breach of peace by disrupting the movements of goods and people, interfering with the operation of critical infrastructure, or by supporting violence, were prohibited. Travel to and within places where these rallies were occurring was restricted, and foreigners were barred from coming to Canada to attend them. The regulations also specifically outlawed the bringing of children under the age of 18 to these assembles. Additionally the use, provision, collection, and solicitation of property and funds to support the prohibited assemblies or the people participating in them was banned.

The regulations further empowered the federal government to protect critical infrastructure, Parliament Hill and the parliamentary precinct, official government residences and buildings, war monuments, and any other places designated by the minister of public safety. The federal government was also given the authority to compel the towing and removal of vehicles, structures, and other objects used in blockades. Violations of the regulations was punishable by up to five years&#x27; imprisonment, a fine up to $5,000, or both.

Under the &quot;Emergency Economic Measures Order&quot;, also issued pursuant to the declaration of emergency, crowdfunding platforms and their payment processors were required to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, and report large and suspicious transactions. Cryptocurrencies were also included in the expanded financial regulations. Banks were ordered to freeze personal and corporate bank accounts suspected of being used by people violating the regulations, and were protected from civil liability in enforcing the order. Insurance coverage for trucks being used in blockades was suspended. Furthermore, financial institutions had to determine on a continuing basis whether any persons violating the regulations were using their services and were required to promptly report findings to the RCMP or the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).

In accordance with the requirements of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; the government introduced a motion for the confirmation of the declaration of emergency on February 17, and debate was planned to continue through the weekend with a vote scheduled for February 21 at 8:00 pm. Though interrupted by police operations against the protesters on February 18, debate otherwise proceeded as planned and the House of Commons voted to confirm use of the act 185 to 151, with the Liberals and New Democratic Party (NDP) in support, and the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois voting against the motion. Immediately after the vote, interim Conservative leader Candice Bergen filed a motion to revoke the declaration of emergency under section 59. Debate in the Senate began on February 22, with members required to take an oath of secrecy. A vote was expected as early as that evening but debate proved more contentious than anticipated with several senators challenging the government to disclose the basis for invoking and continuing the state of emergency, even as blockades and protests had been cleared.

==== Reactions ====
The announcement had varied reactions. Several provincial premiers expressed concerns, including the premiers of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Quebec. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, the centre of the protest, expressed support for the measure. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh supported the measure, but said that its invocation was &quot;proof of failure of leadership&quot;. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association criticized the declaration of emergency, saying that the &quot;high and clear&quot; threshold for invocation that the situation cannot be resolved through the regular application of existing laws had not been met, and that normalization of emergency legislation would erode democracy and civil liberties. On February 18, it filed for judicial review of the government&#x27;s decision to invoke the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;, claiming the invocation was unjustified and unconstitutional. The Canadian Constitution Foundation (CCF) announced intent to sue on similar grounds. On February 19, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney also said that the province would file a court challenge to the federal government&#x27;s use of the law. A few days later, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said that his province was also considering a court challenge. On February 20, Edward Snowden compared the freezing of bank accounts to similar actions by the Chinese and Russian governments, and commended the Canadian Civil Liberties Association for its challenge to the use of the law.

==== Opinion polling ====
Opinion polling conducted by Maru Public Opinion showed that 66 per cent of Canadians supported the use of the act. Support was highest in British Columbia, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada, with 75 per cent, 72 per cent, and 72 per cent of the populations in those regions supporting the invocation respectively, and with a majority in every province backing the use of the act. A poll by Mainstreet Research, conducted slightly later, on February 16 and 17, measured overall support and opposition at 51 per cent and 44 per cent respectively. Abacus Data found support at 57 per cent and opposition at 30 per cent in poll conducted between February 17 and 22. A poll conducted by Research Co between February 18 and the 20 found that 66 per cent believed the use of the act was justified, against 28 per cent who did not. A poll conducted by Nanos Research on February 23 and 24, after the declaration of emergency had been revoked, found support for the liberals&#x27; decision to invoke the act was at 63 per cent, and opposition at 36 per cent. Retrospective polling conducted by Angus Reid in May showed that 46 per cent of Canadians thought that the use of the act was necessary to clear out the protesters, 34 per cent thought that the police had sufficient powers to clear it without invoking the act, and 15 per cent opposed any government action to clear out the protesters. 

==== Revocation ====
On February 23, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that the federal government would revoke the emergency declaration. Debate in the Senate was halted after the announcement. Later that day, the governor general signed a proclamation revoking it.

Despite its revocation, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the province of Alberta said they would proceed with challenges to the use of the law. In April, in response to disclosure requests in the legal challenge, the Canadian government declined to disclose documents related to the use of the act, citing cabinet confidentiality. The documents included Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino&#x27;s submissions on the factual and legal basis for the invocation, records of the alternatives considered and rejected, and a record of the cabinet&#x27;s decisions (possibly including a tally of the final cabinet vote).

==== Parliamentary review committee ====
In March, a joint parliamentary committee named the Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of Emergency (DEDC) began investigating the use of the act. The committee is composed of seven members of Parliament and four senators.

Various government officials testified before the committee on April 26, including Canadian Security Intelligence Service Director David Vigneault, RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino, and Minister of Justice David Lametti. Both Mendicino and Lametti invoked cabinet confidentiality in refusing to answer some questions.

==== Rouleau inquiry ====

On April 25, 2022, Trudeau appointed Justice Paul Rouleau as commissioner of an inquiry into the invocation of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;. The inquiry is independent of the parliamentary review committee. By law, the inquiry was required to complete its report and submit it to Parliament by February 20, 2023. The inquiry was scheduled initially to start on September 19 and run until October 28. Due to Justice Rouleau undergoing surgery, the inquiry was delayed, and the public hearings ran from October 13 to December 2.

A government press release said it is hoped investigations would &quot;prevent these events from happening again&quot;. Conservatives said the investigations were too focused on the actions of protesters and their fundraising, and not on justifying the use of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; or determining whether it was appropriate for it to have been invoked.

On February 17, 2023, Justice Rouleau released his 2,000-page final report, finding that the Trudeau government met the &quot;very high threshold&quot; for invoking the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; after failures by police and politicians to address the protests. Rouleau wrote that he reached his conclusion “with reluctance,” and that reasonable and informed people could come to a different conclusion. Rouleau found that the freezing of bank accounts should have included a &quot;delisting mechanism&quot; and that it was unjust for individuals with no connection to the protests to be affected, but called that &quot;unavoidable&quot;. Rouleau criticized Trudeau for labelling the protesters a &quot;fringe minority&quot; during the protest, writing that the comments likely hardened their resolve and embittered them.

Rouleau also made various recommendations to the government to improve policing, information sharing, and amend the Act, asking the government to provide its response within a year of his report. Following the announcement, Trudeau said the government would respond within six months of the report. In August 2023, a government spokesperson said an update would be coming in &quot;the coming days&quot;. A year after the report was released, no government response had been provided. In March 2024, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government would need more time to respond, citing its appeal of a Federal Court ruling, and indicating steps could be taken at some point in the future.

==== Federal Court ruling ====

On January 23, 2024, Judge Richard Mosley of the Federal Court ruled that the use of the Emergencies Act was unreasonable, &quot;ultra vires&quot;, and that the Crown had violated Section 2(b) and Section 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The court found that orders made under the act were &quot;overbroad&quot; infringing on the freedom of expression of protesters who did not intend to breach the peace, and that collecting of financial information from banks and freezing of bank accounts had amounted to unreasonable search and seizure.

When asked about the ruling on the day of its release, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland defended her government&#x27;s actions, saying it was the correct decision at the time, and announced their intention to appeal. In February 2024, the government appealed the ruling.

<doc id="1141280" wikidata="Q7753590" url="?curid=1141280" title="The New Equinox">
<text>The New Equinox was a ceremonial magic publication founded in the mid-1970s by Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin, whose main interest at that time was the magic of Aleister Crowley. It was published between 1976 and 1979. The magazine was based in East Morton in Yorkshire. Anthony Venables was joint editor for a few issues. He has a book shop on Haworth Main Street. Carroll, who later went on, with Ray Sherwin, to found the &quot;Illuminates of Thanateros&quot;, was a regular contributor.

The first report of the system known as English Qaballa (EQ) was published in &quot;The New Equinox&quot; in 1979 by Ray Sherwin in his final issue as editor. In an editorial, Sherwin reported that the &quot;order &amp; value of the English Alphabet&quot; had been discovered by an English magician, James Lees, in November 1976. 

James Lees subsequently assumed the role of publisher of &quot;The New Equinox&quot; and, starting in 1981, published additional material about the EQ system over the course of five issues of the journal, extending into 1982.

<text>Lynn-Holly Johnson is an American retired figure skater and former actress. After achieving some success as a figure skater in the mid-1970s, she began an acting career, including a Golden Globe-nominated role in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Ice Castles&quot; and her role as Bibi Dahl in the 1981 James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Lynn Holly Johnson was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Margaret, a housewife, and Alan Johnson, a general contractor. Johnson added the hyphen to her name after her roommate wrote Johnson&#x27;s name that way. She graduated from Niles North High School in Skokie, Illinois.

Johnson won the silver medal at the novice level of the 1974 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. She gave up competitive skating in 1977 to turn professional and join the Ice Capades, and subsequently began an acting career, making her film debut in &quot;Ice Castles&quot;, in which she portrayed Alexis &quot;Lexie&quot; Winston, a figure skater who is blinded by a blood clot in her brain. The film, a romantic drama co-starring Robby Benson, was a minor success in December 1978, grossing $18 million in the US. Johnson, who was described as &quot;an appealing young woman who actually happens to be a good skater who can act&quot; by film critic Roger Ebert, was nominated for a Golden Globe as &quot;Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress&quot; for her performance in the film. 

Johnson was subsequently cast in the lead role of the Disney horror drama &quot;The Watcher in the Woods&quot;. The film received a limited release in April 1980, but it was soon withdrawn and not given a wider release until October 1981. Also in 1981, Johnson had a minor supporting role as Bibi Dahl in the James Bond movie &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; . In &quot;For Your Eyes Only,&quot; she played a figure skater who has a crush on James Bond, played by Roger Moore. In 1984, Johnson starred in &quot;Where the Boys Are &#x27;84&quot;, a remake of the 1960 film of the same name. The film was a critical and box-office failure.

In 1996, Johnson retired from acting to concentrate on her family; her last acting role at that time was a made-for-television film, &quot;Fugitive X: Innocent Target&quot;. 

In 2007, she returned to acting in a community theater production of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.

==Personal life==
Johnson currently lives with her husband and their two children in Los Angeles, California. In January 2010, Johnson suffered a stroke while on a flight from Florida to Los Angeles. Upon medical intervention, Johnson learned that the stroke had been brought on by a patent foramen ovale, a congenital heart defect that had gone undiagnosed. She subsequently underwent open heart surgery to treat the condition.

Johnson&#x27;s daughter, Jensie, is a competitive gymnast and a member of the Alabama Crimson Tide gymnastics team.

<text>Leila Hyams (May 1, 1905 – December 4, 1977) was an American actress who came from a show business family. Her relatively short film career began in 1924 during the era of silent films and ended in 1936 (excepting a 1946 film short appearance). The blonde blue-eyed ingenue and leading lady appeared in more than 50 film roles and remained a press favourite, with numerous magazine covers.

==Early life==
She was born in New York City to vaudeville comedy performers John Hyams and Leila McIntyre, who performed as the duo &quot;Hyams and McIntyre&quot; Her mother was a noted Broadway performer, and both her parents appeared in films. They can be seen together in several Hollywood films, primarily in minor supporting roles or uncredited appearances, including &quot;The Housekeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1939).

Hyams appeared on stage with her parents while still a child, working in their vaudeville act for five years, but unable to establish a successful theatre career, she turned to modelling, modelling clothing, cosmetics and dental care.

By 1928, Hyams was playing starring roles, achieving success in MGM&#x27;s first talkie release, &quot;Alias Jimmy Valentine&quot; (1928) opposite William Haines, Lionel Barrymore, and Karl Dane. The following year, she appeared in the popular murder mystery &quot;The Thirteenth Chair&quot;, a role that offered her the chance to display her dramatic abilities as a murder suspect. At Fox that same year, she appeared in director Allan Dwan&#x27;s now lost romantic adventure &quot;The Far Call&quot; opposite Charles Morton.She had a role as Robert Montgomery&#x27;s sister in the prison drama &quot;The Big House&quot; (1930) with Chester Morris and Wallace Beery. She then appeared in &quot;Surrender&quot; (1931) in which Warner Baxter and Ralph Bellamy desperately competed for her attention.

Hyams acted in two early 1930s horror movies, as the wise-cracking but kind-hearted circus performer Venus in &quot;Freaks&quot; (1932) and as the heroine in the Charles Laughton/Bela Lugosi film &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot; (1932). She also appeared in the then-controversial Jean Harlow film &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; (1932) and the musical comedy &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1932) with Bing Crosby, George Burns, and Gracie Allen.

==Personal life==

, Hyams&#x27; last film.
Hyams married her Hollywood talent agent, Phil Berg, in 1927. In 1936, after a 12-year acting career and performing in 50 films, she retired from the motion-picture industry; nevertheless, she remained active in the Hollywood community for the rest of her life. In 1977, after a brief illness, Hyams died at age 72 at her home in Bel-Air in Los Angeles. She was survived by her husband, Phil.

<text>Friedrich Baum (1727 – 18 August 1777) was a senior officer of Brunswick–Luneburg troops who commanded dragoons in the Northern Theater of the American War of Independence. Baum was mortally wounded at the Battle of Bennington.

== American War of Independence ==
Baum served under another German officer, Major General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, commanding the of the () in support of General John Burgoyne&#x27;s 1777 campaign to attack the Lake Champlain-Hudson River corridor, which ended in Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender at Saratoga, New York on October 15, 1777.

For Baum, the campaign ended at the Battle of Bennington, on August 16, 1777. Arriving in Canada with the Brunswick army in the winter of 1776, Burgoyne detailed Baum with around 600 Brunswickers, British, and Indians from Fort Edward to try to collect provisions, horses, and Loyalist reinforcements for Burgoyne&#x27;s main force for the march south toward Albany. However, nearly 2,000 rebels, consisting of New Hampshire forces under John Stark and the remnants of Seth Warner&#x27;s Green Mountain Boys following the costly Battle of Hubbardton, were arrayed against Baum&#x27;s men. Also among Stark&#x27;s forces were Massachusetts men under Reverend Thomas Allen, leading a contingent of Pittsfield militia. Allen, who had been outraged at the abandonment of Fort Ticonderoga to Burgoyne at the beginning of July, complained to Stark that if his men did not get to fight at Bennington they would never answer another call to arms.

Although Baum had served in several engagements in Europe during the Seven Years&#x27; War, he had little battlefield command experience. In contrast, his adversary Stark had served with Robert Rogers&#x27; Rangers, including the Battle of Ticonderoga; and he had distinguished himself as an American leader at Bunker Hill, Trenton, and Princeton.

Baum&#x27;s lack of experience showed at Bennington, where he encamped his forces in such a way that they were separated and unable to communicate easily with each other. Communications were also hampered in some degree by the inability of Baum, who spoke only German, to speak English.

Baum had been assigned a loyalist from the nearby region to guide his forces and attest to the character of any indigenous people encountered along the way. According to a field report that was later published in the London Gazette by Burgoyne himself:

Putting his superior numbers to best use, Stark surrounded each of Baum&#x27;s forces and attacked simultaneously, overwhelming each redoubt. In the melée, Baum was captured after sustaining a mortal stomach wound, from which his surgeon, Julius Friedrich Wasmus, also captured, was unable to save him.

Seeing he was badly outnumbered, Baum had requested reinforcements from Burgoyne, who sent Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann and a corps of light infantrymen and Brunswick grenadiers to support him. However, Breymann, who disliked Baum, marched slowly to the site, making less than one mile per hour, arriving after Baum had already been overrun and captured.

== Honours ==
Colonel Baum Road, which runs through the Washington County, New York town of Easton, just south of the Village of Greenwich, is named for him.

<doc id="1141303" wikidata="Q5358449" url="?curid=1141303" title="Electronic voting in Canada">
<text>Federal elections use hand-counted paper ballots. Provincial elections use paper ballots, some provinces have introduced computer ballot counting (vote tabulators), and the Northwest Territories has experimented with Internet voting for absentee voting. Paper ballots with computer vote tabulators have been used since at least the 1990s at the municipal level.

A federal committee has recommended against national Internet voting. Committee reports and analysis from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia have all recommended against provincial Internet voting.

Elections Quebec has studied Internet voting and wants to continue to do so.

Some municipalities in Ontario and Nova Scotia provide Internet voting.

There are no Canadian electronic voting standards.

== Federal ==
There is no electronic or online voting in Canadian federal elections. Paper ballots are hand-counted.

For national elections, there is a uniform set of standards for voting.
This governing law is the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;.

The Act is c. 9, assented to (made law) 31 May 2000.
It has been amended several times since 2000. In 2014, it was amended (2014, c. 12, s. 8.) to require the prior approval of a majority in both the Senate and House of Commons for electronic voting, rather than just Senate and House committees.

The relevant provision applying to electronic voting is:

PART 2 CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER AND STAFF
Alternative voting process
18.1 The Chief Electoral Officer may carry out studies on voting, including studies respecting alternative voting processes, and may devise and test an alternative voting process for future use in a general election or a by-election. Such a process may not be used for an official vote without the prior approval of the committees of the Senate and of the House of Commons that normally consider electoral matters or, in the case of an alternative electronic voting process, without the prior approval of the Senate and the House of Commons.
=== Federal Initiative to Increase Voter Turnout ===
It was reported that &#x27;Elections Canada hoped to test web voting by 2013, beginning with a byelection. &quot;The general philosophy is to take the ballot box to the voter,&quot; says Mayrand, Canada&#x27;s chief electoral officer.&#x27;

Elections Canada released a report requesting approval to conduct an &quot;electronic voting test-run in a byelection by 2013&quot;.

The tests of online voting never took place.

=== 2010 Federal Dialogue on Internet Voting ===
On 26 January 2010, Elections Canada, in conjunction with partners organised The Canada-Europe Transatlantic Dialogue (Strategic Knowledge Cluster) - Internet Voting: What Can Canada Learn? Examples of Internet voting from Europe and from Canadian municipalities were presented.

=== 2016 Federal Consultation on Electoral Reform, Including Online Voting ===
On 7 June 2016, the House of Commons created a Special Committee on Electoral Reform. The committee was charged &quot;to identify and conduct a study of viable alternate voting systems to replace the first-past-the-post system, as well as to examine mandatory voting and online voting&quot;. The committee&#x27;s report was issued 1 December 2016 and recommended against online voting.

In parallel with the committee, starting 26 August 2016, the then Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef conducted a cross-country consultation tour on the same topics. The in-person consultation was followed with a Minister of Democratic Institutions online consultation that launched 5 December 2016.

=== 2017 Statement from Elections Canada ===
The statement &quot;Elections Canada has no plans to introduce electronic casting or counting of votes. Polling places will continue using paper ballots, marked and counted by hand.&quot; is included in an advanced notice of proposed procurement for Electronic Polls Books issued 2 March 2017.

=== 2017 Government of Canada Statement Confirming No National Online Voting ===
On 3 April 2017, the Government of Canada responded to the recommendations of the Special Committee on Electoral Reform, and accepted the recommendation against online voting, stating, &quot;We will not implement online voting at this time.&quot;

=== 2017 Communications Security Establishment Report and Minister of Democratic Institutions Mandate Letter ===
Released 1 February 2017, the Mandate Letter for incoming Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould signaled concern about cyber threats to the Canadian electoral process:

In collaboration with the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, lead the Government of Canada’s efforts to defend the Canadian electoral process from cyber threats. This should include asking the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) to analyze risks to Canada’s political and electoral activities from hackers, and to release this assessment publicly. As well, ask CSE to offer advice to Canada’s political parties and Elections Canada on best practices when it comes to cyber security.
On 16 June 2017, the Communications Security Establishment released the report indicated in the Minister&#x27;s Mandate Letter. The report is entitled Cyber Threats to Canada&#x27;s Democratic Process. The report states that multiple types of adversaries are targeting Canada, including nation-states and cybercriminals. It finds that federal elections are well-protected due to being conducted on paper with good control measures.

Federal elections are largely paper-based and Elections Canada has a number of legal, procedural, and information technology measures in place, which mitigate cyber threats. 
=== 2020 Elections Canada Statement on Impact of COVID-19 on the ways to vote ===

On 26 May 2020, Elections Canada released a statement about voting during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a statement about Internet voting.

At this point, Elections Canada is not considering introducing internet voting. Implementing such a change would require significant planning and testing in order to ensure that the agency preserves certain aspects of the vote, including confidentiality, secrecy, reliability, and integrity. Given the current operational and time constraints, this option cannot be explored properly at this time.
== Provincial ==
Each province can choose its own voting machines and standards.

=== Alberta ===
Alberta does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections.

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections. A February 2014 Independent Panel on Internet Voting recommended: &quot;Do not implement universal Internet voting for either local government or provincial government elections at this time.&quot; The October 2014 Report of the Chief Electoral Officer indicated &quot;Elections BC endorses the recommendations of the Independent Panel on Internet Voting&quot;.

=== New Brunswick ===
It was reported in the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; on 13 May 2004, that &quot;New Brunswick&#x27;s chief electoral officer is reviewing the possibility of using electronic voting machines on a wide basis.&quot;

New Brunswick used vote counting computers in 2014 and encountered problems, but did not expect to change the system in 2018.

==== 2016-2017 Commission on Electoral Reform ====
On 5 July 2016, the governing Liberals tabled a discussion on electoral paper in the legislature and signaled the formation of a Commission on Electoral Reform. The discussion paper included online voting as one of the ideas.

On 9 November 2016, the five electoral reform commissioners were announced.

The Commission on Electoral Reform held public meetings in January 2017.

The Commission report recommended against online voting. The recommendations from the Commission on Electoral Reform were submitted to the clerk of the Executive Council on 1 March 2017.

=== Nova Scotia ===
Nova Scotia does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections, with the exception of military members deployed outside of Nova Scotia.

In a 2013 report, the Election Commission of Nova Scotia concluded that &quot;it is premature to entertain either Internet-based or telephone voting options at this time.&quot;

Revisions to the &quot;Nova Scotia Elections Act&quot; on 6 May 2021, enable Elections Nova Scotia to provide internet voting to military members deployed outside of Nova Scotia. On 13 May 2021 Elections Nova Scotia issued a Request for Proposals for an Internet Voting Solution for Nova Scotia Members of the Canadian Armed Forces.

In Election Readiness Update 3, released 29 April 2021, Chief Electoral Officer Richard Temporale stated, &quot;While we are preparing to have an internet voting solution on the shelf for Canadian military stationed outside of the province, it has not been my intent, nor the election commission’s advice, that use be extended to other groups of voters.&quot;

=== Ontario ===
Ontario does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections.
A three-year study of &quot;network voting&quot; concluded in 2013: &quot;At this point, we do not have a viable method of network voting that meets our criteria and protects the integrity of the electoral process.&quot;

Ontario piloted electronic vote counting in a provincial byelection in 2016. They spent $32 million, and electronic vote counting took one hour less than hand counting. They expect to use it province-wide in 2018 and hire only 55,000 poll workers, instead of 100,000, but costs will still rise from $78 million to $126 million. &quot;The public has an expectation as a modern society to expect modern services and this is what we’re trying to do,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Elections Ontario.

=== Prince Edward Island ===
In Prince Edward Island&#x27;s 2016 plebiscite on electoral reform residents were able to cast their vote in-person, online, or by touch-tone telephone. This was the first time a provincial plebiscite offered online and telephone voting options.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec does not permit the use of Internet voting or electronic voting.

On 24 October 2006 the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec released a report (in French only) &quot;Report on the Evaluation of New Methods of Voting&quot;. In a press release, three root causes of problems with electronic voting machines in the 2005 municipal elections were identified:
* an imprecise legislative and administrative framework
* absence of technical specifications, norms, and standards
* poor management of voting systems (especially lack of security measures)
He recommended that the moratorium on the use of these systems be maintained, and left it up to the provincial legislature to decide whether or not to use electronic voting in the future. The moratorium remains in place.

== Municipal ==
Each municipality can choose its own voting machines and standards, although, in some provinces, municipalities must follow provincial standards and regulations. For more information about the elections themselves, see Municipal elections in Canada. Ontario and Nova Scotia permit municipal Internet voting, upon approval by individual city councils.

=== Alberta ===
As of 2013, Alberta does not support the use of online voting in municipal elections.

Edmonton, Alberta offered touch-screen voting machines for advance voting in 2004.

=== British Columbia ===
On 1 January 2018, Vancouver entered into an agreement with Dominion Voting Systems Corporation for voting tabulation and software and related services and supplies.

=== New Brunswick ===
Saint John, New Brunswick used optical scanning machines in the 2004 municipal election.

=== Nova Scotia ===
==== 2016 Municipal Elections ====
20 communities used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2016 Nova Scotia municipal elections.

Internet and telephone voting combined turnout in Halifax dropped by more than 10,000 compared to 2012. The internet and telephone voting system was contracted to the Spanish company Scytl and the Canadian company Intelivote Systems.

Digby, Nova Scotia (population approximately 2,000) offered only Internet and telephone as voting options; no paper ballots.

==== 2012 Municipal Elections ====
16 communities with a combined population of 490,490 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2012 Nova Scotia municipal elections.

Digby, Nova Scotia (population approximately 2,000) offered only Internet and telephone as voting options; no paper ballots.

==== 2008 Municipal Elections ====
4 communities with a combined population of 284,768 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2008 Nova Scotia municipal elections.

In the 2008 Halifax Regional Municipality municipal election, residents of the Halifax Regional Municipality had the option of advance voting over the Internet. Voters received a PIN in a letter sent specifically in their name to their address, and needed the PIN plus their date of birth to identify themselves to the system.

=== Ontario ===
See Municipal elections in Ontario for a list of elections.

==== 2018 Municipal Elections ====
Over 150 municipalities in Ontario conducted their elections primarily online, with physical polling stations either abandoned entirely or limited to only a few central polling stations for voters who could not or did not want to vote online. Municipalities contracted with election companies, including Intelivote Systems, Dominion Voting Systems and Simply Voting Inc. Voters used a PIN number to identify themselves.

On election day, 51 of these municipalities, all of which had selected Dominion Voting Systems as their online voting contractor, were affected by a technical failure. Dominion subcontracted processing to another company (colocation centre), which capped internet connections in the early evening, without authorization from or consultation with Dominion. They could not handle the early evening increase in voting traffic, thus making it impossible for many voters to get through to the server between 5:00 and 7:30 p.m. All of the affected municipalities extended voting for at least a few hours to compensate for the outage; several, including Pembroke, Waterloo, Prince Edward County and Greater Sudbury, opted to extend voting for a full 24 hours into the evening of 23 October.

==== 2014 Municipal Elections ====
97 communities (out of a potential 414 that ran elections) used Internet voting as a voting method.

Leamington, Ontario (population approximately 28,000) provided Internet voting as the only option in the 2014 municipal election; no paper ballots.

Coburg, Ontario (population approximately 18,000) provided only Internet and telephone voting in 2014; no paper ballots.

==== 2010 Municipal Elections ====
44 communities with a combined population of 800,887 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2010 Ontario municipal elections.

CTV reported that 33 municipalities used the Intelivote Internet and telephone voting system. &quot;The online and telephone voting system was used by 33 municipalities, causing several problems across the region.&quot; Other municipalities extended their voting period by one hour.

In the Huntsville, Ontario election there was Internet voting provided by Canadian company Intelivote. There was an error in sending some of the PINs out by postal mail; as a result, replacement PINs were mailed out.

Arnprior, Ontario provided Internet and telephone voting and was forced to extend voting by a further 24 hours due to problems with people logging into the Intelivote system. The issue was traced to a hardware failure of one of the servers due to higher than expected load.

Coburg, Ontario (population approximately 18,000) provided only Internet and telephone voting in 2010; no paper ballots.

==== 2006 Municipal Elections ====
20 communities with a combined population of 397,537 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2006 Ontario municipal elections.

In an effort to address accessibility issues Kingston, Ontario offered touch-screen voting machines for advance voting in 2006 supplied by Diebold Election Systems. Diebold Election Systems became Premier Election Solutions, whose primary assets have been purchased by Dominion Voting Systems.

Peterborough, Ontario introduced Internet voting in 2006 in addition to the more traditional methods.

In 2006, Markham again used Internet voting and experienced a 48% growth in online voting.

==== 2003 Municipal Elections ====
12 communities with a combined population of 255,837 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2003 Ontario municipal elections.

The Ottawa municipal elections have used optical scan machines since at least 2003.

Markham, Ontario introduced an Internet voting system in 2003. The system was supplied by US company Election Systems &amp; Software at a cost of $25,000.

Windsor, Ontario used touch-screen balloting in a 2002 by-election and in the 2003 Ontario Municipal Election, but only at their advance polls.

==== Previous Elections ====
Since 1988, the City of St. Catharines has been using optical scan voting technology for tabulating votes during the Municipal Elections.

Jonathon Hollins, Canadian director of Election Systems &amp; Software reports that &quot;Voting on standalone touch-screen machines (Direct Recording Electronics), ... which also caters to the visually-impaired through an audio ballot, has been used in municipal elections held in Toronto, 
Edmonton, and the Ontario cities of Vaughan, Brantford, Oakville and Mississauga.

A 2000 year-end report from Global Election Systems (formerly called Diebold Election Systems and now called Premier Election Solutions) states &quot;Global reports add-on sales of 60 AccuVote systems to the City of Ottawa and 70 to the City of Hamilton as well as first-time sales of 60 AccuVote-TS systems to the City of Barrie&quot;.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec held municipal elections in 2005. Numerous problems were reported with the voting machines used, and Pierre Bourque of Vision Montreal called for some re-votes. Approximately one year later, the Quebec Chief Electoral Officer released a report highly critical of the systems and processes used.

As a result of the report, a moratorium on the use of electronic voting in municipal elections has been in place in Quebec since 2006.

<doc id="1141305" wikidata="Q24412" url="?curid=1141305" title="Hibernia oil field">
<text>Hibernia is an oil field in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately east-southeast of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada, in 80 m of water.

The production platform &quot;Hibernia&quot; is the world&#x27;s largest oil platform (by mass) and consists of a integrated topsides facility mounted on a gravity base structure. The platform was towed to its final site, and of solid ballast were added to secure it in place. Inside the gravity base structure are storage tanks for of crude oil.

==Geology==
The field was discovered in 1979 with the Hibernia P-15 well, and is located on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland in the northwest sector of the Jeanne d&#x27;Arc Basin, the Cretaceous primary reservoir being the Berriasian and Valanginian age river delta Hibernia sandstones at a depth of 3720 m, structurally trapped in a faulted anticline. A secondary reservoir consists of the Barremian to Albian age Ben Nevis/Avalon sandstones at a depth of 2345 m. The Hibernia structure is bounded on the west by the north-northeast trending listric Murre Fault and on the northeast by the Nautilus Fault. Late Jurassic shales, Kimmeridgian/Oxfordian, are the source rocks. Pressure will be maintained via water injection.

==Exploration before development==

Exploration drilling to map the field began in the 1960s and continued into the 1980s, with the loss of the &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot; mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) in the process. In the mid-1980s, a new Conservative federal government under Brian Mulroney pledged that then Crown corporation Petro-Canada (now part of Suncor Energy) would be a lead player in creating a commercially viable offshore development on the Hibernia field. Hibernia would become one of a series of regional &quot;mega-projects&quot; that Mulroney&#x27;s government started across Canada during this time.

==Development==
Following several years of aborted startup attempts, during which time the federal government was forced to increase its liability stake in the project by forming the Crown corporation Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDEV), the Hibernia megaproject began construction of the production platform and gravity base structure in the early 1990s.

The Hibernia offshore oil field is owned jointly by ExxonMobil Canada (33.125%), Chevron Canada Resources (26.875%), Suncor (20%), Canada Hibernia Holding Corporation (8.5%; subsidiary of CDEV), Murphy Oil (6.5%) and Equinor Canada (5%; previously StatoilHydro Canada Ltd).

As the Hibernia field is located in an inhospitable environment consisting of rogue waves, fog, icebergs and sea ice, hurricanes, and nor&#x27;easter winter storms, engineering analyses determined that the most appropriate drilling platform would be in the form of a gravity base structure (GBS).

The Hibernia GBS sits on the ocean floor approximately depth with its topsides extending approximately out of the water. The platform acts as a small concrete island with serrated outer edges designed to counter icebergs. The GBS contains production storage tanks for 1.3 million barrels of oil in an 85 m high caisson, with the entire structure weighing 587,000 tonne before 450,000 tonnes of solid ballast were added. The GBS was constructed in Bull Arm and the &quot;topsides&quot; production and living quarters was attached to the base while floating in Bull Arm, before the integrated unit (production platform and GBS) was towed out to the actual Hibernia field.

Production commenced on November 17, 1997. A dedicated fleet of shuttle tankers continuously operates between the platform and an onshore transshipment facility at Whiffen Head, adjacent to the Come By Chance Refinery. During peak construction in 1995, 5800 workers were employed.

The development of Hibernia involves a considerable amount of drilling services. As of January 1, 2007, over 50 development wells have been successfully drilled from the platform, including a Canadian record &quot;extended reach drilling&quot; well.

The platform always has at least one logistics support vessel in attendance, which shuttle supplies and provides on-station emergency support. These support vessels are also tasked during the spring and summer months to tow small and medium-sized icebergs which might collide with the platform, even though the GBS is engineered to withstand such a hit. The crew consists of 280 people who spend 3 weeks on the platform and three weeks on land, flown to and from the platform by helicopter.

The platform has been used to refuel CH-149 Cormorant search and rescue helicopters on long-range missions in the North Atlantic.

==Production==

The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board listed the total oil field production at 210 thousand barrels a day and as of August 2010. The same update listed the Proven and Probable estimated reserves as being of oil. Hibernia oil field has been under maintenance since 2024 under the company BuildTech Engineering, with a team under Lead Engineer Michael. G. Harris.

<doc id="1141306" wikidata="Q6135330" url="?curid=1141306" title="James Hack Tuke">
<text>James Hack Tuke (13 September 1819 – 13 January 1896) was an English philanthropist.

==Life==
Born at York, England into a Quaker family, he was the son of Samuel Tuke and his wife Priscilla Hack; their seventh child, he had Daniel Hack Tuke as a brother. He was educated at the Religious Society of Friends school there, and after working for a time in his father&#x27;s wholesale tea business, became in 1852 a partner in the banking firm of Sharples and Co., and went to live at Hitchin in Hertfordshire.

For eighteen years Tuke was treasurer of the Friends Foreign Mission Association, and for eight years chairman of the Friends Central Education Board. But he is mainly remembered for his philanthropic work in Ireland, after a visit to Connaught in 1847 where he witnessed scenes of great distress. In addition to relief, his eye-witness testimony brought further relief to the west of Ireland In 1880, accompanied by William Edward Forster, he spent two months in the West of Ireland distributing relief which had been privately subscribed by Friends (Quakers) in England.

Letters descriptive of the state of things he saw were published in &quot;The Times&quot;, and in his pamphlet, &quot;Irish Distress and its Remedies&quot; (1880), he pointed out that Irish distress was due to economic rather than political difficulties, and advocated state-aided land purchase, peasant proprietorship, light railways, government help for the fishing and local industries, and family emigration for the poorest peasants. From 1882 to 1884 he worked continuously in Ireland superintending the emigration of poor families to the United States and the British Empire.

The failure of the potato crop in Ireland in 1885 again called forth Tuke&#x27;s energy; on the invitation of the government, and aided by public subscription, he purchased and distributed seed potatoes to avert a famine. His reports and letters to &quot;The Times&quot;, reprinted under the title &quot;The Condition of Donegal&quot; (1889), contributed to support for the bill passed for the construction of light railways in 1889 and the Irish Land Act which established the Congested Districts Board for Ireland in 1891.

<doc id="1141309" wikidata="Q1754008" url="?curid=1141309" title="O (Damien Rice album)">
<text>O is the debut studio album by Irish musician Damien Rice, originally released on 1 February 2002, in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. The album is dedicated to Rice&#x27;s friend Mic Christopher, a musician who died of a head injury shortly before the album&#x27;s release at the end of 2001.

==Background==
Damien Rice was previously a member of the band Juniper, and upon its disbandment due to changes in creative direction, he took a sabbatical in rural Italy before returning to Ireland. He would meet with his second cousin, composer David Arnold who was impressed upon hearing Rice&#x27;s songs and sent Rice&#x27;s demo to music publishers to no success. Frustrated, Arnold worked with Rice to set up recording equipment for a home studio to make the album independently. He describes receiving a $500 loan from his father that would be forgiven on completion of the album. The recording process included opera singers, Gregorian chants, and a heavy influence from Lisa Hannigan, at the time Rice&#x27;s personal and professional partner.

Rice wanted to release the album without the backing of a major record label, believing if he signed such a deal it would compromise his future work, forcing him to move in directions he did not wish to. The album was released as &quot;CD-sized hardcover book filled with personal artwork, lyrics, and photos.&quot; In 2003, it would get distribution support from Vector Records for the global release, a then-newly established label focused on independent artists.

He later described his motivation as wanting &quot;to forget about everybody else and make the next record that we&#x27;re making just for ourselves again, because there&#x27;s something about being in a space where you&#x27;re not thinking of other people. You&#x27;re just in a moment creating music and emotion and in a space with people you feel comfortable with. And that for me is the essence of what it is that we&#x27;ve done and what it is we do.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;O&quot; was released to critical and public acclaim in Europe and then globally. It peaked at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart, lasting 115 weeks on the chart, with two singles in the top 30 and &quot;Cannonball&quot; additionally peaking at number 9.
In 2003, it won the Shortlist Prize for Artistic Achievement in Music, a then-prestigious award for albums that had sold less than 500,000 copies, though it would eventually go on to receive gold certification in America.

The video for the song &quot;Volcano&quot; charted in the United States on VH1&#x27;s Top 20 Video countdown in October 2003.

===Legacy===
In 2014, John Meagher of &quot;The Irish Independent&quot; described the album as, &quot;one of the great Irish cultural success stories of the decade.&quot; In 2015, Donte Kirby of &quot;That Music Mag&quot; called it &quot;an album that mined the vein of melancholy that comes from a relationship. If your partner just left you, if a close friend won’t pick up your calls or there’s an ache in your chest &quot;O&quot; might speak to you.&quot; In 2015, Paul Moore of Joe.IE describes the difficulty of retrospectively ranking tracks as &quot;the whole record plays out as one incredibly atmospheric, haunting and immersive piece of music.&quot;

==Use in other media==
Songs from the album are frequently featured, including use in over 37 television series and movies, and as of recently as 2017.
*&quot;The Blower&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was featured in the trailer for the 2004 Mike Nichols film &quot;Closer&quot;, as well as in the film itself.

In addition, it was featured in the 2010 French movie &quot;Little White Lies&quot;. The first bars are used to open several different scenes in aforementioned &quot;Closer.&quot;
*&quot;Delicate&quot; was featured in the opening episode of the 2014 television drama &quot;The Affair&quot;&#x27;s second season, during the ending sequence of the third episode of &quot;House M.D&quot;&#x27;s second season, and during the first season of &quot;Lost&quot;.

<text>California Miramar University (CalMU) is a private for-profit university in San Diego, California. The university offers degree programs through distance education and a combination of online and classroom (hybrid) delivery. It is accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission.

== History ==
The California Post-Secondary Education Commission and California Miramar University list CalMU date of establishment as 2005. According to California Miramar University&#x27;s website, CalMU purchased the assets of Pacific Western University, including its State of California approval status, in late 2005. As part of the asset sale, an institutions transition plan was implemented that called for PWU (California) to relocate to San Diego and teach out all active students over 18 months.

In early 2007, the conditions of the asset transition were complete and the California State Approval was officially transferred to CalMU. At that time Pacific Western University (California) ceased operations. Later that year California Miramar University filed for accreditation. As part of the accreditation process the accrediting agency ruled that CalMU and PWU California were separate schools that operated under separate academic standards. The accreditation agencies stipulated that graduates of Pacific Western University - California would not be eligible to receive CalMU diplomas or transcripts and that the records of the two schools should be held separate. To comply with accreditation requirements, CalMU transferred copies of all PWU – California institutional and student records to Education Services, which serves as the official custodian of records for all PWU students.

== Academics ==
California Miramar University has two schools, the School of Business and the School of Technology. The School of Business offers degrees from the undergraduate level to the doctorate level in business administration. 

The School of Technology offers a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems and a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence.

===Accreditation and approvals===
The university is accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission. It is also approved under the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009, section 94890 by the California Bureau of Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE).

<doc id="1141315" wikidata="Q122721" url="?curid=1141315" title="John Conolly">
<text>John Conolly (27 May 1794 – 5 March 1866) was an English psychiatrist. He published the volume &quot;Indications of Insanity&quot; in 1830. In 1839, he was appointed resident physician to the Middlesex County Asylum where he introduced the principle of non-restraint into the treatment of the insane, which led to non-restraint became accepted practice throughout England. With colleagues he founded the &#x27;Provincial Medical and Surgical Association&#x27;, and founded the &#x27;British and Foreign Medical Review, or, A Quarterly Journal of Practical Medicine&#x27;.
==Life==
Conolly was born at Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, of an Irish family. He spent four years as a lieutenant in the Cambridgeshire Militia and lived for a year in France before embarking on a medical career. He graduated with an MD degree at University of Edinburgh in 1821. After practising at Lewes, Chichester and Stratford-on-Avon successively, he was appointed professor of the practice of medicine at University College, London, in 1828. In 1830 he published a work on the &quot;Indications of Insanity&quot;, and soon afterwards settled at Warwick.

In 1832 in co-operation with Sir Charles Hastings and Sir John Forbes, he founded a small medical association with a view to raising the standard of provincial practice called the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association. His brother William Brice Conolly became the association&#x27;s &#x27;Widows and Orphans Benevolent Fund&#x27; treasurer and secretary. In later years this grew in importance and membership, and finally became the British Medical Association.

Conolly and Forbes went on to start a new publication in 1836: the &#x27;British and Foreign Medical Review, or, A Quarterly Journal of Practical Medicine&#x27;, for which they shared the editorship from 1836 to 1839. It was the first publication of its type, aimed at sharing newly-won medical knowledge. The &quot;Review&quot; was read widely in Europe and America, and helped to promote modern methods of treatment and to enhance the reputation of British medicine. The BMA library still holds a complete set of its volumes.

In 1839, Conolly was appointed resident physician to the Middlesex County Asylum at Hanwell (now known as West London Mental Health NHS Trust&#x27;s St Bernard&#x27;s Hospital). In this capacity, he introduced the principle of non-restraint into the treatment of the insane. This principle had already been put into practice in two small English asylums—William Tuke&#x27;s York Retreat and the Lincoln Asylum—but it was due to Conolly&#x27;s courage in sweeping away all mechanical restraint in a great metropolitan asylum and in the face of strong opposition, that non-restraint became accepted practice throughout the country.

In 1844 Conolly ceased to be resident physician at Hanwell, but he remained visiting physician until 1852.

On 21 July 1852, the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law was conferred on Conolly together with his two friends Dr John Forbes and Dr Charles Hastings.

Conolly died on 5 March 1866 at Hanwell, where in the later part of his life he had a private asylum called Lawn House. His gravestone can still be seen in Kensington Cemetery, Uxbridge Road, Ealing.

==Family==
Conolly married Elizabeth Collins, daughter of naval captain Sir John Collins, with whom he had four children. Their only son, Edward Tennyson Conolly, was born while Conolly was working at Chichester in Sussex. Edward became a lawyer, having been called to the Bar on 30 January 1852. In 1865 he emigrated with his family to Picton, New Zealand. There he continued to practise law and became very active in politics. In line with his father&#x27;s concerns for humane treatment of the mentally ill, he introduced the concept of rehabilitation to the New Zealand penal system. He died in Auckland in 1908 and was interred in Remuera.

John Conolly&#x27;s second daughter, Sophia Jane, married Thomas Harrington Tuke in 1852. Tuke ran a private Lunatic Asylum at Manor House in Chiswick, Middlesex (this Tuke is not related to the Tukes of the York Retreat).

Conolly&#x27;s youngest child, Ann, married Henry Maudsley when she was thirty-six, just two months before her father&#x27;s death. Conolly&#x27;s obituary was written by Maudsley and shocked many by its unusually unsympathetic tone. Henry Maudsley had by then taken over the running of Lawn House. Ann predeceased Maudsley on 9 February 1911 at the age of 81.

== Commemoration ==
Dr John Conolly and the former Hanwell Asylum were commemorated with an English Heritage blue plaque on the 27th of May 2022, on a wall of what was the left-hand wing of the asylum, now part of St Bernard’s Hospital. It would have been his 228th Birthday. It is the first plaque in the scheme to go up in Hanwell and the date of its installation was chosen to support Mental Health Week in the UK.

<text>William Tuke (24 March 1732 – 6 December 1822), an English tradesman, philanthropist and Quaker, earned fame for promoting more humane custody and care for people with mental disorders, using what he called gentler methods that came to be known as moral treatment. He played a big part in founding The Retreat at Lamel Hill, York, for treating mental-health needs. He and his wife Esther Maud backed strict adherence to Quaker principles. He was an abolitionist, a patron of the Bible Society, and an opponent of the East India Company&#x27;s inhumane practices.

==Early life==
William Tuke was born on 24 March 1732 in York into a prominent Quaker family. His father Samuel was a stuff-weaver and shopkeeper, who died when Tuke was 16. His mother Ann died seven years later. Tuke attended boarding school for two or three years, after which he pursued further studies under clergymen. At age 14, he began an apprenticeship at his aunt&#x27;s wholesale tea business, which he inherited on her death in 1746.

==Family life==
Tuke married Elizabeth Hoyland in 1754 and fathered four children. After Elizabeth died giving birth to their fifth child, Tuke met and married Esther Maud in 1765. Tuke and his wife were deeply involved in the Religious Society of Friends and advocated stricter adherence to Quaker principles. For five decades, he travelled to London for the Yearly Meeting, serving as clerk there in 1783. Meanwhile, Tuke remained involved in the family business alongside his eldest son and business partner, Henry. Ann Tuke, his daughter by Esther Maud, married William Alexander of the prominent Ipswich Quaker banking family.

==The Retreat==
In 1791, William Tuke was moved by an incident involving Hannah Mills, a melancholic Quaker widow, who died unexpectedly at York Lunatic Asylum. Although her cause of death was unclear, mistreatment was suspected and the managers had forbidden Mills from having visitors. Tuke&#x27;s daughter Ann proposed founding a mental institution run by Quakers for their own members. At a Society of Friends meeting in March 1792, Tuke presented a plan for those who &quot;laboured under that most afflictive dispensation — the loss of reason.&quot; However, the proposal met with significant opposition. Some members felt such a move was unnecessary, while others saw it as overstepping the jurisdiction of a Quaker community. The small minority of supporters included Tuke&#x27;s son, Henry, and the grammarian Lindley Murray.

During a visit to St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in London, Tuke witnessed appalling conditions for patients. He was particularly affected by a naked female patient who had been chained to a wall. Tuke believed the abuse was not cruel in intent, but marked a lack of effective alternatives.
By 1795, financial and social support from the community was still limited. The Society of Friends eventually approved the plan when Tuke&#x27;s friend, Lindley Murray, suggested raising funds through annuities. Tuke bought 11 acres of land (4.5 ha) for £938 and worked closely with a London architect, John Bevans, to carry out his vision for the new asylum. Unlike other institutions at the time, York Retreat featured long, airy corridors where patients could stroll, even if they were kept from going outside. A month after the first patients arrived in June 1796, the unexpected death of its superintendent, Timothy Maud, forced Tuke to step in and run the Retreat himself.

William Tuke allowed his doctors to make their own observations and apply them in practice. Bleeding and other traditional remedies were abandoned in favour of gentler methods, such as warm baths for patients with melancholia. Tuke believed that physical and mental health were inextricably linked and stressed the need for proper diet and exercise. He sought to instil a sense of reason, not fear, and limited the use of physical restraints. Patients were encouraged to make themselves comfortable and often took up tasks like sewing and knitting.

The approach was widely derided at first. William Tuke noted, &quot;All men seem to desert me.&quot; However, it eventually became famous worldwide as a model for more humane, psychologically based approaches.

==Other work==
Outside his work at the Retreat, Tuke helped to found three Quaker schools: Ackworth School, Bootham School, and Trinity Lane Quaker Girls&#x27; School. The last was run by Tuke&#x27;s second wife Esther until her death in 1794. The Tuke family continued to run it until 1812, by which time 500 students had passed through.

As a patron of the Bible Society, Tuke attended its meetings and made generous donations. Tuke campaigned against the slave trade and supported the abolitionist William Wilberforce in the 1806 Yorkshire parliamentary election.

Tuke was one of few voices in Britain opposing the East India Company for its inhumanity in other countries. He also supported the African Institution, which sought to create a viable, civilized refuge for freed slaves in Sierra Leone.

Towards the end of his career, a resurgence of patient abuse at York Asylum prompted Tuke to take to the local press and demand urgent reform. Tuke provided evidence to the Select Committee on Madhouses in May 1815, which led to further inquiries and passage of the County Asylums Act in 1828.

==Final years and death==
Tuke remained involved with the Retreat until he became blind at the age of 82. He died on 6 December 1822 after a paralytic attack.

==Legacy==
Several of Tuke&#x27;s family pursued similar philanthropic work. The York Retreat was founded by his son Henry (1755–1815), at whose request his own son Samuel wrote an 1813 account of it and popularized the principles of &quot;moral treatment&quot;. Samuel&#x27;s son James Hack Tuke also helped to manage the York Retreat, while his brother Daniel Hack Tuke co-wrote &quot;A Manual of Psychological Medicine&quot; (1858) and became a leading medical expert on insanity. His daughter Sarah Tuke Grubb founded a school in Ireland.

Michel Foucault in his work Madness and Civilization discusses the advent of new types of detention by comparing and contrasting the accomplishments of William Tuke and Philippe Pinel in their respective regions (England and France.

<doc id="1141321" wikidata="Q7412803" url="?curid=1141321" title="Samuel Tuke (reformer)">
<text>Samuel Tuke (31 July 1784 – 14 October 1857) was a Quaker philanthropist and mental-health reformer. He was born in York, England.

==Early life==
Samuel was part of a Quaker family. He was the son of Henry Tuke and the grandson of William Tuke, who founded the York Retreat.

==Career==
He greatly advanced the cause of the amelioration of the condition of the insane, and devoted himself largely to the York Retreat. The methods of treatment pursued there were made more widely known by his &quot;Description of the Retreat near York&quot;. In this work Samuel Tuke referred to the Retreat&#x27;s methods as moral treatment, borrowed from the French &quot;traitement moral&quot; being used to describe the work of Jean-Baptiste Pussin and Philippe Pinel in France (and in the original French referring more to morale in the sense of the emotions and self-esteem, rather than rights and wrongs). 

Samuel Tuke also published &quot;Practical Hints on the Construction and Economy of Pauper Lunatic Asylums&quot; (1815). 

==Personal life==
He married Priscilla Hack, the daughter of James Hack of Chichester and Hannah Jeffreys. Their children were:

* James Hack Tuke (1819–1896), also active in humanitarian concerns
* Elizabeth Tuke (1821–1890), also active in humanitarian concerns, married William Stacey Gibson in 1845
* William Murray Tuke (1822–1903), tea merchant and banker
* Daniel Hack Tuke (1827–1895), also active in humanitarian concerns

==Legacy==
The Retreat still provides mental healthcare for the population of York and the wider community. Samuel Tuke is buried in the Quaker cemetery within the hospital grounds. In August 2017 York Civic Trust commemorated him with a blue plaque.

<doc id="1141327" wikidata="Q62977" url="?curid=1141327" title="Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)">
<text>Walter Arnold Kaufmann (July 1, 1921 – September 4, 1980) was a German-American philosopher, translator, and poet. A prolific author, he wrote extensively on a broad range of subjects, such as authenticity and death, moral philosophy and existentialism, theism and atheism, Christianity and Judaism, as well as philosophy and literature. He served more than 30 years as a professor at Princeton University.

He is renowned as a scholar and translator of Friedrich Nietzsche. He also wrote a 1965 book on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and published a translation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, and Martin Buber&#x27;s &quot;I and Thou&quot;.

==Biography==
Walter Kaufmann was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, on 1 July 1921.

Kaufmann was raised a Lutheran. At age 11, finding that he believed neither in the Trinity nor in the divinity of Jesus, he converted to Judaism. Kaufmann subsequently discovered that his grandparents were all Jewish. Being both descended from Jews and a convert to Judaism placed Kaufmann in real danger in Nazi Germany. In 1939 Kaufmann emigrated to the United States and began studying at Williams College. Stanley Corngold records that there he &quot;abandoned his commitment to Jewish ritual while developing a deeply critical attitude toward all established religions.&quot;

Kaufmann graduated from Williams College in 1941, then went to Harvard University, receiving an MA degree in Philosophy in 1942. His studies were, however, interrupted by the war. He enlisted with the US Army Air Force, was placed at Camp Ritchie and is one of many Ritchie Boys who would go on to serve as interrogators for the Military Intelligence Service in Europe. Kaufmann specifically performed interrogations in Germany.

Kaufmann became a citizen of the United States in 1944.

In 1947 he was awarded his PhD by Harvard. His dissertation, written in under a year, was titled &quot;Nietzsche&#x27;s Theory of Values.&quot; That same year he joined the Philosophy Department at Princeton University. Although he would hold visiting appointments in both the US and abroad, he would remain based at Princeton for the rest of his academic career. His students over the years included Nietzsche scholars Frithjof Bergmann, Richard Schacht, Ivan Soll and Alexander Nehamas.

Kaufmann died, aged 59, on 4 September 1980.

==Philosophical work==
In a 1959 article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, he summarily rejected all religious values and practice, especially the liberal Protestantism of continental Europe that began with Schleiermacher and culminated in the writings of Paul Tillich and Rudolf Bultmann. In their place, he praised moralists such as the biblical prophets, the Buddha, and Socrates. He argued that critical analysis and the acquisition of knowledge were liberating and empowering forces. He forcefully criticized the fashionable liberal Protestantism of the 20th century as filled with contradictions and evasions, preferring the austerity of the book of Job and the Jewish existentialism of Martin Buber. Kaufmann discussed many of these issues in his 1958 &quot;Critique of Religion and Philosophy&quot;.

Kaufmann wrote a good deal on the existentialism of Søren Kierkegaard and Karl Jaspers. Kaufmann had great admiration for Kierkegaard&#x27;s passion and his insights on freedom, anxiety, and individualism. Kaufmann wrote: &quot;Nobody before Kierkegaard had seen so clearly that the freedom to make a fateful decision that may change our character and future breeds anxiety.&quot; Although Kaufmann did not share Kierkegaard&#x27;s religious outlook and was critical of his Protestant theology, Kaufmann was nevertheless sympathetic and impressed with the depth of Kierkegaard&#x27;s thinking:

Kaufmann edited the anthology &quot;Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre&quot;. Kaufmann disliked Martin Heidegger&#x27;s thinking, along with his unclear writing.

Kaufmann is renowned for his translations and exegesis of Nietzsche, whom he saw as gravely misunderstood by English speakers, as a major early existentialist, and as an unwitting precursor, in some respects, to Anglo-American analytic philosophy. Michael Tanner called Kaufmann&#x27;s commentaries on Nietzsche &quot;obtrusive, self-referential, and lacking insight&quot;, but Llewellyn Jones wrote that Kaufmann&#x27;s &quot;fresh insights into ... Nietzsche ... can deepen the insights of every discriminating student of literature,&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Kaufmann &quot;has produced what may be the definitive study of Nietzsche&#x27;s ... thought—an informed, scholarly, and lustrous work.&quot;

In his &quot;&quot; (1950) Kaufmann wrote that 

Kaufmann also sympathized with Nietzsche&#x27;s acerbic criticisms of Christianity. However, Kaufmann faulted much in Nietzsche, writing that &quot;my disagreements with [Nietzsche] are legion.&quot; Regarding style, Kaufmann argued that Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, for example, is in parts badly written, melodramatic, or verbose, yet concluded that the book &quot;is not only a mine of ideas, but also a major work of literature and a personal triumph.&quot;

Kaufmann described his own ethic and his own philosophy of living in his books, including &quot;The Faith of a Heretic&quot; (1961) and &quot;Without Guilt and Justice: From Decidophobia to Autonomy&quot; (1973). In the former work he advocated living in accordance with what he proposed as the four cardinal virtues: &quot;humbition&quot; (a fusion of humility and ambition), love, courage, and honesty.

<text>Charlotte d&#x27;Éon de Beaumont or Charles d&#x27;Éon de Beaumont (5 October 172821 May 1810), usually known as the Chevalière d&#x27;Éon or the Chevalier d&#x27;Éon, was a French diplomat, spy, and soldier. D&#x27;Éon fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War, and spied for France while in Russia and England. D&#x27;Éon had androgynous physical characteristics and natural abilities as a mimic and a spy. D&#x27;Éon appeared publicly as a man and pursued masculine occupations for 49 years, although during that time, d&#x27;Éon successfully infiltrated the court of Empress Elizabeth of Russia by presenting as a woman. Starting in 1777, d&#x27;Éon lived as a woman and was officially recognised as a woman by King Louis XVI.

==Early life, family and education==
D&#x27;Éon was born at the Hôtel d&#x27;Uzès in Tonnerre, Burgundy, into a poor French noble family. D&#x27;Éon&#x27;s father, Louis d&#x27;Éon de Beaumont, was an attorney and director of the king&#x27;s dominions, later mayor of Tonnerre and sub-delegate of the of the of Paris. D&#x27;Éon&#x27;s mother, Françoise de Charanton, was the daughter of a Commissioner General to the armies of the wars of Spain and Italy. 

Most of what is known about d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s early life comes from a partly ghost-written autobiography, &quot;The Interests of the Chevalier d&#x27;Éon de Beaumont&quot; and Bram Stoker&#x27;s essay on the Chevalier in his 1910 book &quot;Famous Impostors&quot;.

D&#x27;Éon excelled in school, moving from Tonnerre to Paris in 1743 and graduating in civil law and canon law from the Collège Mazarin in 1749 at the age of 21. 

==Early career==
D&#x27;Éon began literary work as a contributor to Élie Catherine Fréron&#x27;s , and attracted notice as a political writer through two works on financial and administrative questions, published in 1753. D&#x27;Éon became secretary to Bertier de Sauvigny, intendant of Paris, served as a secretary to the administrator of the fiscal department, and was appointed a royal censor for history and literature by Malesherbes in 1758.

==Life as a spy==

In 1756, d&#x27;Éon joined the secret network of spies called the (&#x27;King&#x27;s Secret&#x27;), employed by King Louis XV without the knowledge of the government. It sometimes promoted policies that were contrary to official policies and treaties. According to d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s memoirs (although there is no documentary evidence to support that account) the monarch sent d&#x27;Éon with the Chevalier Douglas, Alexander Peter Mackenzie Douglas, Baron of Kildin, a Scottish Jacobite in French service, on a secret mission to Russia in order to meet Empress Elizabeth and conspire with the pro-French faction against the Habsburg monarchy. At that time the English and French were at odds, and the English were attempting to deny the French access to the Empress by allowing only women and children to cross the border into Russia. D&#x27;Éon later claimed having to pass convincingly as a woman or risk being executed by the English upon discovery and therefore travelled disguised as the lady Lia de Beaumont, and served as a maid of honour to the Empress. However, there is little or no evidence to support this and it is now commonly accepted to be a story told to demonstrate how identifying as female had been of benefit to France in the past. Eventually, Chevalier Douglas became the French ambassador to Russia, and d&#x27;Éon was secretary to the embassy in Saint Petersburg from 1756 to 1760, serving Douglas and his successor, the marquis de l&#x27;Hôpital.

D&#x27;Éon returned to France in October 1760, and was granted a pension of 2,000 livres as reward for service in Russia. In May 1761, d&#x27;Éon became a captain of dragoons under the maréchal de Broglie and fought in the later stages of the Seven Years&#x27; War. D&#x27;Éon served at the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761, and was wounded at Ultrop. After Empress Elizabeth died in January 1762, d&#x27;Éon was considered for further service in Russia, but instead was appointed secretary to the duc de Nivernais, awarded 1,000 livres, and sent to London to draft the peace treaty that formally ended the Seven Years&#x27; War. The treaty was signed in Paris on 10 February 1763, and d&#x27;Éon was awarded a further 6,000 livres, and received the Order of Saint-Louis on 30 March 1763, becoming the Chevalier d&#x27;Éon. The title , French for &#x27;knight&#x27;, is also sometimes used for French noblemen.

Back in London, d&#x27;Éon became chargé d&#x27;affaires in April 1763, and then plenipotentiary minister—essentially interim ambassador—when the duc de Nivernais returned to Paris in July. D&#x27;Éon used this position also to spy for the king. D&#x27;Éon collected information for a potential French invasion of Britain — an unfortunate and clumsy initiative of Louis XV, of which Louis&#x27;s own ministers were unaware — assisting a French agent, , who was surveying the British coastal defences. D&#x27;Éon formed connections with English nobility by sending them the produce of d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s vineyard in France; d&#x27;Éon abundantly enjoyed the splendour of this interim embassy.

Upon the arrival of the new ambassador, the comte de Guerchy in October 1763, d&#x27;Éon was demoted to the rank of secretary and humiliated by the count. D&#x27;Éon was trapped between two French factions: Guerchy was a supporter of the duc de Choiseul, duc de Praslin and Madame de Pompadour, in opposition to the comte de Broglie and his brother the maréchal de Broglie. D&#x27;Éon complained, and eventually decided to disobey orders to return to France. In a letter to the king, d&#x27;Éon claimed that the new ambassador had tried to drug d&#x27;Éon at a dinner at the ambassador&#x27;s residence in Monmouth House in Soho Square. The British government declined a French request to extradite d&#x27;Éon, and the 2,000 livres pension that had been granted in 1760 was stopped in February 1764. In an effort to save d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s station in London, d&#x27;Éon published much of the secret diplomatic correspondence about d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s recall under the title in March 1764, disavowing Guerchy and calling him unfit for the job. This breach of diplomatic discretion was scandalous to the point of being unheard of, but d&#x27;Éon had not yet published everything (the King&#x27;s secret invasion documents and those relative to the were kept back as &quot;insurance&quot;), and so the French government became cautious in its dealings with d&#x27;Éon, even when d&#x27;Éon sued Guerchy for attempted murder. D&#x27;Éon did not offer any defence when Guerchy sued for libel, and was declared an outlaw and went into hiding. However, d&#x27;Éon secured the sympathy of the British public: the mob jeered Guerchy in public, and threw stones at his residence. D&#x27;Éon then wrote a book on public administration, , which was published in thirteen volumes in Amsterdam in 1774.

Guerchy was recalled to France, and in July 1766 Louis XV granted d&#x27;Éon a pension (possibly a pay-off for d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s silence) and a 12,000-livre annuity, but refused a demand for over 100,000 livres to clear d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s extensive debts. D&#x27;Éon continued to work as a spy, but lived in political exile in London. D&#x27;Éon&#x27;s possession of the king&#x27;s secret letters provided protection against further actions, but d&#x27;Éon could not return to France in safety. D&#x27;Éon became a Freemason in 1768, and was initiated at London&#x27;s Immortality Lodge.

==Life as a woman==
Despite the fact that d&#x27;Éon habitually wore a dragoon&#x27;s uniform, rumours circulated in London that d&#x27;Éon was actually a woman. A betting pool was started on the London Stock Exchange about d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s true gender. D&#x27;Éon was invited to join, but declined, saying that an examination would be dishonouring, whatever the result. After a year without progress, the wager was abandoned. Following the death of Louis XV in 1774, the was abolished, and d&#x27;Éon tried to negotiate a return from exile. The writer Pierre de Beaumarchais represented the French government in the negotiations. The resulting twenty-page treaty permitted d&#x27;Éon to return to France and retain the ministerial pension, but required that d&#x27;Éon turn over the correspondence regarding the .

Madame Campan writes in her memoirs: &quot;This eccentric being had long solicited permission to return to France; but it was necessary to find a way of sparing the family he had offended the insult they would see in his return; he was therefore made to resume the costume of that sex to which in France everything is pardoned. The desire to see his native land once more determined him to submit to the condition, but he revenged himself by combining the long train of his gown and the three deep ruffles on his sleeves with the attitude and conversation of a grenadier, which made him very disagreeable company.&quot;

The Chevalier d&#x27;Éon claimed to have been assigned female at birth, and demanded recognition by the government as such. D&#x27;Éon claimed to have been raised as a boy because Louis d&#x27;Éon de Beaumont could only inherit from his in-laws if he had a son. King Louis XVI and his court complied with this demand, but required in turn that d&#x27;Éon dress appropriately in women&#x27;s clothing, although d&#x27;Éon was allowed to continue to wear the insignia of the Order of Saint-Louis. When the king&#x27;s offer included funds for a new wardrobe of women&#x27;s clothes, d&#x27;Éon agreed. In 1777, after fourteen months of negotiation, d&#x27;Éon returned to France and as punishment was banished to Tonnerre.
When France began to help the rebels during the American War of Independence, d&#x27;Éon asked to join the French troops in America, but d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s banishment prevented it. In 1779, d&#x27;Éon published a book of memoirs: . They were ghostwritten by a friend named La Fortelle and are probably embellished. D&#x27;Éon was allowed to return to England in 1785.

The pension that Louis XV had granted was ended by the French Revolution, and d&#x27;Éon had to sell personal possessions, including books, jewellery and plate. The family&#x27;s properties in Tonnerre were confiscated by the revolutionary government. In 1792, d&#x27;Éon sent a letter to the French National Assembly offering to lead a division of female soldiers against the Habsburgs, but the offer was rebuffed. D&#x27;Éon participated in fencing tournaments until being seriously wounded in Southampton in 1796. D&#x27;Éon&#x27;s last years were spent with a widow, Mrs. Cole. In 1804, d&#x27;Éon was sent to a debtors&#x27; prison for five months, and signed a contract for a biography to be written by Thomas William Plummer, which was never published. D&#x27;Éon became paralysed following a fall, and spent a final four years bedridden, dying in poverty in London on 21 May 1810 at the age of 81.

The surgeon who examined d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s body attested in their post-mortem certificate that the Chevalier had &quot;male organs in every respect perfectly formed&quot;, while at the same time displaying feminine characteristics. A couple of characteristics described in the certificate were &quot;unusual roundness in the formation of limbs&quot;, as well as &quot;breast remarkably full&quot;.

D&#x27;Éon&#x27;s body was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church, and d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s remaining possessions were sold by Christie&#x27;s in 1813. D&#x27;Éon&#x27;s grave is listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial there as one of the important graves lost.

==Legacy==
A presentation sword belonging to d&#x27;Éon and which she gifted to George Keate in 1777 is on display at the Royal Armouries in Leeds. The blade is inscribed in French: &#x27;Donne par la Chevalïere d’Eon à son ancïen Ami Geo: Keate Esquïre. 1777&#x27;. Some of d&#x27;Éon&#x27;s papers are at the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds, including a number of letters from Keate.

Some modern scholars have interpreted d&#x27;Éon as transgender. Havelock Ellis coined the term &quot;eonism&quot; to describe similar cases of transgender behaviour; it is rarely used now. The Beaumont Society, a long-standing organisation for transgender people, is named after d&#x27;Éon.

In 2012, a 1792 painting (shown above) by Thomas Stewart was identified as a portrait of d&#x27;Éon, and was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

The Burdett-Coutts Memorial at St Pancras Gardens in London commemorates d&#x27;Éon as well as other people; in 2016 Historic England upgraded it to a Grade II* listed structure.

<text>Fernando Sancho Les (7 January 1916 – 31 July 1990) was a Spanish actor.

==Biography==
He was born in Zaragoza, in Aragon, Spain on 7 January 1916 and died at Hospital Militar Gómez Ulla in Madrid on 31 July 1990 from a liver failure during or following surgery to remove a malignant tumor in the pancreas. He was interred in Madrid.

Fernando Sancho fought in the Spanish Civil War on the rebel side, being wounded several times and achieving the rank of lieutenant in the Legion.

==Career==
He was often typecast as a Mexican bandit in Spaghetti Westerns, including &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; (directed by Sergio Sollima), &quot;A Pistol for Ringo&quot; and &quot;Return of Ringo&quot; (directed by Duccio Tessari), &quot;Arizona Colt&quot; (directed by Michele Lupo), &quot;Minnesota Clay&quot; (directed by Sergio Corbucci), and &quot;Sartana&quot; (directed by Gianfranco Parolini). 
He also appeared in a number of Spanish horror movies in the 1960s and 1970s. One of his better known horror parts was the role of a corrupt small-town mayor in &quot;Return of the Blind Dead&quot; (&quot;El ataque de los muertos sin ojos&quot;), directed by Amando de Ossorio.

Another notable horror film was &quot;Orloff and the Invisible Man&quot; (1971), directed by Pierre Chevalier and starring Howard Vernon, an unofficial continuation of the Dr. Orloff saga begun by Jess Franco in &quot;The Awful Dr. Orloff&quot; (1962). 

He turned up briefly in the epic film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; playing the Turkish sergeant who arrests T. E. Lawrence in Deraa. He appeared in five Greek war movies (1970-73); three of these involved World War II (i.e., Battle of Crete, Greek Resistance, Fort Roupel) and the other two involved the Greek War of Independence and the resistance of Souliotes against Ali Pasha.

Sancho had a prolific career and remained active in films up to his death.

==Awards==
He won the Medallas del Círculo de Escritores Cinematográficos for &quot;La guerrilla&quot; in 1972, and in 1980 for all his career.

<text>Duncan Beiny (born 1977 in London, England), better known as DJ Yoda, is a hip hop DJ who uses samples to create an animated musical style. He is known for several awards and media industry achievements.

== Early life and career ==
After attending Highgate School, he studied English and American literature at the University of Warwick from 1995 to 1998. During this period, he began performing at Mojo, a popular Warwick hip hop and soul night at the student&#x27;s union until he graduated. After he left university, he began releasing underground demo mix-tapes to small music shops. Through the popularity of these tapes, Antidote Records asked him to create an official mixtape, from which &quot;How to Cut &amp; Paste Mix Tape Vol.1&quot; was released.

He has won a DMC DJ of the Year award in the Scratch DJ category (2001) and was one of six nominees for best UK hip-hop DJ in the UK Hip-Hop Awards. He has also been nominated by &quot;Q magazine&quot; as one of the &quot;Ten DJs To See Before You Die&quot;, has released a series of mix-tapes, and has toured the globe with Goldie and the Scratch Perverts.

Yoda released his debut album of original material, entitled &quot;The Amazing Adventures of DJ Yoda&quot;, on 2 October 2006 on Antidote Records. The album features guest vocalists, including Biz Markie, Sway, Ugly Duckling and MC Paul Barman. In addition to releasing his own material, he has also performed scratches on Danger Mouse and Jemini&#x27;s &quot;Ghetto Pop Life&quot;.

He has been a regular guest on BBC Radio 1 appearing alongside Steve Lamacq and Annie Mac. In 2009, he was nominated for a Sony Radio Academy Award. In 2010, he also won the 9th Annual Independent Music Awards for Contemporary Classic Album with the Heritage Orchestra. He has been the hip-hop correspondent for &quot;IDJ magazines&quot;, and also wrote the DJ page for the now defunct &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot; magazine, and has been part of the judging panel for the DMC DJ World Finals.
In 2014 he was commissioned to create &quot;DJ Yoda Goes to the Sci-Fi Movies&quot; as part of the BFI&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Cinema&quot; event. He presented the first audio-visual radio mix on BBC Radio 6 Music. As part of their BBC Music Day, Radio 4 invited Yoda to mash-up the entire station, remixing &quot;The Archers&quot;, the Shipping Forecast, and John Humphrys.

In 2015 he was Dr. Dre&#x27;s first choice to record a guest mix on his inaugural Beats 1 show for Apple Music, and performed at Banksy&#x27;s pop-up Bemusement Park, Dismaland. 

In 2016 his &quot;Stranger Things Mix&quot; racked up more than a quarter of a million plays on SoundCloud, culminating in his UK tour of Stranger Things: The Mixtape Live. That same year, his &quot;A History of Gaming&quot; premiered at the London Film Festival, charting nostalgic video games from the early 1980s onwards.

In 2019 he released Home Cooking featuring Nubya Garcia, Eva Lazarus, Edo.G, Theon Cross, Henry Wu and Joel Culpepper. The album was released on Lewis Recordings.

<text>Collet Barker (31 December 1784 – 30 April 1831) was a British military officer and explorer. He explored areas of South Australia, Western Australia and Cobourg Peninsula, Northern Territory.

==History==
Barker was born in Hackney, England, and lived in Newbury as a child. He joined the British Army on 23 January 1806, as an ensign by purchase in the 39th Regiment of Foot; he became a lieutenant in 1809 and a captain in 1825. Barker was a veteran of the Peninsular Wars, serving in Sicily, Portugal, Spain, and France. He also served in Canada and Ireland before embarking with his regiment, the 39th Regiment of Foot 1st Battalion, on the prison hulk &quot;Phoenix&quot; for Australia; he arrived in Sydney on 18 July 1828.

===Northern Territory===
On 13 September 1828 he arrived as the new commandant of Fort Wellington, the settlement at Raffles Bay in the Northern Territory.

When Barker arrived to take up command at Fort Wellington, relations between the Aboriginal people and the settlers under the previous command of Captain Henry Smyth had deteriorated to the point of mutual fear and hostility. In his first dispatch to Governor Darling, Barker reported, &quot;Nothing has been seen of the Natives for a considerable time; they appear to have deserted the immediate neighbourhood&quot;. A series of thefts and spearings by the Aborigines led to the former commandant offering a reward of five pounds for &quot;any native who could be brought in, hoping that, by keeping such individual at the settlement, it might have the effect of preventing any further hostility&quot;.

The result of this, to further quote Darling, was a &quot;very gross outrage&quot;. A six-year-old Aboriginal girl named Riveral was captured during a raid on an encampment by six men from the settlement, including armed convicts. Private Charles Miller, in evidence sworn to an enquiry, stated the following.
It was with this background that Collet Barker began his command, on 13 September 1828. Barker first made contact with the local Aboriginal people on 25 November 1828, when Costello the stockman reported that he had made contact. Barker and Davis the surgeon were taken to the place of contact, where they met ten men, whom they presented with handkerchiefs, a pair of scissors, and some bread. The group invited Barker to accompany them, which Barker declined to do, though he tried to convey that he would be pleased to do so another time. Barker recorded his second contact with the local inhabitants in his journal, dated 2 December 1828, as follows. 
It was soon after this that the aborigines approached the settlement and were induced to enter by Barker&#x27;s sending Norrie, their Malay interpreter&#x27;s daughter, to take Wellington&#x27;s hand and lead him into the fort. Over the following months, Barker had restored relations to the point where he was able to go off alone with the locals on trips for days at a time with complete safety.

One of the reasons for the establishment of the settlement was to try to establish commercial contacts with the Malay or Macassan fishers who regularly sailed their proas to the Northern shores of Australia in search of the trepang, or sea-slugs, which they traded with the Chinese. Over the course of the year over 1000 seafarers visited the shores of Raffles Bay and showed keen interest in establishing trade with Barker&#x27;s outpost. Barker in his journals, records many Aboriginal names, words and aspects of Aboriginal culture gleaned through the regular contact that was developed with the local inhabitants. There continued to be sources of friction between the two cultures, especially the theft of the settlement&#x27;s canoes. Barker solved this by negotiating to lend the canoes and found that by the July, they were being returned with fish and tortoise shell in them as thanks.

Orders to abandon the settlement had been received before Barker&#x27;s dispatches reporting the success of his contacts with the Macassan fishers and the improvements in their relations with the Aboriginal inhabitants could affect the outcome of Governor Darling&#x27;s decision. Barker then moved on to become commandant of the British settlement at King George Sound, stopping off at the new settlement of Swan River, Perth, on the way.

===Western Australia===
The following year Barker was commander at King George Sound in Western Australia. Barker was an excellent administrator and proved to be a humane friend to the Indigenous people at both commands. He recorded Aboriginal place names, people, traditions and beliefs which otherwise might have been lost.

===South Australia===
In 1831, on the recommendation of Charles Sturt, who had visited the shoaled mouth of the Murray River the previous year, Barker was sent to explore the east coast of Gulf St Vincent in South Australia to see if another channel from the Murray entered the sea there.

On 13 April 1831, Barker and his party arrived at Cape Jervis on the &quot;Isabella&quot;. He examined the coast and found that there was no channel. Barker encountered the Onkaparinga River on 15 April. He then explored the ranges inland, north of the present site of Adelaide, and climbed Mount Lofty where he sighted the Port River inlet, Barker Inlet and the future Port Adelaide, his most important sighting. He then moored &quot;Isabella&quot; near present Yankalilla Bay and went overland to explore the area around Lake Alexandrina and Encounter Bay.

===Death===
On 29 April 1831, they reached the Murray Mouth. Barker swam across the narrow channel the next morning, went over a sandhill, and was never seen again. A few days later the party learned that Barker had been killed by the local Indigenous people who may have taken him for a whaler or sealer, many of whom had abducted Indigenous women. The men responsible had been identified, but no retaliation or punitive action against those believed responsible was undertaken, which one commentator believed emboldened those people to commit further attacks on Europeans, notably the &quot;Maria&quot; survivors.

Had he lived, Barker was to have been sent by Governor Darling to New Zealand&#x27;s North Island as first resident because of the feared Māori unrest; his role was to conciliate.

==Recognition==
Mount Barker was named for him by Captain Sturt, who erroneously thought it was Mount Lofty, and the eponymous town is named for the mountain. The town of Mount Barker, Western Australia and the electoral division of Division of Barker in south-eastern South Australia are also named for him.

==Personal life==
Barker never married. His nearest relations were Collet Dobson Collet, nephew; Clara Collet, great niece; Edward Dobson, New Zealand engineer, nephew; and great nephews, Sir Arthur Dudley Dobson, New Zealand survey engineer, and George Dobson, New Zealand surveyor, who was murdered in 1866 by the Burgess gang.

<text>Henry is a comic strip created in 1932 by Carl Thomas Anderson. The title character is a young bald boy who is mostly mute in the comics (and sometimes drawn minus a mouth). Except in a few early episodes, when the comic strip character communicates, he does so largely but not entirely through pantomime. He also spoke in a comic book series of 1946–1961 and in at least one Betty Boop cartoon from 1935 in which Betty Boop has a pet shop and Henry speaks to a dog in the window.

&quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; was the first publication to feature &quot;Henry&quot;, a series which began when Anderson was 67 years old. The series of cartoons continued in that magazine for two years in various formats of one, two, or multiple panels. It then moved to newspaper syndication on December 17, 1934. Anderson stopped drawing due to arthritis in 1942, and the strip continued with other artists.

The daily strip went into reruns in 1995, and the Sunday strip in 2005. After 84 years of syndication, &quot;Henry&quot; was discontinued on October 28, 2018.

==From cartoons to comic strip==
After seeing a German publication of &quot;Henry&quot;, William Randolph Hearst signed Anderson to King Features Syndicate and began distributing the comic strip on December 17, 1934, with the half-page Sunday strip launched March 10, 1935. &quot;Henry&quot; was replaced in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; by Marjorie Henderson Buell&#x27;s &quot;Little Lulu&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Post&quot; cartoons featuring Henry are credited with early positive depictions of African-American characters during an era when African-Americans were often unflatteringly depicted.
Anderson&#x27;s assistant on the Sunday strip was Don Trachte. His assistant on the dailies was John Liney. In 1942, arthritis kept Anderson away from the drawing board and Trachte enlisted for WWII, so Anderson turned both the daily and Sunday strip over to Liney. When Trachte returned in 1945, Liney continued to draw the dailies, and Trachte drew the Sunday strips. Liney retired in 1979, but Trachte continued with the Sunday strips until the end of the run in 2005.

After Liney&#x27;s retirement, Jack Tippit took over the dailies until 1983. Dick Hodgins, Jr. worked on the dailies from 1983 until 1995, when the daily strip concluded. About 75 newspapers still ran classic &quot;Henry&quot; strips. These were also available through King Features&#x27; Comics Kingdom.

==Characters and story==
Cartoonist Art Baxter analyzed the appeal of the character and the strip:
:&quot;Henry&quot; was a strip that was supposed to be contemporary, but it never looked that way. There were almost no modern trappings. There may be cars or telephones, but that&#x27;s about it. It always seemed like Henry could always find the coal wagon, horse-drawn ice delivery or a five-cent ice cream cone. There were always shadings of nostalgia in the strip, even when it began in the Depression. Part of that has to do with the fact that &quot;Henry&quot;&#x27;s creator, Carl Anderson, was already an old man in his late sixties when he created the character by accident. Henry is autonomous in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; strips. &quot;Henry&quot; would not pick up a regular cast of characters, all with no proper names, only titles: the mother, the dog, the bully, the little girl, until it became a William Randolph Hearst comic strip. &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; &quot;Henry&quot; is similar in many ways to the &quot;Little Rascals&quot;/&quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies of the same era. That is children free from the tyranny of an adult presence (mostly): children navigating the world as best they can with the knowledge and experience they currently possess; sometimes getting things right, often getting things wrong, and frequently coming up with solutions to problems unique to their limited experience. Necessity is the mother of invention, with funny, surprising results. Later strips of &quot;Henry&quot; would be somewhat a reversal of earlier themes, such as adults having the last word when Henry and his friends misbehave, or Henry walking around town to see free samples of common household items, then seeing another sign advertising ice cream for expensive prices, to his unspoken consternation.
==Derivative works==

Henry appears (and speaks) alongside Betty Boop in the Fleischer Studios animated short &quot;Betty Boop with Henry, the Funniest Living American&quot; (1935).

During the period of 1946 to 1961, Dell Comics published 61 issues of a color comic book titled &quot;Carl Anderson&#x27;s Henry&quot;. Henry spoke in the comic book, as did the other principal characters.

<doc id="1141353" wikidata="Q1254345" url="?curid=1141353" title="Superbit">
<text>Superbit was a brand of premium DVD-Video versions of motion pictures from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment. Superbit DVDs aimed to improve picture quality over a standard DVD edition of a feature by increasing the bit rate of the encoded video. Audio quality was also improved by the mandatory inclusion of both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround audio tracks.

== Design ==

Superbit discs can be read by all regular DVD video players, but their film files were encoded at a bit rate that is, according to Sony, approximately 1.5 times higher (6-7 Mbit/s) than standard DVDs (4-5 Mbit/s), which helps minimize artifacts caused by video compression and allow the image to be pre-filtered less prior to compression, which results in more detail.

To maximize space for the main feature, static menus are used and commentary tracks are removed. To further improve the size and therefore quality of the film on the disc, Superbit discs contained a reduced amount (and usually completely devoid) of bonus materials, such as documentaries or interviews, which can be found on regular DVDs. All Superbit releases present the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio.

In addition to maximizing the bitrate for improved audio and video, the Superbit line introduced seamless layer changes. Prior to this line of Sony DVDs, all dual layer DVDs caused a slight pause during playback when the layer change occurred. Some standard DVDs had their layer changes placed in scenes where they were almost imperceptible. Superbit DVD were the only optical media discs produced that had true seamless layer changes until Blu-ray was introduced.

== History ==

The Superbit line launched in October 2001 with five titles: &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, &quot;Air Force One&quot;, &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;. Following the initial release of the Superbit line, &quot;Superbit Deluxe&quot; was introduced, which bundled a Superbit-quality feature with a second disc containing the special features. In January 2007, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment discontinued its Superbit line in order to promote its Blu-ray Disc format.

Some of the most popular Superbit releases were the Sam Raimi films &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. The multi-disc Superbit titles (meaning the films spanning more than one disc) included &quot;Das Boot&quot; as well as David Lean’s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; but in order to maximize the bitrate for AV-quality the title was not split where enthusiasts were expecting: the intermission interlude. This led many fans of the film to ignore the release. &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; was also limited to a single movie disc in many regions when the Blu-ray debuted with Sony’s Blu-ray version of Superbit ‘Mastered in 4K’ line. Only Japan got a ‘Mastered in 4K’ where the film spanned multiple discs with the disc split finally occurring at the more appropriate intermission interlude. The UHD Blu-ray of &quot;Lawrence&quot; was split across two triple layer BD100s at the appropriate spot again when debuting on that format with the Columbia Classics VoI. 1 UHD Blu-ray box set.

<text>Henry Tuke (24 March 1755 – 11 August 1814) co-founded with his father, William Tuke, the Retreat asylum in York, England, a humane alternative to the nineteenth-century network of asyla, based on Quaker principles.

He was the author of several moral and theological treatises which have been translated into German and French.

He was a subscriber to the African Institution, the body which set out to create a viable, civilized refuge for freed slaves in Sierra Leone, Africa.

==Historic ship==
The 1824 ship &quot;Henry Tuke&quot;, 365 tons, was built by Thatcher Magoun in Medford, MA, and owned by Daniel Pinckney Parker and John Chandler, Jr. It was a whaler in Warren, RI in 1846.

<doc id="1141361" wikidata="Q1409564" url="?curid=1141361" title="Red-Headed Woman">
<text>Red-Headed Woman is a 1932 American pre-Code romantic comedy film, produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, based on the 1931 novel of the same name by Katharine Brush, and a screenplay by Anita Loos. It was directed by Jack Conway and stars Jean Harlow as a woman who uses sex to advance her social position. During the course of the film, Harlow&#x27;s character breaks up a marriage, has multiple affairs, and attempts to kill a man.

==Plot==
Lillian &quot;Lil&quot; Andrews (Jean Harlow) is a young woman, living in Renwood, Ohio, who will do anything to improve herself. She seduces her wealthy boss William &quot;Bill&quot; Legendre Jr. (Chester Morris) and cleverly breaks up his marriage with his loving wife Irene (Leila Hyams). Irene reconsiders and tries to reconcile with Bill, only to find he has married Lil the previous day.

However, Lil finds herself shunned by high society, including Bill&#x27;s father, Will Legendre, Sr. (Lewis Stone), because of her lower-class origins and homewrecking. When Charles B. Gaerste (Henry Stephenson), a nationally known coal tycoon and the main customer of the Legendres&#x27; company, visits the city, Lil thinks she has found a way to force her way into the highest social circles. She seduces Charles, then blackmails him into throwing a party at her mansion, knowing that no one would dare offend him by not showing up. It seems a social coup for Lil, until her hairdresser friend and confidante Sally (Una Merkel) points out that all the guests have left early to attend a surprise party for Irene (who lives across the street).

Humiliated, she decides to move to New York City, even if it means a temporary separation from her husband. Will Sr. finds Lil&#x27;s handkerchief at Gaerste&#x27;s place and correctly guesses what Lil has done. He shows his evidence to his son, who hires detectives to watch Lil. They find that she is conducting not one, but two affairs, with Charles and his handsome French chauffeur Albert (Charles Boyer). Bill shows Charles damning photographs.

When Lil learns that Charles has found out about her, she returns to Bill, only to find him with Irene. Furious, she shoots him, but he survives and refuses to have her charged with attempted murder. However, he does divorce her, and remarries Irene. Two years later, he sees her again, at a racetrack in Paris, in the company of an aged Frenchman. He discreetly hides Irene&#x27;s binoculars. In the final scene, Lil and her elderly companion get into a limousine driven by Albert.

==Production==
The film proved difficult from its inception. F. Scott Fitzgerald and Marcel de Sano were originally hired to collaborate on creating a script adapted from Katherine Brush&#x27;s 1931 novel. Fitzgerald initially turned down MGM&#x27;s offer as their offer of $750 per week was not satisfactory; producer Irving Thalberg, however, raised the sum to $1,200 since he wanted Fitzgerald&#x27;s name on the project. Fitzgerald then objected to working with de Sano, insisting that he work alone, but he was forced to comply. The two quickly experienced a falling out, but still finished the script in five weeks. Despite all this effort, however, Thalberg was concerned that the original story and the first draft of a script by Fitzgerald and de Sano was too serious, and offered the job of rewriting it to Anita Loos, instructing her to provide something that was more fun and playful and with a greater emphasis on comedy. MGM then hired Anita Loos, who completed rough and revised drafts of the script between January and February 1932. (Both scripts are currently owned by Yale University at The Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library.)

&quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; was filmed at MGM Studios in Culver City, California. MGM&#x27;s &quot;English House&quot; and &quot;New York Street&quot; backlots – both located in Lot 2 – were primary filming locations for the production.

Before casting Harlow, MGM considered casting Clara Bow as Lillian Andrews, who originally agreed to take the part but objected to the &quot;future services&quot; option demanded by the studio. &quot;Screenland&quot; (June 1932) (pg.60) also noted that Colleen Moore was considered for the part. In its April 12, 1932 issues, however, &quot;Motion Picture&quot; magazine (pg.11) reported seeing Jean Harlow at the premiere of the film &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; sporting red, &quot;titian hair&quot;, suggesting she was involved in the production. The &quot;Modern Screen&quot; gossip column in &quot;The Hollywood Times&quot; confirmed these suspicions in May 1932 stating: &quot;Guess who is going to be MGM&#x27;s &#x27;Red-Headed Woman&#x27;? No other than that famous platinum blonde, Jean Harlow. They will either have to get a new title for the picture, or a very large bottle of very extra red henna for Jean&#x27;s crowning glory.&quot; The opening scene of the film shows Harlow&#x27;s character getting her hair dyed red. The film&#x27;s first line of dialogue is &quot;So gentlemen prefer blondes, do they? Ha!&quot; The film, in fact, was Jean Harlow&#x27;s first film after having left Hollywood for a few months following a fall-out with Howard Hughes, as reported by &quot;Screenland&quot;.

Although uncredited, Jean Harlow&#x27;s husband Paul Bern was the film&#x27;s production supervisor.

Prior to the film&#x27;s release, producer Thalberg worked with the Will Hays Office to shore up the censor&#x27;s approval. Of particular concern were several scenes in which Harlow was partially undressed or making obvious sexual advances. Thalberg eventually agreed to seventeen cuts. Despite this fact, the film still received a number of complaints from cinema patrons.

==Reception==
Critical response to &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; was overwhelmingly positive. McCarthy of the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; wrote: &quot;Sexy, racy, bristling with snappy dialogue, funny, [&quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot;] is loaded with dynamite that can be dynamic entertainment, or an explosion of objections unless you handle it properly and with all the finesse and ability that your showmanship experience commands.&quot; The September 1932 edition of &quot;Screenland&quot; also gave the film a glowing review, writing: &quot;The film [&quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot;] follows Katherine Brush&#x27;s novel with satirical improvements by Anita Loos, who, fed up with blondes, gives red-headed women their due... See this for sheer amusement. Jean plays a mean part so cleverly that you can&#x27;t help liking this wild red-headed woman.&quot; Along with this review, &quot;Screenland&quot; chose &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; as one of the six best pictures of the month and named Harlow&#x27;s performance &quot;one of the ten best portrayals of the month.&quot; (September 1932, pp. 356–357).

&quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; opened in France as &quot;La Belle Aux Cheveux Roux&quot; and in Spain as &quot;La Pelirroja&quot;. Zárraga, a reporter for &quot;Cine-Mundial&quot;, (September 1932, p. 585), a Spanish-language magazine, wrote: &quot;&quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; was predestined to triumph. Step-by-step [Harlow] succeeded, and the secret of her success was not precisely in her statuary beauty, nor in her famous platinum-colored hair: it was, above all, in her disturbing way of kissing...&quot; The film was banned in the United Kingdom.

<text>John Cournos, born Ivan Grigorievich Korshun () (6 March 1881 – 27 August 1966), was an American writer and translator.

==Biography==
Cournos was born in Zhytomyr, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine) in Russian Jewish family and his first language was Yiddish; he studied Russian, German, and Hebrew with a tutor at home. When he was 10 years old his family emigrated to Philadelphia, where he learned English.

=== Literary career ===
In June 1912, Cournos moved to London, where he freelanced as an interviewer and critic for both UK and US publications and began his literary career as a poet and, later, novelist. He later emigrated to the US, where he spent the rest of his life.

He was one of the Imagist poets, but is better known for his novels, short stories, essays, and criticism, as well as a translator of Russian literature. He used the pseudonym &quot;John Courtney&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;The Philadelphia Record&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Gorky.&quot;

Later in life he married Helen Kestner Satterthwaite (1893–1960), who was also an author and published under the pseudonyms Sybil Norton and John Hawk. However, Cournos is better-known for his unhappy affair with Dorothy L. Sayers, fictionalised by Sayers in the detective book &quot;Strong Poison&quot; (1930) and by Cournos himself in &quot;The Devil Is an English Gentleman&quot; (1932).

Cournos and his wife, under her pseudonym Sybil Norton, collaborated on several books, including &quot;Famous Modern American Novelists&quot;, &quot;Famous British Novelists&quot;, &quot;Best World Short Stories of 1947&quot;, and &quot;John Adams&quot; a biography.

=== Anti-communism ===
In the aftermath of the October Revolution Cournos was involved with a London-based anti-Communist organisation, the Russian Liberation Committee. On its behalf, he wrote in 1919 a propaganda pamphlet, &quot;London under the Bolsheviks: A Londoner&#x27;s Dream on Returning from Petrograd&quot;, based largely on what he saw during his 1917–1918 visit to Aleksey Remizov in Petrograd, whose &quot;Chasy&quot; he was then translating as &quot;The Clock&quot;. It closely follows the early events of the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, and it was set in Britain to better enable the British audience to imagine what it was like. Sinclair Lewis used the same device to imagine a Fascist takeover in the United States in his 1935 work &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;.

In Cournos&#x27;s lurid but humorous future history, a British revolutionary regime introduces a new currency named &quot;The MacDonald&quot; for Ramsay MacDonald, who is, however, soon shoved aside by the Bolshevik leaders &quot;MacLenin&quot; and &quot;Trotsman&quot; (obvious satires of Lenin and Trotsky). A counter-revolutionary drive by General Haig is defeated at St Albans, and the Bolsheviks start rounding up their former allies. Lloyd George is imprisoned in the Tower of London. H. G. Wells, too, is imprisoned by the Bolsheviks, despite his left-leaning book &quot;Love and Mr Lewisham&quot;. London is portrayed as plagued by poverty, with black market cigarettes and broken lifts, and the narrator wanders round the Strand exclaiming at the filth of the streets, the idlers and the jealous envy towards his new boots.

=== Death ===
Cournos died in New York City.

== In fiction ==
Dorothy L. Sayers was his lover in 1920s. She described their lovestory in her detective novel &quot;Strong Poison&quot; (1930)&quot;:&quot; her alter-ego female novelist Harriet Vane had an affair with writer Phillip Boyes (Cournos). Sayers&#x27; sublimation is obvious in this novel: Boyes is murdered and Vane is defendant.

<doc id="1141367" wikidata="Q1816282" url="?curid=1141367" title="On2 Technologies">
<text>On2 Technologies, formerly known as The Duck Corporation, was a small publicly traded company (on the American Stock Exchange), founded in New York City in 1992 and headquartered in Clifton Park, New York, that designed video codec technology. It created a series of video codecs called TrueMotion (including TrueMotion S, TrueMotion 2, TrueMotion RT 2.0, TrueMotion VP3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).

In February 2010, On2 Technologies was acquired by Google for an estimated $124.6 million. On2&#x27;s VP8 technology became the core of Google&#x27;s WebM video file format.

== History ==
While known by the name &quot;The Duck Corporation&quot;, they developed TrueMotion S, a codec that was used by some games for full motion video (FMV) sequences during the 1990s. The original office of the Duck Corporation was founded in New York City by Daniel B. Miller, Victor Yurkovsky, and Stan Marder. In 1994 Duck opened its first &quot;satellite&quot; engineering office in Colonie, NY under the management of Eric Ameres. Miller became CEO of newly renamed On2 Technologies until Doug McIntyre was hired in late 2000, when Miller resumed his role as CTO. CEO&#x27;s after McIntyre included Bill Joll and Matt Frost.

After Miller&#x27;s departure in 2003, newly promoted CTO Eric Ameres moved the primary engineering office to upstate NY&#x27;s capital region. Ameres later departed in 2007 to pursue other research as part of the opening of the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at his alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). After Ameres&#x27; departure in 2007 Paul Wilkins served as co-CTO with Jim Bankoski. Wilkins was founder of &quot;Metavisual&quot; which was acquired by On2 in 1999 to bring the VP3 codec to market. The VP3 codec became the basis of On2&#x27;s future codecs as well as the basis of the open source Theora video codec.

In 1995, The Duck Corporation raised $1.7 million in venture funding from Edelson Technology Partners.

In 1997, they raised an additional $7 million in a venture round primarily financed by Citigroup Ventures.

In 1999, The Duck Corporation merged with Applied Capital Funding, Inc., a public company on the American Stock Exchange. The merged entity was first renamed On2.Com and then On2 Technologies, trading on the AMEX as ONT. ONT&#x27;s price peaked at a little over $40 per share, briefly giving the company a market cap in excess of $1 billion.

On April 4, 2000, On2 buys Quickband, Inc. (&quot;Quickband&quot;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, acquired substantially all of the assets of DVD Mags, Inc. (&quot;DVD Mags&quot;), a California corporation in the business of aggregating and producing short-form entertainment content for distribution across digital and traditional channels (the &quot;Quickband Acquisition&quot;). The Quickband Acquisition was effected pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (&quot;Purchase Agreement&quot;) dated as of March 9, 2000 by and among the company, Quickband and DVD Mags.

On November 3, 2000, On2 acquired the game engine development company Eight Cylinders Studios.

In May 2007, On2 announced an agreement to acquire Finnish Hantro Products, a provider of video codecs for chips for wireless devices. The acquisition was finalized on November 1, 2007.

In November 2008, On2 announced that it would partner with Zencoder to create Flix Cloud, a high-capacity online video encoding service using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Flix Cloud launched in April 2009.

=== Acquisition by Google ===
On 5 August 2009, Google offered to acquire On2 Technologies for $106.5 million in Google stock. On 7 January 2010, Google increased its offer to $133.9 million, and on February 17, 2010, the stockholders of On2 Technologies voted to accept the offer. On 19 February 2010, the transaction was completed, valued at approximately $124.6 million.

After this purchase, the following message was posted on the on2.com website: &quot;The On2 products Flix Pro, Flix Standard, Flix Exporter, Flix PowerPlayers, Flix Live, Flix DirectShow SDK, Flix Publisher and Flix Engine are no longer for sale.&quot;

==Technology==

===TrueMotion S===
According to the company itself, development started in the early 1990s. The first versions of the codec were mainly targeted at and used for full motion video scenes in computer games. One of the codec&#x27;s competitive advantages in this field was that, unlike MPEG, it does not require a separate decoder, thus reducing costs to game publishers. At the time, MPEG&#x27;s dominance was nearly secured, especially with hardware-implementations of the codec, meant to run on special hardware boards only.

This was the first version in the TrueMotion series of proprietary lossy video compression formats and video codec. This format compressed frame in either a 32-bit or 16-bit RGB color space with a FourCC of codice_1 (or codice_2 for a version of TrueMotion S that was licensed by Horizon Technologies). It is usually put in an AVI container. The filename extension varies from game to game. Some leave it with codice_3, other games use codice_4 or codice_5. Gaming consoles which were licensed to use the codec include the Sega Saturn, Sega 32X, and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Simon &amp; Schuster first person games such as &quot;Star Trek: Borg&quot; also used the compression format. Some of the files can be played back with a video player that uses the libavcodec library, such as MPlayer.

In 1995, Horizons Technology Inc. began shipping the TrueMotion-S Compressor software for Macintosh and MS Windows. TrueMotion-S was originally developed by the Duck Corp. for applications such as the Sega game box.

In 1996, the main competitors for TrueMotion S software codec were Cinepak and Indeo in games for first-generation CD-ROM based game consoles.

===TrueMotion RT===
The &quot;real time&quot; version in the series was released in 1996. It was meant for real time capturing and processing of digital video.

===TrueMotion 2===
The second version in this series only supported a 24-bit RGB color space optimized for Windows rendering which orders components as BGR with a FourCC of &quot;TM20&quot;. Used for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot;.

In 1997, Microsoft Corp. licensed The Duck Corp.&#x27;s TrueMotion 2.0 video codec technology to bring TV-quality video to the PC platform.

===DK ADPCM Audio 3/4===
There are two obsolete versions for associated ADPCM audio compression.

===TrueMotion VP3/4===

On June 1, 2000, brought version 3.1; August 16, 2000 version 3.2. The third version in the series switched to using a planar Y&#x27;CbCr 4:2:0 color space.

In late 2001, On2 released their VP3(.2) compression technology into the open-source community including their patents on the technology. The technology lives on in the form of Theora. The Xiph.Org Foundation created its codec &quot;Theora&quot; as a fork of the codebase of VP3.2. The forked version added 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 sub sampling for better color quality options.

In April 2001 VP4 was published, which brought an improved encoder for the same bitstream format.

=== TrueMotion VP5/6 ===

A preview version of VP5 was published on February 21, 2002, with production version being available as of May 1, 2002. The production version of VP5 codec was released in May 2002.

When the codec was in beta, to preview its quality, On2 created a plug-in for RealPlayer. Lately the final version of the codec was ready. The VP5 codec was limited, when the VP6 came out.
The sixth version like VP3 and VP4 kept the same bitstream as VP5 and added an optional alpha channel to the color space.

In April 2003 AOL has bought broad licensing rights for VP5 and VP6 codecs. More recently, On2 licensed its technology to AOL for use in an IP-based video telephony product, to Tencent Holdings of China for use in its instant messaging products, and to Saver Corporation of Japan to enable new Flash 8 mobile video applications.

On May 12, 2003, On2 announced the release of VP6. Revised versions 6.1 and 6.2 followed later that year.
Since October 2003 it may be used free of charge for personal use.

In late 2003, On2 announced that its VP5 and VP6 codecs were selected by Beijing E-World as a video coding method to be used in a Chinese-developed competitor to the DVD format called the EVD (Enhanced Versatile Disc) format. Then in April 2004, On2 announced that its business relationship with E-World had soured, and that On2 would file multiple breach of contract claims against E-World in arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator reached a conclusion on March 10, 2005, according to SEC filings by On2 on March 14, 2005. The arbitrator dismissed each of On2&#x27;s claims and ruled that E-World owed nothing to On2 and had not breached the contract. It seems unlikely that On2 will ultimately get any significant payback from the EVD initiative, although some contract relationship remains in effect.

A number of less highly visible deals with other customers and partners seem to have worked out more amicably than the Chinese DVD project. Recent announcements have related to deals with Apex Datacom, IWAPI Inc., Vividas, Digital Witness, XM Satellite Radio, PowerLinx, and LeapFrog Enterprises. In particular, the company indicated that it expected to recognize some revenue from the Leapfrog deal in the third quarter of 2005 and also made optimistic statements about the future with XM Satellite Radio.

In 2004, On2&#x27;s VP6 was selected for use as the Macromedia Flash Video 8 codec. This apparently stems from a deal made in the second quarter of 2004 with revenue in that quarter of $1.4 million for the licensing agreement. In related news, On2 announced on April 5, 2005, that it had acquired the Flix Flash video encoder technology from Wildform, Inc. On2 added support for Flash 8 video output to the Flix 8 product line that they released on September 13, 2005.

=== TrueMotion VP7 ===

The seventh version changed the bitstream from previous versions for better coding efficiency and was released in March 2005; since July it may be used free of charge for personal use.

It is a codec with both VFW and DirectShow support that On2 Technologies claims has better compression than leading competitive codecs such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) and VC-1.

On2 Technologies announced TrueMotion VP7 in January 2005. The public release of VP7 codec software was available in March 2005.

On March 9, 2005, On2 announced a new codec, VP7. On2 claimed that VP7 is superior to the H.264/AVC standard, based on claims of comparative technical capabilities and licensing costs. This claim has been disputed by a developer of x264, a popular H.264 encoder.

In April 2005, On2 Technologies licensed On2 Video Codecs (including VP6 and VP7) for Macromedia Flash.

On December 1, 2005, Skype announced that they had licensed current and future versions of its video compression software and had integrated it into the beta version of Skype 2.0 for point-to-point video conferencing Skype protocol. No financial terms were disclosed relating to the deal.

On August 13, 2007, On2 announced the addition of H.264 support to its On2 Flix product line.

Move Networks also used the VP7 codec in its Move Media Player plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer, used by ABC and Fox for its streaming of full network shows.

=== TrueMotion VP8 ===

VP8 was published in 2008 and marked the transfer of formats to Google with their acquisition of On2 and was open sourced on May 19, 2010. The VP8 codec was licensed under a BSD license.

<doc id="1141370" wikidata="Q707508" url="?curid=1141370" title="1941 Odessa massacre">
<text>The Odessa massacre was the mass murder of the Jewish population of Odessa and surrounding towns in the Transnistria Governorate during the autumn of 1941 and the winter of 1942 while it was under Romanian control. It was one of the worst massacres in Ukrainian territory.

Depending on the accepted terms of reference and scope, the Odessa massacre refers either to the events of October 22–24, 1941 in which some 25,000 to 34,000 Jews were shot or burned, or to the murder of well over 100,000 Jews in the town and the areas between the Dniester and Bug rivers, during the Romanian and German occupation which took place following the massacre. As of 2018, it was estimated that up to 30,000 people, mostly Ukrainian Jews, were murdered in the actual massacre, which occurred October 22–23, 1941. The primary perpetrators were Romanian soldiers, Einsatzgruppe SS and local ethnic Germans.

== Background ==
Before the war, Odessa had a large Jewish population of approximately 200,000, or 30% of the city&#x27;s total population. By the time the Romanians had taken the city, between 80,000 and 90,000 Jews remained, the rest having fled or been evacuated by the Soviets. As the massacres occurred, Jews from surrounding villages were interned in Odessa and Romanian concentration camps set up in the surrounding areas.

On October 16, following a two-month siege of Odessa, the Germans and Romanians captured the city.

==Mass killings of hostages and Jews on October 22–24==
=== Destruction of the Romanian commandant&#x27;s office ===

On October 22, 1941, in the building of the NKVD on the Marazlievskaya street where the Romanian military commander&#x27;s office and the headquarters of the Romanian 10th Infantry Division had settled to occupy the city, a radio-controlled mine exploded. The mine had been planted there by the sappers of the Red Army before the surrender of the city by Soviet troops. The building collapsed, and under its rubble, 67 people were killed, including 16 officers, among whom was the military commander of the city, Romanian General Ioan Glogojeanu. Responsibility for the explosion was placed on the Jews and Communists.

=== The execution of hostages ===

In response to the explosion at the commandant&#x27;s office, General Nicolae Tătăranu received a direct order from Marshal Ion Antonescu, ordering &quot;immediate reprisals&quot; be carried out on the Jewish population. The Romanian troops and the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; arrived in Odessa on October 23 to kill from 5,000 to 10,000 hostages, many of whom were Jews.

Across the Marazlievskaya street, occupiers broke into the apartments of Odessa citizens and shot or hanged all residents found, without exception. They raided the streets and markets of the city and suburbs, and people who knew nothing of the bombing were shot on sight against fences or the walls of houses. Nearly 100 men were seized and shot at the Big Fountain, about two hundred people were executed in the Slobodka neighborhood near the market, 251 residents were shot in Moldavanka, Near and Far Windmills and in Aleksandrovsky Prospekt about 400 townspeople were executed. The columns of the captured hostages were driven to the area of artillery warehouses on Lustdorf Road, where they were shot or burned alive.

After the war, more than 22,000 corpses were found in mass graves.

=== The beginning of the Holocaust ===

On October 23, an order was issued threatening all Jews with death on the spot and ordering them to report to the village of Dalnyk on October 24. In the afternoon of October 24, about 5,000 Jews were gathered near the outpost of Dalnyk. The first 50 people were brought to the anti-tank ditch and shot by the commander of the 10th machine-gun battalion, Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolae Deleanu.

To speed up the process of destruction, the Jews were driven into four barracks, in which holes were made for machine guns, and the floor was pre-filled with gasoline. People in two barracks were shot with machine guns on the same day. At 17:00 the barracks were set on fire. The next day, the prisoners were shot, placed in the remaining two barracks, and in one of the barracks grenades were thrown.

Meanwhile, the Jews who were not selected for the first group, and who had already arrived in Dalnyk, were told that they were &quot;forgiven&quot;. They were sent to various military headquarters and Gendarmerie stations for &quot;registration&quot;, where they were detained for different lengths of time. When they were released, they discovered that their houses had been occupied and their property plundered.

During the first week of Romanian occupation of Odessa, the city lost about 10% of its inhabitants.

== Subsequent events ==


The registration carried out by the Romanian administration in late 1941 counted about 60,000 Jews in Odesa. This number included persons having only one Jewish ancestor. Jews were required to wear a special distinctive badge, a yellow hexagram (Magen David, the Star of David, a symbol of Judaism) on a black background.

On November 7, 1941, an order was issued, making it mandatory for all male Jews from 18 to 50 years old to report to the city prison.

From that day on, the entire Jewish population of the city was sent to concentration camps, organized by Romanians in the countryside, primarily to the village of (now in the Mykolaiv Oblast). Later, a ghetto was arranged in Odessa itself.

The Romanian administration took measures to seize the property of future victims. In mid-November, a new order was issued clarifying the authorities&#x27; demands for Jews. It said:

By the middle of December, about 55,000 Jews were gathered in Bogdanovka, though some of them were not from Odessa. From December 20, 1941, until January 15, 1942, each of them was shot by a team of the Einsatzgruppe SS, Romanian soldiers, Ukrainian police and local German colonists.

A month later, a death march of 10,000 Jews was organized in three concentration camps in Golta.

In January 1942, about 35,000-40,000 of the Jews left in Odessa were evicted and sent to the ghetto that had been created on January 10, 1942, in the poor area of Slobodka. The evicted endured terrible conditions; with inadequate housing for all and severe crowding, many were forced out into the open winter air, which led to mass mortality from hypothermia.

From January 12 to February 20, 1942, the remaining 19,582 Jews were deported to Berezivka Raion of Odessa Oblast. They were transported in unheated , and many died on the road. In Berezivka, groups were forced to walk to Domanevka, Bogdanovka, Golta and other concentration camps. Many died of hunger and cold along the way. The guards, consisting of Romanian and German soldiers, organized mass executions of Jews during the journeys. In 18 months, almost all the prisoners of Golta died.

== The survivors of the Holocaust ==

Some Jews were sent to work in the villages, and about half of them survived the occupation. The situation in the ghetto of Domanevka and other ghettos in Transnistria improved in 1943 after the Jews began to receive assistance from Jewish organizations in Romania. About 600 Odessa residents in these ghettos lived to be released. Several hundred Jews who were hiding in Odessa itself also survived. Jews participated in the struggle of the Odessa underground and constituted a significant part of the guerrilla units, based in the Odesa catacombs.

== Trials and punishment of the main perpetrators ==

At the Bucharest People&#x27;s Tribunal, set up in 1946 by the new Romanian government in conjunction with the Allied Control Council, one of the charges brought against Marshal Ion Antonescu, the Governor of Transnistria, Gheorghe Alexianu, and the commander of the Odessa garrison, General Nicolae Macici, was &quot;the organization of repressions against the civilian population of Odessa autumn of 1941&quot;. For these crimes, they were sentenced to death. The first two were shot on July 1, 1946. Later, King Michael commuted Macici&#x27;s death sentence to life imprisonment. Macici died in prison in 1950.

In response to the appeal of the verdict filed by the son of Alexianu, on November 5, 2006, Bucharest Court of Appeal confirmed the verdict of war criminals to death, dated May 17, 1946. In response to the appeal filed by the Prosecutor General, on May 6, 2008, the case was re-examined and the judges of the High Court of Cassation and Justice finally rejected the application for revision of the 1946 sentence.

== Commemoration ==

=== Memorial in Prokhorovsky Square ===

In the early 1990s in Odessa&#x27;s Prokhorovsky Square, where the &quot;road of death&quot; to the extermination camps for Odessa&#x27;s Jews and Gypsies had begun on the outskirts of the city in 1941, a memorial commemorating the victims of the Holocaust was created. A memorial sign was installed, along with the &quot;Alley of the Righteous Among the World&quot;, featuring trees planted in honor of each Odessa citizen who had harbored and saved the Jews. The complex was completed in 2004 with the erection of a monument to the victims of the Holocaust in Odessa by sculptor Zurab Tsereteli.

=== The Holocaust Museum in Odessa ===
The Museum of the Holocaust in Odesa was created in accordance with the decision of the Council of the Odesa Regional Association of Jews, former prisoners of the ghetto and Nazi concentration camps. The chairman of the association is Roman Shvartsman. The opening of the museum took place on June 22, 2009.

=== Other ===

In January 2015, the authorities of the Italian town of Ceriano Laghetto, in the province of Monza-e-Brianza in the Lombardy region, named a city square &quot;Martyrs Square of Odesa&quot; in memory of the victims of the occupation regimes in Odesa: Jews killed October 22–24, 1941, as well as anti-Maidan activists, rescuers and accidental victims who died on May 2, 2014, in the Odesa Trade Union House.

On May 2, 2015, the first anniversary of the events in the House of Trade Unions, a commemorative monument dedicated to the &quot;Martyrs of Odesa&quot; was opened at this square. The monument is a tongue of flame with a silhouette of a dove, a symbol of the world, inside.

The 2018 tragicomic Romanian film &quot;I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians&quot; deals with the massacre and historical memory among modern Romanians.

<text>Yiddishism is a cultural and linguistic movement that advocates and promotes the use of the Yiddish language. It began among Jews in Eastern Europe during the latter part of the 19th century. Some of the leading founders of this movement were Mendele Moykher-Sforim (1836–1917), I. L. Peretz (1852–1915), and Sholem Aleichem (1859–1916). The Yiddishist movement gained popularity alongside the growth of the Jewish Labor Bund and other Jewish political movements, particularly in the Russian Empire and United States. The movement also fluctuated throughout the 20th and 21st century because of the revival of the Hebrew language and the negative associations with the Yiddish language.

==19th-century origins==
The Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, movement that arose in the late 18th century played a large role in rejecting Yiddish as a Jewish language. However, many &quot;maskilim,&quot; particularly in the Russian Empire, expanded the Yiddish press to use it as a tool to spread their enlightenment ideas, thereby building a platform for future Yiddishists. Aleksander Zederbaum, a prominent member of the Haskalah, founded the influential Yiddish periodical &quot;Kol Mevasser&quot;, which would become a mainstay of the Yiddish press, including not only news but also stories and several novels in serialization. 

In 1861, Yehoshua Mordechai Lifshitz (1828–1878), who is considered the father of Yiddishism and Yiddish lexicography, circulated an essay entitled “The Four Classes” () in which he referred to Yiddish as a completely separate language from both German and Hebrew and, in the European context of his audience, the &quot;mother tongue&quot; of the Jewish people. In this essay, which was eventually published in 1863 in an early issue of the influential Yiddish periodical &quot;Kol Mevasser&quot;, he contended that the refinement and development of Yiddish were indispensable for the humanization and education of Jews. In a subsequent essay published in the same periodical, he also proposed Yiddish as a bridge linking Jewish and European cultures. Scholar Mordkhe Schaechter characterizes Lifshitz as &quot;[t]he first conscious, goal-oriented language reformer&quot; in the field of Yiddish, and highlights his pivotal role in countering the negative attitudes toward the language propagated within the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment movement:

Although an adherent of the Enlightenment, [Lifshitz] broke with its sterile anti-Yiddish philosophy, to become an early ideologue of Yiddishism and of Yiddish-language planning. He courageously stood up for the denigrated folk tongue, calling for its elevation and cultivation. He did this in the form of articles in the weekly &quot;Kol-mevaser&quot; (in the 1860s) and in his excellent Russian-Yiddish and Yiddish-Russian dictionaries [...].Several prominent Yiddish authors also emerged in this time, transforming the perception of Yiddish from a &quot;jargon&quot; of no literary value into an accepted artistic language. Mendele Mocher Sforim, Sholem Aleichem, and I.L. Peretz are now seen as the basis for classic Yiddish fiction and are thereby highly influential in the Yiddishist movement.

==The Czernowitz Conference==

From 30th of August to 4th of September 1908, &quot;The Conference for the Yiddish Language&quot; () also known as &quot;The Czernowitz Conference&quot; () took place in the Austro-Hungarian city of Czernowitz, Bukovina (today in southwestern Ukraine). The conference proclaimed Yiddish a modern language with a developing high culture. The organizers of this gathering (Benno Straucher, Nathan Birnbaum, Chaim Zhitlowsky, David Pinski, and Jacob Gordin) expressed a sense of urgency to the delegates that Yiddish as a language and as the binding glue of Jews throughout Eastern Europe needed help. They proclaimed that the status of Yiddish reflected the status of the Jewish people. Thus only by saving the language could the Jews as a people be saved from the onslaught of assimilation. Before the conference, the plan created by the organizers had several topics that avoided political issues like the status of Yiddish. It included topics addressing the need for more Yiddish educators and educational systems, support for Yiddish press, theater, and literature, and changing the norm of young Jews choosing Hebrew or another non-Jewish language over Yiddish. Regardless of the extensive plan, the status of Yiddish almost immediately came up and took the majority of the conference’s time. Attendees questioned if Yiddish was only “a” national language of the Jewish people or if it was “the” national language. Eventually, the conference, for the first time in history declared Yiddish to be &quot;a national language of the Jewish people.&quot; Zionist activists were, however, not opposed to this decision; Yiddish was seen as the realistic choice of a language to organize the Jews of Eastern Europe for Jewish nationalism.

==Further developments==

=== YIVO ===
In 1925 YIVO (&quot;Yiddish Scientific Institute&quot;; : &quot;Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut&quot;) was established in Wilno, Poland (Vilnius, now part of Lithuania). YIVO was initially proposed by Yiddish linguist and writer Nochum Shtif (1879–1933). He characterized his advocacy of Yiddish as &quot;realistic&quot; Jewish nationalism, contrasted to the &quot;visionary&quot; Hebraists and the &quot;self-hating&quot; assimilationists who adopted Russian or Polish. YIVO’s work was largely secular in nature, reflecting its original members. The Division of Philology, which included Max Weinreich, standardized Yiddish orthography under YIVO. Simultaneously, the Division of History, originally headed by Elias Tcherikower, translated major works from Russian to Yiddish and conducted further research on historical topics.
=== Soviet Russia – The Bund ===

&quot;The Bund&quot; (&quot;The General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia&quot;; ), a secular Jewish socialist party in the Russian Empire, founded in Vilnius, Poland in 1897 and active through 1920, promoted the use of Yiddish as a Jewish national language, and to some extent opposed the Zionist project of reviving Hebrew. Moreover, beyond the Labour Bund group in Poland, the International Jewish Labor Bund regarded Yiddish as the Jewish national language.

In the Soviet Union during the 1920s, Yiddish was promoted as the language of the Jewish proletariat. It became one of the official languages in the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and in some of the Soviet republics, such as the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Galician Soviet Socialist Republic. A few of the republics included Yiddish public institutions like post offices and courts. A public educational system entirely based on the Yiddish language was established and comprised kindergartens, schools, and higher educational institutions. Advanced research institutions and Yiddish publishing houses began to open throughout the Soviet Union. At the same time, Hebrew was considered a bourgeois language and its use was generally discouraged. By the mid-1930s, Soviet rule forced scholars to work under intense restrictions. Soviet legislation dictated the content, vocabulary, and spelling of Yiddish scholarship. A few years later, in 1937, leading Yiddish writers and scholars were arrested and executed. Stalinist orders then gradually closed down the remaining publishing houses, research academies, and schools. Growing persecution of surviving Yiddish authors ultimately came to an end on August 12, 1952. Stalin ordered the execution of twenty-four prominent Yiddish scholars and artists in the Soviet Union all in a single night.

In 1928, the Soviet Union created the &quot;Jewish Autonomous Oblast&quot; (). Located in the Russian Far East and bordering China, its administrative center was the town of Birobidzhan. There, the Soviets envisaged setting up a new &quot;Soviet Zion&quot;, where a proletarian Jewish culture could be developed. Yiddish, rather than Hebrew, would be the national language. Although, concurrently, the Soviets made immigration to Birobidzhan very difficult. Ultimately, the vast majority of the Yiddish-language cultural institutions in the Soviet Union were closed in the late 1930s.

=== United States ===
As many Eastern European Jews began to emigrate to the United States, the movement became very active there, especially in New York City. One aspect of this became known as Yiddish Theatre, and involved authors such as Ben Hecht and Clifford Odets. 

Yiddish also became the language of Jewish labor and political movements in the US. The majority of the Yiddish-speaking political parties from the Pale of Settlement had equivalents in the United States. Notably, even the Zionist parties, like the North-American branch of Poalei-Zion, published much of their material in Yiddish rather than Hebrew. Further, at the beginning of the 20th century, American Jewish radicals also printed many political newspapers and other materials. These included the newspaper &quot;Forverts&quot;, which began as a socialist endeavor, and the &quot;Freie Arbeiter Stimme&quot; founded by anarchists.

The Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews that came to the US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were also often underpaid and overworked in unsafe conditions, resulting in the creation of many Jewish unions. Notably, the United Hebrew Trades was a collective of labor unions founded in 1888, eventually representing over 250,000 members. Forverts, and other leftist Yiddishist newspapers, were instrumental in organizing and recruiting for these organizations.

Owing in a large part to the efforts of the Yiddishist movement, Yiddish, before World War II, was becoming a major language, spoken by over 11,000,000 people.

=== Contemporary Yiddishism ===
The Holocaust, however, led to a large decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive European Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life were largely destroyed. Around 5 million, or 85%, of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, were speakers of Yiddish. 

Additionally, the revival of the Hebrew language as the national language of Israel, created a significant decline in the use of Yiddish in the daily Jewish life. To some, Yiddish was seen as the language of the Jewish people in diaspora and believed its use should be extinguished in the early establishment of Israel. Di Goldene Keyt was a literary journal started by Avrom Sutzkever in 1949 in an attempt to bridge the gap between Yiddish and Hebrew literature. In this journal, Yiddish and Hebrew poems and pieces of literature were published but much of Sutzkever’s work went unrecognized until the 1980s because of the fierce rivalry between Hebraists and Yiddishists.

However, Yiddish did not become a completely “dead” language after the Holocaust. In the mid 20th century there was the establishment of the Yungntruf, a movement for young Yiddish speakers which still continues today. The Yungntruf movement also created the Yiddish Farm in 2012, a farm in New York which offers an immersive education for students to learn and speak in Yiddish. The use of Yiddish is also now offered as a language on Duolingo, used throughout the social media platforms of Jews, and is offered as a language in schools, on an international scale. Particularly in the United States, the use of Yiddish has become a part of the identity of young Jewish Americans ranging from queer to orthodox individuals.

Additionally, the decline of secular Yiddish education after the Holocaust encouraged the creation of summer programs and university courses at more than 50 institutions catered to Yiddish learning. Scholars including Uriel Weinreich, Mordkhe Schaechter, and Marvin Herzog were especially influential in establishing American academic Yiddish programs.

<doc id="1141373" wikidata="Q187713" url="?curid=1141373" title="Roberto Roena">
<text>Roberto Roena Vázquez (January 16, 1940 – September 23, 2021) was a Puerto Rican salsa music percussionist, orchestra leader, and dancer. Roena was one of the original members of Cortijo y su combo and later with El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico. He later became the leader of his own band, &quot;Roberto Roena y Su Apollo Sound&quot;, widely considered one of the best Latin salsa bands in Puerto Rico. Roena had also been a long-time member of the Fania All Stars, a salsa supergroup that has enjoyed worldwide success since the 1970s.

== Early career ==

Born in the Dulces Labios neighborhood of Mayagüez, Roena took his first steps in the art of dance by staging dance routines with his brother Cuqui at his hometown. When Roberto was nine years old, his family settled in Santurce, where the brothers continued to refine their mambo and cha-cha-chá routines, delighting their public in talent contests. This led to their contract of weekly performances on the television program “La Taberna India” on WKAQ-TV. During the broadcasts, percussionist Rafael Cortijo saw Roena in action. Roena, aside from being a dancer, was a talented at playing percussion conga drum. Rafael Cortijo took him under his wing and taught him how to play bongos, later to become the bongo player for his band. He also played occasional baseball.

== Cortijo y Su Combo ==
When Roberto was 16 years old, Cortijo was in need of a bongo player for a group that he was forming. Visualizing a bongo player that could dance and play the cowbell at the same time, Cortijo recruited Roberto to join his new band, and personally taught Roberto how to play both instruments. The group&#x27;s name derived from the name of an existing band named &quot;El Combo&quot; in which many of the original band members had been involved. For seven years, Roena was part of Cortijo’s group and his Combo, with Ismael Rivera as vocalist. With that lineup, they toured the major stages of the United States, Europe, and South America. , mostly made up of Afro–Puerto Ricans, was the first of its kind to succeed in gaining access to the stages where only white artists were performing, within and outside of Puerto Rico.

== El Gran Combo ==
The Combo’s good fortune ended with the arrest of its star singer, Ismael Rivera, for charges of drug possession. With the absence of “El Sonero Mayor,” Cortijo’s musicians discussed the possibility of remaining together. Some members of the group chose to distance themselves from their imprisoned lead singer, and &quot;El Gran Combo&quot; was born. Out of gratitude and loyalty to Rafael Cortijo, his mentor, Roena did not join the new Combo immediately. Eventually Cortijo left for New York in search of new musicians, and after nine months, Roberto, who had stayed in Puerto Rico, decided to join &quot;El Gran Combo&quot; which was then led by pianist Rafael Ithier.

El Gran Combo became the new sensation in Latin music, and Roena was part of the group until 1969. Wanting to establish his own salsa orchestra, Roberto formed “Los Megatones” in 1967, playing Latin Jazz Wednesday nights at a local club. Two years after forming &quot;Los Megatones&quot;, as a result of personal differences with Andy Montañez, one of &quot;El Gran Combo&#x27;s&quot; vocalists, Roberto left &quot;El Gran Combo&quot;.

In 1969, he went on to form a band by the name of &quot;Roberto Roena y Su Apollo Sound&quot;, arguably one of the best Latin salsa bands in Puerto Rico. Roberto Roena’s new orchestra was baptized &quot;El Apollo Sound&quot; because the launch of NASA&#x27;s Apollo 11 lunar mission coincided with the day of the band’s first rehearsal. The band eventually recorded hits such as &quot;Y Tu Loco Loco&quot;, &quot;Traicion&quot;, &quot;Que Se Sepa&quot; and &quot;Herencia Rumbero&quot;.

Roberto Roena was also a long-time member of the Fania All Stars, the showcase group for the Fania Records label, which has enjoyed worldwide success since the 1970s. He recorded his signature song, &quot;Coro Miyare&quot;, with the group; live performances of the song featured Roena playing the bongos and dancing with his uncle, legendary salsa dancer Aníbal Vázquez, in a choreographed section that almost always received standing ovations from the audience.

Mr. Roena took a giant step in the fusion of salsa with jazz, in the 1970s, by joining forces with African superstar (saxophonist) Manu Dibango of &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; fame.

Even without knowing how to read or write music, and probably because of it, Roena knew how to surround himself with excellent musicians and arrangers. &quot;Apollo Sound&quot; featured musicians from the ensemble of Tito Puente, &quot;Cortijo y Su Combo&quot;, &quot;El Gran Combo&quot; and &quot;Los Sunsets&quot;, among others. Some of the well renowned arrangers and composers who nourished his repertoire were Mario Ortiz, Bobby Valentín, Elias Lopés, Luis “Perico” Ortiz and Papo Lucca. With &quot;Apollo Sound&quot;, Roberto introduced a “new” sound to salsa music by utilizing two trumpets, a trombone and a saxophone, a combination he took from the influence of the wind section of the rock group Blood, Sweat and Tears (in honor of which his band recorded a successful version of “Spinning Wheel”).

Roberto always considered variety as the key to success, leading him to include in his musical repertoire everything from go-go to the romantic, the same in English as in Spanish. Roberto Roena and his Apollo Sound’s first album produced hits of great impact like “Tú loco loco y yo tranquilo,” “El escapulario,” and “El sordo.” In fact, it was Apollo Sound who popularized the Bobby Capó classic, “Soñando con Puerto Rico.”

Apollo Sound recorded under the label International Records (a subsidiary of Fania) for a decade, in which they harvested successes like “Traición,” “Chotorro,” “Mi Desengaño,” “Fea,” “Marejada feliz,” “Cui cui,” and “El progreso,” among others. His popularity on the radio waves accompanied tours around the United States and Latin America.

Complementing the musicality of the salsa group was always the showmanship inherent in Roberto Roena. Dying his hair in new colors, playing percussion in his underwear and sporting a harness so he could “fly” around the stage of New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden were some of the tricks that he used to stand out among the other groups in vogue. In fact, a noted journalist that followed Apollo Sound once remarked that they were “the first group in Puerto Rico with a system of psychedelic lights and go-go girls.”

Beginning in the 1980s, Roberto Roena and his Apollo Sound experienced a fade in popularity, reflecting a crisis that was sweeping through the salsa movement in general. Nevertheless, Roberto maintained himself by collaborating and recording independently with local groups. In 1990, Roena tried to revive the concept of Apollo Sound. He opened a concert for British rock singer Sting at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente, where he presented his hit salsa version of &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; (with an amused Sting watching from the sidelines).

In 1994, he celebrated 25 years with his orchestra in a successful concert at the Centro de Bellas Artes in San Juan. This performance was recorded and released, validating his music for a new generation.

Roena was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Personal life==
Roena was born in barrio Dulces Labios in Mayagüez on January 16, 1940. His parents were Raquel María Vázquez Plaza and Francisco Roena. Roena had two daughters, Brenda and Gladys and two sons, Ivan and Francisco. Roena died in a hospital in Carolina, Puerto Rico on September 23, 2021, after suffering a heart attack. He was buried at Monte Calvario Cemetery in Caguas, Puerto Rico

<doc id="1141374" wikidata="Q458362" url="?curid=1141374" title="History of Hungary before the Hungarian conquest">
<text>The [[history of Hungary]] before the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]] spans the time period before the Hungarian conquest in the 9th century of the territories that would become the Principality of Hungary and the Kingdom of Hungary.

The first known traces belong to the Homo heidelbergensis, with scarce or nonexistent evidence of human presence until the Neanderthals around 100,000 years ago. Anatomically modern humans arrived at the Carpathian Basin before and belonged to the Aurignacian group. The rest of the Stone Age is marked by minimal or not-yet-processed archeological evidence, with the exception of the Linear Pottery culture—the &quot;garden type civilization&quot; that introduced agriculture to the Carpathian Basin.

During the Copper and Bronze Ages, three significant groups were the Baden, the Makó and the Ottomány (to not be confused with Ottoman Turks) cultures. The major improvement was obviously metalworking, but the Baden culture also brought about cremation and even long-distance trade with remote areas such as the Baltic or Iran. Turbulent changes during the late Bronze Age gave an end to the native, relatively advanced civilization, and the beginning of the Iron Age saw mass immigration of Indo-European nomads believed to be of ancient Iranian ancestry. However, as the time went on, the Carpathian Basin attracted immigration from all directions: the Hallstatt Celts from the west were the first and most influential at around 750 BC, the mysterious Sigynnae around 500 BC, the Pannonians—an Illyrian tribe gave the future Roman province its name, while the very east became occupied by other Thracian, Iranian, and later Celtic tribes. Before 100 BC, most of the area was occupied by various Celtic or celticized people, such as the successor of the Halstatt culture, the Taurisci, the Boii, and the Pannonians.

The Roman era began with several attacks between 156 and 70 BC, but their gradual conquest was interrupted by the Dacian king Burebista, whose kingdom stretched as far as today&#x27;s Slovakia at its greatest extent. However, the period of Dacian dominance did not last long, and by 9 BC the Romans had subjugated the entire area and made it into the Pannonia subprovince of province Illyricum and eventually Pannonia province. Under Roman rule, many contemporary cities such as Buda, Győr and Sopron were founded and the population romanized, and culture as a whole flourished. Roman emperors sometimes tolerated other tribes settling in the territory, such as the Iazyges or Vandals. Christianity spread during the 4th century, when it became the state religion.

In the first years of the Age of Migration, the Carpathian Basin was settled by the Huns who by 430 had established a vast, if short-lived, dominion in Europe centered in the basin. Numerous Germanic tribes lived alongside them such as the Goths, Marcomanni, Quadi or Gepidi, the last of which stayed the longest and whose peoples incorporated into the Hunnic Empire. The next wave of migration during the 6th century saw other Germanic tribes, the Lombards and Heruli overpower the Gepidi, only to be ousted by another major nomadic tribe, the Avars. Like the Huns, the Avars established an empire there and posed a significant threat to their neighbours but were eventually defeated by both neighbouring states and internal strife (around 800). However, Avar population remained quite steady until the Hungarian conquest. The territory became divided between East Francia and First Bulgarian Empire with the northeastern part under Moravian Slavic Principality of Nitra. This state lasted until the arrival of the Magyar tribes in the late 9th century.

==Prehistory==

=== Stone Age ===

==== Vértesszőlős, &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; ====

The oldest archaeological site which yielded evidence of human presence—human bones, pebble tools and kitchen refuse—in the Carpathian Basin was excavated at Vértesszőlős in Transdanubia in the 1960s. The Middle Pleistocene site was situated in calcareous tuff basins with a diameter of that the nearby warm springs had formed. The site at Vértesszőlős was occupied five times between about 500,000 and 250,000 years ago.The occipital bone of an adult male &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;, who is now known as &quot;Samu&quot;, and a child&#x27;s milk tooth were found. Tools of quartzite and silex pebbles collected at the nearby river were also found, as well as a fireplace with hearths made from crushed animal bones, with remains of wild horses, aurochs, bisons, red deer, deer, wolves, bears, and saber-toothed cats.

==== Gap in the records ====
There is a gap in the archaeological record, with no evidence of human presence between about 250,000 to 100,000 years ago. 

==== Middle Palaeolithic, Neanderthals ====
The earliest Middle Palaeolithic sites are dated to the transitory period between the Riss and Würm glacial periods around 100,000 years ago. Remains of skulls show that Neanderthals inhabited northeastern Transdanubia and the Bükk Mountains during this period. The Neanderthals who lived in the region of Érd between around 100,000 and 40,000 BC used quartzite pebbles. They led hunting expeditions as far as the Gerecse Hills for cave bears, wild horses, woolly rhinoceros and other animals. A Neanderthal community settled near the hot-water springs at Tata around 50,000 BC. They hunted mammoth calves, brown bear, wild horses and reed deer. A flat oval object made from mammoth tooth lamella, similar to the Indigenous Australians&#x27; ritual &quot;tjurunga&quot;, was found at the site. A third group of Neanderthals settled in the caves of the Pilis, Vértes and Gerecse Hills. They regularly visited the Bükk Mountains and the White Carpathians to collect raw material for their tools. Ibex was the main prey of the Neanderthals of the Middle Palaeolothic sites in the Bükk Mountains. In addition to local stone, they used raw material from the White Carpathians and the region of the river Prut. Archaeological research suggest that the Neanderthals disappeared from the northern regions of the Carpathian Basin around 40,000 years ago.

==== Istállóskő Cave, Aurignacian group ====
Latest research shows that the first communities of anatomically modern humans came to the Carpathian Basin between . Consequently, the cohabitation of the Neanderthals and modern humans in the territory, which was assumed by earlier scholarship, cannot be proved. The Aurignacian group of modern humans who settled in the Istállóskő Cave primarily used tools made of bones and used the cave as a seasonal camping site during their hunts for chamois, red deer, reindeer and other local animals. Their tools made of stone suggest that they came to the Bükk Mountains from the northern Carpathians and the region of the Prut. 

==== Szelete culture ====
According to a scholarly view, a local archaeological culture—the &quot;Szeleta culture&quot;—can be distinguished, which represents a transition between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic and was featured by leaf-shaped spearheads from around . However, the existence of a distinct archaeological culture is not unanimously accepted by specialists, because most prehistoric tools from the eponymous Szeleta Cave (in the eastern side of the Bükk) are similar to those found in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of Central Europe.

==== Gravettian hunters ====
Attracted by the rich fauna of the lowlands in the centre of the Carpathian Basin, groups of &quot;Gravettian&quot; hunters penetrated into the territory from the west about 27,000 years ago. The central grasslands were not covered by ice even at the maximum of the last glaciation (around 20,000 years ago). The new arrivals settled on hilltops along the rivers Hornád and Bodrog. They primarily hunted mammoth and elk and used stone blades to work skin, bone, antler and wood. Artistic finds are rare; for instance, a disc with serrated edges, which was made of polished limestone, was found at Bodrogkeresztúr. A second wave of &quot;Gravettians&quot; arrived during the warmer period that began about 20,000 years ago. They primarily made their tools from pebbles, similar to Lower Palaeolithic communities, but no continuity between the two groups can be detected. The remains of semi-sunken huts were excavated at a site on a hilltop near Sárvár where reindeer bones were also found. The site also yielded a perforated (but not decorated) reindeer antler. In addition to permanent settlements, the Gravettian hunters&#x27; temporary camps were unearthed in the plains of the Jászság and around Szeged. About 15,000 years ago, new hunters came to the territory; their best-known settlements were situated in northeastern Transdanubia. A pendant made of wolf tooth, a pair of red deer teeth and similar finds suggest that these hunters wore ornaments.

=== Mesolitic Age ===
Mesolithic sites are rare but start to appear after systematic surveys, especially in the Jászság area. 

==== Tardenoisian culture, 9000–4000 BC ====
The Tardenoisian (or Beuronian) is an archaeological culture of the Mesolithic/Epipaleolithic period from northern France and Belgium. Similar cultures are known further east in Central Europe, parts of Britain and west across Spain, extending possibly to the nowadays North-Western Hungary. 

==== Starčevo culturem 6200–4500 BC ====
The Starčevo culture is an archaeological culture of Southeastern Europe, dating to the Neolithic period between &quot;c.&quot; 6200 and 4500 BCE. It originates in the spread of the Neolithic package of peoples and technological innovations including farming and ceramics from Anatolia to the area of Sesklo. The Starčevo culture marks its spread to the inland Balkan peninsula as the Cardial ware culture did along the Adriatic coastline. It forms part of the wider Starčevo–Körös–Criş culture which gave rise to the central European Linear Pottery culture c. 700 years after the initial spread of Neolithic farmers towards the northern Balkans.

==== Criş-Körös culture, ~6200 BC ====
Neolithic settlement begins with the Criş-Körös culture, carbon-dated to around 6200 BC. 

==== Linear Pottery, 5500–4500 BC ====
In the Middle Neolithic, the Western Linear Pottery culture in Transdanubia and the Satu-Mare (Szatmar) and Eastern Linear pottery (called &quot;Alföld Linear Pottery&quot; in Hungary) in the east, developed into Želiezovce (Slovakia) and Szakálhát and Bükk, respectively. 

==== Vinča culture ~5400–4500 BC ====
Farming technology first introduced to the region during the First Temperate Neolithic was developed further by the Vinča culture. It was noted for dark-burnished pottery, and fuelling a population boom and producing some of the largest settlements in prehistoric Europe.

==== Tisza culture, ~5400–4500 BC ====
The Tisza culture is a Neolithic archaeological culture of the Alföld plain in modern-day Hungary, Western Romania, Eastern Slovakia, and Ukrainian Zakarpattia Oblast in Central Europe. The culture is dated to between 5400 BCE and 4500/4400 BCE. 

==== Tiszapolgár culture 4500–4000 BC ====
The Late Neolithic Tisza culture was followed by the Eneolithic Tiszapolgár and Bodrogkeresztúr cultures. These cultures were part of the broader cultural complex known as Old Europe or the Danube civilization.

==== Bodrogkeresztúr culture 4000 to 3600 BC. ====
The Bodrogkeresztúr culture is best known for its seventy cemeteries. Which show clear genetic links with the preceding Tiszapolgár culture. Bodrogkeresztúr cemetieres make clear distinctions between males and females.

==== Sopot culture, ~5000 BC ====
The Sopot culture is a neolithic archaeological culture that was first identified in eastern Slavonia in modern-day Croatia, and was since also found in several sites in Hungary.

==== Baden Culture, 3600–2800 BC ====
The Baden culture was a Copper Age (Chalcolithic) archaeological culture found in Central Europe. In Hungarian and Slovakian sites, cremated human remains were often placed in anthropomorphic urns, whereas in Nitriansky Hrádok, a mass grave has been found. The only known cemetery with individual graves was found in an early Baden (&quot;Boleráz phase&quot;) site is Pilismarót, in Komárom-Esztergom County, which also contained a few examples of goods possibly exported from the Stroke-ornamented ware culture (centred in what is now Poland). The Baden culture is claimed by some scholars to have been an early example of an Indo-European culture in Central Europe.

===Bronze Age===
Makó (a town in modern Csongrád County) lends its name to a 3rd millennium BCE material culture (also known as the Makó-Caka or Kosihy-Caka culture) and other archaeological finds from the Copper/Bronze Ages. There are more than 180 registered archaeological sites around Makó, the most important of which are at Kiszombor. The Makó culture is often regarded as a subset or offshoot of the broader Vučedol culture, centred on Vukovar). While there is no consensus on the cultural affiliations of the Makó sites, kurgans, buckles, jewelry and equestrian equipment found near Makó may suggest links to nomads migrating from the Eurasian steppe. In later phases, these sites contain very large numbers of objects associated with the Sarmatians.

The Ottomány culture (also known as the Otomani-Füzesabony culture) was a Bronze Age culture (circa 2100–1400 BC) stretching from eastern Hungary and western Romania to southeast Poland and western Ukraine. Amber exported on prehistoric trade routes from the Baltic is often found at Ottomány sites and the people of this culture appear to have held a central part of the so-called &quot;Amber Road&quot;, which connected the powerful and rising ancient Mediterranean states to the south-eastern Baltic region. The Ottomány culture was succeeded by the Tumulus culture and Urnfield culture.

===Iron Age===

In the Carpathian Basin, the Iron Age commenced around 800 BC, when a new population moved into the territory and took possession of the former population&#x27;s centers fortified by earthworks. The new population may have consisted of ancient Iranian tribes that had seceded from the federation of the tribes living under the suzerainty of the Cimmerians. They were equestrian nomads and formed the people of the Mezőcsát culture who used tools and weapons made of iron. They extended their rule over what are now the Great Hungarian Plain and the eastern parts of Transdanubia.

Around 750 BC, people of the Hallstatt culture gradually occupied the western parts of Transdanubia, but the earlier population of the territory also survived and thus the two archaeological cultures existed together for centuries. The people of the Hallstatt culture took over the former population&#x27;s fortifications (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in Velem, Celldömölk, Tihany) but they also built new ones enclosed with earthworks (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in Sopron). The nobility were buried in chamber tombs covered by earth. Some of their settlements situated along the Amber Road developed into commercial centers.

The classic Scythian culture spread across the Great Hungarian Plain between the 7th–6th century BC.

Between 550 and 500 BC, new people settled along the river Tisza and in Transylvania. Their immigration may have been connected either to the military campaigns of king Darius I of Persia (522 BC – 486 BC) on the Balkan Peninsula or to the struggles between the Cimmerians and the Scythians. Those people, who settled down in Transylvania and in the Banat, may be identified with the Agathyrsi (probably an ancient Thracian tribe whose presence on the territory was recorded by Herodotus); while those who lived in what is now the Great Hungarian Plain may be identified with the Sigynnae. The new population introduced the use of the potter&#x27;s wheel in the Carpathian Basin and they maintained close commercial contacts with the neighboring peoples.

The Pannonians (an Illyrian tribe) may have moved to the southern territories of Transdanubia in the course of the 5th century BC.

In the 4th century BC, Celtic tribes immigrated to the territories around the river Rába and defeated the Illyrian people who had been living there, but the Illyrians managed to assimilate the Celts, who adopted their language. In the 290s and 280s BC, the Celtic people who were migrating towards the Balkan Peninsula passed through Transdanubia but some of the tribes settled on the territory. Following 279 BC, the Scordisci (a Celtic tribe), who had been defeated at Delphi, settled at the confluence of the rivers Sava and Danube and they extended their rule over the southern parts of Transdanubia. Around that time, the northern parts of Transdanubia were ruled by the Taurisci (also a Celtic tribe) and by 230 BC, Celtic people (the people of the La Tène culture) had occupied gradually the whole territory of the Great Hungarian Plain. Between 150 and 100 BC, a new Celtic tribe, the Boii moved to the Carpathian Basin and they occupied the northern and northeastern parts of the territory (mainly the territory of present Slovakia).

==Roman era==
The Romans commenced their military raids in the Carpathian Basin in 156 BC when they attacked the Scordisci living in the Transdanubian region. In 119 BC, they marched against Siscia (today Sisak in Croatia) and strengthened their rule over the future Illyricum province south of the Carpathian Basin. In 88 BC, the Romans defeated the Scordisci whose rule was driven back to the eastern parts of Syrmia, while the Pannonians moved to the northern parts of Transdanubia. When King Mithridates VI of Pontus made plans to attack the Romans by way of the Balkan Peninsula, he referred to the Pannonic tribes, and not to the Scordisci, as masters of the region on his path; it appears, therefore, that around 70–60 BC, the Pannonic tribes were no longer subjugated.

Around 50 BC, the mainly Celtic tribes living on the territory were confronted by Burebista, king of the Dacians (82–44 BC), who began suddenly to expand his domain centered in Transylvania. The sources do not indicate clearly whether Burebista was the original unifier of the Dacian tribes, or whether his efforts at unification built upon the work of his predecessors. Burebista subjugated the Taurisci and the Anarti; in the process, he confronted the Celtic tribal alliance led by the Boii. Burebista&#x27;s victory over the Celts led not only to the breakup of their tribal alliance, but also to the establishment of Dacian settlements in the southern parts of today&#x27;s Slovakia. Burebista, however, fell victim to his political enemies, and his domain was divided into four parts.

The period between 15 BC and 9 AD was characterized by the continuous uprisings of the Pannonians against the emerging power of the Roman Empire. The Romans, however, could strengthen their supremacy over the rebellious tribes and they organised the occupied territory into a new province.

===Pannonia province===
The Roman Empire subdued the Pannonians, Dacians, Celts and other peoples in this territory. The territory west of the Danube was conquered by the Roman Empire between 35 and 9 BC, and became a province of the Roman Empire under the name of Pannonia. The easternmost parts of present-day Hungary were later (106 AD) organized as the Roman province of Dacia (lasting until 271). The territory between the Danube and the Tisza was inhabited by the Sarmatian Iazyges between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, or even earlier (earliest remains have been dated to 80 BC). Roman Emperor Trajan officially allowed the Iazyges to settle there as confederates. The remaining territory was in Thracian (Dacian) hands. In addition, the Vandals settled on the upper Tisza in the second half of the 2nd century AD.

Like in the other provinces, in Pannonia, the material culture of the native population showed little sign of Romanization in the first 160 years of Roman rule.

The four centuries of Roman rule created an advanced and flourishing civilization. Many of the important cities of today&#x27;s Hungary were founded during this period, such as Aquincum (Budapest), Sopianae (Pécs), Arrabona (Győr), Solva (Esztergom), Savaria (Szombathely) and Scarbantia (Sopron). Christianity spread in Pannonia in the 4th century, when it became the empire&#x27;s official religion.

==Migration period==

In 375 AD, the nomadic Huns began invading Europe from the eastern steppes, instigating the Great Age of Migrations. In 380, the Huns penetrated into present-day Hungary, and remained an important factor in the region well into the 5th century.

Around the same time (379–395), the Roman Empire allowed the groups of Goths, Alans, Huns, Marcomanni and Quadi to settle Pannonia, which still was a Roman territory. The Visigoths, Alans, Vandals and most of the Quadi and Marcomanni, however, left this territory around 400, and moved on to western and southern Europe.

The Pannonian provinces suffered from the Migration Period from 379 onwards, the settlement of the Goth-Alan-Hun ally caused repeated serious crises and devastations, the contemporaries described it as a state of siege, Pannonia became an invasion corridor both in the north and in the south. The flight and emigration of the Romans began after two hard decades in 401, this also caused a recession in secular and ecclesiastical life. The Hun control gradually expanded over Pannonia from 410, finally the Roman Empire ratified the cession of Pannonia by treaty in 433. The flight and emigration of the Romans from Pannonia continued without interruption until the invasion of the Avars. András Mócsy assumes that the largest Roman emigration was the earliest and the 5th and 6th centuries were a phase of gradual emigration.

Bishop Amantius fled around 400 to Aquileia. The emigrating Romans tooks several Christian relics and remains of Pannonian martyrs with them to Rome and to several other towns of Italy. Around 400, the inhabitants of Scarbantia (now Sopron in Hungary) fled from the invasion of the barbarians &quot;incursio barbarorum&quot; to Italy, and took the relics of Quirinus, the martyr bishop of Sescia (now Sisak in Croatia), from Savaria (now Szombathely in Hungary) with them. These events signified the decay of the Christian communities in Pannonia.

The Huns, taking advantage of the departure of the Goths, Quadi, &quot;et al.&quot;, created a significant empire in 423 based in Hungary. In 453 they reached the height of their expansion under the well-known conqueror, Attila the Hun. The empire collapsed in 455, when the Huns were defeated by the neighbouring Germanic tribes (such as the Quadi, Gepidi and Sciri).

The Gepidi (having lived to the east of the upper Tisza river since 260 AD) then moved into the eastern Carpathian Basin in 455. They ceased to exist in 567 when they were defeated by the Lombards and Avars (see below).

The Germanic Ostrogoths inhabited Pannonia, with Rome&#x27;s consent, between 456 and 471.

=== After the Romans ===

Roman influence in Pannonia had begun to decline as early as the arrival of the Huns in the 4th century. 

According to András Mócsy, it is not possible to prove whether the reconstruction of a church is to be attributed to barbarians or to remained Romans at the majority of places. The usage of Christian cult-buildings after the 4th century does not prove the survival of the Pannonian cult-communities because the Goths and other peoples were Arian Christians and they continued to use the dilapidated churches, however so far (1974) this usage can be proved only at the &quot;Basilica II&quot; in the large fortified center at Fenékpuszta (part of Keszthely in Hungary). The Keszthely culture is a special archaeological composition of the early Avar period which cannot be traced back to the local culture of the Roman period. However, based on the excavations of Fenékpuszta, a group of finds such as a gold pin with the name BONOSA proving that some ethnic group of Romans remained there. There are examples of sporadic Romans who had stayed behind in the 5th century, Saint Anthony the Hermit was born in Pannonia Valeria and as an orphaned child he was sent to his uncle, Constantius, the Bishop of Lorsch in today Germany. Later, Saint Leonianus travelled to Gaul from Savaria (now Szombathely in Hungary), Saint Martin of Braga emigrated from Pannonia to Hispania. The Lombards also took Romans along with them to Italy. The last emigration was the Syrmians to Salona to the today Croatian cost in the beginning of the 7th century.

Later, Christian barbarians who migrated to the northern part of Lake Balaton established the Keszthely Culture, which disappeared by the middle of the 7th century.

The first Slavs came to the region, almost certainly from the north, soon after the departure of the Ostrogoths (471 AD), together with the Lombards and Herulis. Around 530, the Germanic Lombards settled in Pannonia. They had to fight against the Gepidi and the Slavs. In 568, pushed out by the Avars, they moved into northern Italy.

The nomadic Avars arrived from Asia in the 560s, utterly destroyed the Gepidi in the east, drove away the Lombards in the west, and subjugated the Slavs, partly assimilating them. The Avars established a large empire, just as the Huns had decades prior. This empire was destroyed around 800 by Frankish and Bulgar attacks, and above all by internal feuds, however Avar population remained in numbers until the arrival of Árpád&#x27;s Magyars. From 800, the whole area of Pannonian Basin was under control between two powers (East Francia and First Bulgarian Empire). Around 800, northeastern Hungary became part of the Slavic Principality of Nitra, which then became part of Great Moravia in 833.

Also, after 800, southeastern Hungary was conquered by Bulgaria. Western Hungary (Pannonia) was a tributary to the Franks. In 839 the Slavic Balaton Principality was founded in southwestern Hungary (under Frank suzerainty). During the reign of Svatopluk I northwestern Hungary was conquered by Great Moravia. Pannonia remained under Frankish control until the Hungarian Conquest.

<text>Israir Airlines Ltd., more commonly referred to as Israir, is an Israeli low-cost airline headquartered in Tel Aviv. It operates domestic scheduled and air taxi flights from Ben Gurion International Airport, Ramon Airport, and Haifa Airport as well as scheduled and charter international services from Ben Gurion International Airport to Europe and Asia. It also operates VIP flights, and is Israel&#x27;s second-largest airline after El Al, surpassing Arkia Israel Airlines during the Coronavirus pandemic, employing some 350 staff.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===

Israir Airlines was established in 1989 as Kanfei HaEmek (Valley Wings) before changing its name to Israir Airlines in 1996. It is now wholly owned by the Rami Levi Group. The airline began with domestic services from Eilat Airport, Ben Gurion International Airport, Sde Dov Airport, and Haifa Airport in the north of the country. It expanded its operations to begin international charter flights in 1999, building up a route network that now covers much of Europe, as well as regularly flying to other destinations in Asia, Africa, and North America. The airline is said to have modeled itself on US low-cost carrier JetBlue.

The airline expanded operations across the Atlantic Ocean when regular charter service to New York City&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport was started in June 2004. Permission was granted to the airline to convert this to regular scheduled service by the Israeli government and the FAA on May 1, 2006. This service was discontinued in September 2008, due to escalating fuel prices and the expectation of a drop in the number of passengers due to the weakness of the dollar at the time. After Israir was granted permission to operate scheduled service on the lucrative New York-Tel Aviv route, it also entered talks with both Boeing and Airbus regarding the acquisition of new aircraft to its fleet and replacement of its existing jets. The company was said to be in talks with Airbus over the A350 model. It also signed a deal to acquire Airbus A320 aircraft. This was a significant milestone in Israeli aviation, as no airline had ever before purchased Airbus aircraft. In April 2008, the airline received an Airbus A330 for its New York flights to replace the Boeing 767 aircraft it had previously been wet-leasing. Israir however meanwhile no longer flies to New York and has since phased out all long-haul aircraft.

In early 2007, the airline announced plans to introduce &quot;Sky-Torah&quot; scrolls on each of its aircraft. These were effectively Torah scrolls which would be carried on board its flight for Jewish passengers to use for prayer. This is a first for any Israeli airline and was seen by many as a means to attract many Haredi passengers to the airline at a time when they were showing great dissatisfaction with arch-rival, El Al, following their flying of aircraft on the Shabbat. Later on in 2007, an Israir passenger announced he was filing a lawsuit against the airline for misadvertising the legroom they offered on their aircraft.

In early 2008, when restrictions were lifted on Israeli airlines&#x27; destinations, Israir applied for designated carrier status on routes from Israel to London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Amsterdam, Rome, Budapest, Las Vegas, and Miami – some of which were destinations served by the airline as charter routes back then.

===Developments since 2010===

Israir received the first of the two ATR 72 aircraft it had on order in early July 2011 to replace the ATR 42, with the second one expected to follow later that month. In 2014, the airline posted losses of 18.4 million shekel. On 25 May 2015, an Israir Airbus A320-200 has been seized by Portuguese authorities while in Lisbon over unpaid debts to Portuguese airline euroAtlantic Airways for a leasing contract in 2008. Also in May 2015, El Al confirmed it was in talks to merge its subsidiary Sun D&#x27;Or into Israir. While Sun D&#x27;Or would be dissolved, El Al would gain shares in Israir instead.

In October 2020, it was announced that the company is being auctioned off, the bids need to be submitted by November 8. On October 4, the first bid was submitted by Rami Levy and Shalom Haim through BGI Investments. On October 13, Dubai-based NY Koen Group, headed by Naum Koen, has announced its intention to participate in the auction.

== Fleet ==

As of February 2025, the Israir fleet consists of the following aircraft:

== Incidents and accidents ==
* In June 2001, one of Israir&#x27;s ATR 42-320 aircraft was damaged beyond repair following a heavy landing at Ben Gurion Airport. Despite the aircraft being written off, no passengers were injured in this incident.
* On July 6, 2005 a fully loaded Israir 767 accidentally taxied onto an active runway at JFK, and a Douglas DC-8 cargo aircraft narrowly avoided collision by taking off at full throttle above them, with only 45 feet of clearance over the 767.
* In May 2007, an Israir aircraft on a test flight was almost shot down by Israeli F-16 jets after it entered a demarcation zone where airlines are expected to identify themselves.
* Later that month, on May 23, an Israir flight had to make an emergency landing following smoke build up in the cabin on approach at Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport. No one was injured in the incident.
* In July 2008, an Israir aircraft flew from Eilat Airport to Ben Gurion International Airport with a small hole in its frame. The hole was discovered by mechanics at Ben Gurion and there is an ongoing probe as to whether or not Israir knew of the hole, which, as it turns out, was caused by Israir workers in Eilat when they crashed a mobile staircase into the aircraft&#x27;s body. The plane was scheduled to fly to Italy from Tel Aviv, and at an altitude of over 10,000 meters, the plane would most likely have experienced a decompression.
* In January 2025, an Israir aircraft that was meant to fly from Tel Aviv to London declared an emergency and returned to Ben Gurion International Airport after flying in circles for three hours to burn fuel before landing.

The island is a barren outcrop of bedrock, with a permanent size of half an acre rising to only three feet above sea level, plus an intertidal zone of a further . Access is by private boat only.

The source of its current name has a hazy history. On a 1775, London chart, this island was labeled Hayman&#x27;s Island and shows a greater area than presently exists. There is no historical evidence that this island was used as a location for hanging criminals. During the American Civil War, targets were placed on the island for artillery practice for troops training at Camp Adams. In 1882, several fishermen built fishing shacks on Hangman Island and were reported to have cultivated a vegetable garden among the rocks.

<text>The Canis Major Overdensity (&quot;CMa Overdensity&quot;) or Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy (&quot;CMa Dwarf&quot;) is a disputed dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group, located in the same part of the sky as the constellation Canis Major.

The supposed small galaxy contains a relatively high percentage of red giants and is thought to contain an estimated one billion stars in all.

At the time of its announcement, the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy was classified as an irregular galaxy and was thought to be the closest neighboring galaxy to the Earth&#x27;s location in the Milky Way, located about away from the Solar System and from the Galactic Center. It has a roughly elliptical shape and is thought to contain as many stars as the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, the previous contender for closest galaxy to Earth, though later studies disputed this conclusion.

==Discovery==

The existence of a strong elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity was reported in November 2003 by an international team of French, Italian, British, and Australian astronomers, who claimed their study pointed to a newly discovered dwarf galaxy: the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy. This structure is located closer to the Sun than the center of this galaxy, at approximately from the Sun.

The team of astronomers that discovered it was collaborating on analysis of data from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), a comprehensive survey of the sky in infrared light, which is not blocked by gas and dust as severely as visible light. Because of this technique, scientists were able to detect a very significant overdensity of class M giant stars in a part of the sky occupied by the Canis Major constellation, along with several other related structures composed of this type of star, two of which form broad, faint arcs.

==Characteristics==

Some astronomers believe that the CMa overdensity is a dwarf galaxy in the process of being pulled apart by the gravitational field of the more massive Milky Way galaxy. The main body of the CMa is extremely degraded. Tidal disruption causes a filament of stars to trail behind it as it orbits the Milky Way, forming a complex ringlike structure, sometimes referred to as the Monoceros Ring, which wraps around the Milky Way three times, The stream of stars was discovered in the early 21st century by astronomers conducting the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The Monoceros Ring is similar to the Virgo Stellar Stream which is thought to be the result of the Milky Way tearing stars and gases from the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy into a Stellar Stream. It was in the course of investigating the Monoceros Ring, and a closely spaced group of globular clusters similar to those associated with the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, that the CMa Overdensity was discovered.

Globular clusters thought to be associated with the CMa include NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 2298 and NGC 2808, all of which may have been part of the galaxy&#x27;s globular cluster system before accreting into the Milky Way. NGC 1261 is another nearby cluster, but its velocity differs enough to make its relationship to the system unclear. Additionally, Dolidze 25 and H18 are open clusters that may have formed when the dwarf galaxy perturbed material in the galactic disk, stimulating star formation.

The discovery of the CMa and subsequent analysis of the stars associated with it has provided some support for the current theory that galaxies may grow in size by swallowing their smaller neighbors. Martin et al. believe that the preponderance of evidence points to the accretion of a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way which was orbiting roughly in the plane of the galactic disk.

==Dispute==

Several studies cast doubts on the true nature of this overdensity. Some research suggests that the trail of stars is actually part of the warped galactic thin disk and thick disk population and not a result of the collision of the Milky Way with a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Investigation of the area in 2009 yielded only ten RR Lyrae variable stars, which is consistent with the Milky Way&#x27;s halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

==In fiction==
British science fiction writer Stephen Baxter included the Canis Major Overdensity in his novella &quot;Mayflower II&quot; as the destination of the eponymous starship.

<doc id="1141384" wikidata="Q2973469" url="?curid=1141384" title="Division of Boothby">
<text>The Division of Boothby is an Australian federal electoral division in South Australia. The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named after William Boothby (1829–1903), the Returning Officer for the first federal election.

At the 2016 federal election, the seat covered 130 km², extending from Clarence Gardens and Urrbrae in the north to Marino and part of Happy Valley in the south, including the suburbs of Belair, Blackwood, Brighton, Daw Park, Eden Hills, Marion, Mitcham, Seacliff, St Marys and Panorama.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==
Before 1949 and the creation of the Division of Sturt, Boothby covered most of the southern and eastern suburbs of Adelaide. For much of the first half-century after Federation, it was one of only three seats based on the capital, the others being Adelaide and Hindmarsh. The mostly rural seat of Barker was then considered a &quot;hybrid urban-rural&quot; seat, stretching from the southern tip of South Australia at least as far as Glenelg and the Holdfast Bay area, and at times even stretched as far as the western metropolitan suburbs of Keswick and Henley Beach.

For most of the first half-century after Federation, Boothby was a marginal seat that changed hands several times between the Liberal Party of Australia (and its predecessors) and the Australian Labor Party (ALP). The 1949 expansion of parliament saw parts of the southern portion transferred to the newly created Division of Kingston and parts of the eastern portion transferred to the newly created Sturt. This saw Boothby change from a marginal Labor seat on a 1.8 percent two-party margin to a marginal Liberal seat on a two percent two-party margin. However, as part of the massive Liberal victory in the 1949 election, the Liberals picked up a 9.3 percent two-party swing, turning it into a safe Liberal seat in one stroke. The Liberals mostly held the seat for the next 73 years as a fairly safe Liberal seat.

There was only one substantial redistribution in the past few decades when Boothby absorbed parts of the abolished Division of Hawker before the 1993 election. This cut the Liberal margin by more than half, from a safe 10.7 two-party margin to a marginal notional 4.5 percent two-party margin. However, the Liberals won the seat on a fairly safe 7.8 percent two-party margin. As of 2007, Boothby extended from Mitcham and Belair in the east to Brighton and Seacliff in the west.

Boothby&#x27;s most prominent member was Steele Hall, who most notably served as Premier of South Australia from 1968 to 1970. After leaving state politics, Hall served in the Senate before transferring to Boothby in a 1981 by-election. Hall retired at the 1996 election and the seat was subsequently held from 1996 to 2016 by Andrew Southcott. Other notable members include Lee Batchelor, a minister in the Watson and Fisher governments; Sir John McLeay, who was Speaker from 1956 to 1966, and his son John, Jr., a minister in the Fraser government.

At the 2004 election, despite a solid national two-party swing and vote to the Liberals, Boothby became a marginal Liberal seat for the first time in over half a century, with Labor&#x27;s Chloë Fox reducing the Liberal margin to 5.4 percent even as incumbent Andrew Southcott narrowly won enough primary votes to retain the seat without the need for preferences. Labor&#x27;s Nicole Cornes reduced Southcott&#x27;s margin even further to 2.9 percent at the 2007 election. At the 2010 election Labor&#x27;s Annabel Digance came within 638 votes of ending the long Liberal run in the seat. At 0.75 percent Boothby was the most marginal seat in South Australia. However, Boothby became a fairly safe Liberal seat again at the 2013 election.

In 2015, Southcott announced his retirement from parliament to take effect at the 2016 federal election. The Liberals preselected doctoral student and newspaper columnist Nicolle Flint. Labor preselected 2015 Davenport state by-election candidate Mark Ward. The Nick Xenophon Team announced Mitcham councillor Karen Hockley as their candidate. ABC psephologist Antony Green&#x27;s 2016 federal election guide for South Australia stated NXT had a &quot;strong chance of winning lower house seats and three or four Senate seats&quot;. Flint won the contest. Flint held on narrowly on 53.5 percent of the two-party vote on a swing of 3.6 percent, making the seat marginal once again.

A redistribution ahead of the 2019 federal election pared back the Liberal margin to 2.7 percent. This came even as Boothby absorbed Glenelg and much of the Holdfast Bay area from neighbouring Hindmarsh. Flint won reelection again, despite suffering a swing of 1.3 points. With a margin of 1.3 points, Boothby was the most marginal seat in South Australia and one of the most marginal metropolitan Coalition seats in Australia at the 2022 election.

On 26 February 2021, Flint announced her retirement from parliament to take effect at the 2022 Australian federal election. Vinnies SA CEO Louise Miller-Frost was preselected by Labor in mid-2021 and won the seat at the 21 May 2022 Federal election with 4.66% swing. The seat now has a 3.28% margin.

<text>The History of the Second World War is the official history of the British contribution to the Second World War and was published by Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO). The immense project was sub-divided into areas to ease publication, &quot;United Kingdom Military Series&quot;, the &quot;United Kingdom Civil Series&quot; for the civilian war effort; the &quot;Foreign Policy series&quot;, the &quot;Intelligence series&quot; and the &quot;Medical series&quot; are eponymous. Other volumes not under the aegis of the series but published by HMSO may be read as adjuncts, covering matters not considered in great detail or at all, in one case, in the main series. Further volumes, published after the privatisation of HMSO or in the series about the Special Operations Executive, are also useful.

The volumes were intended to be read individually, rather than in series, which led to some overlapping. In their introductions to their parts of the series, Sir Keith Hancock and Sir James Butler wrote that this was to obviate a need to read more volumes than those covering that part of the war effort. Hancock edited the Civil Series and Butler the Military Series. The first volume appeared in 1949 and the last in 1993, with a revised edition of one volume appearing in 2004. An unorthodox decision was to cover the conflict from a theatre of operations point of view rather than by service, to acknowledge that military operations were intimately linked.

The works published before 1970 lack references to unpublished sources until government archives were opened, to an extent, by the Public Records Act 1958 and the Public Records Act 1967. The works were published with only references to published sources because British constitutional conventions on the anonymity of government officials and ministers were followed, leading to a somewhat detached narrative style in some cases. A parallel series of volumes for official use were printed, which referenced the unpublished sources in manuscript, in red ink. A few official copies &#x27;escaped&#x27; into public libraries and these additions can be seen.

<text>Mount Morgan is the highest point on Nevahbe Ridge in the Sherwin Range of the Sierra Nevada. It lies in Mono County, California, between McGee Canyon and Hilton Lakes. The mountain is in the John Muir Wilderness Area in the Inyo National Forest.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Mount Morgan is located in an alpine climate zone. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range

<text>The Division of Grey is an Australian electoral division in South Australia. The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for Sir George Grey, who was Governor of South Australia from 1841 to 1845 (and later Prime Minister of New Zealand).

==Geography==
The division covers the vast northern outback of South Australia. Highlighting South Australia&#x27;s status as the most centralised state in Australia, Grey spans , over 92 percent of the state. The borders of the electorate include Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales borders, in addition to much of the southern coastal border. The electorate spans to Marion Bay and Eudunda in the south. The main population centres of the electorate include Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Roxby Downs, Coober Pedy, Port Pirie, Kadina, Maitland, Orroroo, Booleroo Centre, Peterborough, Burra and Eudunda.

==Redistributions==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

When Grey was first created in 1903, it included the Northern Territory and all of northern and western South Australia, down to a line through the Mid North south of Port Pirie.

Following the 1949 redistribution it increased in size and covered almost five-sixths of the State of South Australia (111,000 square miles) from the borders with Western Australian and Northern Territory in the West and North to Queensland and New South Wales in the East. The remaining one-sixth of the State was covered by the other nine Federal Divisions for South Australia. 

Grey was held by Labor for much of its history, and was one of the few country seats where Labor usually did well. It remained in Labor hands for all but one term from 1943 to 1993, the only break coming when the Liberals won it during their landslide victory in 1966. For most of that time, it was a fairly safe Labor seat, though it was almost lost in the Coalition landslides in 1975 and 1977.

That changed in 1993, when the retirement of Labor incumbent Lloyd O&#x27;Neil, the unpopularity of the state Labor government, and the addition of the Clare Valley at a redistribution enabled Liberal Barry Wakelin become only the second non-Labor member to win the seat in 50 years. That happened even as Labor won another term; it was the first time Labor had won government at an election without winning Grey. However, the election came at a bad time for the state Labor government, which was roundly defeated at the state election later that year in which it lost all but one seat within Grey&#x27;s borders.

Wakelin was re-elected with a large swing in 1996, and since then the decline in the mining and pastoral vote has made it a fairly safe Liberal seat. While the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; towns of Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie still tilt Labor — as they have for more than a century — they are not enough to overcome the increasingly conservative lean in the rest of the seat.

The Liberals consolidated their hold on the seat ahead of the 2004 election when the Yorke Peninsula and the state&#x27;s upper east, both historically strongly conservative areas, were transferred to Grey from Wakefield. The Liberals suffered a nine-point swing at the 2007 election, but Rowan Ramsey was still able to retain the seat for the Liberals, with 54 percent of the two-party vote. The seat became secure for the Liberals once again after Ramsey picked up a large swing in 2010, which he consolidated in 2013.

===2016 election===
South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon confirmed in December 2014 that by mid-2015 the Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) would announce candidates in all states and territories at the 2016 election, with Xenophon citing the government&#x27;s ambiguity on the Collins-class submarine replacement project as motivation. ABC psephologist Antony Green&#x27;s 2016 federal election guide for South Australia stated NXT had a &quot;strong chance of winning lower house seats and three or four Senate seats&quot;.

Going into the 2016 election, Grey was the second-safest Liberal seat in South Australia; Labor needed a 13-point swing to win it. A ReachTEL seat-level opinion poll in Grey of 665 voters conducted by robocall on 9 June during the election campaign surprisingly found NXT candidate Andrea Broadfoot leading the Liberals&#x27; Ramsey 54–46 on the two-candidate preferred vote. Seat-level opinion polls in the other two rural Liberal South Australian seats revealed NXT also leading in both Mayo and Barker.

Early counting following the poll showed that Broadfoot was a clear second to Ramsey on first preferences, well ahead of the ALP candidate in third place. This meant that the indicative assessment of two-candidate preferred count on election night had been done between the wrong pair, and would need to be redone in the following week to give a clearer indication as to which of Ramsay and Broadfoot would win the seat after distributing all preferences. While Broadfoot was ahead with as much as 80 percent of ballots counted, she ultimately lost to Ramsey on Family First preferences. Ultimately, Ramsey suffered a swing of 11.6 percent after preferences were counted, which made Grey the most marginal Liberal seat in the state and one of the most marginal Coalition-held rural seats in the nation. On a &quot;traditional&quot; two-party basis (Labor vs. Liberal), however, Grey was still a fairly safe Liberal seat.

<text>Arthur L. Farnsworth (born 1962) is an American politician and convicted tax protester. Evidence found by the government in Farnsworth&#x27;s case helped the government indict actor Wesley Snipes on tax charges.

Farnsworth received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Widener University and a master&#x27;s degree in engineering science from Penn State. He ran for a number of offices as a member of the Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania, and served as township auditor for West Rockhill Township. Farnsworth also served as the treasurer of the Pennsylvania Libertarian Party. He ran as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 8th congressional district in 2004 and drew 3,710 votes.

==Tax problems==

In November 2004 Farnsworth was arrested on charges of tax evasion of approximately $87,000 in Federal income taxes under for years 1998, 1999, and 2000. On the campaign trail as well as on his personal website, Farnsworth argued that the federal law makes the payment of income taxes voluntary.

A federal grand jury charged the electrical engineer with failure to pay taxes for three years on more than $221,000 in income and with attempting to conceal his earnings by transferring assets to fraudulent trusts and overseas bank accounts.

During the case, investigators found that one of the trust funds belonged to actor Wesley Snipes. Snipes himself was indicted on tax charges in October 2006. Snipes was convicted of three misdemeanor counts of failing to file Federal income tax returns (and was acquitted on other tax charges).

On December 11, 2006, a federal jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found Farnsworth guilty of tax evasion.

Farnsworth was sentenced on April 3, 2007 to 27 months in prison. He was also fined $500 and ordered to cooperate with Internal Revenue Service investigators in documenting his finances and beginning to pay his tax debt of almost $83,000. On December 11, 2008, Farnsworth&#x27;s conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

Farnsworth was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fairton, New Jersey, and was released in April 2009.

On March 24, 2010, Farnsworth appeared in federal court in Philadelphia in connection with alleged violations of the terms of his release from federal prison. In court papers filed on March 15, 2010, Farnsworth&#x27;s probation officer charged that Farnsworth had refused to comply with directives issued by the Internal Revenue Service required by court order. The government alleged that Farnsworth had been collecting wages &quot;under the table&quot; while working at a sandwich shop and had not reported the wages on his tax returns. On May 3, 2010, U.S. District Judge John R. Padova ordered Farnsworth back to the federal prison camp for an additional four months because of violations of Farnsworth&#x27;s supervised release. Farnsworth was incarcerated at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, and was released on October 1, 2010.

<doc id="1141423" wikidata="Q239914" url="?curid=1141423" title="Steve Finnan">
<text>Stephen John Finnan (born 24 April 1976) is an Irish former international footballer who played as a right-back.

He is the only player to have played in the World Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup, Intertoto Cup, all four levels of the English league football and the Football Conference. Among the honours won during his career was the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final for Liverpool. Finnan was known for his attacking role and ability to cross the ball.

He played 52 internationals for the Republic of Ireland from his debut in 2000, scoring twice. He played for them at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Finnan was born in the Janesboro area of Limerick, and moved to Chelmsford, England, at a young age. He began his career playing in Wimbledon&#x27;s youth system, but he joined non-League club Welling United in 1993 after being released at the age of 16. Finnan turned professional when he signed with Birmingham City in 1995, who paid a fee of £100,000 to Welling United to acquire his services. He scored his first professional goal against Watford.

===Notts County===
Finnan made a loan switch to Notts County in March 1996, making his debut in a 2–1 victory over Walsall and scoring his first goal a month later in a 4–2 victory over Bristol Rovers. He appeared in all of Notts&#x27; games for the remainder of the season, helping the team finish fourth in the Second Division and qualify for the promotion play-offs. In the first leg of the semi-finals held at the Alexandra Stadium he scored against Crewe Alexandra, with the match ending 2–2. The return leg at home saw Notts win 1–0, winning 3–2 on aggregate. In the play-offs final against Bradford City at Wembley Stadium, Notts County lost 2–0. He returned to Birmingham following the conclusion of the loan deal.

During the following season, 1996–97, Notts County signed Finnan for a fee £300,000 on 30 October 1996. He played his first match as a permanent player for Notts County after being introduced as a substitute against Shrewsbury Town. The season was not a successful one for Finnan as Notts County finished 24th in the table and were relegated to the Third Division. 

In the 1997–98 season, his first full season at the club, Finnan established himself as a key member of the team and was an ever present, appearing in 51 matches, helping the club win the Third Division title with record points and time. The other notable record Finnan established with Notts County during this season was a streak of 10 consecutive victories; a club record and one which still stands today.

===Fulham===
After strong showings for Notts County in the 1997–98 season, Fulham manager Kevin Keegan paid £600,000 for his services in November 1998. He made his Fulham debut against Chesterfield on 21 November 1998 and scored his first goal for Fulham against Blackpool on 20 March 1999. While at Fulham, he also became a favourite among the fans. His first season with the club was a success, with Fulham winning the Second Division championship and being promoted to the First Division. 

Finnan finished ninth with Fulham the following season under new manager Paul Bracewell, despite promising early season form and an unbeaten run lasting over two months. Bracewell was replaced with Jean Tigana in May 2000, and under him in the 2000–01 season, Fulham won the First Division championship, winning promotion to the Premier League, with Finnan appearing in all but one of the league matches. 

In his debut season in the Premier League, he helped Fulham qualify for the UEFA Intertoto Cup, was voted into the 2001–02 Professional Footballers&#x27; Association team of the year and was also voted as the Fulham player of the year. Fulham then went on to win the Intertoto Cup, giving Finnan his first taste of European football. Next season saw Jean Tigana replaced by Chris Coleman, Finnan&#x27;s fourth manager in five seasons. By April 2003 with few games to go, Fulham were close to the relegation zone but picked up 10 points out of a possible 15 to stay in the top-flight, finishing in 14th position. 

In the summer of 2003 Finnan found himself courted by many of England&#x27;s top clubs, and eventually Fulham agreed to sell Finnan to Liverpool for a fee of £3.5m.

===Liverpool===

Finnan made his Liverpool debut against Chelsea on 17 August 2003. His first season was disrupted by injury, but in 2004–05, he established himself as the first-choice right-back and a firm fan favourite. The season was a highly successful one for Finnan. He scored his first and only goal for Liverpool against West Bromwich Albion, played in the League Cup final, and was in the starting eleven as Liverpool won the Champions League Final, though a thigh injury meant he was substituted at half time. Finnan&#x27;s goal against WBA meant that he became only the second player to score in each of the five highest divisions of English football; the first was Jimmy Willis.

In the 2005–06 season, Liverpool broke their record for number of points in a Premier League season, finishing on 82 points with Finnan being ever present. At the end of the season he picked up another medal with Liverpool, winning the FA Cup.

Finnan played for Liverpool as first-choice right-back for the 2006–07 season despite heavy competition from newly arrived teammate Álvaro Arbeloa. He started in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final and was subbed off after 88 minutes, Liverpool went on to lose the game 2–1. In July 2007, Finnan agreed a new two-year contract to remain with Liverpool.

The following season, Liverpool&#x27;s success continued as they finished third in the League and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League. Finnan took his total appearances for Liverpool past the 200 mark and also made it into the top 100 capped Liverpool players of all time. Finnan featured in 35 games, but lost his starting place, manager Rafa Benítez often preferring Arbeloa to start. In the summer of 2008, after the arrival of fullback Philipp Degen at the club from Borussia Dortmund, Finnan was linked with a move away from Anfield. He was offered by Liverpool as a makeweight in a deal to sign Gareth Barry from Aston Villa; the player accepted the move but the clubs were unable to agree a fee. He made a guest appearance in Jamie Carragher&#x27;s testimonial match in September 2010.

===Espanyol===
On transfer deadline day, 1 September 2008, Finnan signed a two-year deal with La Liga club Espanyol for an undisclosed fee. Injuries limited his first team appearances, and rumours of a return to the Premier League in the January 2009 transfer window with Arsenal or Tottenham Hotspur were dismissed by Espanyol&#x27;s sports director Paco Herrera and by coach Mané, who considered him an important member of the team. By mid-January, Espanyol were &quot;surprised&quot; that a move to Hull City did not proceed, apparently for medical reasons. In July 2009, Espanyol and Finnan agreed to mutually terminate the remainder of his contract.

===Portsmouth===
Finnan signed a one-year contract with Premier League side Portsmouth on 31 July 2009. He made his debut for the club on 3 October in a 1–0 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, and played regularly in the second half of the season, but with the club in administration and relegated to the Championship, he was not offered a new deal. His last appearance for the club was the 2010 FA Cup Final against Chelsea.

==International career==
A Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, Finnan stepped up to the senior side in 2000 against Greece. He cemented his place in the Irish starting XI during the 2002 World Cup qualification matches, supplying the cross for Jason McAteer to score the only goal in a crucial 1–0 home win against the Netherlands in September 2001.

Finnan appeared in all three of Ireland&#x27;s group E games in the 2002 FIFA World Cup against Cameroon, Germany and Saudi Arabia. Ireland progressed to the second round of the tournament for only the third time in their history where they faced Spain. The match ended 1–1 in extra time and went to penalties. Finnan took a penalty and scored, but Ireland eventually lost 3–2.

Injury disrupted Finnan&#x27;s participation in the unsuccessful attempt to reach the Euro 2004 finals. He was a regular choice in the 2006 World Cup qualification games but Ireland failed to qualify for the finals.

He was again a regular selection in the 2008 Euro qualification games but Ireland did not qualify for the finals. He scored his second international goal in the group game against Cyprus in a 1–1 draw. He then announced his retirement from international football on 22 January 2008 after making 50 appearances for the Republic of Ireland. Tempted by the prospect of working with the newly appointed Ireland manager Giovanni Trapattoni, Finnan came out of retirement in August 2008 to be included in the squad to face Norway in an international friendly.

==Personal life==
Finnan was arrested in June 2005 after running over an 81-year-old man from Liverpool, who later died of his injuries. Finnan faced no charges over the man&#x27;s death, despite travelling more than twice the speed-limit at the time.

In 2015, he was living in London and working in property development.

<text>Bonisile John Kani (born 30 August 1942) is a South African actor. He is known for portraying T&#x27;Chaka in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) and &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), Rafiki in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2019) and Colonel Ulenga in the Netflix films &quot;Murder Mystery&quot; (2019) and &quot;Murder Mystery 2&quot; (2023).

==Early and personal life==
Kani was born on 30 August 1942 in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth In the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. In 1975, after appearing in Athol Fugard&#x27;s anti-apartheid play &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot;, which he also co-wrote, in the United States, Kani returned to South Africa. There, he received a phone call saying that his father wanted to see him. On his way there, he was surrounded by police who beat him and left him for dead. His left eye was lost as a result of the incident, and he now wears a prosthesis which is technically a glass eye.

His son Atandwa is also an actor, who made his debut on U.S. television on the CW series &quot;Life Is Wild&quot;, and played a younger version of Kani&#x27;s character T&#x27;Chaka in &quot;Black Panther&quot;.

==Career==
Kani joined The Serpent Players (a group of actors whose first performance was in the former snake pit of the zoo, hence the name) in Port Elizabeth in 1965 and helped to create many plays that went unpublished but were performed to a resounding reception.

These were followed by the more famous &quot;Sizwe Banzi is Dead&quot; and &quot;The Island&quot;, co-written with Athol Fugard and Winston Ntshona, in the early 1970s. Kani also received an Olivier Award nomination for his role in &quot;My Children! My Africa!&quot;

Kani&#x27;s work has been widely performed around the world, including New York, where he and Winston Ntshona won a Tony Award in 1975 for &quot;Sizwe Banzi Is Dead&quot; (which ran for 159 performances) and &quot;The Island&quot;.&#x27; These two plays were presented in repertory at the Edison Theatre for a total of 52 performances.

In 1987 Kani played Othello in a performance of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name in South Africa, which was still under apartheid. &quot;At least I&#x27;ll be able to kiss Desdemona without leaving a smudge,&quot; he said then.

&quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot; (2002) was his debut as sole playwright and was first performed in the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. This play takes place in post-apartheid South Africa and does not concern the conflicts between whites and blacks, but the rift between blacks who stayed in South Africa to fight apartheid, and those who left only to return when the hated regime folded. It won the 2003 Fleur du Cap Awards for the best actor and best new South African play. In the same year, he was also awarded a special Obie Award for his extraordinary contribution to theatre in the United States.

Kani is executive trustee of the John Kani Theatre Foundation, founder and director of the John Kani Theatre Laboratory and chairman of the National Arts Council of SA. He starred as T&#x27;Chaka in the Marvel Studios blockbusters &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) and &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018). The fact that Kani was a Xhosa native speaker led Chadwick Boseman, who played his onscreen son T&#x27;Challa, to make that Wakanda&#x27;s language, and to learn whole scenes in Xhosa, although he had never studied the language before.

In 2019, Kani appeared in the Netflix film &quot;Murder Mystery&quot; where he played Colonel Ulenga. He then voiced Rafiki in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (the photorealistically animated remake of the Disney animated film).

Kani&#x27;s play, &quot;Kunene and the King&quot;, a co-production for the Royal Shakespeare Company and Fugard Theatre, played in the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in 2019 before transferring back to Cape Town. He starred alongside Antony Sher.

==Other recognition and awards==
On 20 February 2010, Kani received a SAFTA Lifetime award. He has also received the Avanti Hall of Fame Award from the South African film, television, and advertising industries, an M-Net Plum award and a Clio award in New York. Other awards include the Hiroshima Peace Culture Foundation Award for the year 2000 and the Olive Schreiner Prize for 2005. He was voted 51st in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.

In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cape Town. Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University appointed him an honorary Doctor of Philosophy in 2013.

In 2016 Kani received the national honour of the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver, for his &quot;Excellent contributions to theatre and, through this, the struggle for a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa&quot;.

The main theatre of the Market Theatre complex in Newtown, Johannesburg, has been renamed The John Kani Theatre in his honour.

In 2020 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of the Witwatersrand Recently, in 2021, John Kani has been conferred the Da Vinci Laureate by The Da Vinci Institute.

In 2023 he was awarded an Honorary OBE from British Government for services to drama.

== Plot ==
In 1913, Houston, eight-year-old Howard Hughes&#x27; mother gives him a bath and teaches him how to spell &quot;quarantine&quot;, warning him about the recent cholera outbreak. Fourteen years later, in 1927, he begins to direct his film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and hires Noah Dietrich to manage the day-to-day operations of his business empire.

After the release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the result and orders it to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn, who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and germaphobia.

In 1935, Hughes test flies the H-1 Racer, pushing it to a new speed record, despite having to crash-land into a beet field when the aircraft runs out of fuel. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (TWA).

Juan Trippe, company rival and chairman of Pan Am, gets his crony, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, to introduce the Community Airline Bill, which would give Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. Hepburn grows tired of Hughes&#x27; eccentricity and workaholism, and leaves him for fellow actor Spencer Tracy. Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old Faith Domergue, and later actress Ava Gardner. However, he still has feelings for Hepburn, and bribes a reporter to keep reports about her and the married Tracy out of the press.

In the mid-1940s, Hughes contracts two projects with the Army Air Forces, one for a spy aircraft, and another for a troop transport unit for use in World War II.

In 1947, with the H-4 Hercules flying boat still in construction, Hughes finishes the XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight; he crashes in Beverly Hills and is severely injured, but miraculously survives. The army cancels its order for the H-4 Hercules, although Hughes still continues the development with his own money. Dietrich informs Hughes that he must choose between funding the airlines or his flying boat. Hughes orders Dietrich to mortgage the TWA assets so he can continue the development.

As his OCD worsens, Hughes becomes increasingly paranoid, planting microphones and tapping Gardner&#x27;s phone lines to keep track of her, until she kicks him out of her house. The FBI searches his home for incriminating evidence of war profiteering, searching through his possessions.

Brewster privately offers to drop the charges if Hughes sells TWA to Trippe, but Hughes refuses. Hughes&#x27; OCD symptoms become extreme, and he retreats into an isolated &quot;germ-free zone&quot; for three months. Trippe has Brewster summon him for a Senate investigation, certain that Hughes will not show up. Gardner visits him and personally grooms and dresses him in preparation for the hearing.

An invigorated Hughes defends himself against Brewster&#x27;s charges and accuses the Senator of taking bribes from Trippe. He concludes by announcing that he has committed to completing the H-4 aircraft, and that he will leave the country if he cannot get it to fly. Brewster&#x27;s bill is promptly defeated.

After successfully flying the aircraft, Hughes speaks with Dietrich and his engineer, Glenn Odekirk, about a new jetliner for TWA. However, he begins hallucinating men in germ-resistant suits, and has a panic attack. As Odekirk hides him in a restroom while Dietrich fetches a doctor, Hughes begins to have flashbacks of his childhood, his love for aviation and his ambition for success, compulsively repeating the phrase &quot;the way of the future&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Warren Beatty planned to direct and star in a Howard Hughes biopic in the early 1970s. He co-wrote the script with Bo Goldman after a proposed collaboration with Paul Schrader fell through. Goldman wrote his own script, &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot;, which depicted Hughes&#x27; possible relationship with Melvin Dummar. Beatty&#x27;s thoughts regularly returned to the project over the years, and in 1990 he approached Steven Spielberg to direct Goldman&#x27;s script. Beatty&#x27;s Hughes biopic was eventually released under the title &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; in 2016. Charles Evans, Jr. purchased the film rights of &quot;Howard Hughes: The Untold Story&quot; () in 1993. Evans secured financing from New Regency Productions, but development stalled.

&quot;The Aviator&quot; was a joint production between Warner Bros. Pictures, which handled Latin American and Canadian distribution, and Disney, which released the film internationally under its Miramax Films banner in the United States and the United Kingdom. Disney previously developed a Hughes biopic with director Brian De Palma and actor Nicolas Cage between 1997 and 1998. Titled &quot;Mr. Hughes&quot;, the film would have starred Cage in the dual roles of both Hughes and Clifford Irving. It was conceived when De Palma and Cage were working on &quot;Snake Eyes&quot; with writer David Koepp. Universal Pictures joined the competition in March 1998 when it purchased the film rights to &quot;Empire: The Life, Legend and Madness of Howard Hughes&quot; (), written by Donald Barlett and James Steele.

The Hughes brothers were going to direct Johnny Depp as Howard Hughes, based on a script by Terry Hayes. Universal canceled it when they decided they did not want to fast-track development to compete with Disney. In the mid-1990s and early 2000s, director Miloš Forman was in talks to direct a film about the early life of Hughes with Edward Norton as Hughes. In 2001, another version was announced to be produced and directed by William Friedkin, who intended to make a three-hour film about Hughes based on the book &quot;Hughes: The Private Diaries, Memos and Letters&quot; by Richard Hack. In a 2002 report from &quot;Variety&quot;, it was revealed that Norman Jewison had been developing a Hughes biopic based on Terry Moore&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Beauty and the Billionaire&quot; for &quot;more than a year&quot; and was going to meet with John Travolta for the role. Also, in the early 2000s, director Christopher Nolan had developed a film about Hughes, itself also based on Hack&#x27;s biography. All other versions were shelved when Martin Scorsese came aboard to direct &quot;The Aviator&quot;, though Nolan would later return to his Howard Hughes project after completing &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; in 2012, using the book &quot;Citizen Hughes: The Power, the Money and the Madness&quot; by Michael Drosnin as the source. Nolan wrote the script himself, which followed the darker and final years of Hughes&#x27;s life. Nolan, once again, shelved the project when Warren Beatty was developing his long-awaited Hughes film. It was reported that Nolan&#x27;s version would have starred Jim Carrey as Hughes.

Disney restarted development on a new Howard Hughes biopic in June 1999, hiring Michael Mann to direct Leonardo DiCaprio playing the role of Howard Hughes, based on a script by John Logan. The studio put it in turnaround again following the disappointing box-office performance of Mann&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;The Insider&quot;. New Line Cinema picked it up in turnaround almost immediately, with Mann planning to direct after finishing &quot;Ali&quot;. Mann was eventually replaced by Scorsese, who had worked with DiCaprio on &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;. Scorsese later said that he &quot;grossly misjudged the budget&quot;. Angelina Jolie was approached by the studios to have a role in the film but she turned it down after learning executive producer Harvey Weinstein was involved with the film.

Hughes suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), most notably an obsession with germs and cleanliness. DiCaprio himself suffered from a mild version of the disorder as a child, which returned when filming the movie.
Scorsese and DiCaprio worked closely with Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz, MD of UCLA, to portray the most accurate depiction of OCD. The filmmakers had to focus both on previous accounts of Hughes&#x27; behaviors as well as the time period, given that when Hughes was suffering from the disorder, there was no psychiatric definition for what ailed him. Instead of receiving proper treatment, Hughes was forced to hide his stigmatized compulsions; his disorder began to conflict with everyday functioning.

DiCaprio dedicated hundreds of hours of work to portray Hughes&#x27; unique case of OCD on screen. Apart from doing his research on Hughes, DiCaprio met with people suffering from OCD. In particular, he focused on the way some individuals would compulsively and repeatedly wash their hands, later inspiring the scene in which his hand starts to bleed as he scrubs it in the bathroom. The character arc of Howard Hughes was a drastic one: from the height of his career to the appearance of his compulsions, and eventually, to him sitting naked in a screening room, refusing to leave, and later repeating the phrase &quot;the way of the future.&quot;

=== Cinematography ===
In an article for the &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;, John Pavlus wrote: &quot;The film boasts an ambitious fusion of period lighting techniques, extensive effects sequences and a digital re-creation of two extinct cinema color processes: two-color and three-strip Technicolor.&quot; For the first 52 minutes of the film, scenes appear in shades of only red and cyan blue; green objects are rendered as blue. This was done, according to Scorsese, to emulate the look of early bipack color films, in particular the Multicolor process, which Hughes himself owned, emulating the available technology of the era. Similarly, many of the scenes depicting events occurring after 1935 are treated to emulate the saturated appearance of three-strip Technicolor. Other scenes were stock footage colorized and are incorporated into the film. The color effects were created by Legend Films.

=== Production design ===
Scale models were used to duplicate many of the flying scenes in the film. When Martin Scorsese began planning his aviation epic, a decision was made to film flying sequences with scale models rather than CGI special effects. The critical reaction to the CGI models in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001) had been a crucial factor in Scorsese&#x27;s decision to use full-scale static and scale models in this case. The building and filming of the flying models proved both cost-effective and timely.

The primary scale models were the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; and the XF-11; both flyable scale models were designed and fabricated over a period of several months by Aero Telemetry, an aerospace company that specializes in building unmanned air vehicles.

The &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; model had a wingspan of while the XF-11 had a wingspan. Another set of miniatures was built as a motion control miniature used for &quot;beauty shots&quot; of the model taking off and in flight as well as in dry dock and under construction at the miniature Hughes Hangar built by New Deal Studios. The XF-11 was reverse engineered from photographs and some rare drawings and then modeled in Rhinoceros 3D by the Aero Telemetry engineering department and New Deal art department. These 3D models of the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; as well as the XF-11 were then used for patterns and construction drawings for the model makers. In addition to the aircraft, the homes that the XF-11 crashes into were fabricated at 1:4 scale to match the 1:4 scale XF-11. The model was rigged to be crashed and break up several times for different shots.

The Aero Telemetry team was given only three months to complete the three models including the 450 lb H-1 Racer, with an wingspan, that had to stand-in for the full-scale replica that was destroyed in a crash, shortly before principal photography began.

The models were shot on location at Long Beach and other California sites from helicopter or raft platforms. The short but much heralded flight of Hughes&#x27; HK-1 Hercules on November 2, 1947, was realistically recreated in the Port of Long Beach. The motion control &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; and Hughes Hangar miniatures built by New Deal Studios are on display at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, with the original Hughes H-1 &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;.

== Release ==
=== Distribution ===
Warner Bros. Pictures originally bought North American distribution rights to &quot;The Aviator&quot; shortly before production on the film began. However, a heavy release schedule for Warner Bros. Pictures during the fourth quarter of 2004 prompted the company to start discussions to sell distribution rights in the United States to Miramax Films. The talks were successful, with Warner Bros. Pictures and Miramax Films splitting costs and revenues 50/50 on the film&#x27;s domestic release. Miramax Films distributed the film in the United States, the United Kingdom as well as Italy, France and Germany. Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media (via Miramax) also held the rights to the US television distribution, while Warner Bros. Pictures retained the rights for home video distribution in North America (though the North American home video releases feature the Miramax Films logo at the beginning of the film instead) and theatrical release in Canada and Latin America. Initial Entertainment Group released the film in the remaining territories around the world.

=== Box office performance ===
&quot;The Aviator&quot; was given a limited release on December 17, 2004, in 40 theaters where it grossed $858,021 on its opening weekend. It was given a wide release on December 25, 2004, and opened in 1,796 theaters in the United States, grossing $4.2 million on its opening day and $8.6 million in its opening weekend, ranking No. 4 with a per theater average of $4,805. On its second weekend, it moved up to No. 3 and grossed $11.4 million – $6,327 per theater. The film grossed $102.6 million in the United States and Canada and $111.1 million overseas, for a worldwide total of $213.7 million, against an estimated production cost of $110 million.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on DVD in a two-disc-set in widescreen and fullscreen versions on May 24, 2005 by Warner Home Video. The first disc includes commentary with director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker and producer Michael Mann. The second disc includes &quot;The Making of &#x27;The Aviator&#x27; &quot;, &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot;, &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;, &quot;Scoring &quot;The Aviator&quot;&quot;, &quot;Visual Effects&quot;, featurettes on Howard Hughes as well as other special features. The DVD was nominated for Best Audio Commentary (New to DVD) at the DVD Exclusive Awards in 2006.

The film was later released in high definition on Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD on November 6, 2007.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Aviator&quot; has an approval rating of 86% based on 230 reviews, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With a rich sense of period detail, &quot;The Aviator&quot; succeeds thanks to typically assured direction from Martin Scorsese and a strong performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who charts Howard Hughes&#x27; descent from eccentric billionaire to reclusive madman.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four and described the film and its subject, Howard Hughes, in these terms: &quot;What a sad man. What brief glory. What an enthralling film...There&#x27;s a match here between Scorsese and his subject, perhaps because the director&#x27;s own life journey allows him to see Howard Hughes with insight, sympathy – and, up to a point, with admiration. This is one of the year&#x27;s best films.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Sukhdev Sandhu praised Scorsese&#x27;s direction, DiCaprio and the supporting cast but considered Beckinsale &quot;miscast&quot;. Of the film, he said it is &quot;a gorgeous tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood&quot; even though it &quot;tips the balance of spectacle versus substance in favour of the former.&quot; David T. Courtwright in &quot;The Journal of American History&quot; characterized &quot;The Aviator&quot; as a technically brilliant and emotionally disturbing film. According to him, the main achievement for Scorsese is that he managed to restore the name of Howard Hughes as a pioneer aviator. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as visually appealing, but &quot;disappointingly hollow&quot; as an account of Hughes&#x27; early life. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the film, including the cinematography, production and set design, and editing. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the film in general, however criticized some casting choices, including the then 30-year-old DiCaprio playing Hughes in his 40&#x27;s, and the performances of Gwen Stefani, Kate Beckinsale, and Cate Blanchett, though noting Blanchett warmed up to the role as the film progressed.

=== Accolades ===

The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning five for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction and Best Supporting Actress for Blanchett. It was also nominated for fourteen BAFTAs, winning four for Best Film, Best Makeup and Hair, Best Production Design and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, six Golden Globe Awards, winning three for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Original Score and Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for DiCaprio and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, winning one for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.

== Aircraft depicted and used ==
Numerous aircraft were depicted and/or actually used in the film, and were organic to the story. These included aircraft that Hughes had built, airliners that his airline (TWA) used, and other aircraft. Among these were:

* Hughes H-1 Racer, a pioneering single-engine race plane that set speed records, including the 1935 international speed record of , and the 1937 U.S. transcontinental record of seven hours, 28 minutes. It featured many relatively new innovations in aircraft design, and was the &quot;state of the art&quot; aircraft of its time, briefly. The original is in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum. A replica planned for the movie crashed, and a model was used instead.
* Hughes XF-11, a photographic reconnaissance plane—a twin-engine, twin-boom, fast, high-flying aircraft designed during World War II (WWII) to fly faster and higher than enemy fighters. It was originally commissioned by the U.S. government in a contract with Hughes Aircraft, but the war ended while the aircraft was still in development. The first prototype was equipped with troublesome contra-rotating propellers which failed while Hughes was piloting it on its maiden flight; he did not react properly to the propeller failure and was critically injured in the ensuing crash in Beverly Hills, as depicted in the film. A second prototype equipped with conventional single propellers later flew successfully, but the military had chosen other aircraft for its purpose, and it was scrapped. As the movie shows, Hughes was subsequently accused of duping the military and failing to deliver, leading to a congressional investigation. Models replicated the plane for the movie.
* Hughes HK-1 / H-4 Hercules (nicknamed the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; for its all-wood construction), a giant flying boat transport—one of the largest and most famous aircraft ever built. As with the XF-11, its development was originally commissioned by the U.S. government during WWII in a contract with Hughes Aircraft, the war ended while the aircraft was still in development, the contract was canceled, and it became a topic in the resulting congressional investigation. Hughes responded that he would prove the Hercules could fly—and subsequently did so in a short hop in Long Beach Harbor (though historians note that the aircraft never escaped ground effect, near the surface, to fly completely free and at altitude). The airplane never flew again, and became a floating museum display, dockside in the harbor—eventually moved to the Evergreen Aviation Museum in Oregon. The real aircraft was used sparingly in the movie, but only models of it actually move in the film.
* Sikorsky S-38 amphibian—a &quot;flying yacht&quot; for the wealthy. This medium-sized, twin-engined flying boat, with retractable wheels, was among Hughes&#x27; personal aircraft. Though several were built for wealthy fliers in the 1930s (including Hughes), none survive, today—except for two replicas that were built in recent years at a cost of well over $1,000,000 apiece (these were used in the film).
* L-049 Lockheed Constellation airliner, one of the first pressurized-cabin, ocean-spanning airliners, largely developed for Hughes&#x27; airline, TWA. The airplane was conspicuous for its triple-tail vertical stabilizers and shapely curving fuselage. The Constellation was powered by four of the largest piston engines ever built by 1941, the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone (bested by the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major in 1944), it became the most advanced airliner in the world at its inception—capable of transcontinental flights in half the normal time (as little as seven hours). It was used by the military in World War II, and became one of the world&#x27;s principal airliners of the 1950s, instrumental in making TWA the world&#x27;s largest airline. The film used a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation in TWA livery, C/N 4830 &quot;Star of America,&quot; a Constellation restored to airworthiness, flown to and from the Burbank airport for filming from Kansas City MO, and stored at the National Airline History Museum in Kansas City, Missouri (TWA&#x27;s former home base).

<text>Norman Clyde (April 8, 1885 – December 23, 1972) was a mountaineer, mountain guide, freelance writer, nature photographer, and self-trained naturalist. He is well known for achieving over 130 first ascents, many in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada and Montana&#x27;s Glacier National Park. He also set a speed climbing record on California&#x27;s Mount Shasta in 1923.
The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley has 1467 articles written by Clyde in its archives.

== Early life, marriage and work ==
Clyde was born in Philadelphia, the son of a Reformed Presbyterian minister. He attended Geneva College graduating in the Classics in June 1909. After teaching at several rural schools, including schools in Fargo, North Dakota and Mount Pleasant, Utah, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley in 1911. After two years of graduate work he returned to teaching, mostly in northern California, including the towns of McCloud and Weaverville. He taught history, science, and Latin. He continued graduate studies at the University of California in Berkeley in 1923–24.

On June 15, 1915, Norman Clyde married Winifred May Bolster in Pasadena, California. She was a nurse at a tuberculosis hospital and contracted the disease herself at approximately the time of their marriage. After four years of suffering from the disease she died at age 28 in 1919. His wife&#x27;s death appears to have profoundly affected him, as he moved to the Eastern Sierra to spend much of his latter life alone in the mountains.
He became principal of the high school in Independence, California in 1924, but resigned in 1928. He admitted firing a pistol during a confrontation with some students who allegedly came to vandalize the school on Halloween night. One bullet hit the side of a car carrying eight high school students; there were no injuries. Clyde said that considerable damage had been done to the school grounds the previous Halloween. He had been issued a license to carry a concealed firearm on February 2, 1928. The episode marked the end of his career as a schoolteacher and principal, as he resigned in exchange for an agreement by the District Attorney not to press charges.

Subsequently, he spent his winters as the caretaker of the local lodges, including Glacier Lodge on Big Pine Creek, and Lon Chaney Cabin, a fishing cabin that belonged to Lon Chaney, Sr. He earned some sporadic income as a mountain guide and freelance writer.

== Life in the mountains ==
Clyde began climbing in the Sierra Nevada in 1910, when he visited Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, writing to his mother that &quot;I climbed the highest mountains in the region&quot;. He also visited McCloud, near Mount Shasta, that summer. He began a regimented program of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada in 1914, including the first of his first ascents. He joined the Sierra Club in 1914. He first climbed Mount Shasta in 1916, and climbed that peak a total of twelve times. While living in Southern California during his wife&#x27;s illness, he climbed Mount San Jacinto in 1917. Following his wife&#x27;s death in 1919, he climbed extensively in the Kings-Kern Divide region of the southern Sierra.

In 1920, Clyde journeyed with a Sierra Club group from Yosemite Valley to the Evolution Basin, completing many climbs along the way. He set a speed climbing record on Mount Shasta in 1923, ascending from Horse Camp at approximately to the summit at in 3 hours and 17 minutes. That year, he also spent 36 days in Glacier National Park, Montana, where he climbed 36 mountains, including 11 first ascents, one of which bears his name (Clyde Peak). The National Park Service issued a press release praising his accomplishments in Glacier National Park. He returned to climb in Glacier National Park in 1924 and 1937.

In 1925, he completed 53 climbs in the Sierra Nevada, and told Francis Farquhar that &quot;I sometimes think I climbed enough peaks this summer to render me a candidate for a padded cell — at least some people look at the matter in that way. However, I get a lot of enjoyment from this rather strenuous form of diversion.&quot; In 1926, he climbed in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, the Beartooth Mountains and Absaroka Range of Montana, and the Sawtooth Range of Idaho. He made several additional first ascents in California that year.

In 1928, he was a leader of the High Trip to the Canadian Rockies organized by the Sierra Club, the Mazamas of Oregon, and The Mountaineers of the State of Washington. During this trip, he encountered professional mountain guides, and probably decided on this as his own career path. He spent six weeks traversing the San Gabriels of Southern California, probably in 1929. In 1930, he wrote an article describing his trip from the summit of Mount Whitney to the lowest point in Death Valley between sunrise and sunset.

Clyde&#x27;s first published works appeared as a series of articles entitled &quot;Close Ups of the High Sierra&quot; in 1928, in the Automobile Club of Southern California&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Touring Topics,&quot; and were later republished as a perfect-bound edition in 1962 by La Siesta Press (Glendale, California), edited by Walt Wheelock.

1931 was a seminal year in the history of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada, and Norman Clyde was in the thick of it. Sierra Club leader Francis P. Farquhar invited Harvard philosophy professor and Appalachian Mountain Club member Robert L. M. Underhill to come to the Sierra Nevada to teach the latest techniques of roped climbing. Underhill had learned these techniques in the Alps, and had practiced them himself earlier that summer in the Tetons and the Canadian Rockies. After some young climbers were instructed in the techniques, a group including Clyde, Jules Eichorn, Lewis Clark, Bestor Robinson and Glen Dawson traveled south to the Palisades, the most rugged and alpine part of the Sierra Nevada. There, on August 13, 1931, the party completed the first ascent of the last unclimbed 14,000+ foot peak in California, which remained unnamed due to its remote location above the Palisade Glaciers. After a challenging ascent to the summit, the climbers were caught in an intense lightning storm, and Eichorn barely escaped electrocution when &quot;a thunderbolt whizzed right by my ear&quot;. The mountain was named Thunderbolt Peak to commemorate that close call.

Three days later on August 16, Eichorn, Clyde, Underhill and Dawson completed the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States. The route was extremely exposed, especially the famous Fresh Air Traverse. Steve Roper called this route &quot;one of the classic routes of the Sierra, partly because of its spectacular location and partly because it was the first really big wall to be climbed in the range.&quot; Porcella &amp; Burns wrote that &quot;the climb heralded a new standard of technical competence in Californian rock climbing…&quot; These events led to a lifelong friendship between Clyde and Jules Eichorn.

In 1932, he climbed El Picacho del Diablo in Baja California, Mexico, and climbed it again in 1937. He met David Brower in the Sierra Nevada in 1933, and in 1934 spent time with Brower and Hervey Voge as the younger men bagged 32 first ascents in ten weeks traveling through the High Sierra. From June 23–26, the trio climbed 10 of the 12 major pinnacles of the Devils Crags.

He served as climbing leader on many High Trips sponsored by the Sierra Club and became known as &quot;the pack that walks like a man&quot; because of the huge backpacks he carried. In addition to as many as five cameras, he carried a hammer and cobbler&#x27;s anvil in order to make field repairs to client&#x27;s boots. In 1931, Underhill wrote that Clyde&#x27;s backpack was an &quot;especially picturesque enormity of skyscraper architecture&quot;. Clyde was also well known for wearing a campaign hat.

Clyde led or participated in many mountain rescues and is credited with saving a number of lives. He also helped in many recoveries of dead climbers, such as 18-year-old Howard Lamel, killed in a fall on Mount Whitney in 1930. He is remembered for discovering Pete Starr&#x27;s body in the Minarets, in 1933, after all other searchers gave up. Clyde later returned to the site with Jules Eichorn, and they buried Starr&#x27;s body where Clyde had found it on Michael Minaret.

Norman Clyde still guided parties into the Sierra into the 1960s, when he was in his seventies. In the 1950s and 1960s, he lived by himself at the old Baker ranch-house on Baker Creek near Big Pine. Clyde, who had been trained in the classics, loved to read books in Latin and Greek. At the Baker ranch-house, Clyde had thousands of rare classical books. At age 80, he was still sleeping outside the ranch-house on a mattress and sleeping bag, as long as it was fair weather. In the spring of 1968, he transferred to a skilled nursing facility in Bishop where he could receive adequate care. In 1969, his cancerous left eye was removed. He died in Bishop on December 23, 1972, at age 87, surrounded by the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada that he loved so much. The cause of death was &quot;metastatic melanoma – primary in eye.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Norman Clyde received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from his alma mater, Geneva College, in 1939. He received the college&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award in 1962.

In 1947, the Sierra Club Handbook praised Clyde&#x27;s mountaineering accomplishments: Outstanding among members who have helped others gain mountain experience is Norman Clyde, whose amazing achievements in scaling practically all the peaks in the High Sierra are well known to mountaineers. More than one climber has exulted in a supposedly first ascent, only to find later that Clyde went up that &quot;unclimbed peak&quot; in the winter of, say, 1920! There are many seasoned climbers who can look back on their early days as novices in the mountains and remember with gratitude what they learned from Clyde.

Jointly with Allen Steck, he was the first recipient of the Sierra Club&#x27;s Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award in 1970.

Clyde Minaret, Clyde Spires, Clyde&#x27;s Ledge, Clyde&#x27;s Meadow along the Mountaineer&#x27;s Route on Mount Whitney, and Norman Clyde Peak bear his name. His ashes were scattered from Norman Clyde Peak by Smoke Blanchard, his son Bob Blanchard, and a party that included Jules Eichorn.

The Eastern California Museum in Independence has an extensive collection of memorabilia, documents and photos pertaining to Clyde&#x27;s life on display. &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; extreme sports correspondent Michael J. Ybarra described this exhibit as &quot;absorbing&quot;.

Norman Clyde&#x27;s life and mountaineering achievements were documented in the book, &quot;Close Ups of the High Sierra,&quot; published by La Siesta Press (Glendale, California) in 1962. In 1998, Spotted Dog Press published an expanded edition of the book, &quot;Norman Clyde: Close Up of the High Sierra&quot;, edited by Wynne Benti. The foreword to the 1998 edition of &quot;Close Ups of the High Sierra&quot; included a brief biography of Clyde, written by Benti, which contained the first in-depth information published about Clyde&#x27;s wife, Winifred Bolster.

Clyde&#x27;s life and mountaineering achievements were later documented in a biography written by Robert C. Pavlik and published in 2008.

<doc id="1141452" wikidata="Q7380957" url="?curid=1141452" title="Ruskin House">
<text>Ruskin House, situated in its own grounds on Coombe Road, Croydon, South London, has been a centre of Britain&#x27;s progressive movements for a century. It is the headquarters of the Communist Party of Britain and Croydon&#x27;s Labour, Trade Union and Co-operative movements and is itself a co-operative with shareholders from organisations across the four movements.

== Ruskin House timeline ==
===The first Ruskin House===
In the nineteenth century, Croydon was a bustling commercial centre in Surrey but in close proximity to London. It was said that, at the turn of the twentieth century, approximately £10,000 was spent in Croydon&#x27;s taverns and inns every week. For the early labour movement, then, it was natural to meet in the town&#x27;s public houses, in this environment. However, the temperance movement was equally strong, and Georgina King Lewis, a keen member of the Croydon United Temperance Council, took it upon herself to establish a dry centre for the labour movement.

Named after John Ruskin, the first Ruskin House was highly successful. It was described as one of the greatest temperance achievements in the history of Croydon. Meetings took place every night wherever space was available. Indeed, requests for meeting space were frequently turned down. Many trade union branches, friendly societies and the Labour Party all held their meetings here.

===The second Ruskin House===
By the end of the First World War, the local labour movement had far outgrown its main premises. Therefore, in 1919, a private residence named &#x27;Netherton&#x27; on Wellesley Road was bought by the Ruskin House committee. In the 1920s, the Labour Party employed full-time staff in the building. Later, in the 1930s and 1940s, whist drives, socials and dances, political rallies and meetings, and even a Ruskin Repertory Theatre were based in the building. The left-wing writer and translator Eden Paul was a night warden at the premises in 1940. The Young Communist League held its meetings in the building. In the 1960s, Croydon&#x27;s centre underwent massive reconstruction, and the second Ruskin House was demolished.

===The current Ruskin House===
In 1966, a well-proportioned Georgian townhouse in Coombe Road was purchased by the Ruskin House committee. It had formerly been the home of an Italian vice-consul and a private prep school. It was officially opened in 1967 by the then Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. With a large, walled garden, the building is in pleasant surroundings. Far removed from the original dry Ruskin House, the current building has its own bar. Today, Ruskin House continues to serve as the headquarters of the Communist Party of Britain, Croydon Labour Party, and the local trade union movements and Co-operative movements. Geraint Davies, the MP for Croydon Central until 2005, also had offices in the building.

==Other tenants==
Ruskin House serves as a launchpad and maildrop for other businesses, if the aims of the owners coincide with the aims of the child organisation. Some of the other tenants have included:

<doc id="1141454" wikidata="Q2973414" url="?curid=1141454" title="Division of Hindmarsh">
<text>The Division of Hindmarsh is an Australian Electoral Division in South Australia covering the north western and western coastal suburbs of Adelaide. The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was split on 2 October 1903, and was first contested at the 1903 election, though now on slightly different boundaries. The Division is named after Sir John Hindmarsh, who was Governor of South Australia from 1836 to 1838. Since the 2019 Australian federal election The Division of Hindmarsh consists of part of the City of Charles Sturt, part of the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, and part of the City of West Torrens.

==Geography==
The 78 km2 seat extends from the coast in the west to South Road in the east, covering the suburbs of Ascot Park, Brooklyn Park, Edwardstown, Fulham, Glenelg, Grange, Henley Beach, Kidman Park, Kurralta Park, Morphettville, Plympton, Richmond, Semaphore Park, Torrensville, West Beach and West Lakes. The Adelaide International Airport was centrally located in the electorate, making noise pollution a prominent local issue, besides the aged care needs of the relatively elderly population − the seat has one of Australia&#x27;s highest proportions of citizens over the age of 65.

==History (1903-1993)==

The Division was one of the seven established when the multi-member Division of South Australia was redistributed into single-member seats on 2 October 1903. The Division comprised the South Australian House of Assembly District of Port Adelaide, with the addition of Goodwood from the District of Torrens. There were 13 Polling Places for the 1903 Australian federal election located within the Division — Port Adelaide, Lefevre&#x27;s Peninsula, Alberton, Rosewater, Woodville, York, Hindmarsh, Thebarton, Hilton, Henley Beach, Plympton, Goodwood and Grand Junction. 

The Division together with the seats of Adelaide and Boothby covered the metropolitan area of Adelaide until 1949. The south-east state border rural seat of Barker was then considered a &quot;hybrid urban-rural&quot; seat, stretching all the way from the southern tip of South Australia at least as far as Glenelg and the Holdfast Bay area, and at times even stretched as far as the western metropolitan suburbs of Keswick and Henley Beach. 

Redistributions from the late 1940s onward have moved Hindmarsh clear of its initial boundaries over time to include increasingly wealthy seaside suburbs in and around Glenelg and the Holdfast Bay area to the south. Though initially based on the greater Port Adelaide area to the north of the present boundary this locality was now represented by the Division of Port Adelaide which was created in 1949 following an increase in the Australian House of Representatives from 74 to 121 seats.

After 1949 some of the area had variously been covered by Boothby, Kingston and now-abolished Hawker which was created in 1969. The present Hindmarsh has changed little geographically since neighbouring Division of Hawker was abolished in 1993, though the north-western coastal strip was added from 2004.

Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

A redistribution ahead of the 1984 election made Hindmarsh far less safe for Labor. From then on, successive redistributions gradually gave it a voting pattern similar to mortgage belt seats, which tend to be fairly marginal. Though now a marginal seat, for nearly a century it had been one of the safest Labor seats in the country, and was in Labor hands for all but three years from the 1903 election to the 1993 election. As a measure of the strength of Labor support at the time, it was the only seat in the state won by Labor in the massive United Australia Party landslide of 1931. One of the few times that Labor&#x27;s hold on the seat was seriously threatened in this time came in 1966, when the Labor margin was pared down to 1.7 percent after a 20% swing. Even then, sitting member Clyde Cameron still won enough primary votes to retain the seat outright. Hindmarsh had long been dominated by working-class families and aged pensioners. Progressive boundary redistributions over many decades transformed Hindmarsh from a safe Labor seat in to a marginal seat often won by the government of the day.

==Prominent members==
Prominent members for the electorate have included Norman Makin, who was Speaker in the Scullin government, and a cabinet minister in the Curtin and Chifley governments, and Clyde Cameron, who was a cabinet minister in the Whitlam government.

==Elections 1993-2016==

Labor&#x27;s hold on the seat became even more tenuous in the redistribution prior to the 1993 election when it absorbed most of the area around Holdfast Bay that had previously been in abolished Hawker. This reduced Labor&#x27;s two-party margin from an already marginal 5.3 percent to a paper-thin one percent. Combined with state-level anger at the time stemming from the State Bank Collapse, this was enough for Liberal Chris Gallus, previously the member for Hawker, to win the seat in 1993 with a one percent two-party margin from a two percent two-party swing, becoming only the second non-Labor MP ever to win it. She seemingly consolidated her hold on the seat at the 1996 election amid her party&#x27;s large victory that year, increasing her margin to 8.1 percent – easily the strongest result for a non-Labor candidate in the seat&#x27;s history.

Gallus fended off spirited challenges from Labor&#x27;s Steve Georganas at both the 1998 election and 2001 election, winning each time with a margin of less than two percent. When Gallus retired at the 2004 election, Georganas won the seat on a razor-thin 0.06 percent two-party margin from a one percent two-party swing, defeating Liberal candidate Simon Birmingham. 

Georganas substantially increased his two-party margin above five percent at both the 2007 election and the 2010 election. Though Georganas was thought to have built up a base with the substantial Greek community in Hindmarsh (he is himself of Greek descent), he was defeated at the 2013 election when Liberal Matt Williams won the seat with a 1.89 percent margin from a 7.97 percent two-party-preferred swing. He became its third non-Labor member, and the first to oust a sitting Labor MP in the seat. The only South Australian seat to change hands in 2013, Hindmarsh became the most marginal seat in South Australia, and the only marginal Liberal seat in the state, only to be won back by Georganas for Labor at the 2016 election.

Being the only South Australian seat changing hands and won by the incoming government in 2013, coupled with being the only South Australian seat changing hands in 2016 aside from Mayo, underscored the marginal seat volatility of present-day Hindmarsh. Not a bellwether electorate however, ABC psephologist Antony Green listed the nearby Division of Makin as one of eleven seats throughout Australia which he classed as bellwethers in his 2016 pre-election guide, and was the only bellwether outside of New South Wales and Queensland.

==2016 election==
South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon confirmed in December 2014 that by mid-2015 the Nick Xenophon Team (NXT) party would announce candidates in the South Australian Liberal seats of Hindmarsh, Sturt and Mayo, along with seats in all states and territories at the 2016 federal election, with Xenophon citing the government&#x27;s ambiguity on the Collins-class submarine replacement project as motivation. ABC psephologist Antony Green&#x27;s 2016 federal election guide for South Australia stated NXT had a &quot;strong chance of winning lower house seats and three or four Senate seats&quot;. The NXT candidate in Hindmarsh was Daniel Kirk.

Going into the 2016 election with a slender 1.9 percent two-party Liberal margin, Hindmarsh was the most marginal seat in South Australia, the government&#x27;s only marginal seat in South Australia, the Coalition&#x27;s only gain at the 2013 election in South Australia, and was the sixth most marginal Coalition-held seat in the nation. Georganas sought to retake the seat from Williams. A Galaxy seat-level opinion poll of over 500 voters in Hindmarsh conducted a week out from the Saturday 2 July election indicated a knife-edge 50–50 two-party vote. Ultimately, NXT preferences allowed Georganas to reclaim Hindmarsh for Labor with a two-party margin of just 0.6 percent, representing a two-party swing of 2.5 percent. Though slender, Georganas was first elected to Hindmarsh at the 2004 election with a two-party margin of just 0.06 percent.

==2018 redistribution and 2019 election==
Hindmarsh&#x27;s character was significantly altered in a redistribution ahead of the 2019 federal election. Neighbouring Port Adelaide was abolished, with the bulk of its territory transferred to Hindmarsh; as mentioned above, Hindmarsh had been based on Port Adelaide for much of the first half-century after Federation. At the same time, the Holdfast Bay area was transferred to Boothby. This had the effect of making Labor&#x27;s hold on Hindmarsh much more secure; on the new boundaries, Labor&#x27;s margin increased from 0.6 percent to a notional 8.2 percent. At the 2019 federal election, Georgeanas contested the neighbouring seat of Adelaide where Labor incumbent Kate Ellis was retiring, to allow the former member for Port Adelaide, Mark Butler, to follow most of his constituents into the changed Hindmarsh.

<text>Anthony Edward Barton (8 April 1937 – 20 August 1993) was an English footballer, playing as an outside right, and football manager. He was born in Sutton, Surrey and managed Aston Villa to success in the 1982 European Cup, three months after taking charge. He followed this up by beating Barcelona in the 1982 European Super Cup.

==Playing career==
Tony Barton won England Schoolboy (1 cap) and Youth (5 caps) honours before beginning his football career with Fulham who he joined as a junior. After a spell on loan to Sutton United, he turned professional with Fulham in May 1954. He went on to score 8 times in 49 games for Fulham.

He moved to Nottingham Forest in December 1959 and after never really establishing himself at Forest, making only 22 appearances (scoring once), moved to Portsmouth in December 1961, where he subsequently became player-coach. After retiring as a player, after 130 games and 34 goals for Portsmouth, he remained on the club&#x27;s coaching staff.

==Coaching and managerial career==
He subsequently joined the coaching staff at Aston Villa, becoming assistant manager to Ron Saunders in 1980. Villa won the League Championship in 1981 (their first league title in 71 years) and Barton was promoted to the manager&#x27;s seat in February 1982 after Saunders resigned.

He guided Villa to victory over Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup Final and followed this up with the 1982 European Super Cup the following season, but their league form (sixth in 1983 and tenth in 1984) did not match their success in Europe and he was sacked in May 1984.

In July 1984, he took over as manager of Northampton Town but left in April 1985 after suffering a heart attack. In September that year he became assistant manager of Southampton under Chris Nicholl, remaining at The Dell until May 1988. He later became assistant manager of Portsmouth and in March 1991 took over as caretaker manager after the sacking of Frank Burrows.

After leaving Portsmouth he was a talent scout for several clubs.
Shortly before Barton&#x27;s death he was offered the first manager&#x27;s job at Wessex League new boys Petersfield Town.

On 20 August 1993, Barton died of a heart attack at the age of 56.

<doc id="1141457" wikidata="Q517281" url="?curid=1141457" title="Leon Taylor">
<text>Leon Taylor (born 2 November 1977) is a former British competitive diver. During his diving career he won medals at all major international events including a silver at the Athens Olympics. Following his retirement from competition, Taylor transitioned to a portfolio of projects. He now speaks about mental wellness, supports the SportsAid charity, teaches yoga and mental wellness, works for an executive performance business and commentates for the BBC.

== Background ==
Taylor was born and educated in Cheltenham where he attended Bournside School.
He was hyperactive as a child and his parents were advised to channel his energies and enthusiasm into sport. He was a swimmer and gymnast from the age of two and took up competitive diving when he was eight. By the age of 11 he was a national champion. He trained at Cheltenham Leisure Centre under Dave Turner and then Ian Barr until 1996.

== Diving career ==
Taylor represented Great Britain at three Summer Olympic Games and was a member of the Great Britain team for 16 years winning medals at all major international championships. In the diving events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, he won the Silver medal in the men&#x27;s synchronised 10-metre platform, with partner Peter Waterfield. It was Britain&#x27;s first Olympic diving medal since Brian Phelps in 1960. He had come fourth in the same competition in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

Other achievements include Silver in the men&#x27;s 10 m platform at the 2002 Commonwealth Games (he had won Bronze in 1998), and Bronze in the 10 m synchro at the 1999 European Aquatics Championships. At a national level, Taylor held both the 10 m platform and 10 m synchro titles from 1994 to 2006.

He trained with other members of the British team in the Ponds Forge swimming complex in Sheffield.

In 1998 Leon invented the &quot;5255b&quot;; a back 2.5 somersaults, 2.5 twists which at the time was the World&#x27;s most difficult dive with a tariff of 3.8. Following a rule change in 2009, the dive now carries a tariff of 3.6.

== Retirement and post-competitive career ==
Although Taylor had been planning to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics, he announced his retirement from competition in May of that year following a number of injuries.

Between 2006 – 2008, he completed an HNC (Higher National Certificate) in Business and Finance from Sheffield Hallam University.
Taylor now works as a public speaker, presenter, conference host, BBC commentator and mentor to members of the British team.

In 2010 Taylor published a book on the subject of mentoring: MENTOR - The most important role you were &quot;never&quot; trained for. This work built on his experience of mentoring many athletes, most notably Olympic medalist Tom Daley.

In January 2013, Taylor was named as a judge on the ITV celebrity diving show &quot;Splash!&quot;. He returned to judge on the show in its second series, airing in 2014. Taylor had planned, and booked, a once-in-a-lifetime trip to New Zealand with his girlfriend when &#x27;Splash&#x27; came about instead.

In 2016 Taylor was part of the BBC commentary team for the diving events at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio and for the 2017 World Aquatics Championships.

In 2018, Taylor spoke at the TEDx Clapham event on the subject of managing prolonged mental stress with the aid of physical movement. He has followed this with a series of videos on the subject of stress.

In March 2020, Taylor led a series of exercise routines for the Headspace mobile app.

Taylor&#x27;s sporting career became the basis of a children&#x27;s story novel, &quot;Leon&#x27;s Magic Mantra&quot;, authored by Sarah Griffiths, who wrote it in collaboration with Taylor by video call during the Covid pandemic. It was launched in June 2022.

== Personal life ==
Taylor has a son, Ziggy, with partner Allie Hill.

<text>The foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus) is a butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae). It is alternatively called the four-eyed butterflyfish. This species is found in the Western Atlantic from Massachusetts, USA and Bermuda to the West Indies and northern South America.

&quot;Chaetodon capistratus&quot; is the type species of &quot;Chaetodon&quot;. If this genus is split up as some have proposed, it will retain its present name like its closest relatives, which include the banded butterflyfish (&quot;C. striatus&quot;) and the spot-finned butterflyfish (&quot;C. ocellatus&quot;).

==Description and ecology==
Foureye butterflyfish are deep-bodied and laterally compressed, with a single dorsal fin and a small mouth with tiny, bristle-like teeth. The body is light grey, sometimes with a yellowish hue, and dark forward-pointing chevrons. The ventral fins are yellow. The species gets its common name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of each side of the body. This spot is surrounded by a brilliant white ring, resembling an eye. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see.

This pattern may result in a predator confusing the back end of the fish for the front end. The foureye butterflyfish&#x27;s first instinct when threatened is to flee, putting the false eye spot closer to the predator than the head. Most predators aim for the eyes, and this false eye spot may in automimicry trick the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. Other potential functions of the eye spot exist. The eye spots are larger and more variable than the real eye and eye spot shape varies from vertically oval in young to more circular in adults. 

These features suggest other possible functions of the eye spot including: intimidating prey, altering predation reaction distances, disorientating predators, serving as a general warning, or for social communication. When escape is not possible, a foureye butterflyfish will sometimes turn to face its aggressor, head lowered and spines fully erect, like a bull about to charge. This may serve to intimidate the other animal or may remind the predator that the butterflyfish is much too spiny to make a comfortable meal.

Foureye butterflyfish usually frequent shallow inshore waters, where they feed on a variety of invertebrates, mainly zoantharians, sea anemones, scleractinians, polychaete worms, gorgonians, tunicates, crustaceans and fish eggs. This fish is known for its uncanny ability to swim in and around coral heads and reefs. They are able to find their way through the most intricate passages by swimming on its side or even upside down. Like its relatives they mate for life and therefore they will often be seen in pairs. They are one of a few fish that mate for life.

<doc id="1141462" wikidata="Q428832" url="?curid=1141462" title="Informix Wingz">
<text>Wingz was a spreadsheet program sold by Informix in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Originally developed for the Macintosh, it was later ported to Microsoft Windows, OS/2, NeXTSTEP and several other commercial flavors of Unix. In spite of many positive reviews, including one calling it &quot;clearly the spreadsheet of the future&quot;, the market was rapidly entrenching Microsoft Excel. Informix eventually gave up on the desktop market and reverted solely to database sales in the mid-1990s. Claris licensed and sold an extensively cleaned up version as Claris Resolve in 1991, but it was far too late to market to have any effect.

==History==
Wingz was originally written solely for the Macintosh by Innovative Software (publishers of the SmartWare Suite on the PC) based in Lenexa within Johnson County, Kansas; and was ready for release in late 1988. Informix wanted to enter the desktop software market with products that could link to their back-end databases, and Wingz seemed like a good fit. They purchased the product and released it largely as-is in early 1989. The release was built up by extensive promotion on the part of Informix, including giving away a then-unprecedented array of &quot;convention swag,&quot; including high quality Wingz red canvas tradeshow bags. For nearly a year, the buildup was focused around the &quot;Wingz Time Shuttle,&quot; an enclosed theatre which traveled MacWorlds in 1988 and 1989. The focal creatives included a video narrated by Leonard Nimoy and automated demos of the product. The video took attendees into &quot;the future of spreadsheet design, past the legacy of failed old products [like Excel]&quot;.

==Features==
The most obvious feature, and the easiest to &quot;checkbox review&quot;, was the size of the spreadsheets Wingz could process. Excel&#x27;s maximum size was 256 columns by 16384 rows, while Wingz could handle spreadsheets up to 32768 in both directions. At the time spreadsheets were still being compared primarily on this feature. A less-obvious feature was that Wingz allowed simple in-cell editing, whereas contemporary versions of Excel forced you to use a separate data-entry bar, a feature also found on Lotus 1-2-3 for Macintosh.

Another clear difference between Wingz and Excel was Wingz&#x27; powerful graphing system, once regarded as the most powerful available in any spreadsheet. Wingz&#x27; graphing system allowed the resulting graphs to be placed directly in the spreadsheets. At the time Excel offered an anemic variety of 2D graphs, and they could only be displayed in a separate view. Unlike the competitors at the time, Wingz also offered 3D graphs. Additionally Wingz made it easy to make the graphs and modify them, allowing you to see your changes in real-time directly in the spreadsheet where the changes were being made. At the time it was an &quot;obvious&quot; feature, but one that no other program had managed to make work correctly.

A more hidden feature was HyperScript, a macro-programming language deliberately modelled on HyperCard&#x27;s HyperTalk. HyperScript allowed even new users to write fairly powerful macros, which could include user-interface features such as buttons and dialog boxes. HyperScript 1.0 was missing some rather obvious features. For instance it could not open another spreadsheet, although it could refer to one if the user opened that for it.

A less hidden &quot;feature&quot; was that the program shipped with a number of bugs, which tainted the release. It also lacked a number of mathematical functions that Excel handled internally, and had no direct importer/exporter for Excel files.

Microsoft responded to the release of Wingz, and others such as Ashton-Tate&#x27;s Full Impact and the Mac version of Lotus 1-2-3 that came out about the same time, by starting an extensive upgrade to Excel. They were soon showing it around claiming it would have all the features of Wingz — in-sheet graphics, large spreadsheets, etc. When it was finally released it was true many of these features were supported, but it was not considered user-friendly.

It was only a short period of time before a Wingz 1.1 release fixed many of these issues, but it was long enough that the product was never able to regain its momentum. It also seemed that Informix never really understood how to market the product, and it is likely &#x27;Not Invented Here&#x27; played a major part in the problems as well — the purchase of Wingz and Smartware prompted Roger Sippl, one of the founders of Informix, to leave the company.

Shortly after Sippl left, Phil White, the new CEO of Informix, announced that Informix would no longer be competing in the desktop application space. Joe Erickson, the lead developer of the Smart Spreadsheet, Wingz, Formula One VBX, Formula One ActiveX, Formula One for Java and SpreadsheetGear for .NET, left shortly after that.

Future releases focused on bringing the product to new platforms as their GUI&#x27;s matured, and adding functionality to HyperScript to allow it to directly interact with databases. Soon it was being marketed primarily as a data access tool, and eventually the name Wingz was dropped and the product became HyperScript Tools. After several years of ignoring it further, it was sold off to Investment Intelligence Systems in the UK. At some unknown point Wingz was bought by a company in San Jose, CA called PDF Solutions which now uses Wingz as a private base for their DataPOWER Semiconductor yield management software packages.

Claris, Apple Computer&#x27;s onetime software arm, licensed Wingz in the early 1990s after Informix lost interest in the Mac market. They updated it slightly with the addition of the Claris-standard UI (toolbars, color palettes, etc.) and released it as Resolve in 1991. By this time Excel was entrenched, and sales of Resolve were tiny. Claris never released a Resolve-MacWrite-Claris Impact bundle, and so were unable to gain a foothold in the high-end market now dominated by Microsoft Office. They eventually cancelled development in 1993, ending sales in 1994.

Claris did offer an &quot;Office suite&quot;, composed of MacWrite Pro, Claris Resolve, and MacDraw Pro. Although this suite didn&#x27;t include a database (e.g., Filemaker Pro) or a dedicated Desktop Presentations application, although MacDraw Pro did provide some such features, they positioned it to compete against MS Office. The ClarisImpact program was released much later than ClarisOffice and was never included as part of the suite.

==Reception==

MacUser in June 1989 gave Wingz 1.0 for Macintosh a 5 mice (out of 5) rating. InfoWorld in December 1989 gave Wingz 1.1 a 7.8 (out of 10) score.

As for the Windows version, InfoWorld gave a 6.8 (out of 10) score in July 1990.

<doc id="1141465" wikidata="Q780348" url="?curid=1141465" title="International Linear Collider">
<text>The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a proposed linear particle accelerator. It is planned to have a collision energy of 500 GeV initially, with the possibility for a later upgrade to 1000 GeV (1 TeV). Although early proposed locations for the ILC were Japan, Europe (CERN) and the USA (Fermilab), the Kitakami highland in the Iwate prefecture of northern Japan has been the focus of ILC design efforts since 2013. The Japanese government is willing to contribute half of the costs, according to the coordinator of study for detectors at the ILC.

The ILC would collide electrons with positrons. It will be between 30 km and 50 km (19–31 mi) long, more than 10 times as long as the 50 GeV Stanford Linear Accelerator, the longest existing linear particle accelerator. The proposal is based on previous similar proposals from Europe, the U.S., and Japan.

In a staged approach, the ILC could initially be constructed at 250 GeV, for use as a Higgs factory. Such a design would be approximately 20 km in length.

Studies for an alternative project, the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) are also underway, which would operate at higher energies (up to 3 TeV) in a machine of length similar to the ILC. These two projects, CLIC and the ILC, have been unified under the Linear Collider Collaboration.

== Background: linacs and synchrotrons ==

There are two basic shapes of accelerators. Linear accelerators (&quot;linacs&quot;) accelerate elementary particles along a straight path. Circular accelerators (&quot;synchrotrons&quot;), such as the Tevatron, the LEP, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), use circular paths. Circular geometry has significant advantages at energies up to and including tens of GeV: With a circular design, particles can be effectively accelerated over longer distances. Also, only a fraction of the particles brought onto a collision course actually collide. In a linear accelerator, the remaining particles are lost; in a ring accelerator, they keep circulating and are available for future collisions. The disadvantage of circular accelerators is that charged particles moving along bent paths will necessarily emit electromagnetic radiation known as synchrotron radiation. Energy loss through synchrotron radiation is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the mass of the particles in question. That is why it makes sense to build circular accelerators for heavy particles—hadron colliders such as the LHC for protons or, alternatively, for lead nuclei. An electron–positron collider of the same size would never be able to achieve the same collision energies. In fact, energies at the LEP which used to occupy the tunnel now given over to the LHC, were limited to 209 GeV by energy loss via synchrotron radiation.

Even though the nominal collision energy at the LHC will be higher than the ILC collision energy (14,000 GeV for the LHC vs. ~500 GeV for the ILC), measurements could be made more accurately at the ILC. Collisions between electrons and positrons are much simpler to analyze than collisions in which the energy is distributed among the constituent quarks, antiquarks and gluons of baryonic particles. As such, one of the roles of the ILC would be making precision measurements of the properties of particles discovered at the LHC.

==ILC physics and detectors==
It is widely expected that effects of physics beyond that described in the current Standard Model will be detected by experiments at the proposed ILC. In addition, particles and interactions described by the Standard Model are expected to be discovered and measured. At the ILC physicists hope to be able to:
* Measure the mass, spin, and interaction strengths of the Higgs boson
* If existing, measure the number, size, and shape of any TeV-scale extra dimensions
* Investigate the lightest supersymmetric particles, possible candidates for dark matter

To achieve these goals, new generation particle detectors are necessary.

== Merging of regional proposals into a worldwide project ==

In August 2004, the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP) recommended a superconducting radio frequency technology for the accelerator. After this decision the three existing linear collider projects – the Next Linear Collider (NLC), the Global Linear Collider (GLC) and Teraelectronvolt Energy Superconducting Linear Accelerator (TESLA) – joined their efforts into one single project (the ILC). In March 2005, the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) announced Prof. Barry Barish, director of the LIGO Laboratory at Caltech from 1997 to 2005, as the Director of the Global Design Effort (GDE). In August 2007, the Reference Design Report for the ILC was released. Physicists working on the GDE completed a detailed ILC design report, publishing it in June 2013.

== Design ==
The electron source for the ILC will use 2-nanosecond laser light pulses to eject electrons from a photocathode, a technique allowing for up to 80% of the electrons to be polarized; the electrons then will be accelerated to 5 GeV in a 370-meter linac stage. Synchrotron radiation from high energy electrons will produce electron-positron pairs on a titanium-alloy target, with as much as 60% polarization; the positrons from these collisions will be collected and accelerated to 5 GeV in a separate linac.

To compact the 5 GeV electron and positron bunches to a sufficiently small size to be usefully collided, they will circulate for 0.1–0.2 seconds in a pair of damping rings, 3.24 km in circumference, in which they will be reduced in size to 6 mm in length and a vertical and horizontal emittance of 2 pm and 0.6 nm, respectively.

From the damping rings the particle bunches will be sent to the superconducting radio frequency main linacs, each 11 km long, where they will be accelerated to 250 GeV. At this energy each beam will have an average power of about 5.3 megawatts. Five bunch trains will be produced and accelerated per second.

To maintain a sufficient luminosity to produce results in a reasonable time frame after acceleration the bunches will be focused to a few nanometers in height and a few hundred nanometers in width. The focused bunches then will be collided inside one of two large particle detectors.

==Proposed sites==
Originally, three sites for the International Linear Collider were leading contenders at established High Energy Physics centers in Europe. At CERN in Geneva the tunnel is located deep underground in non-permeable bedrock. This site was considered favorable for a number of practical reasons but due to the LHC the site was disfavored. At DESY in Hamburg the tunnel is close to the surface in water saturated soil. Germany leads Europe for scientific funding and was therefore considered reliable in terms of funding. At JINR in Dubna the tunnel is close to the surface in non-permeable soil. Dubna has a pre-accelerator complex which could have been easily adapted for the needs for the ILC. But all three were more or less well suited for housing a Linear Collider and one had ample choice for a site selection process in Europe.

Outside Europe a number of countries expressed interest. Japan receives a large amount of funding for neutrino activities, such as the T2K experiment, a factor not in its favor, although 20 huge caverns with access tunnels have already been constructed in Japan for hydroelectric power plants (e.g. the Kannagawa Hydropower Plant). Following the closure of the Tevatron some groups within the USA had expressed interest, with Fermilab being a favored site because of the facilities and experts already present. Much of the speculated interest from other countries was hearsay from within the scientific community, and very few facts were published officially. The information presented above is a summary of that contained in the International Workshop on Linear Colliders 2010 (ECFA-CLIC-ILC Joint Meeting) at CERN.

The 2008 economic crisis led the United States and United Kingdom to cut funds to the collider project, leading to Japan&#x27;s position as the most likely host for the International Linear Collider. On August 23, 2013, the Japanese high-energy physics community&#x27;s site evaluation committee proposed it should be located in the Kitakami Mountains of the Iwate and Miyagi Prefectures. As of March 7, 2019, the Japanese government has stated that it is not ready to support the construction of the Collider due to its high proposed cost of approximately $7 billion. This decision was informed partly by the Science Council of Japan. The Japanese government sought monetary support from other countries to help fund this project.

In 2022, the Japanese plan for the ILC was &quot;shelved&quot; by a panel for Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Several reasons were given, including potentially insufficient international support and the CERN proposal for the Future Circular Collider, which has overlapping physics goals with the ILC.

In March 2024, the &quot;Federation of Diet Members for the ILC&quot; met to receive &quot;Reports on the ILC project&#x27;s progress and initiatives by relevant organizations&quot;. Fifty participants, including Diet members and other government agencies, as well as researchers and businesses, received reports on the project&#x27;s progress. Participants discussed the ILC&#x27;s future. The meeting resulted in three recommendations:

==Cost==
The Reference Design Report estimated the cost of building the ILC, excluding R&amp;D, prototyping, land acquisition, underground easement costs, detectors, contingencies, and inflation, at US$6.75 billion (in 2007 prices). From formal project approval, completion of the accelerator complex and detectors is expected to require seven years. The host country would be required to pay $1.8 billion for site-specific costs like digging tunnels and shafts and supplying water and electricity.

Former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu estimated the total cost to be US$25 billion. ILC Director Barish said this is likely to be an overestimate. Other Department of Energy officials have estimated a $20 billion total. Upon completion of the 2013 ILC Design Report, Barish said the cost of building the ILC was the equivalent of 7.78 billion 2012 U.S. dollars; it will require &quot;22.6 million hours of labor and location-specific costs including site preparation, scientific detectors and facility operations.&quot;

<text>Antonio Núñez Tena (born 15 January 1979) is a Spanish retired professional footballer who played as a right midfielder.

His early career included spells at Real Madrid and Liverpool, on the fringes of both teams. Much of the rest of his career was spent in the Segunda División, while he also played three years for Apollon Limassol in Cyprus.

==Club career==
===Real Madrid===
Born in Madrid, Núñez started his career with CD San Federico, before joining Tercera División team CD Las Rozas. In 2001 he moved to Real Madrid, his favourite club growing up.

Courtesy of manager Carlos Queiroz, Núñez was promoted to the main squad for the 2003–04 season. On 2 September 2003, in his La Liga debut, he came on as a substitute for Javier Portillo 15 minutes from time in an away game against Villarreal CF and scored the 1–1 equaliser after just seven minutes; for the remainder of the campaign, however, in which the &quot;Merengues&quot; came up totally empty, he only made a further ten league appearances, all from the bench.

===Liverpool===
In August 2004, Núñez was transferred to Liverpool, becoming Rafael Benítez&#x27;s second signing as manager – after compatriot Josemi – as part of an exchange deal that saw Michael Owen go in the opposite direction for £8 million. He injured his knee in his first day of training for the Reds, and was out of action for three months. He made his Premier League debut on 28 November, playing 21 minutes in a 2–1 win over Arsenal.

Núñez scored his first and only goal for Liverpool in the 3–2 loss against Chelsea in the final of the Football League Cup, therefore becoming the only player in the club&#x27;s history to score his only goal for the team in a major cup final. In his only season, he also won a UEFA Champions League medal, as he was one of the substitutes in the final against A.C. Milan (although he did not play).

===Celta and later years===
Following a disappointing season, Núñez transferred back to Spain and joined newly-promoted side RC Celta de Vigo on 26 July 2005. During his three-year spell with the Galicians, where he would be heavily played, he also lived one top-flight relegation, and joined Real Murcia in the summer of 2008.

In August 2009, Núñez bought out the remainder of his Murcia contract and was released, shortly after joining Cyprus&#x27; Apollon Limassol FC. After three seasons, he returned to his country and its Segunda División, signing a one-and-a-half-year deal with SD Huesca. After the team&#x27;s relegation in 2013, he remained in the division by agreeing to a four-month contract at Deportivo de La Coruña on 12 September; he was part of the squad that returned to the top tier after one year, but started only seven matches and did not score once.

On 8 July 2014, Núñez signed a one-year deal at Recreativo de Huelva, scoring five times in his first season as the team descended to Segunda División B. In April 2016, he spoke to &quot;Diario AS&quot; about the club&#x27;s financial emergency that was threatening its existence.

<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch P11 is an underwater firearm developed in 1976 by Heckler &amp; Koch. It is loaded using a pepper-box-like assembly, containing five sealed barrels each containing an electrically-fired projectile. Two styles of barrel assembly can be used: one containing five 7.62×36mm flechette darts for use underwater, or five 133-grain bullets for use above water.

==Design==
Since ordinary-shaped rounds are inaccurate and have a very short range when used underwater, this pistol fires steel darts underwater or traditional bullets above water. It has five barrels, each of which is loaded with a cartridge, giving the gun a pepper-box appearance, and it is electrically ignited from a battery pack in the pistol grip.

Both the underwater dart and above-water bullet barrel assemblies use a sabot to hold the projectile. Each barrel is rifled in two portions: an initial large diameter designed to spin the sabot and projectile, and a second, narrower section to halt the sabot and spin the projectile. This has two principal benefits: first, it reduces the noise produced when the weapon is fired and second it reduces exhaust gas released by the weapon that would otherwise cause bubbles.

After firing all five cartridges, the barrel unit must be sent back to its manufacturer for reloading. It is very similar to its predecessor, the Mk 1 Underwater Defense Gun. In the past, Heckler &amp; Koch has denied knowledge of its existence.

This firearm is somewhat bulkier than its Soviet counterpart, the SPP-1 underwater pistol, but it has five barrels, as opposed to the Soviet firearm which has four. However, the SPP-1 does not need to be sent back to the manufacturer to be reloaded.

<text>Culture Beat is a German Eurodance project formed in 1989 by Torsten Fenslau. The act has gone through a number of lineup changes over the years; they achieved the most success whilst fronted by singer Tania Evans and rapper Jay Supreme. Their 1993 single &quot;Mr. Vain&quot; was a number-one hit in eleven European countries, and the act claims to have sold more than 10 million records worldwide.

==Biography==
===Origins and formation===
Torsten Fenslau, who initially had a desire for becoming an architect, had been working as a DJ at the Frankfurt nightclub Dorian Gray since 1982 (and remained for 11 years), when in 1989 he decided to form Culture Beat with his friends Jens Zimmermann and Peter Zweier.

===1989–1991: &quot;Horizon&quot;===
Their first single, the track &quot;Der Erdbeermund&quot;, with a spoken vocal in German by Jo van Nelsen, peaked at number 11 on the German singles chart. Versions in English and French were also released (titled &quot;Cherry Lips&quot; and &quot;Les lèvres cerises&quot;, respectively). An instrumental version was also played in clubs in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 55.

Shortly afterwards, Culture Beat recruited American, New Jersey-born rapper Jay Supreme and singer Lana Earl to front the act. While the second single &quot;I Like You&quot; reached number 22 in the Netherlands, their fourth single &quot;No Deeper Meaning&quot; managed to reach as high as number 4 in the Netherlands and number 3 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Dance Chart. They released their first album, &quot;Horizon&quot;, in 1991 which went with only minor success.

===1993–1994: &quot;Serenity&quot; and international success===
Lana was replaced by British singer Tania Evans in 1993, and the act took a harder Eurodance sound. &quot;Mr. Vain&quot; became their biggest hit to date, reaching number one in 13 countries including Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom. It was also their first mainstream hit in the United States, peaking at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single was certified three times Gold in Germany for selling over 750,000 units, it also managed to reach a Gold status in several other countries including US.

Subsequent singles &quot;Got to Get It&quot; and &quot;Anything&quot; were also pan-European hits, and their second album &quot;Serenity&quot; was awarded at the ECHO award for being the &quot;Best-selling German Act Abroad&quot;, with more than two million copies sold. This also got Torsten Fenslau nominated in the same year at the Echo for being the &quot;Best Producer of the Year&quot;, who also walked away as a winner.

On 6 November 1993, Culture Beat&#x27;s founder Torsten Fenslau was killed in a car accident in Messel (district of Darmstadt) aged 29. His brother Frank took over the act as a manager.

===1995–1996: &quot;Inside Out&quot;===
The group returned the act in 1995 with a third album called &quot;Inside Out&quot;, preceded by a single of the same title &quot;Inside Out&quot; which reached number 5 in Germany and number 32 in the UK.
A total of four singles were released from the album. Inside Out is the latest album released by Jay Supreme and Tanya Evans. This is also the first album not produced by Torsten Fenslau.

===1997–1998: Major changes and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;===
In 1997, Frank Fenslau decided to take Culture Beat in a different musical direction diverging the act from the Eurodance sound into a more commercial pop sound. He also replaced Tania with Kim Sanders, who had previously scored a hit with &quot;Impossible&quot; by Captain Hollywood Project. Jay Supreme remained with the act for a short time after Tania&#x27;s departure, but during recording of the next album he decided to leave the group and the few rap vocals on the next album were produced by rapper &quot;Next Up&quot;. Although, in 1998, the album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; managed to reach number 12 at home, it was a minor chart success as it remained in the top 20 of the album chart for only four weeks, and spent overall 10 weeks appearing on the chart.

===2001–present: Singles and present status===
Three years later, Jacky Sangster replaced Kim as the fourth female lead singer for Culture Beat. The single called &quot;Insanity&quot; was released in 2001 which flopped in Germany; however, reached number 1 in Israel. In 2003, to commemorate ten years since the release of the group&#x27;s biggest hit, a new version of &quot;Mr. Vain&quot; was issued in Germany and reached number 7 in the singles chart. In 2004, a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package was released ahead of a planned new album with Jacky as vocalist called &quot;Obsession&quot;, but was canceled before &quot;Can&#x27;t Go on Like This (No No)&quot; was released. This single had minor success as well. &quot;Your Love&quot; was released in 2008, and is Culture Beat&#x27;s most recent single to date. Jacky and a male rapper known by the stage name MC 4T (according to the official website) have performed as Culture Beat since 2003 and continue to perform at different 90&#x27;s revival venues around the world.

In January 2013, a compilation album was released, &quot;The Loungin&#x27; Side of&quot;, which contains acoustic and lounge versions of hits taken from &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;.

<doc id="1141476" wikidata="Q595582" url="?curid=1141476" title="IAI Heron">
<text>The IAI Heron (Machatz-1) is a medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by the Malat
(UAV) division of Israel Aerospace Industries. It is capable of Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) operations of up to 52 hours&#x27; duration at up to 10.5 km (35,000 ft). It has demonstrated 52 hours of continuous flight, but the effective operational maximal flight duration is less, according to payload and flight profile. An advanced version, the Heron TP, is also known as the IAI Eitan.

On 11 September 2005, it was announced that the Israel Defense Forces purchased US$50 million worth of Heron systems.

==Design and development==
The Heron navigates using an internal GPS navigation device, and either a pre-programmed flight profile (in which case the system is fully autonomous from takeoff to landing), manual override from a ground control station, or a combination of both. It can autonomously return to base and land in case of lost communication with the ground station. The system has fully automatic launch and recovery (ALR) and all-weather capabilities.

The Heron can carry an array of sensors, including thermographic camera (infrared) and visible-light airborne ground surveillance, intelligence systems (COMINT and ELINT) and various radar systems, totaling up to . The Heron is also capable of target acquisition and artillery adjustment.

The payload sensors communicate with the ground control station in real time, using either direct line of sight data link, or via an airborne/satellite relay. Like the navigation system, the payload can also be used in either a fully pre-programmed autonomous mode, or manual real-time remote operation, or a combination of both.

===Super Heron===
At the February 2014 Singapore Air Show, IAI unveiled the Super Heron refinement of the Heron UAS. The Super Heron has a 200-horsepower diesel engine that increases its rate of climb and performance. Its range is line-of-sight and by satellite control. Endurance is 45 hours at a maximum altitude of . Cruising speed is and top speed over .

== Operational history ==

The Heron saw significant use during Operation Cast Lead in Gaza of 2008–2009. During the deployment, each brigade combat team was assigned a UAV squadron for close support. This was the first Israeli operation in which UAVs, helicopters, and fighter jets were allocated to ground forces directly without IAF central command authorizing sorties. Air-support controller teams operated alongside brigade commanders at the front emphasizing the brigade commander&#x27;s utilization of direct air assets. A high degree of situational awareness was achieved by maintaining at least a dozen UAVs in flight over Gaza at all times. Aerial surveillance was provided by Heron and Hermes 450 UAVs and Apache attack helicopters. Along with coordination between the air force and ground troops, Israeli ground forces were able to utilize cooperation with the Israel Security Agency by having operatives attached to the forward units. This inter-service coordination allowed for a higher level of tactical awareness and the ability to strike time-critical targets.

Other countries operating the Heron include Singapore, India and Turkey. France operates a derivative of Heron named Eagle or Harfang. In 2008, Canada announced a plan to lease a Heron for use in Afghanistan, starting in 2009. In mid-2009, Australia leased two Herons as part of a multimillion-dollar lease to operate the vehicles in Afghanistan. In early July 2013, the Heron reached 15,000 flight hours over Afghanistan. Australia concluded its use of the Heron in support of Operation Slipper in Afghanistan on 30 November 2014, after it had accumulated 27,000 flight hours. Royal Australian Air Force retired two Herons in June 2017.

Beginning in 2021, Malta-based Herons have been used by Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, to monitor migrant activity in the southern Mediterranean Sea. This activity drew controversy when it was announced that the data gathered would be shared with countries including Libya and Tunisia. The concern was that the data could be used to force irregular migrants back to their point of departure, denying them the opportunity to seek asylum in other countries.

=== India ===
The Indian Armed Forces initially purchased 12 Heron drones along with Searcher drones from IAI in 2002. The purchase was as a result of the report from the Kargil Review Committee. However, the satisfactory performance of the drone during the multiple search and rescue missions after 2004 tsunami led to planning of an additional order of 50 Heron UAVs. Though the contract negotiations were over by 2004 end, the contract signing was delayed to 2005 due to Lok Sabha elections. The contract was worth $220 million. The drone costs per unit.

In case of the Indian Army, the drones were initially deployed by the Regiment of Artillery for target acquisition roles to assist artillery units. However, after the 2020 China-India standoff, the Heron units of the Eastern Command were moved to Army Aviation Corps by August 2021 and the routine surveillance sorties per day were doubled. This move was done to allow the drones to take part in wide range of operations. Post reorganisation, the Heron UAVs were placed under the Army Aviation Brigade at Missamari, Assam which includes three squadrons. Each squadron has one RPA flight equipped with Herons. Three flights included a total of 14 UAVs of the Eastern Command.

==== Additional purchase ====
On 14 July 2020, reports indicated that the Indian Air Force intended to purchase additional units of Heron Mk1 UAVs to complement the existing fleet. The quantity was not revealed.

==== Project Cheetah ====
Project Cheetah was a programme of the Indian Armed Forces to upgrade and weaponise their existing fleet of around 90 Heron UAVs.

The project gain fast-track approval from the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) on 14 July 2021. Around 90 drones were to be upgraded with satellite communication (SATCOM), advanced reconnaissance equipment and ability to fire laser-guided bombs, air-launched anti-tank guided missiles and other precision-guided munitions. The programme will cost around . The cost negotiation was completed a year ago. After this, the proposal would be sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security for final approval.

On 19 September 2022, it was reported that the upgrades will be carried out by manufacturing units of Indian firms with assistance from Israel. In the current variant, the equipment of the UAVs include thermographic camera, airborne ground surveillance, visible light, radar systems, etc. Th project was reportedVs were expected to undergo upgrades in two phases. In the first phase, &quot;in the last stage of decision-making&quot;.

The UAVs were to be upgraded in two phases. In the first phase, the SATCOM and sensor suite was upgradation would be carried out. SATCOM capability would enhance the range to unlimited of the UAVs which is restricted to the within visual range of . However, in 2023, it was reported that India has dropped plans to arm the Heron drones in the Armed Forces and the other upgrades would be carried out within India. The report stated that the airspace that India has to fight in is heavily contested and is not very suitable for drone warfare.

==== Heron Mk2 ====
It was reported in May 2021 that Indian Army was negotiating with IAI to lease 4 units of Heron TP UAVs under the emergency procurement powers of the Armed Forces. The drones would be leased for three years and 2 of the drones would arrive by August. The advanced variants of the drone will have automatic taxi-takeoff and landing (ATOL) and SATCOM systems. However, after contract signing, it was corrected that the drones would not be leased but purchased and the variant is Heron Mk2. A total of 10 Heron Mk2 have been ordered including 4 units for Army and 6 units for the Air Force.

Two of the UAVs were inducted by the Indian Army in November 2022 and deployed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) at Leh, Ladakh. The rest of the 2 units were inducted in Northeast India by September-end the same year.

In August 2023, Indian Air Force inducted 4 Heron Mk2. The drone squadron, nicknamed the &quot;Wardens of the North&quot;, was deployed in the northern sector under the commissioning Commanding Officer Wing Commander Pankaj Rana. In November 2023, the Indian Air Force placed an order for two more Heron Mk2 UAVs in addition to the current four by using emergency procurement powers.

==== Crashes ====
As of 2024, India lost 12 Heron Mk1 UAVs since it was inducted into service in 2002. The crashes is attributed to several reasons like human errors, engine failures as well as loss of contact with Ground Control Stations (GCS).
* In November 2005, it was reported that after induction of Heron UAVs in 2002 at least four UAVs were lost within 2 years. The first instance of the crash occurred in 2003 on a forward airbase in Rajasthan. While one of the crashes was attributed to human error, the others were due to technical issues and included the death of an IAF handler. Two drones of Army and Air Force each were lost.
* On 26 November 2014, a Heron UAV operated by the Indian Air Force crashed in the Mankunva village, around from Bhuj of Kutch district, Gujarat.
* On 9 January 2015, a Heron UAV of the IAF crashed in Akoda village, north west of Barmer district, Rajasthan. The crash was due to engine failure after taking off from Jaisalmer AFS. There were no damage to life or property.
* On 18 March 2016, a Heron UAV of the INAS 342 squadron of the Indian Navy suffered an engine failure during a routine surveillance mission near the Kerala coast and had to be ditched into sea in a controlled manner. Later, parts of aircraft including the engine was recovered. The Navy has around 10 Herons.
* On 7 December 2017, a Heron UAV of the Indian Army was lost in a cross-border crash during a routine training mission. While being operated near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) over the Indian territory in the Sikkim sector, the UAV lost contact with its Ground Control Station mid-flight and veered off the course into Tibet and crashed. The wreckage was recovered by Chinese troops. The event occurred after the Doklam standoff. The UAV was equipped with sensitive Israeli-origin sensors to detect presence of troops, vehicles, airborne radars and track distant movements. The payload lost weighed .

* 25 April 2024, an IAF Heron crash in Dhani Jajoya village, which is from Jaisalmer, Rajasthan.

== Heron variants ==
*Turkey operates a special variant of the Heron, which utilizes Turkish-designed and manufactured electro-optical subsystems. For example, the Turkish Herons use the ASELFLIR-300T airborne thermal Imaging and targeting system designed and manufactured by ASELSAN of Turkey. The Turkish Herons also have stronger engines in order to compensate for the added payload created by the heavier ASELFLIR-300T. This is the same FLIR system currently used in the TAI/AgustaWestland T129 attack helicopter and also the TAI Anka MALE UAV. IAI staff maintain that the Turkish Heron&#x27;s &quot;with its enhanced performance, is better than all existing Heron UAVs operating worldwide&quot;. Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ) provides maintenance and overhaul services for its Herons.

<text>Bo Martin Erik Erikson (born 27 August 1965), better known by his stage name E-Type, is a Swedish Eurodance musician, songwriter and record producer. His professional name is based on the Jaguar E-Type sports car.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Erikson was born in Uppsala. His father is Bo (&quot;Bosse&quot;) G. Erikson (b. 1933), known as the host of the science TV-show &quot;Vetenskapens Värld&quot; (World of Science) on SVT. His mother&#x27;s name was Elisabeth and he has one sibling, a sister Erika. His mother died of cancer in 1987.

In his teens, E-Type and his family moved to Bromma, a borough in the western part of Stockholm, and he is currently living in the heart of Stockholm. He started his musical career in the 1980s as a drummer in the speed metal bands Maninnya Blade and Hexenhaus. In 1991 he met up with Stakka Bo with two singles as a result of the partnership: &quot;We Got the Atmosphere&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Numania 1&quot; in 1992. This earned E-Type a job as a VJ on ZTV. His first solo single, &quot;I&#x27;m Falling&quot; was released in mid-1993 but did poorly commercially.

===Success===
E-Type&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1994 with the collaboration with the producers from Cheiron (Denniz PoP, Max Martin, and Amadin) on his debut album &quot;Made in Sweden&quot;. A single from this album, &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot;, reached gold status in Sweden, #1 on the Swedish dance chart, #2 on the Swedish sale chart, and #4 in Israel. Eventually four other singles were released from the album: the ballad &quot;Do You Always (Have To Be Alone)?&quot;, &quot;This Is the Way&quot; and &quot;Russian Lullaby&quot; (co-written by Jonas Berggren from Ace of Base). &quot;This Is the Way&quot; reached #15 on the Billboard Club Chart in the United States and #6 on the UK Club Chart. Most of the tracks feature the female vocalist Nana Hedin, who is featured on nearly all of E-Type&#x27;s albums. The album itself was released on 31 October 1994 and reached #2 on the album-chart. Over 100,000 copies were sold in Sweden and the album was listed for 26 weeks.

During 1996, E-Type and the producer-team spent their time working on a second album &quot;The Explorer&quot;, which was released in Sweden on 23 October. The album sold more than 20,000 copies. His third album, &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, was released on 27 November 1998 and went to #1 in Finland and Sweden, going double platinum and platinum respectively. The album remains E-Type&#x27;s best-selling album with sales of 3 million copies worldwide and includes hit singles like &quot;Angels Crying&quot;, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Princess of Egypt&quot;.

E-Type recorded the official song, &quot;Campione 2000&quot; for the 2000 European football championship. &quot;Campione 2000&quot; is played every time the English football team Bolton Wanderers take to the field. In 2001, he released his new single &quot;Life&quot; on 12 November. The forthcoming album release, entitled &quot;Euro IV Ever&quot;, was postponed until the end of 2001 and finally released on 21 November. An album release party was held on 25 November.

Max Martin, Rami and E-Type produced the album &quot;Loud Pipes Save Lives&quot; in 2004, and released it on 25 March. It&#x27;s so far the last E-Type album to feature Nana Hedin on vocals. At the beginning of April, &quot;Paradise&quot; reached #11 in Finland and entered the Finnish Dance chart at position #28. On 14 May 2007 E-Type released a new single called &quot;True Believer&quot;. There was also a new album in 2007, &quot;Eurotopia&quot;, released on 31 October. The album mainly features E-Type&#x27;s new female vocalist, Sanne Karlsson.

In the spring of 2008, E-Type appeared in Melodifestivalen 2008 and performed the song &quot;Line of Fire&quot; together with the rock band The Poodles. They advanced to a second chance heat, which was held in Kiruna on 8 March when they lost to Sibel.

The UK record label All Around the World released &quot;True Believer&quot; to the UK market in late 2008, and in mid-2009, &quot;Rain&quot; from &quot;Loud Pipes Save Lives&quot; was unexpectedly released as a single and music video. In August 2009, a promo single and a new music video for &quot;Life&quot; was released, with newly shot scenes of Nana Hedin intermixed with the original 2001 video.

E-Type released the single &quot;Back 2 Life&quot; in January 2011. &quot;Back 2 Life&quot; was written by E-Type &amp; Johan &quot;Shellback&quot; Schuster and Savan Kotecha (Usher, Celine Dion, Leona Lewis and more) who wrote the lyrics. The producers are Max Martin &amp; Shellback, Şerban Ghenea (Eminem, Kesha, Justin Timberlake and more) who mixed the track.

For gym-goers, E-Type&#x27;s music has become synonymous with Les Mills International&#x27;s group fitness class BodyPump. The structure, lyrical content and soaring crescendos suit well the &quot;back track&quot; of the class. E-Type tracks used in this context include &quot;Africa&quot;, &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot;, &quot;Eurofighter&quot;, &quot;True Believer&quot; and &quot;The Tide&quot;.

==Vocalists==
The music of E-Type follows the typical Eurodance formula of synthesizer music built up to a dance floor crescendo, accompanied by his own vocals, and a chorus sung by Nana Hedin (who appeared in the music videos for &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot; and the 2009 re-release of &quot;Life&quot;). Hedin provided vocals for more than half of all E-Type&#x27;s songs. She made her last appearance on record with E-Type on his 2004 album &quot;Loud Pipes Save Lives&quot;. In 2009 she was told by doctors that she has cancer in her tongue and she is therefore currently not performing. E-Type&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Eurotopia&quot;, featured his new vocalist, Sanne Karlsson.

During E-Type&#x27;s success in the 1990s, dancer Dilnarin &quot;Dee&quot; Demirbag performed in concerts and music videos by lip-syncing to Hedin&#x27;s vocals. She is featured in several of E-Type&#x27;s music videos such as &quot;This is the Way&quot;, &quot;Calling Your Name&quot;, &quot;Angels Crying&quot;, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;, and appeared on TV shows and concerts. &quot;Dee&quot; left the band in 2001 to pursue a solo career. However, she got back together with E-Type in December 2006 for a concert in Russia, and is still touring with the band occasionally. She also appeared in the 2007 music video for &quot;True Believer&quot;.

==Awards==
E-Type participated in the Swedish Dance Music Awards in March 1995. He won three awards: Best Song, Best Artist and Newcomer. In 1999, E-Type was nominated for a Swedish Grammy in the category &#x27;Modern Dance&#x27;, along with Dr. Bombay, Richi M and Black Moses.

==Personal life==

As of spring of 2022, E-Type is in a relationship with Melinda Jacobs (born in 1984), known as the foster mother of the late Lilla hjärtat (English translation: &quot;Little Heart&quot;). On August 21, 2022, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child together, due in January 2023. This will be the first child of E-Type since he does not have any children of his own, while this will be Jacobs&#x27; fourth biological child along with all of her foster children, which she has taken on over the years.

<text>Karben is a town in the Wetteraukreis, in Hessen, Germany. It is situated on the banks of the river Nidda in the Rhein-Main-Gebiet (Rhine-Main area), approximately north of Frankfurt.

==Division of the town==
Karben as a unified town was founded in 1970, comprising some smaller villages (Klein-Karben, Gross-Karben, Okarben, Kloppenheim, Rendel, Burg-Gräfenrode, and Petterweil).

==Infrastructure==
Karben has two railway stations (Groß Karben and Okarben) on the Main–Weser Railway and is served by line S6 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. It has access to the A 661 autobahn and federal highway B3. The town hall is located in a newer district of Gross-Karben, as is a public swimming pool. The industrial district west of Gross- and Klein-Karben hosts several companies of national and international stature.

==History==
The village of Okarben was once location of a Roman
military castellum, forming a part of the limes, the Roman imperial border defence network and Karben’s mineral springs have been used by the Romans some 2000 years ago. Rendel, Karben’s oldest borough, was mentioned first in 774 in a deed of donation to the monastery of Lorch. Kloppenheim once belonged to an installation of the “Deutschen Orden” (Teutonic Knights Order), who maintained a small palace there. Gross-Karben hosts two more manors which were inhabited by local landlords. The “Degenfeld’sche Schloss” contains today Karben’s Museum on agriculture and local history. Gross-Karben, Klein-Karben, Okarben, Burg-Graefenrode and Rendel still have churches dating back from the Baroque period.
Okarben experienced a face-change in the 19th century, when it started hosting workers for the newly established Main-Weser Railroad between Frankfurt and Kassel. The city has transformed itself from a bundle of independent villages living mostly of farming the rich soils of the Wetterau to a slowly integrating city providing housing for a growing population of commuters and space for several small and mid-sized enterprises, while maintaining much of its original rural charm.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Karben is twinned with:
* Ramonville-Saint-Agne, France
* Saint-Égrève, France (1974)
* Luisenthal, Germany (1992)
* Krnov, Czech Republic (1993)

<doc id="1141483" wikidata="Q511332" url="?curid=1141483" title="Bonjour Tristesse (1958 film)">
<text>Bonjour Tristesse (French &quot;Hello, Sadness&quot;) is a 1958 British-American Technicolor film in CinemaScope, directed and produced by Otto Preminger from a screenplay by Arthur Laurents based on the novel of the same name by Françoise Sagan. The film stars Deborah Kerr, David Niven, Jean Seberg, Mylène Demongeot and Geoffrey Horne, and features Juliette Gréco, Walter Chiari, Martita Hunt and Roland Culver. It was released by Columbia Pictures. This film had color and black-and-white sequences, a technique unusual for the 1950s, but widely used in silent movies and early sound movies.

==Plot==
Cécile is a wealthy, free-spirited, idiosyncratic young woman. While she loves her playboy father Raymond dearly (and he loves her dearly), she is bored by suitors and the activities that interest them. While dancing to a performance of &quot;Bonjour Tristesse,&quot; she wonders if she will ever find happiness again after what happened a year ago when she was 17 that summer on the French Riviera. The rest of the film chronicles the events of that summer in flashback.

Cécile and Raymond are enjoying their vacation on the Riviera, the latter&#x27;s latest mistress being Elsa, a flighty, superficial, vain woman. Cécile meets another vacationer, Philippe, a mysterious but attractive young law student, and the two quickly take a liking to one another. One evening, Raymond receives a letter from Anne, an older woman, a dress designer, and a friend of Raymond&#x27;s late wife, who will be staying at the villa. Anne and Raymond become close, but Cécile finds that Anne threatens to reform the undisciplined way of life that she has shared with her father.

Despite his promises of fidelity to Anne, Raymond cannot give up his playboy life. Helped by Elsa, Raymond&#x27;s young and flighty mistress, Cécile does her best to break up the relationship with Anne. The combination of the daughter&#x27;s disdain and the father&#x27;s rakishness drives Anne to a tragic end.

==Cast==
==Critical reception==
The film met with a lukewarm critical reception at the time. The BFI&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote &quot;The best performance is David Niven&#x27;s; he gives his part a pathetic touch that the writing never attains. Jean Seberg, who speaks rather than acts her lines, turns in the least effective performance. &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; is an elegant, ice cold, charade of emotions, completely artificial and eventually torpid.&quot; Others enjoyed it rather more and it had some unexpected fans. François Truffaut described Seberg as &quot;The best actress in Europe&quot;. Jean-Luc Godard said &quot;The character played by Jean Seberg (in &quot;Breathless&quot;) was a continuation of her role in &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot;, I could have taken the last shot of Preminger&#x27;s film and started after dissolving to a title: &quot;Three years later&quot;. An article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in 2012 described it as &quot;an example of Hollywood&#x27;s golden age, and both its star and its famously tyrannical director are ripe for rediscovery.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann described &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; as tedious.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie has an approval rating 88% based on reviews from 24 critics. Critic Keith Uhlich of &quot;Time Out New York&quot; wrote: &quot;the director uses the expansive CinemaScope frame and his eye for luxuriant, clinical &quot;mise en scène&quot; to soberly probe rather than gleefully prod. The cast is across-the-board exemplary. Niven and Kerr keenly satirize their onscreen iconographies—the cad and the goody-goody, respectively—but it&#x27;s Seberg who cuts deepest.&quot;

=== Trivia ===
Mylène Demongeot declared in a 2015 filmed interview: &quot;David Niven was like a Lord, he was part of those great actors who were extraordinary like Dirk Bogarde, individuals with lots of class, elegance and humour. I only saw David get angry once. Preminger had discharged him for the day but eventually asked to get him. I said, sir, you had discharged him, he left for Deauville to gamble at the casino. So we rented a helicopter so they immediately went and grabbed him. Two hours later, he was back, full of rage. There I saw David lose his British phlegm, his politeness and class. It was royal. [Laughs].&quot;
