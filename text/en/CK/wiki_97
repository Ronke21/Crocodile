<text>is a 1989 beat &#x27;em up video game developed and published by Sega for arcades, running on the Sega System 16B arcade hardware. Makoto Uchida was the lead designer of the game, and was also responsible for the creation of the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Altered Beast&quot;. The game casts players as one of three warriors who must free the fantastical land of Yuria from the tyrannical rule of Death Adder, who wields the titular Golden Axe.

The game was well received at the time of release, &quot;Golden Axe&quot; was later converted for play on many different home systems, including Sega&#x27;s own Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System. The game&#x27;s success spawned an entire franchise consisting of several sequels and various spin-offs.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King of Yuria and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue the King and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. The second is a barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding Amazonian, Tyris Flare, whose parents were both murdered by Death Adder.

The warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Mega Drive/Genesis and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder&#x27;s mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality.

The arcade release of the game concludes with a fourth wall-breaking end sequence with three children playing a &quot;Golden Axe&quot; arcade system in a closed arcade casino. The arcade game shorts-out and causes an electrical fire, which magically causes all the characters from within the game pour out into the &quot;real world&quot;, and begin chasing the kids out of the building, while the three warriors that were the last to exit the arcade, run in hot pursuit to rescue them.

==Gameplay==
Progress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder&#x27;s henchmen, including men armed with clubs and maces, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of &quot;bars&quot; of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue &quot;magic potions&quot; attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different maximum number of magic bars and varying ranges of attack.

Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice (which also appeared in &quot;Altered Beast&quot;), which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire depending on its colour scheme, is found later in the game.

In certain areas, skeleton swordsmen emerge from the ground, like in the film &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;.

In addition to the main quest, some home versions of the game included &quot;duel mode&quot;, a survival mode type game that pitted players against increasingly powerful foes in consecutive rounds of play. This mode also featured a two-player one-on-one option.

==Development==
Lead designer and producer Makoto Uchida was fond of action movies, particularly the &quot;Conan&quot; films, and wanted to create a game influenced by them. He said that the development team for the game was small and development of the game took about a year. Uchida&#x27;s &quot;idea was to come up with a &quot;Double Dragon&quot; that was not a &quot;Double Dragon&quot;… Technos was an experienced rival who had been working on the &quot;Kunio-Kun&quot; series, so there was no way we could compete if we did the same thing as them. I had a feeling that arcade games should be competitive against the great hit console title &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; (created by Enix) and therefore studied the world of magic and swords, combined this with the gameplay of &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, and finally came up with the concept of &quot;Golden Axe&quot;.&quot; Uchida also cited the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987) as an influence, particularly how players could combine button moves and stick presses to perform individual attacks.

==Ports==
The Mega Drive/Genesis version remained largely faithful to the arcade game, adding a level and a duel mode, along with a new ending.

The IBM PC compatible port released in 1990 is similar to the Mega Drive/Genesis version, but includes a 256-colour VGA mode as well as support for EGA, CGA, and Hercules modes. Atari ST and Amiga ports released in late 1990 by Virgin Software are similar to the arcade. The Amiga port is similar to the arcade game, with some palette changes and without parallax scrolling.

Variations of the original game have also been released. The Master System version of the game retells the original story from the perspective of Tarik, a barbarian with resemblances to Ax Battler (much like all the other barbarian in the entire series: Kain Grinder, Stern Blade and Kain Blade). While the game is only one-player, it features all of the levels and magic powers of the arcade version. In Japan, &quot;Golden Axe&quot; was released by Telenet for the PC Engine CD-ROM in 1990 with high-quality resampled music and cut scenes.

==Reception==

===Commercial===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Golden Axe&quot; on their 1 July 1989 issue as being the second most successful table arcade cabinet of the month. It went on to be the 18th highest-grossing arcade game of 1989 in Japan. In the United States, it was the highest-grossing arcade game of January 1990.

The ZX Spectrum version went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. The Xbox Live Arcade digital version of &quot;Golden Axe&quot; sold 167,935 units on the Xbox 360 console, .

===Accolades===
Upon release of the home conversions, the game received the &quot;&quot;C+VG&quot; Hit!&quot; award from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, the &quot;Star Buy&quot; award from &quot;The One for Amiga Games&quot;, the &quot;&quot;Zero&quot; Console Classic&quot; award from &quot;Zero&quot; magazine, and a Gold Medal from &quot;Zzap!64&quot; magazine.

In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; named &quot;Golden Axe&quot; one of the 50 best computer games ever, describing it as &quot;deliciously animated hacking, slashing and generally whaling&quot;. In 1993, the ZX Spectrum version of the game was voted number 60 in the &quot;Your Sinclair Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In 1995, Flux magazine rated the Mega Drive version 70th in their &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the Mega Drive version 100th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot; 

===Retrospective===
Reviewing the game&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Sega Arcade Classics&quot; for the Sega CD in 1993, Glenn Rubenstein commented that the game had become outdated in the years since its original release.

Retrospectively, GameRankings gave the Sega Genesis version an aggregate rating of 69% based on six reviews published online in the 2000s. Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version an aggregate rating of 68 out of 100.

&quot;TouchArcade&quot; rated the iOS version 3.5 out of 5 stars.

==Releases==

The Mega Drive/Genesis version was later released in other compilations–&quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot;, &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; (&quot;Sega Mega Drive Collection&quot;), &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; (&quot;Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection&quot;)–and on the Virtual Console. A one-player only Sega CD version released as part of the &quot;Sega Classics Arcade Collection&quot;, with CD audio background music and voice-overs from the arcade version.

The arcade version is also on the Virtual Console and Xbox Live Arcade. A port of the game was released on PlayStation Network on 12 July 2011 and has been available free for PlayStation Plus users.

The game was released as part of the handheld TV game &quot;Arcade Legends Sega Genesis Volume 1&quot;. An enhanced remake with 3D graphics and orchestral music was released for PlayStation 2 as part of the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; line.

In August 2017, the Mega Drive/Genesis version was released for iOS and Android. It is now part of the Sega Forever service.

On 25 October 2021, The Mega Drive/Genesis version was released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

<doc id="1149065" wikidata="Q1002145" url="?curid=1149065" title="Fluidization">
<text>Fluidization (or fluidisation) is a process similar to liquefaction whereby a granular material is converted from a static solid-like state to a dynamic fluid-like state. This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material.

When a gas flow is introduced through the bottom of a bed of solid particles, it will move upwards through the bed via the empty spaces between the particles. At low gas velocities, aerodynamic drag on each particle is also low, and thus the bed remains in a fixed state. Increasing the velocity, the aerodynamic drag forces will begin to counteract the gravitational forces, causing the bed to expand in volume as the particles move away from each other. Further increasing the velocity, it will reach a critical value at which the upward drag forces will exactly equal the downward gravitational forces, causing the particles to become suspended within the fluid. At this critical value, the bed is said to be fluidized and will exhibit fluidic behavior. By further increasing gas velocity, the bulk density of the bed will continue to decrease, and its fluidization becomes more intense until the particles no longer form a bed and are &quot;conveyed&quot; upwards by the gas flow. 
When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas. Like water in a bucket: the bed will conform to the volume of the chamber, its surface remaining perpendicular to gravity; objects with a lower density than the bed density will float on its surface, bobbing up and down if pushed downwards, while objects with a higher density sink to the bottom of the bed. The fluidic behavior allows the particles to be transported like a fluid, channeled through pipes, not requiring mechanical transport (e.g. conveyor belt).

A simplified every-day-life example of a gas-solid fluidized bed would be a hot-air popcorn popper. The popcorn kernels, all being fairly uniform in size and shape, are suspended in the hot air rising from the bottom chamber. Because of the intense mixing of the particles, akin to that of a boiling liquid, this allows for a uniform temperature of the kernels throughout the chamber, minimizing the amount of burnt popcorn. After popping, the now larger popcorn particles encounter increased aerodynamic drag which pushes them out of the chamber and into a bowl.

The process is also key in the formation of a sand volcano and fluid escape structures in sediments and sedimentary rocks.

==Applications==

Most of the fluidization applications use one or more of three important characteristics of fluidized beds:
# Fluidized solids can be easily transferred between reactors.
# The intense mixing within a fluidized bed means that its temperature is uniform.
# There is excellent heat transfer between a fluidized bed and heat exchangers immersed in the bed.

In the 1920s, the Winkler process was developed to gasify coal in a fluidized bed, using oxygen. It was not commercially successful.
The first large scale commercial implementation, in the early 1940s, was the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process, which converted heavier petroleum cuts into gasoline. Carbon-rich &quot;coke&quot; deposits on the catalyst particles and deactivates the catalyst in less than 1 second. The fluidized catalyst particles are shuttled between the fluidized bed reactor and a fluidized bed burner where the coke deposits are burned off, generating heat for the endothermic cracking reaction.

By the 1950s, fluidized bed technology was being applied to mineral and metallurgical processes such as drying, calcining, and sulfide roasting.

In the 1960s, several fluidized bed processes dramatically reduced the cost of some important monomers. Examples are the Sohio process for acrylonitrile and the oxychlorination process for vinyl chloride. These chemical reactions are highly exothermic and fluidization ensures a uniform temperature, minimizing unwanted side reactions, and efficient heat transfer to cooling tubes, ensuring high productivity.

In the late 1970s, a fluidized bed process for the synthesis of polyethylene dramatically reduced the cost of this important polymer, making its use economical in many new applications. The polymerization reaction generates heat and the intense mixing associated with fluidization prevents hot spots where the polyethylene particles would melt. A similar process is used for the synthesis of polypropylene.

Currently, most of the processes that are being developed for the industrial production of carbon nanotubes use a fluidized bed. Arkema uses a fluidized bed to produce 400 tonnes/year of multiwall carbon nanotubes.

A new potential application of fluidization technology is chemical looping combustion, which has not yet been commercialized. One solution to reducing the potential effect of carbon dioxide generated by fuel combustion (e.g. in power stations) on global warming is carbon dioxide sequestration. Regular combustion with air produces a gas that is mostly nitrogen (as it is air&#x27;s main component at about 80% by volume), which prevents economical sequestration. Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier. These metal oxide particles replace air (specifically oxygen in the air) in a combustion reaction with a solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel in a fluidized bed, producing solid metal particles from the reduction of the metal oxides and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor, the major products of any combustion reaction. The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide which can be sequestered. The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air (and again, specifically oxygen in the air), producing heat and oxidizing the metal particles to metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor. A similar process is used to produce maleic anhydride through the partial oxidation of n-butane, with the circulating particles acting as both catalyst and oxygen carrier; pure oxygen is also introduced directly into the bed.

Nearly 50% of the silicon in solar cells is produced in fluidized beds. For example, metallurgical-grade silicon is first reacted to silane gas. The silane gas is thermally cracked in a fluidized bed of seed silicon particles, and the silicon deposits on the seed particles. The cracking reaction is endothermic, and heat is provided through the bed wall, typically made of graphite (to avoid metal contamination of the product silicon). The bed particle size can be controlled using attrition jets. Silane is often premixed with hydrogen to reduce the explosion risk of leaked silane in the air (see silane).

Liquid-solid fluidization has a number of applications in engineering The best-known application of liquid-solid fluidization is the backwash of granular filters using water.

Fluidization has many applications with the use of ion exchange particles for the purification and processing of many industrial liquid streams. Industries such as food &amp; beverage, hydrometallurgical, water softening, catalysis, bio-based chemical etc. use ion exchange as a critical step in processing. Conventionally ion exchange has been used in a packed bed where a pre-clarified liquid passes downward through a column. Much work has been done at the University of Western Ontario in London Ontario, Canada on the use of a continuous fluidized ion exchange system, named &quot;Liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed&quot; (LSCFB), recently being called &quot;Circulating fluidized ion exchange&quot; (CFIX). This system has widespread applications extending the use of traditional ion exchange systems because it can handle feed streams with large amounts of suspended solids due to the use of fluidization.

<text>LTI – Lingua Tertii Imperii: Notizbuch eines Philologen (1947) is a book by Victor Klemperer, Professor of Literature at the Dresden University of Technology. The title, half in Latin and half in German, translates to &quot;The Language of the Third Reich: A Philologist&#x27;s Notebook&quot;; the book is published in English translation as The Language of the Third Reich.

==Content==
&quot;Lingua Tertii Imperii&quot; studies the way that Nazi propaganda altered the German language to inculcate people with the ideas of Nazism. The book was written in the form of personal notes which Klemperer wrote in his diary, especially from the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933, and even more after 1935, when Klemperer was stripped of his academic title because he was of Jewish descent. His diary became a notebook in which he noted and commented on the linguistic relativity of the German used by Nazi officials, ordinary citizens, and even fellow Jews. Klemperer wrote the book, based on his notes, in 1945–1946.

&quot;LTI&quot; demonstrates changes in the German language in most of the population. In contrast, the text also emphasizes the idea that resistance to oppression begins by questioning the constant use of buzzwords. Both the book and its author unexpectedly survived the war. &quot;LTI&quot; was first published in 1947 in Germany.

It underlines odd constructions of words intended to give a &quot;scientific&quot; or neutral aspect to otherwise heavily engaged discourses, as well as significant every-day behaviour.

== Examples ==
Klemperer notes that much of the Nazi language involved appropriating old words and adapting their meaning, rather than making new ones. Among the examples he recorded of propagandistic language use were the following.

=== Recurrent words ===
* &quot;Artfremd&quot; (&quot;Alien to the species&quot;)
* &quot;Ewig&quot; (&quot;Eternal&quot;) E.gr.: &quot;der ewige Jude&quot; (the eternal Jew); &quot;das ewige Deutschland&quot; (the eternal Germany)
* &quot;fanatisch&quot;, &quot;Fanatismus&quot; (Fanatical / Fanaticism; used in a particularly Orwellian way: strongly positively connoted for the &quot;good&quot; side, and strongly negatively connoted for the &quot;bad&quot; side)
*&quot;Instinkt&quot; (instinct)
*&quot;spontan&quot; ()

=== Euphemisms (Schleierwörter) ===
* &quot;Evakuierung&quot; (&quot;evacuation&quot;): deportation
* &quot;Holen&quot; (&quot;pick up&quot;): arrest
* &quot;Konzentrationslager&quot; (&quot;concentration camp&quot;): extermination camp
* &quot;Krise&quot; (&quot;crisis&quot;): defeat
* &quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot; (&quot;special treatment&quot;): murder
* &quot;Verschärfte Vernehmung&quot; (&quot;strengthened interrogation&quot;): torture

=== Recurrent expressions and motives ===
* the war &quot;imposed&quot; onto a peace-loving &quot;Führer&quot;. (France and the United Kingdom did declare war on Germany, but only after Germany remilitarized the Rhineland, annexed Austria, annexed Czechoslovakia and invaded Poland.)
* the &quot;incommensurable hate&quot; of the Jews  – an example of Orwellian ambiguity: the Jews have an &quot;incommensurable hate&quot; of the Third Reich (aggressive or conspiratorial), but the German people have an &quot;incommensurable hate&quot; of the Jews (spontaneous and legitimate).
* Examples taken from Victor Klemperer&#x27;s diaries:
** January 1, 1935 – language tertii imperii: Lutze&#x27;s New Year message to the SA...Our &quot;fanatical will&quot; twice in a non-pejorative sense. Emphasis on believing without understanding. (1) &quot;fanatical engagement of the SA,&quot; (2) &quot;fanatical sense of commitment.&quot;
** November 24, 1936 – On the language of the Third Reich:...The Fuhrer must be followed blindly, blindly! They do not need to explain anything at all, since they are accountable to no one. Today it occurred to me: Never has the tension between human power and powerlessness, human knowledge and human stupidity been so overwhelmingly great as now.
** February 19, 1938 - ...the basic principle of the whole language of the Third Reich became apparent to me: a bad conscience; its triad: defending oneself, praising oneself, accusing - never a moment of calm testimony.
** May 23, 1938 – The aim of education in the Third Reich and of the language of the Third Reich, is to expand the popular stratum in everyone to such an extent that the thinking stratum is suffocated.
** August 29, 1939 – Lingua...there is no longer any talk of Bolshevists, but instead of the Russian people.
** December 31, 1940 – language tertii imperii: In Hitler&#x27;s New Year Order of the Day to the troops again the &quot;victories of unparalleled dimensions,&quot; again the American superlative, &quot;The year of 1941 will see the accomplishment of the greatest victory in our history.&quot;

=== Prefixes ===
* &quot;Groß-&quot; (&quot;Great&quot;)
* &quot;Volk(s)-&quot; (&quot;Volk = people, Volks = of or for the people (prefix)&quot;). &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; designated the racially pure community of nations. &quot;Volkswagen&quot; is an example of a term which has outlived the Third Reich.
* &quot;Welt-&quot; (&quot;world&quot;, as in &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;, &quot;intuition/view of the world&quot;): this was quite a rare, specific and cultured term before the Third Reich, but became an everyday word. It came to designate the instinctive understanding of complex geo-political problems by the Nazis, which allowed them to openly begin invasions, twist facts or violate human rights, in the name of a higher ideal and in accordance to their theory of the world.

=== Neologisms ===
* &quot;arisieren&quot; (&quot;to aryanise&quot;)
* &quot;aufnorden&quot; (&quot;to nordicise up&quot;, make more Nordic).
* &quot;entjuden&quot; (&quot;to de-Jew&quot;). Conversely, after the war, a strong trend of &quot;Entnazifizierung&quot; (&quot;denazification&quot;) took place.
* &quot;Untermenschentum&quot; (&quot;sub-humanity&quot;, from Untermensch)

== In film ==
*&quot;Language Does Not Lie&quot; (&quot;La langue ne ment pas&quot;), a 2003 documentary film based on Klemperer&#x27;s book, directed by Stan Neumann

<doc id="1149069" wikidata="Q16147165" url="?curid=1149069" title="American politics (political science)">
<text>American politics (or American government) is a field of study within the academic discipline of political science. It is primarily, but not exclusively, studied by researchers in the United States. Along with comparative politics, international relations, and political theory, it is one of the major fields of political science that are studied in American academic institutions.

Political scientists studying American politics are sometimes referred to within the discipline as &quot;Americanists&quot;. The field is conventionally divided into the sub-fields of political behavior and political institutions. It also consists of other major sub-fields, such as American political development (APD), which do not fit neatly into either category.

Research areas within the American political behavior sub-field include voting behavior, public opinion, partisanship, and the politics of race, gender, and ethnicity. Questions within the study of American political institutions include the legislative behavior and United States Congress, the presidency, courts and the legal process, bureaucracy, public law, state and local politics, and foreign policy. Scholars in American political development focus on determining how American politics has changed over time and what factors (institutional and behavioral) led to these changes. Public policy is also widely studied by Americanists.

In universities outside of the United States, American Politics generally refers to a course in comparative politics or a survey course in American domestics politics for International Relations within political science.

<text>Sheila Mary Florance (24 July 1916 – 12 October 1991) was an Australian actress known for her work in theatre, television and film.

Born in Melbourne, she married an Englishman in 1934 and relocated to London. Her early career was based on the London stage. Her first husband died in World War II in 1944.

In 1948, Florance returned to Australia and resumed her acting career, initially in the theatre before transitioning to film and television. She appeared in various Crawford Productions, gaining recognition for her role as Dossie Rumsay in &quot;Bellbird&quot;. She achieved international fame for her portrayal of Lizzie Birdsworth, an elderly alcoholic convict, in the television series &quot;Prisoner&quot;.

Florance died in 1991 from lung cancer, a week after receiving the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her final film, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Tale&quot;.
== Biography ==

===Early life===

Florance was born on 24 July 1916 at 42 Carrington Grove, East St Kilda, Melbourne. She was the eldest daughter of costumier Frances Josephine (née Lalor) and school teacher James Horn Florance. Sheila had at least one sibling: Peter John Lalor Florance (1923-2008).

Florance was educated at Presentation College, Windsor. She left school at the age of 15. With her father&#x27;s support, she developed an interest in acting and began taking small roles with the Melbourne Little Theatre at St Chad&#x27;s in South Yarra.

In February 1935, Florance achieved one of her early theatrical successes, appearing in John Hastings Turner&#x27;s play &quot;The Spot on the Sun&quot;. The production was staged by and featured Ada Reeve.

=== First marriage and move to England ===

On 19 April 1934, at the age of 17, Florance married Roger Lightfoot Oyston, a visiting Englishman, at Holy Angels Catholic Church in Balaclava following a whirlwind romance. The couple had their first child, a daughter named Susan, the following year. The family moved to England, initially staying with Roger’s parents in Deepdale Avenue, Scarborough, Yorkshire, before settling in a house on Sewerby Avenue, Bridlington. Their first son, Peter, was born on 20 May 1938.

As World War II approached, Florance joined the Women’s Land Army and worked on a farm near Bempton while her husband enlisted as an officer cadet. Florance often recounted a story of having a second daughter, Bridget, who she reported was killed in an air raid in 1941. However, no official record of Bridget’s birth or death exists, and Florence&#x27;s eldest son, Peter, was unable to verify the story.

In 1942, Susan and Peter were sent to boarding schools but later returned to live at Mill Farm. In June 1944, Roger Oyston, now a captain, went missing in action in France. Florance did not receive confirmation of his death until the following year. Their second son, Philip Michael, was born in September 1944.

After returning to Australia, Florance often recounted experiences of working with the British Drama League, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, and the Oxford Repertory Company during her time in Britain.

=== Second marriage and return to Australia ===

After World War II, Sheila Florance met Polish airman Jan Adam &quot;John&quot; Balawaider, who had served in the Royal Air Force with 158 Squadron during the war. The couple married on 3 September 1946 at Holy Cross Church in Hucknall, Nottingham.

Florance and Balawaider decided to emigrate to Australia. Upon marrying Balawaider, Florance acquired Polish nationality, which classified her as an alien and delayed her departure. While Balawaider, as a veteran, was able to travel ahead, Florance faced bureaucratic hurdles before she and her three children could join him. Eventually, they departed England aboard the Aberdeen &amp; Commonwealth Line vessel &quot;Esperance Bay&quot; on 6 March 1948.

Upon arrival in Fremantle, Peter Oyston recalled his mother &quot;ran down the gangplank ahead of everyone else and against the orders of the Captain or the crew, and knelt on the soil in the port, and then grabbed a handful of gravel and started eating it, and saying, &#x27;Oh, Australia, Australia, I&#x27;m home, I&#x27;m home. My lovely country.&quot;

Florance was soon reunited with her husband and the family moved into a run-down wooden cottage in Prahran, Victoria. By 1954, Florance’s home, often referred to as “The Hovel,” became a hub of social activity. According to Peter Oyston:&quot;[o]ver those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any people who came to see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they&#x27;d join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.&quot;

In March 1954, Florance&#x27;s 18-year-old daughter, Susan Oyston, fell from the roof of her workplace, the nine-storey National Bank building in Collins Street, Melbourne. At the time, Florance believed the fall was accidental. In a later interview with Sam Newman, Florence said she thought it was probably suicide and that she had failed her daughter. Years after Florance&#x27;s death, evidence was reported suggesting Susan might have been murdered.

After leaving &quot;Prisoner&quot; in 1983&quot;,&quot; Florance cared for Balawaider, who had suffered lifelong effects from wartime injuries. He died of cancer in October 1983.

===Death===
Florance died of cancer at the age of 75 on 12 October 1991. Nine days earlier, her son Philip had accepted the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role on her behalf at for her performance in her final film, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

Bud Tingwell wrote her obituary and said, &quot;nothing I write can express properly the admiration and love for Sheila Florance felt by so many of us who knew her ... This week at a service of celebration for Sheila Florance in St Kilda, Melbourne, where she was born and lived, the church was packed. She had a full house and a standing ovation.&quot;

Florance continued working in theatre in the 1960s, although she spent less time there. She earned a second Melbourne Critics Award nomination for her performance in &quot;The Chairs&quot; at the Little Theatre (1960) . By 1961, Florance had left Channel 2 to concentrate on repertory theatre, appearing in Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;The Guardsman&quot; (1961), &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (1961), and &quot;Dracula&quot; (1962). Also in 1962, Florance played Lady Macbeth in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Union Theatre. She also performed in Fritz Hochwälder&#x27;s &quot;The Public Prosecutor&quot; at the Little Theatre (1962), &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; at Russell Street Theatre (1962), and Michael Redgrave&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; (1962).

In 1963, Florance toured Victoria with the Union Theatre Repertory Company&#x27;s productions of &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; and Peter Batey&#x27;s &quot;The No-Hopers&quot;. In 1964, she appeared in Fay and Michael Kanin&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Rashomon&quot; at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre. In 1967, she joined the short-lived Melbourne Independent Theatre Company for their sole production, Brian Faull&#x27;s &quot;Life for the Living&quot;, at the Emerald Hill Theatre and performed in &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre. In 1968, she appeared with the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre company in Thomas Keneally&#x27;s &quot;Halloran&#x27;s Little Boat&quot; at the Playhouse Theatre, Perth. as part of the Festival of Perth, and then in Melbourne at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre.&quot;&quot; Florance&#x27;s last play of the 1960s was &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; in 1968 at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre.

Florance&#x27;s 1970s theatre work included Tyrone Guthrie&#x27;s production of &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (1970), &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre (1971), Sam Cree&#x27;s &quot;The Mating Season&quot; at Melbourne&#x27;s Comedy Theatre (1972), &quot;The Prisoner of Second Avenue&quot; at Russell Street Theatre (1973), &quot;The Time is Not Yet Ripe&quot; at the Comedy Theatre (1973), &quot;Design for Living&quot; at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre (1973–1974), Edward Bond&#x27;s &quot;The Sea&quot; at Russell Street Theatre (1974), and &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; at St Martin&#x27;s Theatre (1974).

In 1987, Florance performed in two final stage productions: &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Anthill Theatre and &quot;The Impostor&quot; at St Martin&#x27;s Youth Arts Centre.

===Film and television===
By 1959, Florance was working as a floor manager at television station Channel 2. That year, she appeared in a minor role in the television series &quot;Emergency&quot; (episode &quot;Mind Over Matter&quot;). In late 1962 and early 1963, she played defendants Laura Radford and Jocelyn Matthews in two episodes of &quot;Consider Your Verdict&quot;.

In 1965, Florance made her film debut as a deaf-mute person in &quot;Clay&quot;. During post-production, she dubbed the voice of Janina Lebedew, who portrayed the character Margot.
Florance also made her first of 18 appearances in &quot;Homicide&quot; and performed in &quot;Dangerous Corner&quot;, &quot;The Magic Boomerang&quot; (episode &quot;The Stand-In&quot;), and &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot; in 1965&quot;.&quot; In 1967, Florance began appearing intermittently as Dossie Rumsey in &quot;Bellbird&quot;, a role she continued into the 1970s. During this time, she also took on small roles in other productions such as &quot;Division 4&quot;.

In 1971, she portrayed Old Mrs Bacon in &quot;Country Town&quot;. That same year, she made her first of four appearances as Grace Falconer in &quot;Matlock Police&quot;.

In 1973, Florance appeared as Lorna Russell in the first episode of &quot;Ryan.&quot; In 1974, she appeared in the film Petersen. She continued to make single-episode appearances in television series such as &quot;Tandarra&quot; (1976), &quot;Bluey&quot; (1977), and &quot;Bobby Dazzler&quot; (1978), while increasingly focusing on film work.

In 1976, Florance played Mavis Lipton in &quot;End Play&quot; and had a small role in &quot;Illuminations&quot;. Her performance of Mrs Sullivan in &quot;The Devil’s Playground&quot; (1976) was followed by roles in &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (1977) and &quot;Summerfield&quot; (1977). In 1979, she portrayed May Swaisey—an elderly farm owner and friend of protagonist Max—in &quot;Mad Max&quot;. During filming, Florance broke her knee while handling an antique shotgun and completed her scenes with her leg and hip in plaster.

====&quot;Prisoner&quot;====

Starting in 1979, Florance became widely recognised for her role as Elizabeth Josephine &quot;Lizzie&quot; Birdsworth in &quot;Prisoner&quot;. Initially depicted as a recalcitrant, alcoholic inmate who was later revealed to be innocent, Lizzie was originally a minor character. However, by 1980, the character became a central figure.

Florance was the only original cast member hired without an audition; Reg Watson offered her the role after reviewing her photograph and credits. She remained with the series from its debut until episode 418 in 1984, appearing in 403 episodes. Florance won two Logie Awards for her work on &quot;Prisoner&quot;: Best Lead Actress in a Series in 1981 and Best Supporting Actress in a Series in 1983. She also joined other cast members in &quot;Prisoner in Concert&quot; (1981), a comedy musical spin-off filmed at Pentridge Prison in Coburg, Victoria.

In 1990, a British fan club invited Florance and other cast members of &quot;Prisoner&quot; to the United Kingdom. On 22 August 1990, Florance and Val Lehman were honoured with a civic reception by the Mayor of Derby.

During the tour, Florance underwent surgery to remove a large tumour. She returned to the tour days after her operation.

==== Post-&quot;Prisoner&quot; ====

Following a hiatus after her second husband’s death, Florance returned to acting with a role as Esme in the television series &quot;Winners&quot; (1985). She then appeared in Paul Cox’s films &quot;Handle With Care&quot; (1985) as Margaret’s mother and &quot;Cactus&quot; (1986) as Martha. Her later roles included playing grandmothers in Roger Scholes’ &quot;The Tale of Ruby Rose&quot; (1987) and &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; (1987). Florance also appeared in the short comedy &quot;Kick Start&quot; (1987).

Florance concluded the 1980s with performances in the television movie &quot;Becca&quot; (1988) as Old Becca and in a 1989 episode of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; (1989) as Madame Fortune.

In 1990, Florance played the character Molly in &quot;Nirvana Street Murder&quot;. Later that year, she appeared in &quot;Golden Braid&quot;, portraying the &quot;Lady with clock&quot;.

Florance&#x27;s final film, &quot;A Woman’s Tale&quot; (1991), was written specifically for her by Paul Cox and Barry Dickins as a tribute after they learned she was terminally ill with cancer. In the film, Florance portrayed Martha, an elderly, genteel woman living alone with her cherished possessions. Martha, who is dying of cancer, reflects on her life with her visiting nurse Anna (played by Gosia Dobrowolska). Cox recounted their collaboration in an interview with Richard Phillips:

I had a terrific friendship with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in my very first film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, &#x27;There is still time to turn me into a star, but let&#x27;s be quick.&#x27; I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman&#x27;s Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge to make a film about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, &quot;Please don&#x27;t die on me or you&#x27;ll kill me&quot;. She would reply, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;ll be a good girl.&quot;

The film and Florance&#x27;s performance garnered critical acclaim, winning Florance the AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

<text>In astrology, the Imum Coeli (IC; from Latin for &quot;bottom of the sky&quot;) is the point in space where the ecliptic crosses the meridian in the north, exactly opposite the Midheaven. It marks the fourth house cusp in most house systems (this is reversed in the southern hemisphere).

==Astrological significance==
The &quot;Imum Coeli&quot; is said to refer to people&#x27;s roots and also to the least conscious part of the self. It symbolizes foundations, beginnings in life, what may have been experienced through parental inheritance and homeland influences, need for security and relationships with the home and family life. It also may describe the circumstances that someone will encounter at the end of their life. Because this house was the most distant point possible from the visible part of the horoscope, Hellenistic astrologers considered the IC to be the home of the underworld, or Hades.

In many cases the IC refers to a parent—traditionally, the mother. Modern astrologers may use the IC as a significator for the father, or for both parents. There is no consensus in modern usage for which parent is best represented by the IC. The point is moot for Hellenistic astrologers who considered the fourth house the house of the father, but did not use the &quot;Imum Coeli&quot; as the cusp of the fourth house.

Using the natural houses system (see cadent houses) and modern quadrant house systems in which the IC is the cusp of the fourth house, some modern astrologers see a correspondence between the fourth house and the astrological sign Cancer. However, traditional astrologers, using whole-sign houses, never made this connection.

In whole-sign house systems the signs and houses have the same boundaries; hence the &quot;Imum Coeli&quot; can actually appear in the third house, the fourth house or fifth house; in cases of extreme terrestrial latitude, it may even fall in the second or sixth houses.

<text>Robbers Cave State Park is a state park in Latimer County, Oklahoma. It is located north of Wilburton, Oklahoma, on Oklahoma State Highway 2. Originally named Latimer State Park, it received its current name in 1936. It is located in the scenic, hilly woodlands of the Sans Bois Mountains of southeast Oklahoma. This park is a favorite of rappellers, equestrians, hikers and outdoor lovers. The park and adjoining wildlife management area covers more than and includes three lakes. It offers visitors acres of discovery and enjoyment including trout fishing in season, boating, hunting, mountain biking, trails for hikers and horses, sandstone cliffs for climbing and rappelling, and fall foliage viewing. In addition, Robbers Cave is historically notable as a former hideout for infamous outlaws Belle Starr and Jesse James.

==History==
The area surrounding the present-day park has been a hunting ground for hundreds of years. Archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest people were related to the builders of the Spiro Mounds. By the 1600s, the Osage and Caddo tribes dominated the area. French hunters and explorers also visited, leaving their mark by naming some of the prominent geographic features, which are still used.

In 1850 the area of Robbers Cave was assigned to the newly established Sans Bois County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.

After the Civil War, this area became legendary for sheltering fugitives from the law. Some of these included Jesse James and Belle Starr. Other fugitives included the Dalton Gang, the Youngers and the Rufus Buck Gang.

In 1929, Carlton Weaver, an editor and politician from Wilburton, donated 120 acres of land near Robbers Cave to the Boy Scouts of America for a campground. The warden of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary arranged for skilled prison inmates to construct camp improvements, including a kitchen and several other buildings, from rock quarried nearby. The new facility was named Camp Tom Hale, for a McAlester resident and Boy Scout supporter. The camp was adjacent to a tract of land that Weaver had leased to create a game preserve. Weaver later donated the preserve to the Oklahoma Fish and Game Commission.

The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was organized in 1933. Supervised by the National Park Service, the CCC built a bathhouse, cabins, trails, group camps, shelters, and roads. In 1937, CCC and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) created Lake Carlton, named for Carlton Weaver.

In 1987, the park initiated the first annual Robbers Cave Fall Festival, and the Robbers Cave Bluegrass Festival began in 1988. In 1994, Oklahoma converted the bathhouse to a nature center. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NR 96000489) in 2002.

==Park facilities==
The park encompasses three lakes: Lake Carlton, Lake Wayne Wallace and Coon Creek Lake. These were created by dams built on Fourche Maline Creek, a tributary of Poteau River. The combined surface area of the three lakes is .

RV sites, tent sites and equestrian campsites are available and lodging facilities at Robbers Cave State Park include the Belle Starr View Lodge, several cabins and two group camps. Leashed pets are allowed in the park and in some cabins. Picnic tables, comfort stations with showers, boat ramps, a swimming beach, swimming pool with bathhouse, playgrounds, miniature golf, hiking trails, horseback riding stables, paddle boat rentals, small grocery store, on-site restaurant, and a nature center with naturalist programs and exhibits round out the park&#x27;s facilities. Two tennis courts, a basketball court and a walking track are also available a few miles from the park. Several miles of trails are scattered throughout the park. Horses can be rented to follow the trails. One of the trails is northwest of the cave area and travels around Lost Lake.

The Boy Scout camp within the park was the site of Muzafer Sherif&#x27;s Robber&#x27;s Cave study on realistic conflict theory.

==Fees==
To help fund a backlog of deferred maintenance and park improvements, the state implemented an entrance fee for this park and 21 others effective June 15, 2020. The fees, charged per vehicle, start at $10 per day for a single-day or $8 for residents with an Oklahoma license plate or Oklahoma tribal plate. Fees are waived for honorably discharged veterans and Oklahoma residents age 62 and older and their spouses. Passes good for three days or a week are also available; annual passes good at all 22 state parks charging fees are offered at a cost of $75 for out-of-state visitors or $60 for Oklahoma residents. The 22 parks are:
* Arrowhead Area at Lake Eufaula State Park

<text>In 1919 the Australian government offered a prize of £A10,000 for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. Of the six entries that started the race, the winners were pilot Ross Smith, his brother Keith Smith as co-pilot, and mechanics James Bennett and Wally Shiers, in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber.

==The Competition==

In early 1919, the Commonwealth Government of Australia offered a prize of £A10,000 for the first flight from Great Britain to Australia, under specific conditions. In May 1919, Billy Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia, and Senator George Pearce, Minister for Defence (Australia), in consultation with the Royal Aero Club, stated that valid aircrews must all be Australian nationals, the aircraft must have been constructed in the British Empire, and the journey must be completed within 720 consecutive hours (30 days) and be completed before midnight on 31 December 1920. The departure point must be either Hounslow Heath Aerodrome (for landplanes) or RNAS Calshot (for seaplanes and flying boats), with reporting points at Alexandria and Singapore, and final destination in the region of Darwin. Each flight was to take place under the competition rules of the Royal Aero Club, that would supervise the start, and control the competition generally.

==Contestants==
===Sopwith Wallaby===
At 11.44 a.m. on 21 October 1919, Captain George Campbell Matthews AFC as pilot, and Sergeant Thomas D. Kay as mechanic, took off from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in a Sopwith Wallaby (G-EAKS). Bad weather caused delays at Cologne and Vienna, then they were imprisoned as suspected Bolsheviks in Yugoslavia, with further delays due to snow at Belgrade. A cracked engine cylinder at Constantinople, and bad weather at Aleppo caused more delays. Finally, on 17 April 1920, the Wallaby crashed on landing at Grokgak, on Bali. Matthews was slightly injured.

===Vickers Vimy===

Vickers entered a converted Vimy bomber (G-EAOU) (the registration being whimsically said to stand for &quot;God &#x27;elp all of us&quot;), crewed by Captain Ross Macpherson Smith with his brother Lieutenant Keith Macpherson Smith as co-pilot and mechanics Sergeant W.H. (Wally) Shiers and Sergeant J.M. (Jim) Bennett. The Vimy left Hounslow Heath at 8.30 am on 12 November 1919. It flew via Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon racecourse, Singora (Songkhla) (in Siam unscheduled in heavy rain), Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya where the aircraft was bogged and had to make use of a temporary airstrip made from bamboo mats, reaching Darwin at 4.10pm on 10 December 1919. The flight distance was estimated as 17,911 kilometres (11,123 mi) and total flying time was 135 hours 55 minutes (131.8 km/h or 81.9 mph). The prize money was shared between the Smith brothers and the two mechanics. The Smith brothers each received a knighthood for this exploit, and the company presented their aircraft to the Australian government. It is now displayed at Adelaide Airport.

===Alliance P.2===
On 13 November 1919, Lieutenant Roger M. Douglas, MC DCM and Lieutenant J.S.L. Ross took off from Hounslow Heath in an Alliance P.2 Seabird (G-EAOX) named &#x27;Endeavour&#x27;. It crashed in an orchard in Surbiton; Ross was killed outright, and Douglas died soon after of his injuries.

===Blackburn Kangaroo===
A team with a Blackburn Kangaroo (G-EAOW) had selected as navigator the Australian aviator Charles Kingsford Smith. Smith withdrew from the contest, and Captain Hubert Wilkins MC and bar took his place. On 21 November 1919, the Kangaroo took off from Hounslow Heath, piloted by Lieutenant V. Rendle with Captain Wilkins, Lieutenant D.R. Williams and Lieutenant Garnsey St. C. Potts as crew. Problems were experienced with the engines, and the plane was forced down over France. Repairs were made and the flight continued, still with engine problems. On 8 December 1919, the aircraft crash-landed at Suda Bay, Crete, ending up against the fence of a mental hospital. The crew escaped without injury.

===Martinsyde Type A===
On 5 December 1919, Captain Cedric E. Howell and Lieutenant George Henry Fraser left London in a Martinsyde Type A Mk.I (G-EAMR) aircraft. On 9 December, the aircraft disappeared near Corfu. The wreckage and Howell&#x27;s body were found offshore, but Fraser&#x27;s body was never found.
===Airco DH.9===
On 8 January 1920, Airco DH.9 (G-EAQM), piloted by Lieutenant Ray Parer, with co-pilot Lieutenant John C. McIntosh, took off from Hounslow Heath. The aircraft completed the flight, the first by a single-engined machine, in an epic 206 days later on 2 August 1920, earning Parer the sobriquet &quot;Battling Ray&quot;. Although outside the time limit, the crew was awarded a consolation prize of £A1,000, second only to the Vimy. The DH.9 has been restored and placed on display at the Australian War Memorial at Canberra. The story is detailed in the book Flight and Adventures of Parer and McIntosh written by Emily Charnwood and first published in 1921. The machine is labelled PD after its sponsor, millionaire Peter Dawson, a whisky manufacturer, who financed the purchase of the machine and much of the journey. Ray Parer later took part in a similar journey, the MacRobertson Trophy Air Race in 1934.

<text>The Silvermine Mountains or Silvermines Mountains () are a mountain range in County Tipperary, Ireland. The highest peak of the range is Keeper Hill or Slievekimalta at high. Traditionally, the mountains were deemed to be part of the Slieve Felim Mountains.
The village of Silvermines is located to the north of the mountains and has been a mining centre since the 14th century.

There are three Special Areas of Conservation on the Silvermine Mountains; the Silvermine Mountains SAC is known for its Northern Atlantic wet heaths, with &quot;Erica tetralix&quot; and species-rich &quot;Nardus&quot; grassland; the Silvermines Mountains West SAC is known for its Northern Atlantic wet heaths, with &quot;Erica tetralix&quot;, and its European dry heaths and Calaminarian grasslands where the levels of heavy metals, such as lead, are high, and are toxic to many plant species; and Keeper Hill SAC, known for its Northern Atlantic wet heaths with &quot;Erica tetralix&quot; and blanket bogs.

==History==
The oldest records of mine workings here date to 1289 when miners from Italy were working the seams. Silver was extracted for use in coinage, and lead for materials for the roof of new monasteries being built in the 13th century. Mining continued sporadically over the next 600 years. By the mid-nineteenth century, there were three engine houses with beam engines for crushing, winding and pumping. A new phase of activity occurred in the 1960s when a new rich deposit was found which was worked on the surface and underground. Operations ceased in 1984 but left behind them waste tips and tailings ponds.

==Slieve Felim Way==
The Slieve Felim Way, a long-distance trail through the Silvermine and Slieve Felim Mountains has a trail-head in the village of Silvermines. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Shannon Development and Coillte.

<text>Bhera (; ) is a city and a tehsil of Sargodha District, Punjab province of Pakistan. 
The city is known for wood-carved items, textiles (such as quilts and khussas), and certain desserts (such as pheonian and pateesa).

The city is made up of the walled Old Town and the surrounding newer development. The Old Town is surrounded by tall walls with eight gates, and is divided up into mohallas, or neighborhoods; historically, different castes lived in different mohallas. The Jhelum River flows to the north of Bhera.

The novel &quot;Mayyadas Ki Mari&quot; (Mayyadas&#x27;s Castle), written by Indian playwright Bhisham Singh Sahni, takes place in Bhera.

==History==
According to &quot;Ancient Geography of India&quot; by Alexander Cunningham, Bhera was once known as Jobnathnagar.

The &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of India&quot; records the history of Bhera:&lt;br&gt;


In the recent past centuries, Bhera was an important trading outpost on the road to Kabul, and boasted of a taksal (mint) during the rule of Ranjit Singh. The city was known for its knife and cutlery craftsmen, who made fighting daggers (&quot;Pesh-kabz&quot;) as well as hunting knives and table cutlery, often fitted with handles of serpentine (false jade) or horn. Sir Robert Baden-Powell described the process by which craftsmen manufactured gem-quality serpentine aka &quot;false jade&quot; from ores obtained from Afghanistan: &quot;The &quot;sang-i-yesham&quot; (ore) is cut by means of an iron saw, and water mixed with red sand and pounded (with) &quot;kurand&quot; (corundum). It is polished by application to the &quot;san&quot; (polishing wheel), wetted with water only, then by being kept wet with water, and rubbed with a piece of &quot;wati&quot; (smooth pottery fragment), and lastly by rubbing very finely pounded burnt &quot;sang-i-yesham&quot; on it. This last process must be done very thoroughly.&quot;

===Attacks on Bhera through history===
Bhera has also been attacked by a series of invaders, including:
* Alexander the Great
* Mahmud of Ghazni sacked the city in 1004 CE
* Genghis Khan
* Babar held it for ransom in 1519
* Mirza Muhammad Hakim sacked the city in 1566 C.E.
* Ahmad Shah Durrani attacked in 1757

<doc id="1149133" wikidata="Q979630" url="?curid=1149133" title="Industry Foundation Classes">
<text>The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is a CAD data exchange data schema intended for description of architectural, building and construction industry data.

It is a platform-neutral, open data schema specification that is not controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors. It is an object-based data schema with a data model developed by buildingSMART (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability, IAI) to facilitate interoperability in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, and is a commonly used collaboration format in Building information modeling (BIM) based projects. The IFC model specification is open and available. It is registered by ISO and is an official International Standard ISO 16739-1:2024.

Because of its focus on interoperability the Danish government in 2010 made the use of IFC format(s) compulsory for publicly aided building projects. In 2017 the Finnish state-owned facility management company Senate Properties started to demand use of IFC compatible software and BIM in all their projects. Also the Norwegian Government, Health and Defense client organisations require use of IFC BIM in all projects as well as many municipalities, private clients, contractors and designers have integrated IFC BIM in their business.. The popularity of the IFC data schema in construction has continued to grow, primarily for the purpose of exchanging geometry.

==History==

The IFC initiative began in 1994, when Autodesk formed an industry consortium to advise the company on the development of a set of C++ classes that could support integrated application development. Twelve US companies joined the consortium. These companies included AT&amp;T, HOK Architects, Honeywell, Carrier, Tishman and Butler Manufacturing. Initially named the Industry Alliance for Interoperability, the Alliance opened membership to all interested parties in September, 1995 and changed its name in 1997 to the International Alliance for Interoperability. The new Alliance was reconstituted as a non-profit industry-led organization, with the goal of publishing the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) as a neutral AEC product model responding to the AEC building lifecycle. A further name change occurred in 2005, and the IFC specification is now developed and maintained by buildingSMART.

==IFC Specifications==
The following IFC Specification versions are available

* IFC4.3 Add2 (2024)
* IFC4.2 (2019-04): withdrawn
* IFC4.1 (2018-86): withdrawn

* IFC 1.5.1 (September 1998)
* IFC 1.5 (November 1997)
* IFC 1.0 (June 1996)

==File Formats==
IFC defines multiple file formats that may be used, supporting various encodings of the same underlying data.
* IFC-SPF is a text format defined by ISO 10303-21 (&quot;STEP-File&quot;), where each line typically consists of a single object record, and having file extension &quot;.ifc&quot;. This is the most widely used IFC format, having the advantage of compact size yet readable text.
* IFC-XML is an XML format defined by ISO 10303-28 (&quot;STEP-XML&quot;), having file extension &quot;.ifcXML&quot;. This format is suitable for interoperability with XML tools and exchanging partial building models. Due to the large size of typical building models, this format is less common in practice.
* IFC-ZIP is a ZIP compressed format consisting of an embedded IFC-SPF file or IFC-XML file and having file extension &quot;.ifcZIP&quot;.
* IFC-Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) is a textual semantic data format that uses RDF and is expressed in the ifcOWL ontology.
* IFC-RDF is a XML-based semantic data format that uses RDF and is expressed in the ifcOWL ontology.
* ifcJSON uses JSON, a modern format often used by web applications.
* ifcHDF uses HDF and is based on the ISO 10303-26 standard for STEP data representation in HDF.

IFC-SPF is in ASCII format which, while human-readable, suffers from common ASCII file issues, in that file-sizes are bloated, files must be read sequentially from start to finish, mid-file extraction is not possible, files are slow to parse, and definitions are non-hierarchical. In addition to ifcXML and ifcZIP, modern data formats include RDF/XML or Turtle (using the ifcOWL ontology), ifcJSON (JavaScript Object Notation, broadly available) and ifcHDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format v5, binary). In 2020, buildingSmart had two JSON projects underway: ifcJSON v4 (a direct mapping from EXPRESS-based IFC v4) and ifcJSON v5, plus a research project experimenting with turning IFC into a binary format.

==Architecture==
IFC defines an EXPRESS based entity-relationship model consisting of several hundred entities organized into an object-based inheritance hierarchy. Examples of entities include building elements such as IfcWall, geometry such as IfcExtrudedAreaSolid, and basic constructs such as IfcCartesianPoint.

At the most abstract level, IFC divides all entities into rooted and non-rooted entities. Rooted entities derive from IfcRoot and have a concept of identity (having a GUID), along with attributes for name, description, and revision control. Non-rooted entities do not have identity and instances only exist if referenced from a rooted instance directly or indirectly. IfcRoot is subdivided into three abstract concepts: object definitions, relationships, and property sets:
*IfcObjectDefinition captures tangible object occurrences and types
*IfcRelationship captures relationships among objects
*IfcPropertyDefinition captures dynamically extensible properties about objects.

===IfcObjectDefinition===
IfcObjectDefinition is split into object occurrences and object types. IfcObject captures object occurrences such as a product installation having serial number and physical placement. IfcTypeObject captures type definitions (or templates) such as a product type having a particular model number and common shape. Occurrences and types are further subdivided into six fundamental concepts: actors (&quot;who&quot;), controls (&quot;why&quot;), groups (&quot;what&quot;), products (&quot;where&quot;), processes (&quot;when&quot;), and resources (&quot;how&quot;). 
* IfcActor represents people or organizations. 
* IfcControl represents rules controlling time, cost, or scope such as work orders.
* IfcGroup represents collections of objects for particular purpose such as electrical circuits. 
* IfcProduct represents occurrences in space such as physical building elements and spatial locations. 
* IfcProcess represents occurrences in time such as tasks, events, and procedures. 
* IfcResource represents usage of something with limited availability such as materials, labor, and equipment.

===IfcRelationship===
IfcRelationship captures relationships among objects. There are five fundamental relationship types: composition, assignment, connectivity, association, and definition.
* IfcRelDecomposes captures a whole-part relationship having exclusive containment such as subdividing a building into floors and rooms or a wall into studs and sheathing. 
* IfcRelAssigns captures assignment relationships where one object consumes the services of another object, such as a labor resource assigned to a task, or a task assigned to a building element. 
* IfcRelConnects indicates connectivity between objects such as a floor slab connected to a beam or a pipe connected to a sink. 
* IfcRelAssociates indicates external references for an object such as an external IFC library file where an object is defined. 
* IfcRelDefines indicates an instance-of relationship such as a pipe segment being of a particular type.

===IfcPropertyDefinition===
IfcPropertyDefinition captures dynamically extensible property sets. A property set contains one or more properties which may be a single value (e.g. string, number, unit measurement), a bounded value (having minimum and maximum), an enumeration, a list of values, a table of values, or a data structure. While IFC defines several hundred property sets for specific types, custom property sets may be defined by application vendors or end users.
* IfcPropertySet represents a set of properties attached to an object occurrence or object type. 
* IfcPropertySetTemplate [IFC2x4] captures definitions of properties and their data types.

===Products===
IfcProduct is the base class for all physical objects and is subdivided into spatial elements, physical elements, structural analysis items, and other concepts. Products may have associated materials, shape representations, and placement in space. Spatial elements include IfcSite, IfcBuilding, IfcBuildingStorey, and IfcSpace. Physical building elements include IfcWall, IfcBeam, IfcDoor, IfcWindow, IfcStair, etc. Distribution elements (HVAC, electrical, plumbing) have a concept of ports where elements may have specific connections for various services, and connected together using cables, pipes, or ducts to form a system. Various connectivity relationships are used for building elements such as walls having openings filled by doors or windows.

Materials may be defined for products as a whole, or as layers, profiles, or constituents for specified parts.
* IfcMaterial indicates a specific material, with optional properties (e.g. mechanical, thermal) and styles (e.g. colors, textures).
* IfcMaterialLayerSet captures a list of layers, each indicating a material of a specified thickness.
* IfcMaterialProfileSet [IFC2x4] captures a set of profiles, each indicating a material of a specified cross-section.
* IfcMaterialConstituentSet [IFC2x4] captures a set of constituents, each indicating a material used at a named shape aspect.

Representations may be defined for explicit 3D shape, and optionally as parametric constraints. Each representation is identified by IfcShapeRepresentation with a well-known name. 
* &#x27;Body&#x27; indicates a 3D shape which may be represented by B-rep, NURBS, Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), or swept profiles. It may be defined directly or derived by applying material definitions to other representations.
* &#x27;Axis&#x27; indicates a path for linear elements (e.g. wall, beam, pipe) for which material profiles or layers are aligned.
* &#x27;FootPrint&#x27; indicates a boundary for planar elements (e.g. slab, staircase) for which material layers are bounded.
* &#x27;Profile&#x27; indicates a side profile for opening elements (e.g. door, window) for which material constituents are bounded.
* &#x27;SurveyPoints&#x27; indicates a set of points for surface elements (e.g. site) for describing contours.

Placement may indicate position, vertical angle, and horizontal angle.
* IfcLocalPlacement indicates placement relative to an enclosing element hierarchy.
* IfcGridPlacement indicates placement relative to a grid with user-defined axes.

Quantities may be defined for take-off purposes such as Gross Area, Gross Volume, Gross Weight, Net Weight, etc. IFC defines various quantities specific to each element type and the method of calculation according to geometry and relationships.

===Processes===
IfcProcess is the base class for processes and is subdivided into tasks, events, and procedures. Processes may have durations and be scheduled to occur at specific time periods. Processes may be sequenced such that a successor task may start after a predecessor task finishes, following the Critical Path Method. Processes may be nested into sub-processes for summary roll-up. Processes may be assigned to products indicating the output produced by the work performed.

===Resources===
IfcResource is the base class for resources and is subdivided into materials, labor, equipment, subcontracts, crews, and more. Resources may have various costs and calendars of availability. Resources may be nested into sub-resources for granular allocation. Resources may be assigned to processes indicating tasks performed on behalf of a resource.

===Contexts===
IfcProject encapsulates an overall project and indicates the project name, description, default units, currency, coordinate system, and other contextual information. A valid IFC file must always include exactly one IfcProject instance, from which all other objects relate directly or indirectly. A project may include multiple buildings, multiple participants, and/or multiple phases according to the particular use.

In addition to project-specific information, an IfcProject may also reference external projects from which shared definitions may be imported such as product types. Each external project is encapsulated using IfcProjectLibrary [IFC2x4] along with IfcRelAssociatesLibrary and IfcLibraryInformation to identify the particular revision of the imported project library.

Projects support revision control where any IfcRoot-based entity has a unique identifier and may be marked as added, modified, deleted, or having no change. Such capability allows multiple IFC files to be merged deterministically, ensuring data integrity without human intervention.

<doc id="1149136" wikidata="Q2618800" url="?curid=1149136" title="Iraqi Islamic Party">
<text>The Iraqi Islamic Party is the largest Sunni Islamist political party in Iraq as well as the most prominent member of the Iraqi Accord Front political coalition. It was part of the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and is part of the current government of Haider al-Abadi since 2014. Osama Tawfiq al-Tikriti succeeded Vice-President Tariq al-Hashimi as the party&#x27;s secretary-general on 24 May 2009, who was succeeded in July 2011 by Ayad al-Samarrai.

The IIP evolved out of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, and was banned from 1961 during Iraqi nationalist rule, something which continued throughout the reign of the Pan-Arab Ba&#x27;ath Party right up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Like the Muslim Brotherhood, the IIP&#x27;s religious rather than ethno-political ideology made the party systematically incompatible under the Iraqi governments between 1961 and 2003.

During the 1970s, the IIP began operating in exile in Great Britain and published a newspaper called &quot;Dar al-Salam&quot;. Iyad al-Samara&#x27;i was elected to serve as secretary-general.

==Party leaders==
*Shura Council Chairman: Dr. Mohsen Abdel Hamid
*Secretary-General: Rashid al-Azzawi
*Deputy Secretary-General:
*Assistant Secretary-General: Dr. Ziad al-Ani

===Political Bureau===
*Dr. Alaa Maki
*Dr. Omar Abdul Sattar Karbouli
*Professor Abd al-Karim al-Samarrai
*Professor Naseer al-Ani

==Post-invasion==
Mohsen Abdel Hamid served on the Iraqi Governing Council that worked alongside the Coalition Provisional Authority after the invasion of Iraq. It joined the Iraqi Interim Government where it had one minister, Hajim al-Hassani.

On 9 November 2004, the IIP withdrew from the government in protest over Operation Phantom Fury, an offensive at Fallujah led by U.S. forces. Hassani chose to stay in the government and quit the party, later joining The Iraqis list.

==Government participation==
The party initially supported the general elections of 30 January 2005 but pulled out of the national election one month before the vote saying violence made a fair election impossible. The party did participate in some elections for governorate level posts on the same day (see for instance 2005 Ninawa governorate election and 2005 Al-Anbar governorate council election).

The IIP led a large-scale public campaign urging Iraqis (especially the Sunnis) to vote against the constitutional referendum in 2005. Two days before the referendum took place, the IIP announced its support for a &quot;yes&quot; vote, following a compromise with the members of the Iraqi Transitional Government whereby the newly elected Iraqi National Assembly would consider amendments to the constitution in 2006.

In the December 2005 election, the IIP ran as part of the Iraqi Accord Front coalition, which won 44 seats, the most for any Sunni Arab coalition. The leader of Al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Mu&#x27;sab al-Zarqawi, condemned the IIP for their participation in the general election.

The party&#x27;s platform for the elections included demanding a timetable for the withdrawal of the Multinational force in Iraq, opposition to federalism in Iraq, opposition to De-Ba&#x27;athification and promotion of Islamic values.

Following the elections in 2006, the IAF joined the United Iraqi Alliance-led government of Nouri al-Maliki. In 2012, the party formed a coalition several Sunni Islamists parties called Muttahidoon.

==Relationship with US==
The party has often criticized the US military presence in Iraq. In October 2008, following a US-backed raid that resulted in the death of a man the IIP said was a senior party official, the party said in a statement that it was suspending all contact with US civilian and military officials. A US military drone crashed into the party&#x27;s offices in Mosul in 2009. A spokesman for US forces in Iraq said the location of the crash was a pure coincidence.

<text>Lennox Valencia Miller (8 October 1946 in Kingston, Jamaica – 8 November 2004 in Pasadena, California) was a champion runner and father of Inger Miller.

Representing Jamaica, Miller won the silver medal in the 100 meters in the 1968 Summer Olympics and the bronze in the 1972 Summer Olympics, also in the 100.

He and Inger are the first father-daughter to win Olympic track and field medals. He was her coach prior to her winning gold in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Both ran for the University of Southern California, where Miller earned a degree in psychology and graduated from the dental school. He had been a dentist in Pasadena for 30 years.

While at USC, Miller anchored the still standing World Record 4x110 yard relay at the NCAA Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championships, held at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. The Imperial distance became defunct as the IAAF now only recognizes metric races (except the one Mile run), so the event is rarely run and not part of elite competition. The record was also complicated because of Miller&#x27;s Jamaican citizenship, the makeup of the team was not entirely from one country. Miller took the baton from O. J. Simpson. Also on the team was future NFL star Earl McCullouch.

<doc id="1149138" wikidata="Q1050985" url="?curid=1149138" title="Old Bexley and Sidcup (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Old Bexley and Sidcup is a constituency in Greater London represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since its 1983 creation. Its first Member of Parliament (MP) was former Prime Minister Edward Heath, who previously represented Bexley (1950–1974) and Sidcup (1974–1983). The seat has been held since a 2021 by-election by Louie French of the Conservative Party, following the death of incumbent James Brokenshire.
==History and profile==
The seat was created in 1983 by combining a small part of the abolished seat of Bexleyheath, chiefly Old Bexley, with the abolished seat of Sidcup.

On 29 January 2008 the Conservative Party withdrew the whip from the constituency&#x27;s MP, Derek Conway, following alleged misuse of funds revealed by the MPs expenses controversy, who declined to resign as MP and became an Independent. He retired from national politics in 2010.

Sir Edward Heath (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1970–1974) held this area (also referring to its main predecessor seats, Bexley and Sidcup) from 1950 until 2001 when he retired at the age of 84, at the time the longest-serving MP in the Commons, known as the Father of the House.

;Political overview
The seat has been won at general elections since creation by the Conservative Party candidate. The 1997 New Labour landslide saw the party&#x27;s majority fall to its lowest level of 7% of the vote. Its greatest level has to date been 41.5% of the vote — in 1987.

In 2010 the seat was won by the Conservative candidate James Brokenshire, who had transferred to this seat and approved by his local party when his former seat of Hornchurch was abolished in boundary changes. His 2015 result made the seat the 105th safest of the Conservative Party&#x27;s 331 seats by percentage of majority. The seat was left vacant following Brokenshire&#x27;s death on 7 October 2021. until a by-election was held on 2 December which resulted in a Conservative hold.

==Boundaries==

=== Historic ===
1983–1997: The London Borough of Bexley wards of Blackfen, Blendon and Penhill, Cray, Lamorbey, St Mary&#x27;s, Sidcup East, and Sidcup West.

1997–2010: The London Borough of Bexley wards of Blackfen, Blendon and Penhill, Cray, Danson, East Wickham, Falconwood, Lamorbey, St Mary&#x27;s, Sidcup East, and Sidcup West.
2010–2024: The London Borough of Bexley wards of Blackfen and Lamorbey, Blendon and Penhill, East Wickham, Falconwood and Welling, Longlands, St Mary&#x27;s, and Sidcup.

As its name suggests, the seat covers the Bexley and Sidcup areas; it formerly included Danson Park which owing to more development in the south was moved to the Bexleyheath and Crayford constituency.

=== Current ===

Further to the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies, which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the constituency is composed of:

* The London Borough of Bexley wards of: Blackfen &amp; Lamorbey; Blendon &amp; Penhill; East Wickham; Falconwood &amp; Welling; Longlands; St. Mary’s &amp; St. James; Sidcup.

&quot;The revised contents take into account the local government boundary review for Bexley which became effective in May 2018. Boundaries were extended slightly by adding the parts of the expanded East Wickham and Falconwood &amp; Welling wards previously in Bexleyheath and Crayford.&quot;

==Constituency profile==
Old Bexley and Sidcup has average incomes among the highest of all constituencies, a high proportion of semi-detached and detached homes and low unemployment with a lower than average dependency on social housing.

The constituency generally consists of middle-class and lower middle-class outer London suburbia, served by the Dartford Loop and Bexleyheath commuter railway lines to Central London. Sidcup has been largely developed to neat garden suburb-inspired building schemes for most homes.

<doc id="1149164" wikidata="Q901155" url="?curid=1149164" title="Placebo (Placebo album)">
<text>Placebo is the debut studio album by British alternative rock band Placebo. It was released on 17 June 1996 by record label Virgin. It is the only album recorded with drummer Robert Schultzberg before his departure from the group.

The album was a commercial success in the UK, reaching number 5 in the UK Albums Chart. It spawned five singles, including &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; and &quot;36 Degrees&quot;. The album was remastered and reissued in 2006 for its tenth anniversary, including demos and a DVD featuring live performances and music videos from the album.

== Background and recording ==

Placebo were formed in 1994 with the partnering of Brian Molko (vocals, guitar) and Stefan Olsdal (guitar, bass). At the time, Olsdal was taking guitar lessons and was on his way home when he met Molko at the South Kensington tube station. Molko, observing that Olsdal had a guitar strapped to his back, invited Olsdal to watch him perform at a local bar. On the strength of Molko&#x27;s performance, Olsdal decided that the two of them should start a band.

The two initially formed Ashtray Heart, a lo-fi duo, playing mostly on children&#x27;s toy instruments. The duo needed a drummer, and although Steve Hewitt - who would play later with Placebo - was their first choice, he was working with London-based band Breed at the time. This led Robert Schultzberg to assume the position of drummer. Schultzberg had known Olsdal from boarding school in Sigtuna, Sweden where they&#x27;d played together in a band.

The newly formed band released the single &quot;Come Home&quot; on Deceptive Records in February 1996. This led to signing a contract with Hut Records and the band began to work on their debut album. &quot;Placebo&quot; was recorded over two months in 1996 in Dublin and London and was produced by Brad Wood.

After an argument in August 1996 shortly before their first TV appearance, Molko decided that it would be best for the band if Schultzberg left. However, Schultzberg suggested playing together until they finished the promotion for the album, which the rest of band accepted. Before going on stage for their first show in the state of New York, Olsdal informed Schultzberg that he wouldn&#x27;t perform on the tour in Germany that was following the US tour. Schultzberg played two more shows with the band in Paris after the US tour, the last of which was a performance at &quot;Nulle Part Aillleurs&quot;. Molko has said that he was &quot;tired of being the focus of Robert&#x27;s rages against the world&quot;. Schultzberg left the band in September 1996 and was replaced by Hewitt.

== Composition ==

=== Lyrics and themes ===

Many of the songs on &quot;Placebo&quot; were written in 1995. Regarding the album&#x27;s opening track &quot;Come Home&quot;, Molko called it &quot;punk pop for postponed suicides&quot;. &quot;Teenage Angst&quot; is about the emotions you feel as a teenager and want to have everything kept to yourself and create your own world, while Molko says &quot;Bionic&quot; is &quot;about a robot fuck&quot;.

The meaning of the album&#x27;s fourth song &quot;36 Degrees&quot;, either sexual preference or death, has caused debate among fans. Molko has stated the title is a play on words regarding the expression &quot;cold blooded&quot;, as the average human body temperature is 37 °C (99 °F). Molko has stated the song&#x27;s inspiration came from his fascination with skin texture and the warmth of other human bodies; moreover, he originally intended to call the album &quot;Body Politic&quot;.

&quot;Hang on to Your IQ&quot; is about self-deprecation regarding intelligence. Molko has stated it is the most &quot;story-like&quot; song on the album: &quot;The person [in the song] is having a breakdown about every physical and emotional thing they could feel.&quot;

&quot;Nancy Boy&quot; differs from previous songs&#x27; themes about drugs, sex, gender confusion and bisexuality.

The track &quot;Lady of the Flowers&quot; is influenced by Jean Genet&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Our Lady of the Flowers&quot; which Genet wrote for his own entertainment whilst in prison.

Molko states the song &quot;Swallow&quot; was inspired by an acid trip Molko and Olsdal had, saying it was never written in a state of reality. Initial pressings of the CD included &quot;H.K. Farewell&quot; as a hidden track which began playing approximately 10 minutes after the end of &quot;Swallow&quot;. Certain versions of the album replaced the album version of &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; with the single version, known as &quot;Nancy Boy (Sex Mix)&quot;. The band debated whether or not to put &quot;Slackerbitch&quot; on the record, but eventually decided against it; &quot;Slackerbitch&quot; was included on the 2006 reissue.

Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in June 2009, Brian Molko remembered:We wrote most of the album in a council flat in Deptford. The way we sounded and looked was a reaction against the place. But also a lot of our cross-dressing and transvestism was a political statement against the music scene at the time which was very laddish and macho. We wanted to stand up and be counted. There&#x27;s no better way to do that than by putting a bunch of slap on, wearing a skirt and f***ing with people&#x27;s heads. People hated us for it and I adored that. Not getting a reaction was an anathema to me at the time. When I look back at the album, I see naivety, missed opportunities and mistakes. But you can get your knickers in a twist about it or you can just accept they&#x27;re part of you. I view &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; in a way I imagine Radiohead look at &quot;Creep&quot;. I just wish the song that propelled us into the limelight had been a little bit better written. It&#x27;s the lyrics that make me cringe most. They&#x27;re me trying to find my feet.

== Packaging ==

On 23 June 2012, it emerged that the boy photographed for the album cover, David Fox (shown wearing a red jumper and pulling his face downward), was threatening to sue the band for &quot;ruining&quot; his life. His cousin Saul Fletcher had taken the photo. Fox claims he was quite popular at the time and that when the album came out everyone bullied him.

The inserts for the album feature another picture of the boy on the cover and a very small picture of the band. The rest of it is green or blue paper, with no lyrics. The reason for this is that Molko did not want people to focus on the liner, but rather the music itself.

== Release ==
&quot;Placebo&quot; was released on 17 June 1996 in the UK on Elevator Music/Hut Records and 9 July in the US on Caroline Records on CD, cassette and vinyl. The album reached number 5 in the UK Albums Chart, staying there for 13 weeks, and at number 50 in France. The album went gold in the UK on 1 May 1997, and platinum on 22 July 2013. It was certified double gold in France in 2003.

Prior to the release of &quot;Placebo&quot;, several singles were released to promote the album: &quot;Bruise Pristine&quot;, &quot;Come Home&quot; and &quot;36 Degrees&quot;. Placebo released two more singles after the release of the album: &quot;Teenage Angst&quot; and &quot;Nancy Boy&quot;. &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; was a hit and reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. Placebo filmed music videos for all singles from this album.

== Reception ==
&quot;NME&quot; called the album &quot;dangerous, mysterious and utterly addictive&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that it &quot;establishes the trio as a strong contender in the Britpop scene.&quot;

In his retrospective review, Nitsuh Abebe of AllMusic wrote &quot;[the band] brings together various influences – the epic, noisy &#x27;Chicago sound&quot;, late-&#x27;70s prog rock and late-&#x27;80s &#x27;college rock&#x27; – but boils them down into fairly conventional, guitar-heavy melodrama, with the sort of opaque and angst-ridden lyrics usually found in that genre. That&#x27;s not to say that Placebo&#x27;s sound is boring; churning guitars and direct, heavy basslines give the album a good deal of strength, and Molko is able to write moving, gritty melodies and fairly clever lyrics.&quot;

== Legacy ==

In 1998 &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted it at number 87 in its &quot;All Time Top 100 Albums&quot; list. Virgin placed the album 154th in its &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; list. In 1999, Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 94 on his list of &quot;The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties&quot;.

<doc id="1149165" wikidata="Q537572" url="?curid=1149165" title="French Crown Jewels">
<text>The French Crown Jewels () and [[Regalia]] comprise the crowns, orb, sceptres, diadems and jewels that were symbols of Royal or Imperial power between 752 and 1870. These were worn by many Kings and Queens of France as well as Emperor Napoleon. The set was finally broken up, with most of it sold off in 1885 by the Third Republic. The surviving French Crown Jewels, principally a set of historic crowns, diadems and parures, are mainly on display in the &quot;Galerie d&#x27;Apollon&quot; of the Louvre, France&#x27;s premier museum and former royal palace, together with the Regent Diamond, the Sancy Diamond and the &quot;Côte-de-Bretagne&quot; red spinel, carved into the form of a dragon. In addition, some gemstones and jewels (including the Emerald of Saint Louis, the Ruspoli sapphire and the diamond pins of Queen Marie Antoinette) are on display in the Treasury vault of the Mineralogy gallery in the National Museum of Natural History.

==Use of the French crown jewels==

The Crown jewels comprise the instruments of the coronation, called the Regalia, and the jewels of the ruling family.

Since Pepin the Short in 752, the accession of the King of France was legitimated by a coronation ceremony called a &quot;sacre&quot;, since the emphasis was on the unction with the chrism of the Holy Ampulla, performed for the first time at Notre-Dame de Reims in 816 for Louis the Pious, then with the Crown of Charlemagne. From 888 to 922, then 1027, all monarchs were crowned until the French Revolution, in the Notre-Dame de Reims cathedral (apart from Louis VI and Henry IV, who were crowned in Orléans and Chartres). After the revolution, only Emperor Napoleon, Empress Joséphine and King Charles X were crowned. Though not always used, a set of expensive crown jewels did exist and was augmented by various monarchs.

The Crown Jewels or &quot;Diamants de la Couronne de France&quot;, consisting of gemstones and jewellery, became unalienable by decision of Francis I on June 15, 1530. The &quot;Côte-de-Bretagne&quot; red spinel was then among the 8 main jewels. They suffered important loss by the Catholic League in 1590 but were reconstituted by Henry IV and greatly enhanced by Louis XIV, notably with the gift of the 18 Mazarin diamonds and the purchase of the &#x27;Royal French Blue&#x27; and &#x27;Ruspoli&#x27; sapphire, later followed in 1717 with the Regent Diamond. Under Louis XV, they were kept in the &quot;Garde Meuble de la Couronne&quot; (Royal Treasury) in one of the pavilions of the Place de la Concorde, where they suffered a theft in 1792 and a sale in 1795 after their partial recovery. In 1814, Napoleon had restored the crown jewels to 65,072 stones and pearls, not including the personal jewels of both Empress Joséphine and Empress Marie Louise. Enhanced during the Restoration and again during the Second Empire, they counted 77,662 stones and pearls, comprising 51,403 brilliant cut diamonds, 21,119 rose cut diamonds, 2962 pearls, 507 rubies, 136 sapphires, 250 emeralds, 528 turquoises, 22 opals, 235 amethysts and 500 other stones, when they were sold in 1885 by the Third Republic. Nevertheless, as in 1793, an important set of stones and pearls was sent to the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle and some of the most important jewels were bought back since 1953, which makes the collection still number more than 11,000 stones and pearls.

The Regalia, much lightly hit in 1590, were originally kept in the treasure of the Basilica of Saint Denis from where they were removed in 1793 during the French Revolution. Some few pieces of the treasure, considered to present an artistic value, were preserved and sent to the Louvre, which sold 9 of them in 1798, the National Library, the Natural History Museum, and the archbishops of Rouen (5 items) and Paris. The others, were sold in 1793 like the chalice and two cruets of Saint Denis, or dismantled and melted down in April 1794, like the Crown of Charlemagne and the ones of Saint Louis and the Queens, with the rest of the basilica treasure including the cross of Saint Eligius, the screen of Charlemagne, the gilded altar of Charles the Bald or the large reliquaries. The liturgical instruments kept in Reims suffered the same policy. The Regalia were restored or recreated for the coronation of Napoleon, which at their turn suffered again partial destruction in 1819, and finally completed for the coronation of Charles X in 1825.

Of about 20 documented royal crowns of the Ancien Régime, the only surviving one from the destructions of 1590 and 1793 is the crown of Louis XV. The king had the Regent Diamond set in the lower part of the fleur-de-lis in the front of his crown, while eight of the famous Mazarin diamonds that the cardinal had bequeathed to the French Crown are set in the other seven fleur-de-lis and in the circlet of the crown. Diamonds and colored gemstones are set between two rows of pearls on the circlet and are also set into the four arches that rise behind the fleur-de-lis and the eight ornamental points between the fleur-de-lis. At the junction of these four arches is a small pedestal surrounded by two rows of small diamonds on either side of a row of small pearls. Eight larger diamonds set between this pedestal and the arches give the effect of a sunburst when the crown is viewed from above. On the pedestal rises a double fleur-de-lis formed of nine large diamonds, including the Sancy Diamond which forms the central upper petal of this double fleur-de-lis. The gold brocade cap which lines the crown is also ornamented with large diamonds.

Since the Middle Ages, and previous to the making of this crown, the crowns of French kings were adorned with gemstones like on the crown of Charlemagne or the crown of Saint Louis, sometimes called the &quot;Sainte Couronne&quot;. But some of the most valuable precious stones could be removed from them, since it was traditional for a French king to bequeath his crown to the treasury of the Abbey, now Basilica of St Denis, on their deaths. This crown was also bequeathed to Saint Denis on the death of Louis XV, but not before the diamonds had been replaced with crystals, and it is on display presently in the Louvre, similarly set with crystals.

===Crown of Napoleon I===
The crown of Napoleon was made by the jeweller Martin-Guillaume Biennais with antique cameos for the coronation of the Emperor in 1804. His gilded crown of laurels was destroyed in 1819 by Louis XVIII with the one of Empress Josephine, the orb and the eagle sceptre. His coronation throne is at the Louvre and the coronation ring of Empress Josephine at the Château de Malmaison.

===Crown of Empress Eugénie===

The crown of Empress Eugénie was created in 1855 by Gabriel Lemonnier for the World&#x27;s fair, like the one of the Emperor which was destroyed in 1887. But Napoleon III finally chose not to be crowned. Her diadem by the same jeweller is on display in the Louvre with a large diamond brooch by Alfred Bapst bearing two big Mazarin stones, as well as a large corsage diamond knot and a pearl and diamond shoulder brooch, both by François Kramer.

===Coronation sword===

The sword used during the coronation of the kings of France is displayed at the Louvre museum with its 13th-century scabbard, apart from the crown jewels. In the first part of the celebration, the king received the insignia of knighthood, consisting of spurs and the sword. Throughout the rest of the ceremony, the sword was entrusted to the &quot;Connétable&quot;, who held it with the blade pointing upwards. The treasury of Saint-Denis possessed several medieval swords including the one of Saint Louis. According to legend the coronation sword is &quot;Joyeuse&quot;, Charlemagne&#x27;s sword. Its unusual build and ornamentation makes it difficult to date, but the parts probably date back from the 10th to 13th centuries. Some believe it might be much older, even manufactured before Charlemagne&#x27;s reign.

The coronation swords of Napoleon I and Charles X also were preserved in the Louvre museum, although the first was transferred to the Palace of Fontainebleau with most of the preserved liturgical instruments and robes of the imperial ceremony and the latter stolen in 1976.

===Coronation spurs===
Some elements of the 12th to 16th centuries spurs were partially replaced for the coronation of Napoleon I.

===Sceptre of Charles V===

One of the few surviving pieces of the medieval French crown jewels is the sceptre that Charles V had made for the future coronation of his son, Charles VI, currently on display in the Louvre. It is over five feet long, and at the top is a lily supporting a small statuette of Charlemagne. This evocation of Charlemagne may also explain why this sceptre was included in the imperial regalia of Napoleon I.

The sceptre of Dagobert I was stolen in 1795 during the Revolution.

===&quot;Main de Justice&quot; (Hand of Justice)===

A typically French type of sceptre is the &quot;Main de Justice&quot; (Hand of Justice), which has as its finial an ivory Hand of God in a blessing gesture was recreated in 1804 for Napoleon I . The addition of cameos and other medieval gemstones, like the 12th-century ring of Saint Denis which surrounds the junction of the finial and the replaced rod, represents a deliberate 19th-century anachronism.

Another sceptre, the Baton of Guillaume de Roquemont, and the ring of Saint Louis are at the Louvre.

===Brooch of Saint Louis===
The collection keeps as well the 14th-century brooch or &quot;fermail&quot; said of Saint Louis, a large diamond shaped fibula bearing a fleur-de-lis in precious stones, which was used to hold the coronation&#x27;s robe.

===Serpentine paten===

The serpentine paten said to be of Abbot Suger of the 1st century BC or AD, associated with the Cup of the Ptolemies, was used at the coronation of queens and keeps its gem-studded gold Carolingian mountings of Charles the Bald.

===Famous diamonds===

Among the most famous diamonds preserved in the collection and now kept in the Apollo Gallery of the Louvre are the Sancy Diamond, which once had been part of the pre-Commonwealth Crown Jewels of England, the Hortensia pink diamond cut in 1678 for Louis XIV and above all the Regent Diamond. The treatment of the Regent Diamond epitomised the attitude of the French Royal Family to the Crown Jewels. While the Regent Diamond was the centrepiece of the King Louis XV crown, and worn by him at his coronation in February 1723, Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI, wore it in a black velvet hat. The Royal French Blue was transformed into the Hope Diamond now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C..

With two remaining jewels of the Renaissance, the &quot;Côte-de-Bretagne&quot; red spinel and the &quot;Dragon perle&quot;, a pin shaped into the form of a delphin, the crown jewels collection contains as well among others, the emerald set and pearl earrings of Empress Josephine, the micromosaic and the emerald and diamond sets of Empress Marie Louise, the pair of bracelets of rubies and the emerald diadem of the Duchess of Angoulême, the sapphire set of Queen Marie Amélie, a diamond cross of the Order of the Holy Spirit and a diamond portrait box of Louis XIV.

==Gemstones in the Natural History Museum and École des Mines==
Some gemstones and jewels are on display in the Treasury vault of the Mineralogy gallery in the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle. They include the Emerald of Saint Louis, the &#x27;Ruspoli&#x27; sapphire the Topaze (28.10 carats) and great Emerald (17 carats) of Louis XIV, the diamond pins of Queen Marie Antoinette, the Diamond-portrait (9.10 carats) and the Amethyst of Empress Marie Louise, the great Opal of Louis XVIII, the bicolor Sapphire (19.67 carats), the &quot;Jonquille&quot; diamond (9.75 carats) and more than 800 pearls and stones. Furthermore, a set of 1044 stones and pearls is kept at the École des Mines in Paris.

==Regalia in the National Library of France==
The Throne of Dagobert coming from Saint Denis can now be seen on the Richelieu site of the National Library of France. The Cup of the Ptolemies was used by the queens to take ablution after holy communion. This masterpieces among hardstone carvings or engraved gems of Antiquity, was carved with Dionysiac vignettes and emblems, probably in Alexandria during the 1st century BC or the 1st century AD. It was stolen in 1804, and recovered without its Carolingian gem-studded gold mountings. Its serpentine paten is at the Louvre.

==Charles X regalia in Saint Denis==
Some of the sovereign&#x27;s robes of the coronation of Charles X and regalia specially made by Feuchère for this event including the gilt-bronze Crown of Charles X (his coronation crown was destroyed by the Third Republic) and the Crown of Queen Marie Thérèse of Savoy are displayed in one of the chapels of the nave of the Basilica of Saint Denis with the funerary Regalia of king Louis XVIII (sceptre, hand of justice and copy of the sword and scabbard of Charlemagne). The Crown of the Dauphin Louis Antoine Duke of Angoulême which subsists as well counts too among the six only surviving French crowns.

==Liturgical instruments and robes in Reims==
The Holy Ampulla reconstituted with some recovered fragments of the original chrism for the coronation of Charles X in 1825, which was originally kept in the Abbey of Saint Remi, is now presented in the Palace of Tau next to the cathedral Notre-Dame de Reims with the coronation Chalice as well as several preserved sovereign&#x27;s robes and gowns of kings of the Ancien Régime and the liturgical instruments made for the coronation of Charles X. They are displayed with the few remaining pieces of the medieval treasure of the cathedral and the Talisman of Charlemagne, a large sapphire said to have been given by the Caliph Harun al-Rashid which was found in the Emperor&#x27;s grave in 1804 and later offered by Empress Eugenie. Since 1906, the content of the Holy Ampulla is kept in Reims archbishopric.

==Theft of the crown jewels during the Revolution==


The Crown Jewels were stolen in 1792 when the &quot;Garde Meuble&quot; (Royal Treasury) was stormed by rioters. Most, though not all, of the Crown Jewels were recovered eventually. Sancy Diamond was found in Russia at Vasily Rudanovsky collection. The Royal French Blue is believed to have been recut, and it is now known as the Hope Diamond.

The Hope is famously alleged to have been surrounded by bad luck. Marie Antoinette who supposedly wore it was beheaded (in fact, it was actually worn by her husband, Louis XVI, although he too was beheaded). Other owners and their families experienced suicides, marriage break-ups, bankruptcy, deaths in car crashes, falls off cliffs, revolutions, mental breakdowns, and deaths through drug overdoses. It was even tangentially associated with the case of the murdered Lindbergh baby, when its then owner, silver heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean, pawned it to raise money that she ended up paying to a con-man unconnected with the actual kidnapping. Most modern historians view the tales of a curse on the Hope to be spurious; the first mention of such tales is documented to 1908. Pierre Cartier, the Parisian jeweler, is widely credited with publicizing the stories of a curse on the diamond in hopes of increasing its saleability. Since 1958, it has been in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where it is the single most-viewed object in the Smithsonian&#x27;s collection. 

The Crown Jewels were augmented by jewels added by Napoleon I and Napoleon III.

==Last coronation==
The last French coronation occurred in 1825 when King Charles X was crowned at Reims. The scale of the coronation was seen by critics to indicate a return to the absolutism of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; that had been ended by the Revolution of 1789. Some historians suggest that the very grandeur of the ceremony marked the beginning of the end for the Bourbon monarchy, with Charles&#x27;s image as an old style monarch falling out of favour with the French public, who had much preferred the low-key monarchy of his brother, Louis XVIII. Louis Philippe I, the last French king, was not crowned, and neither was Napoleon III, the last Emperor. Napoleon III&#x27;s consort, Eugénie de Montijo, did have a crown made for her, though it was never used in an official coronation.

==Break-up and sale of the French crown jewels==

During the late 18th and 19th centuries the jewels survived the French First Republic, the Directorate, the First Empire, the Restoration, the July Monarchy, the French Second Republic and the Second Empire. However, the decision of Henri, Comte de Chambord not to accept the French Crown in the early 1870s ended not just the prospect of a royal restoration. It also led to the break-up and partial sale of the Crown Jewels. The Brazilian beauty Aimée de Heeren, WW2 secret service agent for President Getúlio Vargas was known for being the largest private owner of the French Crown jewels, along with other important jewelry. The jewels were presents from Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster who bought whatever he could find between the years 1939 and 1953.

In 1875, the French Third Republic came into being with the passage of a series of Constitutional Laws. The interim presidency was replaced by a full &quot;President of the Republic&quot;.

While few expected a royal restoration, certainly after the failure of the &quot;Seize Mai&quot; attempted royalist coup by the Marshal Patrice de MacMahon, sitting President of the French Republic, the continuing agitation of extreme right-wing royalists, and the fear of a royalist &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, led radical deputies to propose the sale of the Crown Jewels, in the hope that their dispersal would undermine the royalist cause: &quot;Without a crown, no need for a king&quot; in the words of one member of the National Assembly. This controversial decision was implemented. All the jewels from the Crown Jewels were removed and sold in 1887, as were many of the crowns, diadems, rings and other items. Only a few of the crowns were kept for historic reasons, but with their original diamonds and gems replaced by colored glass. Some historic or unusual gems went to French museums, including the Regent Diamond, the Hortensia diamond, and the corsage brooch containing some of the &#x27;Mazarin diamonds&#x27;, all of which now reside in the Louvre; and the &#x27;Ruspoli&#x27; sapphire, which is now in the French Natural History Museum (curators took advantage of its unusual rhombohedral faceted shape and asked for it to be exempted from the sale, falsely claiming that it was a natural, uncut crystal).

<doc id="1149172" wikidata="Q569907" url="?curid=1149172" title="Baotou">
<text>Baotou is the largest city by urban population in Inner Mongolia, China. Governed as a prefecture-level city, as of the 2020 census, its built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area made up of its 5 urban districts is home to 2,261,089 people with a total population of 2,709,378 accounting for counties under its jurisdiction. The city&#x27;s namesake, literally translated to &quot;place with deer&quot;, is of Mongolic origin or &quot;Lucheng&quot; (), meaning &quot;City of Deer&quot;. Alternatively Baotou is known as the &quot;City of Steel in Gobi&quot; (). Steel was a major industry in the city. Today, Baotou refines over half of the rare-earth minerals produced in the world. This has led to environmental contamination near the industrial sites.

==History==
===Ancient times===
The area now known as Baotou was inhabited by nomads, some of whose descendants would later be categorized as Mongols. Near the end of the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), Lü Bu, a particularly noteworthy warrior, was born in today&#x27;s Jiuyuan District of Baotou.

===Foundation of the town===
Compared to the capital of Inner Mongolia, Hohhot, Baotou&#x27;s construction as a city came relatively late, being incorporated as a town in 1809. The city&#x27;s site was chosen because it was in an arable region of the Yellow River&#x27;s Great Bend.

===Early 20th century===

The Gelaohui secret society and the Hui Muslim General Ma Fuxiang came to an agreement in 1922, in which Ma Fuxiang agreed to allow the Gelaohui to extort protection money from wool merchants in Baotou.

A railway from Beijing was constructed in 1923, and the city began spurring some industrial sites. A German-Chinese joint-venture in 1934 constructed the Baotou Airport and opened a weekly route connecting Baotou with Ningxia and Lanzhou.

When young Owen Lattimore visited Baotou in 1925, it was still &quot;a little husk of a town in a great hollow shell of mud ramparts, where two busy streets made a traders&#x27; quarter&quot;, but already an important railhead. Qinghai and Gansu wool and hides were brought down the Yellow River by raft and boat from Lanzhou to Baotou, and shipped from Baotou by rail to the east (in particular, to Tianjin for export). The river traffic was one-way only, however, as the fast current made sailing up the Yellow River impractical. To travel from Baotou back to Lanzhou or Yinchuan, one would use a cart and camel road. There were also caravan roads from Baotou to Ordos and the Alxa League.

====Second Sino-Japanese War====
Baotou was under Japanese control from 1937 until 1945.

====Chinese civil war====
On September 19, 1949, after the September 19 Rebellion, Baotou fell under Communist control. The People&#x27;s Government was formed in February 1950.

===Late 20th century===
In the early Communist years, Baotou served as an industrial centre, with a significant portion of its economy coming from its steel production. The Iron and Steel Base in Baotou is one of the &quot;156 projects&quot;, which were constructed with the help of the Soviet Union to develop China&#x27;s national economy in the 1950s and 1960s, and it continues this reputation until this day. Until the middle of the 1960s, the steel complex at Baotou was one of the rare examples of industrialization in the periphery of China.

====1996 earthquake====

On 3 May 1996, at 03:32AM UTC (11:32AM local time), an earthquake of MS 6.4 occurred. Since the epicenter of the earthquake was located close to the city, Baotou was very damaged by the earthquake: 26 people were killed, 453 injured and 196,633 lost their homes. The electrical infrastructure of the city was also damaged, and soil liquefaction occurred around the swamps of the Yellow River.

The earthquake, which destroyed many old houses, led to the reconstruction of Baotou. In 2002, the Baotou Municipal Government was awarded by UN-HABITAT for the improvements in shelter and the urban environments.

=== 21st century ===
In the early 21st century, Baotou&#x27;s economy grew rapidly, growing about tenfold from 2000 to 2010. The city&#x27;s gross domestic product peaked at about 386.763 billion renminbi (RMB) in 2016, and has shrunk significantly since then.

==Economy==
Baotou is the largest economy of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and accounted for approximately 21.3% of Inner Mongolia&#x27;s total gross domestic product (GDP) as of 2012. As of 2018, the city&#x27;s GDP is 295.180 billion renminbi (RMB), a 7.22% increase from the previous year, but much lower than the city&#x27;s peak of 386.763 billion RMB in 2016.

Baotou&#x27;s secondary sector has proven crucial to the city&#x27;s economy. As of 2016, it contributed 182.215 RMB to the city&#x27;s economy, 47.11% of the city&#x27;s total GDP. However, like the city&#x27;s total economy, it has shrunk since then. As of 2020, the city&#x27;s secondary sector contributed 115.300 billion RMB to Baotou&#x27;s economy.

Baotou Xingsheng Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone is an industrial zone in Baotou.

As noted, in the early Communist years Baotou served as an industrial centre, with a significant portion of its economy coming from its industry around metals, mostly steel. The Iron and Steel Base of Bautou was constructed with the help of the Soviet Union to help China in developing its economy; it was one of the &quot;156 Projects&quot; that the Soviets helped build for that purpose in the 1950s and 1960s.

Baotou is a major center for rare-earth metals. Rare-earth minerals from the Bayan Obo Mining District, about 120 kilometres from Baotou, are processed in the city. They are used in many electrical and electronic devices, such as smartphones, TVs, wind turbines, and electric vehicle motors. The toxic byproducts from the refineries are contained by the Baotou Tailings Dam.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 Chinese Census, Baotou has a permanent population of about 2,709,400 people, up about 59,000 from the 2010 Census. The average household in Baotou comprises 2.27 people, down from 2.65 as of 2010.

=== Age and sex distribution ===
Baotou, like many places in China, has an aging population. As per the 2020 Census, 20.19% of Baotou&#x27;s population is aged 60 and older, 1.49 percentage points above the Chinese national average of 18.70%. 13.70% of Baotou&#x27;s population is aged 65 and older, 0.20 percentage points above the Chinese national average of 13.50%. The number of people aged 60 and older has grown by 7.42% since 2010, and the number of people aged 65 and older has grown by 4.88% during that same span.

Per the census, 50.7% of the city&#x27;s population is male, and 49.3% is female.

=== Ethnic groups ===
=== Floating population ===
As of 2020, there are approximately 1,026,400 floating residents of Baotou, that is, residents of the city with a hukou registration elsewhere. This population has increased by 144,100, or 22.37%, since 2010.

=== Urbanization ===
As of the 2020 Census, 2,334,400 people, or 86.16% of the city&#x27;s population, lives in urban areas. The remaining 375,000 people, 13.84% of the city&#x27;s population, lives in rural areas.

==Prominent locations==
*The 39,000 capacity Baotou Olympic Sports Centre Stadium() is the main sports venue in the city and is used mostly for football matches.

*Saihantalah Grasslands Park () or Ecological Reserve is a large urban park in central Baotou, in the Qingshan district. The 5.5 km square park is home to thirty wild animal and bird species and is reputedly one of the largest urban parks in China. It is a popular recreational location and attracts 2 million visitors a year.
*The largest Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Inner Mongolia, Badekar Monastery is located in Shiguai District.
*The Baotou Tailings Dam or Weikuang Dam is a tailings dam about 20 kilometres outside the main city of Baotou. It is owned by Baotou Steel and contains the toxic waste from rare-earth mineral refineries. Since as early as 2012, there have been reports of serious contamination of the surrounding environment.

==Transportation==

==Geography and climate==
Baotou is located in the west of Inner Mongolia, located at the junction of two economic zones: the Bohai Economic Rim and the Upper Yellow River Natural Resources Enrichment Zone (). Its administrative area borders Mongolia&#x27;s Dornogovi Province to the north, while the Yellow River, which flows for in the prefecture, is south of the urban area itself. The Tumochuan Plateau (), Hetao Plateau, and Yin Mountains cross the urban area and central part of the prefecture. Baotou City ranges in latitude from 41° 20&#x27; to 42° 40&#x27; N and in longitude from 109° 50&#x27; to 111° 25&#x27; E.

Baotou features a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), marked by long, cold and very dry winters, hot, somewhat humid summers, and strong winds, especially in spring. Temperatures often fall below in winter and rise above in summer. The annual precipitation is approximately , with more than half of it falling in July and August alone. Due to the aridity and elevation, temperature differences between day and night can be large, especially in spring. In 2002, there were 12 instances of dust storms. Temperature extremes recorded since 1951 range from on 27 January 1971 (though an unofficial record low of on 23 December 1935) to on 22 June 2005.

== Administrative divisions ==
Baotou is divided into 10 county-level divisions, including 7 districts, 1 county and 2 banners.

<text>The National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education (NITLE) was a &quot;community-based, non-profit initiative&quot; to &quot;help liberal arts colleges and universities integrate inquiry, pedagogy, and technology&quot;. It was established in September 2001.

Its stated mission was to catalyze &quot;innovative teaching in order to enrich and advance liberal education in the digital age.&quot; The initiative provided programs and services that promote inter-institutional collaboration and innovative uses of technology at small, undergraduate-centered, residential colleges and universities.
==History==
NITLE was established in September 2001, through a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The original charge of this grant-funded initiative was to stimulate collaboration between selected liberal arts colleges and to act as a catalyst for the effective integration of emerging and newer digital technologies into teaching, learning, scholarship, and information management at those colleges.

In January, 2006, NITLE reorganized under Ithaka, bringing together and merging with three other Mellon-funded instructional technology initiatives: the Center for Educational Technology at Middlebury College, the Associated Colleges of the South Technology Center, and the Midwest Instructional Technology Center (associated with the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Associated Colleges of the Midwest). The reorganization merged NITLE and the three regional technology centers into a unified, national initiative for providing instructional technology programs for providers of liberal education in the United States. The reformed organization continued to receive grant support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

==Location==
From 2009 to 2015 NITLE was hosted at Southwestern University , a small, private liberal arts college in Georgetown, Texas. Staff was distributed across several states. In 2015, NITLE migrated its operations to the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), headquartered in Washington, D.C. The Institute closed in 2018. 

==Core program areas==
The organization delivered a methodology that provided colleges and institutions with the traction they needed to move forward to meet stated strategic collaboration objectives. The program engaged targeted groups of institutions that had already identified – or were actively in the process of identifying—shared needs and objectives, and complementary strengths. The methodology guided participants through the process of identifying how to maximize the benefits of partnerships by using collaborative processes and tools to achieve specifically defined common objectives.

<doc id="1149178" wikidata="Q514823" url="?curid=1149178" title="Cushing reflex">
<text>Cushing reflex (also referred to as the vasopressor response, the Cushing effect, the Cushing reaction, the Cushing phenomenon, the Cushing response, or Cushing&#x27;s Law) is a physiological nervous system response to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that results in Cushing&#x27;s triad of increased blood pressure, irregular breathing, and bradycardia. It is usually seen in the terminal stages of acute head injury and may indicate imminent brain herniation. It can also be seen after the intravenous administration of epinephrine and similar drugs. It was first described in detail by American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1901.

== Definition ==

The Cushing reflex classically presents as an increase in systolic and pulse pressure, reduction of the heart rate (bradycardia), and irregular respiration. It is caused by increased pressure inside the skull. These symptoms can be indicative of insufficient blood flow to the brain (ischemia) as well as compression of arterioles.

In response to rising intracranial pressure (ICP), respiratory cycles change in regularity and rate. Different patterns indicate a different location of the brain where the injury occurred. The increase in ventilation is exhibited as an increase in rate rather than depth of ventilation, so the Cushing reflex is often associated with slow, irregular breathing. As a result of the now defective regulation of heart rate and blood pressure, the physiologic response is decreased blood flow peripherally, which can present as Mayer waves. These are simply pathologic waves seen in HR tracings (i.e., arterial lines, electrocardiograph (ECG, etc.), which reflect decreased intravascular blood flow. This decreased flow often causes reflexive vasoconstriction, which leads to an overall increase in blood pressure despite the actual decrease in intravascular volume.

==Differential diagnosis==

Whenever a Cushing reflex occurs, there is a high probability of death in seconds to minutes. As a result, a Cushing reflex indicates a need for immediate care. Since its presence is a good detector of high ICP, it is often useful in the medical field, particularly during surgery. During any neurosurgery being performed on the brain, there is always a likelihood that raised intracranial pressure may occur. Early recognition of this is crucial to the well being of the patient. Although direct measurement of ICP is possible, it is not always accurate. In the past, physicians and nurses have relied on hemodynamic changes or bradycardia, the late phase of the reflex, to identify the ICP increase. Once the initial stage of the Cushing reflex (bradycardia combined with hypertension) was discovered, it offered a much more reliable and swift warning sign of high ICP. It was found that hypertension and bradycardia occurred 93% of the time when cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) dropped below 15 mmHg due to raised ICP. Also, the Cushing reflex is known to arise only from acute prolonged raises in ICP. Thus, it can be used as a tool by physicians to differentiate acute and chronic rises in ICP.

It has also been reported that the presence of a Cushing reflex due to an ICP increase could allow one to conclude that ischemia has occurred in the posterior cranial fossa. Finally, the Cushing reflex may be one of many ways to identify if a patient has rejected a transplanted organ. Aside from the innate autoimmune response, ischemia in the cranial region has been detected with a transplanted organ that is being rejected. As such, the presence of a Cushing reflex due to ICP can indicate that ischemia may be occurring due to foreign organ rejection.

As first postulated by Harvey Cushing, raised intracranial pressure is the primary cause of the Cushing reflex. Furthermore, continued moderate increases in cranial pressure allows for the Cushing reflex to occur. In contrast, rapid and dramatic pressure rises do not allow for the mechanism of the reflex to sufficiently take place. Elevated intracranial pressure can result from numerous pathways of brain impairment, including: subarachnoid hemorrhages, ischemia, meningitis, trauma, including concussions, hypoxia, tumors, and stroke. In one study, it was confirmed that raised ICP due to subarachnoid hemorrhaging causes mechanical distortion of the brainstem, specifically the medulla. Due to the mechanism of the Cushing reflex, brainstem distortion is then swiftly followed by sympathetic nervous system over activity. In addition, during typical neurosurgical procedures on patients, especially those involving neuroendoscopic techniques, frequent washing of the ventricles have been known to cause high intracranial pressure. The Cushing reflex can also result from low CPP, specifically below 15 mmHg. CPP normally falls between 70-90 mmHg in an adult human, and 60-90 mmHg in children.

Brain plateau wave changes are also associated with the Cushing reflex. These waves are characterized by acute rises of the ICP, and are accompanied by a decrease of the cerebral perfusion pressure. It has been found that if a Cushing reflex occurs, brain plateau wave changes can be erased due to disappearance of high ICP.

==Mechanism==
The Cushing reflex is complex and seemingly paradoxical. The reflex begins when some event causes increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Since cerebrospinal fluid is located in an area surrounded by the skull, increased ICP consequently increases the pressure in the fluid itself. The pressure in the cerebral spinal fluid eventually rises to the point that it meets and gradually exceeds the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). When the ICP exceeds the MAP, arterioles located in the brain&#x27;s cerebrum become compressed. Compression then results in diminished blood supply to the brain, a condition known as cerebral ischemia.

During the increase in ICP, both the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system are activated. In the first stage of the reflex, sympathetic nervous system stimulation is much greater than parasympathetic stimulation. The sympathetic response activates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing constriction of the body&#x27;s arteries. This constriction raises the total resistance of blood flow, elevating blood pressure to high levels, which is known as hypertension. The body&#x27;s induced hypertension is an attempt to restore blood flow to the ischemic brain. The sympathetic stimulation also increases the rate of heart contractions and cardiac output. Increased heart rate is also known as tachycardia. This combined with hypertension is the first stage of the Cushing reflex.

Meanwhile, baroreceptors in the aortic arch detect the increase in blood pressure and trigger a parasympathetic response via the vagus nerve. This induces bradycardia, or slowed heart rate, and signifies the second stage of the reflex. Bradycardia may also be caused by increased ICP due to direct mechanical distortion of the vagus nerve and subsequent parasympathetic response. Furthermore, this reflexive increase in parasympathetic activity is thought to contribute to the formation of Cushing ulcers in the stomach, due to uncontrolled activation of the parietal cells. The blood pressure can be expected to remain higher than the pressure of the raised cerebral spinal fluid to continue to allow blood to flow to the brain. The pressure rises to the point where it overcomes the resisting pressure of the compressed artery, and blood is allowed through, providing oxygen to the hypoxic area of the brain. If the increase in blood pressure is not sufficient to compensate for the compression on the artery, infarction occurs.

Raised ICP, tachycardia, or some other endogenous stimulus can result in distortion and/or increased pressure on the brainstem. Since the brainstem controls involuntary breathing, changes in its homeostasis often results in irregular respiratory pattern and/or apnea. This is the third and final stage of the reflex.

The role of the central chemoreceptors in the Cushing reflex is unclear. In most normal pressure responses the chemoreceptors and baroreceptors work together to increase or decrease blood pressure. In the Cushing reflex, the central chemoreceptors are likely involved in the detection of ischemia, contributing to the sympathetic surge and hypertension in the first phase of the reflex, and work in opposition to the baroreceptors, contributing to the combined high sympathetic and parasympathetic activation.

===Function===

Raised intracranial pressure can ultimately result in the shifting or crushing of brain tissue, which is detrimental to the physiological well-being of patients. As a result, the Cushing reflex is a last-ditch effort by the body to maintain homeostasis in the brain. It is widely accepted that the Cushing reflex acts as a baroreflex, or homeostatic mechanism for the maintenance of blood pressure, in the cranial region. Specifically, the reflex mechanism can maintain normal cerebral blood flow and pressure under stressful situations such as ischemia or subarachnoid hemorrhages. A case report of a patient who underwent a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated that the Cushing reflex played a part in maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow. Eventually, the ICP drops to a level range where a state of induced hypertension in the form of the Cushing reflex is no longer required. The Cushing reflex was then aborted, and CPP was maintained. It has also been shown that an increase in mean arterial pressure due to hypertension, characteristic of the reflex, can cause the normalization of CPP. This effect is protective, especially during increased intracranial pressure, which creates a drop in CPP.

==Cushing&#x27;s triad==
Cushing&#x27;s triad refers to when all of these symptoms are seen together:
*Irregular, decreased respirations (caused by impaired brainstem function)
*Bradycardia
*Systolic hypertension (with widening pulse pressure)
It is associated with an increase in intracranial pressure.

==History==

Cushing&#x27;s reflex is named after Harvey Williams Cushing (1869–1939), an American neurosurgeon. Cushing began his research in Bern, Switzerland studying abroad with Emil Theodor Kocher. A month into his trip, Cushing received a formal proposition from Emil Theodor Kocher to begin testing how compression of the brain affected blood vessels. Cushing also enlisted the aid of Hugo Kronecker, a known blood pressure researcher. Utilizing Kroenecker&#x27;s assistance and resources, Cushing began his research. Cushing left Bern in 1901 to work in Turin, Italy with Angelo Mosso, a previous student of Kroenecker. He continued to work on the same research project, while also simultaneously improving his methods of recording coincidence of blood pressure and ICP. In June 1901 Cushing published his first paper through Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin entitled &quot;Concerning a definite regulatory mechanism of the vasomotor centre which controls blood pressure during cerebral compression&quot;. Between 1901 and 1903, Cushing published five papers pertaining to his research on the vasopressor response. These papers were published in German and English, and one was authored by Emil Theodor Kocher.

===Experimental setup and results===
Cushing began experimenting once he obtained approval from Kocher. His experimental setup was a modified version of Leonard Hill&#x27;s model to similarly test the effects of brain pressure on sinus pressure, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, arterial and venous blood pressure. Like Hill, Cushing used dogs for his experiments. To begin, Cushing monitored the caliber and color of cortical vessels by fitting a glass window into the skull of the dog. Intracranial pressure was raised by filling an intracranial, soft, rubber bag with mercury. Cushing recorded the intracranial pressure along with blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate simultaneously. This three part effect is commonly referred to as Cushing&#x27;s triad. In later experiments performed by Mosso, intracranial pressure was induced by injecting physiological saline into the subarachnoid space rather than increasing mercury content of an intracranial bag.

This research clearly displayed the cause and effect relationship between intracranial pressure and cerebral compression. Cushing noted this relationship in his subsequent publications. He also noted that there must exist a specific regulatory mechanism that increased blood pressure to a high enough point such that it did not create anemic conditions. Cushing&#x27;s publications contain his observations and no statistical analysis. The sample size of the experiment is also not known.

===Other researchers===
Several notable figures in the medical field, including Ernst von Bergmann, Henri Duret, Friedrich Jolly, and others experimented with intracranial pressure similarly to Cushing. Some of these researchers published similar findings concerning the relationship of intracranial pressure to arterial blood pressure before Cushing had begun experimenting. Cushing studied this relationship more carefully and offered an improved explanation of the relationship.

Some controversy concerning plagiarism does surround some of Cushing&#x27;s research. Bernhard Naunyn, a German pathologist and contemporary of Cushing, made remarks claiming that Cushing neither cited him in Cushing&#x27;s research nor expanded on any of the results that he had found in his original experiments.

==Research directions==

Although a lot of progress has been made since 1901 when Harvey Cushing first expanded knowledge of what is now known as the Cushing reflex, there are still many aspects of the research that remain to be seen. The exact pathogenesis of the disease remains undetermined. The possibility that intracranial pressure (ICP) may not be the sole cause of the Cushing reflex per se came from an occurrence of Cushing blood pressure response occurring before increased ICP. Some research observed symptoms of Cushing reflex, without the usual increased ICP and medullary anemia, suggesting other causes that still require research. Axial brain stem distortion could be the pathogenesis of Cushing reflex.

The nature of receptors mediating the Cushing response is also unknown. Some research suggests the existence of intracranial baroreceptors to trigger specific Cushing baroreceptor reflex. Experiments by Schmidt and his fellow researchers showed that the Cushing reflex is directed by autonomic nervous system, since its physiological change has to do with the balance of the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. However, the specific relation between the autonomic nervous system response and the Cushing reflex and its symptoms has yet to be identified.

It has been determined that rate of respiration is affected by the Cushing reflex, though the respiratory changes induced are still an area that needs more research. Some researchers have reported apnea, while others have reported increased respiratory rates. Other researchers have found that increases in respiratory rate follow ICP decreases, while others say it is a response to ICP increase. One must also take into account the use of anesthetics in early experimentation. Research was initially performed on animals or patients under anesthesia. The anesthesia used in experiments have led to respiratory depression, which might have had effect on the results. Early experiments also put animal subjects under artificial ventilation, only allowing for limited conclusions about respiration in the Cushing reflex. The use of anesthetics proposes ideas for future research, since the creation of the Cushing response has been difficult to create under basal conditions or without anesthesia.

Some researchers have also suggested a long-term effect of the Cushing reflex. Thus far it has only been observed as an immediate acute response, but there has been some evidence to suggest that its effects could be prolonged, such as a long-term raise in blood pressure. Heightened sensitivity of neurological response systems leading to arterial hypertension is also possible, but has not been examined.

Although the Cushing reflex was primarily identified as a physiological response when blood flow has almost ceased, its activity has also been seen in fetal life. This activity has not been thoroughly investigated, so there is a need for more research in this area.

The underlying mechanisms of the reflex on a cellular level are yet to be discovered, and will likely be the next area of research if scientists and or doctors chose to do so.

<doc id="1149193" wikidata="Q270019" url="?curid=1149193" title="7 Seconds (band)">
<text>7 Seconds (stylized as 7Seconds) is an American hardcore punk band from Reno, Nevada, that was formed in 1980 by two sets of brothers. The band has gone through numerous lineup changes over the subsequent years, with only Kevin Seconds, Steve Youth and Bobby Adams remaining constant members.

The current lineup of 7 Seconds consists of Kevin Seconds (vocals), Steve Youth (bass), Troy Mowat (drums), and Bobby Adams (guitar).

== History ==
=== Formation ===
7 Seconds was formed on January 17, 1980, by two sets of brothers; the Marvelli brothers, using the punk rock names &quot;Kevin Seconds&quot; and &quot;Steve Youth&quot;, and the Borghino brothers, who were known as &quot;Tom Munist&quot; and &quot;Dim Menace&quot;.

Asked about the origins of the band&#x27;s name in a December 1982 interview with &quot;Flipside&quot; magazine, Kevin Seconds recalled:
&quot;...I was ordering The Dils single &#x27;198 Seconds of The Dils&#x27; from Bomp and I wrote it on a desk and the ink it said 97 Seconds; and then we saw this movie &quot;Day of the Jackals&quot; or something and all through it there were references to 7 Seconds, and the Dils were like our idols... So we were looking for a name and we were looking at this racing book and it said 7 seconds and we said, &#x27;fuck it, must be an omen,&#x27; so we picked it. It&#x27;s a short, intense name.&quot;

This story evolved over time. In the February 2005 issue of &quot;AMP&quot;, in an article titled, &quot;7 Seconds: 25 Years of Our Core&quot;, Kevin Seconds told this tale:
&quot;We were big fans of The Dils, they had this EP, 198 Seconds of The Dils and I was so in love with punk rock that I would just write album titles on my clothes. This was still when Steve and I lived with my mom. We had this desk in this room we shared and I wrote &#x27;197 seconds of The Dils,&#x27; I miswrote the title. Over time, everything else faded, but the 7 Seconds part was there, and I circled it, I thought it looked cool.&quot;
In 1981, Munist and Menace left to form a new band called Section 8.

=== Recording history ===
7 Seconds has floated across several genres of rock.

The band&#x27;s early releases were several EPs including 1982&#x27;s &quot;Skins, Brains and Guts&quot;, most of which were later re-released on the &quot;alt.music.hardcore&quot; and &quot;Old School&quot; compilation CDs. All three demos were released on a bootleg release named &quot;7 Seconds – Hardcore Rules, 80-82&quot;. They also appeared on the 1985 hardcore compilation &quot;Cleanse the Bacteria&quot;, in addition to numerous other compilations, such as &quot;Not So Quiet On the Western Front&quot; (Alt. Tentacles, 1982), &quot;Something to Believe In&quot; (BYO, 1984), &quot;Party or Go Home&quot;/&quot;We Got Power&quot; (Mystic, 1983), and &quot;Nuke Your Dink&quot; (Positive Force, 1984). They became closely associated with the Straight Edge movement and helped start the Youth Crew movement in 1984 with The Crew.

Their first full-length album, &quot;The Crew&quot;, was recorded in 1983–84 and released by BYO Records, as was its successor – 1985&#x27;s EP &quot;Walk Together, Rock Together&quot;, which was expanded the next year into a full length album with live tracks on the b-side. With the &quot;New Wind&quot; album, the band dramatically expanded its sound and style with audible elements of a sometimes quieter, slower, more melodic and accessible sound. Many writers have credited this particular period of 7 Seconds&#x27; career as being highly influential on many pop punk and indie rock bands that came along much later.

Subsequent LPs moved deeper into mainstream territory with a U2-like sound. The &quot;7 Seconds&quot; album continued their musical experimentation. The band broke free in 1995 with &quot;The Music, The Message&quot;, moving back somewhat into their roots. &quot;The Music, The Message&quot; was released on Sony (BMI), the first release on a major label throughout the band&#x27;s history. Earlier material was on various homegrown labels, completely self-produced, or put out on Kevin Seconds own label, Positive Force Records (AKA United Front), before BYO Records housed them. However, the band returned to an old-school hardcore sound in 1999 with the &quot;Good to Go&quot; album. 2005 came the release of &quot;Take It Back, Take It On, Take It Over!&quot; on SideOneDummy, completing the evolution back to their Hardcore roots.

=== Legacy ===
7 Seconds is believed to be the first band to refer to themselves primarily as hardcore. After their first show on March 2, 1980, in Newsletter NWIN/SPUNK No. 1 they described their band as hardcore new wave.
Vocalist Kevin Seconds has gone on to have a lengthy solo career, becoming an important folk punk singer too, doing releases with people including Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio and Mike Scott of Lay It on the Line.

Dim Menace&#x27;s fist-brandishing scowl on the cover of the &quot;Skins, Brains, &amp; Guts&quot; EP is one of the most iconic images in hardcore. Sacramento News &amp; Review speaks at length of their influence in the positive hardcore movement and their positive effect on the punk culture.

In May 2013 it was announced that 7 Seconds had signed to Rise Records, with plans to record a new 7&quot; and a full-length album that summer in Sacramento.

=== Break up ===
On March 20, 2018, 7 Seconds announced their breakup via their official Facebook page.

=== Reunion and 2022 North American Tour ===
On October 4, 2021, 7 Seconds announced via Facebook that they will return were going on tour in 2022 alongside Circle Jerks (headliner) and Negative Approach (opener). For health reasons, longtime drummer Troy Mowat did not join the band. His replacement for the tour was Sammy Siegler (Youth of Today, Judge). On 2024, the band announces via Facebook that they will be present on This is Hardcore festival along with Black Flag.

<doc id="1149194" wikidata="Q3229679" url="?curid=1149194" title="Leonard Michaels">
<text>Leonard Michaels (January 2, 1933 – May 10, 2003) was an American writer of short stories, novels, and essays, and a Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Early life and education==
Michaels was born in New York City to Jewish parents; his father was born in Poland. He attended New York University and was awarded a BA degree, and then went on to earn an MA and PhD in English literature from the University of Michigan. After receiving his doctorate, Leonard Michaels moved to Berkeley, California, where he was to spend most of his adult life and become Professor of English at the University of California. 

==Literary career==
In 1969, Michael&#x27;s first book was published – &quot;Going Places&quot;, a collection of short stories.

His follow-up book, another collection of short stories, was &quot;I Would Have Saved Them If I Could&quot;, published in 1975. It was considered by some as strong as Michaels&#x27; .
Michaels&#x27; first novel, released in 1981, was &quot;The Men&#x27;s Club&quot;. It is story-like comedy that simultaneously attacks and celebrates the absurdities of men as they gather in a kind of urban support group. In 1986, the novel was made into a film, directed by Peter Medak, with the screenplay by Michaels, and starring Roy Scheider, Harvey Keitel, Stockard Channing, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Frank Langella.

Michaels&#x27; second and last novel was published in 1992. Titled &quot;Sylvia&quot;, it is a fictionalized memoir of his first wife, Sylvia Bloch, who died by suicide. Sylvia is described in the book as &quot;abnormally bright&quot; but prone to violent rages, &quot;like a madwoman imitating a college student.&quot; &quot;Sylvia&quot; incorporates passages from Michaels&#x27; diary, a selection of which was published under the title &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; in 1999.

Michaels became a regular contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in the 1990s.

===Sylvia Bloch===
Sylvia Bloch was born 1939 in Switzerland. Her father, Alfred Bloch, born in Gailingen, Germany on August 8, 1904, was a chemist who worked for Fuller Brush. Her mother was Else Sondhelm, born in Dresden, Germany in 1916. The family immigrated to New York in 1939 and lived in Highland Park, New Jersey.

==Other information==
Michaels was a Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley.

He took part in anti-Vietnam war protests in the San Francisco Bay area, although he also accepted a description of himself as an &#x27;unpolitical man&#x27;.

He is interred at Oakmont Memorial Park, in Lafayette, California.

Michaels had a daughter with his third wife, the poet Brenda Hillman. His son Jesse Michaels (from his second marriage) was the vocalist and primary lyricist in the seminal underground punk rock band Operation Ivy in the late 1980s

<doc id="1149195" wikidata="Q4569895" url="?curid=1149195" title="1960 American Football League draft">
<text>The 1960 American Football League draft was held on November 22–23, 1959, in Minneapolis, shortly after the organization of the league, and lasted 33 rounds. An additional draft of 20 rounds was held by the AFL on December 2.

Teams were required to fill the 11 squad positions by selecting four backs, two ends, two tackles, two guards, and a center with their first 11 picks. Before each position was selected, teams drew lots to determine the selection order. Though professional teams used dedicated offensive and defensive units, the league did not want to go 22 rounds before starting unrestricted drafting.

==Territorial draft==
The first territorial or &quot;bonus&quot; picks for each team were:

* Boston Patriots ~ Gerhard Schwedes, HB, Syracuse
* Buffalo Bills ~ Richie Lucas, QB, Penn State
* Dallas Texans ~ Don Meredith, QB, SMU
* Denver Broncos ~ Roger LeClerc, C, Trinity
* Houston Oilers ~ Billy Cannon, HB, LSU
* Los Angeles Chargers ~ Monty Stickles, E, Notre Dame
* Titans of New York ~ George Izo, QB, Notre Dame
* Minneapolis AFL team 1 ~ Dale Hackbart, QB, Wisconsin

==Allocation draft==
For the &quot;allocation draft&quot;, the other seven AFL teams each froze eleven players, and Oakland selected a total of 24 players from the ranks of the other teams&#x27; &quot;unfrozen&quot; lists. The number of players originally drafted for the eighth AFL franchise, but who were signed by other teams, combined with the process of the &quot;allocation draft&quot;, virtually guaranteed that the Raiders would have the worst team in the AFL in its first year. In spite of this, they managed to sign future stars Jim Otto and Wayne Hawkins, two men who played the entire ten years of the American Football League.

<text>King Bunseo (died 304, r. 298–304) was the tenth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
He was the eldest son of King Chaekgye. He became king upon Chaekgye&#x27;s death in 298 when he was killed in battle during the 13th year of his reign. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that &quot;from his youth he was bright and intelligent, and in his performance of rites he was bold and upright. His father the king loved him, and never separated him from his side&quot;.

==Reign==
He continued to wage war against the Chinese Lelang commandery whose forces had killed his father. In 304, he captured a western district of the Lelang commandery. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, the governor of the commandery thereupon sent an assassin who killed him.

Samguk sagi:
* 298 AD, winter, tenth month. There was a great amnesty.

<text>Dan Spring (22 July 1910 – 6 September 1988) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Kerry North constituency from 1943 to 1981. He was a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government from 1956 to 1957. He was the father of Dick Spring, who led the Labour Party from 1982 to 1997.

==Early life==
Spring was born into a working-class family in Tralee, County Kerry in 1910. He left school at the age of 14 and began his working life with a series of low-skilled jobs. When he was working at a mill, he became involved in the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU) and after a while became a trade union official. He married Anna Laide (1919–1997) in 1944, and they had six children.

==Sporting career==
Spring was a Gaelic football player, and was the captain of the Tralee Kerins O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s team with whom he won two Kerry Senior Football Championship titles in 1933 and 1939. He first played with Kerry when he won Munster and All-Ireland Junior titles in 1930. He later joined the senior team where he won All-Ireland titles in 1939 and captain of the side when they won the All-Ireland final in 1940.

==Politics==
He was elected to both Tralee Urban District Council (topping the poll) and Kerry County Council, representing the Labour Party in 1942. Through his involvement with the ITGWU he became well known enough to stand in Kerry North for the Labour Party at the 1943 general election. He was elected as the first Labour Party Teachta Dála (TD) for Kerry and held his seat until he retired in 1981.

In 1944, Spring was among a group of six TDs who broke away from the Labour Party because it was allegedly infiltrated by communists and formed a new party they called the National Labour Party. The Labour Party and the National Labour Party reunited in 1950, having worked alongside each other in the First inter-party government since 1948.

In 1956, during the term of the Second inter-party government Spring was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, which he held until the government ended in 1957.

For the rest of his political career Spring never held any significant post on a national level, and as a relatively conservative rural Labour man he fell out of step with the official line of the Labour Party, which moved significantly to the left during the 1960s and 1970s. During a vote on contraception, Spring famously said that on the day of the vote, his constituents would see how he stood on the issue. On the day of the vote, he appeared as a barrister in a court far away from the Dáil. Spring concentrated on his constituency work and was returned in every election he stood in until he retired in 1981, his son Dick then successfully contesting the seat.

<doc id="1149201" wikidata="Q254040" url="?curid=1149201" title="Egyptian numerals">
<text>The system of ancient Egyptian numerals was used in Ancient Egypt from around 3000 BC until the early first millennium AD. It was a system of numeration based on multiples of ten, often rounded off to the higher power, written in hieroglyphs. The Egyptians had no concept of a positional notation such as the decimal system. The hieratic form of numerals stressed an exact finite series notation, ciphered one-to-one onto the Egyptian alphabet.

==Digits and numbers==
The following hieroglyphs were used to denote powers of ten:
Multiples of these values were expressed by repeating the symbol as many times as needed. For instance, a stone carving from Karnak shows the number 4,622 as:
Egyptian hieroglyphs could be written in both directions (and even vertically). In this example the symbols decrease in value from top to bottom and from left to right. On the original stone carving, it is right-to-left, and the signs are thus reversed.

== Zero ==

There was no symbol or concept of zero as a placeholder in Egyptian numeration and zero was not used in calculations. However, the symbol nefer (&quot;nfr&quot;𓄤, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;) was apparently also used for two numeric purposes:
* in a papyrus listing the court expenses, , it indicated a zero balance;
* in a drawing for Meidum Pyramid (and at other sites), nefer is used to indicate a ground level: height and depths are measured &quot;above nefer&quot; or &quot;below nefer&quot; respectively.
According to Carl Boyer, a deed from Edfu contained a &quot;zero concept&quot; replacing the magnitude in geometry.

==Fractions==
Rational numbers could also be expressed, but only as sums of unit fractions, &quot;i.e.&quot;, sums of reciprocals of positive integers, except for and . The hieroglyph indicating a fraction looked like a mouth, which meant &quot;part&quot;:

Fractions were written with this fractional solidus, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the numerator 1, and the positive denominator below. Thus, was written as:

Special symbols were used for and for the non-unit fractions and, less frequently, :

If the denominator became too large, the &quot;mouth&quot; was just placed over the beginning of the &quot;denominator&quot;:
==Written numbers==
As with most modern day languages, the ancient Egyptian language could also write out numerals as words phonetically, just like one can write &quot;thirty&quot; instead of &quot;30&quot; in English. The word (&quot;thirty&quot;), for instance, was written as

while the numeral (&quot;30&quot;) was
This was, however, uncommon for most numbers other than one and two and the signs were used most of the time.

==Hieratic numerals==
As administrative and accounting texts were written on papyrus or ostraca, rather than being carved into hard stone (as were hieroglyphic texts), the vast majority of texts employing the Egyptian numeral system utilize the hieratic script. Instances of numerals written in hieratic can be found as far back as the Early Dynastic Period. The Old Kingdom Abusir Papyri are a particularly important corpus of texts that utilize hieratic numerals.

Boyer proved 50 years ago that hieratic script used a different numeral system, using individual signs for the numbers 1 to 9, multiples of 10 from 10 to 90, the hundreds from 100 to 900, and the thousands from 1000 to 9000. A large number like 9999 could thus be written with only four signs—combining the signs for 9000, 900, 90, and 9—as opposed to 36 hieroglyphs. Boyer saw the new hieratic numerals as ciphered, mapping one number onto one Egyptian letter for the first time in human history. Greeks adopted the new system, mapping their counting numbers onto two of their alphabets, the Doric and Ionian.

In the oldest hieratic texts the individual numerals were clearly written in a ciphered relationship to the Egyptian alphabet. But during the Old Kingdom a series of standardized writings had developed for sign-groups containing more than one numeral, repeated as Roman numerals practiced. However, repetition of the same numeral for each place-value was not allowed in the hieratic script. As the hieratic writing system developed over time, these sign-groups were further simplified for quick writing; this process continued into Demotic, as well.

Two famous mathematical papyri using hieratic script are the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.

==Egyptian words for numbers==
The following table shows the reconstructed Middle Egyptian forms of the numerals (which are indicated by a preceding asterisk), the transliteration of the hieroglyphs used to write them, and finally the Coptic numerals which descended from them and which give Egyptologists clues as to the vocalism of the original Egyptian numbers. A breve (˘) in some reconstructed forms indicates a short vowel whose quality remains uncertain; the letter &#x27;e&#x27; represents a vowel that was originally u or i (exact quality uncertain) but became e by Late Egyptian.

<text>The Azanian People&#x27;s Organisation (AZAPO) is a South African liberation movement and political party. The organisation&#x27;s two student wings are the Azanian Students&#x27; Movement (AZASM) for high school learners and the Azanian Students&#x27; Convention (AZASCO) for university level students. The organisation&#x27;s women&#x27;s wing is Imbeleko Women&#x27;s Organisation, simply known as IMBELEKO.
Its inspiration is drawn from the Black Consciousness Movement inspired philosophy of Black Consciousness developed by Steve Biko, Harry Nengwekhulu, Abram Onkgopotse Tiro, Vuyelwa Mashalaba and others, as well as Marxist Scientific Socialism.

==History==
AZAPO was formed out of the prominent black consciousness organisations namely, Black People&#x27;s Convention (BPC), the South African Students&#x27; Organisation (SASO) and the Black Community Programmes (BCP). These were three of the 17 black consciousness organisations that were banned on Wednesday, 19 October 1977 for their role in the 16 June 1976 Soweto uprisings. A year after the formation of AZAPO, in September 1979, at its conference in Roodepoort, the national executive was elected with Curtis Nkondo as its president. During 1987, AZAPO was banned by the South African government and forced underground and into exile. It would be unbanned in 1990. In October 1994, AZAPO merged with its sister organisation in exile, the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania (BCMA).

AZAPO campaigned for the isolation of South Africa during its apartheid years by waging a &quot;cultural boycott&quot; in the country; black people increasingly regained their resolve to fight for their freedom and formed trade unions and civic organisations.

The armed wing of AZAPO was the Azanian National Liberation Army (AZANLA) which received support and military training from Iran, Yugoslavia, China, Libya, Botswana, Palestine, Syria, North Korea, Cuba, Zimbabwe and Eritrea. AZANLA is a successor to the Azanian People&#x27;s Liberation Front (APLF) whose cadres received military training from countries such as Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. There was an agreement with Iraq to train AZANLA combatants but that was thwarted by the First Gulf War in 1990. During the 1980s, it was engaged in a bloody internecine feud with the ANC which operated under the guise of the United Democratic Front (UDF).

AZAPO, along with its youth wing AZAYO were unbanned in 1990, which permitted it to continue its political programs legally. It was invited, but refused to participate in, the negotiations to end apartheid, a decision which led to the resignation of two senior members, Monwabisi Vuza and Imraan Moosa. The party then boycotted the 1994 elections, but has participated in each of the elections since then. AZAPO won one seat in each of the 1999, 2004 and 2009 elections, but failed to win a seat in the 2014 general election.

The current leader (National President) of the party is Nelvis Qekema who was elected at the 25th National Congress held at University of Johannesburg, Soweto on December 4, 2021. He succeeded Strike Thokoane who was elected as president of AZAPO in 2017, during the party&#x27;s 23rd National Congress in Meadowlands, Soweto.

In February 2022, AZAPO and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) announced a new unity pact with the intention to contest elections together.

==Negotiations with SOPA==
The party has had regular negotiations with SOPA aimed at merging the two parties, but these broke down in 2004, 2007 and again in 2013.

<text>Sinas is a small lunar impact crater that lies in the eastern part of the Moon on the Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 12 km. It was named after the Greek magnate Simon Sinas. This is an isolated formation that is located very near the midpoint of the lunar mare. Sinas is circular and bowl-shaped, with a small floor at the midpoint. A wrinkle ridge intersects the east edge of the crater, and several lunar domes lie to the north.

Nearby craters include Jansen and Carrel to the northwest, Aryabhata to the southeast, and Maskelyne to the south.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sinas.

<doc id="1149223" wikidata="Q1028212" url="?curid=1149223" title="Cambrian Railways">
<text>The Cambrian Railways owned of track over a large area of mid Wales. The system was an amalgamation of a number of railways that were incorporated in 1864, 1865 and 1904. The Cambrian connected with two larger railways with connections to the northwest of England via the London and North Western Railway, and the Great Western Railway for connections between London and Wales. The Cambrian Railways amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1922 as a result of the Railways Act 1921. The name is continued today in the route known as the Cambrian Line.

== History ==
=== Creation of the Cambrian Railways: 1864 ===
The Cambrian Railways Company was created on 25 July 1864 when the (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. cclxii) received royal assent. The company was formed by amalgamating most of the railway companies in mid Wales: the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway and the Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway. The shareholders of these constituent companies became the shareholders in the new Cambrian Railways Company. The was not included in the amalgamation because it was still under construction. In all, the new company had lines totalling in length.

As well as incorporating existing railways, the new company had agreements to share traffic with the Mid-Wales Railway, the Manchester and Milford Railway and the Great Western Railway. This allowed it to control the transportation of goods and passengers across mid Wales.

=== Early years: 1864–1869 ===

==The Cambrian Railways system==
===Constituent railways===
The earliest section of the Cambrian was the section from Three Cocks to Talyllyn Junction. This had been opened in 1816 as part of the Hay Railway, a tramroad worked by horses connecting the town of Hay-on-Wye with the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal at Brecon. The western section was sold to the Brecon and Merthyr Railway; the eastern section became part of the Mid-Wales Railway.

In the following list the dates are: date of incorporation; opening date

* Oswestry and Newtown Railway : 6 June 1855; 1860–61
* Llanidloes and Newtown Railway : 4 August 1853; 1859. Until 1861 this section of the line was isolated
* Newtown and Machynlleth Railway : 27 July 1857; 1863
* Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway : 1 August 1861; 1863–1864
* : 26 July 1861; 1863–1869
* Mid-Wales Railway : 1 August 1859; 1 September 1864. This railway was independent of the Cambrian until 1 January 1888, when the latter took over working the line. On 1 July 1904 the two railways amalgamated.
* Wrexham and Ellesmere Railway ; opened in 1895. Wrexham was the largest town served by the Cambrian.
* Van Railway (serving lead mines) : built 1871
* Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway : gauge: opened 4 April 1903; closed to all traffic on 5 November 1956: reopened as a heritage railway 6 April 1963.
* Tanat Valley Light Railway (Llynclys to Llangynog) : opened 5 January 1904: closed to passengers 1951
* Mawddwy Railway : incorporated 5 July 1865: closed to passengers 1931; closed 1951
* Vale of Rheidol Railway : gauge: built 1902, absorbed 1913.

===Branch lines===

* Abermule to Kerry
* Barmouth Junction to Dolgellau
* Llanymynech to Llanfyllin Branch 
(The information in this section was taken largely from &quot;The Railway Year Book 1912&quot;.)

==Feeder lines==
The Cambrian had connections with many independent lines, including:

===Narrow gauge===

* Corris Railway, at Machynlleth
* Hendre-Ddu Tramway, at Aberangell
* Festiniog Railway, at Minffordd
* Kerry Tramway, at Kerry
* Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway, at Llanfihangel (later Llandre)
* Talyllyn Railway, at Tywyn

===Standard gauge===

* Potteries, Shrewsbury &amp; North Wales Railway (later Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway), at Llanymynech
* Manchester &amp; Milford Railway (later part of the GWR) at Aberystwyth
* Mawddwy Railway at Cemmes Road railway station
* Van Railway at Caersws

==Railway operations==

The headquarters of the Cambrian Railways was at Oswestry railway station in Shropshire. The building still stands today, although detached from modern network main railway lines, and was in use for commercial purposes until 2004. After restoration in 2005, this building was reopened as the Cambrian Visitor Centre in June 2006; but on 11 January 2008 closed due to the terms of the lease not being settled. It has since reopened and, amongst other things, is being used as the headquarters for the newly formed Cambrian Heritage Railways (CHR) restoration project. 

The largest station premises on the line were at (part of which has been restored and reopened as a J D Wetherspoon in the mid-2000s).

On vesting its headquarters in July 1865 in Oswestry, the company built the Cambrian railways works to the north of the station on Gobowen Road. Its construction hastened Oswestry&#x27;s boom as a railway town, from a population of 5,500 in 1861, to nearly 10,000 in 1901.

Built of local red brick and costing £28,000, the locomotive erecting shop had a central traverser which was hand-operated, serving 12 roads on each side. On the far north end of the works, 11 sidings accessed a carriage and wagon works. Power to the machines was provided by a large steam engine via overhead shafting and belts. The chimney is still a local landmark. Whilst many carriages and wagons were built in the workshops, only two locomotives were actually constructed at Oswestry, though many were rebuilt there. After the Cambrian Railways was taken over by the GWR on grouping in 1923, the GWR kept the works open as a regional carriage and wagon works, and locomotive repair shop for the associated locomotive shed.

In 1911 there were 91 locomotives and one rail motor car in the Cambrian&#x27;s rolling stock. At grouping in 1922, 94 standard-gauge engines and five narrow-gauge engines were transferred to the GWR, identified by type and builder at Locomotives of the Great Western Railway.

After becoming part of the London Midland Region in 1963, the depot closed in January 1965, the works in early 1966. A Grade II listed building, the works today is an antiques centre, small business hub and document storage centre.

== Accidents ==

*On 1 January 1883, a passenger train was struck by a landslide at Friog, Merionethshire. The locomotive and its tender were pushed into the sea. Both crew were killed.
*On 11 June 1897, a passenger train was derailed at Welshampton, Shropshire due to a combination of defective track and excessive speed. Twelve people were killed. 
*On 17 January 1918, two freight trains were in a head-on collision at Parkhall, Shropshire due to irregular operation of tablet instruments by signalmen at Oswestry North and Ellesmere Junction signal boxes. The design of the circuitry connecting the instruments and the weather were contributory factors.
*A head-on collision occurred at Abermule on 26 January 1921, killing 15 passengers, including Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest, chairman of the company and son of the fifth Marquess of Londonderry. The accident was caused by a confusion amongst the staff at Abermule whereby the driver of the train in the station was given back the token he had just handed over, for the section of track he had just travelled over – it would not have been possible to give him the token for the next section. The driver did not check which token he had and set off. He soon collided with the Aberystwyth to Manchester express coming the other way, which had the token for that section.

==Legacy today==
A registered museum dedicated to the history of the Cambrian Railways is run by Cambrian Heritage Railways in Oswestry.

A selection of original Cambrian Railways coaches have survived into the present day. Coaches 4, 251 and an unidentified saloon/brake car all stand in private residence. No. 9 is in private storage. No. 110 is being restored to service on the Swindon and Cricklade Railway. No. 238 and an unidentified six-wheel brake resides with the National Museums &amp; Galleries of Wales. No. 247 is currently being used as the café at Chinnor station on the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway and No. 250 as a museum on the neighbouring Cholsey and Wallingford Railway having formerly been the Wallingford station café. Both No. 247 and No. 250 are grounded bodies. An unidentified first class passenger body also stands on the Tanat Valley Light Railway. A full brake car, No. 104, was recovered in August 2018 and currently resides on the Swindon and Cricklade Railway awaiting restoration.

No Cambrian standard-gauge locomotives still exist.

A road in Brecon which runs off the B4601 and over a part of the former line is known as Cambrian Way in commemoration of it.

<doc id="1149230" wikidata="Q1848848" url="?curid=1149230" title="McDiarmid Park">
<text>McDiarmid Park is a stadium in Perth, Scotland, used mainly for association football. It has been the home ground of Scottish Premiership side St Johnstone since its opening in 1989. The stadium has an all-seated capacity of .

As well as St Johnstone matches, McDiarmid Park has been chosen to host the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup on nine occasions. It has also been used for rugby union, including a full international between Scotland and Japan in 2004, several Scotland A fixtures, and some home matches of the former Caledonia Reds team.

==History==
St Johnstone had played at Muirton Park since 1924, but it had fallen into disrepair by the 1980s. St Johnstone was then a Second Division club and did not have the funds to repair it. In December 1986 the club received the news that Asda wanted to purchase Muirton Park and the adjoining ice rink to build a supermarket on the site. In return, the club would be relocated, at no cost to them, to a brand-new stadium at the western edge of the city. A local farmer, Bruce McDiarmid, donated 16 acres of land at his Newton of Huntingtower Farm, on which the stadium now stands. The going rate for the land at that time would have been approximately £400,000 but Bruce McDiarmid saw a donation of his &quot;berry and barley fields&quot; as a gift to the people of Perth. At the insistence of St Johnstone he accepted a 20 per cent shareholding and the title of honorary president of the football club. The Taylor Report noted that there had been a happy &quot;confluence of factors&quot; that allowed St Johnstone to make this development. McDiarmid died in 1999, aged 88.

The stadium was designed by Percy Johnson-Marshall and built by Miller Construction. The stadium was a prototype and based on legislative advice that was soon to become out of date, but a good facility was built for a reasonable cost. Work started on the Tulloch farmland donated by Bruce McDiarmid in December 1988 and was finished in time for the start of the 1989–90 season. Although McDiarmid Park was opened after the Hillsborough disaster, all of the planning and most of the construction work had been done beforehand. Lord Justice Taylor visited the ground as part of his inquiry into the disaster.

The first match at McDiarmid Park was played on 19 August 1989, a 2–1 victory for Saints in a First Division match against Clydebank. This league fixture on the opening day of the season was deliberately kept low-key as a glamour challenge match had been arranged for the official opening. On 17 October 1989, St Johnstone lined up against English club Manchester United, who brought a full strength side to Scotland. The Manchester United team, managed by former St Johnstone player Alex Ferguson, included Jim Leighton, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Bryan Robson, Paul Ince, Brian McClair, Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe. McClair scored the only goal of the game, in front of a near capacity (9,780) crowd. The legendary Sir Matt Busby and Bobby Charlton were also in attendance. With just 30 minutes played of the match, the stadium was temporarily plunged into darkness caused by a fault at an electricity substation. Although the stadium&#x27;s emergency generators were able to provide lighting in the stands, it was 23 minutes before play was resumed.

St Johnstone enjoyed great success when the stadium first opened. The club won promotion to the Premier Division in their first season at McDiarmid. In the first season back in the top flight, the average attendance at McDiarmid was 6,000, approximately three times what it had been at Muirton. These high attendances led the club to create space for another 600 seats, raising the capacity to over 10,700. A record home attendance of 10,721 was set by a home game against Rangers on 26 February 1991. McDiarmid Park also hosted matches of the Scotland under-21 team and the Scotland women&#x27;s national team. By the mid-1990s, however, attendances had drifted down to below 4,000, although this was still nearly double what they had been at Muirton.

In 2011, plans to demolish the 2,000 capacity North Stand were publicised. This would have allowed a commuter link road from the neighbouring A9 road to be built. St Johnstone chairman Geoff Brown justified the proposal on the grounds that comparable clubs, such as Inverness and St Mirren, have since built grounds with smaller capacities. The proposals were rejected by Perth and Kinross Council.

==Structure and facilities==
McDiarmid Park, the first purpose-built all-seater stadium in the United Kingdom, consists of four covered, single-tier stands. Facilities include parking for 1,000 cars and 100 coaches, a synthetic playing surface adjacent to the ground (which is used as the team&#x27;s training ground), and conference facilities within the Main (West) Stand. The stands are all of a similar height, with the Main Stand, on the western side of the ground, being slightly taller. The Main Stand also has greater leg room between rows of seats and includes an area with padded seats reserved for season-ticket holders, club officials and their guests. In the north-east corner of the ground there is an electronic scoreboard. The floodlights at McDiarmid are the same ones used at Muirton Park. The club also tried to retain the square goalposts used at Muirton, but the timber frames could not be re-erected.

The South Stand is named the Ormond Stand, after Willie Ormond, a successful manager of St Johnstone who left the club in 1973 to manage Scotland. The Ormond Stand also houses the club&#x27;s souvenir shop, which is only open on match days before and after the match. It was formerly nominated as a &quot;family stand&quot;, for home fans and fans of the visiting club to sit together. The club has a number of options for housing visiting fans. Visiting supports of a few hundred or less are housed in a segregated section at the north end of the main stand, with the two end stands closed. Clubs who regularly bring a larger support are also allocated the North Stand. If a very large visiting support is expected the club has a further option to also open the Ormond Stand for away fans.

Being a prototype stadium, McDiarmid Park has some faults that critics of seated stadia picked upon. Spectators in the front rows of the stands are not necessarily sheltered, while the stadium has been criticised for lacking atmosphere. St Johnstone are routinely praised for their pricing structure especially for visiting families sitting in the Ormond/Family stand.

==Other uses==
===Scottish League Challenge Cup Final===
The final of the Challenge Cup is often held at McDiarmid Park because of its capacity and the fair distance it is in relation to most teams who have contested the cup in the SPFL. McDiarmid Park isn&#x27;t the sole host as finals have also been played at Fir Park (Motherwell), Broadwood Stadium (Cumbernauld), Excelsior Stadium (Airdrie) Easter Road Stadium (Edinburgh), Caledonian Stadium (Inverness), and Almondvale Stadium (Livingston).

===Rugby Union===
Professional rugby union side Caledonia Reds played some of their home games at McDiarmid Park before they were merged with the Glasgow Warriors in 1998. The merged Warriors initially played some of their 1999 games in Perth, but eventually switched all home games to Glasgow.

On 13 November 2004 the Scotland national rugby union team played Japan there in a historic first test match north of the River Forth. The result was a 100–8 scoreline in favour of Scotland, the first time the Scottish rugby team had scored a century. Chris Paterson scored 40 points (three tries, 11 conversions and one penalty).

The stadium has hosted several of Scotland&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; team: a victory over Italy in 1999, a draw over Argentina in 1999, a win against Samoa in 2000, and a loss to Italy in 2003. On 21 November 2006, Scotland &quot;A&quot; faced Australia in Perth, their first appearance on home soil in three years. On 23 February 2007, Scotland &quot;A&quot; hosted Italy at McDiarmid Park.

===Non-sporting usage===
For many years the stadium hosted the Scottish convention of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, which brought thousands of worshippers to the local area every summer. In July 2009, a mass baptism was held, which included the use of a pool. Over 8,000 people attended the three-day event. The 2012 convention was their last year at the stadium as the religious organisation opted to use The SSE Hydro arena at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow for their national convention.

On 6 July 2008, Elton John became the first musician to play at the stadium.

<text>Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio (; born 3 October 1978) is a Peruvian former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is currently serving as club ambassador for Bayern Munich. He was captain of Peru&#x27;s national football team, being its fifth highest scorer. He is the highest scorer and most successful Latin American football player in the history of German football. He is the all-time top scorer of SV Werder Bremen, the ninth top scorer in the history of Bayern Munich and the sixth top scorer in the history of the Bundesliga and its second top scorer in the 21st century. He is also among the 20 top scorers in the history of UEFA club competitions and is the seventh highest South American scorer in European football history.

His professional debut came in 1996, with Deportivo Pesquero. In 1998, he joined Alianza Lima, where he won a Peruvian Primera División, being highlighted as the best player of the season. In 1999, he was signed by Werder Bremen from the Bundesliga. Just one year later, he was chosen as the newcomer player of the championship and was included in the ideal team of the 2000–01 season. In 2001, he signed for Bayern Munich and the following seasons he won one Intercontinental Cup, 2 Bundesligas, 4 DFB-Pokale (German Cups), 2 DFL-Ligapokale (German League Cups) and the DFL-Supercup (German Super Cup). In addition, he was the top scorer in the DFB-Pokal in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 editions.

In 2007, he signed for Chelsea F.C. scoring on his debut and achieving runner-up in the Premier League at the end of the season. In 2009, he returned to Bremen, where he was champion of the 2008–09 DFB-Pokal and the unofficial 2009 German Supercup, in addition to becoming top scorer in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. In 2012, he was hired again by Bayern Munich, winning the UEFA Champions League, the Club World Cup, the European Super Cup, the DFL-Supercup, three Bundesligas and two DFB-Pokale, thus becoming the foreign player with most titles in the history of Bayern Munich, a total of 18. In mid-2015, he returned to Werder Bremen. In 2017, he was hired by the 1. FC Köln, from which he separated a year later to return to Werder Bremen.

Pizarro is the Peruvian football player with the most goals scored and games played in Europe and in German football. He is the second highest foreign scorer and sixth all-time historic scorer in the Bundesliga (197 goals). He is also the Latin American football player with the most goals scored and titles won in the history of German football. He is the ninth all-time top scorer for the DFB-Pokal (34 goals), top scorer for Werder Bremen (153 goals), the ninth all-time top scorer for Bayern Munich (125 goals), the tenth historical scorer of the UEFA Europa League (24 goals) and the fifth historical scorer of Peru&#x27;s national football team (20 goals). He is also the foreign player with the most games played in the history of Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal. Pizarro is considered an idol by Bayern Munich&#x27;s fans and a legend of Werder Bremen&#x27;s, teams for which he scored more than 100 goals each. As well as being one of the players with the most seasons played in the history of the German league, Pizarro is also the oldest player to score a goal in the Bundesliga (at over 40 years old).

In international competitions, he is the fourth highest Latin American scorer in European Cups (Champions League, UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League) with 48 goals, ranking only behind Lionel Messi, Alfredo Di Stéfano and Sergio Agüero. With the Peru national football team he is the fifth highest scorer with 20 goals and the tenth with the most matches (85). With the senior team, he achieved the third place at the 2015 Copa América. He also participated in the 2004 and 2007 Copa América.

==Early years==
Pizarro was born to Patricia Bosio and Claudio Pizarro Dávila, a naval officer, in Callao, Peru and raised in Santiago de Surco district of Lima, Peru. He started playing in his youth in the Academia Deportiva Cantolao in Callao. Pizarro has Italian ancestry; some of his paternal great-grandparents were from Brescia, while his maternal grandparents came from Frattaminore, near Naples.

==Club career==

===Deportivo Pesquero===
Pizarro started his professional career playing with Deportivo Pesquero, a small provincial team in the city of Chimbote in the north of Peru, at the age of 17. His first professional match was in 1996 against Alianza Lima. He scored his first two goals two weeks later against Atletico Torino in the 2–1 victory of Deportivo Pesquero. He finished the 1996 season with three goals in 16 appearances.

===Alianza Lima===
Pizarro scored 25 goals over two seasons with Alianza Lima and was part of the team that ended in second position in the Torneo Apertura of Peru in 1999. He also made seven appearances in Copa Libertadores. Shortly after his success at Alianza, Pizarro was sold to Werder Bremen in the German Bundesliga. Later that year, he earned his first call for the Peru national football team.

===Werder Bremen===
Pizarro joined Werder Bremen for the first time in the summer of 1999 when he was only 20 years old. His first match in the Bundesliga was on 28 August of that year, a 1–1 draw against Hertha BSC, joining as a second-half substitute. In his second appearance on 12 September, Pizarro scored his first Bundesliga goal in the 5–0 victory over 1. FC Kaiserslautern at home. One week later, Pizarro made his first hat-trick in the 7–2 victory over VfL Wolfsburg, establishing himself as one of the most promising talents. He ended his first Bundesliga season scoring 10 goals in 25 matches. In that season, Pizarro also made his UEFA Cup debut, scoring 3 times in 9 appearances. In his first ever match on 15 September, he scored 2 goals in the 5–0 home win over Norway&#x27;s FK Bodø/Glimt. He was protagonist in the third round tie against French rival Olympique Lyonnais. After losing the first leg away 3–0, Pizarro helped Werder Bremen on one of the best comebacks in UEFA competitions history. In the returning leg, he scored the fourth goal of a 4–0 win at Weserstadion. The result allowed Werder Bremen to move to the next round with a 4–3 on the aggregate.

Pizarro&#x27;s 38 goals over 2 seasons for Werder Bremen made him the rising star of Peruvian football, coveted by managers of major European teams. After the 2000–01 season, Werder Bremen announced that it would not prevent Pizarro from moving out as the push to secure Pizarro&#x27;s services intensified. The media indicated that Real Madrid and Barcelona, Inter Milan, and Werder Bremen&#x27;s Bundesliga rival Borussia Dortmund were in to sign Pizarro. The most speculated transfer of a Peruvian footballer monopolized the interest of its local media. After seeming destined for Spain, Pizarro ended weeks of speculation by signing for Bayern Munich on 7 June 2001.

===Bayern Munich===
Pizarro started at Bayern with a goal in the fourth minute of the game against Schalke 04 in the second match of the 2001–02 Bundesliga season. In his first season, he scored 15 goals in 30 Bundesliga and 4 German Cup appearances, 4 goals in 14 appearances in the UEFA Champions League, one appearance in the Intercontinental Cup, and one appearance in the UEFA Super Cup.

Pizarro was a key player in Bayern&#x27; Munich&#x27;s Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in the 2002–03 season. On 30 November 2002, Pizarro appeared in his 100th Bundesliga match in the 2–0 home win over Hertha BSC, thanks to a Michael Ballack brace. During the 2002–03 season, Pizarro scored 15 goals in 31 appearances in the Bundesliga, 2 goals in 6 DFB-Pokal appearances, 2 goals in 7 Champions League appearances. He also had 2 League Cup appearances.

During the 2003–04 season, he scored 11 goals in 31 Bundesliga appearances and 1 goal in 4 DFB-Pokal appearances. He also had 7 Champions League and 1 League Cup appearances.

During the 2004–05 season, Pizarro scored 21 goals in 35 appearances.

During the 2005–06 season, he scored 11 goals in 26 Bundesliga appearances, 5 goals in 5 German Cup appearances, 1 goal in 6 Champions League appearances, and an appearance in the League Cup.

His popularity with Bayern fans earned him the nickname &quot;Bomber of the Andes&quot;, a reference to his Peruvian origin as well as to the legendary Bayern&#x27;s striker Gerd Müller, nicknamed &quot;Bomber&quot;. On some occasions, he was also called &quot;Inca God&quot; by the media.

Pizarro&#x27;s contract with the German champions expired at the end of the 2006–07 season and negotiations on an extension were not making progress, with Sevilla, Benfica and Rangers ready to step in. Pizarro later rejected a contract extension offered by Bayern Munich&#x27;s director Franz Beckenbauer. Pizarro demanded an increase in pay, which angered Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who was quoted saying that &quot;anyone wishing to earn as much as Shevchenko had better start playing like Shevchenko&quot;.

On 20 May 2007, Bayern Munich announced Pizarro would be leaving the club. He finished the 2006–07 season with 12 goals in 45 appearances.

===Chelsea===

On 1 July 2007, Chelsea officially signed Pizarro and confirmed that he had completed a medical evaluation and agreed on personal terms to join based on a Bosman transfer, signing a four-year contract. He was the first Peruvian to sign for Chelsea. Pizarro also revealed that his decision was influenced by the advice of his national teammate Nolberto Solano, who played in England for Newcastle, Aston Villa and West Ham United, as well as Owen Hargreaves, who at the time played for Bayern Munich with Pizarro.

Pizarro was assigned the number 14, the same number he has in the Peruvian National Team, and his former number at Bayern Munich, succeeding Geremi at Chelsea. His debut was against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Community Shield, coming on as a substitute, but then missed the penalty shootout as Chelsea lost the match. Nevertheless, his season with Chelsea got off to a good start, scoring a goal on the opening weekend of the 2007–08 Premier League season against Birmingham City. After Chelsea&#x27;s coach José Mourinho&#x27;s departure and the signing of French striker Nicolas Anelka, Pizarro found himself surplus to the then new manager Avram Grant. Despite this, Pizarro did play an important role in Chelsea progressing to the fourth round of the 2008 FA Cup, by contributing to a rebound of QPR keeper Lee Camp that went into the net. He also scored the only goal in a match against Birmingham. This meant that his only two Premier League goals with Chelsea came in separate games against Birmingham City.

====Werder Bremen (loan)====

On 15 August 2008, Pizarro was loaned to Werder Bremen until the end of the season. Soon after the announcement, a large group of Werder Bremen fans lined up to buy the new Pizarro&#x27;s jersey showing that he was still appreciated in Bremen seven years after leaving. He was assigned the number 24 and scored his first goal in his second appearance, Werder Bremen&#x27;s first goal in a 3–2 defeat to Borussia Mönchengladbach on 30 August . Pizarro scored Werder Bremen&#x27;s fourth goal in the club&#x27;s impressive 5–2 away victory over Bayern Munich on 20 September at the Allianz Arena. Former Werder Bremen&#x27;s teammate Tim Borowski scored both of Bayern Munich&#x27;s goals.

On 26 February 2009, Pizarro scored a second-half brace for Werder Bremen, coming back from 2–0 down to secure a 2–2 draw and a 3–3 aggregate win (away goals rule), to dump A.C. Milan out of the UEFA Cup in the Round of 32. In the second-leg of their UEFA Cup quarter-final match against Udinese on 17 April, Pizarro scored once and teammate Diego notched a brace as the teams played out an exciting 3–3 draw, with Werder Bremen advancing to the semi-finals with a 6–4 aggregate victory. He scored a hat-trick on 4 May as Bremen beat Hannover 4–1, keeping alive their push for a European place.

Pizarro&#x27;s role was fundamental in the qualification of Werder Bremen to the UEFA Cup Final, scoring a goal in the 3–2 away victory over Hamburg on 7 May, completing a 3–3 aggregate victory over their German rivals in the semi-finals. However, with the absence of playmaker Diego in the final against Shakhtar Donetsk, Pizarro could not save the team from a 2–1 defeat after extra time to the Ukrainian champions on 20 May 2009 at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul.

Pizarro was decisive and important for Werder Bremen during his return, scoring 17 goals in just 26 Bundesliga appearances in the 2008–09 season.

===Third stint at Werder Bremen===
On 18 August 2009, Pizarro signed permanently his return to Werder Bremen for an undisclosed amount after an impressing performance in the previous season. In his second season with Werder Bremen, he continued to be one of the top Bundesliga scorers with 16 goals. On 23 October 2010, Pizarro scored his 134th goal in the Bundesliga, making him the top foreign-born scorer in the league&#x27;s history, after being tied with Giovane Élber. Pizarro finished the 2010–11 season with 14 goals in 29 appearances. On 15 May 2012, Pizarro announced that he would leave Werder Bremen in the summer. He finished his final season with 18 goals in 29 appearances.

===Return to Bayern Munich===

On 26 May 2012, Pizarro signed a one-year contract with his former German team, Bayern Munich. On 31 October, Pizarro scored 2 goals against Kaiserslautern in the DFB-Pokal. In the Champions League match against Lille on 7 November, Pizarro scored a hat-trick within the first 33 minutes of the game as Bayern defeated their French opponents 6–1. On 30 March 2013, Pizarro scored 4 goals, his firsts in the Bundesliga season, and provided two assists in a 9–2 win of Bayern Munich against Hamburg. On 10 April 2013, Pizarro came off the bench to score a 90th-minute goal against Juventus in the quarter-final of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, which would end in a 0–2 win for Bayern Munich (0–4 in the aggregate). Pizarro scored twice more and provided a further two assists in Bayern Munich&#x27;s 6–1 victory over Hannover 96 on 20 April. He finished the 2012–13 season with 13 goals in 28 appearances.

On 19 April 2014, Pizarro scored in Bayern Munich&#x27;s 2–0 win over Eintracht Braunschweig, making him a scorer to every single Bundesliga team. During the 2013–14 season, he scored 10 goals in 17 Bundesliga appearances, 1 goal in 2 German Cup appearances. He also had 6 Champions League appearances, a German Super Cup appearance, and a FIFA World Club Cup appearance.

His contract wasn&#x27;t renewed after the 2014–15 season, when he scored just one goal in 17 appearances. He failed to score in any of his Bundesliga or Champions League matches during the rest of the season.

===Fourth stint at Werder Bremen===
On 7 September 2015, Pizarro joined Werder Bremen for the fourth time in his career, agreeing to a one-year contract. He was given the number 14. On 2 March 2016 Pizarro reached 10 goals in the season by scoring a hat-trick in the 4–1 win away to Bayer Leverkusen. The then 37-year old Pizarro broke a record which stood for 31 years, becoming the oldest player to score a hat-trick in the Bundesliga. He finished the 2015–16 season with 14 league goals, and was ranked by kicker as one of the top strikers in the Bundesliga. On 2 July 2017, Werder Bremen announced Pizarro&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. He finished the 2016–17 season with one goal in 19 appearances.

===1. FC Köln===
On 29 September 2017, Pizarro signed a one-year contract with 1. FC Köln. They were relegated from the Bundesliga following defeat to SC Freiburg on 28 April 2018. He finished the 2017–18 season with a goal in 16 appearances.

===Fifth stint at Werder Bremen===

On 29 July 2018, Pizarro signed a one-year contract with Werder Bremen joining them for the fifth time in his career.

On 16 February 2019, with his stoppage equaliser in the away match against Hertha BSC, Pizarro became the oldest scorer in the history of the Bundesliga at 40 years and 136 days of age. Pizarro broke the record previously held since August 1996 by Miroslav Votava ( then 40 years and 121 days of age). His goal also made him the first and only player to score in 21 consecutive calendar years in the Bundesliga. On 4 May 2019, he scored his fourth Bundesliga goal of the season, in a 2–2 equalizer of Werder Bremen against Borussia Dortmund. His fifth goal determined the 2–1 win against RB Leipzig, raising the record for the oldest scorer to 40 years 227 days of age.

On 20 July 2019, Pizarro announced that the 2019–20 season would be his last season before retiring from football activity. In that season, he played 18 Bundesliga matches without scoring a goal. In all of these, he entered as substitute, including his final appearance against Mainz 05 on 27 June 2020. He was no longer considered in the team for the following 2 relegation playoff games. In his career at the Bundesliga, Pizarro scored 197 goals in 490 matches.

==International career==

Pizarro has been a regular for Peru since scoring in a 2–1 defeat against Ecuador on his debut in February 1999. In the same year, he was part of the Peruvian team at the 1999 Copa América in Paraguay, starting all three of the group matches and coming on as a substitute in the quarter-final match, which ended with a penalty shootout loss against Mexico. Pizarro has gone on to be a starting player at the 2004, 2007 and 2015 Copa América tournaments, as well as the FIFA World Cup qualifying campaigns for the 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018.

On 23 August 2003, Pizarro scored the fastest ever goal in the history of the Peruvian national team, at 18 seconds of the match&#x27;s start for a 3–1 win over Mexico at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. He was later shown a red card along with teammate John Galliquio and Mexicans Jared Borgetti and Omar Briceño.

At the 2004 Copa América, Pizarro suffered a fractured skull when he took an elbow to the side of his head in an on-field collision with the opponent&#x27;s goalkeeper during a 3–1 win over Venezuela. The injury forced him out of the rest of the tournament and required extensive surgery in Germany. Under the management of Julio César Uribe, Pizarro captained Peru to the quarter-finals of the 2007 Copa América, scoring the two goals in the 2–2 draw against Bolivia in the final match of the group in Mérida.

On 18 June 2015, Pizarro scored the only goal of Peru&#x27;s 1–0 win against Venezuela in the group stage of the 2015 Copa América. He won his last cap in March 2016.

===Suspension and investigation===
On 7 December 2007, an investigation was launched on women and alcohol found in the national squad&#x27;s concentration hotel, two days before Peru&#x27;s away 5–1 defeat by Ecuador. Pizarro was suspended 18 months from the national team starting on the day before the match. Other Peruvian players playing abroad, like Jefferson Farfán were also suspended. Since Pizarro claimed to be innocent, he started a trial against the Peruvian Football Federation. This action alerted FIFA about his case, who warned Pizarro not to take it to regular courts of justice or face an international sanction. On 3 July 2008, after an investigation and a review of the facts, the suspension was reduced to 3 months (from the date of appeal in April 2008) and a US$10,000 fine. Pizarro served the three-month sanction.

On 17 April 2009, Pizarro won a court victory over his national federation. The Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned the $10,000 fine imposed by the Peruvian Football Association after the alleged November 2007 incident. The sentence quoted: &quot;The facts put forward by (the federation) in relation to Pizarro were not supported by concrete evidence&quot;, sport&#x27;s highest court said in a statement. Pizarro expressed his rejoice with the final result, declaring: &quot;I am very satisfied and feel vindicated&quot;. He further said. &quot;My honor has been restored. My family and friends have always stood by me and knew that these were all just lies that were being spread about me. But this verdict will now also give certainty to everyone who had doubts that I have always told the truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn/si&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pizarro has a sister, Patricia, and a younger brother, Diego. Diego is also a professional footballer and played for Bayern Munich as a youth.

Pizarro is married to his teenage sweetheart, Karla Salcedo, having two sons and a daughter. All three were born in Germany. Pizarro co-owns a race horse called &#x27;Crying Lightning&#x27; with fellow professional footballer Joey Barton. In January 2011, the horse competed at the Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai.

On 15 September 2020, Pizarro became an ambassador for Bayern Munich.

<text>The fount of honour () is a person, who, by virtue of their official position, has the exclusive right of conferring legitimate titles of nobility and orders of chivalry on other persons.

== Origin ==

During the High Middle Ages, European knights were essentially armoured, mounted warriors. In feudalism, by virtue of its defining characteristic of subinfeudation, it was common practice for knights commander to confer knighthoods upon their finest soldiers, who in turn had the right to confer knighthood on others upon attaining command. For most of the Middle Ages, it was possible for private individuals to form orders of chivalry. The oldest existing order of chivalry, the Order of Saint John of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, was formed as a private organization which later received official sanction from church and state.

The 13th century witnessed the trend of monarchs, beginning with Emperor Frederick II (as King of Sicily) in 1231, retaining the right of &quot;fons honorum&quot; as a royal prerogative, gradually abrogating the right of knights to elevate their esquires to knighthood. After the end of feudalism and the rise of the nation-state, orders and knighthoods, along with titles of nobility (in the case of monarchies), became the domain of the monarchs (heads of state) to reward their loyal subjects (citizens) – in other words, the heads of state became their nations&#x27; &quot;fountains of honour&quot;.

Many of the old-style military knights resented what they considered to be a royal on their independence. The British social anthropologist, Julian A. Pitt-Rivers, noted that &quot;while the sovereign is the &#x27;fount of honour&#x27; in one sense, he is also the enemy of honour in another, since he claims to arbitrate in regard to it.&quot; By the early thirteenth century, when an unknown author composed &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal&quot;, (a verse biography of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, often regarded as the greatest medieval English knight) Richard W. Kaeuper notes that &quot;the author bemoans the fact that, in his day, the spirit of chivalry has been imprisoned; the life of the knight errant, he charges, has been reduced to that of the litigant in courts.&quot;

==Legality of honours today==
The question whether an order is a legitimate chivalric order or a self-styled order coincides with the subject of the &quot;fons honorum&quot;. A legitimate fount of honour is a person or entity who holds sovereignty when the order is awarded. Ultimately, it is the authority of the state, whether exercised by a reigning monarch or the president of a republic, that distinguishes orders of chivalry from private organizations. In Canada, for example, other persons – whether commoners, knights or nobles – no longer have the right to confer titles of nobility, knighthoods or orders of chivalry on others.

The official website of the British monarchy states: &quot;As the &#x27;fountain of honour&#x27; in the United Kingdom, The [Monarch] has the sole right of conferring all titles of honour, including life peerages, knighthoods and gallantry awards.&quot; Some private societies in the United Kingdom (such as the Royal Humane Society) have permission from the monarch to award medals which may be worn by those in uniform provided the private society&#x27;s medal is worn on the right-side rather than the usual left. In Spain the fount of honour is King Felipe VI as the head of state.

In France, only decorations recognised by the Grand Chancery of the Legion of Honour may be worn publicly, and permission must be sought and granted to wear any foreign awards or decorations. Dynastic orders are prohibited unless the dynasty in question is currently recognised as sovereign. (For example, the Royal Victorian Order is explicitly recognised, whereas the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus is not.) Failure to comply is punishable by law. A non-exhaustive list of collectively authorised orders is published by the government.

The President of the Portuguese Republic has inherited the duties of fount of honour from the Portuguese monarchs, since, unlike titles of nobility, the Portuguese orders of chivalry were not extinguished with the Republican Revolution in 1910. The current Constitution of Portugal alternatively styles the President as the &quot;Grand Master of the Portuguese Honorific Orders&quot; (); in this capacity, the President can wear as a private insignia the Sash of the Three Orders, which has become a symbol of the Portuguese presidential magistracy.

The Papal Orders of Knighthood comprise five orders awarded directly by the Holy See and two others which it &#x27;recognises and supports&#x27;: the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In response to queries regarding the Catholic Church&#x27;s relationship to a large number of self-proclaimed Roman Catholic chivalric orders, the Holy See issued a statement in 2012 stating that any body other than its own seven approved orders, &#x27;whether of recent origin or mediaeval foundation, are not recognised by the Holy See&#x27; and that &#x27;the Holy See does not guarantee their historical or juridical legitimacy, their ends or organisational structures... to prevent the continuation of abuses which may result in harm to people of good faith, the Holy See confirms that it attributes absolutely no value whatsoever to certificates of membership or insignia issued by these groups, and it considers inappropriate the use of churches or chapels for their so-called &quot;ceremonies of investiture&quot;.&#x27;

<text>Curlew River – A Parable for Church Performance (Op. 71) is an English music drama, with music by Benjamin Britten to a libretto by William Plomer. The first of Britten&#x27;s three &#x27;Parables for Church Performance&#x27;, the work is based on the Japanese &quot;noh&quot; play &quot;Sumidagawa&quot; (Sumida River) by Kanze Jūrō (1395–1431), which Britten saw during a visit to Japan and the Far East in early 1956. Beyond the &quot;noh&quot; source dramatic material, Britten incorporated elements of &quot;noh&quot; treatment of theatrical time into this composition. &quot;Curlew River&quot; marked a departure in style for the remainder of the composer&#x27;s creative life, paving the way for such works as &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot;, &quot;Death in Venice&quot; and the Third String Quartet.

Plomer translated the setting of the original into a Christian parable, set in early medieval times near the fictional Curlew River, in the fenlands of East Anglia. Peter F. Alexander has investigated in detail the librettist&#x27;s contribution to the work, through study of the letters between Plomer and Britten. Mikiko Ishi has done a comparative study of the &#x27;weeping mother&#x27; figures in &quot;Sumidagawa&quot;, &quot;Curlew River&quot;, and various religious plays from medieval Europe. Daniel Albright has examined Britten&#x27;s and Plomer&#x27;s adaptations of aspects of the &quot;Sumidagawa&quot; original into the context of their own cultural and religious backgrounds in the creation of &quot;Curlew River&quot;.

Under Colin Graham&#x27;s direction, the work was premiered on 13 June 1964 at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Orford, Suffolk, England, by the English Opera Group. The original cast included Britten regulars Peter Pears and Bryan Drake. The United States premiere was presented at the Caramoor Summer Music Festival on 26 June 1966, with Andrea Velis as the Madwoman.

== Synopsis ==
:[The story is told through four main characters who, in the style of Noh theatre, are all performed by male singers: the Abbot (who acts as a narrator), and the Madwoman, the Ferryman, and the Traveller, performed by monks. A chorus is provided by eight Pilgrims]

&quot;Curlew River&quot; opens, as do the other two Church Parables, with a processional, to the hymn &quot;Te lucis ante terminum&quot; (&quot;To Thee before the close of day&quot;), in which all performers, including the musicians, walk to the performance area and take their places. At a cue from the organ, the Abbot, who acts as a narrator, introduces the &quot;mystery&quot; to be presented. The monks who depict the principal players don their costumes to stately instrumental accompaniment after which the play commences.

The Ferryman sings of a memorial service that will be held that day at a shrine across the river. A Traveller approaches, wishing to cross the Curlew River. The Ferryman delays his departure when they hear the Madwoman approaching. She has gone mad because of grief for her son, who disappeared a year ago. Though the Ferryman is initially reluctant to carry the Madwoman, the other characters take pity on her and persuade him to give her passage. As they cross the river, the Ferryman tells the story of the shrine: it is the burial place of a boy who arrived the year before with a cruel master who had kidnapped him from his home near the Black Mountains. The boy was sick, and his master abandoned him by the river. Despite being cared for by the locals, the boy died. The Ferryman recounts the boy&#x27;s words:

: &quot;I know I am dying... Please bury me here, by the path to this chapel. Then, if travellers from my dear country pass this way, their shadows will fall on my grave, and plant a yew tree in memory of me.&quot;

The river people believe that the boy&#x27;s grave is sacred, that:

: &quot;...some special grace is there, to heal the sick in body and in soul&quot;

As the Ferryman tells his story, it becomes clear that the boy he describes is the child of the Madwoman. Grief-stricken, she joins the rest of the cast in praying at the boy&#x27;s graveside. At the climactic moment when all the men are chanting together, the voice of the boy (a treble) is heard echoing them, and his spirit appears above the tomb to reassure his mother:

: &quot;Go your way in peace, mother. The dead shall rise again, And in that blessed day, We shall meet in heav&#x27;n&quot;

At this point, the Madwoman is redeemed and her madness lifts. Britten depicts the moment with the Madwoman letting out a joyful, melismatic &quot;Amen&quot;, the final note of which resolves onto a long-delayed unison with the full cast – a signal of return and acceptance.

Here the robing ceremony music returns, as at the start, and the players resume their normal dress. The Abbot reiterates the moral, and bids the audience farewell. The full cast then recess to the same plainsong with which the work began.

== Music ==
At the premiere performance the instrumentalists included flutist Richard Adeney, horn player Neill Sanders, violist Cecil Aronowitz, double bass player Stuart Knussen, harpist Osian Ellis, organist Philip Ledger and percussionist James Blades.

The singers are accompanied by a small group of instrumentalists, dressed as lay brothers. The work is scored for:

* Flute (doubling piccolo)
* Horn
* Viola
* Double Bass
* Harp
* Percussion (5 small untuned drums, 5 small bells, 1 large tuned gong)
* Chamber Organ

Unusually, there is no conductor in the work—instead, the instrumental performers lead among themselves; the places at which each instrument is to lead are marked in the score. The lack of a conductor allows Britten to dispense with a universal tempo, the performers often instead playing in two or more separate groups at separate tempi, comparable to the sound of the music of a Nobayashi ensemble in Noh plays. This leads to another unusual notational device, the &#x27;Curlew sign&#x27;, which is used to &#x27;resynchronise&#x27; previously separate groups of musicians by instructing one to sustain or repeat notes &#x27;ad lib&#x27; until a given point has been reached in the music of another group. The harp part is heavily influenced by music for the koto and the chamber organ part features extensive use of tone clusters, which are derived from the &quot;shō&quot;, an ancient Japanese free-reed mouth organ used in &quot;gagaku&quot; court music. (Britten had become acquainted with this instrument while in Japan for two weeks in February 1956.)

Britten&#x27;s chief compositional technique in &quot;Curlew River&quot; is heterophony, which he uses to extraordinary dramatic effect. It permeates all aspects of the work&#x27;s composition, with textures derived from short, decorative couplings, or long, unsynchronised layers of melody. The opening plainsong (&#x27;Te lucis ante terminum&#x27;) suggests many of the melodic shapes throughout the Parable.

As in many of Britten&#x27;s other dramatic works, individual instruments are used to symbolise particular characters. In &quot;Curlew River&quot;, the flute and horn are used most clearly for this purpose, symbolising the Madwoman and Ferryman respectively. With such a small orchestra, Britten does not use the &#x27;sound worlds&#x27; that are clearly demonstrated in his &quot;War Requiem&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, nor the dramatic change in orchestral timbre (with the entry of the celesta and vibraphone, respectively) that accompanies the appearances of Quint in &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; or Tadzio in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;.

==Recordings==

<doc id="1149243" wikidata="Q3108318" url="?curid=1149243" title="Glacier Point">
<text>Glacier Point is a viewpoint above Yosemite Valley in the U.S. state of California. It is located on the south wall of Yosemite Valley at an elevation of , above Curry Village. The point offers a superb view of several of Yosemite National Park&#x27;s well-known landmarks, including Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Falls, Half Dome, Vernal Fall, Nevada Fall, and Clouds Rest. Between 1872 and 1968, it was the site of the Yosemite Firefall.

==Geology==
The extreme point of the promontory of Glacier Point is wholly bare, but on the slopes below, in the hollow to the west, and on the wooded slope above, glacial material is abundant. Its glacial origin is definitely proved by the presence in it of rocks derived from Little Yosemite Valley and the Sierra Nevada.

There are three types of glacially-deposited rock at Glacier Point:
#Most plentiful are rounded boulders and cobbles and angular fragments, all deeply weathered, of Half Dome quartz monzonite, the light-colored granite of which not only Half Dome, but all of the Little Yosemite and its surrounding heights are composed.
#There are also a few boulders of a coarse-grained, highly siliceous granite, light buff in general tone when fresh but vivid rose when weathered. There is only one place in the High Sierra above the Yosemite from which they can be derived: Mount Clark, the sharp-profiled peak which stands on the east side of the Illilouette Basin, from Glacier Point.
#Finally, there are fragments of yellowish quartzite and gray schist whose places of origin have been located on the long northern spur of Mount Clark.

Native Americans reportedly used Glacier Point&#x27;s overhanging rock as a lookout, calling it &quot;Patill-ima,&quot; though its meaning is unknown.

==History==

In the late 1800s, the first formal trail to Glacier Point was constructed. This steep, rugged path became known as the Four Mile Trail, which was completed in 1872, allowing visitors to hike to the summit for sweeping views of Yosemite Valley.

In 1882, the Yosemite Stage and Turnpike Company was granted permission to build a stage road to the summit, offering a less strenuous, though longer, route for horse-drawn vehicles.

By the early 1900s, the road was improved for automobiles, allowing easier access for visitors with a direct, drivable route to the point. The federal government took control of the road in 1917, the same year the Glacier Point Hotel opened.

==Access==
Glacier Point can be reached from the Valley via Glacier Point Road. During the summer, Glacier Point is often crowded with tourists. Tours by bus are also available and take about four hours. The road is usually open from June through October. In winter, Glacier Point Road closes due to snow, and access to Glacier Point from the Badger Pass Ski Area is only by ski or snowshoe.

Glacier Point can also be reached via the Four Mile Trail, which ascends the in . This moderate to strenuous trail can provide access to Glacier Point when the Glacier Point Road is closed. Note, however, that the trail can be extremely hazardous when covered with snow or ice, so it is usually closed by the Park Service from December through May. Another trail runs from Glacier Point down to the Valley, via the Panorama Trail, past Nevada and Vernal Falls.

Hikers may also access trailheads to the Panorama trail and the Pohono trail.

In 2020, the National Park Service announced major road works on Glacier Point Road in 2022. Due to this work, Glacier Point Road will be closed for the entire season in 2022. Glacier Point will only be accessible by foot during this year. There will also be road works in 2023, but only delays are predicted for this work.

<doc id="1149245" wikidata="Q133555" url="?curid=1149245" title="Pingré (crater)">
<text>Pingré is a lunar impact crater that is located near the southwest limb of the Moon, beyond the large crater Phocylides. It lies to the northwest of the huge walled basin Bailly, and to the east of the smaller Graff. Due to its location, this crater appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth.

The outer rim of this crater has become worn due to minor impacts, leaving the features rounded and irregular. The wall is nearly disintegrated in the southeast, and is overlain by a small crater along the eastern rim. The rim is also low and slumped to the northwest. The interior floor is relatively level, but marked by several small craters, which may be secondaries from Hausen or a more distal crater. These craters occur near the midpoint of the floor where a central peak may once have existed.

Pingré lies to the southeast of the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pingré.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Pingré H — &quot;See&quot; Yakovkin.

<doc id="1149252" wikidata="Q160686" url="?curid=1149252" title="Saint Walpurga">
<text>Walpurga or Walburga (; ; ; 71025 February 777 or 779) was an Anglo-Saxon missionary to the Frankish Empire. She was canonized on 1 May c. 870 by Pope Adrian II. Saint Walpurgis Night (or &quot;Sankt Walpurgisnacht&quot;) is the name for the eve of her feast day in the Medieval period, which coincided with May Day; her feast is no longer celebrated on that day, but the name is still used for May Eve.

== Early life ==
Walpurga was born in Dumnonia, roughly corresponding to modern Devon, during the period it was becoming incorporated into Anglo Saxon England. She was the daughter of Richard the Pilgrim, a likely Britonnic underking of the West Saxons, and of Wuna of Wessex, and had two brothers, Willibald and Winibald.

== Religious career ==

In 721 Richard set out on a pilgrimage to Rome with his two sons. Before leaving he entrusted Walburga, then 11 years old, to the abbess of the double monastery at Wimborne Abbey in Dorset. She had been there but a year when she received word that her father had died at Lucca. After seeing to their father&#x27;s burial in the Basilica of San Frediano, her brothers completed the pilgrimage to Rome, where they both became seriously ill. (Hygeburg, who wrote the &quot;Vita S. Willibaldi&quot;, says they contracted the Black Death; Francis Mershman suggests malaria).

After recovering, Winibald, who was not of a particularly strong constitution, remained in Rome to pursue further studies, while Willibald set out for the Holy Land. After about seven years of travelling, Willibald returned to Italy and became a monk at Monte Cassino. In 730, Winibald returned to England and engaged a third brother and several amongst his kindred and acquaintances to accompany him on his journey back to Rome to begin a monastic life there.

During this time Walpurga remained at Wimborne where she was educated, and eventually became a nun. The nuns of Wimborne were skilled at copying and ornamenting manuscripts; and celebrated for Opus Anglicanum, a fine needlework utilising gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen, often decorated with jewels and pearls. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe. She spent 26 years as a member of the community.

In 737, Walpurga&#x27;s uncle (her mother&#x27;s brother), Boniface, was in Rome and recruited his nephews to assist him in his religious work in Germany. Winibald arrived in Thuringia on 30 November 740, and after being ordained a priest, was placed in charge of seven churches. Willibald, upon arriving at Eichstätt, was ordained by Boniface on 22 July 741 and began missionary work in the area.

Walpurga then travelled with her brothers, Willibald and Winibald, to Francia (now Württemberg and Franconia) to assist Boniface in evangelizing the still-pagan Germans. Some sources claimed that she wrote her brother Willibald&#x27;s &quot;vita&quot; and an account in Latin of his travels in Palestine, though these were later determined to have been written by Hugeburc of Heidenheim.

Walpurga became a nun in the double monastery of Heidenheim am Hahnenkamm, which was founded by Willibald. He appointed her as his successor and following his death in 751, Walpurga became the abbess of the monastery. Upon Winibald&#x27;s death in 760 she also succeeded him as superintendent of the Heidenheim monastery.

== Death ==
Walpurga died on 25 February 777 or 779 (the records are unclear) and was buried at Heidenheim; the day carries her name in the Catholic church calendar. In 870, Walpurga&#x27;s remains were translated to Eichstätt. In Finland, Sweden, and Bavaria, her feast day commemorates the transfer of her relics on 1 May.

== Veneration ==

Walpurga&#x27;s feast day is 25 February, but the day of her canonization, 1 May (possibly 870), was also celebrated during the high medieval period, especially in the 11th century under Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, so that Walpurgis Night is the eve of May Day, celebrated in continental folklore with dancing.

At Eichstätt, her bones were placed in a rocky niche, which allegedly began to exude a miraculously therapeutic oil, which drew pilgrims to her shrine. The bituminous oil, called Walpurgis oil, was said to exude from her bones (especially from October through February) and was regarded as being efficacious against disease.

The two earliest miracle narratives of Walpurga are the &quot;Miracula S. Walburgae Manheimensis&quot; by Wolfhard von Herrieden, datable to 895 or 896, and the late 10th-century &quot;Vita secunda&quot; linked with the name of Aselbod, bishop of Utrecht. In the 14th-century &quot;Vita S. Walburgae&quot; by Phillipp von Rathsamhaüsen, bishop of Eichstätt (1306–22), the miracle of the tempest-tossed boat is introduced, which Peter Paul Rubens painted in 1610 for the altarpiece for the church of St. Walpurgis, Antwerp. In addition, the 19th-century Cardinal Newman declared the exuded oil to be a credible miracle.

The earliest representation of Walpurga is in the early 11th-century Hitda Codex, made in Cologne, and depicts her holding stylized stalks of grain. In other depictions, the object has been called a palm branch which is not correct, since Walpurga was not martyred. The grain attribute has been interpreted as an instance of a Christian saint (Walpurga) coming to represent an older pagan concept; in this case, the pagan Grain Mother. Peasant farmers fashioned her replica in a corn dolly at harvest time and told tales to explain Saint Walpurga&#x27;s presence in the grain sheaf.

== Patronage ==
Walpurga is the patroness of Eichstätt and Weilburg, Germany; Oudenarde, Veurne, Antwerp, Belgium; Tiel (demolished), Groningen (demolished), Arnhem, Amby and Zutphen the Netherlands; and she is invoked as special patroness against hydrophobia (rabies), in storms, and also by sailors.

St. Walburga&#x27;s Abbey is located at Eichstätt, Bavaria. A second Benedictine Abbey of St. Walburga is located in Virginia Dale, Colorado, near the Wyoming border. The abbey in Colorado is home to approximately 20 contemplative Catholic nuns and also has a retreat center. St. Walburg Monastery in Covington, Kentucky, is a community of Benedictine sisters who arrived in Northern Kentucky in 1859. Their early teaching efforts later resulted in the establishment and development of Villa Madonna Academy and Thomas More University.

The Church of St. Walburge, a Catholic church in Preston, Lancashire, England, is a church famous for its spire. At , the spire is the tallest of any parish church in England, with only the spires of Salisbury and Norwich Cathedrals reaching higher.

The St. Walburg&#x27;s Hospital, a 220-bed hospital in southern Tanzania was built in 1959.

== St. Walburga Church in Antwerp (Belgium) ==
Central in the first fortified city of Antwerp, from the 11th century, was the church dedicated to Saint Walburga. Under French occupation in 1798, the church was confiscated and sold; it served as a warehouse. In 1816, the Dutch government confiscated the church building, and in 1817, it was demolished. The city mayor and aldermen decided to erect a statue of Pieter Paul Rubens on the burg square left after the demolition. In 1880, when the Scheldt quais were built, most of the area of the first fortified city from the 11th century was demolished and even the foundations of the St. Walburga Church disappeared, and the statue was moved to the Groenplaats.

Some parts of the interior of that ancient church, which actively served for more than 700 years, were recovered: the altarpiece painting &quot;The Elevation of the Cross&quot; and the predella (foot of the altar) have been reused in the main altar of the Cathedral of Our Lady. Another altar was moved to the in Tilburg where it serves as the main altar.

In 1936, the city master builder (architect) constructed a new modernistic church building with the same name on the Volkstraat near . This building was declared a monument in 1995 and was restored in 2007.

<text>Virginia Oglesby Zanuck (; Fox; April 19 (year of birth disputed) – was an American actress who starred in many silent films of the 1910s and 1920s.

==Life and career==

Fox was born as Virginia Oglesby Fox in Wheeling, West Virginia (though her grave erroneously lists Charleston, West Virginia, as her place of birth), the daughter of Mary Elizabeth (née Oglesby) and Frederick Fox. 

While on vacation from boarding school, Fox traveled to visit a friend in Los Angeles. The two made a casual stop by the studio of Mack Sennett, where she was hired on the spot and made a bathing beauty in the studio&#x27;s films. She went on to star as leading lady in many of the early films of Buster Keaton, including 1920&#x27;s highly regarded &quot;Neighbors&quot;. 

On January 12, 1924, she married film producer Darryl F. Zanuck, with whom she had three children, Darrylin, Susan Marie, and Richard Darryl. Fox retired from acting but was known as a behind-the-scenes influence on her husband&#x27;s business decisions. The couple separated in 1956 over the studio mogul&#x27;s affairs with other women, although they never legally divorced. According to Zanuck biographers, she cared for him at their home from the time he became mentally incapacitated in the early 1970s until his death in 1979.

Despite some Internet accounts to the contrary, Virginia Fox was not related to William Fox, whose name is preserved in the 20th Century Fox film studio, which Darryl Zanuck created and led for decades. William Fox founded Fox Studios but had lost control of it by the time Zanuck acquired it and merged it into his own empire.

==Death==
On October 14, 1982, Fox died of a lung infection complicated by emphysema at her home in Santa Monica, California after having been sick for about a year. She was buried near Darryl Zanuck at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles.

<doc id="1149261" wikidata="Q2066973" url="?curid=1149261" title="Peek (crater)">
<text>Peek is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the northern part of the Mare Smythii near the eastern limb of the Moon. This part of the lunar surface is subject to the effects of libration, and the crater can be hidden from sight during an unfavorable libration. Even when visible, however, the crater is seen almost edge-on, making it difficult to see much detail from the Earth. Due to foreshortening the crater appears close to Schubert, even though the two are about 60 km apart. It lies to the south-southeast of the large crater Neper.

This crater is generally circular and bowl-shaped, with a small interior floor at the center of the sloping inner walls. The crater has a higher albedo than the surrounding dark lunar mare, making it appear slightly brighter than the nearby terrain. The crater has not been significantly eroded by subsequent impacts.

<text>Prodnalog (, from продовольственный налог, prodovolstvenniynalog; &quot;food tax&quot;; , from ) is the Russian word for a tax on food production, paid in kind in the Soviet Union, and sometimes known as &quot;the tax in kind&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Prodnalog&quot;, which replaced &quot;prodrazvyorstka&quot;, was introduced by a Decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on March 21, 1921 and was abolished in 1924.

The transition to prodnalog was the first act of the New Economic Policy and a necessary incentive for increasing Soviet agricultural production . The peasants knew in advance how much produce they would have to surrender to the state. The rate of prodnalog was much smaller than prodrazvyorstka. For comparison, in 1920-1921 the peasants surrendered to the state 367 million &quot;poods&quot; (6,010,000 metric tons) of cereals through prodrazvyorstka, as opposed to 240 million poods (3,930,000 metric tons) in 1921-1922 through prodnalog.

During the first year of introduction of prodnalog, a significant amount of bread and other products remained at peasant households&#x27; disposal, which provided an incentive for peasants to develop their own household economy, widen the sowing areas, increase the total number of livestock and productivity of crops. The rate of prodnalog on each kind of agricultural product was determined depending on local conditions and prosperity of a given peasant household. The Soviet state adhered to a policy of progressive taxation; the highest rate of prodnalog had to be paid by the kulak households.

In March and April 1921, a number of Soviet Decrees introduced a natural tax on bread, potato, oilseeds, eggs, dairy products, wool, hides, flax and hemp linen, tobacco etc. The collection of agricultural goods in excess of prodnalog, if necessary, was intended to be made on a barter basis by giving peasants manufactured goods. In order to accelerate the expansion of commodity circulation, create necessary conditions for developing farming and industry and speed up the productive forces of the country, the government encouraged small-scale production all over Soviet Union. The introduction of prodnalog revived the trade and created a different kind of relations between the city and the village. 
By the decision of the 12th Congress of the RCP(b) (April 1923), prodnalog and other taxes in the rural areas were exchanged for a universal direct agricultural tax (decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and Sovnarkom on May 10, 1923). The latter would be collected in monetary form starting in 1924, with the establishment of hard currency in the USSR.

<text>Aalesunds Fotballklubb, commonly known as Aalesund or AaFK, is a Norwegian football club from the town of Ålesund, that competes in the Norwegian first division, the second tier of the Norwegian football league system. The club was founded on 25 June 1914. As of 2004, the football club had 835 members and several teams on both professional and amateur levels. These teams are the 1st and 2nd teams, junior team, and also several age-specific teams.

==History==
In 2009 the club won the Norwegian Cup for the first time in its history. They beat rival Molde FK in the Final, and thereby qualified for participation in the UEFA Europa League. Aalesund also won the 2011 Cup final, where they beat SK Brann.

===Recent domestic===

===European===
==Supporters==
The local supporter club for AaFK is called &quot;Stormen&quot;, or &quot;The Storm&quot;, with about 2000 members. They also have another supporter club who is called &quot;Aalesund Support&quot; which makes great noise every game.

===Rivalries===
Rival football clubs in the city include Herd, Rollon, Skarbøvik and Spjelkavik, with Molde and Hødd traditionally being the main regional rivals. Hødd has been less competitive with AaFK in recent years, as they have not been in the same division for some time. More recent rivalries have centred on Molde and Strømsgodset, and to some extent Brann.

The club&#x27;s supporters enjoy a good relationship with supporters of Oslo club Vålerenga, and it is not uncommon for supporters of one club to support the other in competitions where only one team participates. In the 2011 game against Neath in Wales, some supporters of 2010&#x27;s Europa League opponents Motherwell also made their way to support the club.

==Stadium==
Aalesund played their home matches at Kråmyra Stadium until the 2005 season, when they relocated to the new Color Line Stadium with an approximate capacity of 11,000 people. Boosted by the new stadium, recent success and general increasing attendance in Norway, Aalesund has gone from attracting crowds of approximately 1,000 to regularly selling out their stadium in only a few years. Their average attendance of 9,943 in the 2006 1. divisjon became at the time a new record for attendances at the second tier of the Norwegian league system.

<text>Brive-la-Gaillarde (; Limousin dialect of ), commonly known as simply Brive, is a commune of France. It is a sub-prefecture and the largest city of the Corrèze department. It has around 46,000 inhabitants, while the population of the agglomeration was 75,579 in 2019.

Although it is by far the biggest commune in Corrèze, the capital is Tulle. In French popular culture, the town is associated with a song by Georges Brassens.

== History ==
Even though the inhabitants settled around the 1st century, the city only started to grow much later. From around the 5th century onwards, the original city began to develop around a church dedicated to Saint-Martin-l&#x27;Espagnol. During the 12th century walls were built around the city and during the Hundred Years&#x27; War a second wall was built. These fortifications no longer exist and have been replaced by boulevards.

The commune was named &quot;Brive&quot; until 1919, when it was renamed &quot;Brive-la-Gaillarde&quot;. The word &quot;Gaillarde&quot; (still used in current French) probably stands for bravery or strength in the city&#x27;s name, but it can also refer to the city&#x27;s walls. Brive now extends outside of its original boundaries into Malemort and Ussac.

During World War II, Brive-la-Gaillarde was a regional capital of the Resistance, acting as a seat of several clandestine information networks and several of the principal resistance movements, including the &quot;Armée secrète&quot; (or &quot;Secret Army&quot;) and the &quot;Mouvements Unis de la Résistance&quot; (or &quot;United Movements of the Resistance&quot;).

Brive-la-Gaillarde was the first city of Occupied France to liberate itself by its own means, on 15 August 1944. For this, the city received the &quot;Croix de guerre 1939–1945&quot; military decoration.

The medieval centre is mainly a commercial district with retail shops and various cafés. It is also the location of the city hall, the main police station, and the Labenche museum. One notable landmark outside the inner city is the &quot;Pont Cardinal&quot;, a bridge which used to be a crossing point for travelers from Paris to Toulouse.

== Administration ==
The most recent mayors of Brive-la-Gaillarde were:

<text>Clausius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southwest part of the Moon, in the small lunar mare designated Lacus Excellentiae. It is completely enclosed by mare material, although the tiny satellite crater Clausius A lies just to the north. The rim of Clausius is low and sharp, with a slightly oval shape that is longer in the north–south direction. The interior floor has been flooded by basaltic lava, and appears level and featureless with a darker surface that matches the mare surface that surrounds the crater exterior.

It´s named after German physicist and mathematician Rudolf Clausius.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Clausius.

<text>The Allan Water () is a river in central Scotland. Rising in the Ochil Hills, it runs through Strathallan to Dunblane and Bridge of Allan before joining the River Forth. It is liable to cause floods in lower Bridge of Allan.

It shares its name with a tributary of the River Teviot. The name is similar to the Ale Water in Berwickshire, the River Alness in Ross-shire, the Allander Water in Stirlingshire, the River Alne and the Ayle Burn in Northumberland, the River Ellen in Cumbria, and several names in the south of England, Wales and Cornwall. Ptolemy, who wrote his Geography about 150 AD, gave the names of some of these rivers as Alauna or Alaunos. Ekwall says that Alauna or Alaunos are British [i.e. Brythonic or P-Celtic] river names. Nicolaisen says that the name Allan is of Pre-Celtic Indo-European origin. Its original form was Alauna, from the Indo-European root *el-/ol-, meaning &quot;to flow, to stream&quot;. Several European rivers and settlements have names that may come from that root. Others say that Alauna was a Celtic river goddess, also found in Brittany; Alaunus was a Gaulish god of medicine and prophesy.

Two broadside ballads refer to the &quot;Allan Water&quot;. According to one, a Scottish ballad, the &quot;Allan Water&#x27;s wide and deep, and my dear Anny&#x27;s very bonny; Wides the Straith that lyes above&#x27;t, if&#x27;t were mine I&#x27;de give it all for Anny.&quot; The other, more familiar, English ballad begins &quot;On the banks of Allan Water&quot; and relates the death of a miller&#x27;s daughter whose soldier lover proves untrue. This version, popularised by C. E. Horn in his comic opera, &quot;Rich and Poor&quot; (1812), is sung by Bathsheba Everdene at the sheepshearing supper in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Far From The Madding Crowd&quot; (1874). A similar rendition was recorded with church organ accompaniment by Italian singer Ariella Uliano in 2008.

==Industry==
The river and its tributaries were once extensively used to power mills and factories. The major tributaries, the Muckle Burn and River Knaik, are mainly in hilly sheep farming terrain and no significant industrial use was made of them.

The Danny Burn tributary of the Allan, the Wauk Mill N890081 appears to have been a small corn mill belonging to a local farm. Very little remains. (Pan around the same external link to find the other locations.)

Progressing downstream, the mill buildings and weir at Kinbuck NN790051 still exist but are derelict. The weir NN785040 and some large mill buildings NN783038 at Ashfield still exist but are largely derelict.

There are two substantial weirs in Dunblane, at NN770017, feeding the Springbank Mill NN770016, which still exists but is no longer a mill, and at NN780014.

Downstream of Dunblane, a weir at NS785996 fed the long derelict Lower Keir Mill at NS785994.

At Bridge of Allan there are still in existence three very substantial weirs, the upper of which, NS786981, formerly supplied the Airthrey Mills NS786968, while the middle (NS786977) weir was positioned to collect the outfall from the Airthrey Mills as well as the main flow of the river. The lower weir is at NS788976, and the middle and lower weirs supplied a changing assortment of mills and factories as recently as the 1950s. The area is now occupied by housing but many traces of the mill lades can still be seen, and the flow of water over the weirs remains impressive.

<text>Aixam-Mega () is a French automobile manufacturer based in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie. It was founded in 1983 to make microcars following the acquisition of Arola. On 11 April 2013, US based Polaris Industries announced that it had acquired Aixam-Mega from previous owners Axa Private Equity.

==History==

The company can trace its history back to the establishment of Arola in 1975, which was acquired by Aixam in 1983 out of administration. In 1984 Aixam launched the new 325D, followed by the 400D in 1985.

In 1992, they started making a range of standard sized cars under the Mega brand, but by 2002 this brand was just being applied to a diesel and electric range of microvans and light utility vehicles.

The company currently produces the Aixam A.7&quot;xx series&quot; (where xx is a two-digit number), a microcar comparable with the Smart Fortwo, and powered by diesel engines from Kubota). A notable difference is that some of the smaller models are restricted to and can therefore be driven without a driving licence in some European countries (including Belgium, Estonia, Germany, France, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, and Slovenia).

In Britain, they are classified as a category L7e quadricycle (quad bike) because of their weight and power output. This requires a category B1 licence to legally drive them. In January 2013, the law changed such that special restricted low power versions of the car (Aixam 400) can now be driven by full AM licence holders in the UK.

In 2006, Mega launched the electric &quot;Mega City&quot; at the British International Motor Show and in 2009 acquired the assets of NICE Car Company, which had gone into administration in 2008.

In April 2013, Aixam was acquired by the American group Polaris Industries. 

In September 2024, the new factory in Andancette was inaugurated, the third of the group, resulting from an investment of 30 million euros.

==Aixam mechanics==
The Aixam 400, 500 and 500.5 are very basic vehicles mechanically by today&#x27;s standards. There were a variety of engines offered over the years. The diesel is fitted with a Kubota Z402 two-cylinder 400 cc industrial engine rated at . The petrol versions used a Lombardini 505 cc twin-cylinder of approx , later petrol cars were fitted with fuel-injection.

Steering is by rack and pinion and has a comparatively low ratio. MacPherson strut suspension is used at the front and semi-trailing arms at the rear. Brakes are by disc and single-piston calipers at the front, with drums at the rear also serving for handbrake function, via cables.

Transmission is by a continuously-variable transmission (CVT) made and supplied by CVTech-IBC. The reversing gearbox and combined differential unit of 8:1 forward ratio, is supplied by the Italian company COMEX, which also supplies many of the other running-gear, steering, suspension and braking system components. The gearbox is designed for small town runabout or delivery van of less than and limited to .

<doc id="1149290" wikidata="Q3557342" url="?curid=1149290" title="Victor Goldbloom">
<text>Victor Charles Goldbloom (July 31, 1923 – February 15, 2016) was a Canadian pediatrician, lecturer, and politician.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Montreal, the son of pediatrician Alton Goldbloom and Annie Ballon. He studied at Selwyn House School and Lower Canada College. He studied at McGill University receiving his BSc in 1944, his MD in 1945, his DipEd in 1950 and his DLitt in 1992. Dr. Goldbloom was assistant resident at the Babies&#x27; Hospital of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, in New York.

==Career==
He was a professor of pediatrics and of medicine at McGill University from 1950 to 1970. He was elected in 1966 as the MNA for the Montreal riding of D&#x27;Arcy-McGee. He was re-elected in 1970, 1973, and 1976. While Robert Bourassa was Premier of Quebec, Goldbloom was Minister of State responsible for Quality of Environment (1970–73). In 1973, he was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs as well as Quebec&#x27;s first Minister of the Environment, serving in both positions until the Liberal government&#x27;s defeat in 1976. Goldbloom was in charge of the Olympic Installations Board for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

He was the first member of the Jewish community to become a cabinet minister in the Quebec government. He kept his seat in the 1976 provincial election that defeated the Liberal government and sat on the Opposition benches until he resigned his seat on October 16, 1979 after Claude Ryan became Liberal leader.

Subsequently, from 1980 to 1987, he was CEO of the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews.

From 1991 until 1999, he was Canada&#x27;s fourth Commissioner of Official Languages. During his tenure, Commissioner Goldbloom conducted two comprehensive studies. The first study examined the availability of services in both official languages in offices designated bilingual, which concluded that the federal government&#x27;s bilingualism was not yet fully implemented nor functional. The second study focused on the implementation of Part VII of the Official Languages Act by the federal government and suggested different ways that Section 41 of the Official Languages Act could be implemented. In this report, Goldbloom suggested assigning a role of Coordinator of Language Policy at the Privy Council Office.

In 2009, he expressed concerns on the state of Catholic-Jewish relations after the lifting of the excommunications of the bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X. Goldbloom died of a heart attack at Montreal in February 2016.

==Family==
In June 1948, he married Sheila Barshay (1925-2022) of Montreal, a social worker who was later named to the Order of Canada. Their sons are Michael Goldbloom, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Bishop&#x27;s University and former publisher of the Toronto Star and the Montreal Gazette, and Jonathan Goldbloom, founder and president of Jonathan Goldbloom &amp; Associates. Their daughter, Susan Restler, lives in Brooklyn, New York.

His brother Richard Goldbloom was also a pediatrician, who worked in Halifax, Nova Scotia at
Dalhousie University and at the Izaak Walton Killam Hospital for Children.

==Honours==
* Officer of the Order of Canada (1983), was promoted to Companion in 2000.
* Officer of the National Order of Quebec. (1991)
* Honorary Doctorate from the University of Ottawa.(1994)

<text>The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis; ; Jyutping: daai6 zaap6 haai5; Shanghainese: &quot;du6-zaq8-ha5&quot;,  &quot;big sluice crab&quot;), also known as the Shanghai hairy crab (,  &quot;Shànghǎi máoxiè&quot;), is a medium-sized burrowing crab that is named for its furry claws, which resemble mittens. It is native to rivers, estuaries and other coastal habitats of East Asia from Korea in the north to Fujian, China in the south. It has also been introduced to Europe and North America, where it is considered an invasive species. The species features on the list of invasive alien species of Union concern. This means that the import of the species and trade in the species is forbidden in the whole of the European Union.

==Description and ecology==
This species&#x27; distinguishing features are the dense patches of dark setae on its claws. The crab&#x27;s body is the size of a human palm. The legs are about twice as long as the carapace.

Chinese mitten crabs spend most of their life in fresh water and return to the sea to breed. The crabs have a lifespan around one to five years, depending on their location. Aquaculture farms in China report time to maturity between one and three years, while invasive crabs in colder European climates may take between four or five years. Once the age of maturity is reached, the crustaceans migrate downstream and attain sexual maturity in the tidal estuaries. After mating, the females continue seaward, overwintering in deeper waters. They return to brackish water in the spring to hatch their eggs. After development as larvae, the juvenile crabs gradually move upstream into fresh water, thus completing the life cycle.

It moves from freshwater habitats to saltwater habitats once it has reached reproduction maturity. The types of estuaries suitable for the mitten crab include large brackish waters for the larva to develop in, and large shallow waters for the growth of the juvenile crabs. An increase in microplastics has had a significant impact on the population as it affects their metabolism, growth, and oxidative stress response in the liver.

The Chinese mitten crab originates from Hong Kong to the border of Korea. It can be found inland but prefers coastal areas. In the Yangtze, the largest river in its native range, Chinese mitten crabs have been recorded up to upstream. It is known to settle in rice fields by the sea and rivers inland. The crab is found in subtropical and temperate regions.

Phylogenetically the crab belongs to the Varunidae family which is the newest group of brachyuran crustaceans. Spawning crabs average around in length. Since crabs spawn at the end of their life spans and perish at the end of the breeding cycle, the crabs can live up to 7 (in Germany also 8) years old.

The mitten crab diet is omnivorous. Their main prey consists of worms, mussels, snails, dead organic material, and other small crustaceans and fish.

===Reproduction===
Mitten crabs are catadromous organisms, migrating from freshwater to saltwater for breeding. In late August, sexual instincts awaken and they begin migrating downstream to the sea, away from their feeding grounds. It is during this migration where the crabs reach puberty and develop their sex organs. The crabs begin to breed in the brackish waters in late fall. The males arrive first and stay in the brackish waters all winter; the females arrive after. The eggs are laid within 24 hours of mating, then attached to the abdomen of the female. After the eggs are attached, the female leaves immediately, heading to the mouth of the river. The larvae hatch from the eggs during the summer, after which they float and drift about the brackish waters. Because the journey to breed for crabs is so great, they only breed once during their lifetimes. The breeding age is normally toward the end of their lifespans. The crabs have sizable egg production count since these crabs only breed once. After the crabs successfully reproduce, they have very little energy and begin to waste away.

Different life stages of the mitten crab:

# Eggs require pure salt water to mature.
# Larvae hatch from the eggs in brackish waters.
# The larvae gradually move from brackish water to fresh water.
# The final stage of the larvae is the megalopa, which is in length.
# The megalopa then develop into small mitten crabs in the freshwater.

===Invasiveness===
This certain species of crab has been spreading rapidly from Asia (China and Korea) to North America and Europe, raising concerns that it competes with local species, and its burrowing nature damages embankments and clogs drainage systems. The crabs can make significant inland migrations. It was reported in 1995 that residents of Greenwich saw Chinese mitten crabs coming out of the River Thames, and in 2014 one was found in the Clyde, in Scotland. The crabs have also been known to take up residence in swimming pools. In some places, the crabs have been found hundreds of miles from the sea. There is concern in areas with a substantial native crab fishery, such as the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and the Hudson River in New York (both locations where the crabs were first spotted in 2005), as the impact of the invasion by this species on the native population is unknown.

It is generally illegal to import, transport, or possess live Chinese mitten crabs in the United States, as accidental release or escape risks spreading these crabs to uninfested waters. In addition, some states may have their own restrictions on possession of mitten crabs. California allows fishing for mitten crabs with some restrictions.

The Chinese mitten crab has been introduced into the Great Lakes several times but has not yet been able to establish a permanent population.

The Smithsonian is tracking the spread of the Chinese mitten crab and seeking help to determine the current distribution status of the mitten crab in the Chesapeake Bay region. People are encouraged to report any mitten crab sightings, along with details (date, specific location, size) and a close-up photograph or specimen if possible. The first confirmed record along the East coast of the United States was in the Chesapeake Bay near Baltimore, Maryland, in 2005.

Chinese mitten crabs have also invaded German waters, where they destroy fishing nets, hurt native fish species and damage local dams, causing damage of up to 80 million Euros. These crabs migrated from China to Europe as early as 1900 and were first documented by official German reports in 1912 from Aller River. After an investigation by German scientists in 1933, it was thought that the crabs migrated to Europe through ballast water in commercial ships. The crabs are the only freshwater crab species in Germany, and their tendency to dig holes has caused damage to industrial infrastructure and dams.

The first time the crab was brought to Europe was most likely by commercial vessels. Ships must fill their ballast water tanks and during one of these filling events, it could have been the spawning time for the mitten crab. Since the larvae are free floating and in size, it would have been easy for them to be swept into the ballast water tank. Once the ship reached Europe and emptied its tank, the crab larvae were released. Over time, this repetition would allow for a prominent mitten crab population in Europe. The crab has spread and can be found in Continental Europe, Southern France, United States of America (the San Francisco Bay), and the United Kingdom. A 15-year period in Germany when the crabs were gradually entering Europe is known as the &quot;establishment phase&quot;.

==Culinary==

Crabs are an autumnal delicacy in Shanghai cuisine and eastern China. It is prized for the female crab roe, which ripen in the ninth lunar month and the males in the tenth. The crab meat is believed by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to have a &quot;cooling&quot; (yin) effect on the body.

Crabs from Yangcheng Lake are especially prized, since they are perceived to have sweeter meat. Most of the Yangcheng crabs are exported to Shanghai and Hong Kong, and high-profit foreign markets. Responding to the spread of the crab to the West, businessmen have started seeing it as a new source of crab for the Chinese market. One proposed scheme involves importing unwanted crabs from Europe, where they are seen as a pest, to replenish local pure-bred stock.

Mitten crabs have exhibited a remarkable ability to survive in highly modified aquatic habitats, including polluted waters. Like some fish, they can also easily tolerate and uptake heavy metals, such as cadmium and mercury. Therefore, the farming and post-harvesting of the species needs proper management if it is used as a food. Concerns have been raised that the population and origin of the crab may be affected because of overfishing of the species in the Yangtze.

In 2010, a Chinese businessman introduced vending machines to sell this species of crab in the subways. The crabs are stored at , which induces a sleep-like state.

=== Counterfeit Yangcheng Lake crabs ===
Counterfeit crabs are a problem in the hairy crab industry. Due to the high demand for hairy crabs specifically from Yangcheng Lake, many vendors sell hairy crabs from other lakes and claim they are authentic Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs. Although only 3,000 tons of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs were harvested in 2012, more than 100,000 tons of supposed &quot;Yangcheng&quot; crabs were sold.

&quot;Bathing crabs&quot; are hairy crabs sourced from elsewhere which are temporarily placed in Yangcheng Lake and then fraudulently sold as genuine Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs.

Identifying counterfeit crabs is a hard task, as the Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs look exactly like other hairy crabs. Technology has been implemented to identify fake hairy crabs, such as laser tags, prints, and barcodes, but these are easily forged. Blockchain-based tracing has also been implemented, where caught crabs are entered into a blockchain. Efforts to combat bathing crabs are ongoing.

==Management efforts==
Management efforts have been shown to be very difficult. This is due to its abundance, high reproductive rate, and high physiological tolerance. All the following efforts were attempted but showed little improvement: &quot;catch as many as you can&quot;, migration barriers, trapping, raising awareness, electrical screens, and pulses.

There has been a discussion of capturing the breeding crabs at the river mouths. There have been difficulties in carrying out this plan though. Other strategies such as capturing them when they pile up at dams have proven somewhat effective. The problem arises when the crabs climb the walls of the dams and over into the rivers behind the dams.

<doc id="1149297" wikidata="Q2508091" url="?curid=1149297" title="Peace of Étaples">
<text>The Peace of Étaples was signed on 3 November 1492 in Étaples between Charles VIII of France and Henry VII of England. Charles agreed to end his support for the Yorkist Pretender Perkin Warbeck, in return for being recognised as ruler of the Duchy of Brittany.

The agreement ended an English invasion of France that was launched in response to French support for the Yorkist Pretender and Flemish native Perkin Warbeck. An English army of 26,000 landed at Calais in October and besieged Boulogne. Signed on 2 November, Charles VIII of France agreed to end support for Warbeck and pay an indemnity of £159,000, while Henry VII of England accepted French rights to the Duchy of Brittany. The agreement was ratified in December.

Henry presented the treaty as a demonstration of English strength, in which he forced Charles to sue for peace, and the expulsion of Warbeck from France removed a key enemy. His abandonment of the Bretons was a reversal of the 1489 Treaty of Redon, but in reality, Brittany had already recognised French suzerainty through the marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles in December 1491.

In July 1498, Louis XII renewed the treaty prior to his invasion of Italy in 1499.

In 1510, the councillors of Henry VIII renewed the treaty and sought a continuation of peace.

<text>(; &quot;French Alliance&quot;) or AF is an international organization that aims to promote the French language and francophone culture around the world. Created in Paris on 21 July 1883 under the name &quot;Alliance française pour la propagation de la langue nationale dans les colonies et à l&#x27;étranger&quot; (French alliance for the propagation of the national language in the colonies and abroad), known now simply as &quot;L&#x27;Alliance française&quot;, its primary goal is teaching French as a second language. Headquartered in Paris, the &quot;Alliance&quot; had 850 centers in 137 countries on every inhabited continent in 2014.

==History and role==

The &quot;Alliance&quot; was created in Paris on 21 July 1883 by a group including the scientist Louis Pasteur, the diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, the writers Jules Verne and Ernest Renan, and the publisher Armand Colin. The project was directly linked to the colonial aims of the French Third Republic. France believed it could spread civilization to colonies and promote French imperial grandeur by propagating their language internationally. 

The organization finances most of its activities from the fees it receives from its courses and from rental of its installations. The French government also provides a subsidy covering approximately five percent of its budget (nearly 665,000 € in 2003) 

More than 440,000 students learn French at one of the centres run by the &quot;Alliance&quot;, whose network of schools includes:
* a centre in Paris, Alliance française Paris Île-de-France
* locations throughout France for foreign students and
* 1,016 locations in 135 countries.

The organizations outside Paris are local, independently run franchises. Each has a committee and a president. The &quot;Alliance française&quot; brand is owned by the Paris centre. In many countries, the &quot;Alliance française&quot; of Paris is represented by a &quot;Délégué général&quot;. The French Government also runs 150 separate French Cultural Institutes that exist to promote French language and culture.

The Alliances organize social and cultural events, such as art exhibitions, movie festivals, social gatherings, book clubs.

<doc id="1149303" wikidata="Q705145" url="?curid=1149303" title="Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS">
<text>Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS is a 1975 Canadian nazisploitation film about a sadistic and sexually voracious Nazi prison camp commandant. The film is directed by American filmmaker Don Edmonds and produced by David F. Friedman for Cinépix Film Properties in Montreal. The film stars Dyanne Thorne in the title role, who is loosely based on Ilse Koch, a convicted war criminal and overseer at the Buchenwald concentration camp.

Upon its release in early 1975, the film was immediately met with widespread controversy and critical derision, with Gene Siskel calling it &quot;the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown&quot;. Particular criticism was directed at the film&#x27;s graphic violence, which includes depictions of castration, flagellation, human experimentation, and many other forms of torture. Word of mouth quickly spread, and the film was a considerable financial success, becoming a staple of grindhouse and drive-in theaters.

The popularity of the film led to the creation of three sequels, each of which saw Thorne reprise her role. The film&#x27;s infamy eventually evolved into a considerable cult following, with the character of Ilsa becoming a pop cultural icon ubiquitous with &quot;strong, aggressive&quot; female authority. The film is considered one of the prominent entries of the Nazi exploitation sub-genre, and to a lesser degree the sexploitation sub-genre.

==Plot==
In 1945, Ilsa is commandant of a Nazi concentration camp. She conducts sadistic scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are and should therefore be allowed to fight in the German military. A sadistic authoritarian, Ilsa has a voracious sexual appetite for men, choosing a new male prisoner each night to sleep with. However, owing to her hypersexuality, she is disappointed when her victims inevitably ejaculate and promptly has them castrated and put to death.

After killing her latest victim, Ilsa oversees the arrival of a new batch of male and female prisoners. Though dismissive and dehumanizing of the majority of her wards, she becomes enamoured by the presence of Wolfe, a blond-haired and blue-eyed prisoner who, unlike his compatriots, resembles the Nazi Aryan ideal. Wolfe, a German American student who had been studying in Berlin before the war broke out, tells his cellmate Mario, one of Ilsa&#x27;s former victims, that he has the ability to ejaculate at will, allowing him to have sex with incredible endurance and skill. Wolfe demonstrates this when, called to Ilsa&#x27;s bedroom at night, he manages to bring her to orgasm, becoming her first repeat partner whom she willingly spares.

Having gained Ilsa&#x27;s confidence, Wolfe begins plotting revolt with Mario and a group of female prisoners who have borne the brunt of Ilsa&#x27;s abuse. Meanwhile, Ilsa is made gradually more anxious by news of Allied forces breaking through German defenses. Believing that the enlistment of women into the German military will help stem the tide, Ilsa tries to convince a visiting general of her theories of female supremacy by showing him the various inhumane experiments she has subjected her female prisoners to. The impressed general awards Ilsa the Iron Cross for her efforts, while forcing her to fulfill his nascent urolagnia by giving him a golden shower.

With German forces in retreat, the prisoners revolt, killing most of the camp guards and rounding up the surviving staff. Ilsa is tied to her bed with her stockings by Wolfe during a sex game, before he steals her gun and helps his comrades. Wolfe pleads with the other prisoners to leave the staff to be captured and tried by Allied forces, but they insist that they&#x27;ll escape punishment and summarily execute them. With retreating German forces fast approaching, Wolfe and a lone female prisoner escape into the nearby hills as the remaining prisoners, including Mario, resolve to fight to the death. They are attacked by a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; tank unit, which quickly wipes out the prisoners.

The unit&#x27;s commander disembarks and begins investigating the camp. Upon finding Ilsa tied up, he shoots her in the head before ordering the razing of the camp to destroy evidence of their atrocities. As he brags that the Allies will never know what happened, Wolfe and his fellow escapee watch from atop a nearby hill, the sole survivors of the camp.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
After Lee Frost and David F. Friedman&#x27;s &quot;Love Camp 7&quot; (1969) became successful in Canada, André Link and John Dunning of Cinepix Film Properties sought to capitalize by producing their own Nazi-themed exploitation film. Dunning was inspired by historical records of wartime medical experiments on unwilling human subjects, but also sought to add a female villain.

Dunning worked on the screenplay with writer John C.W. Saxton, drawing inspiration from Ilse Koch, wife of the commandant of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp and, later, Buchenwald. Nicknamed “The Bitch of Buchenwald”, Koch was accused of several war crimes, including an experiment in which she had the skin of tattooed prisoners removed to make furniture. The film&#x27;s central premise of Ilsa torturing women to test their endurance for pain was based on a wartime medical theory that women could take pain and punishment better than men, because they were better equipped as a result of the birthing ordeal.

Link and Dunning approached &quot;Love Camp 7&quot; producer David F. Friedman to produce, an offer he promptly accepted. Friedman was a veteran exploitation filmmaker, having produced numerous “roughie” sexploitation films, as well as Herschell Gordon Lewis’ seminal &quot;Blood Feast&quot;. The director was Don Edmonds, an actor who’d begun directing sexploitation films earlier in the decade. Ilsa would be his third film as director, following &quot;Wild Honey&quot; and &quot;Tender Loving Care&quot;. Edmonds later described the screenplay as &quot;the worst piece of shit I ever read&quot;.

===Casting===
Friedman’s first choice of casting for the lead role was Phyllis Davis. When she proved unviable, he sought out Dyanne Thorne to play the eponymous character. Thorne was a longtime Las Vegas showgirl who had studied under Stella Adler, and who at the time was working as a chauffeur. Thorne referred to the script as “awful”, but took the role after a friend recommended Edmonds personally.

For the role of Dr. Binz, Ilsa&#x27;s diminutive male assistant, Edmonds cast his previous collaborator George Buck Flower, who had also worked with Thorne and Friedman in various capacities as an assistant director, casting director, set decorator, and grip. Flower also served as an uncredited assistant director. Binz&#x27;s appearance is based on that of Magnus Hirschfeld, a pioneering German sexologist (though the real Hirschfeld was fervently anti-Nazi and anti-fascist).

===Filming===
The film was shot in nine days on the Culver City, California, set of the TV series &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. The series had ended in 1971 and the show&#x27;s producers gave permission for the film to be shot there once they learned that the climax of the movie called for the set to be destroyed, thus saving the cost of having it demolished.

Because the film was shot in the United States, it could not legally qualify for the Canadian Film Development Corporation’s &quot;Capital Gains Allowance&quot;. Link and Dunning went uncredited in their capacities as executive producers.

===Post-production===
During editing, David Friedman decided to place a notice before the film&#x27;s opening credits in order to add an air of legitimacy and hopefully tide potential censorship and condemnation as well as accusations of Pro Neo-Nazism. It reads: &quot;The film you are about to see is based on documented Holocaust facts. The atrocities shown were conducted as &#x27;medical experiments&#x27; in special concentration camps throughout Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich. Although the Nazis and Schutzstaffel&#x27;s crimes against humanity are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous, absolutely HORRIFIC crimes will never happen again.&quot;

===Use of pseudonyms===
Several key members of the cast and crew were credited under pseudonyms. David F. Friedman is credited as &quot;Herman Traeger&quot;, screenwriter John C.W. Saxton as &quot;Jonah Royston&quot;, and actors George Buck Flower as &quot;C.D. Lafleuer&quot; and Richard Kennedy as &quot;Wolfgang Roehm&quot;. The credited editor, Kurt Schnit (sounds like German for &quot;short cut&quot;), was likely also a pseudonym, as no such film editor of the time is known to have existed, and he does not hold any other credits of any kind.

== Release ==
&quot;Ilsa&quot; was given a wide release in the United States and Canada in October 1975. It was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in June 1975 and remains unreleased in the country. It was also banned in Australia and Norway. In the United States, the film was released mostly to urban and grindhouse theatres, as was standard practice for many exploitation films of the time.

==Reception==
&quot;Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS&quot; has primarily negative reviews and holds a rating of 36% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews.

&quot;The Independent Film Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of &quot;Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,&quot; a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film zero stars out of four and called it &quot;the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... &quot;Ilsa&quot; plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.&quot; He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to &quot;see it, because I&#x27;m certain they would then remove it.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported walking out on the film and wrote that it &quot;could possibly be the worst soft-core sex-and-violence film of the decade—and the funniest. It&#x27;s set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.&quot;

Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; described the film as &quot;self-conscious Canadian-made camp&quot;, which &quot;wasn&#x27;t notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media&quot;.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the film a scathing review, noting that it &quot;has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is&quot;.

==Accolades==
Ten years after its initial release, &quot;Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS&quot; won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 AVN Awards.

==Legacy==
Despite being critically derided, the film has a cult following, largely due to the lead character&#x27;s endurance and Thorne&#x27;s camp performance. Film scholar Rikke Schubart appraises the character as feminist, writing in &quot;Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970–2006&quot;, &quot;she is not a female hero in any ordinary sense, yet she is a strong, active and aggressive protagonist who has become mythical in Western culture.&quot;

The character is a quintessential pop cultural depiction of sadomasochism and hypersexuality, with Schubert writing that &quot;The uniform, the beautiful and harsh appearance, the fierce pride and the cold cruelty are all features of the dominatrix, who is here, quite literally, a &#x27;castrating bitch.&#x27; She is a hypersexual creature, fully devoted to her job, and always in search of satisfaction.&quot;

==Sequels==
&quot;Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS&quot; was followed by three sequels:
* &quot;Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks&quot; (1976) – the only sequel directed by Don Edmonds. The film is set in an unnamed Middle Eastern kingdom in modern times, with Ilsa as the overseer of a wealthy Sheikh’s harem.
* &quot;Ilsa, the Wicked Warden&quot; (1977) – directed by Jesús Franco. &quot;Wicked Warden&quot; was not originally an official entry in the series, instead being a European film starring Dyanne Thorne as a similar warden character named &#x27;Greta&#x27;. When released in North America, the rights were purchased by the official Ilsa rights holders, who redubbed the film to rename the main character Ilsa and incorporate it as an official entry in the series. It is the only entry in the series to be produced in Europe.
* &quot;Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia&quot; (also 1977) – directed by Jean LaFleur. The fourth and final entry is the only one shot on-location in Canada. It is unique among the series for its &quot;two-act&quot; structure, the first half depicting Ilsa as the commandant of a Siberian gulag in the Soviet Union, while the second half flashes-forward 20 years later to modern-day Montreal, where Ilsa is now the proprietor of a brothel on the run from Soviet authorities. This entry was produced by Ivan Reitman and Roger Corman under the shared alias &quot;Julius Parnell&quot;.

None of these sequels have any story continuity with one another, depicting Ilsa in wildly differing locations and time period and often ending in her death or incapacitation.

==In popular culture==
* In Jörg Buttgereit&#x27;s 1989 horror film &quot;Der Todesking&quot;, a character rents a Nazisploitation movie called &quot;Vera – Todesengel der Gestapo&quot; (Vera, the Death-Angel of the Gestapo), which depicts a concentration camp prisoner being castrated by an Ilsa-like prison guard.
* The 2007 film &quot;Grindhouse&quot; features a faux-trailer for a film called &quot;Werewolf Women of the S.S.&quot; by Rob Zombie, whose characters have been referred to as resembling Ilsa. The lead female officer, Eva Krupp (played by Zombie&#x27;s wife, Sheri Moon), can also be seen as an Ilsa-like character.
* Episode 4 (at 43 minutes in) of Season 2 of the Apple TV+ thriller series &quot;Slow Horses&quot; features the main character, Jackson Lamb, telling one of his agents &quot;as much as I like the idea of you going all Isla, She Wolf of the SS on him&quot; to back off confronting a Russian agent.

<doc id="1149324" wikidata="Q958950" url="?curid=1149324" title="Dorney Lake">
<text>Dorney Lake (also known as Eton College Rowing Centre, and as Eton Dorney as a 2012 Summer Olympics venue) is a purpose-built rowing lake and Meetings &amp; Events Venue in England. It is near the village of Dorney, Buckinghamshire, and is around 3 km (2 miles) west of Windsor and Eton, close to the River Thames.

The lake is privately owned and financed by Eton College, which spent £17 million developing it. Additional grants, totalling £500,000, were obtained from Sport England, UK Sport, the DCMS and SEEDA in order to build the lake&#x27;s finish tower. The project was completed in 2006, after 10 years of construction. The facilities are hired out for rowing, as well as for canoeing, Hospitality, dragon boating, and triathlon.

==2012 Olympic venue== 
The lake was used as the 2012 Summer Olympic venue for rowing and canoe sprint, and as the 2012 Summer Paralympic venue for rowing. For the duration of the Olympics, the lake was officially referred to as Eton Dorney; confusingly, a separate venue in Stratford was called &quot;Eton Manor&quot; due to 19th-century associations with the school.

To provide for Olympic spectators, the existing facilities were enhanced to include 20,000 additional seats; most of these seats were temporary. Construction of enhancements to Dorney Lake began in October 2009, following investigations by Oxford Archaeology, including a new cut-through between the competition lake and the return lane, a new bridge and an upgraded access road, funded by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). During the Olympic events, Dorney Lake was staffed by around 3,500 personnel including volunteers; it could accommodate up to 30,000 spectators per day. A temporary bridge over the River Thames linked the Dorney Lake site to Windsor Racecourse, where a pick-up and drop-off point for Olympic spectators was established. Other access options existed for walkers and cyclists.

==Past events==
Dorney Lake has hosted the following international rowing events:

* 2005 Rowing World Cup (26–28 May)
* 2005 Coupe de la Jeunesse (29–31 July)
* 2006 World Rowing Championships (20–27 August)
* 2011 World Rowing Junior Championships (3–7 August)
* 2012 Summer Olympics (27 July – 12 August: rowing from 28 July to 4 August, then canoe sprint)
* 2012 Summer Paralympics (29 August – 9 September: rowing from 31 August to 2 September)
* 2013 Rowing World Cup (21–23 June)
The lake also hosted the annual National Schools&#x27; Regatta from 2016-2024.

==Lake specifications==

The lake&#x27;s dimensions follow the FISA rules for a rowing lake suitable for hosting a World Rowing Championship, World Rowing Cup or Olympic regatta:
* Stillwater, with consistent water conditions
* straight length for racing
* 8 rowing lanes, each wide
* Minimum water depth of 
* A return channel allowing boats to move to the start, separated from the main lake by an island

==Home regattas==
Since the lake was opened, a number of annual regattas that were previously held on the River Thames have been transferred to the lake. These include the Marlow Regatta in June, the Metropolitan Regatta in May/June, and the Wallingford Regatta in May.

==Public access==
The public are allowed to use the grounds of Dorney Lake when sporting events are not being run. The two-kilometre-long flat, straight paths that run along each side of the main lake make it a popular venue for runners, skaters, and even cross-country skiers practising with roller skis. The picturesque landscape also makes it a popular location for dog walkers and people out for fun.

<doc id="1149325" wikidata="Q2020828" url="?curid=1149325" title="Downtown (Petula Clark song)">
<text>&quot;Downtown&quot; is a song written and produced by English composer Tony Hatch. Its lyrics speak of going to spend time in an urban downtown as a means of escape from everyday life. The 1964 version recorded by British singer Petula Clark became an international hit, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart. Hatch received the 1981 Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.

The song has been covered by many singers, including Dolly Parton, Emma Bunton and the Saw Doctors.

==Composition==
Tony Hatch first worked with Petula Clark when he assisted her producer Alan A. Freeman on her 1961 1 hit &quot;Sailor&quot;. In 1963 Freeman asked Hatch to take over as Clark&#x27;s regular producer. Hatch subsequently produced five English-language singles for Clark, none of which charted.

In the autumn of 1964 Hatch made his first visit to New York City, spending three days there in search of material from music publishers for the artists he was producing. He recalled, &quot;I was staying at a hotel on Central Park and I wandered down to Broadway and to Times Square and, naively, I thought I was downtown. ... I loved the whole atmosphere there and the [music] came to me very, very quickly&quot;. He was standing on the corner of 48th Street in Midtown, waiting for the traffic lights to change and looking towards Times Square when &quot;the melody first came to me, just as the neon signs went on.&quot;

Hatch envisioned his embryonic composition &quot;as a sort of doo wop R&amp;B song&quot;, which he thought to eventually pitch to the Drifters: He had scored his biggest success to date with the Searchers&#x27; &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; modelled on the Drifters&#x27; hit &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot;, and had also produced a cover version of the Drifters&#x27; &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; for Julie Grant. It has been said that Hatch gave Julie Grant the opportunity to record &quot;Downtown&quot; which Grant turned down, but this does not accord with Hatch&#x27;s statement that he played &quot;Downtown&quot; for Petula Clark within a few days of conceiving the melody and only completed the song&#x27;s lyrics after Clark had asked to record it. Hatch has also said that prior to Clark&#x27;s expressed interest in &quot;Downtown&quot;, &quot;it never occurred to me that a white woman could even sing it.&quot; Hatch has subsequently denied originally offering &quot;Downtown&quot; to the Drifters.

Within a few days of his New York City trip Hatch visited Paris to present Clark with three or four songs he had acquired from New York publishers for Clark to consider recording at a London recording session scheduled for 16 October 1964, which was roughly two weeks away. Hatch said of the meeting: &quot;She was not very enthusiastic about [the material] and asked me if I was working on anything new myself.&quot; According to Clark, besides the title lyric, Hatch had only written &quot;one or two lines.&quot; Hatch recalled: &quot;Reluctantly, I played her the tune of my New York inspiration and slipped in the word &#x27;Downtown&#x27; in the appropriate places.&quot; Clark, who first heard &quot;Downtown&quot; from her kitchen, having stepped away to make a pot of tea, told Hatch: &quot;That&#x27;s the one I want to record.&quot; &quot;Get that finished. Get a good lyric in it. Get a great arrangement and I think we’ll at least have a song we’re proud to record even if it isn’t a hit.&quot;

==Recording==
&quot;Downtown&quot; was recorded on 16 October 1964 at the Pye Studios in Marble Arch. Thirty minutes before the session was scheduled, Hatch was still touching up the song&#x27;s lyrics in the studio&#x27;s washroom. Hatch said of his arrangement: &quot;I had to connect with young record buyers... but not alienate Pet[ula]&#x27;s older core audience... The trick was to make a giant orchestra sound like a rock band.&quot; Hatch insisted that all session personnel on his productions be recorded performing together. The session personnel for the recording of &quot;Downtown&quot; were assembled in Studio One of Pye Recording Studios and included eight violinists, two viola players and two cellists, four trumpeters and four trombonists, five woodwind players with flutes and oboes, percussionists, a bass player and a pianist.

Also playing on the session were guitarists Vic Flick, Jimmy Page and Big Jim Sullivan, as well as drummer Ronnie Verrell, while the Breakaways provided the vocal accompaniment. Bobby Graham was also credited as being the drummer on the session. Brian Brocklehurst stated in 1995 that he played upright bass at the session. Hatch&#x27;s assistant Bob Leaper conducted. According to Petula Clark, the session for &quot;Downtown&quot; consisted of three takes with the second take ultimately chosen as the completed track yet, elsewhere, an &quot;extended&quot; version consisting of an instrumental and backing vocal track most likely from a session tape, makes this claim questionable.

==Impact==
Tony Hatch would recall playing the completed &quot;Downtown&quot; track for Pye Records executives saying: &quot;Nobody knew what to make of it and no release date was set. Then Pye&#x27;s general manager called and said Joe Smith – Warner Bros.&#x27; head of A&amp;R – was in London looking for British material. When Joe heard Pet[ula]&#x27;s record, he loved it and scheduled the single for urgent release in the [United] States&quot;. When Hatch, surprised by Smith&#x27;s enthusiasm for releasing &quot;Downtown&quot; in the US, asked if Smith didn&#x27;t consider &quot;Downtown&quot; to be a &quot;very English record&quot; Smith replied: &quot;It&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s just an observation from outside of America and it&#x27;s just beautiful and just perfect.&quot;

In the wake of Smith&#x27;s interest &quot;Downtown&quot; was released in the UK in November 1964. It entered the UK Top 50 dated 14 November 1964, ending a virtual two-year UK chart absence for Clark; of the ten singles she had released in the UK during that period only one, &quot;Chariot&quot;, had appeared in even the lower charts (No. 39 the spring of 1963). &quot;Downtown&quot; rose to No. 2 UK in December 1964, remaining there for three weeks, kept out of the No. 1 position by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;. &quot;Downtown&quot; reached No. 2 in Ireland and No. 1 in Australia, New Zealand, Rhodesia and South Africa, and was also a hit in Denmark (No. 2), India (No. 3), the Netherlands (No. 4) and Norway (No. 8).

But &quot;Downtown&quot; had its greatest significance in the reception it was afforded in the United States, where it was released by Warner Bros. in November 1964: after early regional break-outs, notably in Detroit, Miami, and Washington D.C., &quot;Downtown&quot; debuted at No. 87 on the Hot 100 chart in the &quot;Billboard&quot; issue dated 19 December 1964. Despite the Christmas season typically being the worst time to break a new hit, &quot;Downtown&quot; shot up to No. 41 in its second week on the Hot 100 chart ascending in its third and fourth charting weeks to respectively No. 12 and No. 5; then after a subsequent single point advance to No. 4 &quot;Downtown&quot; leapt to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 dated 23 January 1965, retaining that position a further week before being overtaken by the ascendancy of the Righteous Brothers&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot;. The song became the first No. 1 hit for the year 1965.

Petula Clark thus became the first UK female artist to have a US No. 1 hit during the rock era and the second in the annals of US charted music, Vera Lynn having hit No. 1 in the US with &quot;Auf Wiederseh&#x27;n Sweetheart&quot; in 1952. &quot;Downtown&quot; also made Clark the first UK female artist to have a single certified as a Gold record for US sales of one million units. On Billboard&#x27;s annual Disk Jockey poll, &quot;Downtown&quot; was voted the second best single release of 1965 and Petula Clark was voted third most popular female vocalist. &quot;Downtown&quot; would be the first of fifteen consecutive hits Clark would place in the US Top 40 during a period when she&#x27;d have considerably less chart impact in her native UK, there reaching the Top 40 eight times.

Petula Clark, who had been playing to her French-speaking fans in small venues in Quebec when &quot;Downtown&quot; entered the US charts, swiftly cut non-English versions of the song for the markets in France, Italy and Germany; the absence in each region&#x27;s language of a two-syllable equivalent of &quot;downtown&quot; necessitated a radical lyric recasting for the versions aimed at France (&quot;Dans le temps&quot;), Italy (&quot;Ciao Ciao&quot;, winning the Festivalbar, a juke-box contest) and Spain (&quot;Chao Chao&quot;) which respectively charted at No. 6, No. 2 and – for three weeks – No. 1: &quot;Dans le temps&quot; also reaching No. 18 on Belgium&#x27;s French-language chart. The title and lyric &quot;Downtown&quot; was retained for an otherwise German version which was the most successful foreign-language version, reaching No. 1 in Germany, No. 3 in Austria, and No. 11 on the charts for the Flemish region of Belgium.

In 2013, Petula Clark rerecorded that song for her album &quot;Lost in You&quot;, with new arrangements, as a ballad and with a soft voice, giving it a new life. 

===Popular culture===

In the 1991 film, &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;, Brad Johnson and Willem Dafoe sing the chorus portion of &quot;Downtown&quot; as they are flying their A-6 Intruder back to the aircraft carrier after the unauthorized bombing of the &quot;Sam City&quot; section of Hanoi in North Vietnam.

In the 1996 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Bottle Deposit&quot;, the song is referenced by George Costanza&#x27;s supervisor Wilhelm when discussing a project Costanza is in the dark about, prompting George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld to analyze the song&#x27;s lyrics for clues.

The song is on the soundtrack of the 1999 film &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; and is sung in character by Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.

The song is featured prominently in the beginning of the 2006 &quot;Lost&quot; episode &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

The song plays on a loop in a scene from the 2019 film &quot;Escape Room&quot;.

Immediately before the 2020 Nashville bombing, the song was played from the vehicle which exploded, followed by an audio warning to &quot;evacuate now&quot;. Clark released a statement expressing her &quot;shock and disbelief&quot; at the explosion in Nashville.

The song is featured in the Edgar Wright horror film &quot;Last Night in Soho&quot; performed by actress Anya Taylor-Joy.

==Downtown &#x27;88==

In addition, the original 1964 recording was remixed and released in 1988 as &quot;Downtown &#x27;88&quot;: a top ten UK hit, the track also charted in Australia (No. 58), Belgium (Dutch chart No. 19), Finland (No. 3), Germany (No. 13) and Ireland (No. 14). Clark recalled: &quot;The first time I heard the &#x27;88 remix of &#x27;Downtown&#x27; I was in my car. I thought: &#x27;This sounds familiar. I wonder who&#x27;s singing this?&#x27; and it turned out to be me! They&#x27;d wiped out the orchestra and put on some kind of ticka-ticka-tick thing. I don&#x27;t know what the hell it was, but it turned into a hit. They don&#x27;t have to ask my permission, if you know what I mean. But it&#x27;s fine. I find it rather flattering, actually. And quite amusing.&quot;

Clark in fact promoted &quot;Downtown &#x27;88&quot; in a live performance on 15 December 1988 broadcast of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (&quot;TOTP&quot;) – the track had been aired on the preceding &quot;TOTP&quot; broadcast of 8 December 1988 and had moved from No. 37 to No. 24 on the UK Singles Chart dated (i.e. for the week ending) 12 December 1988: Clark&#x27;s live &quot;TOTP&quot; performance evidently facilitated the rise of &quot;Downtown &#x27;88&quot; to No. 13 on the UK chart dated 17 December 1988, while the track reached its No. 10 peak on the UK chart dated 24 December 1988, that being the singles rankings for the first full week after Clark&#x27;s &quot;TOTP&quot; live performance of &quot;Downtown &#x27;88&quot;.

==Other re-recordings==
In October 2011, Clark recorded several lines of &quot;Downtown&quot; for inclusion in the remake by Irish band the Saw Doctors which was credited to the Saw Doctors featuring Petula Clark – (see below). Clark&#x27;s own 2013 album release &quot;Lost in You&quot; features a new version of &quot;Downtown&quot;: Clark said she was uninterested when it was first suggested she again record &quot;Downtown&quot;, then &quot;I was played this beautiful [instrumental] track ...And I said it was lovely, and they told me it was [intended for] &#x27;Downtown.&#x27; I got to the microphone and I didn&#x27;t know how I was going to sing it, and it really feels like a new song.&quot; Reviewing &quot;Lost in You&quot; for MusicOHM.com, Philip Matusavage writes of the &quot;Downtown&quot; remake: &quot;already a song loaded with melancholy, the stately version here acquires new meaning with its weary but amiable delivery summoning forth powerful nostalgia and the sense of someone fondly remembering their youth.&quot;

==Dolly Parton version==

Dolly Parton recorded &quot;Downtown&quot; in Nashville in 1983 in the sessions for her covers album &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;, a Val Garay production which focused on hits from the 1950s and 1960s. &quot;Downtown&quot; served as the album&#x27;s second single release in March 1984 reaching No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; C&amp;W chart and crossing over to No. 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart: to date &quot;Downtown&quot; marks Parton&#x27;s final solo Hot 100 appearance. Parton&#x27;s version altered some of the lyrics: &quot;Listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova&quot; became &quot;Listen to the rhythm of the music that they&#x27;re playing&quot;. Petula Clark has described Parton&#x27;s take on &quot;Downtown&quot; as &quot;cute, because she didn’t even try to sound like my recording.&quot;

==Emma Bunton version==
===Background===
BBC News announced 20 October 2006 that Emma Bunton would record a remake of the Petula Clark hit &quot;Downtown&quot; to be the 2006 official BBC Children in Need single, with Bunton quoted as saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved &#x27;Downtown&#x27;and I&#x27;m really looking forward to putting my own stamp on it. The track&#x27;s good fun and one everyone will know.&quot; Bunton, whose admiration for Petula Clark was evident on the 2004 &quot;Free Me&quot; album, recorded &quot;Downtown&quot; at AIR Studios&#x27; Lyndhurst Hall location with Simon Franglen producing; the orchestra for the track was recorded at Angel Recording Studios with Gavin Wright conducting. The track was released on 13 November 2006 and Bunton premiered her version of &quot;Downtown&quot; on the 2006 &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon which began broadcast 17 November 2006.

Although Bunton said that she knew &quot;Downtown&quot; composer Tony Hatch &quot;quite well&quot;, Petula Clark said that neither she [i.e. Clark] nor Hatch had prior knowledge of Bunton&#x27;s remake. Clark also stated that she considered Bunton&#x27;s remake to be an &quot;outright copy&quot; of Clark&#x27;s original recording: &quot;I could ask: &#x27;What&#x27;s the point&#x27;but Emma&#x27;s recording is wonderful andfor a great cause&quot; (i.e. Children in Need).

===Impact===
&quot;Downtown&quot; by Emma Bunton debuted on the UK singles chart 25 November 2006 at No. 24. Central FM noted Bunton&#x27;s chart debut, declaring &quot;Downtown&quot; &quot;the song she was born to coverOne of the all time great pop songs, [&#x27;Downtown&#x27;] was long overdue for a revival and Emma Bunton pays it the respect it deserves.&quot; The Spanish radio station predicted &quot;Downtown&quot; would rise to the Top 3 in its second week and the single did indeed jump to No. 3 on the chart for 2 December 2006 having sold 30,582 units in the relevant week: the mid-week stats had ranked &quot;Downtown&quot; at No. 2 behind &quot;Patience&quot; by Take That but on the chart for the full week Bunton was bested not only by Take That at No. 1 but by the previous week&#x27;s No. 1, &quot;Smack That&quot; by Akon, which outsold &quot;Downtown&quot; by 57 copies.

While affording Bunton her highest charting single since her No. 1 solo debut &quot;What Took You So Long?&quot; in 2001, &quot;Downtown&quot; would prove to have little staying power, spending only three weeks in the Top 20, performances by Bunton on a Christmas Day broadcast of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;New Year Live&quot; failing to significantly buoy its popularity. Total UK sales for &quot;Downtown&quot; by Emma Bunton were tallied at 77,039 units.

===Music video===
Directed by Harvey &amp; Carolyn, (the directors who also directed her video for her single &quot;Maybe&quot;) the sexually suggestive music video for the single is set in a hotel bedroom featuring Bunton as a maid. It includes appearances from contestants from the BBC&#x27;s reality television show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and features cameos from Matt Dawson, Louisa Lytton, Carol Smillie, Spoony, Mark Ramprakash, Claire King, Peter Schmeichel, Craig Revel Horwood, Anton du Beke, Brendan Cole, Erin Boag, Lilia Kopylova, Karen Hardy, and Darren Bennett. According to Mark Ramprakash the video was shot at &quot;a big house near Baker Street&quot;.

The video drew negative reaction for evidently skewing the phrase &quot;go downtown&quot; into a sexual term. Bunton would constantly evade or deny this allegation, as when Michael Baggs of Popjustice put to her: &quot;The dancers in the &#x27;Downtown&#x27; video seem to know you very well indeed. So well that they are all pointing at your fanny. Was this your idea?&quot;, Bunton&#x27;s response being: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand where this has come from. It is a dance routine and it is nothing to do with anything like that. It is everyone else&#x27;s dirty little minds. Especially yours. It worries me because it is a classic and you can&#x27;t make classics rude.&quot; Singer Jann Arden who recorded &quot;Downtown&quot; for her 2007 album &quot;Uncover Me&quot; reacted to Bunton&#x27;s &quot;Downtown&quot; video with the statement: &quot;Petula Clark would slap [Bunton&#x27;s] face&quot; though in fact Clark herself would state to being untroubled by Bunton&#x27;s evidently salacious interpretation of &quot;Downtown&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a pop song, for God&#x27;s sake. It&#x27;s not a hymn!&quot;

==Saw Doctors version==
In October 2011, Irish band the Saw Doctors remade &quot;Downtown&quot; with Petula Clark singing some lines: the track is credited to the Saw Doctors featuring Petula Clark. According to Saw Doctors&#x27; member Leo Moran the group habitually played snippets of well-known songs during their encore numbers: &quot;One night for no particular reason we did &#x27;Downtown&#x27; and you could see people loved it. All ages. You could see it brought joy to people’s faces.&quot; Some time later the Saw Doctors learned their producer Philip Tennant was friends with Petula Clark&#x27;s manager John Williams and an invitation was conveyed to Clark to sing on a Saw Doctors&#x27; remake of &quot;Downtown&quot;; Clark being agreeable, a session was booked in a London recording studio to allow the Irish group to liaison with the European-based Clark and &quot;Downtown&quot; was recorded over two days with Clark arriving to record her vocal on the second day. Moran recalls: &quot;We [the Saw Doctors] did a whole lot of work the first day. [Petula Clark] came in the second evening and we discovered that the song was in the wrong key. So we had to scrap all of the first day&#x27;s work and put down the backing track with Petula because she only had a few hours that evening and wasn’t able to come back the following day. It was exciting, exhilarating, scary and privileged … rolled into one.&quot;

Top Irish cinematographer Eugene O&#x27; Connor (&quot;Father Ted&quot;) directed the video for the Saw Doctor&#x27;s &quot;Downtown&quot; which was uploaded to YouTube on 17 November 2011. Shot on the nights of 9–10 November 2011, the video focuses on the band&#x27;s members walking through the town center of Galway (lead vocalist Davy Carton is also seen briefly riding in a car). Footage of Clark was shot in Paris and spliced into the completed video in which she mainly appears on the screens of televisions displayed in a shop window (the shop is in fact clothing retailer Anthony Ryans) outside of which the Saw Doctors perform on the street in the company of eight members of the Galway City Cougars cheerleading squad and also a fire juggler.

Radio presenter Ray Foley (Today FM) began a campaign to make the Saw Doctors&#x27; &quot;Downtown&quot; the Christmas No. 1 in Ireland for 2011 encouraging sales of the track upon its 16 December 2011 release with the intent of propelling it to the No. 1 position on the Irish Singles Chart for the week ending 22 December 2011 and the Saw Doctors&#x27; &quot;Downtown&quot; was indeed No. 1 on iTunes Ireland for the relevant period. However, on the Irish Singles Chart dated 22 December 2011 the track debuted at No. 2 with &quot;Cannonball&quot; by Little Mix retaining the No. 1 position largely because of &quot;Cannonball&quot;&#x27;s greater availability as a CD single – 10,000 units as opposed to &quot;Downtown&quot;&#x27;s 2000 – making &quot;Cannonball&quot; a more attractive prospect for gift-buyers.

On the Irish Singles Chart dated 29 December 2011 &quot;Downtown&quot; by the Saw Doctors featuring Petula Clark was ranked at No. 43 in its second and final week on the chart.

<doc id="1149326" wikidata="Q3303657" url="?curid=1149326" title="British Rail Class 456">
<text>The British Rail Class 456 was an electric multiple unit passenger train introduced by Network SouthEast on inner-suburban services in South London to replace the elderly Class 416 2EPB units. Twenty-four two-car units were built by British Rail Engineering Limited&#x27;s York Carriage Works in 1990 and 1991.

Following the privatisation of British Rail, the fleet was sold to Porterbrook and operated by Southern up until late 2013, when they were transferred to South West Trains and heavily refurbished. Routes that were operated by Class 456 units will be operated by new Class 701 Bombardier Aventra units in the future.

== Entry into service ==

While originally approved for use by Network SouthEast (NSE) on services out of Waterloo, the 24 two-car units were first accepted into traffic as direct replacements for the 2EPB units on the Central Division of the Southern Region of British Rail. Units were delivered into traffic painted in NSE blue, red and white livery with cabs based on the Class 321 units, and were initially based at Selhurst depot. Although Network SouthEast had shifted to units painted with pale grey, the Class 456s were introduced painted with a darker grey shade to match the livery of the Class 455 units they would be working with. Units were numbered in the range 456001–456024, each unit consisting of a driving motor (DMSO) and a driving trailer (DTSO).

Entry into service for the Class 456 was originally planned for 18 March 1991, with trains to be driver-only operated (without the presence of a guard). This meant that the driver had to have a clear view of the platform with a bank of CCTV cameras mounted at the platform end for this purpose, however it was discovered that the position of the CCTV cameras on the platforms were not visible from the driver&#x27;s position. To resolve this Selhurst depot designed a replacement fixing for the driver&#x27;s seat so that it could slide sideways, allowing a good view of the CCTV units. The modified drivers&#x27; seats were installed at Fratton Depot with the work completed by the end of July 1991, and services with the new units commenced in September 1991.

==Operations==
===Connex South Central and SouthCentral/Southern===
When Britain&#x27;s railways were privatised, the entire Class 456 fleet passed into the South Central franchise (later known as the Southern franchise), which was originally won by Connex South Central. Only one unit, No. 456024, was repainted in white and yellow Connex livery, when it was named &quot;Sir Cosmo Bonsor&quot; after a chairman of the South Eastern Railway. The rest of the fleet had remained in Network South East livery until summer 2006, when the fleet started to be repainted into Southern livery.

In 2000, Connex lost the South Central franchise to the Go-Ahead Group, who rebranded the company as Southern in 2004.

On 8 May 2012 it was announced by the Department for Transport that the entire fleet of 24 2-car Class 456s would transfer to South West Trains (SWT) in 2014, to be used in conjunction with South West Trains’s fleet on London inner-suburban lines.

The Southern services on the South London Line were withdrawn in 2012 and replaced by a new London Overground service, the East London Line, operated using new air-conditioned 5-car units. Southern also received 26 new 5 car Class 377/6 units and these entered service at the end of 2013, in place of 92 cascaded carriages promised for extra capacity. This gives a total of 50 replacement carriages in addition to the 92 carriages for extra capacity, leaving the 48 Class 456 carriages surplus to requirements at Southern.

===South West Trains and South Western Railway===

The units transferred to South West Trains following their career with Southern, as their operations on its Metro routes were replaced by the class 455s, later to be replaced by the class 377/6 units. South West Trains used the 456s to enhance peak-hour Metro services through Wimbledon from 8 to 10 coaches and to provide two additional morning peak services from Raynes Park to Waterloo. These changes took place from December 2014.

Class 456s were repainted in the red &quot;Metro&quot; version of South West Trains livery to match the and were refurbished to have a similar interior to the Class 455 before entering service between March 2014 and December 2014. On their transfer, their standard traction equipment was retained, leaving them as the only fleet on South West Trains to be powered by conventional DC traction gear.

The first units entered service with South West Trains on 23 March 2014 between Ascot and Guildford, replacing Class 458 trains with toilets and air conditioning. They initially ran in pairs (i.e. 2 x 2 car) still in Southern&#x27;s green livery, but without fleet names. 10 units were required to provide the half-hourly service. The one train per day from Clapham Junction (07:45) to Guildford via Ascot was also operated by two 456s, but the trains that ran through to Waterloo during the peak periods continued to be operated by Class 458 trains. The Class 456 trains were the main units on the line for a short time, but sets now operate alone on the line.

All units were refurbished by South West Trains.

In August 2017, all 456 units transferred to the new South Western franchisee, South Western Railway. South Western Railway subsequently withdrew the Class 456 fleet from service on 17 January 2022.

==Refurbishment==
In March 2005, No. 456006 was hauled to Wolverton where it was studied for corrosion assessment. This caused some doubt as to whether they would be refurbished. However, in a statement in April 2006 Southern said the class would receive a &#x27;refresh&#x27;, which meant they would not receive a refurbishment as major as the 455s, since the 456s are 10 years newer and already have high-backed seats (although of a different design). Also, new CCTV cameras and flooring were installed; this was not mentioned on the original refurbishment plan.

All units were instead &#x27;refreshed&#x27; and were painted into Southern green colours. No. 456006 was completed in a one-off promotional livery for rail safety on the Southern network. 456013 had an experimental cab-cooling system installed and 456022 had some experimental air-conditioning fitted, in an effort to make drivers&#x27; jobs more comfortable.

Southern removed the toilets from the trains, to provide more capacity. Despite this the Class 456 EMU trains lost two seats from each pair, due to a space being cleared for wheelchairs and pushchairs.

After the units transferred to South West Trains, a full refurbishment commenced in Wolverton where Class 456s received a new exterior livery and also a refurbished interior with new seating.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 15 August 2017, unit 456015 was damaged in a collision with an engineers train at Waterloo station, London. The cause was a wiring error in the signalling which meant that a set of points not correctly set was not detected. This was introduced as part of the testing of the temporary changes to the signalling during a major works programme at Waterloo. This allowed the signalling logic to detect that a set of points was correctly set when in reality, the points were mid-way between either of the correct positions. A false proceed signal was shown to the driver when it should not have been possible.

<text>Edna May Oliver (born Edna May Nutter, November 9, 1883 – November 9, 1942) was an American stage and film actress. During the 1930s, she was one of the better-known character actresses in American films, often playing tart-tongued spinsters.

==Career==
Born in Malden, Massachusetts, the daughter of Ida May and Charles Edward Nutter, Oliver quit school at age 14 to pursue a stage career. 

She achieved her first success in 1917 on Broadway in Jerome Kern&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot;, playing the hero&#x27;s comically dour Aunt Penelope. In 1925, Oliver appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Cradle Snatchers&quot;, costarring Mary Boland, Gene Raymond, and Humphrey Bogart. Oliver&#x27;s most notable stage appearance was as Parthy, wife of Cap&#x27;n Andy Hawks, in the original 1927 stage production of the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;. She reprised her role in the 1932 Broadway revival, but turned down the chance to play Parthy in the 1936 film version to play the Nurse in that year&#x27;s film version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Her film debut was in 1923 in &quot;Wife in Name Only&quot;. She continued to appear in films until &quot;Lydia&quot; in 1941. She first gained major notice in films for her appearances in several comedies starring the team of Wheeler &amp; Woolsey, including &quot;Half Shot at Sunrise&quot;, her first film under her RKO Radio Pictures contract in 1930. Usually in featured parts, she starred in ten films, including &quot;Fanny Foley Herself&quot; (1931) and &quot;Ladies of the Jury&quot; (1932). She played wealthy, domineering Aunt March in the 1933 version of &quot;Little Women&quot;.


Oliver&#x27;s most popular star vehicles were mystery-comedies, starring as spinster sleuth Hildegarde Withers from the popular Stuart Palmer novels. The series ended prematurely when she left RKO to sign with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1935; the studio attempted to continue the series with Helen Broderick and then ZaSu Pitts as Withers.

While at MGM, David O. Selznick cast Oliver in two film versions of novels by Charles Dickens, as the prim, acidic Miss Pross &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1935), starring Ronald Colman, and as the title character&#x27;s eccentric aunt, Betsy Trotwood in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (also 1935).

She appeared in the Shirley Temple film &quot;Little Miss Broadway&quot; (1938) as the landlord of a hotel for vaudevillians who wants to shut it down. She also performed in two 1939 movie musicals: with Tyrone Power in the Sonja Henie skating film &quot;Second Fiddle&quot;, and in a supporting role as the agent of the title characters in the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot;. A 1940 comic performance as Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Mr. Darcy&#x27;s domineering aunt Lady Catherine de Bourgh in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and a 1941 role as Merle Oberon&#x27;s grandmother in &quot;Lydia&quot; concluded her film career.

She was also cast in noncomedic films such as &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931), &quot;Ann Vickers&quot; (1933), and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936).

==Death==
Oliver died at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital (today Cedars-Sinai Medical Center) on her 59th birthday in 1942 shortly after being diagnosed with abdominal cancer, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Awards and honors==
Oliver received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1939).

<text>Chenjerai &quot;Hitler&quot; Hunzvi (23 October 1949 – 4 June 2001) served as Chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association beginning in 1997.

==Early life==
Hunzvi was born in Chiminya, Southern Rhodesia, on 23 October 1949. He said that he joined the struggle against white minority rule in Rhodesia at the age of 16 taking the nom-de-guerre of &quot;Hitler&quot;. He was reported to have been interned in Gonakudzingwa and Wha Wha prisons between 1967 and 1970, and to have been a prominent leader in Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) and Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), though these claims have been denied by some other elders of the campaigns. He left the country and having been identified as being bright, was sent to study in Romania, becoming fluent in Romanian and French, and subsequently began medical studies in Poland where he married a Polish woman with whom he had two children. He represented ZAPU while in Poland, and in 1979, during his medical studies, Hunzvi visited London to attend the ceasefire and constitutional negotiations for the Lancaster House Agreement.

Hunzvi returned to Zimbabwe in 1990, working initially at Harare Central Hospital, and later founding a medical practice in Budiriro, in the township of Harare. His wife fled Zimbabwe in 1992 to escape violence from her husband. She described Hunzvi as a &quot;cruel and vile man who took delight in beating me. And as for the war, he never fired a shot. He saw no action at all.&quot; He subsequently remarried and has two other children.

==Political career==
Hunzvi was subsequently elected chairman of the Zimbabwean Liberation War Veterans&#x27; Association in 1997, which was, at the time, a relatively inactive organisation. A born orator, Hunzvi organised rowdy demonstrations demanding gratuities and pensions from President Robert Mugabe, and critiqued the president. The pressure tactics were successful and the 50,000 war veterans were granted one-off payments of US$2,500, as well as monthly pensions of US$100. A compensation fund was also set up to benefit those who were disabled following war service, with the amount paid determined by the degree of disability. The fund was the subject of enormous fraud, with government officials, party officials and others (including Hunzvi) determined to be 117% disabled. Experts have claimed that the settlements were a major factor in the economic crisis in Zimbabwe.

In 1999, Hunzvi was arrested in corruption case regarding the alleged embezzlement of Z$45m of the war veterans&#x27; funds. He was denied bail, due to fear that he would intimidate witnesses or abscond. The actual trial was repeatedly postponed, and the war veterans&#x27; leadership voted to remove him from office. In 2000 Hunzvi led the campaign involving war veterans and other supporters of ZANU-PF in the seizure of white-owned land. During parliamentary elections in 1999, he incited followers to intimidate and harass members of the opposition group, the Movement for Democratic Change. Calling himself &quot;the biggest terrorist in Zimbabwe&quot; he was identified by numerous witnesses for participation in beatings and torture, and his medical clinic labelled a &quot;torture chamber&quot; by Amnesty International in 2000.

Hunzvi was elected to parliament in 2000, but died in 2001 in Harare&#x27;s Parirenyatwa Hospital. His death was variously ascribed to malaria, a heart condition, or AIDS.

<text>William McLaren (1923–1987) was a Scottish illustrator.

==Life==
Born in Ferniegair, Hamilton, McLaren grew up in Cardenden, Fife, Scotland with a crippling handicap that affected his feet. He attended Beath High School, Cowdenbeath, before going to college in Edinburgh. In 1944 he earned his Diploma and the Highly Commended Post Diploma from Edinburgh College of Art. After graduation and with a bursary from the Andrew Grant Fund he left Scotland and visited Italy and France. Throughout his life he remained a francophile and was fluent in French.

He earned a living as a commercial illustrator working for &quot;The Radio Times&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot; and The Sphere. He is noted for illustrating and designing dust jackets for the popular gardening books by Beverley Nichols. He also painted murals at Wemyss Castle, St Adrian&#x27;s Church in West Wemyss, Hopetoun House, Hawthornden Castle and Tyninghame House.

==Legacy==
In 2009 a documentary film was made by Jim Hickey and Robin Mitchell about McLaren&#x27;s life and work entitled &#x27;William McLaren – An Artist Out of Time&#x27;. The film was shown at the 2010 Glasgow Film Festival as part of their &#x27;Great Scots&#x27; strand before touring Scotland&#x27;s regional cinemas.

In July 2011 Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery hosted an exhibition called &#x27;New Additions&#x27;. The exhibition included works by William McLaren, Anne Redpath and Sir Joseph Noel Paton.

<doc id="1149356" wikidata="Q7365088" url="?curid=1149356" title="Ronald Maddison">
<text>Leading Aircraftman Ronald George Maddison (23 January 1933 – 6 May 1953) was a twenty-year-old Royal Air Force mechanic who was unlawfully killed as the result of exposure to nerve agents while acting as a voluntary test subject at Porton Down, in Wiltshire, England. After substantial controversy, his death was the subject of an inquest 51 years after the event.

== Sarin test and death ==

Porton Down had been testing sarin on humans since October 1951, but the first adverse reaction was not recorded until February 1953. An even more severe reaction occurred on 27 April when one of six volunteers, a man named John Patrick Kelly, was exposed to 300 milligrams of sarin and fell into a coma but subsequently recovered. This prompted a reduction in the dose used in this series of experiments to 200 mg.

Along with other servicemen, Maddison was offered 15 shillings and a three-day leave pass for taking part in the experiments. He had planned to use the money to purchase an engagement ring for his girlfriend, Mary Pyle.

On the day he died, Ronald Maddison entered a gas chamber at 10:00 a.m. along with five other test subjects. They were each to have an identical experiment performed on them which was part of a series of experiments to determine the lethal dose of sarin when delivered to bare or battle dress-covered skin. The method used was to measure the change in active acetylcholinesterase in red blood cells at small dose levels and extrapolate this to work out what the effect of larger doses would be. Sarin is extremely poisonous because it attacks the nervous system by blocking the activity of cholinesterase enzymes present in it, including acetylcholinesterase. The method was practical because red blood cell membranes contain forms of acetylcholinesterase.

The participants were wearing respirators, with woollen hats and oversize overalls but no proper protective clothing. Two technicians were also present to carry out the experiment. The respirators were tested by exposing the men to tear gas in the chamber before the experiment started.
Maddison was the fourth to have the drops applied, at 10:17 having twenty 10 mg drops of sarin applied to the two layers of cloth used in uniforms, serge and flannel, which had been taped to the inside of his left forearm. After twenty minutes, Maddison began to sweat and complain that he did not feel well. One eye witness reported at the second inquest that he slumped over the table. The contaminated cloth was removed and he left the chamber, walking (perhaps with help) about 30 metres to a bench.

An ambulance was called and shortly afterwards Maddison complained of deafness, collapsed and began gasping for breath and the scientists injected him with atropine after they witnessed an asthma-like attack and convulsions. An ambulance took him to the site&#x27;s local medical facility, where he arrived at 10:47. Attempts were made to resuscitate him using oxygen, further injections of atropine and anacardone, and finally an injection of adrenaline into his heart just after 11 am. Although he had died at 11 am, less than 45 minutes after being exposed to the poison, he was not formally pronounced dead until 1:30 pm.

==Aftermath==
The post mortem was carried out in Salisbury Infirmary. On 8 and 16 May 1953, an inquest was held in secret before the Wiltshire Coroner, Harold Dale, who returned a verdict of misadventure. Maddison&#x27;s father was permitted to attend the inquest but warned that he would be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act if he informed anyone, including his family, of the circumstances surrounding his son&#x27;s death. An internal court of inquiry at Porton Down found that Maddison had died because of &quot;personal idiosyncrasy&quot;, either because he was unusually sensitive to the poison or his skin absorbed it faster than in other test subjects.

The Ministry of Defence delivered Ronald Maddison&#x27;s body in a steel coffin with the lid bolted down to maintain secrecy. A large number of samples of body parts including brain and spinal cord tissue, skin, muscle, stomach, lung, and gut were retained without his family&#x27;s knowledge or permission and used over several years in other toxicology experiments. Maddison&#x27;s father, John Maddison, was paid £40 to cover the funeral expenses, made up of £20 for black clothes, £16 for undertaker&#x27;s fees and £4 for catering.

==Second inquest ==
Operation Antler was a police investigation from 1999 to 2004 into Maddison&#x27;s death, and into allegations that other British chemical-weapons test participants between 1939 and 1989 had not been properly informed and may have been misled about the experiments and their risks.

As a result of the investigation, and campaigning by Ronald Maddison&#x27;s family, Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf, sitting with Mrs Justice Hallett in the High Court quashed the original inquest verdict in November 2002. A new inquest opened on 5 May 2004 and was the longest held in England and Wales up to that time, hearing around 100 witnesses over 50 days. On 15 November 2004, the inquest jury returned the verdict that Ronald Maddison had been unlawfully killed.

The Ministry of Defence applied for a judicial review to quash the unlawful killing verdict, although the government announced that whatever the outcome they would look &quot;favourably&quot; upon paying compensation to Maddison&#x27;s family. In February 2006 an agreement was struck within the framework of the judicial review whereby the MoD accepted the inquest verdict on the grounds that Maddison had died through &quot;gross negligence in the planning and conduct of the experiment&quot;. The MoD did not accept that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that Maddison had not given his informed consent to take part. Ronald Maddison&#x27;s relatives received a total of £100,000 in compensation from the Ministry of Defence.

The Crown Prosecution Service announced in 2003 that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone responsible for the tests, but that they would review this decision following Maddison&#x27;s second inquest. In June 2006, they confirmed that there would be no prosecutions.

<text>Occitania (; , , ; ) is the historical region in Southern Europe where the Occitan language was historically spoken and where it is sometimes used as a second language. This cultural area roughly encompasses much of the southern third of France (except the French Basque Country and French Catalonia) as well as part of Spain (Aran Valley), Monaco, and parts of Italy (Occitan Valleys). 

Occitania has been recognized as a linguistic and cultural concept since the Middle Ages. The territory was united in Roman times as the &quot;Seven Provinces&quot; () and in the Early Middle Ages (&quot;Aquitanica&quot; or the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse, or the share of Louis the Pious following Thionville &quot;divisio regnorum&quot; in 806).

Currently, the region has a population of 16 million, and between 200,000 and 800,000 people are either native or proficient speakers of Occitan. More commonly, French, Piedmontese, Catalan, Spanish and Italian are spoken. Since 2006, the Occitan language has been an official language in Catalonia, which includes the Aran Valley, where Occitan gained official status in 1990.

At the time of the Roman empire, most of Occitania was known as Aquitania. The territories conquered early were known as &quot;Provincia Romana&quot; (see modern Provence), while the northern provinces of what is now France were called &quot;Gallia&quot; (Gaul). Under the late Roman empire, both Aquitania and &quot;Provincia Romana&quot; were grouped in the Seven Provinces or Viennensis. Provence and Gallia Aquitania (or &quot;Aquitanica&quot;) have been in use since medieval times for Occitania (i.e. Limousin, Auvergne, Languedoc and Gascony).

The historic Duchy of Aquitaine should not be confused with the modern French region called Aquitaine: this is a reason why the term &quot;Occitania&quot; was revived in the mid-19th century. The terms &quot;Occitania&quot; and &quot;Occitan language&quot; (&quot;Occitana lingua&quot;) appeared in Latin texts from as early as 1242–1254 to 1290 and during the early 14th century; texts exist in which the area is referred indirectly as &quot;the country of the Occitan language&quot; (&quot;Patria Linguae Occitanae&quot;). The name was used in Italian (&quot;Lingua d&#x27;òc&quot;) by Dante in the late 13th century. The somewhat uncommon ending of the term &quot;Occitania&quot; is most likely from a French clerk who joined the &quot;òc&quot; and &quot;Aquitània&quot; in a portmanteau term, thus blending the language and the land in just one concept.

On 28 September 2016, Occitanie became the name of an administrative region that succeeded the regions of Midi-Pyrénées and Languedoc-Roussillon;
it is a small part of Occitania.

==Geographic extent==

The extent of Occitania may vary according to the criteria used:
* Based on a geolinguistic definition, Occitania is the area of Occitan language as surveyed at the end of the 19th century. The formerly Occitanophone regions are not included.

On the other hand one always speaks Occitan in the French Basque Country and in the Catalan Countries (the Val d&#x27;Aran and the Fenolheda), and internal allophone enclaves (Petite Gavacharie of Poitevin-Saintongeais language, ancient Ligurian enclaves of eastern Provence, the quasi-Ligurian-Occitan enclave of Monaco ...). This leads to variations in whether small internal or external enclaves are taken into account. The definition of a contiguous and compact Occitan-speaking territory is currently the most widespread.

* Occitanian culture flourished in the High Middle Ages. Many writers, poets, and exponents in the troubadour movement used Occitan as their language of choice, and their works prominently featured courtly love as well as, at times, ideas of religious and social tolerance. According to this definition taken up by historians and anthropologists, the domain is extended north to the Loire including former Occitanophone regions (Aguiaine, Boischaut, Bourbonnais, etc.).

Northern Italy and the Catalan Countries were also homes of troubadour using the Koiné Occitan literary. In the same way, the Basque Country and Aragon benefited from Occitan stands, old or newer, which notably gave rise to the appearance of an Occitan dialect south of the Pyrenees. We can also note the historical use of an Occitan scripta as official language.

The name Occitanie appeared in the Middle Ages on the basis of a geographical, linguistic and cultural concept, to designate the part of the French royal domain speaking the langue d’oc.

Its current definition is variable. In the most common usage, Occitania designates the territory where the Occitan has remained in use until today, within the limits defined between 1876 and the 20th century. If Occitan language and culture are almost always associated with it, we also find references to a common history, an ethnic group, a homeland, to a people or to a nation. The first sociological study in the Occitan language to learn how the Occitan define themselves was started in 1976. The survey shows that the Occitan reality is defined by &quot;language&quot; for 95% of people, &quot;culture&quot; (94%), characterization by &quot;a common history&quot; (69%), &quot;an ethnic group&quot; (50%), &quot;a nation&quot; (20%). Occitania, as defined by the modern Occitan linguistic territory, covers most of the current Southern France, the Alpine valleys of the Western Piedmont, in Italy, Val d&#x27;Aran in Spain and Monaco an area of approximately 190,000 km2. It had about fifteen million inhabitants in 1999 with about 20% inhabitants born outside the territory and about 20% of natives who left. On the other hand, in the absence of a linguistic census, we only imperfectly know the number of speakers of Occitan.

If the preceding notions are generally limited to the modern linguistic boundaries of Occitan, this term can also be used to designate a larger territory. The term &quot;Occitania&quot; becomes commonplace more and more in the vocabulary of scientists. It is used particularly in a historical sense and anthropological by designating a region extending north to the Loire, ignoring contemporary linguistic boundaries. In a book written by experts in medieval history, are included in Occitania of the year 1000 both the provinces of the north (now mainly in Poitou-Charentes) and Catalonia (without the Balearic Islands and the Valencian country) – &quot;p. 484&quot;. The seven-pointed star, adopted as emblem by the Felibritge symbolized the seven provinces of Occitania, one of which was Catalan. Occitanie is indeed divided by this association into seven maintenances (sections) of which one was that of Catalonia-Roussillon.

In 2016, the name &quot;Occitanie&quot; is used for the French administrative region Languedoc-Roussillon-Midi-Pyrénées which is located on part of the traditional Occitania and includes the Roussillon.

==Toponymies==
&quot;Occitania&quot; comes from the medieval Latin &quot;Occitania&quot;. The first part of the name, &quot;Occ-&quot;, comes from Occitan &quot;òc&quot; and the expression &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot;, in Italian &quot;lingua d&#x27;oc&quot;. It is an appellation promoted by Dante Alighieri of Occitan by the way of saying &quot;yes&quot; in Old Occitan-Catalan; as opposed to the &quot;langue de si&quot; (Italian) and the &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; (Old French). The ending &quot;-itania&quot; is probably an imitation of the name &quot;[Aqu] itania&quot; (Aquitaine). The term Occitania is a synonym for Languedoc and the Mediterranean coast in the Middle Ages.

The first attestation of the use of &quot;Occitanie&quot; in French dates from 1556. The first certificate of &quot;Occitania&quot; in Italy dates 1549. In German, the word Occitania was found in 1572.

All of the Occitan language countries have had various designations throughout history. The word &quot;Occitania&quot; has been the subject of whimsical etymologies (for example, Languedoc was formerly understood as &quot;land of the Goths&quot; or &quot;language of the Goths&quot;), as well as the rapprochement to the Occitan language exemplified in the names of the regions Languedoc and Occitania, we find in &quot;La Minerve Française&quot;, a collective work published in Paris in 1818, a history of name-changes of the provinces which reveals the word Occitanie to be a doublet of the word Occident formed in the Lower Empire, giving it the original meaning of &quot;western regions&quot;, and not a region where (necessarily) the Occitan language was spoken.

Like the Occitan language, Occitania has been designated under various successive names. The terms are not exclusive: one can find authors who use different terms in the same time period. &quot;Occitania&quot; or &quot;Pays d&#x27;Oc&quot; are the most frequently used terms today. However the term &quot;Provence&quot; is still used when the Felibritge sing the Copa Santa for example during the &quot;annual festival of Estello&quot;.
* Dioecesis Viennensis (Diocese de Vienne) et Dioecesis Septem Provinciarum (diocesis of the Seven provinces), under Diocletian and Constantine during a division of the Roman Empire, Gaul is divided into dioceses and that of Vienne has its border on the Loire river, bypasses the Central Massif and passes the Rhône between Lyon and Vienne. This is the beginning of the bipartition between Occitan language and langue d&#x27;oil.
* Kingdom of Aquitaine: in 781, Charlemagne creates a new kingdom of Aquitaine and names his son Louis the Pious to his head. This new state included the Aquitaine properly speaking (region between Garonne and Loire and the central Massif) as well as the Vasconia. In 806, Charlemagne shares his empire. Louis the Pious receives in addition to Aquitaine the Marca Hispanica, Septimania and Provence.
* Proensa/Proença (old Occitan forms of Provence) and Prouvènço/Provença (Occitan modern forms of Provence), from the Latin &quot;Provincia&quot; which originally designated the Roman Province is used from the 11th century: all countries of Occitan language (also called Provençal language) of the south of the Loire. The term &quot;Provence&quot; is still used in its general sense by the Felibritgists.
* Great Provence according to Palestra, Centenary of the Catalan Renaixença.
* Patria romana.
* Lingua Occitana (Occitan language) or Pars occitana (Part of oc) to designate the new royal territories conquered south of the Loire. Occitania was created in Latin by the Capetian administration with the combination of the particle &#x27;Oc/òc&#x27; [ɔk] (yes, in Occitan) and of the &#x27;Aquitania/Aquitània″ [ɑkitanjɑ] (Aquitaine). Appeared in the 13th century, this term served, after the annexation of almost all the countries of the South by France, to designate only the Languedoc.
* Respublica Occitania (Occitania Republic) during the 14th century.
* Romania (Roumanío), in reference to the medieval usage of calling Occitan the &quot;roman&quot;.
* Homeland of the Occitan language (Latin &quot;patria linguae occitanae&quot;), in the official texts of the Kingdom of France from the 14th century.
* Provinces of the Union or United Provinces of the South: in February 1573 the huguenots and the moderate Catholics create a federal republic where each province enjoys a great autonomy vis-a-vis the central power.
* Gascony after the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, &quot;the general name of Gascony or Gascons is used to refer to the countries and peoples to the left side of the Loire where still speaks the old Provençal&quot;. Used mainly from the access to the throne of France of Henri IV (1589) and until the French Revolution.
* Reputed foreign provinces of the south of France since the middle of the 17th century at the end of the 18th century
* Occitania in the Diderot Encyclopaedia.
* Occitanie (in the sense of all the Occitan languages): in 1732 in the collection of Capetian laws of Shake Secousse, in 1878, in the &quot;Treasure of the Felibritge&quot;, in 1911 in the Statutes of the Felibritge; in 1927, Estieu and Salvat founded the &quot;College of Occitania&quot;.
* Midi: is a vague geographical notion indicating in a rather imprecise way the regions of Occitan dialects of Southern France.
* Southern France: is another vague geographical name indicating in a rather imprecise way the regions of Occitan dialects of Southern France.
* Pays d&#x27;Oc: appeared in the 19th century under the impetus of Frederic Mistral, taken over by Antonin Perbòsc four years later.
* Estate of Oc: neologism appeared at the end of the 20th century among supporters of several Occitan languages.

The term &quot;Occitania&quot; now covers a linguistic region. This meaning was used in medieval times attested since 1290. On 29 May 1308, during the Council of Poitiers, it appears that the king of France was declared to reign over two nations: one of &quot;lingua gallica&quot; and the other of lingua occitana. This partition between Occitan language and langue d&#x27;oïl in the Gallo-Roman space is very ancient since it started with Romanisation itself. In 1381, the King Charles VI of France considered that his kingdom comprised two parts: the country of langue d&#x27;oc, or Occitania, and the oil-language country or Ouytanie &quot;Quas in nostro Regno occupare solebar tam in linguae Occitanae quam Ouytanae&quot;. &quot;Occitania&quot; remained in force in the administration until the French Revolution of 1789. It was taken up again in the 19th century by the literary association of Felibritge then it is again claimed since the 20th century, especially since the end of the 1960s. According to Frédéric Mistral&#x27;s dictionary &quot;Treasury of Felibritge&quot;, the term Occitania is sometimes used by scholars to describe Southern France in general but mainly for the former province of Languedoc.

==Historiography of the Occitania concept==
The &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot; is a territorialized language, that is to say, spoken mainly on a territory whose boundaries can be described. This part attempts to describe the origins of the Occitanie concept, the different names that this territory has taken and the creation of the modern concept of Occitania.

===A unique object of study: d&#x27;oc culture===
The speakers of the Occitan language do not use a single meaning of their language because Occitan is not a monolithic language with for example a single dictionary where each speaker finds exactly their vocabulary, but a juxtaposition of dialects. Also, many studies have focused on the differences between Provençal, Languedoc, etc. We must also remember the many common features of the Occitan cultural space, which are generally considered partisans.

====The consciousness of a common culture====
Robert Lafont develops this idea in the introduction of the &quot;History and Anthology of Occitan Literature&quot;. The reference to troubadours is essential. This socio-linguistic argument is modulated according to the authors but it is accepted by all the current scholarship, including the authors who speak of &quot;domain d&#x27;oc&quot;, since by definition, their study of the d&#x27;oc domain rests on the consciousness of the existence of a common culture.

====Intercomprehension====
The different speakers of the language share many common traits (tonic accentuation, close vocabulary, frequent use of the subjunctive, etc.) that allow mutual understanding. For Occitanists, this intercomprehension means that Occitan is one language; for others, it means that these languages are very close but all agree that the speakers in this defined space understand each other.

====Common social characteristics====
The social characteristics of Occitania are not eternal and intangible because factors of endogenous mutations and European influences, especially of Northern France, can blur these social peculiarities.

The best studied example is that of Roman Law which is better maintained in the Occitan Early Middle Ages society than in Northern France thanks to the promulgations of Visigoth and Burgundians laws. From the mid-11th century, the teaching of the Corpus Juris Civilis taken shortly after Bologna in the universities of Toulouse, Montpellier, Avignon, Perpignan... will promote a massive renaissance of Roman Law in Occitania.

With regard to education: Pierre Goubert and Daniel Roche write, to explain the low literacy in Occitania in the 18th century, that there exists in these territories a confidence maintained in the old vulgar languages. The relations to education are today completely reversed between Northern and Southern France thanks to the anthropological imprint of the family strain.

From a demographic point of view, the influence of the family was still felt in 2007 because of the small number of families with many children.

In politics, many debates have also taken place around the expression &quot;Red Southern&quot; coined by Maurice Agulhon to find out if the &quot;pays d&#x27;oc&quot; was more &quot;republic&quot; than the northern half of France. Emmanuel Todd analyzing the regions that voted for Jean-Luc Mélenchon, calling himself a &quot;Republican&quot; in the 2012 presidential elections, declares that &quot;what is obvious is his general inscription in the Occitan family[...] that loves vertical structures, the state or the church.&quot;

Finally, for André Armengaud, these common social characteristics make it possible to write a historical synthesis. But since 1979, no other &quot;History of Occitan&quot; has been undertaken.

===The appearance of the modern concept of Occitania===
If the term Occitania appeared in French from the mid-16th century, then in 1732 in a collection of laws of the ancien régime, it only becomes current at 19th century. Thus, the duke of Angoulême conspired with a view to the establishment of a Kingdom of Occitania or of a Vice-Royalty of Occitania at the time of the Restoration. The term was popularized by the publications of Raynouard and Rochegude, and known in its contemporary sense by the English historian Sharon Turner.
It appeared in the &quot;Treasury of Felibritge&quot; and in the statutes of this organization in 1911. In the Interwar period, a Felibritgan school, the &quot;Escòla Occitana&quot; was created in 1919 in the Toulousean Languedoc. The Institute of Occitan Studies was born in 1930. These initiatives (as well as others) remain closely linked, notably because of the dual membership of their main animators at Felibritge.

After the Second World War, the creation of the Institute of Occitan Studies was presided over by a resistant (at a time when the Felibritge like the SEO were tainted by lawsuits of collaboration), but above all its action in terms of linguistic reform, particularly its desire to adapt the classical norm to Provençal, marked a break with a large fraction of the Felibritge François Fontan created the first overtly Occitan nationalist party in 1959.

In France, Occitania has been confronted with a problem of recognition of Occitan since 1992; the French is the only &quot;language of the Republic&quot;. In 1994, it was made compulsory in the public space (places of commerce and work, public transport, etc.) and in the administration (laws, regulations, documents, judgments, etc.).

In 2015, with the prospect of creating a large region gathering &quot;Midi-Pyrénées&quot; and &quot;Languedoc-Roussillon&quot;, the name &quot;Occitanie&quot; came at the head of an online survey organized by the regional press (23% of the 200,000 voting, in front of &quot;Occitanie-Pays catalan&quot; 20%). Note, however, a variable support rate depending on the geographical origin of the voters. As part of the territorial reform, a consultation on the name of the region, organized by the Regional Council Languedoc-Roussillon-Midi-Pyrénées took place in spring 2016 to give a name to the new region regrouping Midi-Pyrenees and Languedoc-Roussillon. Occitanie came first (44.90% of the vote), with 91,598 voters. Second was Languedoc-Pyrenees with 17.81% of the votes, then Pyrenees-Mediterranean (15.31%), Occitanie-Catalan Country (12.15%) and finally Languedoc (10.01%). This new region was renamed &quot;Occitanie&quot; (with the subtitle &quot;Pyrenees-Mediterranean&quot;), according to the vote of the regional councillors on June 24, 2016, and after final validation by the Government of France and Conseil d&#x27;État.

=== Distinction between Occitania and Catalonia ===
Despite the historic and political dependencies between the 10th and 13th centuries that eventually led to the creation of a common Occitan-Catalan cultural environment during Middle Ages, neither the Principality of Catalonia nor the Catalan Countries have ever been part of Occitania. On the contrary, from the 11th century the Catalan expansion towards the Occitan regions of Languedoc and Provence (through family ties of feudal nobility) gave rise to a long-term confrontation between the countal dynasties of Barcelona and Toulouse, but finally they had to ally against the Cathar Crusade promoted by France and the Papacy in the beginning of the 13th century. The great defeat resulting from the Battle of Muret (1213) and the subsequent Treaty of Corbeil (1258) ratified the loss of Catalan influence in Occitania and its gradual replacement by the French dynasty of the House of Capet.

Regarding to linguistic affinity and closeness, after some early Romance-language scholars considered them to be the same language, Catalan intellectuals (among them Pompeu Fabra and Joan Coromines) solemnly proclaimed in a 1934 manifesto that Catalan was a distinct language from Occitan, as established by the common consensus of current scientific linguistics.

Moreover, the Parliament of Catalonia passed in 2015 a law recognizing Aran Valley&#x27;s &quot;national identity&quot;, understood as an &quot;Occitan national reality&quot; apart from the Catalan nation.

==Geography==

Occitania includes the following regions:
* The southern half of France: Provence, Drôme-Vivarais, Auvergne, Limousin, Guyenne, Gascony, southern Dauphiné and Languedoc. French is now the dominant language in this area, where Occitan is not recognized as an official language.
* The Occitan Valleys in the Italian Аlps, where the Occitan language received legal status in 1999. These are fourteen Piedmontese valleys in the provinces of Cuneo and Turin, as well as in scattered mountain communities of the Liguria region (province of Imperia), and, unexpectedly, in one community (Guardia Piemontese) in the region of Calabria (province of Cosenza).
* The Aran valley, in the Pyrenees, in Catalonia where Occitan has been an official language since 1990 (status granted by the partial autonomy of Aran Valley, then confirmed by the Catalan Statute)
* The Principality of Monaco (where Occitan is traditionally spoken beside Monégasque).

Occitan or langue d&#x27;oc (&quot;lenga d&#x27;òc&quot;) is a Latin-based Romance language in the same way as Spanish, Italian or French. There are six main regional varieties, with easy inter-comprehension among them: Provençal (including Niçard spoken in the vicinity of Nice), Vivaroalpenc, Auvernhat, Lemosin, Gascon (including Bearnés spoken in Béarn) and Lengadocian. All these varieties of the Occitan language are written and valid. Standard Occitan is a synthesis which respects soft regional adaptations.

Catalan is a language very similar to Occitan and there are quite strong historical and cultural links between Occitania and Catalonia.

===Historic regions===
The regions of Ancien Régime that make up Occitania are the following: Auvergne (Auvèrnhe), Forez (west and south fringe), Bourbonnais (southern half), Couserans (Coserans), Dauphiné (southern half), County of Foix (County of Fois), County of Nice (County of Nissa), Périgord (Peiregòrd), Gascony, Guyenne (Guiana), Languedoc (Lengadòc), Angoumois (eastern end), Limousin (Lemosin), Poitou (Poetou) (southeastern extremity), La Marche (la Marcha), Provence (Provença), Comtat Venaissin (lo Comtat Venaicin), Velay, Vivarais (Vivarés).
Traditional Occitan Provinces (currently in France):
# Béarn [Bearn] (Pau) – 6,800 km2 (est.)
# Guyenne [Guiana] &amp; Gascony (Bordeaux) – 69,400 km2 (est.)
# Limousin [Lemosin] (Limoges) – 9,700 km2 (est.)
# La Marche (Limousin) [la Marcha] (Guéret) – 7,600 km2 (est.)
# Auvergne [Auvèrnhe] (Riom) – 19,300 km2 (est.)
# Languedoc [Lengadòc] (Toulouse) – 45,300 km2 (est.)
# Dauphiné (Grenoble) – 8,500 km2 (est.)
# County of Nice [County of Nissa] (Nice) – 3,600 km2 (est.)
# Provence [Provença] (Aix-en-Provence) – 22,700 km2 (est.)
# Comtat Venaissin [lo Comtat Venaicin] (Carpentras) – 3,600 km2 (est.)
# County of Foix [County of Fois] (Foix) – 3,300 km2 (est.)
X. Bourbonnais (southern half) – approx. 3,200 km2 (est.)

===Administrative divisions in France===

The administrative regions covering Occitania are the following: Occitanie region (except the Pyrénées-Orientales where a majority speak Catalan, although the Fenouillèdes region, in the North-West of the department, that is to say of Occitan language and culture), Nouvelle-Aquitaine (except the peripheries where one speaks basque, poitevin and saintongeais), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (in the southern half, namely almost all the Drôme and the Ardèche, the southern Isère and some fringes of the Loire) and Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. In the Centre-Val de Loire Occitan is spoken in some communes in southern Cher and Indre.

===Geographical boundaries===
The geographical delimitation of Occitania most commonly accepted was specified between 1876—beginning of research on the linguistic boundaries—and the 20th century. Occitania roughly covers a southern third of France (commonly known as &quot;Midi&quot;, including Monaco), the Occitan Valleys and Guardia Piemontese, in Italy, as well as the Val d&#x27;Aran, in Spain.

The practice of Occitan is not the same uniformly throughout the territory. In addition, there is a linguistic transition area in the north called Croissant where the terms of d&#x27;oil and Occitan interfere strongly (see Croissant). Instead, some territories are not generally considered to be part of Occitania according to the modern definition:
* Several zones were dissocialized more or less precociously such as the Poitou, then the Charentes, the Gabay Country and the Petite Gavacherie (replacement by d&#x27;oil speakers after the Hundred Years&#x27; War), intermediate areas with the Franco-Provençal language in the Rhône-Alpes, the lower valleys of the Alps competed with the Piedmontese and Ligurian (Italy).
* The area &quot;charnègue&quot; (&quot;métis&quot; in Gascon) is influenced by the Basque Country because several Gascon communes were part of the former province essentially Basque Labourd and are now located in the west of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department: Bidache, Guiche, Came, Urt, Bassussarry, Montory, Mouguerre. It is a region where both Basque and Occitan Gascon cultures coexist for a long time, just like the families of mixed marriages.
* In several regions of the world we meet historical speakers of Occitan. These areas are not considered Occitan, with the exception of Guardia Piemontese which is a linguistic enclave in southern Italy.
* The zone of the royasc speech is generally excluded from Occitan despite the requests of its speakers who allowed to classify it as Occitan in Italy. This allows its speakers to benefit from the effects of the 482/1999 law on historical minorities, from which North-Italian dialects are excluded. In the past, and particularly shortly after the cession of Brigue and Tende to France, in 1947, was defended the more or less exclusive attribution of the royasc and the brigasc to the system of vivaro-alpine dialects, while more recently, linguists specialized in the field recognize the prevalence of Ligurian phonetic, lexical and morphologic traits (Werner Forner, Jean-Philippe Dalbera and Giulia Petracco Sicardi The Brigasc is a variant of the Royasc with addition of Occitan traits.

==History==

Written texts in Occitan appeared in the 10th century: it was first used in legal texts, and then in literary, scientific, and religious texts. Spoken dialects of Occitan are many centuries older and appeared as soon as the 8th century, at least, as revealed through toponyms and Occitanized words left in Latin manuscripts.
Occitania was often politically united during the Early Middle Ages, under the Visigothic Kingdom and several Merovingian and Carolingian sovereigns. In the year 805 in Thionville, Charlemagne declared the partition of his empire into three autonomous territories along linguistic and cultural boundaries: what is now modern Occitania was to be formed from the reunion of a broader Provence and Aquitaine. Instead, however, at the 9th century division of the Frankish Empire, Occitania was split into different counties, duchies and kingdoms, bishops and abbots. Since then, the country has never been politically united, although Occitania remained intact through a common culture. Nonetheless, Occitania suffered a tangle of varying loyalties to nominal sovereigns: from the 9th to the 13th centuries, the dukes of Aquitaine, the counts of Foix, the counts of Toulouse and the Counts of Barcelona competed for control over the various &quot;pays&quot; of Occitania.

Occitan literature flourished during this time period: in the 12th and 13th centuries, the troubadours invented courtly love (&quot;fin&#x27;amor&quot;), and the &quot;Lenga d&#x27;Òc&quot; spread throughout European cultivated circles; the terms &quot;Lenga d&#x27;Òc&quot;, &quot;Occitan&quot;, and &quot;Occitania&quot; first appeared at the end of the 13th century.

From the 13th to the 17th centuries, the kings of France gradually conquered Occitania. By the end of the 15th century, the nobility and bourgeoisie had started learning French, while the peasantry generally continued to speak Occitan; this process began from the 13th century in the two northernmost regions, northern Limousin and Bourbonnais. In 1539, Francis I issued the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts that imposed the use of French in administration. But despite measures such as this, a strong feeling of national identity against the French occupiers remained as Jean Racine wrote on a trip to Uzès in 1662: &quot;What they call France here is the land beyond the Loire, which to them is a foreign country.&quot;

In 1789, the revolutionary committees tried to re-establish the autonomy of the &quot;Midi&quot; regions, using the Occitan language; however, Jacobin power prevented its realization.

The 19th century witnessed a strong revival of the Occitan literature, exemplified by the writer Frédéric Mistral, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1904. But from 1881 onwards, children who spoke Occitan at school were punished in accordance with minister Jules Ferry&#x27;s recommendations; this led to a deprecation of the language known as &quot;la vergonha&quot; (the shaming). In 1914, fourteen million inhabitants in the region spoke Occitan, but French overtook Occitan in prominence during the 20th century. The situation got worse with the media excluding the use of the &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot;. In spite of this decline, however, the Occitan language is still alive and gaining fresh impetus.

==Outer settlements==

Although not really a colony in a modern sense, there was an Occitan enclave in the County of Tripoli, founded in 1102 by Raymond IV of Toulouse during the Crusades north of Jerusalem. Most people in this county came from Occitania and Italy.

Around the 14th century, some &quot;Provençal&quot; settlements were founded by Valdenses in S
southern Italy: the Capitanata area, Basilicata, and Calabria. Most of them were destroyed by the Inquisition during the 16th century, but the Guardia Piemontese managed to keep its language and Occitan identity until now.

At the end of the 17th century, Valdenses fleeing persecution in the Occitan valleys settled in Baden, Hesse, and Wurtemberg (modern Germany). The use of the Occitan language vanished during the 20th century, but some Occitan placenames are still in use.

In the 19th century, Occitans settled in the Americas. Some Valdense colonies have retained their use of the language down to the present day, such as those in Uruguay and the United States.

==Cultural and political movements==
===Occitanist associations or organizations===
The oldest Occitanist association is the Felibritge, founded in 1854. In 1945, after the Second World War, some of the association&#x27;s members founded a distinct movement, the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Occitans (Institute of Occitan Studies).

The main movements in France are as follows:
* Felibritge historical Mistralian, literary and linguistic movement.
* Institut d&#x27;Estudis Occitans (IEO), maintenance and development of the Occitan language and culture as a whole.
* Calandreta, private associations of Occitan schools of private status
* Several associations or organizations are grouped around the Felibritge, the IEO and the Calendretas.
* Conselh de la Lenga Occitana (CLO), scientific organization of codification of Occitan in the classical norm.
* Federacion dels Ensenhaires de Lenga e Cultura d&#x27;Òc (FELCO), set of teachers and parents of students related to the teaching of Occitan in the public sector.
* Parlaren mistral movement in Provence.
* Academy of arts, letters and sciences of Languedoc
* Marpoc Law 1901 association: Occitan course, Occitan summer university, an Occitan café, colloquiums, conferences, shows and concerts, painting and publishing exhibitions of the &quot;Mar e Mont&quot; collection.
* Òc-Bi, an association of parents of schoolchildren for public bilingual education.
* Centre de Formacion Professionala d&#x27;Occitània-Miègjorn-Pirenèus, a professional organization dedicated to the transmission of the Occitan language and culture to adults.
* Collègi d&#x27;Occitania founded in 1927, teaching the Occitan language and culture.
* Centre Interregional de Desvolopament de l&#x27;Occitan, collaborative digital media library around Occitan culture and language.
* COMDT - Occitan Center for Traditional Music and Dance: a resource center for Occitan culture of oral tradition, transmission and dissemination of traditional music and dance.
* Collectiu Dètz, audiovisual professionals around the Occitan language and culture.
* CORDAE/La Talvera, Occitan center for research, documentation and ethnographic animation.
* Institut Occitan Aquitània, Regional Operator for the Occitan language and culture.

In Italy, the main movements are:

====Anti-Occitanist Associations====

Some associations adhering to Felibritge and Parlaren claim a Provençal language distinct from Occitan.

Other associations claim distinct &quot;languages d&#x27;oc&quot;, even if, paradoxically, some of them are grouped together in an Alliance of Oc languages:
* Association advocating a distinct Auvergne identity: Cercle Terre d&#x27;Auvergne.
* Association advocating a distinct Béarnaise and Gascon language: Institut Béarnais et Gascon.
* Association advocating a distinct Cevenol language: Lou Clu en Ceveno.
* Associations advocating a distinct Provençal language: the Unioun Prouvençalo and its equivalent for Italy Unioun Prouvençalo Transaupino, the Collectif Prouvènço and its Italian equivalent Consulta provenzale.

Some associations have no affiliation with other oc countries:
* Association advocating a distinct Niçoise language: Acadèmia Nissarda.
* Associations advocating a distinct Provençal language: the Astrado Prouvençalo.

====Pan-Occitanist associations====
On the other hand, some groups claim an Occitan-Roman identity including the Catalan Countries (France-Spain).
* Groups actively participating in Eurocongress 2000: Occitan-Catalan Federation, Occitan-Catalan Fundation, Occitan-Catalan Circle of Twinning, Euroccat Association, Espaci Occitan Association.
* Other groups: Oc Valéncia &quot;Centre Internacional de Recerca i Documentació Científica&quot;.

===Politics===
====Spain====
In Spain, Aranese political parties alternately run the Conselh Generau d&#x27;Aran, the principal institution of government in the Val d&#x27;Aran. They also have elected officials in the municipalities of Aran, the Parliament of Catalonia and the Spanish Senate. They are close to Catalan parties with the exception of the localist party Partit Renovador d&#x27;Arties-Garòs who has, however, made alliances with Unity of Aran. Unity of Aran (UA-PNA) is a social-democratic and regionalist-autonomist party affiliated to Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSOE-PSC), while Aranese Democratic Convergence (CDA-PNA), currently in power, is a centrist and autonomist party linked to the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia. Esquèrra Republicana Occitana (ÈRO) founded in 2008, Left/Social Democracy and Independence, is a local section of Republican Left of Catalonia. Corròp is a citizen movement born in February 2015 that aims to break with the Aranese bipartisanship and is inspired by the Catalan independence movement Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), but with a view to Occitania.

In the 2017 Catalan regional election, the electors of the Val d&#x27;Aran voted mostly for &quot;constitutionalists,&quot; parties which support continued union with Spain.

====France====
In France, Occitan political parties and movements (such as the Occitan Nationalist Party, Occitan Party, Freedom !, ...) have had difficulty winning a large audience and getting officials elected. They had never had elected representatives in national or European institutions, or in general councils. However, in the 2010 French regional elections, the Occitan Party, within the framework of the participation of the federation Regions and Peoples with Solidarity to Europe Écologie, elected representatives to five regional councils: Dàvid Grosclaude in Aquitaine., Guilhem Latrubesse in Midi-Pyrénées, Gustau Aliròl in Auvergne, Anne-Marie Hautant and Hervé Guerrera in Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. The latter was also elected to the city council of Aix-en-Provence and counselor to the Agglomeration Community of Aix Country. The movement Bastir! ran for the first time in the 2014 municipal elections and won 55 seats. The president of the Occitan Party, Gustave Alirol, is currently also president of the &quot;Regions and Peoples with Solidarity&quot; party and vice-president of the &quot;European Free Alliance,&quot; which participates in a group of 50 deputies in the European Parliament.

** Since 2009, it has been inscribed in France in the Europe Écologie list as a participant in Regions and Peoples with Solidarity (RPS).
** European Free Alliance/Democratic Party of the Peoples of Europe (FTA/PDPE): The PÒC is a member of this European party.
** Greens–European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA group): Political group of the European Parliament.
* Unitat d&#x27;Òc: federates political activists from different horizons (PNO, PÒC and independent)
* Bastir!: social movement claiming attachment to Occitania (culture, history, environment ...)
====Italy====

* &quot;Movimento Autonomista Occitano&quot; (MAO): branch of the Party of the Occitan Nation in the Italian Occitan Piedmont. Only their newspaper &quot;Ousitanio Vivo&quot; continues to appear.

====Monaco====

There are currently no Occitan political movements in Monaco.

====Former movements====
Former political movements include:
* &quot;Anaram Au Patac&quot;: far left, participated in the CRÒC
* &quot;Occitan Comitat d&#x27;Estudis e d&#x27;Accion&quot; (COEA): Leftist autonomist. It was created in 1965.

==Today==

There are 14 to 16 million inhabitants in Occitania today. According to the 1999 census, there are 610,000 native speakers and another million people with some exposure to the language. Native speakers of Occitan are to be found mostly in the older generations. The Institut d&#x27;Estudis Occitans (IEO) has been modernizing the Occitan language since 1945, and the Conselh de la Lenga Occitana (CLO) since 1996. Nowadays Occitan is used in the most modern musical and literary styles such as rock &#x27;n roll, folk rock (Lou Dalfin), rap (Fabulous Trobadors), reggae (Massilia Sound System) and heavy metal, detective stories or science-fiction. It is represented on the internet. Association schools (&quot;Calandretas&quot;) teach children in Occitan.

The Occitan political movement for self-government has existed since the beginning of the 20th century and particularly since post-war years (Partit Occitan, Partit de la Nacion Occitana, Anaram Au Patac, Iniciativa Per Occitània, Paratge, Bastir! etc.). The movement remains negligible in electoral and political terms. Nevertheless, Regional Elections in 2010 allowed the Partit Occitan to enter the Regional councils of Aquitaine, Auvergne, Midi-Pyrénées, and Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur.

Major demonstrations in Carcassonne (2005 and 2009) and Béziers (2007) and the week-long &quot;Estivada&quot; festivals in Rodez (2006–2010) suggest that there is a revival of Occitan language and culture. However, in France, Occitan is still not recognized as an official language, as the status of French has been constitutionally protected since 1992, and Occitan activists want the French government to adopt Occitan as the second official language for seven regions representing the South of France. 

==Language==
The Occitan language is only recognized as official, protected and promoted in the Val d&#x27;Aran (in Spain); in Italy it has the status of a protected language; and in France it only has acceptance in the educational network but without legal recognition.

The &quot;Fédération des langues régionales pour l&#x27;enseignement public&quot; calculated the number of students in the Occitan language in October 2005 at 4,326.

According to a 2002 report by the French Ministry of Culture (&quot;Report to Parliament on the use of the French language&quot;, 2003), in public schools, &quot;collèges&quot; and &quot;lycées&quot; and private schools: in the academic year 2001–02, 67,549 students had enrolled in classes of or in Occitan.

Despite this precarious social position, Occitan was one of the official languages of the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics.

==Culture==

==Literature==
* The &quot;troubadour&quot; school first marked the emergence of a distinct Occitan culture during the High Middle Ages. The troubadours were highly appreciated for their refined lyricism and influenced many other similar &quot;schools&quot; throughout Europe. &quot;Troubadourism&quot; (the later shorthand) remained a tradition for centuries and its members were mainly from the aristocracy; the movement was epitomized by William IX, Duke of Aquitaine and Bertran de Born.
* Occitan literature experienced a rebirth during the Baroque period, mainly in Gascony through the Béarnese dialect. Indeed, Béarnese was the mother-tongue Henry IV of France, whose designation sparked a relative enthusiasm for Béarnese literature with the publication of works by Pey de Garros and Arnaud de Salette. Toulouse was also an important place for this &quot;renaissença&quot;, especially through the poems of Pèire Godolin. Nonetheless, Occitan literature following the death of Henry IV went into a significant period of decline, as witnessed by the fact that local poets, such as Clément Marot, began to write in French.
* Frédéric Mistral and his Félibrige school marked the renewal of the Occitan language in literature in the middle of the 19th century. Mistral won the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature, illustrating the curiosity about the Provençal dialect (which was considered an exotic language) in France and in Europe at that time, with his Irish friend and colleague, the poet William Bonaparte-Wyse, choosing Provençal as his own language of composition.
* L&#x27;Acadèmia dels Jòcs Florals (The Academy of the Floral Games), held every year in Toulouse, is considered one of the oldest literary institution in the Western world (founded in 1323). Its main purpose is to promote Occitan poetry.
* In 1945 the cultural association &quot;L&#x27;Institut d&#x27;Estudis Occitans&quot; (The Institute of Occitan Studies) was created by a group of Occitan and French writers, including Jean Cassou, Tristan Tzara and Renat Nelli. Its purpose is to maintain and develop the language and influence of Occitania, mainly through the promotion of local literature and poetry.

==Music==
Romantic composer Gabriel Fauré was born in Pamiers, Ariège in the Pyrenees region of France. Déodat de Séverac, another Romantic music composer, was also born in the region, and, following his schooling in Paris, he returned to Occitania to compose; he sought to incorporate the music indigenous to the area into his compositions.

==Cuisine==

Occitan cuisine is considered Mediterranean, but has some specific features that separate it from Catalan cuisine or Italian cuisine. Indeed, because of the size of Occitania and the great diversity of landscapes- from the mountaineering of the Pyrenees and the Alps, rivers and lakes, and finally the Mediterranean and Atlantic coast – it can be considered as a highly varied cuisine. Compared to other Mediterranean cuisines, Occitan gastronomy significantly uses basic elements and flavors, such as meat, fish and vegetables, along with the frequent usage of olive oil; elements from Atlantic coast cuisine are also common, such as cheeses, pastes, creams, butters and other high-calorie foods. Well-renowned meals common on the Mediterranean coast include ratatolha (the equivalent of Catalan &quot;samfaina&quot;), alhòli, bolhabaissa (similar to Italian &quot;Brodetto alla Vastese&quot;), pan golçat (bread with olive oil), and salads with mainly olives, rice, corn and wine. Another significant aspect that distinguishes Occitan cuisine from that of its Mediterranean neighbors is the abundant amount of aromatic herbs; some of them are typically Mediterranean, like parsley, rosemary, thyme, oregano or again basil.

Some world-renowned traditional meals are Provençal &quot;ratatolha&quot; (ratatouille), &quot;alhòli&quot; (aioli) and &quot;adauba&quot; (Provençal stew), Niçard &quot;salada nissarda&quot; (Salad Niçoise) and &quot;pan banhat&quot; (Pan-bagnat), Limousin &quot;clafotís&quot; (clafoutis), Auvergnat &quot;aligòt&quot; (aligot), Languedocien &quot;caçolet&quot; (cassoulet), or again Gascon &quot;fetge gras&quot; (foie gras).

Occitania is also home of a great variety of cheeses (like Roquefort, Bleu d&#x27;Auvergne, Cabécou, Cantal, Fourme d&#x27;Ambert, Laguiole, Pélardon, Saint-Nectaire, Salers), and a great diversity of wines (such as Bordeaux, Rhône wine, Gaillac wine, Saint-Émilion wine, Blanquette de Limoux, Muscat de Rivesaltes, Provence wine, Cahors wine, Jurançon). Alcohols such as Pastis and Marie Brizard or brandies such as Armagnac and Cognac are also produced in the area.

<text>James MacKerras Macdonnell, (15 December 1884 – 27 July 1973) was a Canadian lawyer and parliamentarian.

==Biography==
He was born in Kingston, Ontario, the son of George W. Macdonnell and Mary Louise Philips, he was a Master at St. Andrew&#x27;s College from 1904 to 1914 before becoming a trust company officer. He enlisted with the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 24 September 1914 at Valcartier, Quebec. He was awarded an MC in the 1917 Birthday Honours.

==Career==
Macdonnell was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative Party candidate in the 1945 federal election representing Muskoka—Ontario riding. He was defeated in the 1949 federal election, but returned to parliament later that year when he won a by-election held in the Toronto riding of Greenwood.

Following the 1957 federal election that returned the first Progressive Conservative government and the first Tory government since the Great Depression, the new Prime Minister of Canada, John Diefenbaker, named Macdonnell to Cabinet as a minister without portfolio. He resigned from Cabinet on 8 August 1959 for health reasons and was defeated in the 1962 federal election by Andrew Brewin of the New Democratic Party.

Macdonnell was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1967 for &quot;services as a parliamentarian&quot;.

<text>&quot;Movin&#x27; Out (Anthony&#x27;s Song)&quot; is a song written and recorded by Billy Joel, featured on his 1977 album &quot;The Stranger&quot; as the opening track. 

The song critiques the ambitions of working- and lower-middle-class New Yorkers who strive for material success as evidence of social mobility, working long hours to afford the outward signs of having &quot;made it&quot;. Joel describes characters with blue-collar occupations attempting to distance themselves from their working class roots by acquiring status symbols, such as upgrading from a Chevy to a Cadillac or purchasing a home in Hackensack, New Jersey. He implies these efforts are ultimately futile. According to Joel, Anthony is not a real person, but rather &quot;every Irish, Polish, and Italian kid trying to make a living in the US&quot;.

The recording concludes with the sound effect of a car, bass player Doug Stegmeyer&#x27;s 1960s Corvette, starting and driving away, symbolizing departure.

Live performances of the song can be heard on &quot;2000 Years: The Millennium Concert&quot; and &quot;12 Gardens Live&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; as an &quot;upbeat narrative that is sort of a commentary on upward mobility.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;growling cellos and a pulsating rhythm section set the mood for Joel&#x27;s threatening indictment of middle-class values&quot; and that it has &quot;one of the best choruses he has written in some time, combined with unusual echo effects, a yapping horn section, and a melodic guitar finale that wraps it all up nicely.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said it is &quot;a typically expressive Joel song, with New York City references and an unusual, piano-dominated structure.&quot;

==Versions==
The 45RPM single slightly differs from the album version as the sound effects of the car near the end of the song were removed. The single was originally released in Autumn of 1977, but was pulled when Joel&#x27;s previous single started climbing the charts. It was re-released in March 1978.

==Personnel==
*Billy Joel – lead and backing vocals, piano
*Steve Khan and Hiram Bullock – electric guitars
*Richie Cannata – saxophones
*Doug Stegmeyer – bass guitar
*Liberty DeVitto – drums

==Broadway musical==

The Twyla Tharp Broadway dance musical &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;, featuring the songs of Billy Joel, opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City on October 24, 2002, and played 1,307 performances before closing in December 2005. The show&#x27;s lead piano player and singer was Michael Cavanaugh. It toured the US extensively from 2004 to 2007, with Darren Holden as lead Piano Man, and Matt Wilson, James Fox and Matthew Friedman as second Piano Men. The show transferred to the Apollo Victoria Theatre in the West End of London on April 10, 2006; James Fox played lead piano and sang, with Darren Reeves as second piano man. It closed early, on May 22, owing to poor ticket sales.

&quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot; is also the title of the original Broadway cast album taken from the musical.

<text>Stanley Fischer (; born October 15, 1943) is an Israeli-American economist who served as the 20th vice chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2017. Fischer previously served as the 8th governor of the Bank of Israel from 2005 to 2013. Born in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), he holds dual citizenship in Israel and the United States. He previously served as First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and as Chief Economist of the World Bank. On January 10, 2014, President Barack Obama nominated Fischer to the position of Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve. He is a senior advisor at BlackRock. On September 6, 2017, Stanley Fischer announced that he was resigning as Vice-Chair for personal reasons effective October 13, 2017.

==Biography==
Stanley Fischer was born into a Jewish family in Mazabuka, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). When he was 13, his family moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where he became an active member of Habonim, a Labor Zionist youth movement. In 1960, he visited Israel as part of a winter program for youth leaders, and studied Hebrew at kibbutz Ma&#x27;agan Michael. He had originally planned to study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, but instead accepted a scholarship to attend the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom, where he received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in economics between 1962 and 1966. Fischer then went on to graduate study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a Ph.D. in economics in 1969 with a thesis titled &quot;Essays on Assets and Contingent Commodities&quot;, written under the supervision of Franklin M. Fisher. He became a naturalised citizen of the United States in 1976.

Fischer was married to Rhoda Fischer (née Keet), whom he met during his days in Habonim; the couple had three children. When they moved to Israel, Rhoda became honorary president of Aleh Negev, a rehabilitation village for the disabled. Rhoda Fischer passed away in 2020.

==Academic career==
In the early 1970s, Fischer was an associate professor at the University of Chicago. He was a professor at the Department of Economics at MIT from 1977 to 1988.

In 1977, Fischer wrote the paper &quot;Long-Term Contracts, Rational Expectations, and the Optimal Money Supply Rule&quot;, where he combined the idea of rational expectations argued by new classical economists such as Robert Lucas with the idea that price stickiness still led to some degree of market shortcomings, and so argued that an active monetary policy could help mitigate problems in times of economic downturn. The paper made Fischer a central figure in New Keynesian economics. Through this critique of new classical macroeconomics, Fischer contributed significantly to clarifying the limits of the policy-ineffectiveness proposition.

He authored three popular economics textbooks, &quot;Macroeconomics&quot; (with Rüdiger Dornbusch and Richard Startz), &quot;Lectures on Macroeconomics&quot; (with Olivier Blanchard), and the introductory &quot;Economics&quot;, with David Begg and Rüdiger Dornbusch. He also mentored and helped advise the Ph.D. theses authored by economists Ben Bernanke, Mario Draghi, and Greg Mankiw.

In 2012, Fischer served as Humanitas Visiting Professor in Economic Thought at the University of Oxford.

==Public policy and banking career==
From January 1988 to August 1990 he served as Chief Economist of the World Bank. He was then appointed First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, and served in that role from September 1994 to August 2001. By the end of 2001, Fischer had joined the Group of Thirty, an influential Washington-based financial advisory body. From February 2002 to April 2005, after leaving the IMF, he was an executive at Citigroup, where he served as Vice Chairman, President of Citigroup International, and Head of the Public Sector Client Group.

===Bank of Israel===
Fischer was appointed Governor of the Bank of Israel in January 2005 by the Israeli cabinet, after being recommended by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He had been involved in the past with the Bank of Israel; he had helped implement Israel’s 1985 Economic Stabilization Plan as an American government adviser. He took the position on May 1, 2005, replacing David Klein (who ended his term on January 16, 2005), and was sworn in for a second term on May 2, 2010. Fischer became an Israeli citizen, but did not renounce U.S. citizenship.

Under his management, in 2010, the Bank of Israel was ranked first among central banks for its efficient functioning, according to IMD&#x27;s World Competitiveness Yearbook.

Fischer was widely praised for his handling of the Israeli economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; in September 2009, the Bank of Israel was the first bank in the developed world to raise interest rates.

In 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 Fischer received an &quot;A&quot; rating on the Central Banker Report Card published by &quot;Global Finance&quot; magazine.

In June 2011, Fischer applied for the post of IMF managing director to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but was barred, as the IMF stipulates that a new managing director must be no older than 65, and he was 67 at the time.

On June 30, 2013, Fischer stepped down as Governor of the Bank of Israel halfway through his second term, despite high popularity.

===U.S. Federal Reserve===
American President Barack Obama nominated Fischer to the position of Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, the United States&#x27; central bank, in January 2014. In nominating Fischer for the position, Obama stated he brought &quot;decades of leadership and expertise from various roles, including serving at the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of Israel.&quot;

On May 21, 2014, the Senate confirmed Fischer&#x27;s appointment to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In a separate vote on June 12, he was confirmed as the vice chair. Fischer succeeded Janet Yellen as vice chair; Yellen had become Chair of the Federal Reserve earlier in 2014. Fischer resigned for personal reasons in mid-October, 2017, 8 months before the expiry in June 2018 of his term as vice chair.

== Awards and recognition ==
Fischer received an honorary doctorate from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006. In October 2010, Fischer was declared Central Bank Governor of the Year by &quot;Euromoney&quot; magazine.

He is a member of the Bilderberg Group and attended its conferences in 1996, 1998 and 1999. He also appears to have attended the Bilderberg Group’s conference in 2011 in St. Moritz, Switzerland, though (as of March 2016) his name does not show up on the list of participants for the year 2011. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations. Fischer was named a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association in 2013. He is also a member of the Inter-American Dialogue.

<doc id="1149382" wikidata="Q32897" url="?curid=1149382" title="Banu Thaqif">
<text>The Banu Thaqif () is an Arab tribe which inhabited, and still inhabits, the city of Ta&#x27;if and its environs, in modern Saudi Arabia, and played a prominent role in early Islamic history. 

During the pre-Islamic period, the Thaqif rivaled and cooperated with the Quraysh tribe of Mecca in trade and land ownership. The tribe initially opposed the Islamic prophet Muhammad, but following the Muslim siege of Ta&#x27;if in 630, they came to terms and embraced Islam. The Thaqif&#x27;s inter-tribal networks and their relatively high education helped them quickly advance in the nascent Muslim state. They took on an especially important role in the conquest and administration of Iraq, providing the Rashidun and Umayyad caliphs capable and powerful governors for that province and the eastern Caliphate. 

Among their notable governors in Iraq were al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba (638, 642–645), Ziyad ibn Abihi (665–673), and al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (694–714), while major Thaqafite commanders included Uthman ibn Abi al-As, who led the first Muslim naval expeditions in the 630s, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, the conqueror of Sind in the 710s, and pro-Alid revolutionary Al-Mukhtar Ibn Abi Ubayd.

==Origins==
The Thaqif is a branch of the Hawazin, a major tribal grouping of the Qays, but is often counted separately from the Hawazin in the traditional Arabic sources. According to Arab genealogical tradition, the progenitor of the Thaqif was Qasi ibn Munabbih ibn Bakr ibn Hawazin, whose epithet was &#x27;Thaqif&#x27;. This supposed genealogy made them &#x27;nephews&#x27; of the Banu Sa&#x27;d and cousins of the Banu Nasr and Banu Amir.

The Thaqif may have adopted their descent from Hawazin to secure an alliance with the nomadic Hawazin tribe of Banu Amir. Before this, when the Thaqif lived in the outskirts of Ta&#x27;if, the tribe claimed lineage from the Iyad. When the Banu Amir drove out Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s dominant tribe, the Adwan, the Thaqif proposed to settle in the city and cultivate its lands under the Banu Amir&#x27;s protection, in exchange for giving the latter half of the crop. While this narrative could be related to polemics against the tribe, such as another account which claims the Thaqif descended from Thamud, the historian Michael Lecker suggests it may reflect an actual phase in the tribe&#x27;s history.

Unlike its nomadic Hawazin counterparts, the Thaqif was a settled, or &#x27;urban&#x27;, tribe from the pre-Islamic period, living in the city of Ta&#x27;if, which they built a wall around. The tribe benefited from hosting the pilgrims visiting the idol of al-Lat housed in the city, as well as the pilgrims passing through on their way to the nearby sanctuary town of Mecca. The tribe prospered from cultivating Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s orchards and agricultural lands, and from the caravan trade. The Thaqif cooperated and competed with the Quraysh of Mecca in both agriculture and trade, the two tribes often participating in joint caravans while also competing for ownership of Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s agricultural estates. Before and after the advent of Islam in , the Thaqif and Quraysh, especially the latter&#x27;s influential Umayyad house, forged considerable marital ties.

==Branches==
The Thaqif was divided into two sections: the more prestigious Banu Malik or Banu Hutayt, which consisted of the Malik ibn Hutayt clan of the Jusham branch, and the Ahlaf (&#x27;Allies&#x27;), which consisted of the rest of the Jusham branch and all of the Awf branch. Though there were often clashes between the two sides, by the eve of the Muslim capture of Ta&#x27;if in 630 the two sides were on relatively equal footing in their control of Ta&#x27;if.

==Early Muslim period==
===Relations with Muhammad===
The Thaqif contributed some men to the Quraysh against Muhammad during the Battle of Badr in 624. After Muhammad captured Mecca and gained the submission of the Quraysh, his emergent Muslim polity came under threat by the Thaqif in Ta&#x27;if and the tribe&#x27;s nomadic Hawazin confederates. They viewed with alarm the greatly boosted position of Muhammad, now with their chief rival, the Quraysh, behind him. Muhammad moved to subdue the Thaqif and Hawazin in the ensuing Battle of Hunayn. The Thaqif–Hawazin coalition under Malik ibn Awf al-Nasri gained an early advantage but the tide turned and the Muslims routed the coalition, taking thousands of Hawazin women and children captive and considerable booty. The Muslims proceeded to besiege Ta&#x27;if, where many of the Bedouin warriors of the Hawazin took refuge. Many of the Qurayshites in the Muslim army were motivated to prevent the Thaqafites from capturing their estates near Ta&#x27;if. When the siege faltered, Muhammad succeeded in turning Malik ibn Awf and his Bedouin warriors against the Thaqif and they blockaded the roads leading into Ta&#x27;if.

The siege compelled the Thaqif to send a delegation led by one of their chiefs, Abd Yalil, to Muhammad to negotiate their conversion to Islam. After the submission of the Thaqif, its idols in Ta&#x27;if were destroyed and the tribe lost the religious prestige it previously held as the idols&#x27; guardians. Despite their defeat, the Thaqif became firmly incorporated into the Muslim community and, in the words of the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, Muhammad had &quot;secured the allegiance and services&quot; of another &quot;able and experienced group&quot; as he had done with the Quraysh. As with the latter, the Thaqafites marshaled their political know-how and tribal contacts in service of the Muslim state as its formed and expanded its territory.

===Role in the conquest of Iraq===
Among the Thaqafite delegates to Muhammad was Uthman ibn Abi al-As of the Banu Malik, who Muhammad appointed as his (agent, governor, or tax collector) over the Thaqif. When most of the Arab tribes discarded the authority of the Muslim state following Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632, in what became known as the Ridda wars, Uthman played an important role in preventing the Thaqif from similarly defecting. With the Ridda wars&#x27; conclusion in 633, Uthman and several Thaqafis played command roles in the early Muslim conquests and occupied prominent roles in the emergent Caliphate, especially in the wealthy region of Iraq. The Quraysh paid less attention to Sasanian Iraq than to Byzantine Syria in the leadup to the conquests of those two regions in the mid-to-late 630s. As the Muslim war efforts in Iraq began to intensify, the Thaqafites, as well as the Ansar natives of Medina, played the leadership roles and contributed significant numbers of men there, along with the nomadic tribes who lived near the region, such as the Banu Tamim and the Banu Bakr. Caliph Umar appointed the Thaqafite Abu Ubayd ibn Mas&#x27;ud as the conquest&#x27;s overall commander in 634, but he was slain during the Battle of the Bridge, where the Sasanians defeated the Muslims.

While the overall command in Iraq eventually passed to the Qurayshite companion of Muhammad, Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, the Thaqafites played the central role in the front that was opened in southern Iraq, around the port of al-Ubulla, and neighboring Khuzistan. The commander there, Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini, was married into the Thaqif, and his successor was the Thaqafite companion of Muhammad, al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba. These Thaqafites founded Basra, the chief garrison city of the Muslim Arabs in southern Iraq, in and continued to be prominent in the city through later decades. 

===Administration of Iraq and the east===
The literacy of the Thaqif in the pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods was on par with the Quraysh, and was a key factor in the Muslim state&#x27;s recruitment of Thaqafite tribesmen to important administrative positions. Al-Mughira founded the tax administration in Basra, and was later appointed governor of Kufa in 642, remaining in the post until he was dismissed in 645. Knowledgeable in Persian, the language of the bureaucracy in Iraq, and having gained considerable experience among the Arab tribal soldiery who settled in Iraq, he was reappointed by Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I () as governor of Kufa in 661 and held office until his death in 671. 

Through al-Mughira&#x27;s good offices with the caliph, he secured the pardon of his protege, the adoptive Thaqafite Ziyad ibn Abihi, in 664. Ziyad had been educated by al-Mughira&#x27;s cousin, Jubayr ibn Hayya ibn Mas&#x27;ud ibn Mu&#x27;attib, who served a secretarial position in the Iraqi administration. Ziyad became the powerful governor of Basra in 665, and after al-Mughira&#x27;s death, was assigned the governorship of Kufa as well, making him the viceroy of Iraq and the eastern Caliphate. He enacted major reforms to Iraq&#x27;s military organization and restarted the Muslim conquests into Central Asia. After his death in 673, he was succeeded by his son Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, while several more of his sons gained deputy governorships and important commands. Their education, experience with Iraqi affairs, and close ties with the Quraysh, particularly its Umayyad house, well-positioned the Thaqafites to administer Iraq and its eastern dependencies under the Umayyad caliphs. According to Kennedy, Mu&#x27;awiya contracted the governance of Iraq and the east &quot;to what must have been seen as a Thaqafi mafia&quot;.

The Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik () appointed the Thaqafite al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf over Iraq and the east in 694. Although coming from Ta&#x27;if, al-Hajjaj benefited from his tribal ties with the Thaqif of Iraq. Like the other Thaqafites who administered Iraq, al-Hajjaj had been a man of letters, in his case, working as a teacher before taking up a military career. He married several Qurayshite women, including an Umayyad, while his niece, the daughter of Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, married the Umayyad caliph Yazid II () and was the mother of his son, Caliph al-Walid II (). Al-Hajjaj generally was not tribally partisan in his administrative and military appointments, but nevertheless paid special favor to his Thaqafite kinsmen. He appointed three of al-Mughira&#x27;s sons, his brother Muhammad, and several other family members as district governors, while commissioning his capable nephew, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, as the conqueror and governor of Sind.

==Modern==
During his travels to Arabia, including Ta&#x27;if, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt noted that the Thaqif remained &quot;a very powerful tribe&quot; which controlled most of Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s gardens and agricultural lands, as well as elsewhere along the eastern ridges of the Hejaz mountains. They constituted half of Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s inhabitants at that time, while part of the tribe lived as Bedouins outside of the city where they possessed large herds of goats and sheep. Militarily, they lacked horses and camels, but could mobilize some two thousand riflemen equipped with matchlocks. In the present day, members of the Thaqif, both settled and nomadic, continue to reside in Ta&#x27;if.

<text>Choliambic verse (), also known as limping iambs or scazons or halting iambic, is a form of meter in poetry. It is found in both Greek and Latin poetry in the classical period. Choliambic verse is sometimes called &quot;scazon&quot;, or &quot;lame iambic&quot;, because it brings the reader down on the wrong &quot;foot&quot; by reversing the stresses of the last few beats. It was originally pioneered by the Greek lyric poet Hipponax, who wrote &quot;lame trochaics&quot; as well as &quot;lame iambics&quot;.

The basic structure is much like iambic trimeter, except that the last cretic is made heavy by the insertion of a longum instead of a breve. Also, the third anceps of the iambic trimeter line must be short in limping iambs. In other words, the line scans as follows (where — is a long syllable, ⏑ is a short syllable, and × is an anceps):

As in all classical verse forms, the phenomenon of brevis in longo is observed, so the last syllable can actually be short or long.

==Latin==

The Roman poet Catullus&#x27; , and serve as examples of choliambic verse.
:
:
: (Catullus, 8.1–5)

:&quot;Wretched Catullus, you should stop being foolish,
:and what you see has perished, you should consider it lost.
:Once suns shone brightly for you
:when you used to go wherever your girl led you,
:loved by us as much as no girl will ever be loved.&quot;

Occasionally, one of the first three in the line may be resolved into two short syllables, but this is rare. There is usually a caesura or word-break after either the 5th or the 7th syllable.

In later poets, such as Persius, Martial, and Ausonius, resolution was used more freely, in any of the first four , and sometimes the first foot might be an anapaest (u u –).

<doc id="1149394" wikidata="Q886261" url="?curid=1149394" title="Cauliflower ear">
<text>Cauliflower ear is an irreversible condition that occurs when the external portion of the ear is hit and develops a blood clot or other collection of fluid under the perichondrium. This separates the cartilage from the overlying perichondrium that supplies its nutrients, causing it to die and resulting in the formation of fibrous tissue in the overlying skin. As a result, the outer ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower, hence the name.

The condition is common in wrestling, boxing, and kickboxing, in martial arts such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, sumo, and mixed martial arts, and in full-contact sports such as rugby league or rugby union.

== Presentation==
People presenting with possible auricular hematoma often have additional injuries (for example, head/neck lacerations) due to the frequently traumatic causes of auricular hematoma. The ear itself is often tense, fluctuant, and tender with throbbing pain. However, because of potentially more remarkable injuries often associated with auricular hematoma, auricular hematoma can easily be overlooked without directed attention.

=== Diagnosis ===
Perichondral hematoma and consequently cauliflower ear are diagnosed clinically. This means that the medical provider will make the diagnosis by using elements of the history of the injury (examples: participation in contact sports, trauma to the ear, previous similar episodes) and combine this with findings on physical exam (examples: tenderness to the area, bruising, deformation of the ear contours) to confirm the diagnosis and decide on the appropriate treatment for the patient. 

To assist with settling on the best form of treatment for cauliflower ear, Yotsuyanagi et al. created a classification system for deciding when surgery is needed and as a guide to what the best approach would be.
==Causes==
The most common cause of cauliflower ear is blunt trauma to the ear leading to a hematoma which, if left untreated, eventually heals to give the distinct appearance of cauliflower ear. Participating in contact sports and martial arts is a typical source of such trauma. The structure of the ear is supported by a cartilaginous scaffold consisting of the following distinct components: the helix, antihelix, concha, tragus, and antitragus. The skin that covers this cartilage is extremely thin with virtually no subcutaneous fat while also strongly attached to the perichondrium, which is richly vascularized to supply the avascular cartilage.

Cauliflower ear can also present in the setting of nontraumatic inflammatory injury of auricular connective tissue such as in relapsing polychondritis (RP), a rare rheumatologic disorder in which recurrent episodes of inflammation result in destruction of cartilage of the ears and nose. Joints, eyes, audiovestibular system, cardiovascular system, and respiratory tract can also be involved.

=== Mechanism ===
The components of the ear involved in cauliflower ear are the outer skin, the perichondrium, and the cartilage. The outer ear skin is tightly adherent to the perichondrium because there is almost no subcutaneous fat on the anterior of the ear. This leaves the perichondrium relatively exposed to damage from direct trauma and shear forces, created by a force pushing across the ear like a punch, and increasing the risk of hematoma formation. In an auricular hematoma, blood accumulates between the perichondrium and cartilage. The hematoma mechanically obstructs blood flow from the perichondrium to the avascular cartilage. This lack of perfusion puts the cartilage at risk for becoming necrotic and/or infected. If left untreated, disorganized fibrosis and cartilage formation will occur around the aforementioned cartilaginous components.

Consequently, the concave pinna fills with disorganized connective tissue. The cartilage then deforms and kinks, resulting in the distinctive appearance somewhat resembling a cauliflower. Rapid evacuation of the hematoma restores close contact between the cartilage and perichondrium, thereby reducing the likelihood of deformity by minimizing the ischemia that would otherwise result from a remaining hematoma.

Auricular hematoma most often occurs in the potential space between the helix and the antihelix (scapha) and extends anteriorly into the fossa triangularis. Less frequently, the hematoma may form in the concha or the area in and around the external auditory meatus. Importantly, an auricular hematoma can also occur on the posterior ear surface, or even both surfaces. Risk of necrotic tissue is greatest when both posterior and anterior surfaces are involved, although posterior surface involvement is less likely given its increased quantity of impact-dampening subcutaneous tissue.

== Preventions ==
Headgear called a &quot;scrum cap&quot; in rugby, or simply &quot;headgear&quot; or ear guard in wrestling and other martial arts, that protects the ears is worn to help prevent this condition. A specialty ear splint can also be made to keep the ear compressed, so that the damaged ear is unable to fill thus preventing cauliflower ear. For some athletes, however, a cauliflower ear is considered a badge of courage or experience.

==Treatment==

There are many types of treatment for the perichondral hematoma that can lead to cauliflower ear, but the current body of research is unable to identify a single best treatment or protocol. There is definitive evidence that the drainage of this hematoma is better for the prevention of cauliflower deformity when compared to conservative treatment, but the use of bandages and/or splinting after drainage requires more research.

Because an acute hematoma can lead to cauliflower ear, prompt evacuation of the blood can prevent permanent deformity. There are many described techniques for the drainage of blood in the acute stage to prevent hematoma, including aspiration and drainage, incision and drainage, use of continuous suction devices and placing a wick. After the blood has been drained, the prevention of re-accumulation becomes the most pressing issue. This has been achieved with many techniques including: direct pressure dressings, in and out mattress sutures, buttons placed on sutures, thermoplastic splints, sutured cotton balls, and absorbable mattress sutures. The use of simple drainage becomes less useful after six hours from the injury and when there is recurrent trauma. In these cases it has been suggested that open surgical treatment is more effective in returning the cosmetic appearance and prevention of recurrence. The outer ear is prone to infections, so antibiotics are usually prescribed. Pressure can be applied by bandaging which helps the skin and the cartilage to reconnect. Clothes pegs, magnets, and custom molded ear splints can also be used to ensure adequate pressure is applied to the damaged area Without medical intervention the ear can sustain serious damage. Disruption of the ear canal is possible. The outer ear may wrinkle and can become slightly pale due to reduced blood flow; hence the common term &quot;cauliflower ear&quot;. Cosmetic procedures are available that can possibly improve the appearance of the ear.

==History==

The presentation of cauliflower ear was recorded in ancient Greece.

In 19th-century Hong Kong opium dens, opium users would develop cauliflower ear from long periods sleeping on hard wooden pillows.

<text>The G Brooklyn-Queens Crosstown is an rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it uses the IND Crosstown Line.

The G operates 24 hours a day between Court Square in Long Island City, Queens, and Church Avenue in Kensington, Brooklyn and makes all stops along the full route. It is the only non-shuttle service in the system that does not run within the borough of Manhattan. The G serves two stations in Queens—Court Square and 21st Street, both in Long Island City. Prior to 2010, it served the IND Queens Boulevard Line between Court Square and 71st Avenue in Forest Hills. In 1939 and 1940, the then-designated GG also used the now-demolished IND World&#x27;s Fair Line to access the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The GG, which became the G in 1985, had its southern terminal at Smith–Ninth Streets from 1976 to 2009.

In the 21st century, the G suffered from a wide range of issues that has resulted in complaints by people living along the route. These issues included a dearth of transfers to other services; the lack of direct service to Manhattan; short train lengths; and low frequencies. Since the 2000s, several improvements have been made to the G, including a route extension in Brooklyn and a full-route audit in 2013 that identified solutions for issues on the G service. , additional improvements are planned for the G route, including the automation of the entire route.

==History==

=== Early service ===
The original Brooklyn–Queens Crosstown Local service began on August 19, 1933, as a shuttle between Queens Plaza on the IND Queens Boulevard Line and Nassau Avenue. This service was designated GG because the IND used double letters to indicate local service. Starting on April 24, 1937, GG trains were extended to Forest Hills–71st Avenue during rush hours, serving as the Queens Boulevard local while trains ran express west of 71st Avenue. The entire IND Crosstown Line was completed on July 1, 1937, including the connection to the IND Culver Line (then the South Brooklyn Line) at Bergen Street. Although some retrospective accounts have intimated that GG service initially ran at all times between Forest Hills–71st Avenue and Church Avenue before being truncated, a contemporaneous article from &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Smith–Ninth Streets station served as the GG&#x27;s original Brooklyn terminus.

From April 30 to November 1, 1939, and from May 11 to October 28, 1940, GG trains were extended via the temporary IND World&#x27;s Fair Line to World&#x27;s Fair Station at Horace Harding Boulevard at all times during the 1939–1940 World&#x27;s Fair. Trains were marked as S Special. The fair closed on October 28, 1940, with the station and line being demolished later that year. As a result, GG service was truncated to Forest Hills–71st Avenue. Additional GG service was provided for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, running nonstop between Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station and Roosevelt Avenue every 30 minutes between 10 a.m. and 3:30 pm. It took 23 minutes for trains to travel between the two stations.

===1960s to 1990s===



On August 19, 1968, service was extended to Church Avenue during rush hours to allow for the introduction of express service on the IND Culver Line. Since riders at local stations complained about the loss of direct service to Manhattan, F trains to and from Kings Highway began making local stops. All peak-direction F trains began running local on January 19, 1976. On August 30, 1976, due to budget cuts, remaining F express service north of Church Avenue was eliminated and GG service was cut back to Smith–Ninth Streets. On January 24, 1977, as part of a series of NYCTA service cuts to save $13 million, many subway lines began running shorter trains again during middays. As part of the change, GG trains began running with four cars between 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 pm. On August 27, 1977, GG service was cut back to Queens Plaza during late nights, and local service along Queens Boulevard was provided by the . Effective May 6, 1985, use of double letters to indicate local service was discontinued, so the GG was relabeled G.

Afterwards, as part of the New York City Transit Authority&#x27;s proposed service plan to serve the new Archer Avenue Line upper level, the G would have been extended to Jamaica Center during weekends and evenings when N trains terminated at 71st Avenue or 57th Street–Seventh Avenue. During late nights, a G train shuttle would have run between Jamaica Center and Van Wyck Boulevard. On weekdays, the extension would have been served by N trains. This service plan would have allowed E and F trains to remain on the Queens Boulevard mainline toward 179th Street. The final service plan, which took effect on December 11, 1988, had the extension served by E trains, with R trains extended to 179th Street.

On May 24, 1987, the and services switched terminals in Queens. As part of the reroute plan, Queens Plaza became the northern terminal for the G train on evenings, weekends, and late nights. Three years later, on September 30, 1990, G service was extended to 179th Street during late nights to replace the , which terminated at 36th Street and Fourth Avenue. On April 14, 1991, weekend service was extended from Queens Plaza to 71st Avenue. Weekend G service was cut back to Queens Plaza on July 26, 1992.

In January 1991, F express service was proposed to speed service during the height of rush hours which would have reduced travel time by up to five minutes. Alternate F trains would operate express in both directions between Jay Street and Church Avenue, stopping at Seventh Avenue; as a result of this service change, G trains would be cut back from its southern terminal at Smith–Ninth Streets and originate and terminate at Bergen Street to prevent delays in express service. This service change would have been implemented in October 1991, pending approval from the MTA board. An alternate version was implemented in September 2019 when limited rush hour F trains (designated as a diamond &lt;F&gt;) began running express between Jay Street and Church Avenue, stopping at Seventh Avenue.

=== Recent changes ===

Beginning on March 23, 1997, G trains started terminating at Court Square on weekends. On August 30, 1997, late night service was permanently cut back from 179th Street to Court Square, with the F running local east of Queens Plaza replacing G service, meaning that the G only ran along the Queens Boulevard Line on weekdays. Evening service between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. was cut back from Queens Plaza to Court Square. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Connector opened and Court Square became the northern terminal for the G train during weekdays, while G service was extended to Forest Hills–71st Avenue at all other times, which represented the reverse of the previous pattern. Service along the IND Queens Boulevard Line was replaced by the new train during weekdays. The G was to be truncated to Court Square at all times to make room for the V, but due to rider opposition it was cut back only on weekdays until 8:30 pm. Four G trains in each direction ran to or from Church Avenue. The headway for weekday evening service increased from 12 minutes to 15 minutes, while the headway for rush hour and Saturday morning and afternoon service decreased from 10 minutes to 8 minutes.

On April 27, 2003, Saturday morning and afternoon G service was decreased, with service running every 12 minutes instead of every 8 minutes, and Sunday afternoon service was decreased to run every 12 minutes instead of every 10 minutes. In addition, Saturday morning and afternoon G trains turned out of service at Fourth Avenue instead of Church Avenue.

On July 5, 2009, the G was once again extended south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street—used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith–Ninth Streets—to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having to wait in the station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.

Due to the MTA&#x27;s financial crisis in the late 2000s, as well as continued capacity issues on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, the G was to be cut back from Forest Hills–71st Avenue to Court Square at all times beginning June 27, 2010. However, due to planned track repairs during the times the G normally ran on the Queens Boulevard Line, it ceased running on that line on April 19. In addition, train headways were increased, which inconvenienced about 201,000 weekly commuters since they had to wait longer for G trains.

Flood waters from Hurricane Sandy caused significant damage to the Greenpoint Tubes under the Newtown Creek. Although the G was back in service days after the hurricane, the tube needed permanent repairs. To allow for these repairs, G service ran only between Nassau Avenue and Church Avenue for twelve weekends between July and December 2013. This schedule was also in effect daily between July 25 and September 2, 2014.

==Controversies==

In the 21st century, the G suffered from a wide range of issues that has resulted in complaints by people living along the route. Historically, it has connected only Brooklyn and Queens, resulting in many people thinking of the G as the subway system&#x27;s &quot;outcast&quot; and the &quot;unwanted drunk uncle everyone has.&quot; One reporter wrote of the G, &quot;[Riders] need it because it goes where no other train does, but they hate that they need it.&quot; Compounding to the G &quot;outcast&quot; reputation, some of the G stations along the Crosstown Line are in bad shape. Since 2001, a series of service cuts and missing connections to other lines has worsened public opinion of the G.

On December 16, 2001, the G northern terminus was cut back from Forest Hills to Court Square during weekdays, and since April 2010, this service pattern has applied at all times. This service pattern not only puts more ridership pressure on the E route—already one of the system&#x27;s busiest before 2001—but also resulted in G trains&#x27; lengths being shortened by one third, from or 6 cars to or 4. In addition, between 2001 and 2010, weekend service along the G to Forest Hills had been intermittent, with frequent service changes due to &quot;track work&quot;. The 2010 route reduction did increase service frequency on the remainder of the route. Finally, the G has few transfers to other services, with missing transfer points to the at Broadway and the at Fulton Street.

===63rd Street Connector service reductions===
When the connector to the IND 63rd Street Line from the IND Queens Boulevard Line was put into regular passenger service in December 2001, it not only introduced the new V service, but also allowed up to nine additional trains to and from Manhattan on the Queens Boulevard Line during peak hours. However, to make room for the V train on Queens Boulevard, the G had to terminate at Court Square on weekdays. The reroute of the G was part of the original plans of the 63rd Street tunnel and connector, going back to the late 1960s. The service plan was designed to redistribute Queens-bound passenger loads on the crowded IND Queens Boulevard Line, which ran under 53rd Street while in Manhattan. In turn, this plan was intended to bring better service and transfer opportunities, as the V train allowed direct access to 53rd Street and the IND Sixth Avenue Line for Queens Boulevard Local passengers who previously had to transfer to an express train at Queens Plaza. &quot;The New York Times&quot; prematurely described the service plan as &quot;complex and heavily criticized&quot; because it put more crowding on the E train.

In response to complaints from G riders at public hearings about losing a major transfer point to Manhattan-bound trains at Queens Plaza, the MTA agreed to a number of compromises, including installing a moving sidewalk in the passageway between Court Square and 23rd Street–Ely Avenue (now served by the ) on the Queens Boulevard Line. In addition, a free out-of-system MetroCard transfer to 45th Road–Court House Square on the IRT Flushing Line was created at those two stations. This special transfer was discontinued on June 3, 2011, when an in-system transfer opened at the corner of 23rd Street and 45th Road, which made only the Flushing Line station ADA-accessible. The MTA provided $17 million in funding for making the Crosstown Line accessible as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.

The MTA also agreed to extend the G to Forest Hills–71st Avenue during evenings and weekends (when the V was not running), and run more trains on that route. There was a four-hour period where the G, , and V, as well as the Queens Boulevard line&#x27;s express services, the E and the F, were all running at once since the V stopped running at midnight and the G was extended to 71st Avenue at 8:00 pm. The authority &quot;had spent several hundred thousand dollars on tests, trying to figure out a way to keep the G train running past Court Square and farther into Queens on weekdays, but because of the addition of the V train, which shared space along the Queens Boulevard Line with the trains already there (the E, F and R trains), G trains could not fit during the daytime, when service is heaviest.&quot;

However, due to construction on the Queens Boulevard Line, the G train frequently terminated at Court Square even when the published timetable said it ran to 71st Avenue. Some riders were suspicious that the service disruptions were &quot;simply a de facto way to implement the original plan of halving G train service.&quot; The original plans called for the G terminate at Court Square at all times; that plan was shelved in 2001 in the face of community opposition, but due to budget cuts, the MTA decided to implement it in 2010. An MTA spokesman said, &quot;It&#x27;s not personal... If you want to keep the system up to date, you need to make sure the track and switching are all in good repair.&quot;

Community groups such as Save the G! and the Riders Alliance have been frequent activists for improvements of G service. Save the G! regularly lobbied the MTA for more G train service since the original cutbacks when the V was introduced in 2001. They made the restoration of service to the Queens Boulevard Line at all times an issue in the 2002 New York gubernatorial race, but the transit authority said, &quot;Unfortunately, putting the G back to full service is just not an option, given our track capacity—and that&#x27;s not likely to change.&quot;

=== Changes to train length ===
To increase service and reduce waiting time due to the 63rd Street Connector cutbacks, the G would need more trains, but there were not enough cars available in the system. The solution was to reduce the length of trains to increase service frequency. Previously, the G service had run 8 car trains or 6 car trains; both were shorter than the typical length of B Division trains because ridership was deemed too low to justify running full-length G trains in frequent intervals. Under the 2001 plan, trains were shortened from six cars to four, sticking all the leftover cars together to make the extra trains for the G, and the additional trains needed for V service. Thus, G service now operates trains, half the length of normal B Division standards. It also operates One Person Train Operation (OPTO) service during late nights and weekends.

This, however, meant that riders would be packed into smaller trains, and led some passengers to miss trains because they were standing at the wrong part of the platform. In the past, there have been signs indicating where the train stops at some stations, in addition to the &quot;4&quot; and &quot;6&quot; markers next to the tracks used by train operators as stop points. Still, the overall lack of visual identifiers of train stop points on the platforms, the differing stop points during different times of day, and the location of staircases, transfer passageways and platform benches have been cited as a cause of passengers missing trains or being bunched into single cars. Beginning in 2013, additional signs were installed along G train platforms. In 2014, several improvements were implemented due to an infusion of extra funding, with G trains to be lengthened in 2019 (see below).

===Non-free transfers===
Save the G!, the Riders Alliance, and other organizations have also lobbied for the creation of new free out-of-system transfers to nearby stations. The most prominent is between Broadway on the Crosstown Line and either Hewes Street or Lorimer Street on the BMT Jamaica Line, which are both about three blocks away; this transfer has been previously proposed. In 2005, an MTA spokesperson stated, &quot;We have no intention of making that a permanent free transfer.&quot; This sentiment was repeated in 2013, with the MTA citing the loss of around $770,000 in revenue if the transfer were to become free.

Temporary free transfers have been provided in the past, including one to Lorimer Street in 1999 due to suspended service over the Williamsburg Bridge on the , and again during the Summer 2014 G service suspension north of Nassau Avenue. A second transfer, from Fulton Street to the busy Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center complex in Downtown Brooklyn, was rejected by the MTA due to the long walking distance between the two stations, as well as the fact that there is a transfer to Manhattan-bound trains at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets.

A temporary transfer between Broadway and Hewes Street or Lorimer Street (along the BMT Jamaica Line) was reinstated in April 2019 due to L train service changes associated with the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown. The transfer was in effect until May 31, 2020. A temporary, MetroCard-only transfer between 21st Street and Hunters Point Avenue (along the IRT Flushing Line) was proposed, but not implemented.

== Improvements ==
===2000s improvements===
Most stations along the IND Crosstown Line were built with multiple exits to the street. Over the years, many lower-use exits were closed (as they were in other parts of the subway), as the city was concerned that they were a magnet for criminals; this resulted in G trains along the Crosstown Line needing to stop at the locations closest to the exits. However, in July 2005, in response to community pressure, the MTA agreed to re-open an exit to the southwestern corner of South Portland Avenue to the southbound platform of the Fulton Street station. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as a &quot;minor victory&quot; for &quot;a maligned line.&quot; Additionally, exits to the intersection of Powers Street, Hope Street, and Union Avenue at Metropolitan Avenue were reopened on February 28, 2019, to address possible capacity constraints due to the L train shutdown. In 2019, the Court Square station received several new stairways to accommodate increased ridership from L train riders during the reconstruction of the BMT Canarsie Line tunnels under the East River, which started in late April 2019.

The G train&#x27;s southern extension to Church Avenue, implemented in 2009 and confirmed permanently in 2012, was also seen as a service improvement. It reduced the need for riders from Park Slope and Kensington to make multiple train transfers to get to northern Brooklyn and Long Island City.

===Review of the G route===
In 2013, at the request of State Senators Daniel Squadron and Martin Malave Dilan, the MTA conducted a review of the entire G route. The route had been maligned by riders because of its unreliability, and the review recommended a few service changes for the G. On June 9, 2014, a budget surplus in the MTA allowed these improvements to be implemented. These improvements included an increase in the number of trains per hour, from six to trains per hour during evening rush hour; uniform stopping locations for trains, whereas previously, trains stopped at different places along the platform at different times of the day; public service announcement systems on platforms along the IND Crosstown Line; relocated benches; and new CCTV systems installed for OPTO. Such improvements eliminated the infamous &quot;G train sprint,&quot; wherein riders ran for G trains that stopped at the other end of the platforms.

From 2010 to 2015, ridership on the G rose 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. At the time, it was the route with the fastest growing ridership base in the entire system. These improvements also had the additional benefit of being able to accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along the line, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford–Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This was due in part to the G weekday frequencies having become more dependable as a result of the 2013 review. Even so, the G continued to have long headways during weekends until July 2023.

===L train shutdown===
Despite the influx of ridership, train lengths did not change. In 2016, it was announced that the G was expected to receive longer trains to accommodate displaced L train riders in 2019, when the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown was supposed to limit direct L train access to Manhattan. As a result, riders in Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Bushwick would need to use the G to transfer to other subway routes that travel to Manhattan. The delivery of new R179 subway cars to other routes would make it possible for older fleets from these other routes to be passed onto the G. In addition, three extra G trains per hour would run during peak periods, for a total of 11 trains per hour during the shutdown. A full-length G train would run every five to six minutes, more than doubling the route&#x27;s total capacity. Since the G train&#x27;s schedule is designed around that of the F train, train frequencies on both routes would have to be modified.

In July 2018, the MTA published a report stating that the G route would have 15 full-length trains per hour between Court Square and Bedford–Nostrand Avenues, or a rate of one train every four minutes. South of Bedford–Nostrand Avenues, the G would have a headway of 12 trains per hour. The terminus for most of the remaining G trips would be Church Avenue, but some trains would continue two additional stops to 18th Avenue, because only a limited number of trains can terminate at Church Avenue without causing disruptions to F service. Other temporary improvements during the L train shutdown would include free-out-of-system transfers between the G at Broadway and the at Lorimer Street and Hewes Street, as well as between the G at 21st Street and the at Hunters Point Avenue. In addition, closed entrances would be reopened at Metropolitan Avenue, and the Nassau Avenue and Metropolitan Avenue stations&#x27; fare control areas would be reconfigured to accommodate increased ridership.

The L train shutdown was curtailed in January 2019. Instead of being a full-time closure, it would only be a partial closure on nights and weekends. However, the station enhancements along the route were still implemented. The following month, the MTA decided that the G would not receive full-length trains, though it would still see an increase in train frequencies during nights and weekends. A spokesperson for the MTA said in 2023 that there was not enough rolling stock available to allow G trains to be lengthened without decreasing frequencies. Weekend frequencies on the G route were increased in July 2023.

===CBTC signaling===
In December 2022, the MTA announced that it would award a $368 million design–build contract to Crosstown Partners, a joint venture between Thales Group and TC Electric LLC, to install communications-based train control (CBTC) along the length of the G route. The contract includes not only the Crosstown Line between Court Square and Bergen Street, but also the Culver Line between Bergen Street and Church Avenue. The project also included adding Wi-Fi in the tunnels. Upon the completion of the contract, the G would be one of three routes in the system to be entirely equipped with CBTC, besides the L and 7 trains.

To accommodate the CBTC upgrades, the Crosstown Line was partially closed in three phases starting on June 28, 2024, and G service was partially suspended. Initially, the northern half of the line was closed, followed by the southern half. Local politicians asked the MTA to operate full-length G trains and extend the route to Forest Hills following the partial closures. However, MTA chairman Janno Lieber said that longer G trains would not be restored until ridership levels increase, though the CBTC signaling would be capable of handling lengthened G trains. Full service resumed on September 3, 2024.

<text>Monroe Park is a landscaped park northwest of the Virginia State Capitol Building in Richmond, Virginia. It is named after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States (1817–1825). The park unofficially demarcates the eastern point of the Fan District and is Richmond&#x27;s oldest park. It occupies the center of the Virginia Commonwealth University Monroe Park Campus.

==Description==
Monroe Park is pentagonal in shape, with an arrangement of paved paths among lawns and mature deciduous trees, intersecting at a cast iron fountain in the center of the area. This Victorian park is currently in the planning process of a historically sensitive, extensive renovation. The Monroe Park Advisory Council, an organization constituted by Richmond City Councilman William Pantele in 2003, in partnership with the Richmond Department of Parks, Recreation and Community Facilities and Richmond&#x27;s Department of Community Development are leading the renovation initiative.

===Features===

A bronze statue of Williams Carter Wickham designed by Edward Virginius Valentine was erected in the Park in 1891. The work was the gift of Williams&#x27; fellow soldiers and the employees of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway.

In 2017, Clayton and Will Wickham, two of Wickham&#x27;s descendants, requested that the city of Richmond remove the statue. In their letter to the city council, the brothers wrote that &quot;as a plantation owner, Confederate general and industrialist, General Wickham unapologetically accrued power and wealth through the exploitation of enslaved people&quot;.

Public objections to the sculpture&#x27;s presence in Monroe Park increased during the 2020 George Floyd protests. In June 2020, protesters toppled the sculpture using ropes.

==History==
The land on which the Park is located was purchased by the City of Richmond in 1851 at the cost of $13,592.56. Originally, the land was used as the State Agricultural Fair Grounds in the mid-19th century. During the American Civil War the area was used as a military camp and military hospital. A central stone fountain was donated by U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Albert Ordway in 1872. It was later replaced with the current cast iron fountain in the early twentieth century. Monroe Park was home to the City&#x27;s first baseball games.

<text>Veronica Tennant, (born January 15, 1946) is a Canadian producer, director, and filmmaker and a former principal dancer of the National Ballet of Canada. She was born in London, England and moved to Canada with her parents and sister in 1955. Dancing from the age of four, by the age of 18, she became the youngest person ever to enter the National Ballet of Canada.

She made her debut as Juliet in the principal role in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with partner Earl Kraul on a choreography by John Cranko. She gave her last performance dancing Juliet again in the same ballet in February 1989. Her official farewell gala in November 1989 includes dance excerpts from &quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;Washington Square&quot;, &quot;Canciones&quot;, &quot;Masada&quot;, &quot;Onegin&quot; as well as a final pas de deux that she never performed before from Cranko&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

James Neufeld wrote in his book &quot;Passion to Dance. The National Ballet of Canada&quot; &quot;Veronica Tennant has built a major career and impressive artistic reputation almost entirely within the National Ballet of Canada. One of the company&#x27;s best-loved ballerinas, she was also a figure of national prominence on the Canadian cultural scene, an eloquent spokesperson for the importance of cultural values in the life of the nation&quot;. By 1976, she was a star at the National Ballet and touring across North America, Europe and Japan with Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rudolf Nureyev, and Anthony Dowell, among others, as prima ballerina. During her career from 1964 to 1989, she performed in many ballets by legendary choreographers; Sir Frederick Ashton, Roland Petit, Jiri Kylian, John Neumeier, and championed Canadian choreographers such as James Kudelka, Ann Ditchburn and Constantin Patsalas. Among her performances she appeared in &quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, &quot;Napoli&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;La Fille mal gardée&quot;, &quot;Onegin&quot;, &quot;The Dream&quot;, &quot;A Party&quot;, &quot;Washington Square&quot;, &quot;Hedda, Mad Shadows&quot;, &quot;Parranda Criolla&quot;, &quot;Kraanerg&quot;, &quot;The Newcomers&quot;, &quot;Whispers of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Realm&quot; in which she mostly interprets the leading roles.

She wrote two children books: the first, &quot;On stage, Please : A Story&quot; illustrated by Rita Briansky (published in 1977) and the second, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; illustrated by the former figure skater Toller Cranston (published in 1985) based on the story of E.T.A. Hoffmann.

As a producer, director and filmmaker, her films and documentaries related to dance were broadcast on channels like CBC, CTV and Bravo. Among them &quot;Salute to Dancers for Life/Danser pour la Vie&quot; (1994–95), &quot;Margie Gillis: Wild Hearts in Strange Times&quot; (1996); &quot;Karen Kain: Dancing in the Moment&quot; (1998); &quot;Northern Light - Visions and Dreams&quot; (2003); &quot;a pairing of SwanS&quot; (2004) and &quot;Celia Franca: Tour de Force&quot; (2006). Several of her productions have been awarded with Gemini Awards given by the Academy of Canadian Cinema &amp; Television.

Tennant is often invited as guest speaker, host and narrator as well as an actor. She performed in the leading role of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;On the Town&quot; at the Shaw Festival in 1992, and in the title role in &quot;The Piano Man&#x27;s Daughter&quot; with Timothy Findley, Sylvia Tyson and Joe Sealy in a 22 performance national tour under the direction of Paul Thompson in 1997.

Tennant is also involved in her community contributing on various artistic boards (Toronto Arts Awards Foundation, Glenn Gould Foundation, Dancer Transition Resource Centre) and charitable events. She has been honorary chair of UNICEF since 1992. In 2015, she conceived and directed &quot;NIÁGARA: A Pan-American Story&quot;, a multidisciplinary project for the 2015 Pan American Games.

==Awards==
Veronica Tennant has been awarded honorary doctorates from Brock University, York University, Simon Fraser University, McGill University and the University of Toronto. She serves often as keynote speaker. She has received several awards, including the Toronto Arts Award and the Arts and Letters Award from The Canadian Club of New York City.

In 1975, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2003. In 2001, she was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In 2006, she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2004, Tennant received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts.

<text>The Phoenix and the Carpet is a fantasy novel for children, written by E. Nesbit and first published in 1904. It is the second in a trilogy of novels that begins with &quot;Five Children and It&quot; (1902), and follows the adventures of the same five children: Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane and the Lamb. Their mother buys the children a new carpet to replace one from the nursery that they have destroyed in an accidental fire. The children find an egg in the carpet, which hatches into a talking Phoenix. The Phoenix explains that the carpet is a magic one that will grant them three wishes a day. The five children go on many adventures, which eventually wear out their magic carpet. The adventures are continued and concluded in the third book of the trilogy, &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot; (1906).

== Plot summary ==

This is the middle volume of a trilogy that begins with &quot;Five Children and It&quot; and concludes with &quot;The Story of the Amulet.&quot; It deviates from the other two novels insofar as it includes only a brief mention of the Psammead, a magical creature introduced in the first volume, and depicts the five children as living with both of their parents in the family home in London. In the other two volumes, circumstances have forced the children to spend protracted periods away from their home and their father. A continuing theme throughout &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; is the element of fire. 

The story begins shortly before 5 November, celebrated in Britain as Guy Fawkes Night, when people build bonfires and set off fireworks. The four children have accumulated a small hoard of fireworks for the night, but they are too impatient to wait until 5 November to light them, so they set off a few samples in the nursery. This results in the fire that destroys the original carpet. To replace it their parents purchase a second-hand carpet, which is found to contain an egg that emits a phosphorescent glow. The children accidentally knock the egg into the fire, whereupon it hatches, revealing a golden talking Phoenix.

It transpires that this is a magic carpet that can transport the children anywhere they wish, although it is capable of fulfilling only three wishes a day. Accompanied by the Phoenix, the children have exotic adventures. There is a moment of terror when the youngest, the baby known as the Lamb, crawls onto the carpet, babbles incoherently and vanishes, but it turns out that the Lamb only desires to be with his mother.

At a few points in the novel, the children find themselves in predicaments from which the Phoenix is unable to rescue them by himself, so he goes to find the Psammead and has a wish granted for the children&#x27;s sake. In addition, at the end the carpet is sent to ask the Psammead to grant the Phoenix&#x27;s wish. These offstage incidents are the only contributions made by the Psammead to this story.
&quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; features depictions of London during the reign of Edward VII. At one point, the children and their supernatural bird visit the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company: the egotistical Phoenix assumes that this is a temple dedicated to him and that the insurance executives must be his acolytes. The children also have an encounter with two older ruffians, Herb and Ike, who attempt to steal the Phoenix.

Four of the children (without the Lamb) attend a Christmas pantomime at a theatre in the West End of London, smuggling the Phoenix along inside Robert&#x27;s coat. The Phoenix is so excited by this spectacle that he unintentionally sets fire to the theatre. All ends well when the Phoenix magically reverses the damage: no one is harmed, and the theatre remains intact.

One aspect of &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; that is unusual for children&#x27;s fantasy fiction is the fact that the magical companion does not treat all the children equally. The Phoenix favours Robert, the child who put his egg in the fire, albeit by accident, over his brother Cyril and their sisters. This is a mixed privilege, as Robert is lumbered with the duty of smuggling the Phoenix past their parents at inconvenient moments.
In the novel&#x27;s final chapter, the Phoenix announces that he has reached the end of his current lifespan and must begin the cycle again, apparently on the grounds that life with the children has left him far more exhausted than he would have been in the wilderness. He lays a new egg from which he will eventually be reborn. Under the Phoenix&#x27;s direction, the children prepare an altar with sweet incense, upon which the Phoenix immolates himself. The magic carpet has also reached the end of its lifespan, as it was never intended to be walked upon regularly, and, at the request of the Phoenix, it takes the egg to a place where it won&#x27;t hatch again for 2,000 years. There is a happy ending, with the children receiving a parcel of gifts from an &quot;unknown benefactor&quot; (the Phoenix, who arranges this gift by means of a wish granted by the Psammead) and Robert receiving a single golden feather. But the feather has vanished by the evening.

The last volume in the trilogy, &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot;, contains a minor episode in which the children travel thousands of years into the past and encounter the Phoenix, who does not recognise them because the events of the previous book have not happened yet.

== Chapter summary ==
Chapter One: &quot;The Egg&quot;

When their old carpet is destroyed by their fireworks, the siblings get a new nursery carpet and discover a mysterious egg wrapped within it. Robert accidentally rolls the egg into the fire and out hatches the Phoenix, who tells the tale of the magic carpet.

Chapter Two: &quot;Topless Tower&quot;

The children go on their first adventure with the carpet and the Phoenix and while they discover treasure they also learn the limitations of the carpet and must get rescued by the Psammead&#x27;s wish fulfilling abilities.

Chapter Three: &quot;The Queen Cook&quot;

While on an adventure to cure the Lamb of whooping cough, the children are forced by circumstances to take along their cook. Once they are on a sunny tropical island, the Cook is thought to be a queen by the natives living on the island and is content to be left behind.

Chapter Four: &quot;Two Bazaars&quot;

The children go on an adventure with the carpet to India so they can find items for their mother to sell in her Bazaar, although matters are briefly complicated when the carpet is sold as well.

Chapter Five: &quot;The Temple&quot;

After helping the children change the weather to permit an adventure, the Phoenix asks them to take him to one of his temples. At the &quot;temple&quot;, the children and the Phoenix are honoured guests of a ceremony to celebrate the Phoenix, yet once they leave, all the gentlemen believe it to have been a dream.

Chapter Six: &quot;Doing Good&quot;

The carpet takes the children abroad to do a good deed; they meet a sad French family and return their family treasure to them (the treasure discovered in Chapter 2).

Chapter Seven: &quot;Mews from Persia&quot;

The children are meant to meet their aunt at the train station, but Robert forgot to send his mother&#x27;s instructions for the aunt to meet them. The children go home alone and break into their own home. The carpet wants to visit its homeland, so the children let it go and the carpet brings back 199 Persian cats.

Chapter Eight: &quot;The Cats, the Cow and the Burglar&quot;

The carpet takes away the musk-rats it had brought as food for the cats and brings a cow instead. Jane confronts a burglar, finds him kind, and gives him the cats to sell.

Chapter Nine: &quot;The Burglar’s Bride&quot;

The burglar has been arrested for allegedly stealing Persian cats, but the children rescue him and bring him to the tropical island where their former cook reigns as queen. The cook and the burglar like each other, and the carpet is sent to fetch a clergyman to marry them.

Chapter Ten: &quot;The Hole in the Carpet&quot;

Despite the damaged state of the carpet, the children desire to go on one more adventure before their mother returns. Robert and Jane fall through a hole in the carpet, which continues on and takes Cyril and Anthea to their Uncle Reginald. Jane and Robert fall into a house and meet the clergyman who married the cook and burglar, but they are rescued by the Phoenix getting help from the Psammead.

Chapter Eleven: &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot;

The children go to the theatre with the Phoenix. Believing the theatre to be its own temple, the Phoenix flies around and starts a fire. The carpet brings the children home safely and the Phoenix uses its powers to reverse the damage.

Chapter Twelve: &quot;The End of The End&quot;

The Phoenix begins to age and announces it must soon leave. It lays its egg and is consumed by fire. What remains of the carpet is given to the Psammead, who in return grants the Phoenix&#x27;s last wish: to send the children all the toys they have ever wanted.

== Characters ==
Main characters:
Cyril – the oldest of the five children. He is nicknamed Squirrel. Cyril often takes on the role of leader and is sensible and level-headed. He is also the main decision-maker for the children. Although his decisions are sometimes challenged, he often has the final say in what the children do. Between the two older boys, Cyril is more considerate of morals when making decisions.

Anthea – the second oldest of the children. Her nickname is Pantha or Panther. She takes on the role of a mother figure. She is rational, polite, considerate, and well-mannered. She also considers morals when helping to make decisions. Anthea is the one who has the sewing skills to fix the carpet and who demonstrates the most compassion and remorse for it.

Robert – the third oldest of the five children. His nickname is Bob or Bobs. The Phoenix is most attached to him because he originally dropped the egg into the fire. Although Robert is one of the younger children, he represents an adult voice in the story – he recollects and tells the other children &#x27;facts&#x27; that he gathered from his father over the years. He is also the one child who thinks to bring candles on their adventures after experiencing the dark tower and cave on the first carpet trip. He often takes on the role of protector of his sisters and the Phoenix.

Jane – the fourth child in the family. Her nickname is Pussy. She is a stereotypical representation of a nineteenth-century &#x27;girl&#x27; child – innocent, afraid, and in need of male protection. She is also the one who persuades the burglar to milk the cow instead of robbing the house.

Lamb/Hilary – the baby and youngest of the children. His nickname is Lamb. His given name, Hilary, is revealed in the first book of the trilogy (&quot;Five Children and It&quot;). He is curious and reliant on others. He also exemplifies childhood innocence. His solo adventure on the carpet is one of the reasons why the children decide that the Phoenix and carpet must go.

Phoenix – a vain and arrogant creature, although less so than the Psammead. He hides the fact that he cares for the children until they are in trouble. He is also lonely and in constant search of praise. The Phoenix becomes the primary decision-maker and rescuer for the children when they cannot agree on where to go or how to get out of a situation. He is the only one who understands the carpet.

Carpet – a silent figure in the story, and yet one of the most important characters. It cannot think for itself, it is obedient and noble, and it endures the children&#x27;s abuse. Although the carpet places the children in bad situations, it is also the instrument often used to extract them from those situations.

Supporting characters:

Father – The father is relatively absent from the story. He shows up to entertain the children but leaves other child-rearing duties to the mother. It is the father who sends the four older children to the playhouse. He is the stereotypical father figure of the nineteenth century.

Mother – Mother is the angel of the house. She is most concerned with Lamb and gives the other children more freedom to do what they please. She goes out of the house often to meet with friends and takes part in social activities such as the bazaar.

Cook – In the beginning of the story the cook is constantly frustrated, annoyed by the children, impatient, and unpleasant to everyone in the household. She sees the children as a menace and cause of her stress. Once she becomes Queen of the island natives she becomes calm, serene, and cheerful, and she enjoys praise. On the island she never comes to accept reality and instead thinks she is in a long dream.

Burglar – The Burglar is simple-minded, kind, and somewhat inexperienced. He is swayed by Jane to milk the cow instead of rob the house. He is even convinced to take the cats that he hates. Although he goes to jail for selling the cats on the street, once he is freed by the children he marries the cook.

Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop – The Reverend performs the marriage ceremony for the cook and burglar. He is indecisive, friendly, honest, and curious of things magical or unknown to him. He is also a scientist and botanist.

Psammead – The Psammead is a magical figure connected to the children from the first book. It is never seen in the text by anyone but the children. This creature takes on the role of a Deus Ex Machina – it steps in throughout the story to rescue the children from the various situations they find themselves in.

== Themes and issues ==
References to other works: Nesbit alludes to many different works of literature that were familiar to and recognised by children in the early 20th century, including &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s tales of India, &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; and many others. She also assumes that her readers are familiar with religious works such as the &quot;New Version of the Psalms of David&quot; and popular magazines such as &quot;The Strand&quot;, the magazine in which &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; first appeared. 

Referenced in other works: In &quot;Part Three&quot; of the book &quot;The Dark is Rising&quot;, by &quot;Susan Cooper&quot;, &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; is mentioned being read aloud to children during a terrible snow storm while many of the local villagers, including the main character &quot;Will&quot;, take shelter in the &quot;Old Manor house&quot;.

Gender roles: The female children, Anthea and Jane, undertake the domestic work that appears in the story while the male children Cyril and Robert become absent at such times. Nesbit&#x27;s Phoenix is not described in terms of gender.

Intrusion fantasy: &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; is an intrusion fantasy that includes marvellous creatures, such as the Phoenix, magical objects, such as the flying carpet, and fantastic events, such as flying on the carpet, that intrude into the realistic world in which the protagonists live. Normally characters in intrusion fantasy are surprised by the fantastic elements that enter their world. However, the children in &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; are not surprised because they have encountered fantastic elements in Five Children and It. Adults within the novel are in disbelief of the fantastic elements because they try to rationalise the fantastic as a dream or insanity. 

Social class: Nesbit wrote for the great middle-class of readers, and this novel contains some stereotypes of both the upper and lower classes. The cook, a lower-class character, is voiced in an ungrammatical pidgin-english; for instance, she says &quot;...there&#x27;s that there new carpet in their room...&quot; (Chapter 3). The upper class, on the other hand, have money, status, education and leisure time to pursue such activities as theatregoing. The children&#x27;s mother often leaves them behind to attend the theatre.

Narration: Nesbit&#x27;s narrator seems to be an adult voice speaking to the child reader. The narrator comments on the story and asks the reader questions to give a fuller picture. 

Realistic portrayal of children: Nesbit was known for her well-drawn child characters, described in &quot;Norton&#x27;s Anthology of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; as &quot;believable middle-class children who experience a series of adventures in unforeseen circumstances&quot; (Zipes, et al.). They are generally good-natured and well-meaning, but they also quarrel amongst each other and get into trouble. They nearly burn their nursery down by setting off fireworks, call each other names and argue over trivial matters. Still, they did not mean for their fireworks to get out of control, they look out for one another, and they have a strong sense of right and wrong. Nesbit thus gently subverts the Romantic stereotype of children as innocent little angels.

Racial issues: Nesbit&#x27;s work has been criticised by some critics as being racist and having anti-Semitic characterisations. In Chapter 3 of this novel the children encounter people described as having copper-toned skin, whom they immediately assume are savage cannibals.
== Adaptations ==

There have been at least four film adaptations of the novel. The BBC produced three television series: one week of &quot;Jackanory&quot; in 1965, another written by John Tully that aired in 1976, and finally &quot;The Phoenix and the Carpet&quot; (1997), with a new screenplay by Helen Cresswell.

A feature film was released in 1995: &quot;The Phoenix and the Magic Carpet&quot;, written by Florence Fox, directed by Zoran Perisic, starring Peter Ustinov as Grandfather and the voice of Phoenix, and Dee Wallace as Mother.

Bonsor was born in Polesden Lacey on 2 September 1848, the son of Joseph Bonsor. He was educated at Eton and with his father and brother became a partner in the brewing firm of Combe &amp; Co. He was a director of the Bank of England, and a Governor of Guy&#x27;s Hospital.

Bonsor married Emily Gertrude Fellowes in 1872. She died in London on 18 July 1882, and he remarried to Mabel Grace Brand on 3 March 1886.

In 1885 Bonsor was elected M.P. for Wimbledon and held the seat until 1900. Also in 1885, Bonsor purchased the estate of Kingswood Warren, Surrey from Sir John Cradock Hartopp and lived there until 1906 when he put it on the market because of the rising cost of maintenance.

In 1898 Bonsor organised the brewery amalgamation to form Watney Combe &amp; Reid, of which he remained chairman until 1928.

Bonsor was created a baronet on 26 January 1925. He died four years later at the age of 81 in Nice. He was buried in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard. Bonsor was a public benefactor and was loved locally for his kindness and generosity to all. His son Reginald succeeded to the baronetcy.

==Railway service==
In 1895 Bonsor was appointed deputy-chairman of the South Eastern Railway (SER), and was elected chairman of that railway following the death of the incumbent, Sir George Russell, Bart, on 7 March 1898. At the start of 1899 the SER entered into a working union with its neighbour and hitherto competitor, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). Each of the two railways provided four members of the new South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway Companies Joint Management Committee, and Bonsor was elected Chairman of that body, retaining his SER post. He retired from railway service upon the formation (by amalgamation of the SER, LCDR and other railways) of the Southern Railway at the start of 1923. In 1899 he formed a private syndicate to extend the Tattenham Corner Line from Kingswood railway station to Tattenham Corner railway station to take the racegoing traffic to Epsom Downs Racecourse. A train named in his honour formerly ran as part of the Southern services to London Bridge. The train stock was of Class 456.

<text>Dario Castello (Venice, bapt. 19 October 1602 - Venice 2 July 1631) was an Italian composer and violinist from the early Baroque period who worked and published in Venice. As a composer, he was a late member of the Venetian School and had a role in the transformation of the instrumental canzona into the sonata.

==Biographical details==
Dario Domenico Castello was born in Venice, where he was baptised on 19 October 1602.

The title page of the 1621 edition of the first volume of the &quot;Sonate Concertate in stil moderno&quot; records him as &quot;Capo di Compagnia de Musichi d&#x27;Instrumenti da fiato in Venetia,&quot; indicating that he led a Venetian company of &quot;piffari&quot;, a band that could include sackbuts, cornetts, shawms, but also violins and viols.&lt;br&gt;
On 19 November 1624 he was appointed «sonador di violin» (violin player) of the St. Mark&#x27;s music chapel, at the time headed by Claudio Monteverdi.

The title page of the second volume (1629) of the &quot;Sonate concertate in Stil moderno&quot; lists him as &quot;Musico Della Serenissima Signoria di Venetia in S. Marco, &amp; Capo di Compagnia de Instrumenti,&quot; indicating that he worked at the great Basilica of St. Mark&#x27;s where Claudio Monteverdi was &quot;maestro di capella&quot;. Castello&#x27;s use of the &quot;stile concitato&quot; (agitated style) —with quick repeated-note figures— is consistent with his association with Monteverdi.

His brother Francesco (trombonist) and his father Giovanni Battista (violinist) also were working at St Mark&#x27;s.

Dario Castello died in Venice on 2 July 1631 during the great plague of 1630.

==Style==
Of his music, 29 separate compositions survive. Castello&#x27;s music is inventive and technically challenging. Strictly worked polyphonic sections alternate with dramatic recitatives over basso continuo, in keeping with the title of the publications &quot;in stil moderno&quot;; however he also uses some of the older canzona technique, which uses short sections of highly contrasting texture, and active rather than lyrical melodic lines. Unusually for the time, Castello often specifies the instruments for each part, calling for cornetti, violins, sackbuts and dulcians. That these works were still being reprinted in the 1650s attests to Castello&#x27;s influence. Modern editions of the complete sonatas are published by Ut Orpheus Edizione.

<text>The PK (, transliterated as &quot;Pulemyot Kalashnikova&quot;, or &quot;Kalashnikov&#x27;s machine gun&quot;), is a belt-fed general-purpose machine gun, chambered for the 7.62×54mmR rimmed cartridge. The modernized and most commonly known variant, known as the PKM, features several enhancements over the original PK design.

Designed in the Soviet Union and currently in production in Russia, the original PK machine gun was introduced in 1961 and the improved PKM variant was introduced in 1969. The PKM was designed to replace the SGM and RP-46 machine guns that were previously in Soviet service.

The weapon remains in use as a front-line infantry and vehicle-mounted weapon with Russia&#x27;s armed forces and has also been exported extensively and produced in several other countries under license.

==History==

The Main Artillery Directorate of the Soviet Union (GRAU) adopted specification requirements for a new 7.62 mm general-purpose company and battalion-level machine gun that was to be chambered for a rifle cartridge in 1955.

In 1958 a machine gun prototype the Nikitin-Sokolov PN1, developed by G.I. Nikitin and Yuri M. Sokolov, successfully passed field tests. Based on the results of the tests it was decided in 1960 to manufacture a batch of Nikitin-Sokolov machine guns for service tests and then put the machine gun into production at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant. However, the weapon had some flaws, the main flaw being that the weapon did not resist water and snow very well. Water and snow had a tendency to enter the gas piston. If, after firing, the machine gun was in the water, then after two or three shots the machine gun could fire exclusively only shot by shot. After a single shot, the shooter had to reload the weapon and move the slide manually two or three times. The army therefore asked Nikitin to solve this problem, but the engineer took too long to resolve this problem. In order to force Nikitin to work faster, the Main Artillery and Missile Directorate decided in 1958 to restart the competition. For that a team of Izhevsk Mechanical Plant designers, headed by M.T. Kalashnikov, and further consisting of V.V. Krupin, V.N. Pushchin, A.D. Kryakushin, as well as Startsev, Kamzolov, Koryakovtsev, Yuferev, joined the competition. Kalashnikov and his team accepted the task while at the same time, they were already working on the design of the AKM and the RPK. Kalashnikov accepted the task despite his workload and the fact that Nikitin&#x27;s PN1 had already been chosen by the army and that the latter was supported by certain ministries and senior officers. Their machine gun prototype was based on the well-proven gas-operated rotary-bolt design of the Kalashnikov-pattern arms.

The Kalashnikov and the Nikitin-Sokolov prototypes underwent service tests in the Central Asian, Odessa, and Baltic Military Districts, as well as at the Vystrel officer training courses in late 1960. The Main Missiles and Artillery Directorate and the Ministry of the Defence Industry preferred the Kalashnikov design. The PK could resist water perfectly, but it was also much easier to maintain and manufacture, because it reused the same ammunition bands as the Maxim or SG-43, while the PN1 used a new type of bands which was not yet in production at the time. Furthermore, according to Kalashnikov, its competitors attempted to bias the test by asking operators to lower the rate of fire because of overlapping bands during long bursts. There was also another incident during the test, according to Kalashnikov, the recoil of the PN1 was poorly distributed and a large part ended up in the stock; the pressure was so great that one of the soldiers responsible for testing the PN1 broke his cheekbone.

Based on the test results, the army preferred the Kalashnikov design. In 1961, the 7.62x54R mm Kalashnikov universal machine gun was adopted and put into production. The production of the PK/PKS took place at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant and used the tripod mount and an ammunition belt boxes originally designed for the Nikitin-Sokolov prototype machine gun.

Nikitin&#x27;s and Sokolov&#x27;s machine gun design was later used in the 12.7 mm NSV heavy machine gun that was put into production in 1971.

In June 2024, it&#x27;s reported that the PKZ will eventually replace the PKM in Russian military service.

==Design details==
The original &quot;PK&quot; was a development of Kalashnikov&#x27;s AKM assault rifle and the accompanying RPK light machine gun design that featured stamped receivers. The PK uses the 7.62×54mmR Eastern Bloc standard cartridge that produces significantly more bolt thrust when compared to the Eastern Bloc 7.62×39mm and 5.45×39mm intermediate cartridges.
With the use of a single spare parts kit and two barrel assemblies the service life of the modernized PKM machine gun series is guaranteed for at least 25,000 rounds.

===Operating mechanism===

The bolt and carrier design are similar to the AK-47 and other modernised Kalashnikov-pattern weapons, as is the stripping procedure performed to remove those mechanisms from the gun for cleaning. The bolt and bolt carrier are however oriented upside down compared to the AKM, with the piston and gas system being underneath the barrel.

Unlike the AKM and RPK the PK machine gun series is an open bolt design, which improves heat management during automatic fire compared to closed bolt designs and helps avoiding the dangerous phenomenon known as &quot;cook-off&quot;, wherein the firing chamber becomes so hot that the propellant contained in a chambered round unintentionally ignites, making the weapon fire until the ammunition is exhausted. Open bolt designs typically operate much cooler than closed bolt designs due to the airflow allowed into the chamber, action and barrel during pauses between bursts, making them more suitable for constant full-automatic weapons such as machine guns. General-purpose machine guns like the PK are further normally issued with several quick change barrels that during prolonged intense use are swapped out allowing one barrel to cool while the machine gun fires with the other.

The rimmed 7.62×54mmR cartridges are set in a metal ammunition belt and are held against the shoulder inside non disintegrating looped links, leaving the rim exposed at the rear. The belt is mounted from the right side into the feed way of the PK machine gun. The PK uses a non-reciprocating charging handle on the right side of the receiver to charge the gun. Since the PK uses a rimmed rifle cartridge and closed-link belts used for feeding, a two-stage feed mechanism with a preliminary extraction of a cartridge from a belt link was preferred over a direct ammunition feed design often used for rimless cartridges.

The PK machine gun is equipped with a lever-type feed mechanism introduced in Louis Stange&#x27;s MG 39 Rh and copied in the Czechoslovak machine guns like vz. 52 and vz. 59, which is operated by the feed lever. The lever, which is simplified compared to the prior art, is mounted on the right wall of the receiver and wraps around the bolt carrier with its feed pawl and roller. The rest of the mechanism is mounted either on the receiver cover or on the ammunition feed tray cover hinged under it. The PK feed mechanism pulls the rimmed 7.62×54mmR cartridges out from the back of the ammunition belt and drops the cartridges down into the feed way, allowing the bolt to strip and feed the cartridges into the chamber for firing.

The PK feed mechanism is radically different from that of 7.62×51mm NATO machine guns based on the MG 42 feed mechanism that typically incorporate a much larger (and therefore much heavier) articulated feed cam, lever, and pawl assembly that pushes rimless cartridges out forward from their links directly into the chamber for firing.

The PK fires from the rear sear. The breech is locked by a rotating bolt, with two locking lugs engaging locking recesses in the receiver. The gas piston is hinged to the bolt carrier assembly, and its vertical travel makes it possible to bend the group making machine gun assembly and disassembly for maintenance easier. The protruding rear part of the bolt carrier assembly features spiral shaped cuts, which provide a controlled rotation of the bolt. The mainspring is accommodated in the bolt carrier assembly slide channel. A cartridge extractor with a latch is mounted in the rear part of the bolt carrier assembly. The cocking lever, mounted on the right, is not integral with the bolt carrier and does not reciprocate as the gun fires.

The gas cylinder is mounted under the barrel and fitted with a gas regulator with three fixed positions. The gas regulator opens corresponding holes to change the amount of expanding propellant gases bled off out of the gas cylinder into the atmosphere, thus varying the amount of energy transferred on to the long-stroke piston.

===Receiver===
The PK general-purpose machine gun U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth sheet of steel that is supported extensively by pins and rivets. For additional rigidity and strength the PK receiver features double walls made from 1.5 mm steel plates that are welded together with the U-shaped stamping. The receiver top cover is also stamped from 1.5 mm sheet metal and hinged on the front of the receiver and locked at the back with a spring-loaded latch.

===Barrel===
The quick detachable barrel assembly slides into the receiver and attaches by a barrel-lock. On the original PK it was partially fluted to increase rigidity and improve heat dissipation. The barrel-lock also regulates the gap between the breech face and the breech end of the barrel. PK barrels have a folding carry handle/grip that is positioned to the left of the receiver and is used to transport the weapon and quickly and safely change-out barrels to prevent barrel overheating. The bore is chrome-lined and features four right-hand grooves at a 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in) rifling twist rate. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a flash hider. The muzzle was normally equipped with a conical flash suppressor that added to the barrel and later a long slotted flash suppressor that added to the barrel. Later when the PKM variant was introduced the PK series barrel fluting was omitted and the muzzle device was changed to a shorter cylindrical slotted flash suppressor that added to the barrel. The PKM barrel assembly weighs and can fire up to 400 rounds in rapid fire scenarios before it has to be replaced for another barrel or allowed to cool down to prevent unacceptable wear of the bore. The sustainable effective rate of fire is about 250 rounds per minute. Whilst, the cyclic rate of fire is around 600–800 rounds per minute.

===Sights===
====Iron sights====
The rear sight assembly is riveted onto the receiver cover and consist of a square notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in increments from and includes a &quot;point-blank range&quot; battle zero setting corresponding to a zero. It is identical in design to the AKM and Mosin–Nagant, except that it is oriented backwards with the notch forward and the hinge behind. The iron sight line has a sight radius. Like the RPD rear sight, the PK rear sight also features full windage adjustment in the form of small dials on either side of the notch.

The front sight assembly is mounted near the end of the barrel and consists of a protected open post adjustable for elevation in the field.

====Optical sights====
PK machine guns that feature a Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket on the left side of the receiver can mount various aiming optics. The standard Russian side rail mounted optical sight was the 4×26 1P29 Universal sight for small arms, an aiming optic similar to the British SUIT and SUSAT and Canadian C79 optical sights. When mounted, the 1P29 sight is positioned centered above the receiver at a height that allows the use of the iron sights. It weighs 0.8 kg, offers 4× magnification with a field of view of 8° and 35 mm eye relief. The 1P29 is issued with a canvas pouch, a lens cleaning cloth, combination tool, two rubber eyecups, two eyecup clamps and three different bullet drop compensation (BDC) cams for the AK-74, RPK-74 and PK machine gun. The 1P29 is intended for quickly engaging point and area targets at various ranges. On the right side of the field of view a stadiametric rangefinder is incorporated that can be used to determine the distance from a tall object from . The reticle is an inverted aiming post in the top half of the field of view and is tritium-illuminated for low-light condition aiming. A later designed similar optical sight suitable for the PK machine gun series is the 4×24 1Р77.

===Trigger===
The trigger assembly, mounted inside the receiver, is operated by the mainspring and suitable for automatic fire. It has no single shot mode of fire. The manual rotating type safety locks the sear, which engages the sear notch of the bolt carrier assembly, and the trigger lug does not allow the bolt carrier assembly to go all the way back.

===Stock===

The skeletonized buttstock, pistol grip and folding carry handle/grip on the barrels were originally manufactured from birch plywood laminates. Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process. Small accessories and an oil-solvent container can be stored inside butt recesses. Later the buttstock was fitted with a hinged butt-rest. More recent PKM machine guns and barrel assemblies are equipped with a new black glass-filled polyamide buttstock, pistol grip and barrel carry handle/grip shaped like the previously used laminated wooden stock and grips.

===Feeding===
PK machine guns are belt-fed, using non-disintegrating metal belts, which have links that wrap around the cartridge case shoulder all the way around, and are linked by a coiling wire on each side. The links are made of thick high carbon stamped steel sheet metal that is zinc phosphated and varnished for protection. These belts are preloaded at ammunition factories in 25-round connectable belt lengths and can be linked to any length necessary. Factory connected PK ammunition belts are available in 25, 100, 200 and 250 rounds lengths. Typical of Soviet machine guns, the PK feeds from the right and ejects its spent cases via an ejection port on the left side of the weapon, contrary to the right side ejection port seen in most Western machine guns.

For the light machine gun role, the PK is used as the standard squad automatic weapon of the Russian Army. The PK uses a 100-round non-disintegrating belt contained in a metal box made from an aluminium frame and steel cover that can be attached under the gun&#x27;s receiver. The 100-round belt &quot;assault&quot; box has a folding lid in its cover for feeding the ammunition belt when the box is attached under the machine gun receiver and weighs or for the modernised all aluminium lightweight variant. When the machine gun is fired from a bipod, the 100-round ammunition box is normally attached to the underside of the receiver.

For the medium machine gun role, there is also a 200/250-round ammunition box made from an aluminium frame and steel cover available which can be mounted on the tripods used for the PK machine gun series. A 200/250-round ammunition box containing a 250-round non-disintegrating belt weighs and containing a 200-round non-disintegrating belt weighs or for the modernised all aluminium lightweight variant. Both metal ammunition boxes have canvas carry handles.

All openings on the machine gun, particularly the ejector port on the left and the belt feed entrance on the right, are covered with spring-loaded dust covers so that the openings are only exposed when they need to be.

===Accessories===
The PK is equipped with a simple detachable bipod mounted to the gas cylinder beneath the barrel and in that light machine gun setup is used as a squad-level support weapon. The right bipod leg accommodates links of a cleaning rod. Other accessories include a sling and storage covers.

The PK machine gun is also suitable for installation on tripod mounts or vehicle mounted medium machine gun setups and can also be used as a light anti-aircraft weapon against slow flying aircraft when it is put on an AA mount.

As with all general-purpose machine guns, tripod and vehicle mountings offer a higher degree of accuracy and control than when used on a less stable bipod. The PK machine gun, firing short bursts from a bipod, as a light machine gun has the following accuracy of fire: a mean deviation of at a range of , at , and at . The Russian and other European militaries use a circular error probable method that assumes a 50% hit probability (R50).

==Variants==
===PKS===
For heavier employment, the PKS (ПК Станковый: &quot;PK Mounted&quot;) is based on the Samozhenkov 6T2 tripod mount. The PK and 6T2 tripod weigh .

The 6T2 Samozhenkov general-purpose tripod mount was designed by E. S. Samozhenkov and entered service in 1961 and weighs . The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was earlier envisioned for the Nikitin-Sokoiov machine gun that was not adopted by the Soviet Union. All types of ammunition belt boxes are carried and mounted separately. The Rakov device is used for loading ammunition belts. The PK machine gun is attached to a cradle on the 6T2 Samozhenkov mount. The cradle is hinged to a plug-in swivel equipped with a rack-and-pinion traversing mechanism, and a rod-and-screw elevation mechanism. The traversing mechanism is fitted with stops to limit the field of fire. For anti-aircraft fire or fire against ground targets from a kneeling position the cradle mounts a collapsible pole with a pivoting bracket. The mount features non-digging-in spades — sliding spades affect the accuracy of fire less than a &quot;jumping&quot; tripod with dug-in spades. There is an extra folding spade on the front leg for slippery and moving ground. Hinged tripod legs allow a gunner to fire the machine gun from a prone, a sitting, or a kneeling position.

The PKS machine gun, firing bursts from its tripod with fixed traversing and elevation mechanisms, as a medium machine gun has the following accuracy of fire: mean deviation of at a range of , cm at , and at . The Russian and other European militaries use a circular error probable method that assumes a 50% hit probability (R50) and cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining small arms accuracy. When the R50 results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7%.

===PKB===
The PKB is a variant of the PK that has been designed for use as a pintle mounted machine gun on combat vehicles. A swivel has been attached to the middle of the PKB. Another configuration of the PKB has the normal stock and trigger mechanism removed and replaced by twin spade grips and a butterfly trigger.

===PKT===
The PKT (ПК Танковый, &quot;PK Tank&quot;) (1968) is a solenoid-fired coaxial version of PK to replace the SGMT Goryunov vehicle-mounted machine gun. Modifications include the removal of the stock, a longer () and heavier barrel that adds muzzle velocity, a gas regulator and an electric solenoid trigger. The PKT minimum cyclic rate of fire is 100 rounds per minute higher than other PK-series variants and is usually fed from 250-round ammunition boxes. The PKT barrel assembly weighs and can fire up to 500 rounds in rapid fire scenarios before it has to be replaced for another barrel or allowed to cool down to prevent unacceptable wear of the bore. Some PKTs have been converted to infantry machine guns.

===PKM===
The PKM (ПК Модернизированный: &quot;Kalashnikov&#x27;s Machine-gun Modernised&quot;), was adopted into service in 1969. The PKM is a modernised, product-improved version of the PK. The upgrades are primarily aimed at reducing the weight, simplifying production, and facilitating easier operation. The receiver cover became more rigid due to lengthwise ribs. The butt was fitted with a hinged butt-rest. The barrel fluting was omitted and the flash hider was changed. Later on the PKM was equipped with a new black glass-filled polyamide buttstock and pistol grip shaped like the previously used laminated wooden stock and grip.

==== PKMN ====
The PKMN (ПКМ Ночной: &quot;PKM Night-Vision&quot;) is a variant that can mount a night sight for low-visibility operations. The PKMN-1 can thus mount the multi-model NSPU-3 (1PN51) night vision scope while the PKMN-2 can mount the multi-model NSPUM (1PN58) night vision scope. It can also be fitted with the 1PN93 series passive night sights.

Besides the Shakhin and 1PN116 thermal sights and the 1PN119 anti-sniper special-purpose night vision sight are available for mounting on PK machine guns that like the PKMN model feature a Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket on the left side of the receiver for mounting aiming optics.

==== PKMS ====
For heavier employment, the PKMS (ПКМ Станковый: &quot;PKM Mounted&quot;) is mounted on the Stepanov 6T5 tripod mount. The PKM and 6T5 tripod weigh .

The tripod mount, designed by L. V. Stepanov for the PKM machine gun entered service in 1969. The Stepanov tripod mount is almost entirely made from stamped steel and weighs . It is lighter and has 20 fewer components than the preceding Samozhenkov tripod; its production is 40% less labour-intensive; and its design does not reduce the accuracy of fire compared to the Samozhenkov tripod. The Stepanov mount is based on a principle of multi-functional components: the elevation mechanism frame is also used as a pole for kneeled shooting or anti-aircraft fire; the base sleeve also serves as the axis for attaching rear legs of the tripod; the machine gun attachment is combined with the elevation mechanism frame lock for anti-aircraft fire; the fine elevation adjustment mechanism is integrated with the elevation mechanism axis. Each tripod leg can be folded for transport or adjusted for proper height on uneven terrain. The ammunition belt box can be secured to the right rear tripod leg in such a manner that the gun can be moved with the ammunition box still in place and with the gun loaded. This enables one crew member to carry and operate the gun in combat without having to unload the gun before repositioning.

==== PKMSN ====
The PKMSN (ПКМС Ночной: &quot;PKMS Night-Vision&quot;) is a special model of the tripod-mounted variant (PKMS) that can mount night sights for low-visibility operations, similar to the PKMN.

The PKMSN variant can use NSPU-3 (1PN51) and NSPUM (1PN58) night sights. It can also be fitted with the 1PN93 series passive night sights.

Besides that Shakhin and 1PN116 thermal sights and the 1PN119 anti-sniper special-purpose night vision sight are available for mounting on PK machine guns that like the PKMSN model feature a Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket on the left side of the receiver for mounting aiming optics.

==== PKTM ====
Modernised version of the PKT.

==== PKBM ====
Modernised version of the PKB.

===PKP &quot;Pecheneg&quot;===


* The PKP &quot;Pecheneg&quot; (6P41) (2001) is a further development and modification of the PKM. It has a heavy fixed barrel encased in a radial cooling sleeve that uses forced-air cooling, much like the Lewis Gun of World War I.
* 6P41N Pecheneg-NP version with a rail for mounting nightscopes.
* Pecheneg-SP (6P69) improved modernised version.

=== Foreign copies ===

==== HCP PKM-NATO prototype and UKM-2000 (Poland) ====
In the early 1990s, as part of the preparations to join NATO, the Polish armed forces were looking for a replacement for the PK-series machine guns then in service. The H. Cegielski - Poznań S.A. Works in Poznań modified the PK/PKS to feed standard 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges and use NATO standard ammunition belts. The new model received the code-name PKM-NATO (or PKM-N). The modifications included a heavier barrel, a larger chamber, and a redesign of the lock, bolt, extractor, and the entire feeding mechanism. The prototype was tested from 1997 to 1999, but was rejected.

The Polish Army adopted the UKM-2000 machine gun instead in 2007, which was also based on the PKM.

==== Zastava M84/M86/M09/M10 (Yugoslavia/Serbia) ====
The Zastava M84 is a Yugoslav/Serbian-made licensed copy of the PK/PKS. The Zastava M86 is a copy of the solenoid-triggered PKT. These variants can be easily recognised by their unhollowed stock.

The Zastava M09 is a copy of the PKM with black synthetic furniture, chambered in 5.56x45 NATO ammo. The Zastava M10 is a variant of the M09 with a solid stock.

==== Norinco Type 80 (People&#x27;s Republic of China) ====
The Type 80 is a Chinese-made copy of the PKM/PKMS.

The 7.62×51mm NATO variant CS/LM4 is also available for export.

==== Arsenal MG, MG-M1, MG-M1S, MG-1M, MG-M2, and MG-M2S (Bulgaria) ====

Arsenal originally produced the MG, modeled after the original Russian PK model. The MG-M1 is a licensed copy of the PKM with a synthetic buttstock and pistol grip. The MG-M1S only differs from the MG-M1 model due to the use of a tripod by the M1S model, where as the M1 model uses the original bi-pod design.

The MG-1M, an improved Squad Automatic Weapon variant, has improved features, such as a redesigned barrel that allows for better cooling. The MG-M2 and MG-M2S are the M1 and M1S model that were chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO.

In 2023 a group of Ukrainian volunteers purchased 1,460 PKMs from Bulgaria for a value of 6.75 million €, or a little more than 4,500 € per machine gun.

==== Cugir Mitraliera md. 66 (Romania) ====
The Mitraliera md. 66 is a Romanian-made copy of the PKM.

==== Mayak KM-7.62, KT-7.62 and KTM-7.62 (Ukraine) ====
The Mayak KM-7.62 is a copy of the PKM, made to be lighter and easier to handle. It first appeared in 2011. The KT-7.62 and KTM-7.62 are copies of the PKT, first appearing in 2011.

== Production status ==
The PKM and other variants are in production in Russia and are currently exported to many nations. Additionally, various models are manufactured locally around the globe. A remotely controlled PKT version was reportedly entered service in November 2023. Zastava Arms produces the PK under license as the M84 (along with the PKT as the M86), and it remains in use with many of the former Yugoslav successor states. The most recent modification is the Russian PKP Pecheneg, which features a forced air cooling barrel and longer barrel life up to 10,000 rounds.

<text>A dropper is a Trojan horse that has been designed to install malware (such as viruses and backdoors) onto a computer. The malware within the dropper can be packaged to evade detection by antivirus software. Alternatively, the dropper may download malware to the target computer once activated.

Droppers can be categorized into two types: persistent and non-persistent. Persistent droppers conceal themselves on the device and alter system registry keys. Concealment allows them to reinstall the malware during a reboot, even if previously removed. Non-persistent droppers are considered less dangerous as they remove themselves from the system after executing their payload. Thus, once the malware is removed, it cannot reinstall itself.

Trojan horses operate by masquerading as legitimate programs, requiring user interaction to execute. They unpack and load malicious code into the computer&#x27;s memory, then install malicious software (malware).

Precautions can be taken to prevent infection from malware droppers. For example, not opening links from unknown sources and only downloading software from known verified distributors, such as the Microsoft Store or the Apple App Store. Also, a firewall can block traffic from unverified sources.
Droppers can also target mobile devices. For instance, a user might download an application via a text message link, which leads to the device being infected with malware. An example of a Trojan dropper created for mobile devices is the Sharkbot dropper. It facilitates unauthorized financial transactions by exploiting the Automatic Transfer Service (ATS), allowing attackers to siphon funds from mobile banking applications. This type of malware typically enters devices through sideloading, bypassing official app stores.

<text>Orford Castle is a castle in Orford in the English county of Suffolk, northeast of Ipswich, with views over Orford Ness. It was built between 1165 and 1173 by Henry II of England to consolidate royal power in the region. The well-preserved keep, described by historian R. Allen Brown as &quot;one of the most remarkable keeps in England&quot;, is of a unique design and probably based on Byzantine architecture. The keep stands within the earth-bank remains of the castle&#x27;s outer fortifications.

==History==

===12th century===
The honour of Eye was a landholding that included Orford and at various points was under royal control. In 1156, Henry II granted the honour to Lord Chancellor Thomas Becket and confiscated it in 1162 when the then Archbishop of Canterbury came into conflict with the king and fled to France. Prior to the building of Orford Castle, Suffolk was dominated by the Bigod family, who held the title of the Earl of Norfolk and owned key castles at Framlingham, Bungay, Walton and Thetford. Hugh Bigod had been one of a group of dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and Henry II wished to re-establish royal influence across the region. Henry confiscated the four castles from Hugh, but returned Framlingham and Bungay to Hugh in 1165. Henry then decided to build his own royal castle at Orford, near Framlingham, and construction work began in 1165, concluding in 1173. The Orford site was around from the sea, lying on flat ground with swampy terrain slowly stretching away down to the river Ore, about away. The construction of Orford Castle may also have been motivated by the prospect Becket&#x27;s return from exile in France with armed support.

The design of the keep was unique, and has been termed &quot;one of the most remarkable keeps in England&quot; by historian R. Allen Brown. The central tower was circular in cross-section with three rectangular, clasping towers built out from the structure. The tower was based on a precise set of proportions, its various dimensions following the one-to-the-root-of-two ratio found in many English churches of the period. Much of the interior is built with high-quality ashlar stonework, with broad, staircases. The best chambers were designed to catch the early morning sun, whilst the various parts of the keep were draught-proofed with doors and carefully designed windows. Originally the roof of the keep, above the upper hall, would have formed a domed effect, with a tall steeple above that. The chapel above the entrance to the keep was unusually shaped; historian Stephen Brindle suggests that such a design &quot;would not normally have been thought seemly for a room dedicated to the service of God&quot;.

The keep was surrounded by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey; these outer defences, rather than the keep, probably represented the main defences of the castle. The marshes nearby were drained, turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port. The castle, including the surrounding ditch, palisade and stone bridge, cost £1,413 to build, the work possibly being conducted by the master mason Alnoth. Some of the timbers were brought from as far away as Scarborough, and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy, the remainder of the stone being variously local mudstone and coralline, as well as limestone from Northamptonshire.

The design of the keep has attracted much historical interest. Traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that the castle was a transitional military design, combining both the circular features of later castles with the square angled buttresses of earlier Norman fortifications. More recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation. The design of the Orford keep is hard to justify in military terms, as the buttresses created additional blind spots for the defenders, whilst the chambers and staircase in the corners weakened the walls against attack. Square Norman keeps continued to be built after Orford, whilst Henry II was aware of fully circular castle designs before building the keep. A round keep was constructed at New Buckenham, Norfolk, in 1146, for example. Historians have therefore questioned to what extent the design can be seen as legitimately transitional. Instead, historians now believe that the design of Orford Castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism. Architectural historian Sandy Heslop argues that the plain, simple elegance of the architecture would, for mid-12th-century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur, who was then widely believed to have had Roman or Greek links. The banded, angular features of the keep resembled the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power, and the keep as a whole, including the roof, may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in Constantinople by John II Komnenos.

===13th to 19th centuries===

By the start of the 13th century, royal authority over Suffolk had been firmly established, after Henry II crushed the Bigods in the revolt of 1173–1174, Orford being heavily garrisoned during the conflict, with 20 knights being based there. Upon the collapse of the rebellion, Henry ordered the permanent confiscation of Framlingham Castle. The political importance of Orford Castle diminished after Henry&#x27;s death in 1189, although the port of Orford grew in importance, however, handling more trade than the more famous port of Ipswich by the beginning of the century.

The castle was captured by Prince Louis of France who invaded England in 1216 at the invitation of the English barons who were disillusioned with King John. John Fitz-Robert became the governor of the royal castle under the young Henry III, followed by Hubert de Burgh. Under Edward I governorship of the castle was given to the de Valoines family, and it passed by marriage to Robert de Ufford, the 1st Earl of Suffolk, who was granted it in perpetuity by Edward III in 1336. The Uffords modernised the castle, adding glass to the windows and installing wood panelling in various rooms. Despite these changes to make Orford more comfortable, Brindle suggests the earl and his family would only have used the castle occasionally as earl&#x27;s large household would have needed more space. No longer a royal castle, Orford was passed on through the Willoughby, Stanhope and Devereux families, whilst the surrounding economy of Orford went into decline. The estuary of the River Ore silted up and the Orford Ness spit increased, making the harbour access more difficult, resulting in a decline in trade, reducing the importance of the castle as the centre of local government.

The castle descended to Michael Stanhope, who commissioned John Norden to carry out a survey of his family&#x27;s estates. The earliest surviving depiction of the castle dates from this survey. Stanhope built a new home at Sudbourne in 1604 and 1605, and in doing so probably reused stone from Orford Castle.
The castle and surrounding lands were bought by the Seymour-Conway family in 1754. By the late 18th century only the north wall of the bailey survived and the roof and upper floors of the keep had badly decayed, and Francis Seymour-Conway, the 2nd Marquess of Hertford, proposed destroying the building in 1805. He was prevented from doing so by the government, on the grounds that the keep formed a valuable landmark for ships approaching from Holland, wishing to avoid the nearby sandbanks. Francis&#x27;s son, also called Francis, undertook conservation efforts in 1831, installing a new, relatively flat, lead roof and a replacement upper floor. Francis furnished the top of the keep for use as an apartment by guests. By the 1840s, however, all of the surrounding bailey wall and mural towers had almost vanished, having been quarried for stone, and the foundations could only just be seen.

===Modern period===

Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928 and gave the property to the Orford Town Trust; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards. In 1930 the castle opened to the public. During the Second World War the castle was refortified with barbed wire to form what was originally intended to be an anti-aircraft emplacement, with Nissen huts erected around the keep. The castle was instead used as a radar emplacement, and a concrete floor was installed in the south-east tower to support the equipment. These buildings were removed at the end of the conflict. The Ministry of Information took a series of propaganda photographs around Orford dubbed &quot;Invasion Village&quot;; as well as showing life in the village, the images contrasted the old fortification with new defences to demonstrate that heritage was under threat.

Orford Castle was given to the Ministry of Works in 1962, and is now maintained by English Heritage. The first guidebook to the site was published two years later, written by R. Allen Brown. Later guidebooks were written by Derek Renn (1988), John Rhodes (2003), and Stephen Brindle (2018).

The keep of the castle is the only part of the structure remaining intact, although the earthwork remains of the bailey wall are still visible. Some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks are not medieval but results of later quarrying of the bailey walls. Archaeological work to interpret the surrounding environment has continued, most recently during 2002 to 2003. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.

The finale of the 1968 film &quot;Witchfinder General&quot; was shot in the castle. The filmmakers were required to shoot at night because the Ministry of Works said that they were mandated to keep it open to the public during the day.

While maintained by English Heritage, the castle also houses Orford Museum. The museum moved into the castle in 2005, and is housed in the upper hall. It had been without a venue since 1998. The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in there featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally.

In the 21st century, English Heritage began a programme of conservation to stem the decay of the mudstone, also known as septaria, used to build the castle. The stone had been weathering since at least the 16th century, and in 2008 English Heritage began trialling different means of preserving the stone. After various trials, in 2022 a £1 million project was undertaken to cover the castle in lime render.

==Wild Man of Orford==
Orford Castle is associated with the legend of the Wild Man of Orford. According to the chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, a naked wild man, covered in hair, was caught in the nets of local fishermen around 1167. The man was brought back to the castle where he was held for six months, being questioned or tortured. He said nothing and behaved in a feral fashion throughout. The wild man finally escaped from the castle. Later accounts described him as a merman, and the incident appears to have encouraged the growth in &quot;wild men&quot; carvings on local baptismal fonts—around twenty such fonts from the later medieval period exist in coastal areas of Suffolk and Norfolk, near Orford.
