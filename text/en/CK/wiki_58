<text>The Goodyear 400 is a NASCAR Cup Series race held at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina. A race was held in May at the track in 1952, however the event did not become a regular one on the NASCAR schedule until 1957, as a race in the Convertible Division, then known as the Rebel 300. In 1966, the race was expanded to , and in 1973 to . In 1994, the race was relegated again to 400 miles. For a time, the race was held on or around Confederate Memorial Day, which is observed on May 10 in the state of South Carolina.

In 2005, as part of the settlement of the Ferko lawsuit and as part of a schedule realignment, Darlington was forced to give up one of its two races; the 400-mile race was dropped, with the fall Southern 500 taking its date before eventually moving back to its traditional Labor Day date in 2015.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NASCAR announced it would be running two Darlington races in May (the fall Southern 500 date still stood), replacing the Chicagoland Speedway event and the Richmond Raceway spring race and also marking the return of spring Darlington racing. The track hosted a 400-mile race called The Real Heroes 400 on Sunday, May 17 (which was also the track&#x27;s first scheduled day race since 2004) followed by a 500-kilometer race called the Toyota 500 on Wednesday, May 20.

On September 30, 2020, it was announced in a press conference at the South Carolina Governor&#x27;s Mansion with Henry McMaster, Lesa Kennedy, and Darlington Raceway officials that after the success of the spring races in 2020, Darlington would receive a permanent second Cup date on the 2021 schedule and that it would be held on Mother&#x27;s Day (May 9) in 2021 as part of a massive schedule realignment. The event would be a 400-miler just like The Real Heroes 400 in May 2020, and it would also become the throwback weekend for all three national series instead of the track&#x27;s Labor Day weekend races. Goodyear, the official tire of NASCAR, would be the title sponsor for the spring Darlington race.

==Notable races==
*1960: Johnny Allen goes up the race track and tears open the guardrail and then driving on the dirt banking on the outside of the track into a press grandstand. No one was seriously injured.
*1970: Richard Petty hit the outside wall hard and then the inside wall even harder, causing his car to flip. The rag Petty would put in his mouth came out, and was mistaken by ABC as a gruesome death. Petty was seriously injured, but survived. During the roll, Petty&#x27;s head hit the track surface several times, causing NASCAR to mandate the use of the Petty-developed window nets. These remain in use today.
*1975: The finish shook into a bizarre sequence. In the final twenty laps Benny Parsons and David Pearson went after the lead; they raced side by side into Turn One and hammered the wall. Bobby Allison, who&#x27;d been a lap down, unlapped himself and raced into the lead with Darrell Waltrip and Donnie Allison hot on his heels. Bobby led them to the win, his second of the season and first at Darlington since 1972.
*1977: A crash with five laps to go set up a wild finish. Darrell Waltrip shot past Bobby Allison, who was driving in relief of his brother Donnie, and Richard Petty charged into the fray; they hit the line three abreast and Waltrip was declared the winner as the final laps ran under caution.
*1979: In a race that was seen on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;, Darrell Waltrip and Richard Petty hooked horns in a memorable duel. The lead changed four times between them on Lap 365 and three times on the final lap; Waltrip prevailed over Petty when he cleared Petty in Turn Three and Donnie Allison tried to shoot the gap, instead getting hung alongside Petty. During the race, David Pearson made a pit stop, and thought the Wood brothers were going to change only two tires. With the lug nuts loosened all the way around, Pearson sped out of the pits after two tires had been replaced. The loose inside wheels flew off near the pit road, ending Pearson&#x27;s day. A week later, Pearson and the Wood Brothers split, despite scoring 43 wins from 1972 to 1978 with the Virginia-based team.
*1980: David Pearson was now driving for Hoss Ellington Racing&#x27;s #1 car, replacing Donnie Allison for the 1980 season. Despite the fact that the race was plagued by constant rain, and incoming darkness (the track did not have lights installed until the 2004 Southern 500, which finished after darkness), Pearson dominated the race and won after the race was called five laps after it was an official race with 189 complete. However, this would be Pearson&#x27;s 105th and final Cup Win, and his 10th at Darlington in his storied career.
*1981: Darrell Waltrip beat Harry Gant by a car length for his third Rebel 500 win in the event&#x27;s previous five runnings, while Gant finished second in his debut ride in a #33 Pontiac with car owners Hal Needham and Burt Reynolds.
*1982: Dale Earnhardt, driving Bud Moore&#x27;s #15 Ford, grabbed the first of nine Darlington wins when he led 181 laps but had to hold off a last-lap challenge from Cale Yarborough. Tim Richmond finished a lap down in fifth after a NASCAR penalty on pit road; Richmond was making his debut in Jim Stacy&#x27;s #2.
*1984: Darrell Waltrip led 251 laps as crashes galore thinned out the field. The crashing began when pole-sitter Benny Parsons hit the second-turn wall on the first lap; later there were back-to-back four-car crashes, and halfway through the race a multicar melee erupted involving Rusty Wallace, Dick Brooks, and D.K. Ulrich where Ulrich climbed another car; some 28 of 38 entries were involved in crashes.
*1987: Bill Elliott ran out of fuel on the final lap, and coasted out of turn 4, allowing Dale Earnhardt to sweep by and take the victory. Two vicious crashes erupted; in one Terry Labonte was injured ion a hard hit by a spinning Ricky Rudd, while later rookie Davey Allison hit a guardrail and his Ford&#x27;s fuel cell erupted in flame.
*1988: Lake Speed escaped a multicar wreck in the opening laps and breezed to one of the sport&#x27;s most dramatic upset wins. It was his only Sprint Cup win.
*1990: Dale Earnhardt took the win, but the story of the race was a massive accident between Ernie Irvan and Ken Schrader; Irvan was ten laps down yet racing nose-to-nose with Schrader as if for the lead, and lost control in Four; several cars collided in the ensuring melee and Sterling Marlin spun off the wall and hammered Neil Bonnett; Bonnett suffered severe memory loss and was lost for three seasons as a driver.
*1994: Dale Earnhardt became the 6th driver in NASCAR History to score 60 career NASCAR Cup Series wins. This was Dale&#x27;s 1st win of the 1994 season, and this win would lead him to the record tying 7th Winston Cup Championship. This would be Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s 9th and final Darlington win, and as of today, his 9 wins place him 2nd all-time to David Pearson&#x27;s 10 wins.
*2003: Before a national television audience, Ricky Craven and Kurt Busch fought a memorable duel that came down to the final turn, when Craven edged out Busch by 0.002 seconds (about 1-2 inches) in the joint closest finish in NASCAR history since NASCAR started using electronic transponders to determine scoring (along with the Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega in Spring 2011).
*2020: The two races, held May 17 and 20, were the first Cup Series events since March 8 (at Phoenix) because of the COVID-19 pandemic that led to a 72-day suspension of motorsport. The race operated under heavy restrictions to follow social distancing guidelines, including being behind closed doors, a team limit of 16, and without practice or qualifying. Kevin Harvick won the race, his second Darlington win and 50th career Cup Series win.

==Past winners==
*1957: Race postponed due to rain.
*1957–1962: Race was for convertibles.
*1963: Two 150-mile race format similar to motocross, best average score wins. Weatherly won the first race, Richard Petty won the second race. Weatherly (1/2) won the Rebel 300 with best overall finish.
*2020: Two races held on same week due to COVID-19 pandemic. The May 20 event was scheduled for a 500km race.
*1980, 1999, &amp; 2020 II: Race shortened due to rain.
*2023: Race extended due to a NASCAR overtime finish.

<doc id="1135751" wikidata="Q1172693" url="?curid=1135751" title="Datsun Sports">
<text>The Datsun Sports (called Datsun Fairlady in the Japanese and Australian markets and simply given a numerical designation alone in other export markets), was a series of roadsters produced by Nissan in the 1960s. The series was a predecessor to the Z-car in the Fairlady line, and offered a competitor to the European MG, Triumph, Fiat and Alfa Romeo sports cars. Beginning with the 1959 S211, the line was built in two generations: the first generation was largely handbuilt in small numbers, while the second generation (310 series) was series produced. The second generation first appeared in 1961 and continued through 1970 with the SP311 and SR311 lines.

In Japan, it represented one of three core products offered by Nissan at Japanese Nissan dealerships, called Nissan Shop, alongside the Datsun Truck and the Bluebird (1000). The second generation Fairlady, called the Datsun 2000 in export, was the two-seat roadster that made their name, fitted with a potent 1,982 cc overhead cam engine with dual SU type side draft carbs and a five-speed transmission. Actor Paul Newman started his racing career in one.


==First generation==
===S211===
The first Datsun Sports model was the 1959 S211. It used a 988 cc C-series straight-4 producing . The S211 was based on the Datsun 211 sedan. Incorporated into the side trim were the side badges, which said &quot;Datsun 1000&quot;. It was designed by Yuichi Ohta, who had previously designed the Datsun DC-3 and the prototype to the S211, the A80X. Both the A80X and S211 featured fiberglass bodywork, influenced by the Chevrolet Corvette. Only 20 examples of the S211 were built, making the S211 the rarest of all Datsun models.

===SPL212/SPL213 ===

The SPL212 was introduced in 1960. This was the first Datsun sports car imported to the US. The letter &quot;L&quot; means &quot;left hand drive&quot;. Now with steel bodywork, it was built in slightly higher volume than the S211, with 288 produced through 1961. The SPL212 was based on the Datsun 223 truck. It had a 1.2 L (1189 cc) E-series straight-4 engine producing . A 4-speed manual transmission was specified, and an a-arm suspension with torsion bars was used in front. Drum brakes were used all around. This was the first vehicle to bear the &quot;Fairlady&quot; name. The badge on the trunk lid was the same badge that was used on the Datsun 223 truck. It was named in reference to the Broadway musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. The SPL212 and later SPL213 were sold only on the export market; they were named for their engine displacement. In 1960, production of the Fairlady was moved from Yokohama to the Nissan Shatai plant in Hiratsuka.

These cars are quite valuable. In 1996 a set of unrestored cars (SPL212) sold for US$100,000.

The SPL213, produced in 1961 and 1962, is very similar to the SPL212. The main difference is the dual-carburetor &quot;E-1&quot; engine which pumped out , a large increase in such a small and light car. Like the SPL212, the SPL213 was based on the Datsun 223 truck. 217 examples were built.

== Second generation==
The second generation Fairlady made its debut at the Tokyo Motor show in 1961, several months before the roll-out of the similar looking MGB. The second generation was designed for mass production, unlike the mostly handbuilt original model. It was sold as the Datsun 1500/1600/2000 Roadster in most export markets. Particularly the 1600 and 2000 Roadsters became regular winners on the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) circuit, winning 10 national SCCA championships. The 1600 and 2000 were produced until 1970 when they were superseded by the 240Z.

===SP310/SPL310 ===
The first true Datsun sports car was the 1963 SP310 &quot;Fairlady 1500&quot; model (right hand drive), and the SPL310 (left hand drive). In America it was known as the Datsun 1500. The SP310 was based on a modified Bluebird 310 sedan platform instead of the truck platform of earlier models. It featured a 1.5 L (1,497 cc) &quot;G15&quot; OHV engine (from the Cedric) but with a single SU carburettor and . After the first 300 SPL310&#x27;s had been built, a dual SU carb models with was introduced for 1964 and 1965. A four-speed manual transmission was the only shifting option and has a non-syncro&#x27;d first gear. The rear axle used the shafts and differential also from the Cedric. It was a well-equipped car with a transistor radio, tonneau cover, map lights, and a clock. The first SP310s (1963–1964) were three-seaters, with a unique transverse single seat in the rear and buckets in front. The final revision of the 1500 model occurred in 1965 with a completely redesigned interior which eliminated the back seat and introduced a more sporty dash layout.

;Marketing
To coincide with the 1964 Summer Olympics, Nissan established the gallery on the second and third floors of the San-ai building, located in Ginza, Tokyo. To attract visitors, Nissan started using beautiful female showroom attendants where Nissan held a competition to choose five candidates as the first class of Nissan Miss Fairladys, modeled after &quot;Datsun Demonstrators&quot; from the 1930s who introduced cars. The Fairlady name was used as a link to the popular Broadway play of the era &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Miss Fairladys became the marketers of Datsun Fair Lady 1500.

===SP311/SPL311===
Many changes were made in 1965. Though the 1.5 L SP310 continued in production through January, a new 1.6 L &quot;R16&quot;-powered SP311 and SPL311 (left-hand drive) replaced it. The new model was first shown at the 1964 Tokyo Motor Show, but did not enter production until March 1965. The restyling was executed in part by Count Albrecht Goertz, who would later be involved with designing the first Fairlady Z. Marketed as the &quot;Fairlady 1600&quot;, or the Datsun Sports 1600 in many export markets including North America, it featured 14 inch wheels and minor exterior changes. The SPL311 was also known as the &quot;Roadster&quot; on the West Coast of the United States. The front suspension was independent, using coil springs over hydraulic shocks. Rear suspension was a common leaf springs design, damped with hydraulic shocks. The 1600 SPL311 came with a pair of SU carburettors. The engine produced . The R16 is an in-line four cylinder OHV engine. Early SPL311 came with a high compression engine that had three main bearings, hydraulic lifters, a cast iron block and cast iron head. Timing of the distributor could be easily adjusted to reduce pre-ignition knock and thereby tune for questionable quality gasoline. Engines in later SPL311 had 5 main bearings and this addressed a design weakness. Top speed for the SPL311 with approximately 91 octane gasoline was approximately 105 mph. The axle gearing suffered from design limitations and Datsun performance parts offered a cooling system as a retrofit. Steering used a worm gear design. The hood badge said &quot;Datsun&quot; in individual letters, the rear badge said &quot;Datsun 1600&quot;, and the side badges said &quot;Fairlady&quot; (Japanese market) or &quot;Datsun 1600&quot; (export market). The SP311 continued in production alongside the later 2000 model through April 1970.

The first Nissan Silvia coupe shared the SP311&#x27;s platform. The CSP311 Silvia had an R16 engine developing 96 hp and used a modified Fairlady chassis. The Silvia was the first car fitted with Nissan&#x27;s new R engine. The R engine was a further development of the 1,488 cc G engine.

Early in 1968 the 1600, just as the bigger 2000, was updated to meet new safety legislation. Toggle switches, a padded dashboard and padded center of the steering wheel were new inside. The door handles were changed to flush fit lifting units, while the windshield was taller with a top mounted internal rear view mirror.
===SR311/SRL311===

The introduction of the 1967 SR311 and SRL311 saw a major update. Produced from March 1967 until April 1970, the SR311 used a 2.0 L (1,982 cc) &quot;U20&quot; engine and offered a five-speed manual transmission, somewhat unexpected for a production car at the time. The first-year cars (known as &quot;half year&quot; cars) are sought as there were fewer than 1,000 produced which are unencumbered with the 1968 model year emissions and safety changes. The inline, four-cylinder U20 engine had a cast iron block and aluminum alloy head. This new SOHC engine produced, for 1968 to 1970, SAE gross in original trim. An optional Competition package included dual Mikuni/Solex carburetors and a special &quot;B&quot; model camshaft for SAE gross; the package also provided higher limit gauges and a license plate surround. In Australia there were no emission restrictions at the time and all 2.0-litre cars were fitted with the Competition package as standard.

Cars with the 2.0 litre engine in Japan were regarded as expensive, specialized, sports cars due to the annual road tax obligation.

The Datsun 2000 was lauded as a bargain sports car. It was raced by John Morton, Bob Sharp and others. Its sticker price was lowest in its class, but it won its class in C Production (Mikuni-Solex carburetors) and D-Production (Hitachi-SU carburetors) in SCCA racing on a consistent basis even after production stopped.

For the 1968 model year the entire line was updated with a new body featuring a taller integrated windshield with an integrated rear-view mirror, a padded dashboard with non-toggle switches, built-in headrests, and lifting door handles. This version was first shown at the 14th Tokyo Motor Show in October 1967 and was developed to meet the new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. In the US the engines were also fitted with new emissions controls, and the lesser 1600 continued as a companion model through the end of production. Australia had no such emission controls.
On the TV Program Wheeler Dealers, Mike Brewer bought one from Gene Winfield. Ant Anstead repaired and improved the car.

<doc id="1135759" wikidata="Q6588996" url="?curid=1135759" title="List of Major League Baseball players from Japan">
<text>A total of 81 Japanese-born players have played in at least one Major League Baseball (MLB) game. Of these players, eleven are on existing MLB rosters. The first instance of a Japanese player playing in MLB occurred in 1964, when the Nankai Hawks, a Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) team, sent three exchange prospects to the United States to gain experience in MLB&#x27;s minor league system. One of the players, pitcher Masanori Murakami, was named the California League Rookie of the Year while playing for the Fresno Giants (the San Francisco Giants&#x27; Class-A team).
Giants executives were impressed with his talent and on September 1, 1964, Murakami was promoted, thus becoming the first Japanese player to play in MLB, as well as being the first Asian player. After Murakami put up good pitching statistics as a reliever, Giants executives sought to exercise a clause in their contract with the Hawks that, they claimed, allowed them to buy up an exchange prospect&#x27;s contract. NPB officials objected, stating that they had no intention of selling Murakami&#x27;s contract to the Giants and telling them that Murakami was merely on loan for the 1964 season. After a two-month stalemate the Giants eventually agreed to send Murakami back to the Hawks after the 1965 season. This affair led to the 1967 United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement, also known as the &quot;Working Agreement&quot;, between MLB and NPB, which was basically a hands-off policy.

For thirty years Murakami was the only Japanese player to appear in an MLB game. Pitcher Hideo Nomo, with the help of agent Don Nomura, became the second Japanese player to play in MLB in 1995. Nomo, who was not yet eligible for free agency in Japan, was advised by Nomura that a &quot;voluntary retirement&quot; clause in the Working Agreement did not specify that a player wishing to play again after retiring must return to NPB. Nomo utilized this loophole to void his NPB contract with the Kintetsu Buffaloes and play in MLB. He announced his retirement from NPB in late 1994 and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers in February 1995. Nomo&#x27;s maneuver and Hideki Irabu&#x27;s later MLB contractual complications were contributing factors to a major revision of the Working Agreement in 1998 that created the posting system. Since its inception 22 Japanese players have been signed through the system, however one of these players, Shinji Mori, did not play in a single MLB game due to an injury. NPB players who have nine or more years of playing service with NPB can become international free agents and do not need to enter MLB through the posting system. The remaining Japanese players that have played in MLB have either signed as free agents or signed as amateur players. Mac Suzuki, Kazuhito Tadano, and Junichi Tazawa are the only Japanese players to have debuted in MLB without previously playing in NPB. All 30 MLB teams have had at least one Japanese player on their roster.

Japanese players have had a range of success in MLB. Twelve players have been selected to participate in the All-Star Game; Ichiro Suzuki has made the most appearances with ten. In addition to these selections, Ichiro has won several prestigious MLB awards including the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award and the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 2001, the All-Star Game MVP Award in 2007 and multiple Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards. Ichiro also holds the MLB record for the recording the most hits in a single season. Hideo Nomo was the only Japanese pitcher to throw a no-hitter until Hisashi Iwakuma accomplished the feat on August 12, 2015. Nomo threw two in total; the first came in 1996 and the last occurred in 2001.

Currently, Shohei Ohtani is the only player in MLB history to win the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award twice unanimously in 2021 and 2023, the first player in MLB history with 10 wins and 40 home runs in a season, and the first player in MLB history to be named to both first teams for the 2023 All-MLB Team in the same season (as a designated hitter and starting pitcher respectively). Ohtani is also the first Japanese-born player to hit for the cycle, the first Japanese-born player to win a major league home run title, leading the American League with 44 home runs the first Japanese-born player to win the AL Hank Aaron Award, and the first Japanese player to have the most popular Major League Baseball jersey sales. In addition, Ohtani has also won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award in 2018, two Silver Slugger Awards, and multiple Edgar Martínez Outstanding Designated Hitter Awards. Ohtani also signed the largest contract in professional sports history, a 10-year $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. while Yoshinobu Yamamoto received the most guaranteed dollars ever given to a pitcher, signing a 12-year, $325 million contract with the Dodgers.

Thirteen Japanese players have played in the World Series. Of these players, So Taguchi has won the most with two and Hideki Matsui is the only one to win the World Series MVP Award. The 2007 World Series had the most Japanese players, with Daisuke Matsuzaka and Hideki Okajima pitching for the Boston Red Sox, and Kazuo Matsui playing for the Colorado Rockies.

<text>Running the aisles is an ecstatic expression of worship that occurs occasionally in some contexts of worship in the Pentecostal and Holiness movements in Christianity. As the expression suggests, when a person runs the aisles in a worship setting, they leaves their seat and run down the aisles between seating sections or run around the interior perimeter of the meeting house.

A biblical basis for the act known as &quot;running the aisles&quot; is difficult to establish. Nevertheless, in the Pentecostal worship tradition, spontaneous expressions inspired by the moving of the Spirit are highly valued, and in many congregations the spontaneous running of aisles has traditionally been an acceptable expression of joy. Typically those Pentecostals who run the church aisles do not do so unless they feel that they are overwhelmed by the presence of the Holy Spirit at a point in the service when the congregation in general is sensing His moving.

It may be reasonable to classify running as a form of dancing. Running occurs at times in modern Jewish folk dancing.

Opponents of this expression of worship argue that it violates Paul&#x27;s instructions on orderly worship found in 1 Corinthians 14:26-40, as well as contradicting the idea that one of the &quot;fruits&quot; of the Holy Spirit is self-control (Galatians 5:23). At its basic level, however, opponents of such a belief hold a different view of the work of the Holy Spirit.

<text>Aba Bayefsky (April 7, 1923 – May 5, 2001) was an artist and teacher.

==Career==
Bayefsky was born to a Jewish family in Toronto, Ontario, the second son of a Russian-born father and a Scottish-born mother. He studied at the Central Technical School. During his teens, he attended classes at the Children&#x27;s Art Centre of the Art Gallery of Ontario, where he was encouraged by such artists as Arthur Lismer, Erma Sutcliffe, Dorothy Medhurst, and A. Y. Jackson. He later studied at the Académie Julian in Paris.

Bayefsky enlisted in the RCAF in October, 1942, and was made a Flight Lieutenant. He was appointed an Official Second World War artist in December, 1944, assigned to depict airborne operations over north-west Europe. He entered the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation and recorded what he saw in sketchbooks (these were destroyed in a fire later). But Bergen-Belsen became a part of his creative imagination. The Canadian War Museum has 9 works by Bayefsky of scenes in Bergen-Belsen.

After the war, he was an instructor at the Ontario College of Art. In 1958, he was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and in 1979, he was made a member of the Order of Canada. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Bayefsky maintained an interest in tattooing and produced a series of portraits of tattooed people from Toronto and Japan.

<doc id="1135769" wikidata="Q648653" url="?curid=1135769" title="Ukrainian Air Force">
<text>The Ukrainian Air Force (, PS ZSU) is the air force of Ukraine and one of the eight branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ZSU). Its current form was created in 2004 by merging the Ukrainian Air Defence Forces into the Air Force.

When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, many aircraft were left in Ukrainian territory. After Ukrainian independence in 1991, the air force suffered from chronic under-investment, leading to the bulk of its inventory becoming mothballed or otherwise inoperable. However its domestic defense industry Ukroboronprom and its Antonov subsidiary are able to maintain its older aircraft.

The Ukrainian Air Force participated in the war in Donbas. Following the 2014 ceasefire, the air force was suspended from carrying out missions in the areas of Donbas. Since February 2022, the Air Force has been engaged in constant combat operations in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The air force flies F-16 multirole jetfighters and Soviet-made aircraft.

==Missions==
The role of the Air Force is to protect the air space of Ukraine. The objectives are: obtaining operational air superiority, delivering air strikes against enemy units and facilities, covering troops against enemy air strikes, providing air support to the Ukrainian Ground Forces, Marine Corps and the Navy in wartime operations and peacetime exercises, disrupting enemy military movements on the ground, air and sea, disrupting enemy communications, and providing air support by reconnaissance, airdrops, and troop and cargo transportation in both peace and war, in support of the Armed Forces, other uniformed forces, and wider mandates of the Government of Ukraine.

In peace-time, this is carried out by flying air-space control missions over the entire territory of Ukraine (603,700 square km), and by preventing air space intrusion along the aerial borders (totaling almost 7,000 km, including 5,600 km of land and 1,400 km of sea). Over 2,200 service personnel and civilian employees of the Air Force, employing 400 items of weapons and equipment, are summoned daily to perform defense duties.

On average, the Ukrainian radar forces detect and track more than 1,000 targets daily. As a result, in 2006 two illegal crossings of the state border were prevented and 28 violations of Ukrainian air space were prevented. Due to such increased strengthening of air space control, the number of air space violations decreased by 35% compared to the previous year, even though the amount of air traffic increased by 30%.

== History ==

=== 1917–1945 ===
Ukrainian military aviation started with the winter 1917 creation of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic Air Fleet, headed by former commander of the Kyiv Military District Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Pavlenko. Previously, while in Russian service in World War I, Pavlenko was in charge of air security of the Russian Stavka.

Sometime in 1918 the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic created its own aviation corps with the Ukrainian Galician Army headed by Petro Franko, a son of renowned Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko. In 1918 he organized an aviation school of the Ukrainian Galician Army Command Center which was active until 1920.

The airplanes used by Ukraine in this period included Belgium-built SPAD S.VIIs. The Ukrainian Galician Army used Nieuport 17 biplanes. At the beginning of 1918, 188 aircraft of 26 models were listed in Ukrainian registers.

During World War II, Ukrainian pilots took part in combat operations as part of the Soviet Air Force. Among these pilots, Ivan Kozhedub is notable for being the highest-scoring Allied ace with over 60 credited solo victories.

=== Collapse of the USSR ===

==== Air Forces ====
On the basis of the ex-Soviet Air Forces formations in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force, as a service branch of the young Armed Forces, was established on 17 March 1992, in accordance with a Directive of the Chief of the General Staff of the AFU. The headquarters of the 24th Air Army of the Soviet Air Force in Vinnytsia served as the basis to create the Air Force headquarters. The newly created PSZSU nominally controlled at least three Frontal Aviation Armies (5th, 14th, and 17th), the Strategic 46th Air Army, the 8th Air Defence Army including the 28th, 49th, and 60th Air Defence Corps from the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO), two Military Transport divisions, at least nine Army Aviation regiments, and a large part of the Naval Aviation of the Black Sea Fleet, for a total of 49 regiments and 11 independent squadrons with more than 2,800 aircraft and helicopters. The PSZSU also controlled the 106th Heavy Bomber Division, based at Pryluky. This division included twenty-seven Tu-95MS bombers, two obsolete Tu-95M, nineteen new Tu-160 bombers, and twenty Il-78 aerial tankers. The 160th Divison also had at least 564 Kh-22 and Kh-55 air-to-surface nuclear cruise missiles in their inventory.

After combining all its flying assets into the Air Force (though ground-based elements of the PVO remained separate as the Ukrainian Air Defence Forces until 2004), Ukraine gradually began downsizing the size of the PSZSU in order to comply with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) terms. Faced with difficulties maintaining a strategic bomber fleet, Ukraine was forced to scrap part of their bomber fleet under the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program and return some aircraft and all nuclear cruise missiles to Russia in exchange for settling debts for oil and natural gas imported from the Russian Federation.

==== Air Defence Forces ====
In 1992 the newly independent Ukrainian State took over control over the three Air Defence corps stationed in Ukraine and retained the Air Defence Forces of Ukraine as a separate armed service, equal in status to the Ground Forces, Air Forces and the Navy. The 28th Corps was transferred to the now-Ukrainian 8th Separate Army of Air Defence.

===1991–2014===

Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine launched a three-stage reform program to reform its Armed Forces. During the first stage which ran from 1991 to 2006 the ZSU shrank in size and capabilities. Corruption, already endemic in the political and economic system of the country began spreading into the ZSU, resulting in an increase of draft dodging cases and bases falling into a state of decay. Under the government of Viktor Yanukovych from 2010−2014, an armed conflict with Russian Federation was considered unthinkable, resulting in further budget cuts. By 2014, the Air Force was suffering from chronic under-investment, leading to the bulk of its inventory becoming mothballed or otherwise becoming inoperable.

In 1993, the &quot;International Institute for Strategic Studies&quot;
(IISS) estimated that the PSZSU had 171,000 personnel with 900 combat capable aircraft plus 440 in storage; 87 reconnaissance, 47 electronic countermeasure, 274 transport, 560 training fixed-wing aircraft, and 142 helicopters.

Between 1994 and 2003 the entire fleet of 60 Tu-22M2 and Tu-22M3 with the exception of a few aircraft preserved for display in local museums, were scrapped alongside 423 Kh-22 cruise missiles. By 1995−96, the MiG-23, MiG-25, and Su-15 interceptors were withdrawn from service. While Ukraine was less than keen on returning its fleet of strategic bombers to Russia &quot;since they could be used in roles other than nuclear attack&quot;, the PSZSU was soon unable to keep the fleet operational with Russia refusing to sell spare parts, forcing the Ukrainian government to start negotiating the possible sale of the aircraft back to Russia, but as talks dragged on, their condition seriously deteriorated. Starting in November 1998, some of the older aircraft began to be scrapped with American funding (with a few examples preserved as local museum exhibitions) and in October 1999, Ukraine finally agreed to return eight Tu-160s, three Tu-95MS&#x27;s (out of nineteen Tu-160s and twenty-three Tu-95MS), and 575 Kh-55MS nuclear cruise missiles to settle debts for oil and natural gas imported from the Russian Federation. 

During the second stage of reforming the ZSU, which ran from 2006 to 2014, Ukraine was supposed to (at least on paper) move from the old Soviet model of fielding large formations into a smaller, fully trained and equipped professional force, taking advantage of new technologies such as digitalization, precision-guided munitions and sensors, and command and control infrastructure. However by 2014, it became clear that such plans were beyond the capabilities of the Ukrainian state to fund and implement, resulting in the PSZSU (and other branches of the Armed Forces) being unprepared for the War in Donbas. Between 2006 and 2017, Ukraine sold as many as 65 combat jets (Su-27s, Su-25s, Su-22s, MiG-29s, and MiG-21s), 41 L-39s trainers, six An-72, An-74, and An-12 military transports, three Il-78 tankers, 50 Tu-143 reconnaisance drones, 44 Mi-24 attack helicopters and 802 missiles of various types (R-24, R-27, R-73 air-to-air missiles and Kh-59 air-to-surface cruise missiles).

By 2010, the Air Force was reduced to 45,240 personnel (down from 96,000 in 2002). Formations included seven brigades with 188 combat aircraft; two reconnaissance squadrons operated thirty-three Su-24MRs; three transport brigades with 31 aircraft (An-24, An-26, Tu-134, and Il-76); an helicopter fleet with 38 Mi-9s, Mi-8s, and Mi-2s. While only thirty-nine L-39s were available for training compared to 300 operational in 2002.

Some upgrade programs were carried to overhaul and upgrade the PSZSU fleet of fighters and fighter-bombers. In 2008, 12 Su-25s were upgraded to the Su-25M1K standard. In 2011, the Air Force received its first four upgraded MiG-29MU1s with assistance from Rockwell Collins. From 2012 onwards, the MiGremont company started working on upgrading Su-27 to the Su-27M1 standard. However due the lack of funds, only part of the fleet was upgraded prior to February 2014.

===Role in the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine===
In 2014 the PSZSU was reduced to 144 aircraft, but only two-thirds were operational at the time. Due the poor condition of several of their aircraft, some units were severely understrength (for example, the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade had only 10 operational Su-24M and MRs in February that year).
Despite its poor condition, the Air Force operated intensively in the Donbas region, inflicting heavy casualties on the pro-Russian insurgents, albeit at a heavy cost. During the first four months of the War in Donbas alone, the Ukrainian Air Force and Ukrainian Army Aviation lost four Mi-24 gunships, two Mi-8 helicopters, six Su-25s, three transport aircraft and four strike and air-superiority fighters. In total, 20 aircraft were shot down or lost in accidents, 126 were captured by the Russians after their air bases in Crimea were seized; while 51 servicemen of the PSZSU were killed including 16 pilots from February to early September 2014. Ukraine later managed to secure the return of 92 of the captured aircraft.

While the Russians made ample use of drones since the start of the conflict for observation and fire control, Ukraine had very few drones in early 2014. In fact, the Air Force operated none at all. In August 2014, the PSZSU began employing restored Tu-141 and Tu-143 reconnaissance drones, while citizens and supporters from abroad (specially the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada) launched crowdfunded initiatives to buy or build reconnaissance drones for the ZSU.

After the ZSU was defeated in the Battle of Ilovaisk, Russia demanded a complete ban on the Ukrainian use of air power as a condition for the Minsk I peace agreement, though Air Command East based at Dnipropetrovsk kept two units of S-300PS surface-to-air missile batteries on standby against potential Russian airstrikes.

===Developments towards restoration (2014−2021)===
Starting in 1993 the United States National Guard worked with the Ukrainian Air Force as part of a NATO sponsored program. The Ukrainian Air Force worked with the California Air National Guard&#x27;s 144th Fighter Wing and pilots exercised together, including in 2011 and 2018. 

In response to the Russian annexation of Crimea and the insurgency in the Donbas region, Ukraine attempted to obtain a license to produce the Saab JAS 39 Gripen locally as well purchase Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano training aircraft, but due budgetary constraints, talks were cancelled in August 2014. Immediately after, Kyiv issued order No. 499 allocating funds to restore and upgrade as many Soviet-era fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters as possible. Such effort was possible thanks to clandestine purchases of spare parts abroad. Also Ukraine, a former hub of the Soviet aerospace industry, inherited hundreds of factories including: Konotop Aircraft Repair Plant (AVIAKON), Lviv State Aviation Repair Plant (LSARP or LDARZ), Nikolaev (Mykolaiv) Aircraft Repair Plant (NARP), Zaporizhzhia State Aircraft Repair Plant (ZDARZ, also known as &quot;MiGremont&quot;), Odessa Aircraft Plant (ODARZ, aka &quot;Odessaviaremservis&quot;), and the Lutsk Repair Plant Motor. Additionally, the Air Force also received enough funding to reactivate former air bases at Kanatove, Voznesensk, Velykyi Buialyk, and Artsyz.

Since 2014, the PSZSU also worked on restoring several SAM systems kept in storage, including the S-300V. In August 2014 the Air Force received enough funding to reactivate 68 Soviet vintage Tu-141 and Tu-143 reconnaissance drones. While in 2019, Kyiv received its first batch of six Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey. By 2022, 36 were operational with the Air Force and Navy.

In 2019 spending on the PSZSU reached ₴8.3 billion (US$320 million), allowing the gradual resumption of regular practice flights, though according to Cooper, the leftover Soviet flight regulations and bureaucratic red tape prevented pilots from effectively putting into practice new tactics learned from NATO pilots during joint exercises.

In 2020, the &quot;Kyiv Post&quot; reported that Ukraine planned on fully replacing its fleet of Soviet combat jets with 72−108 Western multirole combat aircraft (such as the Gripen E/F or F-16 Block 70/72); fully replace its Ilyushin and Antonov transport and L-39 Albatros trainer aircraft with unspecified types; and creating a force of attack and reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles by 2035. Kyiv also planned on fully replacing its Soviet SAM systems with modern systems including the NASAMS, SAMP-T and MIM-104 Patriot in the next 15 years. The total cost of this project was estimated as ₴320 billion (US$ 12 billion) over a period of 15 years (over 38 times the budget of PSZSU in 2019).

Prior to February 2022, the Air Force was equipped with a fleet of partially upgraded old aircraft (with the newest airframes being 30 years old) and inferior weaponry in comparison to their Russian counterparts; while its personnel were plagued by low salaries, poor living conditions, and insufficient annual flying hours per pilot, barely enough to maintain proficiency. Another problem for the PSZSU was a shortage of qualified pilots, with only 10−15 cadets graduating from the Ivan Kozhedub National University of the Air Force in Kharkiv every year, while hundreds of pilots abandoned service or retired between 2020 and 2021.

=== Role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
On the morning of 24 February 2022, most of the Ukrainian air defense crews were on their bases, while a handful were on training duties when the Russians launched a barrage of at least 160 ballistic and cruise missiles (Kh-101, Kh-555, 3M54 Kalibr, and 9K720 Iskander) and anti-radiation missiles (Kh-31, Kh-58) as well, hitting at least 83 ground targets including 11 air bases, 19 air defense radar systems and 39 &quot;other&quot; radar stations while up to 22 S-300 launchers and 17 launchers for other SAM systems knocked down during the first 48 hours of the Russian &quot;special military operation&quot;. With communications from the headquarters in Vinnytsia cut off by a Russian cyberattack a day earlier, local commanders were forced to act independently in face of the enemy onslaught, with pilots quickly taking off and scattering to avoid incoming missiles, ground crews being hastily evacuated and start repairing as much remaining equipment as possible.

On 24 February 2022, the PSZSU had 116 operational combat aircraft (MiG-29s, Su-27s, Su-25s, and Su-24Ms) according to &quot;Business Insider&quot;. In March 2022, Ukraine still had about 55 operational combat aircraft according to David Deptula, senior scholar at the United States Air Force Academy.

In April 2022, the Pentagon stated that Ukraine not only managed to maintain its fleet of fixed-wing aircraft, but also repair damaged aircraft after receiving spare parts and equipment through the United States&#x27; coordination and provision, with a senior US defence official claiming that about 20 aircraft were restored to operational status. On 19 September, US Air Force General James B. Hecker said that Ukrainian air defences had shot down 55 Russian warplanes since the start of the invasion. He credited this success to the Ukrainian use of Buk and S-300 air defence systems. As the US doesn&#x27;t have these systems getting new missiles from European allies was a &quot;big ask&quot; from Kyiv. Russian airplanes increased their operations due to the 2022 Ukrainian Kharkiv Oblast counteroffensive. The tally went to 55 after the British Ministry of Defence stated that it believed that some 4 Russian jets had been downed by Ukraine over the previous 10 days. This was due to a number of factors including changing front lines, or the fact that they were under pressure to provide closer ground support. He further claimed that the Ukrainian Air Force was at about 80% of its pre-invasion strength after 7 months of combat.

In May 2023 the &quot;BBC&quot; interviewed several Ukrainian Air Force pilots. Even with MiG-29s supplied from Slovakia and Poland these are still old, with the same Soviet era equipment and radars as their own Ukrainian aircraft. When long range radar guided missiles, such as the R-37M, are fired by Russian aircraft Ukrainian pilots have to rely on ground radar to warn them verbally. Once a launch is detected pilots must abandon their mission and fly extremely low. Another pilot said that his radar cannot see cruise missiles, so they can&#x27;t be shot down. Most of the pilots fly extremely low during attack missions. When they are in action they use Soviet era unguided bombs and rockets. Due to these limitations one pilot estimates that &quot;they [Ukrainian pilots] carry out up to 20 times fewer sorties than the Russian Air Force.&quot;

As of 4 August 2023, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; the Ukrainian Air Force lost seven aircraft, &quot;four MiG-29s, an Su-24, an Su-25 and an Su-27&quot;. The reduced rate of loss, compared to reported 62 aircraft in 2022, is credited to longer range western weapons.

According to leaked US intelligence documents from February and March 2023, Ukraine stocks of missiles for their Soviet SAM systems are running low due the constant barrage of Russian missiles and drones aimed at critical infrastructure and civilian targets, forcing commanders to choose which targets can be shot down or not. To address this issue, the US and allies began providing Ukraine with a large range of air defense systems, from truck-mounted guns to Patriot batteries.
In May 2023, a Patriot of the PSZSU in the Kharkiv Oblast reportedly shot down a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber, a Su-35 fighter, and three Mi-8 helicopters in the Bryansk Oblast. In December Ukrainian Patriots or S-300s were used to shoot down three Su-34s in a single engagement in the occupied Southern Ukraine. A month later Ukrainian SAMs shot down a Beriev A-50 early warning aircraft flying over the Sea of Azov. According to a US Army officer, a German-supplied Patriot was used to ambush the A-50. On 23 February 2024, a second A-50 was shot down by a S-200 SAM in Krasnodar Krai. On 19 April 2024, a Russian Tu-22M3 bomber was shot down in Stavropol Krai with a S-200 missile according to the chief of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, Lt. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov.

Some American officers told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that Ukraine used a Patriot missile to shoot down a Russian Il-76 transport in the Belgorod Oblast on 24 January 2024, allegedly killing everyone onboard. According to Ukrainian claims the plane was carrying S-300 missiles, while Russia claimed it was carrying 65 Ukrainain prisoners of war. Sources told the &quot;NYT&quot; that at least some of the passengers were POWs. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, some of the Ukrainian prisoner names that were listed as passengers were already exchanged.

After receving its first F-16s in August 2024, they have been mostly used on the defensive role, shooting down Russian cruise missiles, with the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces stating that: &quot;In the course of air combat, F-16 aircraft demonstrated their high effectiveness, [and] with [their on-board] weapons shot down four enemy cruise missiles&quot;. On 29 August 2024, an ex-Danish F-16 piloted by Lt. Col. Oleksii Mes crashed, killing him. 

On 7 January 2025, the Ukrainian Air Force Command claimed that an unnamed F-16 pilot managed to shoot down six cruise missiles with air-to-air missiles and cannon fire during a Russian missile strike on the morning of 13 December 2024.

On 16 January 2025, the PSZSU launched an investigation on whether key personnel are being redeployed to reinforce the Eastern Front, following allegations that MiG-29 maintenance crews were sent as infantry affecting the combat readiness of the fleet. According to reports from &quot;The Kyiv Independent&quot; and &quot;Militarnyi&quot;, thousands of Air Force personnel including aviation, anti-aircraft, and radio engineering crews, were transferred to the Ground Forces since 2024 following a January 11th directive from Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi ordering the transfer of 5,000 personnel from the Air Force to the Ground Forces, while the General Staff of the Armed forces of Ukraine denied such allgations.

===Re-equipping developments (2022−Present)===

As of August 2023, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Ukraine lost 69 aircraft since February 2022, but they have been receiving equipment and funding from other countries, including 27 MiG-29G and MiG-29AS figther jets donated from Poland and Slovakia, while the Air Force has been able to restore some grounded Su-27s back to service. In January of that year, the PSZSU began preparing infrastructure to allow the operation of Western fighter jets such as the F-16, improving the quality of operating areas and possibly lengthening runways. In April 2023, photographic evidence showed that the PSZSU managed to restore at least one Su-25 donated by North Macedonia to flyworthy condition and upgrade to the Su-25M1(K) standard before it joined the 299th Tactical Aviation Brigade. In February 2024, the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade commander Col. Yevhen Bulatsyk told the &quot;Voice of America&quot; that the brigade not only managed to make up for its losses of Su-24M/MR bombers, but expand its numbers by restoring as many grounded aircraft as possible.

Ukraine has also received Western air-defense systems from allies, including the Patriot, IRIS-T, NASAMS, MIM-23 Hawk, and gun trucks to help protect its skies from missiles, fighter jets and drones.
In 2023, the Pentagon launched its &quot;FrankenSAM&quot; project which builds SAM systems capable of firing AIM-9M missiles built from parts obtained from the US, allies, and partners for Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviet Buk was modified by American engineers to fire RIM-7 missiles. Also as part of the FrankenSAM project, the US also restored and revamped retired Hawk systems. Other FrankenSAMs include 9K33 Osas modified to fire R-73 missiles and Patriot missile launchers combined with elements from existing Ukrainian air defenses, which might include radars for the S-300P.
In April 2024, a Ukrainian defense official told &quot;The War Zone&quot; that Ukraine received help from partners to provide an improved guidance system for their S-200 batteries, which were retired from service in 2013, before being reactivated during the war. &quot;The missile itself has a good maneuvering system, so if provided with proper guidance is quite a modern weapon,&quot; the official stated. According to &quot;TWZ&quot; it is possible that Ukraine may have developed mobile launchers to allow its S-200 missiles to be fired from different locations. In January 2025, Syrsky stated in an interview with &quot;TSN&quot; that Ukraine is developing its own air defense systems in response to the Russian Oreshnik ballistic missile.

In July 2023, it was reported that Ukraine Su-24 bombers were adapted to fire Storm Shadow missiles by using parts taken from Panavia Tornados retired from British service. On 24 April 2024, during the &quot;Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)&quot; annual Global Security Forum, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Dr. William LaPlante confirmed the use of iPads or similar commercial tablets by Ukrainian pilots to quickly integrate modern Western weaponry (such as AGM-88 HARM missiles, JDAM-ER and AASM Hammer glide bombs) on their Soviet-era jets. On 9 June 2024, Serhiy Golubtsov, the head of aviation within Ukraine&#x27;s Air Force Command told in an interview with &quot;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&quot; that after Ukraine exhausted its stockpiles of unguided munitions inherited from the Soviet Union and US-supplied Zuni rockets, their Su-25 attack aircraft began using French-supplied Hammer glide bombs. Golubtsov also stated that Ukraine is working on the development of domestically-produced glide bombs. 

Western allies started preparing the transfer of surplus aircraft for Ukraine including nearly 100 F-16s, some Mirage 2000-5 and a pair of Saab 340 airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft.

== Equipment ==

The last reliable information of the number of Ukrainian Air Force operational aircraft came in December 2021; during the current escalation of fighting, losses, technical refitting and donations may have changed the equipment numbers reported below.

=== Aircraft ===
As of December 2023, the amount of aircraft that are still in service, especially fighter aircraft, is uncertain. Ukraine had 43 MiG-29s, 12 Su-24s, 17 Su-25s, and 26 Su-27s in active service in 2021 according to data from &quot;Flight Global&quot;.

====F-16 procurement====
In May 2023, the United States indicated support for training Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 fighters and for allies to transfer the aircraft to Ukraine. Jets announced to be donated will be delivered to Ukraine once the Ukrainian pilots have completed their training.

Denmark will provide 19 F-16 aircraft and the Netherlands will attempt to provide up to 100% of their remaining fleet of 42 aircraft, with the exception of the aircraft required for the training of Ukrainian pilots and maintenance personnel that will take place in Denmark and Romania. Denmark aims to deliver six F-16s by April 2024, then eight F-16s in the rest of the year and five afterwards. The Netherlands committed to an initial delivery of 18 aircraft.

Norway have provided two F-16s to train Ukrainian pilots, while the total number of aircraft provided to Ukraine will be six. Belgium announced that they will send a total of 30 F-16s to Ukraine by 2028, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy stating that the first aircraft will be delivered by the end of 2024.

Greece has reportedly pledged 32 of its decommissioned F-16 aircraft to Ukraine. These aircraft will first be sent to the United States for repairs and necessary upgrades before transferring them to Ukraine.

All F-16 aircraft supplied by Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, and Belgium will be the F-16AM (single-seat) / F-16BM (twin-seat) Block 15 Mid-Life Update (MLU) variants. These variants are analogous to the F-16C/D Block 30/50/52.

As of August 2024, Ukraine has received ten F-16s, and six Ukrainian pilots have completed their training. By the end of 2024, Ukraine is expected to have twenty F-16s. The remaining jets will be delivered in batches throughout 2025.

====Mirage 2000-5 procurement====

On 6 June 2024, according to &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, French president Emmanuel Macron announced the future transfer of an unspecified number of Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Ukraine.

According to French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu, the first Mirages will be delivered in the first quarter of 2025, and they will be modernized before delivery, with new air and ground combat systems as well defenses against electronic warfare. In October 2024, it was reported that the first batch of three Mirages will be equipped with MICA missile, SCALP-EG cruise missiles, and AASM Hammer guided bombs. In November 2024, French legislator Frank Giletti stated in his budget review that six Mirage 2000-5Fs will be delivered to the UAF with a &quot;complete support model&quot; for maintenance and combat readiness.

In December 2024, Ukrainian pilots and ground crews completed their training in France. Reportedly Ukraine asked for a total of 12 Mirage 2000-5Fs to fulfill the immediate needs of the Air Force. On 6 February, Ukraine received an undisclosed number of Mirages, and ex-Dutch F-16s as well.

====Gripen procurement====

While Ukraine attempted to obtain Saab JAS 39 Gripens as early as 2014, as of November 2024 there was no indication on the transfer of the aircraft (at least on the short term), with Ukraine&#x27;s NATO allies prioritizing ongoing deliveries and support of F-16s to the PSZSU; though Sweden has earmarked spare parts (enough for 14 aircraft) for a future delivery according to Swedish Minister of Defence Pål Jonson. On 6 February 2025, Commander-in-Chief of the ZSU Oleksandr Syrskyi confirmed that negotiations on the transfer of Gripens C/D to Ukraine are still ongoing.

====Current inventory====

==Branches of the Air Force==
=== Anti-Aircraft Missile Defense Forces ===
The Anti-Aircraft Missile Defense Forces Corps were created after the 2004 merger of the Air Force and the Ukrainian Air Defense Forces. It allowed the Armed Forces of Ukraine to adopt the tri-service structure, common to most modern armed forces in the world as of present. Personnel of this force fall under the direct control of the Ukrainian Air Force General Command.

They are dedicated to anti-air defense operations in defense of air force bases and facilities and other structures of state as well as economic complexes and others as mandated by law, as well as provide support to elements of the Ground Forces, Marine Corps and Navy in combat operations.

== Structure ==
As of August 2023 the structure is as follows:

== Geographic distribution ==
==Military ranks==

===Officers===
===Other ranks and NCOs===
==Training==
Training activities have taken on a qualitatively new character due to their complexity, including the simultaneous employment of all branches of the Air Force aviation, anti-aircraft artillery and radar troops in close teamwork with units of other armed services of the Armed Forces. Operational and combat training has included the following activities:

# Aviation units have performed more than 6,000 tasks in combat scenarios (including more than 1,500 air battles and interceptions, 629 firing at land-based targets, 530 bombings, 21 launches of air missiles, 454 tasks in aerial surveillance, 454 airborne landings, 740 airlifts, 575 flight shifts for a total of 10,553 flying hours);
# Five tactical flying missions in a squadron, 14 in a pair and 5 in a flight organization have been carried out to perform the assigned combat tasks, and 54 pilots have been trained to perform specific tasks in difficult meteorological conditions;
# The number of flight crews being trained to defend the air space of the country and counter-terrorism air operations has almost doubled from 46 in 2005 to 90 in 2006; the units of anti-aircraft artillery and radar troops carried out 50 maneuvers involving redeployment, with each operator tracking 70 and 140 real and simulated targets, respectively.

In early September 2007, the Ukrainian Air Force conducted the most large-scale training of its aircraft to date. As the Defense Minister of Ukraine, Anatoliy Hrytsenko stated, &quot;The most large-scale, during the whole 16 years of the Ukrainian independence, training of fighting aircraft, which defends our air space, was carried out during September 4–5&quot;. According to him, they fulfilled 45 battle launches of air-to-air missile, out of them 22 during the day and 23 at night. 35 pilots confirmed their high skills during the training. Hrytsenko stressed that 100% of air targets were hit.

The Kharkiv State Aircraft Manufacturing Company developed the KhAZ-30 ultralight trainer for the Ukrainian Airforce. The aircraft is designed for elementary pilot training as an introductory aircraft before recruits move on the more advanced Aero L-39 Albatros trainer.

===Invasion of Ukraine===
Shooting down cruise missiles became important as the war progressed, so pilots received specialist training. The same tactics are used to intercept drones. Pilots use their infrared search and track to detect cruise missiles and drones by their heat signature. They were trained to do this using simulators. Whereas most cruise missiles fly low and are hard to detect, Russian cruise missiles leave a heat signature from their “conventional two-circuit jet engines”. President Zelenskyy singled out the 204th Tactical Aviation Brigade for praise in shooting down drones. As surface-to-air missiles run out the fighters are called upon to do more work.

<text>Spy Alley is a board game wherein each player secretly works for the spy agency of one of six countries. The players take turns moving around the board in an attempt to first gather the password, disguise, code book, and key corresponding to their country, and then reach their embassy, winning the game. But the player must beware, for any of one&#x27;s opponents may deduce and expose one&#x27;s nationality at any time, thus eliminating one from the game. This game has won several awards including: Family Life’s “Best Learing Toys of 1988”, MENSA Select Award, Parent’s Choice Award, and Games Magazine Top 100.

== How to Play ==
To determine in which order the players take their turn, each player must roll the die and whoever rolls the highest starts the game. To start, roll the die and move your token that many times, going the direction of the arrow on the start place. The other players take their turns clockwise. Each player sets out to collect their own password, disguise, code book, and key of their country without having any other player recognize their identity. To collect these items, players must land on the appropriate spaces. Once a player has collected all their appropriate items, they must land on their own embassy space to win.

<text>A refrigerator car (or &quot;reefer&quot;) is a refrigerated boxcar (U.S.), a piece of railroad rolling stock designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Refrigerator cars differ from simple insulated boxcars and ventilated boxcars (commonly used for transporting fruit), neither of which are fitted with cooling apparatus. Reefers can be ice-cooled, come equipped with any one of a variety of mechanical refrigeration systems, or use carbon dioxide (as dry ice) or liquid nitrogen as a cooling agent. Milk cars (and other types of &quot;express&quot; reefers) may or may not include a cooling system, but are equipped with high-speed trucks and other modifications that allow them to travel with passenger trains.

==History==

===Background: North America===
After the end of the American Civil War, Chicago, Illinois emerged as a major railway center for the distribution of livestock raised on the Great Plains to Eastern markets. Transporting the animals to market from ranches in Texas required herds to be driven up to to railheads in Kansas City, Missouri or later to more westerly locations, such as Abilene, Kansas (1867, Kansas Pacific Railway) and Dodge City, Kansas (1872, Santa Fe Railroad), where they were loaded into specialized stock cars and transported live (&quot;on-the-hoof&quot;) to regional processing centers. Driving cattle across the plains also caused tremendous weight loss, with some animals dying in transit.

Upon arrival at the local processing facility, livestock were slaughtered by wholesalers and delivered fresh to nearby butcher shops for retail sale, smoked, or packed for shipment in barrels of salt. Costly inefficiencies were inherent in transporting live animals by rail, particularly the fact that approximately 60% of the animal&#x27;s mass is inedible. The death of animals weakened by the long drive further increased the per-unit shipping cost. Meat processors sought a method to ship dressed meats from their Chicago packing plants to eastern markets.

===Early attempts at refrigerated transport===
During the mid-19th century, attempts were made to ship agricultural products by rail. As early as 1842, the Western Railroad of Massachusetts was reported in the June 15 edition of the &quot;Boston Traveler&quot; to be experimenting with innovative freight car designs capable of carrying all types of perishable goods without spoilage. The first refrigerated boxcar entered service in June 1851, on the Northern Railroad (New York) (or NRNY, which later became part of the Rutland Railroad). This &quot;icebox on wheels&quot; was a limited success since it was only functional in cold weather. That same year, the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad (O&amp;LC) began shipping butter to Boston in purpose-built freight cars, using ice for cooling.

====Meat====

The first consignment of dressed beef left the Chicago stock yards in 1857 in ordinary boxcars retrofitted with bins filled with ice. Placing meat directly against ice resulted in discoloration and affected the taste, proving to be impractical. During the same period Gustavus Swift experimented by moving cut meat using a string of ten boxcars with their doors removed, and made a few test shipments to New York during the winter months over the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). The method proved too limited to be practical.

Detroit&#x27;s William Davis patented a refrigerator car that employed metal racks to suspend the carcasses above a frozen mixture of ice and salt. In 1868, he sold the design to George H. Hammond, a Detroit meat packer, who built a set of cars to transport his products to Boston using ice from the Great Lakes for cooling. The load had the tendency of swinging to one side when the car entered a curve at high speed, and use of the units was discontinued after several derailments. In 1878 Swift hired engineer Andrew Chase to design a ventilated car that was well insulated, and positioned the ice in a compartment at the top of the car, allowing the chilled air to flow naturally downward. The meat was packed tightly at the bottom of the car to keep the center of gravity low and to prevent the cargo from shifting. Chase&#x27;s design proved to be a practical solution, providing temperature-controlled carriage of dressed meats. This allowed Swift and Company to ship their products across the United States and internationally.
Swift&#x27;s attempts to sell Chase&#x27;s design to major railroads were rebuffed, as the companies feared that they would jeopardize their considerable investments in stock cars, animal pens, and feedlots if refrigerated meat transport gained wide acceptance. In response, Swift financed the initial production run on his own, then — when the American roads refused his business — he contracted with the GTR (a railroad that derived little income from transporting live cattle) to haul the cars into Michigan and then eastward through Canada. In 1880 the Peninsular Car Company (subsequently purchased by ACF) delivered the first of these units to Swift, and the Swift Refrigerator Line (SRL) was created. Within a year, the Line&#x27;s roster had risen to nearly 200 units, and Swift was transporting an average of 3,000 carcasses a week to Boston, Massachusetts. Competing firms such as Armour and Company quickly followed suit. By 1920, the SRL owned and operated 7,000 of the ice-cooled rail cars. The General American Transportation Corporation would assume ownership of the line in 1930.

19th Century American Refrigerator Cars:

====Fruit and fresh produce====

In the 1870s, the lack of a practical means to refrigerate peaches limited the markets open to Samuel Rumph, a Georgia peach grower. In 1875, he invented a refrigerated railcar and crates that allowed him to grow peaches on a very large scale and ship them to distant markets. He was the first to achieve this. His innovations created Georgia&#x27;s fame for peaches, a crop now eclipsed economically by blueberries.

Edwin Tobias Earl was born on a fruit ranch near Red Bluff, California on May 30, 1858. His father was Joseph Earl, his mother Adelia Chaffee, and his brother was Guy Chaffee Earl. He started his career in the shipping of fruits. By 1886, he was President of the Earl Fruit Company. In 1890, he invented the refrigerator car to transport fruits to the East Coast of the United States. He established the Continental Fruit Express and invested US$2,000,000 in refrigerator cars. In 1901, he sold his refrigerator cars to Armour and Company of Chicago and became a millionaire.

By the turn of the 20th century, manufactured ice became more common. The Pacific Fruit Express (PFE) - a joint venture between the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads, with a fleet of 6,600 refrigerator cars built by the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) - maintained seven natural harvesting facilities, and operated 18 artificial ice plants. Their largest plant (located in Roseville, California) produced of ice daily, and Roseville&#x27;s docks could accommodate up to 254 cars. At the industry&#x27;s peak, of ice was produced for refrigerator car use annually.

On the east coast of the United States, in 1920 the company Fruit Growers Express (FGE) was established and owned by a consortium of eastern railroads to serve the wholesale market for refrigerated produce delivered by railcar. In addition to operating and servicing refrigerated railcars, FGE became a major manufacturer of insulated boxcars and mechanical refrigerated cars.

===Ice===

The use of ice to refrigerate and preserve food dates back to prehistoric times. Through the ages, the seasonal harvesting of snow and ice was a regular practice of many cultures. China, Greece, and Rome stored ice and snow in caves, dugouts or ice houses lined with straw or other insulating materials. Rationing of the ice allowed the preservation of foods during hot periods, a practice that was successfully employed for centuries. For most of the 19th century, natural ice (harvested from ponds and lakes) was used to supply refrigerator cars. At high altitudes or northern latitudes, one foot tanks were often filled with water and allowed to freeze. Ice was typically cut into blocks during the winter and stored in insulated warehouses for later use, with sawdust and hay packed around the ice blocks to provide additional insulation. A late-19th century wood-bodied reefer required re-icing every to .
Top icing is the practice of placing a to layer of crushed ice on top of agricultural products that have high respiration rates, need high relative humidity, and benefit from having the cooling agent sit directly atop the load (or within individual boxes). Cars with pre-cooled fresh produce were top iced just before shipment. Top icing added considerable dead weight to the load. Top-icing a reefer required in excess of of ice. It had been postulated that as the ice melts, the resulting chilled water would trickle down through the load to continue the cooling process. It was found, however, that top-icing only benefited the uppermost layers of the cargo, and that the water from the melting ice often passed through spaces between the cartons and pallets with little or no cooling effect. It was ultimately determined that top-icing is useful only in preventing an increase in temperature, and was eventually discontinued.


The typical service cycle for an ice-cooled produce reefer (generally handled as a part of a block of cars):
# The cars were cleaned with hot water or steam.
# Depending on the cargo, the cars might have undergone four hours of &quot;pre-cooling&quot; prior to loading, which entailed blowing in cold air through one ice hatch and allowing the warmer air to be expelled through the other hatches. The practice, dating back almost to the inception of the refrigerator car, saved ice and resulted in fresher cargo.
# The cars&#x27; ice bunkers were filled, either manually from an icing dock, via mechanical loading equipment, or (in locations where demand for ice was sporadic) using specially designed field icing cars.
# The cars were delivered to the shipper for loading, and the ice was topped-off.
# Depending on the cargo and destination, the cars may have been fumigated.
# The train would depart for the eastern markets.
# The cars were reiced in transit approximately once a day.
# Upon reaching their destination, the cars were unloaded.
# If in demand, the cars would be returned to their point of origin empty. If not in demand, the cars would be cleaned and possibly used for a dry shipment.

Refrigerator cars required effective insulation to protect their contents from temperature extremes. &quot;Hairfelt&quot; derived from compressed cattle hair, sandwiched into the floor and walls of the car, was inexpensive, yet flawed  over its three- to four-year service life it would decay, rotting out the car&#x27;s wooden partitions and tainting the cargo with a foul odor. The higher cost of other materials such as &quot;Linofelt&quot; (woven from flax fibers) or cork prevented their widespread adoption. Synthetic materials such as fiberglass and polystyrene foam, both introduced after World War II, offered the most cost-effective and practical solution.

The United States Office of Defense Transportation implemented mandatory pooling of class RS produce refrigerator cars from 1941 through 1948. World War II experience found the cars spending 60 percent of their time traveling loaded, 30 percent traveling empty, and 10 percent idle; and indicated the average 14 loads each car carried per year included 5 requiring bunker icing, 1 requiring heating, and 8 using ventilation or top icing.
Following experience with assorted car specifications, the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association (UFF&amp;VA) listed what they considered the best features of ice refrigerator cars in 1948:
* Steel cars (vs wood) for better insulation protection and greater rigidity resulting in reduced leakage around doors
* A minimum of insulation thickness with all insulation protected from moisture
* Cushioned trucks and draft gear to minimize jarring and bruising of produce
* Standardized interior dimensions to allow improved loading methods with standardized containers
* Adjustable ice bunker bulkheads to allow greater floor space for shippers using top icing alone
* Vertically adjustable grates within the ice bunkers to allow half-stage icing to reduce icing charges where appropriate
* Forced air circulation within the car
* An additional lining to allow side wall flues circulating air around all cargo preventing contact with exterior car walls
* Perforated floor racks providing similar protection and air circulation under the cargo
* Provisions for pre-cooling the cars with a portable unit at the loading platforms.

===Mechanical refrigeration===
In the latter half of the 20th century, mechanical refrigeration began to replace ice-based systems. Soon after, mechanical refrigeration units replaced the armies of personnel required to re-ice the cars. The sliding plug door was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.&#x27;s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car. By the mid-1970s, the few remaining ice bunker cars were relegated to &quot;top-ice&quot; service, where crushed ice was applied atop the commodity.

===Cryogenic refrigeration===
The Topeka, Kansas shops of the Santa Fe Railway built five experimental refrigerator cars employing liquid nitrogen as the cooling agent in 1965. A mist induced by liquefied nitrogen was released throughout the car if the temperature rose above a pre-determined level. Each car carried of refrigerant and could maintain a temperature of minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (−30 °C). During the 1990s, a few railcar manufacturers experimented with the use of liquid carbon dioxide (CO) as a cooling agent. The move was in response to rising fuel costs, and was an attempt to eliminate the standard mechanical refrigeration systems that required periodic maintenance. The CO system can keep the cargo frozen solid as long as 14 to 16 days.

Several hundred &quot;cryogenic&quot; refrigerator cars were placed in service transporting frozen foodstuffs, though they failed to gain wide acceptance (due, in part, to the rising cost of liquid carbon dioxide).

===Experimentation===

====Aluminum and stainless steel====
Several experimental cars were built when wartime production restrictions were relaxed in 1946:

* Illinois Central Railroad number 51000 was built in the McComb, Mississippi shops with an aluminum superstructure to reduce weight with steel where required for strength and provided the standard dimensions, cushioned draft gear, easy-riding trucks, minimum of insulation, adjustable ice bunker bulkheads and half-stage icing racks with forced air circulation through side wall flues and floor racks recommended by UFF&amp;VA.
* Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch number 13000 was built of stainless steel by the Consolidated Steel Corporation of Wilmington, California with convertible ice bunkers, side ventilation ducts, and axle-driven circulation fans. It was thought that stainless steel would better resist the corrosive deterioration resulting from salting the ice. The one-of-a-kind unit entered service as #13000, but was subsequently redesignated as #1300, and later given #4150 in 1955. The car spent most of its life in express service. Cost was cited as the reason no additional units were ordered. The car was dismantled at Clovis, New Mexico in February 1964.
* Pacific Fruit Express rebuilt two steel-sided ventilator refrigerator cars in their Los Angeles shops with aluminum car bodies to test durability of lightweight alloys versus that of steel. It was hoped that weight savings (the units weighed almost less than a like-sized all-steel car) and better corrosion resistance would offset the higher initial cost. Alcoa provided the body for number 44739, and Reynolds Aluminum Company provided number 45698. The cars (outfitted with state-of-the-art fiberglass insulation and axle-driven fans for internal air circulation) traveled throughout the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific systems, where they were displayed to promote PFE&#x27;s post-World War II modernization. Though both units remained in service over 15 years (#45698 was destroyed in a wreck in May 1962, while #44739 was scrapped in 1966), no additional aluminum reefers were constructed.
* Fruit Growers Express number 38374 was equipped with an experimental aluminum body in the Indiana Harbor, Indiana shops.

====&quot;Depression Baby&quot;====
During the 1930s, the North American Car Company produced a one-of-a-kind, four-wheeled ice bunker reefer intended to serve the needs of specialized shippers who did not generate sufficient product to fill a full-sized refrigerator car. NADX #10000 was a -long, all-steel car that resembled the forty-and-eights used in Europe during World War I. The prototype weighed and was outfitted with a ice bunker at each end. The car was leased to Hormel and saw service between Chicago, Illinois and the southern United States. The concept failed to gain acceptance with eastern railroads and no additional units were built.

====Dry ice====
The Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch (SFRD) briefly experimented with dry ice as a cooling agent in 1931. The compound was readily available and seemed like an ideal replacement for frozen water. Dry ice melts at (versus for conventional ice) and was twice as effective thermodynamically. Overall weight was reduced as the need for brine and water was eliminated. While the higher cost of dry ice was certainly a drawback, logistical issues in loading long lines of cars efficiently prevented it from gaining acceptance over conventional ice. Worst of all, it was found that dry ice can adversely affect the color and flavor of certain foods if placed too closely to them.

====Hopper cars====
In 1969, the Northern Pacific Railroad ordered a number of modified covered hopper cars from American Car and Foundry for transporting perishable food in bulk. The -long cars were blanketed with a layer of insulation, equipped with roof hatches for loading, and had centerflow openings along the bottom for fast discharge. A mechanical refrigeration unit was installed at each end of the car, where sheet metal ducting forced cool air into the cargo compartments.

The units, rated at capacity (more than twice that of the largest conventional refrigerator car of the day) were economical to load and unload, as no secondary packaging was required. Apples, carrots, onions, and potatoes were transported in this manner with moderate success. Oranges, on the other hand, tended to burst under their own weight, even after wooden baffles were installed to better distribute the load. The Santa Fe Railway leased 100 of the hoppers from ACF, and in April 1972 purchased 100 new units, known as &quot;Conditionaire&quot; cars.

The cars&#x27; irregular, orange-colored outer surface (though darker than the standard AT&amp;SF yellow-orange used on reefers) tended to collect dirt easily, and proved difficult to clean. Santa Fe eventually relegated the cars to more typical, non-refrigerated applications.

===Preservation===
Examples of many styles of refrigerator and ice cars can be found at railroad museums around the world.

The Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California features a very complete roster of 20th century cars, including wood bodied ice cars, steel bodied ice cars, one of the earliest mechanical refrigerator cars, later mechanical refrigerator cars and a cryogenic reefer, as well as several &quot;insulated&quot; boxcars also used for food transport.

==Refrigerator cars in Japan==
The first refrigerated cars in Japan entered service in 1908, primarily for fish transport. They were of the ReSo 200 type, from 1909 followed by the ReSo 210 type and from 1912 followed by the ReSo 230 type; all reclassified into in 1928. Many of these cars were equipped with ice bunkers, however the bunkers were not generally used. Fish were packed in wooden or foam polystyrene boxes with crushed ice.

Fruit, vegetables and meat transportation in refrigerated rail cars was not common in Japan. For fruits and vegetables, ventilator cars were sufficient due to the relatively short distances involved, whereas since meat require low temperature storage, they were therefore typically transported by ship, since most major Japanese cities are located along the coast.

Refrigerator cars suffered heavy damage in World War II. After the war, the occupation forces confiscated many cars for their own use, using the ice bunkers as originally intended. Supplies were landed primarily at Yokohama, and reefer trains ran from the port to U.S. bases around Japan. Around this time, the surviving pre-war refrigerator cars were gradually retired and replaced with newer types.

In 1966, JNR developed the refrigerated cars that could travel at They were used in fish freight express trains. &quot;Tobiuo&quot; (Flying fish) train from Shimonoseki to Tokyo, and &quot;Ginrin&quot; (Silver scale) train from Hakata to Tokyo, were operated.

By the 1960s, refrigerator trucks had begun to displace railcars. Strikes in the 1970s resulted in the loss of reliability and punctuality, important to fish transportation. In 1986, the last refrigerated cars were replaced by reefer containers.

Most Japanese reefer cars were four-wheeled due to small traffic demands. There were very few bogie wagons in late years. The total number of Japanese reefers numbered approximately 8,100. At their peak, about 5,000 refrigerated cars operated in the late 1960s. Mechanical refrigerators were tested, but did not see widespread use.

There were no privately owned reefers in Japan. This is because fish transportation was protected by national policies and rates were kept low, and there was little profit in refrigerated car ownership.

==Refrigerated trains in the United Kingdom==
Due to the shorter distance to be travelled in the United Kingdom, the need for refrigeration was limited to specialised goods, which could in express-train format - mostly run overnight to avoid delays from passenger traffic - be transported in suitable timescales of less than a day from the area of production to processing, or onwards to the point of consumer consumption.

Hence whilst similar cattle, fish, fruit and farm-fresh produce shipping requirements existed, the need to refrigerate was often minimised by the use of non-stop express train service to the required destination. In example, the London Midland and Scottish Railway ran specialised express trains from meat producer hubs in Scotland and the North of England to the Smithfield Meat Market in London, with a dedicated goods station located below ground level directly into the market&#x27;s slaughtering house. The LMS and the LNER also ran express fish trains from Fleetwood and Grimsby to Broad Street to access Billingsgate Fish Market.

The big four railway companies standardised within their own networks their own ice-chilled wagons, which being built with more insulation again minimised the need for onboard mechanical refrigeration. The Great Western Railway designed and built their own Mica A (ventilated) and Mica B (Non-ventilated) vans for such express produce trains, with ice supplied by the original product producer from their own plant.

One specialised form of fresh produce train which existed in the UK was the milk train, which through use of specialised chilled glass-lined wagons remained in service until 1981.

Like many railways around the world, modern UK railways do ship specialised refrigerated containers on intermodal trains, with such trains now taking-over the roll again from long-distance trucking on hub-to-hub routes to reduce carbon foot print. DB Cargo UK runs Europe&#x27;s longest-distance single-operator handled train from Valencia, Spain to Barking in East London twice weekly, in partnership with Eddie Stobart Logistics and retailer Tesco&#x27;s, shipping fresh fruit and produce in refrigerated ISO containers.

==Specialized applications==

===Express service===
Standard refrigerated transport is often used for goods with less than 14 days of refrigerated &quot;shelf life&quot; — avocados, cut flowers, green leafy vegetables, lettuce, mangoes, meat products, mushrooms, peaches and nectarines, pineapples and papayas, sweet cherries, and tomatoes. &quot;Express&quot; reefers are typically employed in the transport of special perishables: commodities with a refrigerated shelf life of less than seven days, such as human blood, fish, green onions, milk, strawberries, and certain pharmaceuticals.

The earliest express-service refrigerator cars entered service around 1890, shortly after the first express train routes were established in North America. The cars did not come into general use until the early 20th century. Most units designed for express service are larger than their standard counterparts, and are typically constructed more along the lines of baggage cars than freight equipment. Cars must be equipped with speed-rated trucks and brakes, and — if they are to be run ahead of the passenger car, must also incorporate an air line for pneumatic braking, a communication signal air line, and a steam line for train heating. Express units were typically painted in passenger car colors, such as Pullman green.

The first purpose-built express reefer emerged from the Erie Railroad Susquehanna Shops on August 1, 1886. By 1927, some 2,218 express cars traveled America&#x27;s rails, and three years later that number rose to 3,264. In 1940, private rail lines began to build and operate their own reefers, the Railway Express Agency (REA) being by far the largest. In 1948, the REA roster (which would continue to expand into the 1950s) numbered approximately 1,800 cars, many of which were World War II &quot;troop sleepers&quot; modified for express refrigerated transport. By 1965, due to a decline in refrigerated traffic, many express reefers were leased to railroads for use as bulk mail carriers.

===Intermodal===
For many years, virtually all of the perishable traffic in the United States was carried by the railroads. While railroads were subject to government regulation regarding shipping rates, trucking companies could set their own rate for hauling agricultural products, giving them a competitive advantage. In March 1979, the ICC exempted rail transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables from all economic regulation. Once the &quot;Agricultural Exemption Clause&quot; was removed from the &quot;Interstate Commerce Act&quot;, railroads began aggressively pursuing trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) business (a form of intermodal freight transport) for refrigerated trailers. Taking this one step further, a number of carriers (including the PFE and SFRD) purchased their own refrigerated trailers to compete with interstate trucks.

===Tropicana &quot;Juice Train&quot;===

In 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped in bulk via insulated boxcars in one weekly round-trip from Bradenton, Florida, to Kearny, New Jersey. By the following year, the company was operating two 60-car unit trains a week, each carrying around of juice. On June 7, 1971, the &quot;Great White Juice Train&quot; (the first unit train in the food industry, consisting of 150 insulated boxcars fabricated in the Alexandria, Virginia, shops of Fruit Growers Express) commenced service over the route. An additional 100 cars were soon added, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant. Tropicana saved $40 million in fuel costs during the first ten years in operation.

===Railex and other unit trains===
In 2006 Railex LLC launched service in partnership with the Union Pacific Railroad and CSX between Wallula, Washington, and Rotterdam, New York, followed in 2008 by a Delano, California, to NY line, and Jacksonville, Florida service from the west coast in 2014. Railex runs unit trains of 55 large, &quot;plate F&quot; refrigerated cars.
Two additional refrigerated unit-train services were announced in 2013, the Green Express, from Tampa, Florida to Kingsbury, Indiana, operated by CSX and the Tampa Port Authority, and the TransCold Express operated by McKay Transcold, LLC and BNSF, connecting the California Central Valley with the midwest.

The Little Miami Railroad reached the village c. 1845. A post office called Oregon was established in 1846, and the name was changed to Oregonia in 1882. The post office has since been consolidated with the Lebanon post office.

Today, Oregonia is a stop on the Little Miami Bike Trail which follows the former train route along the Little Miami River. Bikers, hikers, and canoers often stop at the market or a restaurant along the trail which follows the river on the former train route. In October of each year, the &quot;Devils Staircase&quot; motorcycle hill climb is held on a hill just south of the main settlement.

<text>A link contract is an approach to data control in a distributed data sharing network. Link contracts are a key feature of the XDI specifications under development at OASIS.

In XDI, a link contract is a machine-readable XDI document that governs the sharing of other XDI data. Unlike a conventional Web link, which is essentially a one-dimensional &quot;string&quot; that &quot;pulls&quot; a linked document into a browser, a link contract is a graph of metadata (typically in JSON) that can actively control the flow of data from a publisher to a subscriber by either &quot;push&quot; or &quot;pull&quot;. The flow is controlled by the terms of the contract, which can be as flexible and extensible as real-world contracts, i.e., link contracts can govern:

* Identification: Who are the parties to the contract?
* Authority: Who controls the data being shared via the contract?
* Authentication: How will each party prove its identity to the other? 
* Authorization: Who has what access rights and privileges to the data?
* Scope: What data does it cover?
* Permission and Privacy: What uses can be made of the data and by whom? 
* Synchronization: How and when will the subscriber receive updates to the data? 
* Termination: What happens when the data sharing relationship is ended? 
* Recourse: How will any disputes over the contract be resolved?

Like real-world contracts, link contracts can also refer to other link contracts. Using this design, the vast majority of link contracts can be very simple, referring to a very small number of more complex link contracts that have been carefully designed to reflect the requirements of common data exchange scenarios (e.g., business cards, mailing lists, e-commerce transactions, website registrations, etc.)

Link contracts have been proposed as a key element of digital trust frameworks such as those published by the non-profit Open Identity Exchange.

<text>Hammel and Millgrove are extinct towns in western Warren County, Ohio, United States. They are located along the Little Miami River, about 2 miles (3 km) south of Fort Ancient and 1 mile (1½ km) north of Roachester at the Strout Road crossing of the river. Hammel lies on the eastern shore of the river, in southwestern Washington Township, and Millgrove lies on the western shore of the river, in northeastern Salem Township.

Hammel had its start in the 1840s when the railroad was extended to that point. The community was named after its founder. The GNIS considers Hammel to be a ghost town.

<doc id="1135807" wikidata="Q7017098" url="?curid=1135807" title="Newbridge Networks">
<text>Newbridge Networks Corporation was an Ottawa, Ontario, Canada company founded by Welsh-Canadian entrepreneur Sir Terry Matthews. It was founded in 1986 to create data and voice networking products after Matthews was forced out of his original company Mitel. According to Matthews, he saw that data networking would grow far faster than voice networking, and he had wanted to take Mitel in much the same direction, but the &#x27;risk-averse&#x27; British Telecom-dominated Mitel board refused and effectively ousted him. The name Newbridge Networks comes from Sir Terry Matthews&#x27; home town of Newbridge in south Wales.

Newbridge quickly became a major market player in this area using the voice switching and software engineering expertise that was prevalent in the Ottawa area.

The company initially had innovative channelbank products, which allowed telcos with existing wiring to offer a wide variety of new services. Newbridge also offered (for the time) the industry&#x27;s most innovative network management (46020 NMS) and ISDN TAP 3500, RS-232C 3600 Mainstreet and ACC &quot;river&quot; routers (Congo/Amazon/Tigris etc.), including distributed star-topology routing through both proprietary software over the unused facilities&#x27; data links in optical hardware and telco switches.

Starting in 1992 the company became increasingly focused upon and well known for its family of ATM products such as the MainStreet 36150 and MainStreet Xpress 36170 (later renamed Alcatel 7470).

Newbridge later absorbed some routing technology that had been abandoned by Tandem Computers, with the purchase of Ungermann-Bass and entered the pure data networking market with a traditional routing and switching product. This was in addition to its internally developed ViViD product line, which was a network-wide distributed routing product (ridge or routing bridge—bridges with a centralized routing server).

Newbridge had 30% ownership of affiliate West End Systems Corp., which was headquartered in Kanata, Ontario, with R&amp;D facilities in Arnprior, Ontario.

Newbridge was purchased and absorbed by Alcatel in late February 2000 for over $7 billion in stock. With this transaction, Matthews became the single largest shareholder in Alcatel.

<doc id="1135808" wikidata="Q3094742" url="?curid=1135808" title="Galileo Galilei (opera)">
<text>Galileo Galilei is an opera based on excerpts from the life of Galileo Galilei, which premiered in 2002 at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre, as well as subsequent presentations at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s New Wave Music Festival and London&#x27;s Barbican Theatre. The music is by Philip Glass, with libretto and original direction by Mary Zimmerman and Arnold Weinstein. The piece is presented in one act, consisting of ten scenes without break.

&quot;Galileo Galilei&quot; is Glass&#x27; s 18th opera. The libretto draws from letters of Galileo and his family, and various other documents, to retrospectively journey through Galileo&#x27;s life. Opening with him as an old, blind man after the trial and Inquisition for his heresy, it explores his religiosity as well as his break with the church. It expands into the greater, oscillating relationship of science to both religion and art. It reaches its end with Galileo — as a young boy — watching an opera composed by his father, Vincenzo Galilei, who was a member of the Florentine Camerata, an association of artists who are credited with creating the art form that came to be known as opera. His father&#x27;s opera was about the motions of the celestial bodies.

The opera has been revived with new productions in 2012 by Madison Opera and Portland Opera. The Portland Opera production was recorded by Orange Mountain Music. Opera Theatre of Saint Louis is staging it in June 2024.

==Production notes==
All genius meets with extreme resistance before it is accepted as truth. In the case of Galileo, it was the mere hypothesis that the Earth revolved around the Sun. The notion was considered heretical and blasphemous by scholars and clergy alike. Much was done to destroy Galileo&#x27;s reputation. And since they could not do so through scientific proof, they did so through slander and threats of torture. It was not until recently that the Catholic Church finally admitted that they were wrong in persecuting Galileo. It took hundreds of years for them to admit the mistake. Galileo died believing that all of the advancements he had made in science were for naught. His books were banned, and his name was disgraced. All of this, for suggesting a theory that turned out to be true.

In addition to depicting Galileo&#x27;s trials before the Inquisition, the opera also allows us a glance into Galileo&#x27;s more personal side. Namely, in showing us his relationship to his daughter Maria Celeste, who was a nun. Maria Celeste shared her father&#x27;s love of learning and science, but also understood that he was a man of great faith. She recognized that science was the very subject that served to deepen his faith, and she encouraged him on this path. The two met rarely. They were separated not only by distance, but by Galileo&#x27;s often ailing health. Sadly, they were ultimately separated by her death at the age of 33, a source of incredible sadness for Galileo. However, their connection in this opera serves to give his story a more personal rendering. The story itself is told backwards through time. It begins with an aged Galileo, blinded from having looked at the Sun too often and ends with him as a child. This is related to the function of a telescope, which works by reversing images with lenses. Much of the staging in this production is representative of Galileo&#x27;s theories and follows the patterns of the discoveries, planets, and constellations that his inventions made known to the world.

==Synopsis==
;Scene 1
&quot;Opening Song&quot;

In the final days of his life, the now blind Galileo Galilei remembers the things in his life that he can no longer see.

;Scene 2
&quot;Recantation&quot;

The officials of the Catholic Church rebuke the scientist for not relenting on his theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. The Pope hands down his sentence, and then reminds Galileo of a time when they walked in the garden as friends.

;Scene 3
&quot;Pears&quot;

Maria Celeste, the daughter of Galileo, sends her intense devotion love and support through letters that are accompanied by elements of her garden at the convent.

;Scene 4
&quot;Trial&quot;

Galileo is summoned before two Cardinals of the Catholic Church to answer questions regarding his book &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World&quot;.

;Scene 5
&quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World&quot;

As Galileo pens his book, the fictitious characters come alive to discuss the theories presented. &quot;Here, the Older Galileo becomes the Younger Galileo.&quot;

;Scene 6
&quot;Incline Plane&quot;

The theories and experiments are put to the test in Galileo&#x27;s laboratory.

;Scene 7
&quot;A Walk in the Garden&quot;

Galileo and his great friend Cardinal Barberini discuss Galileo&#x27;s newest book in the Garden. After the Cardinal&#x27;s feeble attempt at poetry, Galileo expresses his fear of his enemies. Barberini warns Galileo not to continue with his theories regarding the planets.

;Scene 8
&quot;Lamps&quot;

While at mass with his daughter, Galileo observes the swinging of a lamp suspended from the ceiling moving in pendulum fashion and explains his theory to Maria Celeste.

;Scene 9
&quot;Presentation of the Telescope&quot;

Galileo presents his invention to the Duchess and her Ladies in Waiting. The Duchess and Galileo reminisce about a time in their youth when they watched an opera together composed by Galileo&#x27;s father, Vincenzo.

;Scene 10
&quot;Opera within the Opera&quot;

The Duchess and Galileo, now children, are in the audience as his father&#x27;s opera is performed. The magical story of the planetary figures becomes the vehicle through which Galileo is reunited with his deceased daughter.

<text>Joseph N. Tascona (born October 9, 1951) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the ridings of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford and Simcoe Centre from 1995 to 2007. He also served as an alderman for Barrie City Council from 1991 to 1995. In 2010 he ran for mayor of Barrie but lost to Jeff Lehman.

==Background==
Tascona is the son of Edna (Smith) and Joe Tascona. He has an M.B.A. from McMaster University and an LL.B. from Queen&#x27;s University, and worked as a prominent labour and employment lawyer before entering public life. He also worked for the Ford Motor Company in matters relating to production and labour relations. He has also written several articles for the &quot;Industrial Relations Centre&quot; at Queen&#x27;s University on labour and employment law. Tascona also has a sister, Judy who is the mother of former Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown.

==Politics==
Tascona began his political career at the municipal level, serving on Barrie City Council from 1991 to 1995 as an alderman in the City of Barrie&#x27;s second ward. Tascona was responsible for overseeing the construction of the Barrie Public Library, and the Molson Hockey Centre and helping secure Barrie&#x27;s waterfront land for public use.

In the provincial election of 1995, he was elected in the riding of Simcoe Centre, defeating Liberal Bruce Owen and incumbent New Democrat Paul Wessenger by a plurality of over 17,000 votes. The Conservatives won the election and Tascona served as a backbench supporter of the Mike Harris government for the next four years.

In the 1999 provincial election, Tascona was re-elected in the redistributed riding of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, defeating Liberal Maura Bolger by 18,345 votes. During his second term, Tascona was appointed as Parliamentary assistant to several ministers including the Minister of Education, the Solicitor General and the Minister of Consumer and Business Services.

Although the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 2003 provincial election, Tascona was re-elected in his riding with a margin of victory of 9,531 votes. He was subsequently appointed opposition critic for the Attorney General and Government Service. Tascona was also elected as Second Deputy Chair of the Committee of the Whole House. In April 2006, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill &quot;Restore the Deed Act&quot;, calling for the protection of homeowners from title and mortgage fraud and such measures were implemented by the provincial government.

In the 2007 provincial election, Tascona was defeated by Aileen Carroll in the new riding of Barrie.

In 2010, Tascona ran for mayor of Barrie. He was the first to register his name. He lost to Barrie city councilor Jeff Lehman on October 25.

<text>The Sarlacc (plural Sarlacci) is a fictional creature in George Lucas&#x27;s sci-fi action saga &quot;Star Wars&quot;. It first appeared in the film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) as a multi-tentacled alien beast whose immense, gaping maw is lined with several rows of sharp teeth, inhabiting the Great Pit of Carkoon, a hollow in the sand of the desert planet Tatooine. After the bounty hunter Boba Fett escapes from its maw in &quot;Chapter 1: Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; of &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2022) and eventually returns to retrieve his armor, the Sarlacc is killed by his partner Fennec Shand in &quot;Chapter 4: The Gathering Storm&quot;.

In the original &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the Sarlacc is depicted as a barbed gaping mouth in the desert sand with tentacles. The 1997 Special Edition of the film added computer-generated tentacles and a beak to the mouth, which has remained its canonical depiction since. Besides &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the creature and others like it are featured in &quot;Star Wars&quot; literature.

Like other aspects of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the Sarlacc became a part of popular culture. The creature was incorporated into the merchandising campaign that accompanied the release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. It is the subject of analysis and humor in works of literature unassociated with &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

== Depiction ==

The Sarlacc first appeared in the 1983 film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, wherein Jabba the Hutt attempts to drop Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca into the creature&#x27;s mouth; but Luke frees himself and the others with the aid of Lando Calrissian and R2-D2, while Princess Leia strangles Jabba.

According to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Databank, the Sarlacci inhabit remote, inhospitable locations in the galaxy, but defy taxonomic classification, insofar as most texts claim that the Sarlacc is an arthropod (as in &quot;The Essential Guide to Alien Species&quot; and &quot;The Wildlife of Star Wars&quot;), while its anchored root system and spore-based method of reproduction suggest a plant origin. A Sarlacc reproduces by releasing spores through outer space, which arrive on a planet or asteroid, and there excavate a pit to capture prey.

Steve Sansweet&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Encyclopedia&quot; describes the Sarlacc as an &quot;omnivorous, multi-tentacled creature with needle-sharp teeth and a large beak&quot;. The Sarlacc rests at the base of a giant pit where the entirety of its body is buried except for the gaping mouth, which may reach three meters (10 feet) in diameter. The Sarlacc uses its four legs to anchor itself underground. Astrophysicist and science fiction author Jeanne Cavelos compares the Sarlacc&#x27;s hunting method to that of the antlion. The Sarlacc&#x27;s mouth also has similarities with that of the lamprey.

Because most Sarlacci inhabit isolated environments and rely on prey to stumble into their pit, they rarely feed; the digestive system dissolves prey into nutrients over a period of several thousand years. If no living prey is available, a Sarlacc relies on its root system to absorb nutrients. One Sarlacc located on an airless moon feeds on cometary material rich in oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.

The Sarlacc&#x27;s stomach is lined with vessels that attach themselves to a swallowed victim and maws for quick digestion or breaking apart of large prey. The maws close when exposed to bright lights. The stomach also contains neurotoxins, which induce hallucinations in prey which &quot;suggest that the Sarlacc somehow absorbs the intelligence of all its victims, who live on in disembodied torment&quot;. A Sarlacc can communicate with its victims through this stolen consciousness: In one &quot;Star Wars&quot; short story, an unnamed Jedi explains that &quot;Sarlacci do interesting things with messenger RNA: over the course of millennia, they can attain a sort of group consciousness, built out of the remains of people they&#x27;ve digested. I talked to such a Sarlacc, once a few decades ago&quot;.

In the anthology &quot;Tales from Jabba&#x27;s Palace&quot; (1995), edited by Kevin J. Anderson, Dan&#x27;l Danehy Oakes&#x27;s story &quot;Shaara and the Sarlacc: The Skiff Guard&#x27;s Tale&quot; is told by one of Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s soldiers, who tells Boba Fett that his sister Shaara and her Imperial stormtrooper captors were thrown into the pit, whereupon the Sarlacc swallowed the stormtroopers, but expelled Shaara, for reasons unknown. In the short story &quot;A Barve Like That: The Tale of Boba Fett&quot;, by Daniel Keys Moran under the pseudonym of J. D. Montgomery, Boba Fett struggles to free himself from the belly of the Sarlacc. As Fett is digested, the creature converses with him mentally in the voice of an alien named Susejo, eaten by the Sarlacc four thousand years earlier. Having caused his jet pack to explode, Fett uses a concussion grenade to blast himself free. Years later, Fett is recognized by the Sarlacc upon approach.

In the non-canonical Dark Horse comic book &quot;Fortune, Fate, and the Natural History of the Sarlacc&quot;, written by Mark Schultz and illustrated by Kellie Strom, the Sarlacc seen in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; is the offspring of an older Sarlacc on Tatooine. Shortly after the execution of an unknown alien named Grubbat Fhilch, the Sarlacc releases a spore that attaches to an Imperial stormtrooper&#x27;s dewback. The stormtroopers hire a group of Jawa scavengers to clean the dewbacks, from which one Jawa acquires the spore, and places it in a jar of water. The young Sarlacc escapes from the jar only to be swallowed by a spider-like creature, which it consumes from within, and later forms the Great Pit of Carkoon.

Sarlacci have made minor appearances in &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games such as &quot;Super Star Wars&quot; (1992), &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot; (1996), &quot;Star Wars: Demolition&quot; (2000), &quot;Star Wars: Bounty Hunter&quot; (2002), &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike&quot; (2003), and &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot; (2004). The MMORPG &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; (2003) shows one of the smaller Sarlacci in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy on the remote planet Dathomir. It has also made an appearance in &quot;Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot;, &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot; 2022 &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot;, MMORPG &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; (2008), where a Sarlacc much larger than the one on Tatooine is first an ally of a Jedi Knight, and later used as a base for the Empire (even building structures inside the creature itself). A duel is fought beside the Sarlacc in this game between Starkiller and Shaak Ti, until Ti falls backwards into the Sarlacc&#x27;s open mouth. The &quot;Rise Against the Empire&quot; playset of &quot;Disney Infinity 3.0&quot; (2015) has the famous Sarlacc and Pit of Carkoon outside Tatooine, around which stand several Jawa, and the player can pick up a Jawa to throw in.

In &quot;Super Star Wars&quot;, the &quot;Sarlacc Pit Monster&quot; acts as a boss early into the game. It is depicted as a large, worm-like creature with tentacles, and shoots rocks at Luke.

The first episode of &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; shows a scene of the title character inside the Sarlacc&#x27;s innards, as he breathes from a dead stormtrooper&#x27;s respirator and escapes from the pit by blasting through with his flamethrower. In episode four, The Gathering Storm, the Sarlacc is killed by a seismic charge dropped by &quot;Slave I&quot;.

== Concept and creation ==

The design of the Sarlacc creature—originally called the &quot;Sloth Pit&quot;—seen in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; evolved during the concept, creation, and filming processes. Early concept sketches portrayed a creature with several moving tentacles and a pronounced beak; but &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas did not have the technology or financial resources to realize this concept in the 1983 film.

Special effects artists Stuart Freeborn, Phil Tippett, and the crew of Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) constructed a pit in the desert sands of Yuma, Arizona, that contained a gaping mouth with jagged teeth and tentacles. At the time, the pit (with Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s sail barge) constituted one of the largest motion picture sets ever constructed. A hydraulic system was designed to animate the creature, but the blowing sand clogged the mechanism. The film crew instead used poles and wires to move the creature&#x27;s tentacles. Lucas was not satisfied with the effect, complaining, &quot;There was nothing alive about the whole thing.&quot;

Working on the giant set was an arduous task, according to the crew members involved. Tippett told &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine, &quot;We were working the creature at the bottom of a gorge, so we got no breeze. Sand constantly fell down upon us&quot;. In addition to operating the Sarlacc, many technicians were standing in as skiff guards in full wardrobe. Tippett remarks, &quot;[We] were covered with [sand and] glue from the costumes. I almost cracked on that one. I think I cried, it was so terrible.&quot; Actress Carrie Fisher recalled that many of the crew and stuntmen who fell into the creature during filming suffered broken legs and sprained ankles. ILM crew members received some satisfaction when they dismantled the set at the conclusion of filming and sold it to Mexico as scrap. The one condition of the sale was that the materials were not to be resold as souvenirs.
The Sarlacc design underwent a series of changes when Lucas released the Special Edition of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in 1997. Employing the new technology of computer-generated imagery (CGI), ILM amended the creature&#x27;s appearance with the addition of CGI tentacles and a beak inside the Sarlacc&#x27;s mouth. According to Lucas, it &quot;just looks much more realistic and more threatening ... it helps the scene considerably.&quot; Subsequent depictions of the Sarlacc in &quot;Star Wars&quot; fiction are based on this revised design.

Some of the special effects from the 1983 film were retained in the Special Edition. The tentacle that captures the skiff guard Kithaba and pulls him into the Sarlacc mouth is from the original film, as well as the tentacle that attaches to Lando Calrissian&#x27;s leg.

== In popular culture ==
Aside from &quot;Star Wars&quot; fiction and merchandising, popular fiction author Stefan Demetriou uses the Sarlacc as a descriptive term for slowness, a reference to the creature&#x27;s extended digestive process.

The Sarlacc became part of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; merchandising campaign that accompanied the theatrical release of the film. Parker Brothers produced a board game in 1983 called &quot;Battle at Sarlacc&#x27;s Pit&quot; that was sold in the United States and Canada. Players collect points for battling their way through Gamorrean guards, Boba Fett, and a Nikto on Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s sail barge, pushing them overboard into a cardboard Sarlacc. The game, which sold for only a few years, is a collector&#x27;s item.

Hollywood journalist and humor writer Peter Biskind muses that George Lucas went to great extremes to remove aspects of sex and sexuality from the plot of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Biskind, however, asserts that Lucas created a &quot;nightmarishly explicit image of threatening female sexuality&quot; in the form of the Sarlacc: &quot;The Jabba episode culminates in an explicit &quot;vagina dentata&quot; fantasy, as Luke and his pals have to walk a phallic gangplank into the pullulating maw—festooned with long, curved teeth—of the giant Sarlacc in its &#x27;nesting place&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine reviewer Tim Bissell complained, &quot;Lucas sent his trilogy’s most arresting character Boba Fett to a &quot;death&quot; so inglorious—falling headlong into the &quot;vagina dentata&quot; of Tatooine&#x27;s Sarlacc—that its only payoff was a burp gag.&quot;

In the TV series &quot;Peep Show&quot;, Mark Corrigan references &quot;the pit of Sarlacc&quot; when finishing off the remains of a packet of crisps.

In 2018, a cave that was discovered in British Columbia, Canada was unofficially named Sarlacc&#x27;s Pit.

In the TV series &quot;Ghost Wars&quot; (2017–2018), Billy McGrath (performed by Kim Coates) refers to the inability of people to leave town due to the events triggered by the earthquake. In conversation with town&#x27;s major Val McGrath-Dufresne (performed by Luvia Petersen), Val points out that he had been able to get into town, so &quot;If there&#x27;s a way in, there&#x27;s gotta be a way out&quot;, to which Billy replies &quot;Tell that to a Sarlacc.&quot;

The front cover of Randall Munroe&#x27;s book &quot;What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions&quot; features a T. rex being lowered into a Sarlacc pit.

&quot;Lego&quot; released a set titled &quot;Desert Skiff &amp; Sarlacc Pit&quot; featuring Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Lando, Chewbacca, and Boba Fett.

<text>Sir John Phillip William Dankworth, CBE (20 September 1927 – 6 February 2010), also known as Johnny Dankworth, was an English jazz composer, saxophonist, clarinettist and writer of film scores. With his wife, jazz singer Dame Cleo Laine, he was a music educator and also her music director.

==Biography==
=== Early years===
Dankworth was born in Walthamstow, then in the County Borough of West Ham, in 1927. He grew up, within a family of musicians, in Hollywood Way, Highams Park, a suburb of Chingford, and attended Selwyn Boys&#x27; (Junior) School in Highams Park and later Sir George Monoux Grammar School in Walthamstow. He had violin and piano lessons before settling eventually on the clarinet at the age of 16, after hearing a record of the Benny Goodman Quartet. Soon afterwards, inspired by Charlie Parker, he learned to play the alto saxophone.

He began his career on the British jazz scene after studying at London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music (where his jazz interests were frowned upon) and then national service in the Royal Air Force, during which he played alto sax and clarinet for RAF Music Services. In July 1947, he worked on the Queen Mary in Bobby Kevin&#x27;s band, and in London with Les Ayling, later in 1947, and with Tito Burns until May 1948. He attended the Paris Jazz Festival in 1949 and played with Charlie Parker. Parker&#x27;s comments about Dankworth led to the engagement of the young British jazz musician for a short tour of Sweden, with the soprano-saxophonist Sidney Bechet. In 1949, Dankworth was voted Musician of the Year.

===1950s===
In 1950, Dankworth formed a small group, the Dankworth Seven, as a vehicle for his writing activities as well as a showcase for several young jazz players, including himself (alto sax), Jimmy Deuchar (trumpet), Eddie Harvey (trombone), Don Rendell (tenor sax), Bill Le Sage (piano), Eric Dawson (bass) and Tony Kinsey (drums). Vocalist and percussionist Frank Holder also sang and recorded with this ensemble. After three successful years, the group was wound up, although it re-formed for several reunions over the years.

Dankworth formed his big band in 1953. Johnny Dankworth and His Orchestra had a top 10 novelty hit song in 1956 in the UK, &quot;Experiments with Mice&quot; based on &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;, which parodied a number of jazz bands and artists, including Billy May, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Stan Kenton, Sauter-Finegan, and others. By now, Cleo Laine&#x27;s singing was a regular feature of Dankworth&#x27;s recordings and public appearances. 

The band was earning plaudits from the critics and was invited to the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival, the first British group to receive an invite. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic said of this appearance &quot;Mr. Dankworth&#x27;s group ... showed the underlying merit that made big bands successful many years ago – the swinging drive, the harmonic colour and the support in depth for soloists that is possible when a disciplined, imaginatively directed band has worked together for a long time. This English group has a flowing, unforced, rhythmic drive that has virtually disappeared from American bands&quot;. More succinctly, Gerard Lascelles of &quot;The Tatler&quot;, noted that &#x27;The Dankworth orchestra blew magnificently&#x27;. The band performed at the Birdland jazz club in New York City, and shortly afterwards shared the stage with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for a number of concerts. Dankworth&#x27;s band also performed at a jazz event at New York&#x27;s Lewisohn stadium where Louis Armstrong joined them for a set.

In 1959, Dankworth became chair of the Stars Campaign for Inter-Racial Friendship, set up to combat the fascist White Defence League. Around this time, he had also refused to travel to South Africa to perform to all-white audiences during Apartheid.

===1960s===
In 1961, Dankworth&#x27;s recording of Galt MacDermot&#x27;s &quot;African Waltz&quot; reached the UK Singles Chart, peaked at No. 9, and remained in the chart for 21 weeks. American altoist Cannonball Adderley sought and received Dankworth&#x27;s permission to record the arrangement and had a minor hit in the US as a result. The piece was also covered by many other groups. In 1967, drummer Ronnie Stephenson&#x27;s part on &quot;African Waltz&quot; was adapted by the Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s Mitch Mitchell, to form the basis of the drum part on &quot;Manic Depression&quot;.

Dankworth&#x27;s friendship with trumpeter Clark Terry led to Terry&#x27;s being a featured soloist on Dankworth&#x27;s 1964 album &quot;The Zodiac Variations&quot;, together with Bob Brookmeyer, Zoot Sims, Phil Woods, Lucky Thompson and other guests. Other Dankworth recordings during this period featured many other respected jazz names. Some were full-time members of the Dankworth band at one time or another, like Tony Coe, Mike Gibbs, Peter King, Dudley Moore, George Tyndale, Daryl Runswick, John Taylor and Kenny Wheeler, while others such as Dave Holland, John McLaughlin, Tubby Hayes and Dick Morrissey were occasional participants.

Dankworth began a second career as a composer of film and television scores (often credited as &quot;Johnny Dankworth&quot;). Among his best-known credits are the original themes for two British TV programmes, &quot;The Avengers&quot; (used from 1961 to 1964) and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; (included on the 1972 LP &quot;Lifeline&quot;). He also wrote the scores for the films &quot;Darling&quot; (1965) and &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; and &quot;Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (both 1966). He appeared in the film &quot;All Night Long&quot; (1962) with Dave Brubeck and Charles Mingus – playing himself – and played on the theme to the satirical BBC show &quot;The Frost Report&quot; in 1966.

Dankworth was commissioned to write a piece for the 1967 Farnham Festival; and produced &quot;Tom Sawyer&#x27;s Saturday&quot;; written for full orchestra and narrator: &quot;a sort of &#x27;Peter and the Wolf&#x27; which could be played by most reasonably competent youth orchestras&quot;.

During this active period of recording, the Dankworth band nevertheless found time for frequent live appearances and radio shows, including tours in Britain and Europe with Nat King Cole, Sarah Vaughan and Gerry Mulligan, and concerts and radio performances with Lionel Hampton and Ella Fitzgerald.

===1970s and 1980s===
Dankworth&#x27;s friendship with Duke Ellington continued until the latter&#x27;s death in 1974. He recorded an album of symphonic arrangements of many Ellington tunes featuring another Ellingtonian trumpet soloist Barry Lee Hall. Dankworth also retained his Ellington links by performing with the Ellington Orchestra under the direction of Duke&#x27;s son, Mercer Ellington. Dankworth recorded various symphonic albums with Dizzy Gillespie and the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and others. Other jazz musicians with whom Dankworth performed include George Shearing, Toots Thielemans, Benny Goodman, Herbie Hancock, Hank Jones, Slam Stewart and Oscar Peterson.

He always had an enthusiasm for jazz education, for many years running the Allmusic summer schools at the Stables in Wavendon near Milton Keynes, a theatre that Laine and he created in January 1970 in their back garden. From 1984 to 1986, Dankworth was professor of music at Gresham College, London, giving free public lectures.

In 1982, Dankworth was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

===Later work===
He appeared with Craig David on &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot; on BBC Two. He set up his own record label, Qnotes, in 2003, to reissue some of his old recordings as well as new ones. They include a number with Julian Lloyd Webber, Dudley Moore and members of his family.

Dankworth and Laine&#x27;s two children are both jazz musicians: Alec Dankworth is a bassist who was also a member of his father&#x27;s band, and Jacqui Dankworth is a singer.

Dankworth was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2006 New Year&#x27;s Honours List. He and Dame Cleo Laine were one of the few married couples where both partners held titles in their own right.

He remained an active composer into later life, and he wrote a jazz violin concerto for soloist Christian Garrick to play. This work had its world premiere at the Nottingham Royal Concert Hall on 3 March 2008, in partnership with the Nottingham Youth Orchestra.

In October 2009, at the end of a US tour with his wife, Dankworth was taken ill. The couple cancelled a number of UK concert dates for the following month. Dankworth did return to the concert stage for just one solo at the London Jazz Festival at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in December 2009. He played his sax from a wheelchair. He also played in &quot;John &amp; Cleo&#x27;s Christmas Show&quot; from 17 to 20 December 2009 at The Stables in Wavendon.

===Personal life and death===
After her divorce from George Langridge became final, in 1957, a year later in 1958 Dankworth married jazz singer Cleo Laine in secret at Hampstead Registry Office. The only witnesses at their wedding were Dankworth&#x27;s friend, pianist Ken Moule, and arranger David Lindup. The couple had two children, bassist Alec Dankworth and singer Jacqui Dankworth.

On 6 February 2010, Dankworth died at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital in London, from complications of kidney failure and liver failure; he was 82. His death occurred on the afternoon before a show celebrating the 40th anniversary of the foundation of The Stables. 

His funeral took place on 1 March 2010 at Milton Keynes Crematorium, followed by a memorial service held at The Stables the same day.

<doc id="1135831" wikidata="Q257881" url="?curid=1135831" title="Ritt Bjerregaard">
<text>Ritt Bjerregaard (full name Jytte Ritt Bjerregaard; 19 May 1941 – 21 January 2023) was a Danish politician who was a member of the Danish Social Democrats, and was Lord Mayor of Copenhagen from 1 January 2006 to 2010.

Bjerregaard was Education Minister from 27 September to 19 December and again from 13 February 1975 to 22 December 1978. 1973 and from 1975 to 1978 in the Cabinets of Anker Jørgensen I, II and III, and Social Minister from 1979 to 1981 in Anker Jørgensen&#x27;s fourth cabinet. She was European Commissioner for the Environment from 1994 to 1999 and Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries in the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen IV from 2000 to 2001.

==Political career==
Bjerregaard was a member of the Danish parliament (Folketinget) from 21 September 1971 to 22 January 1995 and from 20 November 2001 until 8 February 2005. She was a minister of various cabinets under Anker Jørgensen, and Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. In 1971 she was elected to the Odense City Council where she served just one term and resigned in 1973. In 1971 and 1975-1978 she held the position as minister of education, where she changed the Primary School Act in 1975 with the support from the majority of the other parties. On 5 November 1975, Bjerregaard hired an external chancellor for Roskilde University. Venstre and Conservative People&#x27;s Party wanted to abolish the university, but thanks to the independent politician, former Conservative People&#x27;s Party member Hans Jørgen Lembourn, the university was saved. In 1976 she introduced restricted admission at universities while meanwhile securing the protection of minorities. In 1977 Bjerregaard got the law about – EFG (Vocational basic training) approved. With former head of department Erik Ib Schmidt she launched the ambitious, complete education plan U 90 from 1978.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Ritt changed her stance on the EU. After being an opponent for many years, she became chair of the Danish European Movement ().

Bjerregaard was the European Commissioner for Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil Protection in the Santer Commission from 1995 to 1999, representing Denmark. She has attended at least one Bilderberg Group meeting from 8–11 June 1995. She has also attended Trilateral Commission meetings in 1992, 1998 and 2002.

Bjerregaard was involved with various organisations. She was vice-president of both OSCE&#x27;s Parliamentary Assembly and Socialist International Women (SIW) from 1992 to 1994.
Four days after Bjerregaard was appointed Minister of Food in February 2000, the first case of mad cow disease, a dangerous brain disease, occurred. With the ministry Bjerregaard acted fast and consistently. The butchering methods were changed and a ban on risk products was installed. These consistent measures were at first not received well, neither by the farmers nor the food industry. Especially the initiative to withdraw certain foods from the retailers was criticised. But later on the industry realized that the measures protected the consumers and created great confidence in Danish food products in the export market.
In 2001 Bjerregaard introduced the Smiley system. It caused an occasion for big discussions but today the system is generally recognized.

Bjerregaard won the election for Lord Mayor on the Copenhagen City Council for the Social Democrats on 16 November 2005, a position she acquired through a high number of personal votes.
During her time as Lord Mayor of Copenhagen, Ritt invited mayors of cities around the world to a summit on the climate in the cities. The summit was a prelude to COP15, which took place in Copenhagen. At the summit, Ritt Bjerregaard wished to discuss what big cities could do to lower -emissions. The meeting was successful and mayors made a promise to take action.

==Controversy==

During her time as minister of education in 1978, she stayed in a luxury suite at the Ritz Hotel in Paris during a Unesco conference, and this forced her to step down when it became known. Later on The National Audit Office declared that she had not spent more money than other ministers. This later fueled a debate at the Danish Parliament. She returned to politics again soon hereafter in 1979 as social minister.

In the early 1990s it was revealed she had used her connections within the Social Democratic organisations to get a large flat in Copenhagen, although she rarely used it, living on Funen. She was then forced to step down as parliamentary group leader of the Social Democrats. After a year, the case was dropped by the municipality.

===&#x27;5,000 Cheap Flats&#x27; promise===
Her main campaign promise for the city council elections of 2005 was to erect 5,000 cheap dwellings for 5,000 kroner (US$948) rent a month within five years, should she be elected Lord Mayor. This would allow an average-earning couple, such as policemen and nurses, to gain access to the expensive housing market in Copenhagen. Economists and other experts criticised the plan for being impossible to implement. As of the summer of 2007, twelve such flats had been built.

On 11 July 2007, Bjerregaard claimed she never promised Copenhageners would get 5,000 cheap dwellings within five years, but merely that she would &quot;work&quot; for that aim. She claimed many unexpected and legal obstacles had come about, and that the government obstructed the issue. She also expected, however, that the 5,000 flats would be ready within seven to ten years.

===Leadership===
Since the November 2005 city elections, three prominent Social Democrats have left their fraction: Winnie Berndtson, Finn Rudaizky and Winnie Larsen-Jensen. In June 2007, long-time city politician Larsen-Jensen claimed:

&quot;As a city council member I have experienced four Lord Mayors. Ritt is the most autocratic, absolutist, centralist and undemocratic of all.&quot;
In return, Bjerregaard claimed that Larsen-Jensen &quot;suffered personal problems&quot; which could not be commented on in public.
The opposition, as well of the left-wing factions, have accused Ritt of dictatorial conduct and obstructing their insight into political cases.

Bjerregaard is regarded as one of the four most influential Social Democrats from the so-called golden generation, the others being Mogens Lykketoft, Svend Auken and Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.

===Office refurbishment===
In August 2007, Bjerregaard ordered custom designed furniture for her Lord Mayor office at a cost of 850,000 kroner (US$161,000).

==Personal life==
Bjerregaard grew up in Vesterbro in Copenhagen as the daughter of joiner Gudmund Bjerregaard and bookkeeper Rita Bjerregaard. She was the oldest of three siblings. She was hospitalized several times because of narrow and unhealthy conditions, until the family acquired an allotment. She finished her exam from Christianshavn Gymnasium in 1958 and became a modern side student from Statens Kursus til Studentereksamen in 1966.

After getting her teachers&#x27; certificate in 1964 from Emdrupborg, she worked as a folkeskole (primary school) teacher until 1970. In the same period she was a consultant for publishing house Gyldendal. In 1971, she became assistant professor at Odense College of Education. She has been married to historian Søren Mørch since 1966.

In her spare time, she was a gardener on her organically-managed manor, mostly growing apples.

Bjerregaard wrote several books during her life, latest being the first volume of her memoirs titled &#x27;Ritt&#x27; (2015).

==Death==
Bjerregaard died of cancer at her home in Copenhagen on 21 January 2023, at the age of 81.

<text>Gandalf Technologies, Inc., or simply Gandalf, was a Canadian data communications company based in Ottawa. It was best known for modems and terminal adapters that allowed computer terminals to connect to host computers through a single interface. Gandalf also pioneered a radio-based mobile data terminal that was popular for many years in taxi dispatch systems. The rapid rise of TCP/IP relegated many of Gandalf&#x27;s products to niche status, and the company went bankrupt in 1997; its assets were acquired by Mitel.

==History==
Gandalf was founded by Desmond Cunningham and Colin Patterson in 1971, and started business from the lobby of the Skyline Hotel, which is now the Crowne Plaza Hotel, on Albert Street in Ottawa.

The company&#x27;s first products were industrial-looking half-bridges for remote terminals which were supported by large terminal multiplexers on the &quot;computer end&quot;. Gandalf referred to these systems as a &quot;PACX&quot;, in analogy to the telephony PABX which provided similar services in the voice field. These systems allowed the user to &quot;dial up&quot; the Gandalf box and then instruct it what computer they wanted to connect to. In this fashion, large computer networks could be built in a single location using shared resources, as opposed to having to dedicate terminals to different machines. These systems were particularly popular in large companies and universities.

Gandalf supplanted these systems with &quot;true&quot; modems, both for host-to-host use and for remote workers. Unlike most modems, Gandalf&#x27;s devices were custom systems intended to connect only to another Gandalf modem, and were designed to extract the maximum performance possible. Gandalf sold a number of different designs intended to be used with different line lengths and qualities, from 4-wire modems running at 9600 bit/s over &quot;short&quot; distances (bumped to 19,200 bit/s in later models), to 2400 bit/s models for 2-wire runs over longer distances. On the host-end, modem blocks could be attached to the same PACX multiplexers, making local and remote access largely identical.

With the introduction of low-cost high-speed modems in the early 1990s, Gandalf increasingly became irrelevant. Even highest-speed solutions were soon being outperformed by standardized systems like v.32bis. Low-cost terminal adapters based on RADIUS (and similar) technologies connecting to Ethernet further eroded its core businesses, offering features similar to PACX switches. Gandalf&#x27;s solutions were decidedly &quot;low tech&quot;; users selected what computer they wanted to connect to by selecting a two-digit number on the front of the modem, often requiring a &quot;phone book&quot; if more than one host computer was being used. In comparison, the more modern terminal adapters generally included a command line interface that allowed the user to select a host from a directory that appeared on their terminal. Introductions of Ethernet concentrators and ISDN-based versions of earlier host adapters did little to fix the problem, never becoming very popular in comparison to the standardized solutions from other vendors.

Gandalf Technologies filed for bankruptcy in 1997. Mitel purchased all of the product business of Gandalf, including intellectual properties, the goodwill of the business including the exclusive right to use the name worldwide for $14.9 million. Mitel used the data technology and personnel to help move its PBX division into the VoIP market. Mitel tried to keep some Gandalf data products in the market for a short time, but poor sales led to them being abandoned.

<text>Queen Lurline is a fictional character in the Oz books by L. Frank Baum and other authors.

The name &quot;Lurline&quot; is a variant of Loreley, the Rhine nymph; the name has been used for ships, and has other associations.

==Lurline in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s books==
===Descriptions in the Oz books===
In the Oz mythos, Lurline is first mentioned in &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot;. She is the ethereal Queen of the Fairies and their creator. She is credited with enchanting the Land of Oz centuries ago so that it became a fairy country. Prior to this, Oz was just an ordinary country shut off from the rest of the world by four impassable deserts. After enchanting the country, Lurline left Princess Ozma to rule the country together with King Pastoria.

Lurline is therefore a fundamental ingredient in the backstory or foundation myth of Oz; and as such she recurs in various subsequent Oz books — as in Edward Einhorn&#x27;s &quot;Paradox in Oz&quot; — and is at least mentioned in others — from Baum&#x27;s&quot; Glinda of Oz&quot; to Dave Hardenbrook&#x27;s &quot;The Unknown Witches of Oz&quot;.

===Possible references in other series===
In Baum&#x27;s book, &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot;, the Queen of the Fairies is unnamed, and the Queen of the Wood Nymphs is named Zurline. Some debate exists among fans of the Oz books as to whether the unnamed Fairy Queen and Lurline are the same person. &quot;Queen Zixi of Ix&quot; depicts another Fairy Queen named Lulea, who is based in the Forest of Burzee, just as The Fairy Queen and Queen Zurline of the Wood Nymphs are.

==Lurline in Gregory Maguire&#x27;s books==
Lurline also appears in &quot;&quot;, Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 revisionist novel set in Oz; she is sometimes called &quot;Lurlina&quot;. Maguire&#x27;s version of Lurline is depicted as the central figure in a pagan religion in Oz. Although faith in the fairy queen Lurline is described as out of fashion, Oz celebrates a winter holiday dedicated to her, known as Lurlinemas. Lurline&#x27;s followers are sometimes persecuted by believers in one of Oz&#x27;s other major religion, Unionism, which worships &quot;The Unnamed God.&quot;

<doc id="1135860" wikidata="Q467364" url="?curid=1135860" title="Leona Helmsley">
<text>Leona Roberts Helmsley (born Lena Mindy Rosenthal; July 4, 1920 – August 20, 2007) was an American businesswoman. After allegations of non-payment were made by contractors hired to improve Helmsley&#x27;s Connecticut home, she was investigated and convicted of federal income tax evasion and other crimes in 1989. Although having initially received a sentence of 4 years, she was required to serve only 19 months in prison and two months under house arrest. During the trial, a former housekeeper testified that she had heard Helmsley say: &quot;We don&#x27;t pay taxes; only the little people pay taxes.&quot; This quote was identified with her for the rest of her life. Helmsley&#x27;s flamboyant personality and reputation for tyrannical behavior earned her the nickname Queen of Mean.

==Early life==
Helmsley was born Lena Mindy Rosenthal in Marbletown, New York, to Polish-Jewish immigrants, Ida Popkin, a homemaker, and Morris Rosenthal, a hatmaker. Her family moved to Brooklyn while she was still a girl, and moved six more times before settling in Manhattan. After dropping out of Abraham Lincoln High School to seek her fortune, she changed her name several times over a short period—from Lee Roberts, Mindy Roberts, and Leni Roberts—before finally going by Leona Mindy Roberts and having her surname legally changed to Roberts.

Roberts&#x27; first husband was attorney Leo Panzirer, whom she divorced in 1952. Their only son was Jay (1940–1982), who had four children with his wife, Mimi. Jay died of heart failure at age 42. Leona was twice married to and divorced from her second husband, garment industry executive Joseph Lubin. After a brief period at a sewing factory, she joined a New York real estate firm, where she eventually became vice-president. Roberts was a chain smoker, consuming several packs a day. She would later claim that she appeared in billboard ads for Chesterfield cigarettes, but her claim remains unsubstantiated.

==Career as a hotelier==
In 1968, while Roberts was working as a condominium broker, she met and began her involvement with the then-married real estate entrepreneur Harry Helmsley. Two years later, she joined one of Harry&#x27;s brokerage firms—Brown Harris Stevens—as a senior vice-president. At that time, she was already a millionaire in her own right. Harry divorced his wife of 33 years and married Roberts on April 8, 1972. The marriage may well have saved her career, as several of her tenants had sued her the year before for forcing them to buy condominiums. They won, and she was forced not only to compensate the tenants but to give them three-year leases. Her real estate license was also suspended, so she focused on running Harry&#x27;s growing hotel empire.

Supposedly under her influence, Harry began a program of conversion of apartment buildings into condos. He later concentrated on the hotel industry, building the Helmsley Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue. Together, the Helmsleys built a New York real estate empire that included 230 Park Avenue, the Empire State Building, and the Tudor City apartment complex on the East Side, as well as Helmsley-Spear Inc., their management and leasing business. The couple also developed properties that included the Helmsley Palace Hotel, the New York Helmsley Hotel, the Park Lane Hotel, and hotels in Florida and other states. By the beginning of 1989, twenty-three hotels in the chain were directly controlled by Leona Helmsley.

Helmsley was featured in an advertising campaign portraying her as a demanding &quot;queen&quot; who wanted nothing but the best for her guests. The slightest mistake was usually grounds for firing, and Helmsley was known to shout insults and obscenities at targeted employees just before they were fired. On March 31, 1982, Helmsley&#x27;s only child, Jay Panzirer, died of a heart attack resulting from arrhythmia. Her son&#x27;s widow, who lived in a property that Helmsley owned, received an eviction notice shortly after his funeral. Helmsley successfully sued her son&#x27;s estate for money and property that she claimed he had borrowed, and she was ultimately awarded $146,092.

==Tax-evasion conviction==
Despite the Helmsleys&#x27; net worth totalling over $1 billion, they were known for disputing payments to contractors and vendors. In 1983, the Helmsleys bought Dunnellen Hall, a 21-room mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, to use as a weekend retreat. The property cost $11 million but the Helmsleys wanted to make it even more luxurious. The work included a $1 million dance floor, a silver clock and a mahogany card table. The remodeling bills came to $8 million, which the Helmsleys were loath to pay. A group of contractors sued the Helmsleys for non-payment and the Helmsleys eventually paid off most of the debt owed to the contractors. In 1985, during court proceedings in relation to the lawsuit, the contractors revealed that most of their work was being illegally billed to the Helmsleys&#x27; hotels as business expenses. The contractors sent a stack of the falsified invoices to the &quot;New York Post&quot; to prove that the Helmsleys were trying to avoid tax liabilities. The resulting &quot;Post&quot; story led to a federal criminal investigation. Jeremiah McCarthy, the Helmsleys&#x27; executive engineer, also alleged that Leona repeatedly demanded that he sign invoices to bill personal expenses to Helmsley-Spear and, when McCarthy declined to do so, exploded with tyrannical outbursts, shouting, &quot;You&#x27;re not my fucking partner! You&#x27;ll sign what I tell you to sign.&quot; In 1988, then-U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani indicted the Helmsleys and two of their associates on several tax-related charges, as well as extortion.

The trial was delayed until the summer of 1989 due to numerous motions by the Helmsleys&#x27; attorneys, most of them related to Harry&#x27;s health. He had begun to appear feeble shortly after the beginning of his relationship with Leona years before and had recently suffered a stroke on top of a pre-existing heart condition. Ultimately, he was ruled mentally and physically unfit to stand trial and Leona would face the charges alone. At trial, a former Helmsley-Spear executive, Paul Ruffino, said that he refused to sign phony invoices billing the company for work done on the Connecticut mansion. Ruffino, originally employed to assist Harry through the Hospitality Management Services arm, said that Leona fired him on several occasions for refusing to sign the bills, only for Harry to usually tell him to ignore her and come back to work.

Another one of the key witnesses was a former housekeeper at the Helmsley home, Elizabeth Baum, who recounted Leona telling her, &quot;We don&#x27;t pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.&quot; Leona denied saying this. By then, however, the trial was already highlighting her abusive and micromanaging behavior towards family members, employees, contractors and even senior executives. Former employees testified at trial &quot;about how they feared her, with one recalling how she casually fired him while she was being fitted for a dress&quot;. Most legal observers felt that Helmsley&#x27;s hostile personality, arrogance, and &quot;naked greed&quot; alienated the jurors. On August 30, Helmsley was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, three counts of tax evasion, three counts of filing false personal tax returns, sixteen counts of assisting in the filing of false corporate and partnership tax returns, and ten counts of mail fraud. She was, however, acquitted of extortion—a charge that could have sent her to prison for the rest of her life. Helmsley was instead originally sentenced to four years in prison, which was eventually reduced to 18 months after resentencing. Nonetheless, when it was clear that she was going to prison, Helmsley collapsed outside the courthouse. She was later diagnosed with a heart irregularity and hypertension. Helmsley&#x27;s new lawyer, retained to appeal the judgment, was Alan Dershowitz. Following the appeal, which resulted in a reduced sentence, she was ordered to report to prison on tax day, April 15, 1992. She was released from custody on January 26, 1994, after serving twenty-one months.

==After prison==
Helmsley&#x27;s later years were apparently spent in isolation, especially after Harry died in 1997. He left her his entire fortune, including the Helmsley hotels, the Helmsley Palace and the Empire State Building, estimated to be worth well in excess of $5 billion. Her few friends included Patrick Ward and Kathy and Rick Hilton. A 2001 &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; article depicted her as estranged from her grandchildren and with few friends, living alone in a lavish apartment with her dog. Helmsley was forced to give up control of her hotel empire, since most of her hotels had bars and New York does not allow convicted felons to hold alcohol licenses. She spent her final years at her penthouse atop the Park Lane Hotel. In 2002, Helmsley was sued by Charles Bell, a former employee who alleged that he was discharged solely for being gay. A jury agreed and ordered Helmsley to pay Bell $11,200,000 in damages. A judge subsequently reduced this amount to $554,000.

Although Helmsley had a reputation as the &quot;Queen of Mean&quot;, some considered her generous in her charitable contributions after her prison term. After the 9/11 attacks, Helmsley donated $5 million to help the families of New York City firefighters and police. Other contributions included $25 million to New York–Presbyterian Hospital for medical research in 2006 through a charitable trust fund, the donations eventually grew to $65 million to establish the Center for Advanced Digestive Care at the hospital in 2009.

==Death==
Helmsley died of congestive heart failure at the age of 87, on August 20, 2007, at Dunnellen Hall. Cardiovascular disease ran in her family, having killed her father, son and one of her sisters. After a week at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, she was entombed next to Harry Helmsley in a mausoleum constructed for $1.4 million and set on ¾-acres in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Westchester County, New York. Among the few distinctive features of the mausoleum are three wall-embedded stained-glass windows, in the style of Louis Comfort Tiffany, showing the skyline of Manhattan. Leona Helmsley was known for not liking dirt, and left $3 million for the 1,300-square-foot family mausoleum to be &quot;washed or steam-cleaned at least once a year&quot;.

Helmsley left the bulk of her estate—estimated at more than $4 billion—to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. In addition to providing directly for her own dog in her will, she left separate instructions that the trust, now valued at $5 billion, be used to benefit dogs. The courts have ruled that the trust is not legally bound to wishes separate from the trust documents. The will left her Maltese dog, Trouble, a $12 million trust fund. This sum was subsequently reduced to $2 million as excessive to fulfill its purpose. Her choice was branded 3rd in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;101 Dumbest Moments in Business&quot; of 2007.

Trouble lived in Florida with Carl Lekic, the general manager of the Helmsley Sandcastle Hotel, with several death threats having been received. Lekic, Trouble&#x27;s caretaker, stated that $2 million would pay for the dog&#x27;s maintenance for more than 10 years—the annual $100,000 for full-time security, $8,000 for grooming and $1,200 for food. Lekic was paid a $60,000 annual guardianship fee. Trouble died at age twelve in December 2010, at which time the remainder of the funds reverted to the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. Although Helmsley&#x27;s wishes were to have the dog interred with her in the mausoleum, New York state law prohibits interment of pets in human cemeteries and the dog was subsequently cremated.

Helmsley had four grandchildren. Two of them each received $5 million in trust and $5 million in cash, under the condition that they visit their father&#x27;s grave site once each calendar year. Their signing a registration book would prove that they had visited the grave. Her other two grandchildren, Craig and Meegan Panzirer, received nothing. In a 2008 judgment, Manhattan Surrogate Court Judge Renee Roth ruled that Helmsley was mentally unfit when she executed her will. Roth reduced the $12 million trust fund for the pet Trouble to $2 million. Of the $10 million originally bequeathed to Trouble, $4 million was awarded to the charitable trust, and $6 million was awarded to Craig and Meegan Panzirer, who had been disinherited in the will. The ruling requires the Panzirers to keep silent about their dispute with their grandmother and deliver to the court any documents they have about her. She left $15 million for her brother Alvin Rosenthal. Helmsley also left $100,000 to her chauffeur, Nicholas Celea.

==Reputation==
Helmsley acquired the moniker &quot;Queen of Mean&quot;, reportedly inspired after an advertising campaign promoting her as the &quot;Queen of the Palace&quot; of the Helmsley Palace Hotel. Helmsley became known by this nickname in the mainstream press. Helmsley was known for &quot;tyrannizing her employees&quot;. Alan Dershowitz, while having breakfast with her at one of the Helmsley hotels, received a cup of tea with a tiny bit of water spilled on the saucer. Helmsley grabbed the cup from the waiter and smashed it on the floor, then told him to beg for his job. In another account of Helmsley&#x27;s behavior, she had a barbecue pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, claiming shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t he keep his pants on? Then he wouldn&#x27;t need the money.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The 1990 TV film &quot;Leona Helmsley: The Queen of Mean&quot; starred Suzanne Pleshette as Helmsley. Pleshette was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. In 1989, a biography entitled &quot;The Queen of Mean: The Unauthorized Biography of Leona Helmsley&quot; was published by Bantam Books.

<text>Associazioni Calcio Riunite Messina S.r.l. is a football club based in Messina, Sicily, Italy, that competes in the Serie C, the third tier of the Italian football league system.

== History ==

=== Football in Messina ===
The origins of the team go back to 1900, when Messina F.C. was founded in the city. The club has spent most of its existence in the lower Italian football leagues. They last competed in Serie B in 2007–08, which followed three consecutive seasons in Serie A. In July 2008, Messina were excluded from professional football due to financial issues, being later registered into amateur Serie D.

The farthest Messina has reached in the Coppa Italia is the last 16. This was achieved in the 2000s decade. In the past, they have also reached the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia Serie C.

Messina have appeared in the Italy&#x27;s top league, Serie A, for a total of five seasons. The club&#x27;s first spell in the league was in the 1960s; the second began in the 2000s decade. The highest ever position they have finished is 7th, which happened during the 2004–05 season.

==== From Messina F.C. to Giostra Messina (1900 to 1939) ====
The history of Messina Football Club began when Alfredo Marangolo returned to Sicily in August 1900 from studying in London, England. In Great Britain the game of football was fast gathering popularity with The Football League in its early stages.

Messina Football Club were officially founded on 1 December 1900 by Marangolo with the help of Anglican reverend &quot;Caulifield&quot;.

At the college where Marangolo visited he had also made the acquaintance of Ignazio Majo Pagano who formed Anglo Palermitan (Palermo) on his return, only a month before Messina. The first Sicilian derby was held between Messina and Palermo on 18 April 1901; 1,000 fans turned out to Via Notarbartolo for the match. The game ended 3–2 to the Palermitan side.

A strong bond and a healthy rivalry had built up between the two Sicilian clubs and a competition named the &quot;Whitaker Challenge Cup&quot; was arranged to be played between them. The first was held in 1905; Messina won another game (3–2) and captured their first trophy. Messina repeated the feat the following year at San Ranieri, capturing the trophy in a 2–1 victory.

The earthquake of 1908, which killed 60,000 people in Messina, later affected the club in a large manner; deaths included Charles Bousfield Huleatt, players Frank John Carter, Walter Oates and financial backer George H. Peirce. Football resumed in Messina the following year, thanks largely to Arthur Barret Lascelles who used his own money to ensure football activity in the city would continue. By 1910, the funds of Barret had dried up, and the club was folded, Società Ginnastica Garibaldi Messina (&quot;Gymnastic Society Garibaldi Messina&quot;) briefly took its place, until it too was dissolved due to the First World War.

After World War I, a club under the name US Messinese was founded and entered the following year&#x27;s Coppa Federale Siciliana, an all Sicilian championship contested in Messina, Catania and Palermo. Messina finished as runners-up.

The club participated in the Italian Football Championship of 1921–22, organised by the C.C.I., finishing third in the Sicilian group section; this was the first championship in which clubs from the island were entered. The following season the FIGC and CCI were unified. This coincided with mergers in Messina, as another side, Umberto I Messina, was incorporated into US Messinese, and, therefore, the club changed its name to US Messinese Umberto I in October 1922. The following month this new side was fused again, this time with Messina Sporting Club; creating the Messina Football Club. Only two years later, in December 1924, FC Messina was melted, and the players became part of the reformed US Messinese.

Finally, Messinese qualified for the semi-finals of the International League, after beating Palermo, 3–0, in the Sicilian championship of 1924–25. Here, Messinese played against Alba Roma, Cavese and Liberty Bari, but failed to win a single match, scoring only two goals in six games. Messina would be promoted to Serie B for the 1932–33 campaign under the presidency of Francesco Lombardo and Koenig&#x27;s coaching and remained in the league for six seasons. The spell in Serie B was also notable for the local rivalry between them and Calcio Catania.

===== From 1940 to 1947 =====
Down in Serie C, AC Messina were withdrawn and folded during 1940–41. The following season, in 1941–42, a club named US Peloro 1906 changed its name and became US Mario Passamonte (named after a fallen hero of the war in Africa). The idea was to enter the club into Serie C in place of Messina. However this was unsuccessful, until the following season.

It would not be long before all activity was halted in Italian football for World War II. After several mergers in 1945, including one between US Passamonte and AP Messina, the club AS Messina subsequently emerged as a post-war representative of Messina. This was not a clean cut merger. Some players and officials formed the rival club Giostra Messina. Both Giostra and AS Messina reached the finals of the Southern League but eventually finished fourth and fifth respectively.

==== A.C. Riunite Messina ====
In 1947, the two teams &quot;AS Messina&quot; and &quot;Giostra Messina&quot; were united as one merged club Associazioni Calcio Riunite Messina, abbreviated as AC Riunite Messina.

The 1950s for Messina began in glorious fashion, they were crowned champions of Serie C under the management of Yugoslav manager Mihalj Balačić. Messina did not falter in Serie B. During their first season in the league they avoided relegation. Giuseppe Melazzo and the Comitato Reggenza owned the club during this new period of relative success. During the following season, Messina finished in third place.

Throughout the rest of the 1950s, Messina remained in the division as a whole finishing in a respectable position. Goffredo Muglia took over as president in 1958, to begin a brand new era for the club. For the first time in their history, Messina were crowned champions of Serie B during the 1962–63 season. The race for the championship was a very close one and went down to the last day of the season, with Messina finishing above Bari and Lazio.

For their first ever season in Serie A, the football squad for Messina included; Morelli, Brambilla, Stucchi, Pagani, Dotti, Peruvian Benitez, Ghelfi, Fascetti, Morbello, Canuti and Clerici. Messina&#x27;s first game in Serie A took place on 15 September 1963. It ended in a 3–1 defeat against Sampdoria at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. As a whole, the first part of the season was not a success. They won only two games, but they managed to turn it around in the second half of the season with 7 wins, beating Juventus (1–0), Fiorentina (1–0) and Sampdoria (4–3). The surge of wins in the latter part of the season helped them stay up, finishing 14th.

The next season for the club in Serie A would not be so fortunate. They were relegated in 17th place. Some notable high points of the season included a 1–0 victory over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. A team from Rome would also be the opposition for Messina&#x27;s other most impressive result of the season. They stunned Lazio, beating them, 4–0, on the last day of the season.

The Sicilian side were not able to bounce straight back up into Serie A, and, in fact, after their third season back down in Serie B were relegated. After several seasons finishing in and around the top 10 positions of Serie C, Messina were relegated down to Serie D in the 1972–73 season. The club managed to bounce straight back, winning the Serie D championship and achieving promotion back into C. After a few decent seasons in the upper parts of the table, relegation struck Messina again. In the 1979 season Serie C2 was formed and Messina were placed into it.

By 1983, Messina were champions of Serie C2 and had a future star amongst their ranks in Salvatore Schillaci. The club, now back on the right track, came close to promotion to Serie B in 1985 with a third-place finish just behind Palermo, and won Serie C1 and earned themselves promotion back to Serie B the following season.

Time in Serie B during the 1980s, was a pleasant one for the Sicilian side. They notched seventh and eighth-place finishes. In 1989, Schillaci was sold to Turin giants Juventus, and, just three seasons after Schillaci&#x27;s departure, Messina lost their position in Serie B and were relegated down to C1 and then spiraled into further trouble. The club finished 12th in Serie C1 in the 1992–93 season, but, due to financial difficulties, the FIGC cancelled all professional football activity for Messina.

In 1993, it was included to Sicilian Promozione, and in 1994, it was admitted in Sicilian Eccellenza. In this league the club has played until 1998, when following the relegation in Sicilian Promozione, it was dissolved.

==== A.S. Messina ====
The decision was thought to be unjust by the club and fans, with Messina been thrown into a footballing abyss never known before. In the summer of 1993, A.S. Messina was founded with the president Pietro La Malfa, beginning in the amateurs national championship (C.N.D.) with the objective to bring back the &quot;giallorossi&quot; to professional football.

They played in the Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti for four seasons, finishing high up for the first three of them, but in the 1996–97 season, they were ranked last and relegated to the Sicilian Eccellenza league.

In the 1998–99 season, they were relegated to Sicilian Promozione and were dissolved.

==== From U.S. Peloro to F.C. Messina Peloro ====
In the summer of 1994, after the merger of &quot;Villafranca&quot; and &quot;Tremestieri&quot;, U.S. Peloro was founded. It played two seasons in Eccellenza Sicily, and in 1996, it was promoted to Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti (Serie D). Then, in the 1996 season, the club played in the same league as the town&#x27;s other team, &quot;A.S. Messina&quot;, where it was ranked 6th.

In July 1997, the club changed its name to Football Club Messina Peloro. In a few short seasons, the club ramped up the Italian league system, from &quot;Campionato Nazionale Dilettanti&quot; in the 1997–98 season, Messina were promoted into Serie C2 as champions. Promoted to Serie C1 in 2000, they immediately managed to fight hard for a promotion spot back to Serie B, winning promotion to Calcio Catania after play-offs. In less than a decade, under the presidency of Aliotta, Messina had climbed back up from the abyss and were back in the upper part of the Italian league system.

After two seasons in Serie B, local entrepreneur Pietro Franza took over, and in 2003–04, Sicily returned into Serie A under coach Bortolo Mutti. The club had not appeared in the top Italian league since 1965, a total of forty years.

After being tipped as underdogs in Serie A for the 2004–05 season, Messina surprised doubters by producing several good results including defeating both of the Milanese clubs, beating AC Milan first at San Siro 2–1, and then later in the season also with Internazionale, this time at home, for the first time in their history; the winning goal was struck by Rafael in the third minute of injury time.

Messina managed to stay clear of relegation throughout the whole season, and eventually finished in seventh place in the table, just a single place away from securing a UEFA Cup place. Also during this period, for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, Messina players were called up in the Italy national football team: first was Alessandro Parisi in 2004, then Carmine Coppola in 2005 who was called up twice by the &quot;azzurri&quot;.

Despite this impressive form, Messina were still in danger of being relegated from Serie A at the end of the season, due to a possibility of not having enough finances available to compete in the league. Eventually, though, they successfully managed to stay in the Serie A league. In the 2005–06 season, Messina were unable to repeat their previous impressive season, leading to the sacking of Mutti, who was replaced by Giampiero Ventura. Despite all, they looked to be mathematically relegated from the top division after Day 36. losing the derby against Reggina, 3–0. However, due to the Serie A scandal of 2006, Messina avoided relegation to Serie B despite finishing 18th.

Messina started the 2006–07 season with Bruno Giordano as head coach; however, he was replaced on 30 January 2007, by Alberto Cavasin because of poor results. On 2 April, following a 2–0 away defeat to Cagliari, another team involved in the battle to avoid relegation, Cavasin was sacked, and Giordano was recalled to fill the coaching position. Giordano&#x27;s record was even worse in his second time at Messina, with four defeats in four matches. With Messina second-last placed in the table five matchdays prior to the end of the season, Giordano was sacked again on 23 April, and replaced by Bruno Bolchi. Messina were relegated at the end of the season.

After a quiet Serie B season in 2007–08, in July 2008 Messina chairman Pietro Franza announced he did not find any investor ready to take over the club and that he was consequently giving up the club&#x27;s Serie B membership, declaring that he would look forward to enter the club into an amateur league. On 1 August, it was confirmed that Messina was admitted to Serie D. In November 2008, the Court of Messina declared the club to be bankrupt and appointed a trustee to start a search for potential investors.

==== A.C. Rinascita Messina ====

In March 2009, Rome-based entrepreneur Alfredo Di Lullo acquired Football Club Messina Peloro in a blind auction held by the Court of Messina in April 2009. The club was renamed A.C. Rinascita Messina (&quot;rinascita&quot; means &quot;revived&quot;). On 4 January 2011, the club was transferred to the group Martorano which on 14 August 2011, sold it to Raffaele &quot;Lello&quot; Manfredi.

In June 2012, the club was acquired by a consortium led by prominent football manager Pietro Lo Monaco, former managing director at Serie A club Catania and one of the masterminds behind the club&#x27;s rise into top flight in the 2000s. Messina finished 4th in Group I and qualified to the promotion playoffs in the 2011–12 season. It eliminated Battipagliese by a score of 3–1 in the first round but was eliminated by Cosenza by a score of 3–0 in the second round. Messina finally became champions of Group I of Serie D and were promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, the fourth level of the Italian league. After winning the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione/B title, the club was then admitted to play in the unified 2014–15 Lega Pro season.

==== A.C. Riunite Messina ====
Since the summer of 2014, the new name of the club is Associazioni Calcio Riunite Messina. In the 2014–15 season, the club was relegated to Serie D, but it was readmitted to Lega Pro for involvement in sporting fraud. Since the summer of 2015, the new owner and president is Natale Stracuzzi. The club failed to submit its surety by the 5 July 2017 deadline and was expelled by Lega Pro. A successor club, A.C.R. Messina S.s.d. a r.l. was admitted to the 2017–18 Serie D.

Under the ownership of local car dealing businessman Pietro Sciotto, Messina were promoted back to Serie C in 2021 as league champions, and have played in the Italian third tier ever since.

== Rivalries ==
Messina&#x27;s biggest rivals are Reggina, located on the mainland, due to their close proximity and matches are known as &quot;Derby dello Stretto&quot; (&quot;Derby of the Strait&quot;) as Messina and Reggio Calabria are separated by the Strait of Messina. 

Catania and Palermo, the other two biggest clubs in Sicily, compete the Sicilian derbies.

<doc id="1135870" wikidata="Q1049423" url="?curid=1135870" title="Castle Clinton">
<text>Castle Clinton (also known as Fort Clinton and Castle Garden) is a restored circular sandstone fort within Battery Park at the southern end of Manhattan in New York City, United States. Built from 1808 to 1811, it was the first American immigration station, predating Ellis Island. More than 7.5 million people arrived in the United States at Fort Clinton between 1855 and 1890. Over its active life, it has also functioned as a beer garden, exhibition hall, theater, and public aquarium. The structure is a New York City designated landmark and a U.S. national monument, and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Fort Clinton was originally known as the West Battery or the Southwest Battery, occupying an artificial island off the shore of Lower Manhattan. Designed by John McComb Jr., with Jonathan Williams as consulting engineer, the fort was garrisoned in 1812 but was never used for warfare. In 1824, the New York City government converted Fort Clinton into a 6,000-seat entertainment venue known as Castle Garden, which operated until 1855. Castle Garden then served as an immigrant processing depot for 35 years. When the processing facilities were moved to Ellis Island in 1892, Castle Garden was converted into the first home of the New York Aquarium, which opened in 1896 and continued operating until 1941. The fort was expanded and renovated several times during this period.

In the 1940s, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses proposed demolishing Fort Clinton as part of the construction of the nearby Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. This led to a prolonged debate over the fort&#x27;s preservation, as well as the creation of the Castle Clinton National Monument in 1946. The National Park Service took over the fort in 1950. After several unsuccessful attempts to restore the fort, Castle Clinton reopened in 1975 following an extensive renovation. Since 1986, it has served as a visitor center and a departure point for ferries to the Statue of Liberty National Monument.

==Original use==
Castle Clinton stands slightly west of where Fort Amsterdam was built in 1626, when New York City was known by the Dutch name New Amsterdam. Fort Amsterdam was demolished by 1790 after the American Revolutionary War. Proposals for a new fort were made after two separate war scares involving Britain and France in the 1790s, but neither plan was ultimately carried out. By 1805, there were growing tensions between Britain and the U.S., marking the run-up to the War of 1812. Late that year, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams of the United States Army Engineers began planning a series of fortifications in New York Harbor. Williams was part of a group of three commissioners who, in 1807, submitted a report that recommended the construction of such fortifications.

Fort Clinton, originally known as West Battery and sometimes as Southwest Battery, was built on an artificial island, created just off shore when the fort was built. Construction began in 1808, and the fort was completed in 1811, although modifications continued through the 1820s. Designed by John McComb Jr. with Jonathan Williams as consulting engineer, West Battery was roughly circular with a radius of approximately . About one-eighth of the circle had a straight wall instead of a curved wall. The walls were made of red sandstone quarried in New Jersey. The fort had 28 thirty-two-pounder cannons. A wooden bridge led from the fort to the rest of Manhattan. West Battery was intended to complement the three-tiered Castle Williams, the East Battery, on Governors Island.

The fort was completed in late 1811, and it was garrisoned in 1812. However, the fort was never used for warfare, and British and American forces signed a peace treaty in February 1815. By then, West Battery was renamed Fort Clinton in honor of New York City Mayor DeWitt Clinton (who eventually became Governor of New York). The castle proper was converted to administrative headquarters for the Army. Simultaneously, at the end of the war, there was a public movement to build a park in the Battery area. A 1816 proposal to construct two small office buildings at Fort Clinton was canceled due to public opposition, and the castle lay dormant for three years. The Common Council of New York proposed in May 1820 that the United States government transfer ownership of the castle to the city government, but the United States Congress declined to pass legislation to that effect.

By 1820, Fort Clinton was being used as a paymaster&#x27;s quarters and storage area. The United States Army stopped using the fort in 1821, and it was ceded to the city by an act of Congress in March 1822. By then, the bridge leading to Fort Clinton was frequently used by fishermen who were catching fish from the bridge, which was connected to the shore at the foot of Broadway.

==Entertainment venue==

The fort was leased to the New York City government as an entertainment venue in June 1824; the city originally paid $1,400 a year for five years. The city government subleased the fort to Francis Fitch, Arthur Roorbach, and J. Rathbone. Fort Clinton became Castle Garden, which served as a beer garden, exhibition hall, and theater. The venue contained 50 boxes, each with a table and eight seats. Atop Castle Garden was a circular promenade with a canopy above it. Castle Garden was surrounded by a gravel promenade and shrubbery atop a seawall. The &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; wrote that the fort &quot;afterward became associated with scenes of peace and popular amusement&quot;. One critic described Castle Garden in 1828 as &quot;a favored place of public resort&quot;.

The fort reopened as Castle Garden on July 3, 1824. One of the fort&#x27;s first events was in September 1824, when 6,000 people attended an event honoring General Lafayette. Over the years, the fort hosted other political figures such as U.S. presidents Andrew Jackson, John Tyler, and James K. Polk, as well as Hungarian governor-president Lajos Kossuth. Inventor Samuel Morse hosted a demonstration of a telegraph machine at Castle Garden in 1835. Around 1845, Castle Garden was converted into a theater when a roof was built above the fort&#x27;s interior. The structure contained 6,000 seats. Officials were planning to expand the nearby Battery Park by 1848, adding landfill around Castle Garden to bring the park to .

In 1850, Swedish soprano Jenny Lind gave her first performances in the United States with two concerts at Castle Gardens; tickets for these concerts cost up to $225 (). A year later, Castle Garden started selling concert tickets at &quot;popular prices&quot; of up to 50 cents (). In the early 1850s, European dancing star Lola Montez performed her &quot;tarantula dance&quot;, and Louis-Antoine Jullien gave dozens of successful concerts mixing classical and light music. The Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company staged the New York premieres of two operas at Castle Garden: Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Marino Faliero&quot; on June 17, 1851, and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Luisa Miller&quot; on July 20, 1854.

The fort was leased to Theodore J. Allen for five years on May 1, 1854. Under the terms of the lease, Allen could expand the island around Castle Garden, but he could not infill the channel between Castle Garden and Battery Park.

== Immigrant landing and registration depot ==

Castle Garden served as the first immigration depot in the U.S. from 1855 to 1890. Most of the fort, except for the section along the shoreline, was surrounded by a wooden fence. The fence, measuring high, was intended to keep out unauthorized immigrants. At the center of the fort was the waiting area, known as the rotunda. The immigrant registration depot included a quadrangle of desks arranged around this waiting area, as well as restrooms flanking the main entrance. The waiting area also had wooden benches. Although there are no precise figures for the capacity of the waiting area, various sources give a capacity of between 2,000 and 4,000. An enclosed balcony was installed around the waiting area circa 1869. The residential outbuildings around the fort became offices.

Before being processed at Castle Garden, immigrants underwent medical inspections at the Marine Hospital on Staten Island, where ill immigrants were quarantined. Those who passed their medical inspection boarded a steamship, which traveled to a dock along the northern side of Castle Garden; the dock faced away from Battery Park, preventing immigrants from entering Manhattan before they had been processed. Immigrants were inspected a second time before entering the fort. Inside the depot, a New York state emigration clerk registered each immigrant and directed them to another desk, where a second clerk advised each immigrant about their destination. Each of the immigrants then received a bottle of bathwater and returned to the dock, where their baggage was collected. The New York Central Railroad and the New York and Erie Railroad sold train tickets at Castle Garden as well.

Many of Castle Garden&#x27;s original immigrant passenger records were stored at Ellis Island, where they were destroyed in a fire in 1897. Sources cite 7.5 million or 8 million immigrants as having been processed at Castle Garden. These account for the vast majority of the nearly 10 million immigrants who passed through the Port of New York between 1847 and 1890. The majority of immigrants processed at Castle Garden were from European countries, namely Denmark, England, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Scotland, and Sweden. The facility&#x27;s name was pronounced by German immigrants and by Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews. The word became a generic term for any situation that was noisy, confusing or chaotic, or where a &quot;&quot; of languages was spoken (a reference to the multitude of languages heard spoken by the immigrants from many countries at the site). In 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that one-sixth of all Americans were descended from an immigrant who had passed through Castle Garden.

=== Conversion and operation ===

==== 1850s and 1860s ====

The New York state government&#x27;s Board of Emigration Commissioners had been established in 1847 to operate medical facilities and a registration center for immigrants. Although the board had acquired the Marine Hospital on Staten Island soon after its establishment, their efforts to open a registration center were unsuccessful for several years. Prior to the establishment of the registration center, unethical ticket-booking agents for transport lines frequently approached newly arrived immigrants, only to abscond with the immigrants&#x27; savings. The board took over Allen&#x27;s lease of Castle Garden in May 1855 and made some modifications, leasing the fort for $8,000 annually (). Several local residents attempted to prevent the fort from being converted into an immigrant registration depot, claiming that the state government&#x27;s lease was illegal and that the newly arrived immigrants would spread disease. A judge for the state&#x27;s Superior Court ruled in June 1855 that work on the immigrant-processing depot could proceed.

The Emigrant Landing Depot opened within the fort on August 1, 1855, and the depot began processing immigrants two days later. The identity of the first migrant processed at the fort is unknown. Of the first five ships to arrive at Castle Garden, English laborer Richard Richards was the first person on the manifest of the largest ship. Although the New York state government endorsed Castle Garden&#x27;s conversion to an immigrant-processing depot, the New York City government opposed the move and accused the Emigration Commissioners of violating the terms of their lease. Many complaints about Castle Garden came from &quot;runners&quot; representing booking agents and boarding house operators, who could not intercept unwitting immigrants because of Castle Garden&#x27;s strict policies. The New York state government&#x27;s initial four-year lease of Castle Garden expired in 1859, and state officials renewed their lease annually for the next ten years. By then, state and city officials could not agree on who owned the depot. The city, state, and federal governments continued to fight over the depot&#x27;s ownership through the 1870s.

Although Castle Garden staff often mistreated immigrants, historian George J. Svejda wrote that the depot &quot;was still the best place for immigrants upon their landing on America&#x27;s shores&quot;. In 1864, to convince immigrants to enlist in the United States Armed Forces during the American Civil War, the County Bounty Committee erected a recruitment center next to Castle Garden. Two years later, the Board of Emigration Commissioners constructed a one-story labor exchange building, a waiting room, and an information office, and they made repairs to Castle Garden. The fort&#x27;s exterior remained largely unchanged over the years, but the interior and many of the fort&#x27;s wooden outbuildings were frequently renovated. Battery Park was expanded circa 1869 using landfill, at which point the island containing Castle Garden was incorporated into the rest of Manhattan Island. The rotunda was extensively restored at this time, and a wooden balcony was installed. By then, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the surrounding Battery Park was &quot;a haven for the &#x27;runners&#x27; who approached innocent Irish and German newcomers, offering them nonexistent lodgings for their money&quot;.

==== 1870s and 1880s ====

By the early 1870s, Castle Garden&#x27;s information bureau employed staff members who could speak over a dozen languages. The New York state government encouraged immigrants to use other ports of entry to reduce overcrowding, so it issued a head tax on every immigrant who passed through Castle Garden. This measure was largely ineffective, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1874: &quot;Castle Garden is so well known in Europe that few emigrants can be induced to sail to any other destination.&quot; By then, the immigration depot was in poor condition, with rotting floors and &quot;tottering&quot; offices and benches. The Board of Emigration Commissioners lost a significant source of income in 1875, when the Supreme Court of the United States invalidated a New York state law that required steamship companies to pay a head tax or put up a bond for each immigrant. Afterward, the commissioners sought funding from the state legislature. Due to budgetary shortfalls, the Emigration Commissioners disbanded the labor bureau in 1875, although the German and Irish Emigrant Societies took over the labor bureau&#x27;s operation. Congress passed the Page Act of 1875, the first restrictive federal immigration law in the United States, during this time.

The structure was severely damaged in a fire on July 30, 1876. Castle Garden&#x27;s exterior remained intact, as did the outbuildings to the north of the fort, but the interior was completely destroyed. In the aftermath of the fire, several city officials proposed shuttering the Castle Garden immigration center and restoring the fort as a venue for &quot;public enjoyment&quot;. Nonetheless, the New York state government awarded a contract for Castle Garden&#x27;s reconstruction in September 1876, and it reopened on November 27, 1876. As part of the $30,000 project (), officials installed windows in the embrasures along the facade, and they added two doorways. After the nearby Barge Office was completed in 1879, immigrants disembarked at the Barge Office, where officers examined immigrants&#x27; baggage. The baggage-collection duties soon returned to Castle Garden, and the Barge Office became a storage area.

New York state officials unsuccessfully attempted to reinstate a head tax at Castle Garden in 1881. The following year, Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1882, which imposed a head tax on non-U.S. citizens who passed through American ports, as well as restricted certain classes of people from immigrating to America. Under the 1882 act, the Emigration Commissioners earned 50 cents for each immigrant who passed through Castle Garden. Later that year, the Emigration Commissioners began collecting rent from the various companies and agents with offices at Castle Garden, and it started collecting taxes from boardinghouse operators. The Immigration Act of 1882 also prompted a jurisdictional dispute between the city, state, and federal governments. For example, in 1885, the state government refused to allocate $10,000 for repairs to the depot&#x27;s ferry dock because the city technically owned Castle Garden. The state government finally provided money for repairs in 1887.

=== Closure ===
By the late 1880s, Castle Garden had become overcrowded and unhygienic, and there were numerous reports that Castle Garden officials were mistreating immigrants. Robert Chesebrough, a businessman who owned several structures around Battery Park, had also advocated for the closure of the Castle Garden processing depot. The &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; wrote that the structure was &quot;a dilapidated rotunda surrounded by equally ramshackle structures for the housing of the strangers on these shores&quot;. The Emigration Commissioners had dismissed many of Castle Garden&#x27;s employees in September 1889 because of declining income, further compounding the facility&#x27;s issues. Federal and state officials also had difficulty sharing jurisdiction of Castle Garden; state officials reportedly did not enforce federal laws, as it was not part of their duties.

The federal government notified New York state officials in February 1890 that it would take over immigrant-processing duties at Castle Garden within sixty days. Federal officials planned to construct a new immigrant-processing center at another location, ultimately selecting a site on Ellis Island. Castle Garden closed on April 18, 1890, The immigrant-processing center was temporarily relocated to the Barge Office. The state&#x27;s Commissioners of Emigration had forbidden the federal government to continue to use Castle Garden until the Ellis Island immigrant depot was completed. The new registration office on Ellis Island was completed in 1892. In its last year of operation, Castle Garden processed 450,394 travelers, 364,086 of whom were immigrants. When the immigrant-registration depot closed, city officials contemplated converting Castle Garden into an &quot;amusement resort&quot;.

The New York state government formally transferred Castle Garden to the city government on December 31, 1890. By the next year, city officials had removed the wooden fence around Castle Garden, and they were planning to demolish the various outbuildings around the fort. The New York Naval Reserve&#x27;s First Battalion considered relocating to Castle Garden at that time, and it subsequently used Castle Garden as a drill hall during the early 1890s.

==Aquarium==

Castle Garden was the site of the New York City Aquarium from 1896 to 1941. The structure was extensively altered and roofed over to a height of several stories, though the original masonry fort remained. When the fort was converted into an aquarium, the adjacent section of Battery Park was extended into the Hudson River. The interior of Castle Garden contained two circular colonnades, which supported a roof with skylights. Above the center of the fort was a green-and-yellow dome, with a verse of Scripture (Habakkuk 1:15) inscribed into the dome&#x27;s base.

The aquarium could accommodate 10,000 fish and other species. At the center of the ground story was a large circular pool surrounded by six smaller elliptical pools. Fish and other marine species were loaded into the aquarium through a doorway at one end of the fort. The perimeter of the aquarium was originally surrounded by about 100 tanks of varying sizes, placed on two levels. The tanks were up to deep, with plate-glass panes and white-tiled surfaces. By 1907, there were seven large tanks at the center of the ground story, 94 large tanks and 26 smaller tanks on the walls, and 30 reserve tanks. The tanks were supplied by fresh water from the New York City water supply system and salt water from the Hudson River. Salt water passed through two bronze filters, while fresh water passed through two copper filters; the four filters could collectively process over per day.

=== Conversion and opening ===
The New York City government had proposed converting Castle Garden into an aquarium in 1891. The following February, the New York State Legislature passed a bill allowing the city government to create an aquarium within Castle Garden. Julius F. Munckwitz Jr. drew up preliminary plans for an aquarium, which he presented to New York City&#x27;s board of park commissioners in mid-1892. The state government voted to allocate $150,000 for the construction of an aquarium within Castle Garden. The aquarium&#x27;s architect of record, H. T. Woodman, reported in April 1894 that several of the tanks were ready for use. During the renovation process, the architect alleged that the tiles in the tanks had not been installed properly, which led to a protracted dispute. The city government allocated another $25,000 for the aquarium&#x27;s completion at the end of 1894 ().

The aquarium was supposed to have been completed by mid-1894, but it did not open for another two years. By mid-1895, the aquarium was delayed by what the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; characterized as &quot;gross stupidity&quot;. For instance, the skylights on the roof acted as a greenhouse that raised the temperature of the water in the tanks, and the saltwater fish in the aquarium were dying off because of the low salinity of the Hudson River. The &quot;Tribune&quot; estimated that these mistakes had increased the project&#x27;s cost by $35,000 (). Local media reported in September 1896 that the aquarium was largely completed. At the time, the tanks contained 45 species, some of which had been in the aquarium for two years. Ultimately, it cost $175,000 to renovate Castle Garden into an aquarium ().

The aquarium opened on December 10, 1896, following a soft opening the previous day. The aquarium attracted thousands of visitors on its opening day, and it averaged over 10,000 visitors per day during its first several months. Visitors were not charged admission, which may have contributed to the aquarium&#x27;s popularity. The aquarium had two million guests within a year, and it had 5.5 million total guests by May 1900.

=== 1900s to 1930s ===

In March 1902, New York state legislators proposed transferring operation of the New York Aquarium to the New York Zoological Society. City officials had suggested the idea to remove political interference from the aquarium&#x27;s operation. The New York City Board of Estimate authorized mayor Seth Low to lease the aquarium to the Zoological Society in July 1902, and the Zoological Society took over on October 31, 1902, with Charles Haskins Townsend as the aquarium&#x27;s director. Townsend soon made several modifications to Castle Garden&#x27;s facilities. He covered the tanks&#x27; tiled surfaces with rocks, as well as reconfiguring each of the tanks&#x27; pipes to reduce energy usage. The Zoological Society added a classroom next to the fort, and it installed a tank underneath the fort to store saltwater. The organization also repainted the interior for the first time in Castle Garden&#x27;s history. These modifications cost over $30,000 (). The fort&#x27;s design continued to pose issues; for example, aquarium officials discovered in 1905 that the roof skylights were causing some of the fish to become blind. The Zoological Society installed new pipes at Castle Garden in 1908.

Meanwhile, by the early 20th century, city officials were planning to rebuild Battery Park, and they considered replacing Castle Garden with a skyscraper. By January 1911, officials instead planned to expand Castle Garden, adding semicircular wings to the west and east for over $1 million. Each wing was to contain three tiers of tanks and classroom space. The Zoological Society asked the Board of Estimate to allocate $1.75 million to the renovation, but the board still had not funded the renovation of Castle Garden by 1916. Townsend said the aquarium&#x27;s mechanical facilities needed major upgrades; according to Townsend, the mechanical equipment under the fort was flooded at high tide, and power was provided by coal bunkers, which had to be manually replenished every four days. In addition, the fort had never been properly renovated for the aquarium&#x27;s use, and the second story&#x27;s wooden frame was flammable. Townsend said the annexes would not only provide additional exhibition space but also allow the mechanical facilities to be upgraded.

In 1921, Townsend announced that the Zoological Society would spend $75,000 () to construct an electric plant in the basement, replacing a steam plant on the south side of the fort, and then install two tanks in the space formerly occupied by the steam plant. This work was funded by a bequest from Mrs. Russell Sage. The same year, a bust of Jenny Lind was dedicated and installed at the center of the fort. The Board of Estimate voted in December 1921 to provide $105,000 for the construction of an additional story atop the fort. By early 1923, the Zoological Society was carrying out the renovations at a cost of $86,000 (). In June 1923, the board voted to give $76,500 for the construction of an additional story above the fort. The Zoological Society planned to add deeper tanks on the second floor, expanding exhibition space by 20 percent. By then, the aquarium had two million annual visitors. The expansion was largely completed by early 1924.

Townsend announced in 1926 that Castle Garden would undergo further modifications at a cost of $225,000 (). The plans included constructing a third story for workrooms and laboratory space, installing tanks behind the fort, adding a new mechanical plant in the basement, and covering the facade with a gray cement finish. Several local residents expressed opposition to these modifications and created the Battery Park Association to advocate against the plans. By the late 1920s, there were plans to reconstruct Battery Park into a formal vista. As part of this plan, an amphitheater would have been constructed in the southern end of Battery Park, complementing Castle Garden at the northern end. The Castle Garden Aquarium remained popular in the 1930s, with two million visitors per year. Two laboratories were built on the structure&#x27;s third story in 1940, and a new metal dome was installed above the fort the same year. By then, the aquarium&#x27;s acting director Charles M. Breder Jr. wished to develop a new building nearby, as he believed the aquarium had outgrown Castle Garden.

== Demolition attempts and preservation ==

=== Initial plans ===
In February 1941, Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Commissioner Robert Moses announced that he would demolish Castle Garden when the park was rebuilt during the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel&#x27;s construction. He justified the demolition by saying that the fort had poor lighting and ventilation and that it required extensive repairs. In response, the New-York Historical Society proposed restoring the fort and turning it into a maritime museum. George McAneny, a former mayor and the chairman of the Regional Plan Association&#x27;s board, proposed restoring Castle Garden; he continued to advocate the fort&#x27;s preservation for nine years. Moses opposed efforts to preserve Castle Garden, saying that the old fort &quot;never fired a shot&quot;. The city government closed the New York Aquarium and moved some fish and turtles to other aquariums in late 1941; other fish were released into the Atlantic Ocean. A new aquarium was ultimately built on Coney Island in 1957.

Moses presented plans for a reconstruction of Battery Park to the Board of Estimate in March 1942, in which the fort was to be replaced by a landscaped promenade. The board voted in favor of removing the fort from Battery Park that June. City officials quickly placed the fort for sale, allowing potential buyers to preserve the fort by relocating it, but the officials rejected the sole bid from a Brooklyn junkyard operator who offered $1,120 (). The Fine Arts Federation of New York held an architectural design competition in August 1942, soliciting plans for a renovation of Castle Garden. Despite ongoing disputes over the fort&#x27;s fate, workers began removing metal from Castle Garden on September 25, while the rest of the building remained in place for the time being. The fort&#x27;s original door, attached to the wall using 768 iron bolts, was also removed.

An engineer hired by Moses to conduct a structural survey of Fort Clinton reported a &quot;pronounced vertical crack&quot; on the fort&#x27;s walls. Preservationists asked a New York state judge to grant an injunction to prevent demolition, but a judge declined the request in April 1943. Preservationists again petitioned the Board of Estimate to preserve the building, but the board voted in October 1945 to demolish the fort.

=== Preservation as national monument ===

Albert S. Bard, Walter D. Binger, and other civic reformers continued to advocate in favor of preserving the fort. In July 1946, U.S. representative Sol Bloom introduced a bill to designate Castle Garden as a U.S. national monument. Both the House and the Senate approved the legislation, and president Harry S. Truman signed the bill into law on August 12, 1946, enabling the United States Department of the Interior to determine whether to take over the fort. At the time, the city government still owned the property, and the fort could not become a national monument unless the federal government took ownership. Engineers estimated that it would cost between $40,000 and $100,000 to preserve the fort while the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel was being constructed. The city government would only retain the fort if the federal government agreed to pay for its restoration, though Moses did suggest constructing a monument on the site. After the United States Congress declined to allocate funding for Fort Clinton&#x27;s renovation, the Board of Estimate voted yet again to demolish the fort in July 1947. Some demolition work did take place, but the structure was not totally demolished due to a lack of funding.

After Interior undersecretary Oscar L. Chapman indicated in August 1947 that Congress would allocate money to the project in 1948, the board voted to delay further action for one year. In the meantime, the city allocated $50,000 () to shore up the fort&#x27;s southeastern corner while the tunnel was being built. In March 1948, a New York State Assembly committee refused to vote on a bill that would have allowed the federal government to take over Fort Clinton. Two months later, the Board of Estimate voted to demolish the castle for the sixth time. The American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society continued to advocate for the fort&#x27;s preservation, asking the New York Supreme Court to restrict the city from demolishing Fort Clinton in July 1948. The state Supreme Court issued an injunction that December, requiring the New York City Art Commission to approve any proposal to demolish the fort, but the Supreme Court&#x27;s Appellate Division struck down this injunction in March 1949.

By early 1949, U.S. president Harry S. Truman had also expressed support for preserving Fort Clinton. The Assembly voted in March 1949 to cede the fort to the federal government, and the New York State Senate passed an identical bill. New York governor Thomas E. Dewey signed the bill the next month, allowing the city to transfer the fort to the federal government. Separately, the New York City Council voted to allow the New York state government to take over Fort Clinton if the federal government did not want to take over ownership. The U.S. House voted in October to allocate $165,750 for the fort&#x27;s restoration (), allowing the National Park Service (NPS) to start restoring the fort after the federal government gained ownership. The city&#x27;s mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer supported the fort&#x27;s preservation, but, due to legal technicalities, the city government did not transfer ownership of the fort for several months. On July 18, 1950, the city deeded the land and castle to the federal government.

== Federal government ownership ==
The modern-day Castle Clinton is a one-story structure with a radius of . The roof above the fort&#x27;s interior has largely been removed, and there is a nearly circular, open-air parade ground at the center of the fort. It is surrounded by a wall measuring thick. The stucco on the facade was removed under the National Park Service&#x27;s ownership, and the brownstone-and-ashlar exterior walls were restored to their original condition. Underneath the walls is a rough stone foundation. The circumference of the fort contains a portico with wooden columns surrounding a canopy. There is also a gravel courtyard, brick powder magazines, and two subterranean water tanks covered by wooden trapdoors. The SeaGlass Carousel is just southeast of the modern-day fort.

Since 1986, the fort&#x27;s interior has housed an information kiosk and ticket booths for the Statue of Liberty National Monument, which comprises the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island; the fort continues to sell tickets for the Statue of Liberty National Monument . Statue Cruises, which operates the only ferry line to Liberty Island and Ellis Island, sells ferry tickets inside the fort. Admission to Castle Clinton itself is free, and the National Park Service gives guided tours when the monument is open to the public. The fort also contains a small history exhibit and occasionally hosts concerts. The nonprofit Battery Conservancy is also housed within Castle Clinton. According to the NPS, Castle Clinton typically has over three million visitors a year, making it one of the most visited national monuments in the United States.

=== Restoration ===

The Castle Clinton National Monument was formally dedicated on October 24, 1950. Battery Park reopened to the public two years later, although Castle Clinton had not yet been restored at the time. The NPS announced in early 1952 that it would begin restoring the fort&#x27;s exterior; the project was expected to cost $117,000 () and take two years. As part of this project, the NPS reconstructed the fort&#x27;s original door. Following the partial demolition of Fort Clinton in the 1940s, only the exterior wall remained intact. The interior of the fort was so dilapidated that, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;not even grass grew in the desolate, cratered parade ground&quot;.

In 1954, the New York City Council passed a resolution asking Congress to establish a committee to provide suggestions for restoring Castle Clinton, the Federal Hall National Memorial, and the Statue of Liberty National Monument. The next year, the federal government created the New York City National Shrines Advisory Board. The board first convened in February 1956, and the federal government allocated $498,500 that July for a renovation of Castle Clinton (). In February 1957, the board recommended allocating $3 million for the restoration of the three sites. The United States Department of the Interior subsequently postponed the repair project to 1966. This led architect Frederick G. Frost Jr. to propose in 1958 that the fort be renovated for use as a maritime museum and a restaurant. In 1962, New York City parks commissioner Newbold Morris proposed relocating 18 columns from the soon-to-be-demolished Pennsylvania Station to a promenade outside Castle Clinton. This never happened, and the columns were instead dumped in a landfill in New Jersey.

Castle Clinton was one of the earliest buildings that the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) considered protecting as a New York City landmark. The LPC designated the fort as a city landmark in November 1965, seven months after the city&#x27;s landmarks law was signed. Subsequently, Castle Clinton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, the day the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 went into effect.

A restoration of Castle Clinton commenced in August 1968. The work included restoring the exterior and interior walls; adding a shingle roof; removing a moat and other facilities related to the fort&#x27;s use as an aquarium; and repairing officers&#x27; quarters, parade ground, and ammunition storage areas. This renovation was supposed to last one year. The federal government postponed funding for further restoration because of the Vietnam War. The NPS commenced a wider-ranging restoration project 1972, which cost about $750,000 (). As part of this project, the officers&#x27; quarters were restored, and an exhibit was placed inside a former powder magazine. Preservationists were advocating for Castle Clinton to be used as a performing-arts center by late 1972. The following June, the fort hosted its first concert since the 1850s, a performance commemorating Jenny Lind. Castle Clinton reopened on May 25, 1975, with a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th by the American Symphony Orchestra. City and federal officials rededicated the monument the next month.

=== Use as national monument ===

==== 1970s to 1990s ====

When it reopened, Castle Clinton hosted concerts for the public during summer weekends, and it also hosted exhibits and guided tours. The fort contained dioramas depicting Manhattan at various points in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1979, the NPS and the Manhattan Cultural Council commissioned four sculptures, which were installed within Castle Clinton&#x27;s central courtyard. Following a series of thefts and break-ins at Castle Clinton in the early 1980s, the NPS stationed several armed guards outside the fort. In the decade after it was rededicated, the fort was open nine months a year, operating five days per week. NPS officials estimated that the fort had no more than 100,000 annual visitors.

The NPS closed Castle Clinton for renovations in December 1985. It announced plans to install two ticket booths and a waiting area for ferries to the Statue of Liberty National Monument. The NPS planned to spend $1.5 million to replace two structures, add exhibitions, restore the roof and parade ground, and reconstruct a doorway that had been sealed in 1974. The fort was to operate every day of the week, year-round, though the NPS subsequently decided to close all national monuments in Manhattan on Sundays. The NPS expected that the fort would attract up to five million visitors a year. A ferry pier was also installed behind Castle Clinton. The fort reopened the weekend of July 4, 1986, as a visitor center and ticket office for the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Castle Clinton also began selling ferry tickets to Ellis Island in 1990, when that island&#x27;s main building was converted into a museum.

By 1996, the Conservancy for Historic Battery Park was raising $350,000 () for a seasonal tensile structure, to be placed above the fort between April and October of each year. The conservancy wished to raise another $25 million to $30 million and convert Castle Clinton into an educational and cultural center. This was part of a $5.5 million renovation of the adjacent waterfront promenade within Battery Park, which was completed in November 2001, although the tensile structure was not installed. The Battery Park Conservancy had selected Thomas Phifer in 2001 to redesign Castle Clinton as a performing-arts center, but the redesign was stalled for several years.

==== 2000s to present ====

The National Guard occupied Castle Clinton for six weeks after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Castle Clinton reopened to the public on October 22, 2001, though the ferries to the Statue of Liberty National Monument were not operating at the time. That December, the NPS erected a tent with seven body scanners at Castle Clinton, where visitors to the Statue of Liberty National Monument underwent a security screening. The facility could not handle large crowds, often resulting in waits of more than one hour. The NPS considered relocating the security-screening facilities to the nearby City Pier A in 2003 but decided against it. Although the security tent in front of Castle Clinton had been intended as a temporary measure, it remained in place for more than a decade. The security screening facilities were supposed to have been relocated to Ellis Island in 2013; , the screening facilities were located southeast of Castle Clinton.

During excavations for the nearby South Ferry station in late 2005, builders found the remains of a stone wall dating from the late 17th or 18th centuries. Workers subsequently found another wall under the site, and the NPS exhibited part of one of the walls inside Castle Clinton. , Castle Clinton remains a visitor center and ticket office for the Statue of Liberty National Monument.

<text>Unione Sportiva Livorno 1915 (formerly A.S. Livorno Calcio, commonly known as Livorno), is a semi-professional Italian football club based in Livorno, Tuscany. They compete in Serie D, the top tier of semi-professional Italian football after their promotion from the regional Eccellenza Tuscany league. The team&#x27;s colour is dark red ( in Italian, from which the team nickname derives). Livorno were one of the original sides of Serie A, the top flight of Italian football, but have been relegated seven times from the top flight and have undergone two club refoundings in 1991 and 2021, necessitating a rise from the regional Eccellenza leagues. Their longest spells in the top division were from 1940 to 1949 (accounting for seven seasons) and from 2004 to 2008. The &quot;amaranto&quot; have won Serie B on two occasions, the Lega Pro Prima Divisione and Lega Pro Seconda Divisione once each, and the Supercoppa di Serie C once as well. Livorno play their home matches at the Stadio Armando Picchi.

==History==
Founded on 15 February 1915, the club ended the Italian Football Championship 1919–20 in second place, losing the final to Internazionale. One year later, they were defeated in the semi-final by arch-rivals Pisa. In 1933, the club moved to the current stadium, originally named after Edda Ciano Mussolini, daughter of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Livorno was one of the original Serie A teams. They played at top level during periods of 1929–31, 1933–35 and 1937–39. Successively, Livorno ended as Serie A runners-up in the 1942–43 season, finishing after Torino. Livorno left Serie A in 1949 after seven consecutive seasons. They were relegated to Serie C soon after (1951–52 season), making a return to Serie B in 1955 for a single season and again from 1964 to 1972. They were relegated to Serie C2 in 1982–83 and played again in the third level between 1984 and 1989. The club was then canceled in 1991, being forced to start from Eccellenza; two consecutive promotions led the team back to Serie C2. The club was promoted to Serie C1 in 1997 and was acquired by Aldo Spinelli two years later. Under the new property, Livorno returned to Serie B in 2001.

Livorno was promoted to Serie A after finishing third in the Serie B 2003–04, one of six clubs to be promoted that season. It had been 55 years since Livorno&#x27;s last season in the top flight, and as a result of this, most were predicting an instant return to Serie B for the club. The first match in the major league was attended by Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a Livorno citizen and team supporter in his childhood. There were spells of struggle during the season, but there were many more good performances shown, and Livorno finished a surprise and creditable ninth place in the league for the Serie A 2004–05, also thanks to goals by striker Cristiano Lucarelli, who won the Serie A top scorer award that season, outscoring even the likes of Andriy Shevchenko and Adriano.

The Serie A 2005–06 saw Livorno in sixth place after the first half of the season the team, being involved for qualification to the next UEFA Cup. Shortly after, Roberto Donadoni announced his resignation after having been criticized by club&#x27;s chairman Aldo Spinelli. Donadoni was replaced by veteran coach Carlo Mazzone, who was only able to save a UEFA Cup place due to the expulsion of three teams from Europe in the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal. Mazzone then saw his team suffer a run of seven straight defeats. In May 2006, Daniele Arrigoni was appointed the new coach for the next season.

In the Serie A 2006–07 season, Livorno took part in the UEFA Cup for the first time. The Tuscan side was drawn to face the Austrian team SV Pasching in the first round, beating them comfortably 3–0 on aggregate. They thus qualified for the group stages being drawn in Group A, along with Rangers, Auxerre, FK Partizan, and Maccabi Haifa. After a home loss to Rangers (2–3) and two 1–1 draws against Partizan in Belgrade (where goalkeeper Marco Amelia scored in the 87th minute) and Maccabi (in Livorno), the Tuscan side gained a 1–0 victory over Auxerre in the last game played in France, thus earning a spot in the Round of 32 of the competition. However, the Spanish team Espanyol knocked out Livorno from the UEFA Cup by winning 4–1 on aggregate.

After day 19 of the Serie A, Arrigoni was sacked by chairman Spinelli, but his position was kept due to the strong opposition by the team. His dismissal was, however, only delayed, as Arrigoni was eventually fired on 21 March 2007, and replaced by Fernando Orsi, who managed to keep the team away from the relegation battle. For the 2007–08 campaign, Orsi was confirmed as head coach and a number of notable signings such as Francesco Tavano, Diego Tristan and Vikash Dhorasoo were finalised, but also the transfer of Lucarelli to Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk. The club, however, did not start well, making a mere two points in the first seven matches, and Orsi was sacked on 9 October and replaced by Giancarlo Camolese. Despite showing some positive signals at the beginning, Livorno found himself again at the bottom of league table. On 28 April 2008, Camolese was fired as Orsi was re-appointed, but in the penultimate day of the season, the team could not avoid relegation, due to a 1–0 home defeat against Torino. They finished last in the Serie A standings of the 2007–08 season. Thus, being relegated to Serie B. They finished Serie B as the third place team in 2008–09 season and returned to Serie A after winning promotion play-offs after defeating successively Grosseto with a 4–3 aggregate score and Brescia with a 5–2 aggregate score. However, this return was short-lived and one season later they relegated again to Serie B after finishing last. Livorno were promoted again after they beat Empoli 2–1 on aggregate to get the Serie A promotion.

In the 2019–20 season of Serie B, Livorno ended up last, leading them to be relegated to Serie C. In the 2020–21 Serie C season, Livorno finished in last place with 29 points following a five-point deduction due to failure to pay player wages on time, and was relegated to Serie D. However, due to the club&#x27;s bankruptcy, they could not pay the admission fee for Serie D and disbanded.

The club joined the Eccellenza Toscana for the 2021-22 season under the new denomination of Unione Sportiva Livorno 1915 and the ownership of former Prato chairman Paolo Toccafondi. In the 2021-22 season, Livorno finished first in Group B of the Eccellenza Toscana, but were narrowly defeated in the national playoffs by S.S.D. Pomezia Calcio. However, Livorno were later admitted back to Serie D in place of Figline, who were barred from promotion after throwing a game against Tau Calcio Altopascio which influenced the promotion tournament seeding. In their first Serie D season, Livorno finished 5th of 18 teams in Group E.

==Supporters==


Livorno&#x27;s supporters are well known for their left-wing politics which often spark fiercely violent clashes with opposing right-wing supporter groups, especially those of Lazio and Verona. Former Lazio striker Paolo Di Canio once made a Roman salute to his own fans during a match against Livorno, when tensions were running high between the two clubs&#x27; &quot;ultra&quot; groups.

Since 2005, a group of migrant Livorno supporters resident in northern Europe have styled themselves (). A so-called &quot;triangle of brotherhood&quot; has developed between the most heavily supported left-wing fan clubs of Marseille, Livorno, and AEK Athens, namely between Commando Ultras 84, Brigate Autonome Livornesi 99, and Original 21. Their connection is mostly an ideological one. They also have a connection with Adana Demirspor (Şimşekler) and Celtic.

<text>PACX (Private Automatic Computer eXchange) was a name given by Gandalf Technologies to their family of data switching products.

==Architecture==
The PACX was a centralized switch that allowed serial connections from end users to be connected to any one of a number of computers, typically mainframes. Users were equipped with small boxes with two thumbwheels on them, and by rolling the wheels to a given two-digit number they could select among the machines connected to the PACX. In typical setups, the PACX would be connected to computer terminals or modems. The switch box would be queried on connection for the user&#x27;s selection, and then a direct connection would be made between the user and that machine. The system was not unlike the telephone network, and the name PACX was deliberately chosen to suggest a computer-side analog of the PABX market.

==Background==
The PACX, with its mainframe utility, was part of an era in which enterprise data services were seen to the province of an Office Controller. The Office Controller was envisaged as a central switch which would interconnect and create all applications and make them available to users. PABX manufacturers of that era (the 1980s) created suites of data applications for the connection of users to mainframe applications. There were even magazine articles touting the victory of the PABX as an Office Controller over its LAN rivals. The PACX was a data PABX without the voice capability.

With the development of LANs and cheap PCs with their attendant client/server applications, the Office Controller vision faded away. However the idea is not without merit. It is being re-established in new guises with the development of SIP with Session Border Controllers and Service Oriented Architectures.

<text>Data diddling is a type of cybercrime in which data is altered as it is entered into a computer system, most often by a data entry clerk or a computer virus. Computerized processing of the altered data results in a fraudulent benefit. In some cases, the altered data is changed back after processing to conceal the activity. The results can be huge. They might include adjusting financial figures up or down marginally, or it could be more complex and make an entire system unusable.

<text>Von brigði is a remix album of Icelandic band Sigur Rós&#x27; first album, &quot;Von&quot;. It was released in 1998 on Smekkleysa Records, and continues to be available only in Iceland or through the band&#x27;s online store. An LP containing four tracks from the album was also released, although only 100 copies of this green-colored edition were made.

&quot;Von brigði&quot;&#x27;s title is a play on words. The word &quot;Vonbrigði&quot; means &quot;disappointment&quot;, but split in two it translates as &quot;variations on Von&quot;, &quot;brigði&quot; meaning &quot;variation&quot;. A full translation into English would result in &quot;hope variation&quot;.

The last song on the album is a song by Sigur Rós which the band meant to go on &quot;Von&quot;, but couldn&#x27;t be finished in time.

<text>Siena Football Club Società Sportiva Dilettantistica, commonly referred to as Siena, is an Italian football club based in Siena, Tuscany. The club was re-incorporated in 2020 after the bankruptcy of the previous legal entity Robur Siena, which itself was the reincarnation of the original club Associazione Calcio Siena S.p.A.. A.C. Siena&#x27;s predecessor was founded in 1904.

Siena plays its home games at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. The ground&#x27;s capacity is 15,373 and is located in the centre of Siena.

==History==
Formed in 1904 as Società Studio e Divertimento (&quot;Society for Study and Entertainment&quot;), as a sports club characterised by a black and white striped jersey which was derived from the city of Siena coat of arms. It founded its football club, named Società Sportiva Robur in 1908. Today, the name &quot;Robur&quot; is widely used by the local supporters to distinguish itself from the two basketball teams, &quot;Mens Sana&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

The team finally became known as Associazione Calcio Siena (A.C. Siena) in 1933–34. In 1934–35, Siena were promoted for the first time to Serie B. In the post-war 1945–46 season, Siena played in the top division of Italian football for the first time. During that season, a mixed wartime league was composed of both Serie A and Serie B teams. Some of the southern sides that took part in the top division, including Siena, were Serie B teams, while northern Serie B teams played at the second level with the Serie C teams. Therefore, although Siena played in the top division, it was not considered as having officially played in Serie A during that season and not having qualified for the National Round. Siena won the fourth tier league championship in 1955–56 as the Scudetto IV Serie.

After having spent 55 years playing in several lower divisions, Siena were promoted back to Serie B for the start of the 2000–01 season. Following a good first up season in Serie B, the following season saw Siena in serious trouble and coach Giuseppe Papadopulo was sacked, although he would later be recalled and was able to save the club from relegation on the season&#x27;s final matchday.

The following season, again with Papadopulo as head coach, Siena were promoted to Serie A for the first time officially, led by players such as Rodrigo Taddei and Pinga. Their return marked 58 years since their last appearance in the top division of Italian football.

In the 2003–04 campaign, the first Serie A season in the club&#x27;s history, Siena finished in a respectable 13th place.

In the 2004–05 Serie A campaign, with Luigi De Canio as head coach, Siena struggled for long periods of the season, languishing in the relegation zone for a great part of the campaign, and with the team drawing far too many games and barely recording any wins, they looked almost certain to be relegated. However, a resurgence of form towards of the end of the season gave them hope, and a 2–1 win against already relegated Atalanta on the last day saw them secure safety and an acceptable 14th place in the table.

The 2005–06 season also saw Siena fighting hard and it successfully kept its place in Serie A. They ended the season in 17th place. For the 2006–07 season, Mario Beretta, who led Parma during the previous season, was appointed as new head coach. He kept Siena in Serie A after a 2–1 home win against Lazio in the final matchday.

During the 2006–07 season, club chairman Paolo De Luca, who took over in 2001 and helped the club to their first historical Serie A promotion, started talks to sell the club to a conglomerate of Tuscan businessmen led by Giovanni Lombardi Stronati, chairman of Valle del Giovenco. The bid was finalised on 30 March 2007, one day before De Luca died after a long illness.

The head coach for the 2007–08 campaign was expected to be Andrea Mandorlini, but he left the club by mutual consent on 12 November. Former coach Mario Beretta once again took charge.

The club also explored the possibility of changing its denomination to include the name of their main sponsor, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena. On 9 July 2007, the club announced it had changed their denomination to &quot;A.C. Siena Montepaschi&quot;. However, the name change needed to be accepted by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) to become official: After the refusal by FIGC, this idea was abandoned.

The club was then acquired by Massimo Mezzaroma, with Valentina Mezzaroma as vice-chairman. On 7 May 2011, Siena were once again promoted to Serie A after finishing second in the 2010–11 Serie B. The club&#x27;s stint into the top flight lasted two seasons, as they were relegated after ending the 2012–13 Serie A in 19th place.

Siena failed to register for 2014–15 Serie B on 15 July 2014, later announcing their bankruptcy. Former A.C. Siena chairman Massimo Mezzaroma was also sued by the prosecutor for false accounting in player swap (Rossi–Galuppo) Eventually the club and Mezzaroma were inadmissible from the charge due to expiry of the legal proceeding. Nevertheless, Guardia di Finanza seized €8.5 million from Mezzaroma for charges related to the bankruptcy.

In July 2014, thanks to the article 52 of N.O.I.F., the club was refounded under new legal person &quot;società sportiva dilettantistica&quot; Robur Siena, restarting from 2014–15 Serie D. It was promoted to 2015–16 Lega Pro as champions of Group E in June 2015.

In the 2015–16 season, Robur won the regional derby against Pisa at the Garibaldi Arena after 57 years and qualified for semifinal of Coppa Italia Lega Pro against Foggia, winning the first leg at home, 5–2.

Due to the non-admission of Avellino, Bari and Cesena, Siena became one of the repechage candidates to 2018–19 Serie B on 1 August 2018. Siena finished as the runner-up in the 2017–18 Serie C promotion playoffs, as well as runner-up in the group stage, losing to Cosenza and Livorno respectively. However, after lengthy legal battles, Serie B decided to leave the 3 spots vacated.

Siena failed to register to Serie C after the end of the 2019–20 season, and the club was successively refounded as ACN Siena 1904 under the ownership of an Armenian group owning Armenian Premier League football club FC Noah. The club was then readmitted to Serie C in 2021 to fill a vacancy, and then sold to Italian group Global Service in June 2022. The club was subsequently renamed to Associazione Calcio Robur Siena 1904. By the end of the 2022–23 season, Siena was excluded from professional football for the third time in less than a decade due to outstanding debts. The Mayor of Siena subsequently handed the sports title to Atlas Consulting srl, former owners of Triestina, who will lead the new club in the Eccellenza league.

==Colours and badge==
The team&#x27;s home colours are black and white.

==Anthem==

The official anthem is Franco Baldi&#x27;s &quot;Su Forza Siena&quot;. Other historic city anthems such as the Canto della Verbena and the Marcia del Palio are often sung by local fans during the matches.

<doc id="1135907" wikidata="Q1625903" url="?curid=1135907" title="HomePlug">
<text>HomePlug is the family name for various power line communications specifications under the HomePlug designation, each with unique capabilities and compatibility with other HomePlug specifications.

Some HomePlug specifications target broadband applications. For instance in-home distribution of low data rate IPTV, gaming, and Internet content, while others focus on low power, low throughput and extended operating temperatures for applications such as smart power meters and in-home communications between electric systems and appliances. All of the HomePlug specifications were developed by the HomePlug Powerline Alliance, which also owns the HomePlug trademark.

On 18 October 2016 the HomePlug Alliance announced that all of its specifications would be put into the public domain and that other organizations would be taking on future activities relating to deployment of the existing technologies. There was no mention in the announcement of any further technology development within the HomePlug community.

==HomePlug Powerline Alliance==

The HomePlug Powerline Alliance is a trade association of electronics manufacturers, service providers, and retailers that establishes standards for, and tests members&#x27; devices for compliance to, the various HomePlug power line communication technologies. The alliance tests for interoperability and certifies products based on HomePlug specifications and IEEE 1901 standards.

On 18 October 2016, the HomePlug Alliance announced that all of its specifications would be put into the public domain and that other organizations would be taking on future activities relating to deployment of the existing technologies. There was no mention in the announcement of any further technology development within the HomePlug community. Homeplug is essentially defunct as of at least June 2022

==History==
The HomePlug Powerline Alliance was formed to develop standards and technology for enabling devices to communicate with each other and the Internet over existing structure/house electrical wiring.

One of the greatest technical challenges was finding a way to reduce sensitivity to the electrical noise present on power lines. HomePlug solved this problem by increasing the communication carrier frequencies so that the signal is conveyed by the neutral conductor which is common to all phases.

Founded in 2000, the HomePlug Powerline Alliance&#x27;s goal was to create a standard to use existing home electrical wiring to communicate between products and connect to the Internet. The first HomePlug specification HomePlug 1.0 was released in June 2001. The HomePlug AV (for audio-video) specification released in 2005 increased physical layer (PHY) peak data rates from approximately 13.0 Mbit/s to 200 Mbit/s.

The HomePlug Green PHY specification was released in June 2010 and targets Smart Energy and Smart Grid applications as an interoperable &quot;sibling&quot; to HomePlug AV with lower cost, lower power consumption and decreased throughput. It approved and published the HomePlug Command and Control specification in 2007 and the HomePlug Green PHY specification in June 2010.

The 2010 IEEE 1901 was approved and HomePlug AV as baseline technology for the FFT-OFDM PHY within the standard and became an international standard. The HomePlug Powerline Alliance is a certifying body for IEEE 1901 products. The three major specifications published by HomePlug (HomePlug AV, HomePlug Green PHY and HomePlug AV2) are interoperable and compliant.

The organization had 69 members and had certified over 200 products as of 2010.

In 2011, the HomePlug Green PHY specification was adopted by Ford, General Motors, Audi, BMW, Daimler, Porsche, and Volkswagen, as a connectivity standard for Plug-In Electrical Vehicle.

As of 2017, there are at least six chip vendors shipping HomePlug AV chipsets with IEEE 1901 specification support: Broadcom, Qualcomm Atheros, Sigma Designs, Intellon, SPiDCOM, and MStar.

Newer versions of HomePlug support the use of Ethernet in bus topology via OFDM modulation, which enables several distinct data carriers to coexist in the same wire. Also, HomePlug&#x27;s OFDM technology can turn off (mask) any sub-carriers that overlap previously allocated radio spectrum in a given geographic region, thus preventing interference. In North America, for instance, HomePlug AV only uses 917 of 1155 sub-carriers.

==Usage==
Powerline networking is a network that can be set up using a building&#x27;s existing electrical wiring. For electric vehicle charging, the SAE J1772 standard plug-in electric vehicle charger also requires HomePlug Green PHY to establish communications over a powerline before the vehicle can begin to draw any charging power.

All commercial HomePlug implementations meet the AES-128 encryption standard specified for advanced metering infrastructure by the US FERC. Accordingly, these devices are suitable to deploy as utility grade meters off the shelf with appropriate software.

As of late 2012, the most widely deployed HomePlug devices are &quot;adapters&quot;, which are standalone modules that plug into wall outlets (or power strips [but not surge protectors] or extension cords) and provide one or more Ethernet ports. In a simple home network, the Internet gateway router connects via Ethernet cable to a powerline adapter, which in turn plugs into a nearby power outlet. A second adapter, plugged into any other outlet in the home, connects via Ethernet cable to any Ethernet device (e.g., computer, printer, IP phone, gaming station). Communications between the router and Ethernet devices are then conveyed over existing home electrical wiring. More complex networks can be implemented by plugging in additional adapters as needed. A powerline adapter may also be plugged into a hub or switch so that it supports multiple Ethernet devices residing in a common room.

Increasingly, the functionality found in standalone adapters is being built into end devices such as power control centers, digital media adapters, and Internet security cameras. It is anticipated that powerline networking functionality will be embedded in TVs, set-top boxes, DVRs, and other consumer electronics, especially with the emergence of global powerline networking standards such as the IEEE 1901 standard, ratified in September 2010.

Several manufacturers sell devices that include 802.11n, HomePlug and four ports of Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for under US$100. Several are announced for early 2013 that also include 802.11ac connectivity, the combination of which with HomePlug is sold by Qualcomm Atheros as its Hy-Fi hybrid networking technology, an implementation of IEEE P1905. This permits a device to use wired Ethernet, powerline or wireless communication as available to provide a redundant and reliable failover thought to be particularly important in consumer applications where there is no onsite expertise typically available to debug connections.

==Versions==
===HomePlug 1.0===
The first HomePlug specification, HomePlug 1.0, provides a peak PHY-rate of 14 Mbit/s. It was first introduced in June, 2001 and has since been replaced by HomePlug AV. On May 28, 2008 Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) incorporated HomePlug 1.0 powerline technology into the newly published TIA-1113 international standard. TIA-1113 defines modem operations on user-premises electrical wiring. The new standard is the world&#x27;s first multi-megabit powerline communications standard approved by an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-accredited organization.

The HomePlug 1.0 MAC Layer uses channel access based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to transport data from 46 to 1500 bytes long from encapsulated IEEE 802.3 frames as MAC Service Data Units (MSDUs) (so doesn&#x27;t support jumbo frames).

HomePlug 1.0 Turbo adapters comply with the HomePlug 1.0 specification but employ a faster, proprietary mode that increases the peak PHY-rate to 85 Mbit/s. HomePlug 1.0 Turbo modems were only available from Intellon Corporation.

===HomePlug AV===
The HomePlug AV specification, which was introduced in August 2005, provides sufficient bandwidth for applications such as HDTV and VoIP. HomePlug AV offers a peak data rate of 200 Mbit/s at the physical layer, and about 80 Mbit/s at the MAC layer. HomePlug AV devices are required to coexist, and optionally to interoperate, with HomePlug 1.0 devices. The physical layer uses OFDM carriers spaced at 24.414 kHz, with carriers from 2 to 30 MHz. Depending on the signal to noise ratio, the system automatically selects from BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM, 64 QAM, 256 QAM, and 1024 QAM, on a carrier by carrier basis.

Utilizing adaptive modulation on up to 1155 OFDM sub-carriers, turbo convolution codes for error correction, two-level MAC framing with ARQ, and other techniques, HomePlug AV can achieve near the theoretical maximum bandwidth across a given transmission path. For security reasons, the specification includes key distribution techniques and the use of 128 bit AES encryption. Furthermore, the specification&#x27;s adaptive techniques present inherent obstacles to eavesdropping and cyber attacks.

Some Qualcomm Atheros-based adapters comply with the HomePlug AV specification but employ a proprietary extension that increases the PHY-rate to 500 Mbit/s primarily by using a wider spectrum.

===HomePlug AV2===
The HomePlug AV2 specification was introduced in January 2012. It is interoperable with HomePlug AV and HomePlug GreenPHY devices and is IEEE 1901 standard compliant. It features gigabit-class PHY-rate, support for MIMO PHY, repeating functionalities and power saving modes.

===HomePlug Green PHY===
The HomePlug Green PHY specification is a subset of HomePlug AV that is intended for use in the smart grid. It has peak rates of 10 Mbit/s and is designed to go into smart meters and smaller appliances such as HVAC thermostats, home appliances and plug-in electric vehicles so that data can be shared over a home network and with the power utility. High capacity broadband is not needed for such applications; the most important requirements are low power and cost, reliable communication, and compact size. GreenPHY uses up to 75% less energy than AV.

The HomePlug Powerline Alliance worked with utilities and meter manufacturers to develop this 690-page specification. HomePlug Green PHY devices are required to be fully interoperable with devices based on HomePlug AV, HomePlug AV2 and IEEE 1901 specification, which is considered to hamper their power consumption and cost reduction. The HomePlug silicon vendor QualComm announced commercially available Green PHY silicon in December 2011.

HomePlug GreenPHY is the communication protocol used in the international electric vehicle charging standard CCS

===HomePlug Access BPL===
Access Broadband Power Line (BPL) refers to a to-the-home broadband access technology. The HomePlug Alliance formed the HomePlug Access BPL Working Group, whose first charter was to develop the Market Requirements Document (MRD) for a HomePlug Access BPL specification. The Alliance made an open invitation to the BPL industry to participate in the development of or provide input for consideration in the MRD. After several months of collaboration between utilities, ISPs and other BPL industry groups, the MRD was completed in June 2005. HomePlug&#x27;s work on the Access BPL was subsequently contributed and merged into the IEEE 1901 standard.

==Security==
Since signals may travel outside the user&#x27;s residence or business and be eavesdropped on, HomePlug includes the ability to set an encryption password. The HomePlug specification requires that all devices are set to a default out-of-box password although a common one. Users should change this password. If the password is not changed, an attacker can use their own homeplug device to detect the users signals, and then use the default password to access and change settings such as the encryption key used.

On many new powerline adapters that come as a boxed pair, a unique security key has already been established and the user does not need to change the password, except when using these with existing powerline adapters, or adding new adapters to an existing network. Some systems support an authenticate button, allowing adapters to be added to the network with just two button presses (one on each of the devices).

To simplify the process of configuring passwords on a HomePlug network, each device has a built-in master password, chosen at random by the manufacturer and hard-wired into the device, which is used only for setting the encryption passwords. A printed label on the device lists its master password.

The HomePlug AV standard uses 128-bit AES, while the older versions use the less secure DES protocols. This encryption has no effect on the data the user sends or receives, and therefore higher-level protocols and systems like TLS should still be used.

Since HomePlug devices typically function as transparent network bridges, computers running any operating system can use them for network access. However, some manufacturers only supply the password-setup software in a Microsoft Windows version; in other words, enabling encryption requires a computer running Windows . Once the encryption password has been configured, any device supporting the Ethernet specification will work on the adapter.

==Interoperability==
HomePlug AV, GP and AV2 are fully interoperable, and will also interoperate with IEEE 1901 devices. HomePlug 1.0 devices do not interoperate with HomePlug AV devices. Although it is technically possible to achieve such backward compatibility, doing so is not economically feasible because of the high cost of circuitry that would have to support different forward error correction (FEC) techniques and feature sets.

HomePlug devices will not interoperate with devices that employ other powerline technologies, such as Universal Powerline Association (UPA), HD-PLC, or G.hn. In the case of G.hn, it was deemed prohibitively expensive to implement both HomePlug&#x27;s turbo coding forward error correction and G.hn&#x27;s low-density parity-check code. However, IEEE 1901 allows co-existence within the same deployment of both HomePlug AV and HD-PLC via its Inter-System Protocol (ISP). G.hn also supports the ISP.

HomePlug devices are not compatible with certain power strips, surge protectors, and uninterruptible power supplies incorporating filters, which block the high-frequency signal. In such cases, the installer must plug devices directly into building electrical receptacles. If a spare power point is not available, a double adapter can be used in many cases with the incompatible device on one side and the HomePlug device on the other.

==EMI concerns==

In the UK there have been suggestions that users of powerline equipment should be prosecuted under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, if they cause interference to official radio systems. Also GCHQ has published concerns that such interference affects its ability to monitor radio activity in the UK.

<text>Arthur Annesley Ronald Firbank (17 January 1886 – 21 May 1926) was an innovative English novelist. His eight short novels, partly inspired by the London aesthetes of the 1890s, especially Oscar Wilde, consist largely of dialogue, with references to religion, social-climbing, and sexuality.

==Biography==
Arthur Annesley Ronald Firbank was born on 17 January 1886, in Clarges Street, Westminster, the son of a member of parliament, Sir Thomas Firbank, and Lady Firbank, née Harriet Jane Garrett. He had an older brother, Joseph Sydney (born 1884), a younger brother, Hubert Somerset (born 1887), and a sister, Heather (born 1888). At the age of fourteen Firbank went briefly to Uppingham School (September 1900 to April 1901) and then on to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1907. In 1909 he left Cambridge without taking a degree.

Living off his inheritance, he travelled around Spain, Italy, the Middle East, and North Africa. Openly gay and chronically shy, he was an enthusiastic consumer of alcohol and cannabis. He died of lung disease in Rome, aged 40, and is buried in the Campo Verano cemetery.

==Work==

Firbank published his first story, &quot;Odette d&#x27;Antrevernes&quot;, in 1905, before going up to Cambridge. He then produced a series of novels, from &quot;The Artificial Princess&quot; (written in 1915, published posthumously in 1934) and &quot;Vainglory&quot; (1915, his longest work) to &quot;Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli&quot; (1926, also posthumous).

&quot;Inclinations&quot; (1916) is set mainly in Greece, where the fifteen-year-old Mabel Collins is travelling with her chaperone, Miss O&#x27;Brookomore. Mabel elopes with an Italian conte, but the plot is of minor importance and the interest, as with all Firbank&#x27;s work, lies in the dialogue. His next novel &quot;Caprice&quot; followed in 1917.

&quot;Valmouth&quot; (1919) is based on the lives of various people in a health resort on the West Coast of England; most of the inhabitants are centenarians, and some are older (&quot;the last time I went to the play...was with Charles the Second and Louise de Querouaille, to see Betterton play Shylock&quot;). The inconsequential plot is concerned with the attempts of two elderly ladies, Mrs Hurstpierpoint and Mrs Thoroughfare, to marry off the heir to Hare-Hatch House, Captain Dick Thoroughfare. Captain Thoroughfare, who is engaged to a black woman, Niri-Esther, is loved frantically by Thetis Tooke, a farmer&#x27;s daughter, but prefers his &#x27;chum&#x27;, Jack Whorwood, to both of them. Meanwhile Mrs Yajñavalkya, a black masseuse, manages an alliance between the centenarian Lady Parvula de Panzoust and David Tooke, Thetis&#x27;s brother. A musical comedy of 1958 by Sandy Wilson gave the novel some popularity in the 1960s, and has been revived several times and recorded on CD.

This was followed by a story, &quot;Santal&quot; (1921), that describes an Arab boy&#x27;s search for God. In his next novel, &quot;The Flower Beneath The Foot&quot; (1923), the setting is an imaginary country somewhere in the Balkans. The characters include the King and Queen, sundry high-born ladies about the Court, and the usual attendant chorus of priests and nuns.

&quot;Sorrow in Sunlight&quot; (1924), renamed &quot;Prancing Nigger&quot; at the suggestion of the American publisher but first published in Britain under the author&#x27;s original title, was especially successful in America. It is set in a Caribbean republic (compounded of Cuba and Haiti). A socially ambitious black family move from their rural home to the capital, and the story is concerned with their attempts, which prove mainly abortive, to &#x27;get into society&#x27;.

&quot;Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli&quot; (1926) begins with Cardinal Pirelli christening a dog in his cathedral (&quot;And thus being cleansed and purified, I do call thee &#x27;Crack&#x27;!&quot;) and ends with his dying of a heart attack while chasing, naked, a choirboy around the aisles.

Firbank&#x27;s play &quot;The Princess Zoubaroff&quot; (1920) has been compared to William Congreve, but is rarely produced. Dame Edith Evans played the title part in a radio production in 1964. The dialogue is highly characteristic: for example, Princess Zoubaroff says: &quot;I am always disappointed with mountains. There are no mountains in the world as high as I would wish... They irritate me invariably. I should like to shake Switzerland.&quot;

Firbank&#x27;s &quot;Complete Short Stories&quot; were published in 1990 in a single volume edited by Steven Moore, and his &quot;Complete Plays&quot; in 1991, with &quot;The Princess Zoubaroff&quot;, &quot;The Mauve Tower&quot; and &quot;A Disciple from the Country&quot;.

Ronald Firbank left among his manuscripts the first few chapters of a novel set in New York, &quot;The New Rythum&quot; (sic). These were published in 1962 after a sale of many of his manuscripts and letters.

==Critical reception==
Playwright Joe Orton was an admirer of Firbank&#x27;s works, calling him &quot;the only impressionist in the English novel&quot; and &quot;the source.&quot; He added that although he enjoyed several of Firbank&#x27;s novels, he described his own writing as containing a greater vivid personal imagination when compared with Firbank&#x27;s.

His novels have been championed by many English novelists including E. M. Forster, Evelyn Waugh, Alan Hollinghurst and Simon Raven. The poet W. H. Auden praised him highly in a radio broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in June 1961 (the text of the broadcast was published in &quot;The Listener&quot; of 8 June 1961). Susan Sontag named his novels as part of &quot;the canon of camp&quot; in her 1964 essay &quot;Notes on &#x27;Camp&#x27;&quot;.

In her 1973 critical biography, &quot;Prancing Novelist&quot;, Brigid Brophy examines Firbank&#x27;s cult of Oscar Wilde.

Angela Carter created a radio play inspired by the life of Firbank called &quot;A Self-Made Man&quot; which was first broadcast on Radio 3 in 1984.

Steven Moore records Firbank&#x27;s critical reception up to 1995 in his &quot;Ronald Firbank: An Annotated Bibliography of Secondary Materials&quot; (Dalkey Archive Press, 1996).

In Alan Hollinghurst&#x27;s novel &quot;The Swimming Pool Library&quot; Firbank&#x27;s work and life are central themes.

<text>Prodrazverstka, also transliterated prodrazvyorstka (, short for , ), alternatively referred to in English as grain requisitioning, was a policy and campaign of confiscation of grain and other agricultural products from peasants at nominal fixed prices according to specified quotas (the noun &quot;razverstka,&quot; , and the verb &quot;razverstat&quot;, refer to the partition of the requested total amount as obligations from the suppliers).

The term is commonly associated with war communism during the Russian Civil War when it was introduced by the Bolshevik government. However, the Bolsheviks borrowed the idea from the grain &quot;razverstka&quot; introduced in the Russian Empire in 1916 during World War I.

==World War I grain razverstka==
1916 saw a food crisis in the Russian Empire. While the harvest was good in Lower Volga Region and Western Siberia, its transportation by railroads collapsed. Additionally, the food market was in disarray as fixed prices for government purchases were unattractive. A decree of November 29, 1916 signed by Aleksandr Rittich of the Ministry of Agriculture introduced razverstka as the collection of grain for defense purposes. The Russian Provisional Government established after the February Revolution of 1917 could not propose any incentives for peasants, and their state monopoly on grain sales failed to achieve its goal.

==Soviet prodrazverstka==
In 1918 the center of Soviet Russia found itself cut off from the most important agricultural regions of the country - at this stage of the Russian Civil War the White movement controlled many of the traditional food-producing areas. Reserves of grain ran low, causing hunger among the urban population, from which the Bolshevik government received its strongest support. In order to satisfy minimal food needs, the Soviet government introduced strict control over the food surpluses of prosperous rural households. Since many peasants were extremely unhappy with this policy and tried to resist it, they were branded as &quot;saboteurs&quot; of the bread monopoly of the state and advocates of free &quot;predatory&quot;, &quot;speculative&quot; trade. Vladimir Lenin believed that prodrazvyorstka was the only possible way - in the circumstances - to procure sufficient amounts of grain and other agricultural products for the population of the cities during the civil war.

Before prodrazverstka, Lenin&#x27;s May 9, 1918 decree (&quot;О продовольственной диктатуре&quot;) introduced the concept of &quot;produce dictatorship&quot;. This and other subsequent decrees ordered the forced collection of foodstuffs, without any limitations, and used the Red Army to accomplish this.

A decree of the Sovnarkom introduced prodrazvyorstka throughout Soviet Russia on January 11, 1919. The authorities extended the system to Ukraine and Belarus in 1919, and to Turkestan and Siberia in 1920. In accordance with the decree of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Provisions on the procedures of prodrazvyorstka (January 13, 1919), the number of different kinds of products designated for collection by the state was calculated on the basis of the data on each guberniia&#x27;s areas under crops, crop capacity and the reserves of past years. Within each guberniia, the collection plan was broken down between uezds, volosts, villages, and then separate peasant households. The collection procedures were performed by the agencies of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Provisions and prodotriads (singular: продовольственный отряд, food brigades) with the help of kombeds (комитет бедноты, committees of the poor) and of local Soviets.

Initially, prodrazverstka covered the collection of grain and fodder. During the procurement campaign of 1919–20, prodrazverstka also included potatoes and meat. By the end of 1920, it included almost every kind of agricultural product. According to Soviet statistics, the authorities collected 107.9 million poods (1.77 million metric tons) of grain and fodder in 1918–19, 212.5 million poods (3.48 million metric tons) in 1919–20, and 367 million poods (6.01 million metric tons) in 1920–21.

Prodrazverstka allowed the Soviet government to solve the important problem of supplying the Red Army and the urban population, and of providing raw materials for various industries. Prodrazverstka left its mark on commodity-money relations, since the authorities had prohibited selling of bread and grain. It also influenced relations between the city and the village and became one of the most important elements of the system of war communism.

As the Russian Civil War approached its end in the 1920s, prodrazverstka lost its actuality, but it had done much damage to the agricultural sector and had caused growing discontent among peasants. As the government switched to the NEP (New Economic Policy), a decree of the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in March 1921 replaced prodrazverstka with prodnalog (food tax).

<text>Patricia Anne Wettig (born December 4, 1951) is an American actress and playwright. She is best known for her role as Nancy Weston in the television series &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; (1987–1991), for which she received a Golden Globe Award and three Primetime Emmy Awards.

After her breakthrough role in &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, Wettig has appeared in a number of films, including &quot;Guilty by Suspicion&quot; (1991), &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991), &quot;City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Langoliers&quot; (1995). She returned to television playing a leading role in the 1995 short-lived drama &quot;Courthouse&quot; and later played Caroline Reynolds in the Fox drama &quot;Prison Break&quot; (2005–2007) and Holly Harper in the ABC family drama &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; (2006–2011).

==Early life==
Wettig was born in Milford, Ohio, to Florence (née Morlock) and Clifford Neal Wettig, a high school basketball coach. She has three sisters: Pam, Phyllis, and Peggy. She was raised in Grove City, Pennsylvania, and graduated in 1970. She attended Ohio Wesleyan University and graduated from Temple University in 1975. She returned to her studies later in life and received a Master of Fine Arts in playwriting from Smith College in 2001. &quot;F2M&quot;, a play she authored, was performed in 2011 as part of the New York Stage and Film and Vassar College&#x27;s 2011 Powerhouse Theater season.

== Career ==
Wettig began her career on stage and worked as a personal dresser for Shirley MacLaine. On television, she appeared in episodes of 1980s dramas &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, before taking a recurring role as Joanne McFadden in the NBC medical drama series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; from 1986 to 1987. Later in 1987, Wettig was cast as Nancy Weston in the ABC drama series &quot;thirtysomething&quot;.

For her role in &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, Wettig received critical acclaim. Her portrayal of Nancy&#x27;s cancer struggle attracted considerable acclaim and attention. She won three Primetime Emmy Awards: for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1988, and for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1990 and 1991. 
In 1991, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. The series ended in 1991 after four seasons. Later that year, she made her big screen debut in the drama film &quot;Guilty by Suspicion&quot; starring opposite Robert De Niro and Annette Bening. She played Billy Crystal&#x27;s wife in the comedy films &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991) and &quot;City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1994). In 1993, she had a leading role in the comedy-drama film &quot;Me and Veronica&quot; .

Later in 1995, she returned to television with a leading role of tough female judge in the CBS drama series &quot;Courthouse&quot;. Wettig intended to leave the show due to &quot;creative differences&quot;, with sources saying that she wanted the show to be more of a star vehicle for her, rather than an ensemble cast, but the show was cancelled before her character could be written out.

In 2002, Wettig was a regular cast member in the short-lived Bravo drama series &quot;Breaking News&quot;. From 2002 to 2004, she played the recurring role of CIA psychotherapist Dr. Judy Barnett on &quot;Alias&quot; (on which her husband was an executive producer and director). From 2005 to 2007, Wettig appeared in 18 episodes of Fox television drama, &quot;Prison Break&quot;, playing fictional Vice President Caroline Reynolds. She turned down Fox&#x27;s offer of becoming a series regular on &quot;Prison Break&quot; in order to pursue the ABC comedy-drama series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, which debuted in September 2006. Wettig starred in the series as the Walker family patriarch&#x27;s mistress, Holly Harper. She left the show midway through the show&#x27;s fifth and final season after her character executive &quot;Holly Harper&quot; followed her daughter to New York along with her fiancé David played by real life husband Ken Olin.

In 2012, Wettig joined the national tour for Larry Kramer&#x27;s production, &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;. In 2014, she starred in the unsold the CW drama pilot &quot;Identity&quot; opposite Ahna O&#x27;Reilly In 2019, she played a leading role in the episode of Netflix anthology series &quot;Heartstrings&quot;.

<doc id="1135929" wikidata="Q923539" url="?curid=1135929" title="Pood">
<text>Pood (, plural: or ) is a unit of mass equal to 40 &quot;funt&quot; (, Russian pound). Since 1899 it is set to approximately 16.38 kilograms (36.11 pounds). It was used in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. &quot;Pood&quot; was first mentioned in a number of 12th-century documents. Unlike &quot;funt&quot;, which came at least in the 14th century from , (formerly written * ) is a much older borrowing from Late Latin &quot;pondo&quot;, from Classical &quot;pondus&quot;.

== Use in the past and present ==

Together with other units of weight of the Imperial Russian weight measurement system, the USSR officially abolished the &quot;pood&quot; in 1924. The term remained in widespread use until at least the 1940s. In his 1953 short story &quot;Matryona&#x27;s Place&quot;, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn presents the &quot;pood&quot; as still in use amongst the Khrushchev-era Soviet peasants.

Its usage is preserved in modern Russian in certain specific cases, e.g., in reference to sports weights, such as traditional Russian kettlebells, cast in multiples and fractions of 16 kg (which is &quot;pood&quot; rounded to metric units). For example, a 24 kg kettlebell is commonly referred to as &quot;one-and-half &quot;pood&quot; kettlebell&quot; (). It is also sometimes used when reporting the amounts of bulk agricultural production, such as grains or potatoes.

An old Russian proverb reads, &quot;You know a man when you have eaten a &quot;pood&quot; of salt with him.&quot; ()

== Idioms in Slavic languages ==
In modern colloquial Russian, the expression () – &#x27;a hundred &quot;poods&quot;,&#x27; an intentional play on the foreign &quot;hundred percent&quot; – imparts the ponderative sense of overwhelming weight to the declarative sentence it is added to. The generic meaning of &quot;very serious&quot; or &quot;absolutely sure&quot; has almost supplanted its original meaning of &quot;very heavy weight.&quot; The adjective and the adverb are also used to convey the same sense of certainty.

The word is also used in Polish idiomatically or as a proverb (with the original/strict meaning commonly forgotten): (Polish for &#x27;unsupportable boredoms&#x27;, literally &#x27;boredoms [that could be measured] in &quot;poods&quot;&#x27;)

<text>Hull County, formerly known as Wright County, is an historic county of Quebec, Canada. It was named after the town of the same name (Hull or Kingston-upon-Hull) in East Yorkshire, England. It is located on the north shore of the Ottawa River and is part of the Outaouais, one of roughly 12 historical regions of Québec.

The county is roughly rectangular, bound in the north by the Township of Portland in Papineau County (45 degrees N 41&#x27;, 12 km), entirely in the east by the Township of Buckingham in Papineau County (75 degrees W 33&#x27;, 22 km), on its northwestern corner by the Township of Wakefield in Gatineau, and on its west by the Township of Hull in Gatineau County. Across the entire length of its Ottawa River border is the Township of Gloucester in Carleton County, both part of Ottawa, in Ontario. The entire county is the same as the former Township of Templeton. The township-county comprised several communities, namely Templeton, Gatineau, and Pointe-Gatineau which have now been merged. In terms of topography, about two-thirds of the county in the north contain landscapes typical of the Canadian Shield, while the lower third is gentler valley terrain.

The historic Towns of Gatineau and Pointe-Gatineau were often thought of as being in neighbouring Gatineau County however they were in Hull County. Likewise the former township of Hull (although the city itself was in Hull County) was to the west in Gatineau County. The County seat of Hull County was located in Hull. In the early 1990s, following the abolishment of Quebec&#x27;s counties ten years earlier, a Regional County Municipality system was installed and northern Hull County became Les Collines-de-l&#x27;Outaouais Regional County Municipality and the southern half was transferred into the Outaouais Urban Community (now the City of Gatineau).

Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King died here on July 22, 1950.

== Name ==
Wright County took the name of Ottawa County on 3 April 1912. On 17 March 1919, it was renamed Hull County. 

== Note ==

The Townships are primarily a surveying unit introduced after the British conquest, and were designated to cover most of the unattributed territory in Quebec. They were given out (concessions) to &quot;Leaders&quot; who had the responsibility of finding &quot;Associates&quot; and to develop their Township. The usual size was about X - it varied slightly during surveying periods.

The surveyors divided Townships into lines, and that in turn they divided into lots. A lot was generally .

<doc id="1135955" wikidata="Q1548312" url="?curid=1135955" title="Bermuda rig">
<text>Bermuda rig, Bermudian rig, or Marconi rig is a type of sailing rig that uses a triangular sail set abaft (behind) the mast. It is the typical configuration for most modern sailboats. Whilst commonly seen in sloop-rigged vessels, Bermuda rig is used in a range of configurations, for instance, a cutter or a schooner (where it may be used in conjunction with gaff rigged sails on other masts), and several other types.

Bermuda rig takes its name from Bermuda, where it was developed in the 17th century. The term &quot;Marconi&quot;, a reference to the inventor of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi, became associated with this configuration in the early 20th century, because the wires that stabilize the mast of a Bermuda rig reminded observers of the wires on early radio masts.

==Description==

The rig consists of a triangular sail set abaft (behind) the mast with its head raised to the top of the mast; its luff runs down the mast and is normally attached to it for its entire length; its tack is usually attached to the gooseneck; its foot (in modern versions of the rig) controlled by a boom; and its clew attached to the after end of the boom, which is controlled by its sheet.

Originally developed for smaller Bermudian vessels, and ultimately adapted to the larger, ocean-going Bermuda sloop, in which the Bermuda sail is set as the mainsail on the main mast. The Bermuda rigging has largely replaced the older gaff rigged fore-and-aft sails, except notably on schooners. The traditional design as developed in Bermuda features very tall, raked masts, a long bowsprit, and may or may not have a boom. In some configurations such as the Bermuda Fitted Dinghy vast areas of sail are achieved with this rig. Elsewhere, however, the design has omitted the bowsprit, and has otherwise become less extreme.

A Bermuda rigged sloop with a single jib is known as a &quot;Bermuda sloop&quot;, a &quot;Marconi sloop&quot;, or a &quot;Marconi rig&quot;. A Bermuda sloop may also be a more specific type of vessel such as a small sailing ships traditional in Bermuda which may or may not be Bermuda &quot;rigged&quot;.

The foot of a Bermuda sail may be attached to the boom along its length, or in some modern rigs the sail is attached to the boom only at its ends. This modern variation of a Bermuda mainsail is known as a &quot;loose-footed main&quot;. In some early Bermudian vessels, the mainsails were attached only to the mast and deck, lacking booms. This is the case on two of the three masts of the newly built &quot;Spirit of Bermuda&quot;, a replica of an 1830s British Royal Navy sloop-of-war. Additional sails were also often mounted on traditional Bermudian craft, when running down wind, which included a spinnaker, with a spinnaker boom, and additional jibs.

The main controls on a Bermuda sail are: 
* The cunningham tightens the luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling downward on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack.
*The halyard used to raise the head, and sometimes to tension the luff.
*The outhaul used to tension the foot by hauling the clew towards the end of the boom.
*The sheet used to haul the boom down and towards the center of the boat.
*The vang or &quot;kicking strap&quot; which runs between a point partway along the boom and the base of the mast, and is used to provide a downward force on the boom, which helps to prevent excessive twist in the leach, particularly when reaching or running.

==History==
The development of the rig is thought to have begun with fore-and-aft rigged boats built by a Dutch-born Bermudian in the 17th century. The Dutch were influenced by Moorish lateen rigs introduced during Spain&#x27;s rule of their country. The Dutch eventually modified the design by omitting the masts, with the yard arms of the lateens being &quot;stepped in thwarts&quot;. By this process, the yards became raked masts. Lateen sails mounted this way were known as &quot;leg-of-mutton&quot; sails in English. The Dutch called a vessel rigged in this manner a (). A is visible in a painting of King Charles II arriving in Rotterdam in 1660. After sailing on such a vessel, Charles was so impressed that his eventual successor, the Prince of Orange presented him with a copy of his own, which Charles named . The rig had been introduced to Bermuda some decades before this. Captain John Smith reported that Captain Nathaniel Butler, who was the governor of Bermuda from 1619 to 1622, employed the Dutch boat builder, Jacob Jacobsen, one of the crew of a Dutch frigate which had been wrecked on Bermuda, who quickly established a leading position among Bermuda&#x27;s boat makers, reportedly building and selling more than a hundred boats within the space of three years (to the resentment of many of his competitors, who were forced to emulate his designs). A poem published by John H. Hardie in 1671 described Bermuda&#x27;s boats such: &quot;With tripple corner&#x27;d Sayls they always float, About the Islands, in the world there are, None in all points that may with them compare.&quot;

Ships with somewhat similar rigs were in fact recorded in Holland during the 1600s. These early Bermuda rigged boats evidently lacked jibs or booms, and the masts appear not to have been as robust as they were to become (a boat rigged with a Bermuda or gaff mainsail and no jib would today be known as a catboat). In 1675, Samuel Fortrey, of Kew, wrote to the naval administrator and Member of Parliament, Samuel Pepys, a treatise entitled &quot;Of Navarchi&quot;, suggesting the improvement of the &quot;Bermoodn&quot; rig with the addition of a boom, but evidently nothing came of this. Bermudian builders did introduce these innovations themselves, though when they first appeared has been lost to record.

By the 1800s, the design of Bermudian vessels had largely dispensed with square topsails and gaff rig, replacing them with triangular main sails and jibs. The Bermuda rig had traditionally been used on vessels with two or more masts, with the gaff rig favoured for single-masted vessels. The reason for this was the increased height necessary for a single mast, which led to too much canvas. The solid wooden masts at that height were also too heavy, and not sufficiently strong. This changed when the boats began to be raced in the early 1800s. H. G. Hunt, a naval officer (and possibly the Henry G. Hunt who was the Acting Governor of Bermuda in 1835) concluded in the 1820s that a single-masted sloop would be superior to the schooner he had been racing and was proved correct when the yacht he had commissioned won a secret race against a schooner the night before a public race, and the public race itself the following day. Single-masted sloops quickly became the norm in Bermudian racing, with the introduction of hollow masts and other refinements.

The colony&#x27;s lightweight Bermuda cedar vessels were widely prized for their agility and speed, especially upwind. The high, raked masts and long bowsprits and booms favoured in Bermuda allowed its vessels of all sizes to carry vast areas of sail when running down-wind with spinnakers and multiple jibs, allowing great speeds to be reached. Bermudian work boats, mostly small sloops, were ubiquitous on the archipelago&#x27;s waters in the 1800s, moving freight, people, and everything else about. The rig was eventually adopted almost universally on small sailing craft in the 1900s, although as seen on most modern vessels it is very much less extreme than on traditional Bermudian designs, with lower, vertical masts, shorter booms, omitted bowsprits, and much less area of canvas.

The term &quot;Marconi rig&quot; was first applied to the tall Bermuda rig used on larger racing yachts, such as the J class used since 1914 for the America&#x27;s Cup international yacht races, as - with the many supporting cables required - it reminded observers of Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s mast-like wireless antennas (Marconi&#x27;s first demonstrations in the United States took place in the autumn of 1899, with the reporting of the America&#x27;s Cup at New York). Although sometimes treated as interchangeable with &quot;Bermuda rig&quot; generally, some purists insist that &quot;Marconi rig&quot; refers only to the very tall Bermuda rig used on yachts like the J-class.

<text>SS &quot;Empire Shelter was a [[convoy rescue ship]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]], originally [[laid down]] as theHMS &quot;Barnard Castle (pennant number K594). Completed a month before the end of the war in May 1945, she made a few short voyages before she was reduced to reserve. The ship later served as a barracks ship and then as a troopship before she was sold for scrap in 1955.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The convoy rescue conversions had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a tonnage of . The ships were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The convoy rescue ships were given an armament of a single 12-pounder () anti-aircraft (AA) guns and five Oerlikon AA guns on single mounts.

==Construction and career==
The ship was ordered from George Brown &amp; Co. of Greenock on 9 December 1942 as a Castle-class corvette. She was laid down in 1943 and launched on 5 October 1944 as &quot;Barnard Castle&quot; (K594), but further work was then cancelled, and she was completed as a convoy rescue ship on 17 April 1945. Under the ownership of the Ministry of War Transport, and managed by the Ellerman City Line, she sailed on six convoys over the next month, but made no rescues. On 22 May 1945 the ship was briefly placed in reserve before she became an accommodation ship for the Third Submarine Flotilla based in Holy Loch. &quot;Empire Shelter&quot; later served as a troopship. By 1955 she had been laid up in the River Fal and was sold for scrap that year. The ship arrived at Burght, Belgium, on 29 July to begin demolition.

<text>USS &quot;Chub&quot; (SS-329), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the chub, a game fish of the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The name is also given locally to a wide variety of American fishes. She was later transferred to Turkey where she served as TCG &quot;Gür&quot; (S 334).

==Operational history==

===USS &quot;Chub&quot;===
SS-329, originally named &quot;Bonaci&quot;, was renamed &quot;Chub&quot; on 24 September 1942 and launched 18 June 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. T. A. Risch; and commissioned 21 October 1944.

==== First war patrol, February – April 1945 ====

&quot;Chub&quot; reached Pearl Harbor from New London 24 January 1945, and after final training, put to sea for action waters 13 February. Her first war patrol, in Tonkin Gulf and the Java and South China Seas, found her skill and determination tried in four hairbreadth escapes from destruction.

On 3 March, she was attacked by an enemy submarine whose torpedoes she evaded. On 29 March, she began a long surface chase after an escort group, which she carried through the next day, even though forced six times to go deep by enemy aircraft. On their last pass, they dropped bombs, a clear indication that &quot;Chub&quot;&#x27;s chase must be broken off.

The next day she was off Yulikan Bay, and while American and Japanese planes fought in the skies above, &quot;Chub&quot; rescued three downed pilots as they and she were strafed. With two Japanese patrol craft looming out of the harbor, &quot;Chub&quot; raced away. On 12 April, &quot;Chub&quot; was bombed by an enemy patrol plane as the submarine dove. Bomb damage caused a temporary loss of power, and with depth control lost, &quot;Chub&quot; broached. Fortunately, the aircraft had apparently dropped its entire load on the first run.

==== Second and third war patrols, May – August 1945 ====

&quot;Chub&quot; put into Fremantle, Australia to repair and refit from 18 April 1945 to 14 May, and then sailed for the Java Sea and her second war patrol. During this patrol, she attacked two freighters, and sank the minesweeper &quot;W-34&quot; which had come out hunting for her. The damage already done to Japanese shipping made targets few by this time, and &quot;Chub&quot; put into Subic Bay from 21 June to 15 July to refit.

Her third war patrol found her again in the Java Sea, sinking a number of small craft, although again and again attacked by the remnant of Japanese air strength. Returning to Fremantle 17 August, she sailed on to Subic Bay for training through the remainder of 1945, then returned to the West Coast.

==== 1946 – 1947 ====

During 1946, &quot;Chub&quot; operated from Pearl Harbor, her new home port, visiting the west coast for necessary overhaul. Between 12 November 1946 and 14 February 1947, she served in the Far East, making a simulated war patrol, and training with the 7th Fleet. During late 1947, she joined in a training cruise in Alaskan waters, and voyaged from Seattle to San Francisco with reservists on board for training.

After overhaul at San Francisco she put to sea 4 March 1948 to call at New London, then crossed the Atlantic and Mediterranean to İzmir, Turkey, arriving 11 May. She was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register 23 May 1948.

==== Honors and awards ====
&quot;Chub&quot; received three battle stars for World War II service by reason of her three &quot;successful&quot; war patrols. She is credited with having sunk a total of 4,200 tons of shipping.

=== TCG &quot;Gür&quot;===
The ex-&quot;Chub&quot; was transferred to Turkey on 25 May 1948, and was commissioned in the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Gür&quot; (S 334). In 1953, she was converted to a GUPPY Fleet Snorkel Submarine, the work being done first in Turkey&#x27;s Gölcük Navy Yard and completed in the United States.

&quot;Gür&quot; was decommissioned on 12 December 1975, returned to U.S. custody, and sold for scrapping.

<doc id="1135969" wikidata="Q2612004" url="?curid=1135969" title="The Mangler">
<text>&quot;The Mangler&quot; is a short story by Stephen King, first published in the December 1972 issue of &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazine, and later collected in King&#x27;s 1978 collection &quot;Night Shift&quot;.

==Setting==
&quot;The Mangler&quot; is set in an American town, and the action largely takes place in an industrial laundry. Stephen King has stated that, among the many jobs he took to support his family before he became famous, he worked in an industrial laundry.

==Plot summary==
Police detective John Hunton investigates a fatal accident at the Blue Ribbon Laundry in which worker Adelle Frawley was killed. Frawley was somehow pulled into the laundry&#x27;s speed ironing and folding machine, which the workers colloquially refer to as &quot;the mangler.&quot; Hunton is disturbed by the sight of Frawley&#x27;s grisly remains and expects that the laundry&#x27;s owners will be jailed for negligence in Frawley&#x27;s death, but he is surprised when a formal inquest absolves the laundry of any wrongdoing. Roger Martin, an inspector involved with the inquest, informs Hunton that a thorough inspection of the mangler revealed no problems with it, and that the machine is equipped with safety measures designed specifically to prevent exactly what happened to Frawley; the accident that killed her should have been impossible.

Over the days that follow, more accidents occur at the Blue Ribbon. A steam line feeding the mangler ruptures, burning several laundry workers, and foreman George Stanner is later maimed when the machine nearly pulls him in just as it did Frawley, forcing a maintenance man to sever Stanner&#x27;s arm with a fire axe in order to save his life. Witnesses report that the mangler could not be shut off, even after its fuses had been pulled, and that the strange incidents involving the speed ironer began about a week before Frawley&#x27;s death, when young worker Sherry Ouelette accidentally cut her finger and spilled her blood on the machine. Hunton interviews Ouelette and learns that she is a virgin.

Hunton&#x27;s friend Mark Jackson, an English professor with an interest in occult literature, hypothesizes that through a confluence of unrelated events, the mangler has incidentally consumed several ingredients (the blood of a virgin, from Ouelette; bat&#x27;s blood, from a bat nesting in the decrepit laundry; and horse&#x27;s hoof from a container of Jell-O in a bag lunch) that are commonly used in occult rituals, inadvertently summoning a demon that has now possessed the mangler. To remove it, Hunton and Jackson prepare to exorcise the machine. They are concerned that the ingredients used in the summoning might include belladonna (referred to in Jackson&#x27;s archaic texts as &quot;the hand of glory&quot;), which would call a significantly stronger demon, but they discount this possibility as the plant is not indigenous to the area. The two men travel to the Blue Ribbon to conduct the exorcism.

Unbeknownst to Hunton and Jackson, the mangler &quot;has&quot; consumed belladonna, as it was an active ingredient in antacid tablets that Frawley accidentally dropped into the mangler shortly before her death. As a result, their attempt to exorcise the machine fails, and instead of weakening the demon, the botched ritual only serves to strengthen it. The mangler begins to rip itself loose from the concrete floor of the laundry, &quot;like a dinosaur trying to escape a tar pit,&quot; and kills Jackson.

Hunton flees to the home of Roger Martin and implores him to destroy the mangler before collapsing in a faint. Martin picks up the telephone, but before he can call anyone, he realizes from the increasingly loud metallic sounds outside and the scent of blood in the air that the mangler has already broken free of its moorings and is now roaming the streets in search of prey.

== Adaptations ==
This story was adapted for the screenplay of a 1995 film (directed by Tobe Hooper) of the same title, though the brevity of the source material required significant additions not present in the original tale. The film, starring Robert Englund (of Freddy Krueger fame), was followed by two sequels, &quot;The Mangler 2&quot; and &quot;The Mangler Reborn&quot;. Both are alternating sequels to the first film.

<text>The Epte () is a river in Seine-Maritime and Eure, in Normandy, France. It is a right tributary of the Seine, long. The river rises in Seine-Maritime in the Pays de Bray, near Forges-les-Eaux, and empties into the Seine not far from Giverny. One of its tributaries is the Aubette de Magny. In 911 the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte established the river as the historical boundary of Normandy and Île-de-France.

Claude Monet lived at Giverny near the river for more than forty years. In his garden, by diverting a branch of the Epte, he established a water garden with a water-lily pond and Japanese-style bridge. The river appears in a number of his works, including &quot;Peupliers au bord de l&#x27;Epte&quot;.

<doc id="1135973" wikidata="Q1124041" url="?curid=1135973" title="Suzuki Hayabusa">
<text>The Suzuki GSX1300R Hayabusa is a sports motorcycle made by Suzuki since 1999. It immediately won acclaim as the world&#x27;s fastest production motorcycle, with a top speed of .

In 1999, fears of a European regulatory backlash or import ban led to an informal agreement between the Japanese and European manufacturers to govern the top speed of their motorcycles at an arbitrary limit starting in late 2000. The media-reported value for the speed agreement in miles per hour was consistently 186 mph, while in kilometers per hour it varied from 299 to 303 km/h, which is typical given unit conversion rounding errors. This figure may also be affected by a number of external factors, as can the power and torque values.

The conditions under which this limitation was adopted led to the 1999 and 2000 Hayabusa&#x27;s title remaining, at least technically, immune, since no subsequent model could go faster without being tampered with like early 2000 models.
After the much anticipated Kawasaki Ninja ZX-12R of 2000 fell short of claiming the title, the Hayabusa secured its place as the fastest standard production bike of the 20th century. This gives the unrestricted 1999 models even more cachet with collectors.

Besides its speed, the Hayabusa has been lauded by many reviewers for its all-round performance, in that it does not drastically compromise other qualities like handling, comfort, reliability, noise, fuel economy or price in pursuit of a single function. Jay Koblenz of &quot;Motorcycle Consumer News&quot; commented, &quot;If you think the ability of a motorcycle to approach 190 mph or reach the quarter-mile in under 10 seconds is at best frivolous and at worst offensive, this still remains a motorcycle worthy of just consideration. The Hayabusa is Speed in all its glory. But Speed is not all the Hayabusa is.&quot;

==First generation (1999–2007)==
When first shown to the press in 1999, the first Hayabusas made a profound impression. No previous motorcycle has broken the production model top speed record by such a margin, , depending on which measured speeds the source was relying on for the CBR1100XX and the GSX-1300R.

 is Japanese for &quot;peregrine falcon&quot;, a bird that often serves as a metaphor for speed due to its vertical hunting dive, or &quot;stoop&quot;, speed of , the fastest of any bird. In particular, the choice of name was made because the peregrine falcon preys on blackbirds, which reflected the intent of the original Hayabusa to unseat the Honda CBR1100XX Super Blackbird as the world&#x27;s fastest production motorcycle. Eventually, the Hayabusa managed to surpass the Super Blackbird by at least a full .

The first generation had a liquid-cooled, inline-4 engine with sixteen valves driven by dual-overhead camshafts. This configuration, technologically unremarkable for that time, delivered a record-setting claimed at the crankshaft by virtue of the largest displacement ever in a sport bike, and a ram air system that forced cool, pressurized air into the cylinders at speed. Combined with sophisticated aerodynamics, this powerful engine pushed the Hayabusa&#x27;s top speed above the Honda CBR1100XX Blackbird by a significant leap, contrasting with the incremental gains that preceded the Suzuki hyper sport entry. The 1997 carbureted CBR1100XX had previously only inched past the previous top speed record holder, the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-11 of 1990.

The Hayabusa&#x27;s abundance of power at any engine speed made the Hayabusa easier to ride by giving the rider a greater choice of gear selection for a given speed and stunning acceleration.

The ram air ducts at the front of the drooping, rounded nose squeezed the frontal area away from the headlight, and this, along with the need for a narrow frontal area, necessitated a stacked headlight and high beam behind a single lens. Moreover, the need to reduce the extreme drag encountered at high speeds determined the Hayabusa&#x27;s entire bulbous, and much-criticized, bodywork design. Koblenz remarked, &quot;non-traditional styling generates the main controversy of the Hayabusa.&quot; When viewed through the eyes of those who judged its beauty on the basis of its functionality, or given a little time to get used to it, the bike&#x27;s looks did find admirers. The striking two-tone brown/silver paint scheme was similarly loved by some and hated by others but was successful if the intent of an all-new, flagship product is to make a bold statement. So while it was called ugly by some in the press, this aerodynamic shape was key to the Hayabusa&#x27;s ability to reach record-setting speeds.

Reflecting in 2009 on the initial design, the creator of the Hayabusa&#x27;s look, Suzuki&#x27;s Koji Yoshirua, said that the intent in 1999 was, &quot;to create a somewhat grotesque design and create a strong initial impact... The mission was to create a total new styling that will not be out of date within few years, and a styling that will be the &#x27;Face&#x27; of Suzuki.&quot; Yoshirua also said that the goal was not to achieve the status of the fastest production motorcycle, which in early stages was slated to be only , but that, &quot;as a consequence of, pursuing the best handling, acceleration, safety, power, riding ability, original styling, etc., for the good of the customers, it became the &#x27;Fastest production motorcycle&#x27; … By doing this, once the model was out in the market and the performance of it been proven, I thought that people will start to show interest to the weird design, and then the design would be caked in peoples mind.&quot;

The engine used a gear-driven counterbalancer to reduce vibration to the point that the engine could be solidly mounted to the frame, for the purpose of increasing chassis rigidity. Employing a conventional twin beam frame, fully adjustable upside down forks, using specially developed Bridgestone tires, and being relatively light at dry, the Hayabusa&#x27;s handling was considered excellent for a machine of this class. One reviewer, Koblenz, noted a hesitation perhaps related to poor low-rpm mapping at low speeds, noticeable as a &quot;pause and slight lurch&quot; when rolling on and back off the throttle.

===Top speed limited by agreement===

With rumors and then pre-release announcements of much greater power in Kawasaki&#x27;s Ninja ZX-12R in 2000, clearly attempting to unseat Suzuki and regain lucrative bragging rights, the speed war appeared to be escalating. There were growing fears of carnage and mayhem from motorcycles getting outrageously faster every year, and there was talk of regulating hyper sport motorcycles, or banning their import to Europe.

The response was a so-called gentlemen&#x27;s agreement between the Japanese and European manufacturers to electronically limit the speed of their motorcycles to 300 km/h (186 mph). The informal agreement went fully into effect for the 2001 model year. So for 2001 models, and those since, the question of which bike was fastest could only be answered by tampering with the speed limiting system, meaning that it was no longer a contest between stock, production motorcycles, absolving the manufacturer of blame and letting those not quite as fast avoid losing face. Both Kawasaki and Suzuki would claim, at least technically, to have the world&#x27;s fastest production motorcycle.

===Other developments===
After the inclusion of the speed limiting system in 2001, the Hayabusa remained substantially the same through the 2007 model year. An exception was a response to the problem of the aluminum rear subframe on 1999 and 2000 models breaking when the bike may have been overloaded with a passenger and luggage, and/or stressed by an aftermarket exhaust modification, so 2001 and later Hayabusas had a steel instead of aluminum rear subframe, adding to the 1999 and 2000 models&#x27; approximately wet weight.

===Performance and measurements===

==Second generation (2008–2020)==
Suzuki lightly revised the GSX1300R for the 2008 model year, with a minor restyling of the bodywork, and fine-tuning of the engine&#x27;s head, pistons and exhaust. Though the engine changes were relatively limited, they still yielded a large horsepower increase, and brought the bike into compliance with new noise and emissions requirements.

===Planning===
In 2004, market researchers from the US and Japan began working to identify which elements of the Hayabusa design had attracted so many buyers, discovering that, in spite of having its looks sometimes disparaged in print, customers were much enamored with the old Hayabusa. A redesign meant to strengthen the bike&#x27;s appearance without departing much from the original found approval with dealers and focus groups. Underneath the skin, Suzuki decided to save considerable development cost by keeping major portions of the frame and engine unchanged. This was because engineers had determined greater power was possible without a significant redesign of the old engine, even faced with the need to comply with more stringent noise and air pollution rules. The target was to produce more than at the crankshaft, and they delivered , an 11 or 12 percent increase over the previous output. When the new Hayabusa was released, independent tests bore this out, with @ 10,100 rpm measured at the rear wheel.

Suzuki&#x27;s Koji Yoshiura designed the look of the new Hayabusa. He had previously styled the first generation Hayabusa, as well as the Suzuki Bandit 400, RF600R, TL1000S and the SV650. For research, Yoshiura traveled around the United States to bike nights and clubs for a first-hand look at the styling aesthetic of the Hayabusa custom scene and was inspired as much by the look and build of the Hayabusa rider as their custom bikes. While the second generation is very close to the first in overall shape and is largely dictated by wind tunnel tests, the raised lines and curves are meant to suggest a muscular build. Said Yoshiura, &quot;I wanted to create a masculine form that complements a rider&#x27;s muscular structure with hints of developed bicep, forearm, and calves.&quot;

===Technical revisions===
Engine changes consisted of an increase in stroke by 2 mm, enlarging displacement to . The compression ratio was boosted from 11:1 to 12.5:1 and the cylinder head was made more compact and was given lighter titanium valves, saving and on each intake and exhaust valve, respectively. The valves were driven by a chain with a new hydraulic tensioner. The pistons were made lighter by and used ion-coated rings and shot peened connecting rods. The crankcase breather system had reed valves added to control pressure waves in the intake airbox, a way of avoiding power loss.

Fuel injectors from the GSX-R1000 were used, with smaller throttle bodies, called the Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) system. It has three selectable options of power delivery for a range of touring to wide open high performance. The exhaust system was overhauled, using a 4-2-1-2 system, meaning four exhaust outlets merging into two pipes, and then joining into a single pipe before splitting into two enlarged, quieter mufflers, which added a few pounds of weight compared to the first generation Hayabusa. The exhaust also included a catalytic converter and an oxygen sensor in order to meet Euro 3 emissions requirements.

The suspension was upgraded with a 43 mm Kayaba inverted fork with sliders having a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The rear shock is also a Kayaba, and the overall suspension is firmer than the previous model. The swingarm is similar in design to the old one but was strengthened. The front and rear remain fully adjustable. The transmission was given a heavier-duty, slipper clutch. The final drive ratio was slightly lower, and gears 5-6 were spaced farther apart, and gear ratios 1-2 moved closer together.

Ergonomic and cosmetic changes for the 2008 model include a higher windscreen, and interlocking gauge faces with a digital speedometer, as well as a new gear indicator and adjustable shift light. The fairing fasteners were hidden to uncomplicate custom paint work. The twin-spar aluminum frame was carried over from the previous version, and wheelbase, rake/trail, and seat height were the same, while overall length grew by two inches, and the taller windscreen added about ½ inch. Weight was saved by omitting the centerstand.

Technical improvements in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower unsprung weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The rear brake caliper was moved to the top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17 inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.

Other changes were a steering damper with a reservoir and dual cooling fans with a larger, curved radiator. Because of increased vibration from the longer stroke, the fuel tank was put on floating mounts. All told, the changes for 2008 resulted in a dry weight of , heavier than the prior generation.

===Other developments===
Suzuki has dropped the GSX1300R designation in some countries and simply called the motorcycle the Hayabusa.

In October 2009, the company celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Hayabusa in Santa Pod raceway where more than 500 owners of Hayabusas converged. Many events were organized and prizes were distributed to people who visited the event.

There were no changes through the 2011 model year except for new colors.

Alongside the second generation Hayabusa, Suzuki developed the new B-King, a naked bike in the streetfighter mold, using the same engine but with a different intake and exhaust.

===Performance and measurements===


==Third generation (2022)==
The third-generation Hayabusa was announced on February 5, 2021. &quot;Cycle World&quot; and &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; magazines referred to the third generation 2022 model year Hayabusa as GSX1300RR rather than GSX1300R, with no mention of what that might signify.

==Sales==
Typically, a new sportbike model sells well in its first year, and then sees its numbers decline every year as it grows older. The Hayabusa reversed this pattern, selling in greater numbers every year from the 1999 launch through the 2008 revision. From its debut in 1999 to June 2007 over 100,000 Hayabusas were sold worldwide. In the United States in each of the years 2005 and 2006, over 10,000 units were sold.

It was predicted that the gentlemen&#x27;s agreement speed cap would hurt sales, because buyers would not want a bike that was hobbled with a speed limiter, even riders who would never approach the hypothetical maximum. However, sales in the United States increased year after year between its release in 1999 and 2006, rising from just a few thousand units in 1999 to over 10,000 in 2006.

==Competitive motorsports==

Many riders have found that the Hayabusa lends itself well to any number of functional purposes, including competitive motorsports.

The Hayabusa has been used in sanctioned closed course road racing, drag racing, and top speed competition.

Top speeds of over 270 mph, engine outputs of over 700 horsepower, and performances in the standing quarter mile as quick as 6.9 seconds and as fast as 209.14

On July 17, 2011, riding a highly modified turbocharged Suzuki Hayabusa, Bill Warner set a new world motorcycle land speed record of from a standing start to 1.5 miles at the Loring Timing Association&#x27;s Land Speed Race, held at the Loring Commerce Centre (the former Loring Air Force Base) in Limestone, Maine.

==Custom versions==
The Hayabusa has been one of the top choices for streetbike customization, perhaps even the most popular customized sportbike. One reason may be the unique, instantly recognizable bodywork. The easy tunability of the engine, the wide selection of aftermarket parts, possibly more than any other Japanese motorcycle, and the interchangeability between models of Suzuki parts have also played a role. It was the vibrancy of this custom scene that prompted Suzuki to send Koji Yoshirua to the US for feedback and inspiration for the second generation design.

Bikes are typically built to impress with being the most extreme, and most innovative. For professional custom shops, the status as the first builder to introduce a new style or customization — a 300 mm-series rear tire width, for example — is often hotly contested, and can pay dividends in media attention and in sales. Celebrity customers, such as rappers or NBA stars, also serve to build the credibility of a custom shop. The bikes themselves, at shows, racetracks, dragstrips, and at build competitions, also serve as &quot;rolling billboards&quot; for their makers.

Bikes are usually built around a theme, such as a NASCAR-inspired bike with retro-70s chrome wheels, racing numbers, flames, and sponsor insignia reminiscent of a stock car, or a bike that takes its cues from popular films, such as Freddy Krueger of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. Other common motifs in custom artwork are sexy women, skulls, bones and other gruesome figures, and money and bling, such as &quot;Ben Franklins,&quot; $100 bills.

===Power enhancement===

Horsepower enhancements like nitrous injection, which can add , and turbocharging, which can raise power to more than , are common.


==Police use==
In 2006 the Oklahoma Highway Patrol (OHP) converted a seized Hayabusa into a pursuit vehicle, setting up the bike with equipment including a radar unit, police lights, and siren, and painting it in official colors and insignia. Impressed with the positive response from the public and the motorcycling community, the OHP purchased two more Hayabusas, to supplement their main fleet of Harley-Davidson police motorcycles. While they are used for patrol, the primary function of the Hayabusas is public relations and community outreach, due to the kind of attention the exotic bikes attract. According to the OHP, &quot;There are clear lines dividing sportbike and cruiser motorcycle riders. We feel the sportbike community has not been given the proper amount of attention and focus in the area of community involvement and rider safety education.&quot;

In 2009, Humberside Police in the United Kingdom put an undercover Hayabusa on the road, equipped with speed detection equipment and a video camera, as part of &quot;Operation Achilles&quot;, which aimed to catch speeding motorists and motorcyclists.

In the town of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Police operates a &quot;superbike unit&quot; composed entirely of seized Hayabusas that have been outfitted with lights, sirens, police livery and radar equipment for speed enforcement duty in the northern region of Puerto Rico.

In late 2021, the Arecibo municipal government announced the acquisition of seized vehicles for the Arecibo Municipal Police in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Department of Justice, among them a Hayabusa. Like the Hayabusas owned by the PRPD, this Hayabusa has been outfitted with lights, sirens and police livery to be used as a patrol vehicle in Villas del Capitán Correa, located at the northern part of the town.
==Other uses of the Hayabusa engine==
The high-powered lightweight engine in the Hayabusa lends itself to non-motorcycle applications. The Westfield Megabusa is an English sports car, based on the Lotus Seven, which uses the Hayabusa engine. Suzuki was the first to put the motorcycle&#x27;s engine in a car, with two concept cars in 2001, the Suzuki GSX-R/4 roadster and the Formula Hayabusa, an open wheel race car &quot;designed for a new Japanese one-make competition series.&quot;

Mike Akatiff&#x27;s 2004 land speed record attempt TOP 1 Ack Attack streamliner used twin Hayabusa engines in an attempt to exceed at Bonneville Salt Flats. In 2006 and again in 2008 Akatiff&#x27;s Ack Attack, ridden by Rocky Robinson, succeeded, first going in 2006, only to be surpassed two days later, then returning in 2008 to set another new record of . That record stood until 24 September 2009, when it was broken by Chris Carr with a speed of .

Radical Sportscars use the Hayabusa engine in stock form in their SR1 entry level race car and in a modified form up to 1.6L in their SR3 and PR6 cars. They also designed a V8 engine based on the inline-four Hayabusa engine using dual Hayabusa cylinder heads mated to a custom bottom end, known as the Powertec RPA V8 engine to power their SR8 car. The sports car set the record for the fastest production car at Nürburgring.

John Hartley, president of a custom printing machine manufacturer, created a 75° V8 engine producing and torque that weighs , based on the Hayabusa engine, initially intended to power his Caterham Seven sports car. One of Hartley&#x27;s engines has also been put in an Ariel Atom open wheel roadster.

SmartBUSA sells a conversion kit to install Hayabusa engines in Smart Cars.

The Vitabusa is a race car original designed by West Racing Cars, appeared in PIC, Taiwan.

A project to build a modern replica of the 1939 Bugatti Model 100 air racer used twin Suzuki Hayabusa engines in place of the original design&#x27;s pair of supercharged straight-eight engine.

Hayabusa engines have been used in sandrails, lightweight space frame off-road vehicles for sand dune racing and recreation. While many sandrails used in events like the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge have relied on car V8 engines, lighter motorcycle engine like the Hayabusa 1300 gives the sand car advantages in acceleration and maneuverability.

Introducing the Suzuki Vision Gran Turismo: the &#x27;Hayabusa&#x27; Engine and Electrification Technology in an AWD Super Sport The base chassis is a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout with a front mid-mounted engine, but adds electrification technology to combine the engine with electric motors, to complete the all-wheel drive system. The front mid-mounted engine is a 1340 cc inline 4 cylinder used on Suzuki&#x27;s ‘Hayabusa’ flagship sports bike. Furthermore, a total of three motors, two for the front drive and one for the rear drive, have been added. The combined total output of the system is 318 kW (432 PS) / 9700 rpm, with a maximum torque of 610 Nm (62 kgfm).
The Hayabusa engine has also proven a popular choice for use in single seaters within the British Hillclimb Championship, due to the integrated gearbox and light weight packaging. They are used in various configurations, ranging from stock sized engines, enlarged naturally aspirated engines, supercharged and turbocharger conversions. It is also not uncommon to see these engines run on methanol fuel, since it allows the naturally aspirated engines to run higher compression ratios and the force induction engines to not use an intercooler, thus further saving weight in the car. One of the more successful Hayabusa powered single seaters is the GWR Raptor, designed by Graeme Wight Jr. These cars have produced up to 480 hp while weighing less than 400 kg with a driver aboard and prove competitive against the larger, heavier and more powerful V8 cars.

<text>In sailing, a course is a type of square sail. It is the sail set on the lowest yard on a mast. The courses are given a name derived from the mast on which they are set, so the course on the foremast may be called the fore-course or the foresail; similarly main-course or mainsail for that carried on the mainmast. On the mizzen, a course is not usually carried. If it is, it is called the crossjack (or cro&#x27;jack) or mizzen sail. The lower yard on the mizzen takes the same name (crossjack). When there is no sail set from this yard it is still needed to sheet home the topsail. In that case, a clue to the arrangement is the absence of footropes.

<text>The Walking Purchase, also known as the Walking Treaty, was a 1737 agreement between the family of William Penn, the original proprietor of the Province of Pennsylvania, and the Lenape native Indians. In the purchase, the Penn family and proprietors produced a deed to claim that a 1686 treaty with the Lenape ceded an area of 1,200,000 acres (4,860 km2) in present-day Lehigh Valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania in colonial Pennsylvania, which included a western land boundary extending as far west as a man could walk in a day and a half, which led to its name. 

The area is along the northern reaches of the Delaware River, on Pennsylvania&#x27;s border with what was called, at the time, West Jersey. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; refers to the treaty as a &quot;land swindle&quot;. The Lenape appealed to the Iroquois Indian tribe to their north for aid on the issue, but the Iroquois refused their request, ultimately siding with the Penn interests.

Nearly 300 years later, in 2004, a lawsuit was filed over the continuing dispute. In the case, &quot;Delaware Nation v. Pennsylvania&quot;, the Delaware Tribe, one of three later federally-recognized Lenape tribes, and its descendants in the 21st century claimed of land included in the original purchase in 1737, but the U.S. District Court granted the Commonwealth&#x27;s motion to dismiss. It ruled that the case was nonjusticiable, even if the Delaware Nation&#x27;s allegations of fraud were factually accurate. This ruling was upheld through several appeals in the United States courts of appeals, which culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court refusing to hear the case, thereby upholding the lower courts&#x27; decision.

==History==
===17th century===


In 1681, the founder of the Province of Pennsylvania, William Penn, enjoyed a reputation for fair dealing with the Lenape. However, William Penn&#x27;s two sons, John and Thomas, largely abandoned their father&#x27;s moderate practices.

===18th century===
In 1736, they claimed a deed from 1686 under which the Lenape promised to sell a tract that extended from a point on the Delaware River near present-day Wrightstown, northwest into the interior &quot;as far as a Man could walk in a day and half,&quot; a typical Indian measurement of space. The agreement later became known as the &quot;Walking Purchase&quot; or the Walking Treaty of 1737. 

The original 17th century document might have been a verbal agreement, an unsigned treaty, an unratified treaty, or an outright forgery. The Penns&#x27; agents, however, began selling land in the region in and around present-day Lehigh Valley along the Lehigh River prior to the Lenape vacating the still inhabited area.

To address the Lenape&#x27;s misgivings and suspicions, Penn Land Office Agent and provincial secretary James Logan produced a map that misrepresented the farther Lehigh River as the closer Tohickon Creek, and including a dotted line showing a seemingly reasonable path that the walkers would take. Satisfied that the land in question was not so terrible a price to honor the old deed, the Lenape signed on, making the now 1737 treaty official.

According to the popular account, Lenape leaders assumed that about 40 miles (60 km) was the longest distance that could be covered under these conditions. Provincial Secretary Logan hired the three fastest runners in the colony, Edward Marshall, Solomon Jennings, and James Yeates, to run on a prepared trail. They were supervised during the walk by Timothy Smith, then sheriff of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. 

The walk occurred on September 19, 1737; only Marshall finished, reaching the modern vicinity of present-day Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, 70 miles (113 km) to the north. At the end of the walk, Sheriff Smith drew a perpendicular line back toward the northeast, and claimed all the land east of these two lines ending at the Delaware River that now represents the border between eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey.

This resulted in an area of 1,200,932 acres (4,860 km2), only slightly smaller than the size of Rhode Island, located in seven present-day counties in eastern Pennsylvania: Pike, Monroe, Carbon, Schuylkill, Northampton, Lehigh, and Bucks.

The Delaware Tribe leaders appealed for assistance to the Iroquois confederacy tribe to the north, who claimed hegemony over the Delaware River, but the Iroquois leaders decided that it was not in their best interest to intervene on behalf of their southern neighbors since Iroquois leader Captain Logan already made a deal with the Iroquois to support the colonial side. As a result, the Lenape vacated the Walking Purchase lands in present-day eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey.

Lenape chiefs Lappawinsoe, Manawkyhickon, Sassoonan, Nenatcheehunt, and others continued protesting the arrangement, since the Lenape were forced into Shamokin and Wyoming River valleys, which were already crowded with other displaced tribes. Some Lenape later moved further west into the Ohio Country in present-day Western Pennsylvania and Ohio, and to southern and western regions in colonial New France in present-day Quebec. Because of the Walking Purchase, the Lenape grew to distrust the Pennsylvania government, and later brought suit in federal court.

==&quot;Delaware Nation v. Pennsylvania&quot;==
===Eastern District federal court (2004)===
In 2004, Delaware Nation, representing the Lenape, filed suit against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, seeking included in the 1737 Walking Purchase and patented in 1741, which was known as Tatamy&#x27;s Place. The court granted the Commonwealth&#x27;s motion to dismiss. According to the federal Eastern District Court:
The District Court recounted the Delaware Nation&#x27;s allegations:
The Delaware Tribe conceded that Thomas Penn had &quot;sovereign authority,&quot; but challenged the transaction on the ground that it was fraudulent. The court held that the justness of the extinguishment of aboriginal title is nonjusticiable, including in the case of fraud. Because the extinguishment occurred prior to the passage of the first Indian Nonintercourse Act in 1790, that Act did not avail the Delaware.

===Federal appellate courts (2006)===
In 2006, Delaware Nation&#x27;s appeal of the decision was heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, which upheld the earlier ruling of the District Court. The Third Circuit upheld that aboriginal title may validly be extinguished by fraud, and further held that the tribe had waived the issue of whether Penn was actually a sovereign purchaser. Moreover, the Circuit held that any grants to the tribe subsequent to the extinguishment could not re-establish aboriginal title. Therefore, the Circuit did not consider the merits of the tribe&#x27;s argument that:

The Circuit Court found it insufficient that the complaint alleged that Penn was &quot;accountable directly to the King of England.&quot;

Delaware Nation filed for the case to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case on appeal, upholding the prior rulings by the two federal courts in Philadelphia.

<text>The Bhutan national football team () represents Bhutan in men&#x27;s international football. The team is controlled by the governing body for football in Bhutan, the Bhutan Football Federation, which is a member of the Asian Football Federation and the regional body the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF). The national football team of Bhutan plays its home games at the national stadium, Changlimithang.

The side has consistently been ranked as one of the worst national teams in the world on both the official FIFA rankings and the Elo rating system. As of the end of November 2017, they have only won six competitive fixtures and have a goal difference of −279. The team have never qualified for the finals of a major tournament and, beyond friendlies and qualifying matches, their only participation in an official competition has been in the regional South Asian Games and the South Asian Football Federation Cup.

==History==

=== Beginning (1950s–1980s) ===
There is uncertainty around how the game was ultimately brought to Bhutan. During the colonial period in Bhutan, although it had signed treaties with the government of India which ceded control of its defence and foreign relations to the British, continued to function as an independent state and was never under the direct rule of the British government in India. Whereas Indians were introduced to football by the British government, the lack of a permanent British presence in Bhutan meant that foreign sports were not played there. The arrival of football in Bhutan was very closely linked with the opening of schools in Haa and Paro in the 1950s, as foreign teachers, mainly from India but some from Europe, were recruited. The Bhutan Football Federation note that in the beginning there was little in the way of formal facilities or equipment and the game was played on stone-covered pitches with a ball made from a bundle of clothes. The game continued to grow as more Bhutanese went abroad, mainly to India, to study and helped increase the popularity of the sport upon their return, though the game was still considered to be just that and was not really developed during this period.

The main centers for football during the 1960s were Phuentsholing and Samtse, close to the border with India, where hastily arranged teams would travel back and forth over the border to play neighboring tea gardens. In 1968, a team nominally representing Bhutan, but essentially consisting of foreign players traveled to Calcutta to compete in the Indian Independence Cup. Over time football gradually increased in popularity until it was seen as an essential part of the school curriculum, with numerous school tournaments established within Thimphu. Teams used to travel from all over the country to take part, some coming from as far away as Khaling. However, regardless of the popularity of the game amongst the Bhutanese, the notion of a Bhutan &quot;national team&quot; consisting almost entirely of foreigners persisted for some time, and this team would regularly travel abroad to take part in international competitions such as the ANFA Cup, with a team consisting of around 60% Indian players. These Indian players were brought to Bhutan and given jobs within the Civil Service, although essentially their role was to play football.

In the late 1970s and early 1980, as well as playing several matches in Bhutan, the representative team, known as Druk 11, also played a number of games outside the country in Nepal and India, against representative teams such as the Food Corporation of India. At that time, eight out of the eleven members of the team were from India. Such a situation could not last, however, and in time these players either retired or returned to their home country creating a vacuum of talent which would seriously affect the national team in the years to come.

Given that the first international competition had been taking place since 1872, Bhutan&#x27;s official entry into the international arena was comparatively late, playing their first match only in 1982, a 3–1 loss to Nepal in the 1982 ANFA Cup. However, other sources also indicate that a team representing Bhutan travelled to Nepal eight years earlier and won a tournament known as the Shripanch Mahendra Gold Cup, though it is not clear the extent to which this was a true international tournament or whether they were competing against club teams. They also played a representative team from China&#x27;s Kunming Army Unit in the competition, also losing 3–1. Unfortunately, the scorers for Bhutan are not recorded, so it is unknown who scored Bhutan&#x27;s first international goal. Bhutan&#x27;s involvement in the ANFA Cup came some seven years before the inauguration of their own league competition. Again however, sources are contradictory with some indicating that a tournament that at least shared the name &quot;A-League&quot; was established in Thimphu sometime around the beginning of the 1980s.

Despite the at best fledgling nature of their domestic competition at that time, Bhutan continued to put out a side, this time in the South Asian Games. They entered the first games in 1984, but lost all three of their games, 2–0 to Bangladesh, 5–0 to hosts and eventual winners Nepal and 1–0 to the Maldives to finish last out of the four competing teams. It is unclear whether a play-off for third place was held between Bhutan and the Maldives. If it was, then the result is not known. Either way, the bronze medal was awarded to the Maldives.

Undeterred, Bhutan sent a team to the following year&#x27;s competition in Bangladesh. Results went the same way as the prior year&#x27;s tournament. Bhutan were drawn in group B of the competition along with India and Nepal. They lost their first match narrowly, 1–0 to Nepal and were beaten 3–0 by eventual champions India to ensure that they finished bottom of the group and did not progress.

The national team did not play any fixtures for the next two years as the South Asian Games moved to become a biennial competition, though they again sent a team to the third edition of the games in Kolkata, India. Drawn in group B again, this time with Nepal and Bangladesh, history repeated itself, as Bhutan lost first to Bangladesh 3–0, with Badal Das, Khurshid Alam Babul and Ahmed Ali scoring for Bangladesh, and then 6–2 to Nepal. Whilst their two goals ended a five-year, six-game scoring drought, they were thoroughly outclassed as Ganesh Thapa scored five times for Nepal.

=== Stagnation (1990s–2000s) ===
Despite establishing the first recorded football league in Bhutan in 1986, and while the Bhutan Football Federation was admitted as member of the AFC in 1994, the national team did not compete in any matches following their defeat to Nepal in the South Asian Games until 1999, missing four editions of the Games, returning only in 1999.

Their absence from the international arena had not seen an improvement in the standard of their football, even though there had been a national championship established in the country for the previous four seasons. Their first game against hosts Nepal ended in a resounding 7–0 defeat. The team found themselves 3–0 down within the first twenty minutes as Hari Khadka scored in the first and fifth minutes, with Naresh Joshi extending the lead after eighteen. Bhutan were able to keep Nepal at bay for the rest of the half, but conceded two more either side of the hour mark courtesy of Deepak Amatya and Rajan Rayamajhi before a brace from Basanta Thapa sealed an emphatic victory for Nepal. They performed better defensively in their next match, but still lost 3–0 to India, Vijayam Imivalappil scoring all three goals for India. Out of the competition, Bhutan faced a dead-rubber against Pakistan, who were also eliminate prior to the fixture following losses to India and Nepal. With nothing to play for, they produced their best performance of the tournament. Dinesh Chhetri opened the scoring for Bhutan in the twenty-first minute, the first time they had led a game in their history, only to see a potential victory disappear following two-second-half goals for Pakistan from Haroon Yousaf.
At the turn of the century, having spent the best part of the last two decades competing only against teams within South Asia, Bhutan made their first foray into international football at a continental level, competing in the qualification rounds for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup. This tournament was to be one of the lowest points in the history of the admittedly hastily assembled national team. An opening 3–0 loss to Nepal was perhaps not surprising, with Bhutan never having gained any form of positive result against their Himalayan neighbours, and at this point in time having scored against them only once in the ANFA Cup back in 1982. Four days later they faced Kuwait and were beaten 20–0. Seven of the ten Kuwaiti outfield players got their names on the scoresheet that day, including Bashar Abdullah who scored eight and Jassem Al-Houwaidi who scored five. Bhutan were seriously hampered in this game by their years in the footballing wilderness, but did not help themselves in the match conceding four penalties in total for what were described as &quot;rugby-like challenges&quot; and having two players sent off. This defeat was a world record international defeat, though this most undesirable of records was only held for fourteen months when Australia beat Tonga 22–0. As of 2016 this remains their worst ever result. Further heavy defeats were to follow, an 8–0 loss to Turkmenistan was followed by an 11–2 defeat to Yemen. Following this qualifying tournament, having been established in 1983, the Bhutan Football Federation was admitted as the 204th member of FIFA.

===The Other Final (2002)===

Their defeats in 2000 in AFC Cup qualifying had left Bhutan ranked as the world&#x27;s second worst national team with thirteen points in the official FIFA rankings, sandwiched between American Samoa above and Montserrat below. At this time, following the Netherlands failure to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, two Dutch ad-agency partners, Johan Kramer and Matthijs de Jongh, not having their home team to cheer on pondered who the worst team in the world might be. With Bhutan and Montserrat so close to each other at the bottom of the FIFA rankings, they set out to arrange a match between the two nations. Montserrat, their only pitch having been destroyed by one of the island nation&#x27;s seven active volcanoes, agreed to the match and travelled to Bhutan for the game, held at Changlimithang a few hours before the actual World Cup Final, a match authorised by FIFA. The game started strongly for Montserrat and Bhutan struggled to contain them during early exchanges. However, initial nerves were settled after five minutes when Wangay Dorji headed a goal to give Bhutan the lead. This gave them the momentum to press on, but their finishing was lax and they were unable to convert the chances they created. Montserrat were able to keep Bhutan at bay for the rest of the half and the game remained at 1–0 until well past the hour mark when English referee Steve Bennett awarded Bhutan a freekick. Dorji stepped up and scored his second of the game. The momentum remained with Bhutan and veteran striker Dinesh Chhetri scored a third before Dorji took full advantage of a tiring Montserratian team to complete his hat-trick and seal a 4–0 victory, Bhutan&#x27;s first victory on the international stage against any opposition, indeed their first-ever result of any kind and the first time they had ever kept a clean sheet.

=== Slow regression (2003–present) ===
However, despite this memorable victory, Bhutan was unable to carry this form forward into competitive matches. Although the Bhutan Football Federation now received substantial payments as a member of FIFA, there was still very little money in the game for players, even those who played for the national team. Players who were unemployed outside football had to exist on a stipend from the Federation of only Nu 3–5,500 per month and there were no internationally certified coaches in the country at all, only amateurs and school teachers. It is no surprise then that Bhutan was defeated in all three games in the 2003 South Asian Football Federation Gold Cup, losing 6–0 to the Maldives, 2–0 to Nepal and 3–0 to hosts Bangladesh, returning home bottom of their group without scoring a single goal. They took advantage though in their next set of matches as they hosted Group F of the preliminary qualifying round for the 2004 AFC Asian Cup. Drawn with Guam and Mongolia, two teams ranked much closer to them than the majority of their previous opposition, they began their campaign with a 6–0 victory over Guam (a result that as of 2016 is still their record victory) and followed it up with a 0–0 draw against Mongolia to top their group and progress to the qualifying round proper. The victory over Guam was their biggest ever margin of victory to date and the two games undefeated in this group represents Bhutan&#x27;s best run of form to date as of 2014. In the next stage though they were drawn against much stronger opposition in the shape of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Yemen. Faced with this increase in quality, Bhutan were outclassed in all six of their qualifying games, losing all of them and again failing to score a single goal in the process.

Their losing run continued into the 2005 South Asian Football Federation Gold Cup, where yet again they were to return home winless, losing 3–0 to Bangladesh and India respectively and 3–1 to Nepal, Bikash Pradhan scoring their only goal of the tournament, a consolation goal with Nepal already 3–0 up in what was a dead rubber for both sides.

From 2006 to 2009 saw something of an improvement in results for Bhutan. Entering the inaugural AFC Challenge Cup, they suffered narrow defeats to Nepal, 2–0 and Sri Lanka 1–0, before holding Brunei to a 0–0 draw. Although they failed to score and did not progress to the main competition, the draw against Brunei was their first positive result of any kind for nearly three years following a similar 0–0 draw with Mongolia and ended an eleven match losing streak. They did not play any international matches for the next two years, appearing again on the continental stage in the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup. Their performance was similar to the previous Challenge Cup, opening with a 3–1 loss to Tajikistan, Passang Tshering scoring for Bhutan after sixty-nine minutes, only for the Tajiks to seal the victory from the penalty spot in the dying minutes through Numonjon Hakimov. Bhutan achieved a better result in the next game, drawing 1–1 with Brunei. Nawang Dendhup gave Bhutan the initial advantage, a lead which they held until the seventy-sixth minute when Khayrun Bin Salleh equalized. Although a 3–0 loss to the Philippines in their final group game confirmed that again Bhutan would not be progressing to the competition proper. However, the two goals they scored and the draw achieved, meant that they finished in third place in the group above Brunei.

Bhutan built on the positive results they had gained from the previous two tournaments when they took part in the 2008 SAFF Championship. A late Nima Sangay goal was sufficient to give them a share of the points in their opening game against Bangladesh. They could not repeat the performance against the hosts Sri Lanka in their next game, losing 2–0, but recovered in their final game to record a 3–1 victory over Afghanistan, Yeshey Gyeltshen scoring twice and his namesake Yeshey Dorji getting the third before H.A. Habib scored a consolation for the Afghans. Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh in the other final group game to ensure that Bhutan finished as runners-up in the group and qualified for the knock-out rounds of a tournament for the first time in their history. They met India in the semi-finals and took the lead through Kinley Dorji after eighteen minutes. It was a lead they would hold for less than fifteen minutes though as Sunil Chhetri equalized before halftime. With no further goals in the second half, the game went to extra time only for Bhutan to see the possibility of victory snatched from them at the very last moment as Gouramangi Singh scored in added time at the end of extra time to claim the narrowest of victories for India. Nonetheless, the semi-final appearance is Bhutan&#x27;s best performance in any tournament as of 2016.

Unfortunately, they were again not able to build on these positive performances. Their loss to India was the start of the longest losing streak in their history, which was ultimately to last for nineteen games. The 2010 AFC Challenge Cup qualifying competition began with a narrow 1–0 loss to the Philippines, but quickly worsened as Bhutan lost 7–0 to Turkmenistan and 5–0 to the Maldives to return home yet again without a point or scoring.

A Passang Tshering goal was of little consolation as a 2–1 friendly loss to Nepal failed to end the streak, before a similarly poor 2009 SAFF Championship saw them lose 4–1 to Bangladesh, 6–0 to Sri Lanka and 7–0 to Pakistan, a Nawang Dendhup penalty against Bangladesh being their only reward in all three games.
Bhutan withdrew from the international stage for the next two years, re-emerging to play two back to back friendly matches against Nepal in preparation for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup. Both of these games resulted in narrow losses, 1–0 and 2–1. Their 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualification was essentially over before it started. Rather than being drawn in a group for initial qualification, the process was changed so that the lowest-ranked eight teams entering the competition played-off over two legs on a home-and-away basis. Bhutan perhaps suffered from the fact that neither leg was played in Bhutan, with both matches taking place at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium, Gurgaon, India, but nonetheless, a hat-trick from Sidiq Walizada in the first leg to give Afghanistan a 3–0 lead, made the second leg, which Afghanistan won 2–0, essentially irrelevant. A disappointing year was compounded with three successive defeats in the 2011 SAFF Championship, Bhutan losing 3–0 to Sri Lanka, 5–0 to India and finally 8–1 to Afghanistan, Chencho Gyeltshen&#x27;s consolation being the only positive from the year&#x27;s competition.

The team played only one match in 2012, a 5–0 lost friendly to Thailand, prior to the 2013 SAFF Championship. This tournament produced an almost identical result to the previous SAFF championship; Bhutan opened the competition losing 3–0 to Afghanistan, then 8–2 to the Maldives despite being 2–1 up at one point and level going into halftime, before rounding off another miserable year with a 5–2 loss to Sri Lanka. One of the main reasons suggested for Bhutan&#x27;s significant drop in form was the amount of money available to players, even those who played for the national team. Yeshey Dorji, one of the country&#x27;s leading players, announced his retirement following the 2013 SAFF Championships, citing an inability to generate a sufficient living from football as the main reason. In 2014, the Bhutan Football Federation withdrew the Nu 4,000 monthly payment to players in the national team, and whilst money is spent at grassroots, more needs to be spent on the national team as former national head coach Kazunori Ohara noted, once players get to the end of school age they often drop out of football completely.

====2018 FIFA World Cup qualification====
In 2015, Bhutan made their first ever attempt to qualify for the FIFA World Cup entering the qualifiers for the 2018 edition. In preparation for their qualifying campaign, and in an attempt to improve the overall standard of football in the country and attract more players, the Bhutan Football Federation offered a monthly salary of Ng 10,000 to all players in the main national squad who are not currently on federation scholarships.

In their first ever qualifying match, they faced Sri Lanka in the two-legged preliminary round. In the first leg in Colombo, Bhutan produced a shock result, beating their hosts 1–0, with Tshering Dorji scoring the winner in the eighty-fourth minute. This result even drew praise from now-disgraced FIFA president Sepp Blatter who described the result as &quot;a wonderful, historic moment&quot; on Twitter, though Sri Lanka coach Nikola Kavazovic, whilst conceding Bhutan were the better team remained confident that his team would ultimately be victorious. The result was met very positively in Bhutan, with the team featuring heavily in the news. Anticipation ahead of the second leg at Changlimithang ran high, a half-day holiday was declared by the government for students and public sector employees and the gates to the ground were opened four hours prior to kick off. The game started positively for Bhutan as Chencho Gyeltshen, the country&#x27;s only professional footballer, scored in the sixth minute. However, Sri Lanka equalised before half time through Subash Madushan. A disallowed goal for each side increased the tension as the game progressed but in injury time at the end of the second half Gyeltshen scored his second goal of the match to seal a 3–1 aggregate victory, ensuring they advanced to round 2 in the AFC qualifying section whilst Sri Lanka were eliminated. In qualifying for the second phase of the competition, Bhutan were guaranteed at least a place in the play-off round for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.

For the next stage, Bhutan were drawn in Group C, along with China, Qatar, Hong Kong, and the Maldives, all sides ranked higher than Sri Lanka in the FIFA rankings. Against these much stronger teams, their results were not as successful. In their first game, they lost 7–0 against Hong Kong in the Mong Kok Stadium, and then 6–0 less than a week later against China at Changlimithang, the first time despite their lowly ranking that Bhutan had been beaten at home in an official international match. Results got worse still in the following match as they lost 15–0 to Qatar, their heaviest defeat since their then world record 20–0 loss to Kuwait in 2000. The next two matches saw an improvement in their fortunes. Though both were lost, the scorelines were much more narrow. Firstly a 4–3 home defeat to the Maldives, in which Bhutan showed a spirited display to come back from 4–0 down in the final five minutes. At half time in the match, following a disagreement with team manager Hishey Tshering, coach Norio Tsukitate was sacked, his rigid methodology having created significant friction between himself and the overall team management. Secondly a 1–0 home loss to Hong Kong, the winning goal coming in the penultimate minute of the match for the visitors. This was a result that pleased the Bhutan Football Federation so much that they awarded all of the players involved in the match a Nu 25,000 bonus to reflect their &quot;brilliant performance&quot;. However the improvement in their performances was not to last and a visit to China resulted in a 12–0 loss, and a home match against Qatar another loss, this time 3–0.

Following their World Cup qualifying attempt, Bhutan entered the eleventh SAFF Championship, held in India between 23 December 2015 and 3 January 2016. Originally scheduled to take place in July 2015, the monsoon season and schedule congestion led to the tournament being postponed to late December. Their performance was identical to their efforts in the last four tournaments as the team lost all three group games beginning with a 3–1 defeat to the Maldives, Tshering Dorji scoring for Bhutan after 20 minutes, and followed by two 3–0 losses to Afghanistan and Bangladesh to be eliminated from the competition.

Prior to their last qualifying match, the national team visited Thailand where they played two back to back charity friendly matches against reigning Thai League T1 champions Buriram United. Although they were playing against a club side rather than a fellow national team, Bhutan were soundly beaten in both matches; firstly 6–0 and then 9–0 in a rematch the following day, with Buriram&#x27;s new signing Weslley scoring five times across the two matches.

A final 4–2 defeat against the Maldives in Malé confirmed Bhutan&#x27;s last place finish in their group with a −47 goal difference and extending their losing run in official competition to twelve games.

====2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification====
Bar the initial victories over Sri Lanka, one of the few positives to be taken from their inaugural World Cup qualifying campaign was that their presence in the second round guaranteed their qualification for the qualifying playoff round of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. Two rounds of play-off matches were played to determine the final eight qualifiers for the third round. The draw was made on 7 April 2016, at the AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The first round of matches were played between 2 and 7 June 2016 and the second round of matches between 6 September and 11 October 2016. As the lowest ranked of all the teams taking part in the play-off round, Bhutan entered in round two, where they were drawn against Bangladesh. The first match was played on 6 September, with the second leg played on 11 October 2016. Bhutan drew the first leg 0–0, breaking a twelve match losing streak in official matches and a fifteen match losing streak in total. Bhutan ended up winning the second match 3–1, giving them a 3–1 advantage on aggregate and enabling them to advance to round three of the Asian Cup qualification. Bhutan were drawn on 23 January 2017 with Maldives, Palestine and Oman; the draw was moved from 18 January. The Bhutanese were eliminated from contention after four straight losses, especially a 10–0 away loss to Palestine.

====2022 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Bhutan were eliminated when they lost 5–1 on aggregate to Guam. They won the first match at home 1–0 but lost the return leg 5–0.

===Colours===
Bhutan&#x27;s current home colours are orange shirts with yellow trim and a yellow dragon motif, orange shorts and orange socks. Their away colours is predominantly white with orange trim on the shirt and shorts and an orange dragon motif. Both their home and away colours are so closely aligned to the national colours and pattern of the Flag of Bhutan that they essentially mirror it. The current manufacturer of the national colours is Nivia.

There are three main themes contained within Bhutan&#x27;s home colours, all of which have wider symbolism within the nation as outlined in the Constitution of Bhutan. Firstly, the use of orange signifies Buddhist spiritual tradition, particularly the Drukpa Kagyu and Nyingma schools. Secondly, the use of yellow in the trim and also as the colour of the dragon motif signifies civil tradition and temporal authority as embodied in the Druk Gyalpo, the Dragon King of Bhutan, whose royal garb traditionally includes a yellow kabney (scarf). Finally, the dragon motif employed is the Druk () the &quot;Thunder Dragon&quot; of Bhutanese mythology and a Bhutanese national symbol, though the dragon depicted in the team&#x27;s colours does not hold the jewels representing wealth that are found on the national flag, though the similar snarling mouth of the dragon symbolizes the Bhutanese deities&#x27; commitment to the defense of Bhutan.

The orange theme and that of the dragon motif noted above are carried over into the away colours. Additionally, the predominant white theme mirrors the colour of the dragon on the national flag which signifies the purity of inner thoughts and deeds that unite all the ethnically and linguistically diverse peoples of Bhutan.

===Logo===
The logo of the national team is identical to that used for its governing body, the Bhutan Football Federation. It consists of a football surrounded by two concentric circles, one yellow, one orange, representing the Dragon King of Bhutan and the Buddhist tradition in the country, overlaid on a Himalayan blue poppy (&quot;Meconopsis horridula&quot;), the national flower of Bhutan. Below this is a wish-fulfilling jewel, similar to that located at the top of the official Emblem of Bhutan.

==Home stadium==

Changlimithang Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Thimphu, Bhutan, which serves as the National Stadium. The stadium can holds a capacity of 15,000. It is predominantly used for football matches and is the home of both the Bhutan national football team and a number of Thimphu-based football clubs who play in both the A-Division and the National League. In addition to football, the stadium also regularly plays host to major archery tournaments, the national sport of Bhutan. The stadium was initially constructed in 1974 for the coronation of the fourth Druk Gyalpo, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, but was completely refurbished in 2007 in advance of the coronation of the fifth Druk Gyalpo, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Floodlighting was added to the football pitch in 2009 and an artificial pitch was laid in 2012 to coincide with the start of the first season of the National League. Unusually for a national stadium, and as a result of the conversion of the playing surface to artificial turf, the football field at Changlimithang is available for public hire and is extremely popular with people in Thimphu.

==Rankings==

===FIFA===
Prior to the victories over Sri Lanka, their highest FIFA ranking achieved was 187th, which they last reached in December 2008 following their semi-final performance in the 2008 SAFF Championship. From that high point, they slipped down the rankings to last place in December 2012 to join San Marino and the Turks and Caicos Islands in 207th. They fell to 208th place following the admission to FIFA of South Sudan in July 2014, and dropped to 209th as the only team without ranking points following San Marino&#x27;s draw with Estonia. However, Bhutan rose to 163rd on the FIFA rankings after two victories over Sri Lanka in World Cup qualifying, achieving their highest ranking ever in April 2015. They then rose to 156th in June 2015. However, following their performance in the second round of world cup qualifying in which they have failed to win a game, they slipped back to 193rd as of February, but have since risen to 185th as of November 2017.
===Elo ratings===
The team is also ranked extremely low on the all time Elo ratings at 227th out of 234 as of December 2017. There is one FIFA affiliated team ranked below them, American Samoa. Their initial comparatively high position in the 1980s was more to do with the number of nations competing globally at the time than their specific performances. Since they have started competing with a degree of regularity on the continental scene, Bhutan have always hovered at or near the bottom of the ratings. Their high point in the 21st century was 218th as a result of their performance at the 2008 SAFF Championship.

<doc id="1136001" wikidata="Q10769613" url="?curid=1136001" title="Elbow Cay">
<text>Elbow Cay is a cay in the Abaco Islands of The Bahamas. Originally populated by British loyalists fleeing the newly independent United States of America in 1785, it has survived on fishing, boat building, and salvage. Its main village of Hope Town surrounds a protected harbor with a noted red-and-white-striped lighthouse built in 1863. On September 1, 2019, Elbow Cay took a direct hit from Category 5 Hurricane Dorian, with sustained winds of 185 mph (295 km/h). The lighthouse survived.

==Geography==

Elbow Cay is located about east of Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco Island. Most visitors fly into Marsh Harbour and take the ferry to either Hope Town at the Northern end of Elbow Cay or White Sound, a mid-island harbour and settlement developed in 1960. At the Southern end of the island is Tahiti Beach near Doros Cove. The Atlantic Ocean runs along the entire Eastern coast of Elbow Cay, while the South Abaco Sound is on the western coast.

Elbow Cay is between Man-O-War Cay to the north and Tiloo Cay to the south. Lubbers Quarters Cay is west of the southern End of Elbow Cay.

==History==
Although visited by Lucayan Indians earlier, the first known permanent residents arrived in 1785 in what was known as Great Harbour. Wyannie Malone, originally from Charleston, South Carolina and other British Loyalists left the United States for the nearest British territory in The Bahamas.

Elbow Cay and the Abacos were very isolated until the Marsh Harbour Airport was built in 1959. Before that, the residents survived by fishing, limited trading, and salvage of ships wrecked on Elbow Reef. Since then, contact with the outside world has brought in additional residents and tourism.

Hope Town originally served as the administrative centre of the Abacos, until it switched over to Marsh Harbour in the 1960s.

In 2015, a faring from a SpaceX rocket drifted ashore on Elbow Cay.

==Today==
Hope Town is the largest settlement which contains several grocery stores including Vernons Grocery run by a descendant of Wyannie Malone, rental properties and restaurants. Cars and golf carts can drive up to, but not through Hopetown. Further south, there are more residences and rental properties spread out along the roads to the narrow part of the island near White Sound. The Abaco Inn and Seaspray properties offer rooms and restaurants. At the Southern end of the island is Tahiti Beach with a beautiful sand beach and nearby snorkelling in Tiloo Cut, the inlet separating Elbow Cay from Tiloo Cay.

There is telephone service, but most residents depend on the VHF radios to communicate.

==Hurricanes==
Elbow Cay suffered significant damage in 1999 from Hurricane Floyd. It nearly cut a new inlet near White Sound. The road remains damaged to this day.

On September 1, 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall on Elbow Cay at 16:40 UTC with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and wind gusts up to 225 mph (360 km/h), tying Dorian with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane of all time in terms of sustained winds. ABC News reported damage as &quot;catastrophic&quot; and &quot;pure hell&quot;, throughout the island.

==In popular culture==
The episodes &quot;My Soul on Fire&quot; (Part 1 and 2) of the TV series &quot;Scrubs&quot; were filmed on the island for the Janitor and Lady&#x27;s wedding. The lighthouse and other businesses were shown in the episode.

Patterson studied fiction writing with Jesse Hill Ford at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; his first short story was published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;; and his first novel, &quot;The Lasko Tangent&quot;, won an Edgar Allan Poe Award in 1979. Between 1981 and 1985, he published &quot;The Outside Man&quot;, &quot;Escape the Night&quot;, and &quot;Private Screening&quot;, which made the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list in 1994. His first novel in eight years, &quot;Degree of Guilt&quot; (1993), and &quot;Eyes of A Child&quot; (1995), were combined into a four-hour TV mini-series by NBC TV, called &quot;Degree of Guilt&quot;. Both were international bestsellers, and &quot;Degree of Guilt&quot; was awarded the French Grand Prix de Littérature Policière in 1995. &quot;The Final Judgment&quot; (1995), &quot;Silent Witness&quot; (1997), &quot;No Safe Place&quot; (1998), and &quot;Dark Lady&quot; (1999) all became immediate international bestsellers, and in 2011 &quot;Silent Witness&quot; became a feature film on TNT. &quot;Protect and Defend&quot; (2000), about the controversial nomination of the first woman to be Chief Justice, and her entanglement in an incendiary lawsuit regarding late-term abortion and parental consent, was a #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and received a Maggie Award from Planned Parenthood for its treatment of issues regarding reproductive rights. In 2013, the London &quot;Guardian Literary Review&quot; named &quot;No Safe Place&quot; one of the 10 best works of fiction, nonfiction, or biography inspired by John F. Kennedy and the Kennedy assassination in the 50 years since his death.

&quot;Balance of Power&quot; (2003) confronted one of America&#x27;s most divisive issues—gun violence—and was chosen by &quot;USA Today&quot; as its book of the month selection for November. &quot;Conviction&quot; (2005) focused on the law and politics of capital punishment. &quot;Exile&quot; (2007) dealt with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was nominated for South Africa&#x27;s leading literary award. &quot;The Race&quot; (2007) concerned a dramatic campaign for president, and &quot;Eclipse&quot; (2009) dealt with human rights, Africa, and the geopolitics of oil. &quot;The Spire&quot; (2009) was a novel of psychological suspense, and &quot;In the Name of Honor&quot; (2010) portrays a military court martial for murder, and a legal defense based on PTSD. &quot;The Devil’s Light&quot; (2011) is an exhaustively researched depiction of the world of espionage and the potential for nuclear terrorism, focused on an Al Qaeda plot to steal a nuclear bomb from Pakistan in order to destroy a major western city.

Patterson&#x27;s twentieth novel, &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; (2012), a family drama set on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, became his sixteenth &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

<text>Gilbert Van Tassel Hamilton (1877–1943) was an American physician and writer. He was the author of &quot;Introduction to Objective Psychopathology&quot;, one of the leading early manuals on psychopathology, and of &quot;A Research in Marriage&quot;, a pioneering report on sexual activity that was one of the references used by Havelock Ellis in writing &quot;Psychology of Sex&quot;.

Born in Frazeysburg, Ohio, in 1877, Hamilton was the son of an Ohio merchant. He received his university education at Ohio Wesleyan University, graduating with the AB in 1898. After completing his degree, he enrolled at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, where he studied the treatment of nervous and mental disorders.

<doc id="1136057" wikidata="Q5116433" url="?curid=1136057" title="Chunking (computing)">
<text>In computer programming, chunking has multiple meanings.

==In memory management== 
Typical modern software systems allocate memory dynamically from structures known as heaps. Calls are made to heap-management routines to allocate and free memory. Heap management involves some computation time and can be a performance issue. Chunking refers to strategies for improving performance by using special knowledge of a situation to aggregate related memory-allocation requests. For example, if it is known that a certain kind of object will typically be required in groups of eight, instead of allocating and freeing each object individually, making sixteen calls to the heap manager, one could allocate and free an array of eight of the objects, reducing the number of calls to two.

==In HTTP message transmission==

Chunking is a specific feature of the HTTP 1.1 protocol. Here, the meaning is the opposite of that used in memory management. It refers to a facility that allows inconveniently large messages to be broken into conveniently-sized smaller &quot;chunks&quot;.

==In data deduplication, data synchronization and remote data compression==
In data deduplication, data synchronization and remote data compression, Chunking is a process to split a file into smaller pieces called chunks by the chunking algorithm. It can help to eliminate duplicate copies of repeating data on storage, or reduces the amount of data sent over the network by only selecting changed chunks. The Content-Defined Chunking (CDC) algorithm like Rolling hash and its variants have been the most popular data deduplication algorithms for the last 15 years.

<text>Guy Benton Johnson (February 28, 1901 – March 23, 1991) was an American sociologist and social anthropologist. He was a student of black culture in the rural South and an advocate of racial equality.

==Biography==
Johnson was born in Caddo Mills, Texas on February 28, 1901. He married Guion Griffis, a noted historian, and together they had two sons: Guy Benton Jr. and Edward. Johnson died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on March 23, 1991, at the age of 90.

==Academic career==
Johnson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Baylor University and the University of Chicago, and a Master of Arts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (PhD, 1927). After teaching a year each at Ohio Wesleyan University and Baylor College for Women (now Mary-Hardin Baylor), Johnson was recruited to North Carolina as a research assistant in Howard W. Odum&#x27;s new Institute for Research in Social Science in 1924, which he never left for long. He taught at Chapel Hill from 1927 until he retired as Kenan Professor of Sociology and Anthropology in 1969.

His main writings were on Southern black folk culture and U.S. race relations. In &quot;Folk Culture&quot;, he analyzed the Gullah dialect of English spoken by blacks on that isolated South Carolina island and, in sophisticated technical detail, the musical structure of the spirituals they sang to support a new interpretation of black folk culture.

<doc id="1136070" wikidata="Q797044" url="?curid=1136070" title="BS 7799">
<text>BS 7799 was a British standard &quot;Code of Practice for Information Security Management&quot;, first published as such by the British Standards Institution (BSI) in February 1995. Read about the origins of BS 7799 here.

Subsequently, two further parts to BS 7799 were also published (the first becoming BS 7799 Part 1), by which time BSI had become BSI Group.

The original BS 7799 outlined a structured approach to the management of information security but was primarily a description of some 127 information security controls in 10 sections or categories. Each control was designed to address a specified control objective.

Some of the controls considered particularly important at the time were identified as &#x27;key controls&#x27; indicated with a key icon in the margin. Following pushback from the user and academic communities, however, the &#x27;key control&#x27; concept was dropped when BS 7799 was revised in 1998. Users were encouraged to determine their own risks and objectives in order to select whichever controls were appropriate to their needs - a more fundamental and flexible approach applicable to organisations of all types, sizes and industries.

After a lengthy discussion by standards bodies through ISO/IEC, BS 7799-1 was eventually fast-tracked and adopted as ISO/IEC 17799, &quot;Information Technology - Code of practice for information security management.&quot; in 2000. ISO/IEC 17799 was revised in June 2005, and renumbered ISO/IEC 27002 in July 2007 when it was incorporated into the growing ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards.

BS 7799 Part 2 &quot;Information Security Management Systems - Specification with guidance for use.&quot; was first published by BSI Group in 1999 as a formal specification supporting conformity assessment and certification. BS 7799-2 explained how to design and implement an information security management system (ISMS) - a systematic approach to the governance and management of information security within an organisation. The 2002 version of BS 7799-2 introduced the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) (Deming cycle), aligning it with quality standards such as ISO 9000. BS 7799 Part 2 was adopted by ISO/IEC as ISO/IEC 27001 in November 2005.

BS 7799 Part 3 &quot;Information security management systems - Guidelines for information security risk management&quot; was first published by BSI Group in 2005. BS 7799-3 focuses on the identification, analysis, treatment and monitoring of information risks. It was adapted and adopted by ISO/IEC as ISO/IEC 27005 in 2008. Meanwhile, BS 7799-3 continues to evolve in parallel. It was revised in 2017 and a project was proposed in 2023 to simplify the guidance specifically for smaller organisations.

<text>The Aislers Set is an American indie pop band that formed in San Francisco in 1997, after the breakup of chief songwriter Linton&#x27;s former band Henry&#x27;s Dress. The Aislers Set&#x27;s music is often interpreted as adjacent to C86-style British indie pop but the band&#x27;s style transcends genres. The founding members were A V Linton (guitar, vocals, multi-instrumentalist), Wyatt Cusick (guitar, vocals, multi-instrumentalist), Alicia Vanden Heuvel, (bass, vocals, piano, multi-instrumentalist), Yoshi Nakamoto (drums), and Jen Cohen (organ). The band was primarily active from 1998 to 2003, touring the U.S., Europe, and Japan, releasing three self-recorded albums, numerous singles and even recording a &quot;Peel Session&quot; in 2001.

==History==
The first record, &quot;Terrible Things Happen&quot;, was initially performed and recorded entirely by Linton before meeting who would become the live players and future collaborators in the band. Linton was interested in forming a band to play the songs they had recorded alone, and after meeting Wyatt Cusick (Trackstar) at a live show they met up, listened to the songs, and agreed to play. Cusick invited his friends Alicia Vanden Heuvel and Yoshi Nakamoto to these first rehearsals. A band formed and the group re-recorded a couple of songs so that the new members would be represented on the album. Additionally, Cusick wrote one song to contribute to the album. &quot;Terrible Things Happen&quot; was released in 1998, and the album received glowing reviews in &quot;CMJ&quot;, &quot;The Big Takeover&quot;, and numerous indie pop zines, earning enough of a following to generate a tour of Japan in April 1999. &quot;Terrible Things Happen&quot; (as with the rest of the Aislers Set&#x27;s music) was recorded in Linton&#x27;s tiny basement studio onto an Otari 1/2&quot; analog tape machine, and cut directly to lathe at Fantasy Studios by mastering engineer George Horn, an entirely analogue process.

&quot;Spin.com&quot; placed the band&#x27;s second album &quot;The Last Match&quot; on its Top 20 of 2000, saying, &quot;Linton has cleared the cobwebs off the Pop conundrum and dolled them up in a perfect dress.&quot; On &quot;Salon.com&quot;, Greil Marcus wrote, &quot;They make dream pop feel as easy to make as a can of soup, and as dangerous: Watch that jagged edge.&quot; The album was recorded by the band on Otari 8 track and mixed onto an Otari 1/4&quot; 2 track, again in Linton&#x27;s basement and Cusick and Vanden Heuvel&#x27;s home studio. High praise followed in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Gear&quot;, and &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, and the band set out on lengthy tours supporting acts such as Sleater Kinney and Bratmobile.

In early 2001, the band set off on a three-week tour of Europe which was highlighted by an invitation to record a session for legendary British DJ John Peel. They recorded four tracks for the show which was aired twice by Peel. He said of the band &quot;If you were in one of your difficult moods you could argue that there are lots of bands making that kind of noise particularly in the United States of America. And you&#x27;d say well, why are Aislers Set better than any of the others and I&#x27;d have to say, well I don&#x27;t know they just sort of are...&quot;

In 2002 the band was invited by Belle and Sebastian for a week-long tour of the East Coast, culminating in a show at New York City&#x27;s Hammerstein Ballroom in front of over 3,000 people. Stevie Jackson of Belle and Sebastian was later quoted in a 2003 &quot;SF Weekly&quot; article, observing that &quot;[t]hey are one of the best groups in America as far as I&#x27;m concerned&quot;.

Late in 2002, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; included The Aislers Set in its list of &quot;Young Artists on the Verge&quot;, writing, &quot;The Aislers Set&#x27;s reinvention of &#x27;60s pop resurrects walls of garage guitars and rich, Spector-esque sound, insouciance combined with insightful lyrics. But this quintet makes the past feel contemporary, borrowing from punk and pop to create a 21st century cool sound&quot;.

In 2002, The Aislers Set had to cancel an entire tour. On the evening before this lengthy tour Linton was hospitalized and unable to walk for many months after. Anxious fans and friends weighed in the diagnosis. After months of hospital visits and tests the results were inconclusive and could not explain the temporary paralysis or pain Linton suffered during this time.
The Aislers Set&#x27;s third album, &quot;How I Learned to Write Backwards&quot;, came out in spring 2003. Some of songs are just Linton experimenting with and getting back to making and recording music after recovering from many stressful months of hospitalisation and insufficient diagnosis. Others were fully fleshed out songs. It was recorded on a 16 track that the band purchased themselves, after expanding the space in Linton&#x27;s basement studio. &quot;NME&quot; wrote &quot;Sleighbells, Cuban trumpets, half-inched Smiths lyrics and chasms of lovely echo all add to an insomnia-like reverie that clings on long after its mere half-hour is up.&quot; &quot;When The Aislers Set hit their mark, they unveil a knack for tying together extremes without ever settling for the middle ground&quot; said &quot;MOJO magazine&quot;. Pitchfork Media stated with respect to the 2003 version of The Aislers Set: &quot;Here, Linton&#x27;s indie quintet becomes a pop orchestra. The band&#x27;s music is denser than ever before, laden with sleigh bells, handclaps and horns piled atop the conventional guitars, drums, bass and keyboards – and all are drenched in cavernous reverb, providing the ambiance and intimacy of a gigantic, empty concert hall&quot;.

The band toured for most of 2003 including a month-long stint supporting Yo La Tengo and a week supporting The Shins. 
Since late 2003 the band has been on hiatus with Linton having moved to New York City and Cusick moving to Gothenburg, Sweden.

On Christmas Day 2010, the band made a new song, &quot;Cold Christmas&quot;.

In September 2014, the group reunited to play four West Coast shows in celebration of their LP reissues.

<doc id="1136083" wikidata="Q5517192" url="?curid=1136083" title="Gaillard Island">
<text>Gaillard Island is an artificially created island located in Mobile Bay near Mobile, Alabama. It was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, using sand and mud dredged from the Mobile Bay ship channel and elsewhere. The island is an important site for colonial nesting seabirds and shore birds in coastal Alabama and has been the only nesting site for brown pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus occidentalis&quot;) in Alabama—first discovered in 1983.

==Geography==

The island is and is configured in a triangular shape. It is located approximately east of Theodore Industrial Park Complex and approximately to southeast of downtown Mobile, Alabama. Thirty-one million cubic yards of dredged material pulled from the bay and nearby land was used to form the island. The excavated material consisted primarily of hard red clay from the land and silty sand infused with small amounts of shell and gravel from the bottom of the bay.

The dredged material was transported by barge and hydraulically pumped to the island site to make the dikes. Tests were performed by the Corps of Engineers to determine how to maintain the island and not allow it to dissipate into the bay. A triangular shape was designed and floating tire breakwaters were used to protect the island from erosion due to wave action. Marsh plants were used to develop an established root system to assist with long term integrity of the island. This was a state-of-the-art technique which has been widely studied, found to be effective and is now used nationwide.

==History==
In 1979 Gaillard Island was created as a disposal island for a ship channel made to connect Mobile Bay and Theodore Industrial Park where a navy port was built. The project consisted of dredging a deep draft ship channel about long, wide and deep. The project was controversial from an engineering and environmental standpoint. The engineers thought the island would not hold up in an open body of water and the environmentalists were concerned about the impact on the bay from an ecological standpoint. The island has been a success from the onset and has become an environmental showcase, home to thousands of birds, particularly brown pelicans.

The island is named after Dr. M. Wilson Gaillard, a Mobile dentist. He was also an environmentalist who envisioned the island as a nesting haven for both shore and seabirds. The island is also known as Pelican Island by locals. The island is owned by the Alabama State Docks and managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

==Ecosystem==

Various birds were noted to be inhabiting the island by the time it was completed in 1981. In 1983 a biologist discovered four brown pelicans nesting on the island. This was the first sighting in Alabama since their decline due to hunting in the early 1900s. Pelican feathers, in that era, were used for women&#x27;s hats. Further decline came in the 1940s due to the widespread use of the pesticide DDT. At that time, they were placed on both the Alabama and federal endangered species list. Partly due to increased nesting and propagation of the brown pelicans on Gaillard Island, the brown pelican was removed from the state&#x27;s endangered species list in 1995, and in 2009, the brown pelican was removed from the federal endangered species list.

Today Gaillard Island is an important habitat for thousands of birds representing species of skimmers, stilts, terns, pelicans, egrets, herons, and ibis. Gaillard Island is also the only Alabama nesting site for Caspian terns, Sandwich terns, royal terns, and laughing gulls. The first recorded nesting of herring gulls occurred on Gaillard Island in 1986. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has closely monitored the colonial nesting shore and seabirds conducting annual surveys since 1998. During the first survey, they estimated that there were 10,000 nests on the island.

Vegetation is diverse on the island and consists of saltmeadow cordgrass, saltmarsh bulrush, salt marsh cattail, and American threesquare that naturally flourished behind the berms. Originally, smooth cordgrass was the only species that was planted.

A report by the Mobile Register in mid-2011 showed that pelican populations on the island dramatically increased from 2010. The report also indicated the pelicans on the island showed no effects stemming from the 2010 BP oil spill in terms of finding a reliable food source, a previous concern from environmental officials.

==Threats to the island==
The human factor is not a threat to the island as boaters and jet skiers can reach the sand beach but are prohibited from walking on the island which would disturb the nesting grounds and disrupt the ecosystem of the island. Three hurricanes, however, have damaged the island. They were Hurricanes Danny, Georges, and Katrina respectively. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) division approved $8.6 million of financial assistance to restore Gaillard Island after the tidal surge associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, eroded and destroyed the island&#x27;s levy and berm system.

==Sporting==
Bird watching is the primary sport associated with the island. The Mobile Bay Audubon Society conducts tours for local enthusiasts and conservationists. The spring months are the best time for viewing the nesting activities. As a side effect, marine life is abundant around the island making this area a favorite spot for fishermen who catch speckled trout, flounder and mullet. Shrimp are also harvested.

<doc id="1136090" wikidata="Q677891" url="?curid=1136090" title="Pig Destroyer">
<text>Pig Destroyer is an American grindcore band formed in 1997 in Alexandria, Virginia. The band was formed by vocalist J. R. Hayes, guitarist Scott Hull and drummer John Evans. Pig Destroyer is one of the most well-known grindcore bands due to Hayes&#x27; poetic lyrics, Hull&#x27;s incorporation of thrash metal, doom metal and punk influences in songwriting, and Evans&#x27; technical drum work.

== History ==
The band formed in 1997 after the break-up of a short-lived political hardcore band, Treblinka, with 2 former members of said band, vocalist J. R. Hayes (Enemy Soil), guitarist Scott Hull (Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Japanese Torture Comedy Hour, ex-Anal Cunt), and drummer John Evans, who left the band for an unspecified school not long after the band&#x27;s formation. After the departure of Evans, he was soon replaced by Brian Harvey.

In an interview, Scott Hull claims that they picked the band name on the criteria that it was insulting, yet somewhat more creative than the name of his last band, Anal Cunt. Deciding that &quot;Cop Killer&quot; or &quot;Cop Destroyer&quot; would be tactless, they eventually settled on &quot;Pig Destroyer&quot; (&quot;pig&quot; being a pejorative American slang term for the police). Derived from a non-musical source as extreme as the band&#x27;s sound, Pig Destroyer&#x27;s easily identifiable logo was created using a graphic from &quot;ANSWER Me!&quot; magazine as a template.
Relapse Records signed the band and issued a split 7-inch with Isis on the label&#x27;s Singles Series. &quot;38 Counts of Battery&quot; was a complete discography of Pig Destroyer releases up to the year 2000, which included split records with Gnob and influential screamo act Orchid, as well as their debut album, &quot;Explosions In Ward 6&quot;, and the demo that secured their record deal.

&quot;Prowler in the Yard&quot;, released in 2001, was the first of the band&#x27;s records to really break through to what could contextually be considered the &quot;mainstream&quot;. Garnering rave reviews from popular press such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Terrorizer&quot;, the record earned Pig Destroyer headlining slots at the 2002 New England Metal and Hardcore Festival and the 2002 Relapse Records CMJ Showcase, as well as a high placing at 2003&#x27;s Relapse Contamination Fest alongside scene legends High on Fire and The Dillinger Escape Plan (documented on the Relapse Contamination Fest DVD).

2004&#x27;s &quot;Terrifyer&quot; boasted a much clearer sound than &quot;Prowler in the Yard&quot; or &quot;38 Counts of Battery&quot;, as well as lyrics and prose from Hayes. The record came with an accompanying DVD soundscape entitled &quot;Natasha&quot;, which was intended to be listened to in surround sound (although a more recent Japanese edition of the album has &quot;Natasha&quot; as an ordinary CD with four bonus tracks). Session guitarist Matthew Kevin Mills, Hull&#x27;s former guitar teacher, recorded the lead guitar parts in the song &quot;Towering Flesh&quot;.

A compilation of tracks from the split EPs with Gnob and Benümb is also available, entitled &quot;Painter of Dead Girls&quot;. The album features alternative versions of older songs from the &quot;38 Counts&quot; era (such as &quot;Dark Satellites&quot;), a series of new songs (such as &quot;Rejection Fetish&quot; and &quot;Forgotten Child&quot;), and covers of bands who could be considered an influence (such as The Stooges and Helmet).

2007 saw the release of album &quot;Phantom Limb&quot; via Relapse Records, complete with album artwork designed by John Baizley (Baroness, Torche).

In 2011, Harvey was replaced by Misery Index drummer Adam Jarvis.

&quot;Book Burner&quot; was released on October 22, 2012. Pig Destroyer headlined the Terrorizer stage at the Damnation Festival in Leeds in November 2012, which marked their first United Kingdom show in eight years.

In March 2013, Pig Destroyer released an EP titled &quot;Mass &amp; Volume&quot; via Bandcamp. Recorded at the end of the &quot;Phantom Limb&quot; sessions, this EP was released as part of a charity effort to benefit the family of recently deceased Relapse Records employee Pat Egen. In September 2013, Adult Swim released the song &quot;The Octagonal Stairway&quot; as part of the 2013 Adult Swim Singles Series.

In October 2013, Adam Jarvis&#x27;s cousin John Jarvis joined Pig Destroyer as the band&#x27;s first bass player. In 2014, &quot;The Diplomat&quot; was featured prominently in the season finale of Comedy Central&#x27;s TV show &quot;Workaholics&quot;. In 2015, Relapse announced a deluxe reissue of the band&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Prowler In The Yard&quot;, which featured a remixed &amp; remastered version of the album in various limited formats.

At least seven official promotional videos have been made of Pig Destroyer songs: &quot;Piss Angel&quot;, from &quot;Prowler in the Yard&quot;; &quot;Gravedancer&quot;, from &quot;Terrifyer&quot;; &quot;Loathsome&quot;, from &quot;Phantom Limb&quot;; &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, from &quot;Book Burner&quot;; &quot;Army of Cops&quot;, &quot;The Torture Fields&quot;, and &quot;Mt. Skull&quot; from &quot;Head Cage&quot;. The first three have aired on MTV2&#x27;s Headbangers Ball, with each video seeing more airplay than the one that was released before it. The video for &quot;Piss Angel&quot; debuted on the show on August 14, 2004, and was directed by Kenneth Thibault and Nathaniel Baruch. The video for &quot;Gravedancer&quot; was directed by Vladimir Lik and released in 2007. The video for &quot;Loathsome&quot; was directed by David Brodsky and debuted in late 2007. The video for &quot;The Diplomat&quot; was directed by Phil Mucci and released on October 26, 2012. The video for &quot;Army of Cops&quot; was released on July 10, 2018. David Brodsky returned to direct the video. It was followed by the releases of &quot;The Torture Fields&quot; directed by Frank Huang, and &quot;Mt. Skull&quot;.

In early 2019 John Jarvis was dismissed from the band and replaced with Lody Kong guitarist Travis Stone.

In August 2020, Pig Destroyer released &quot;The Octagonal Stairway&quot;. Pornographers of Sound was released in June 2021.

In 2022, sound designer Blake Harrison left the band and was replaced by Alex Cha in 2023.

On March 10, 2024, Harrison died from sudden pneumonia and heart attack due to complications of his battle with melanoma.

== Influences ==
Scott Hull has mentioned artist Matthew Barney, author Dennis Cooper, and noise musicians Whitehouse as influencing his music. Pig Destroyer is inspired by thrash metal, such as Dark Angel and Slayer, the sludge metal of The Melvins, American grindcore as practiced by Brutal Truth, &amp; some releases are influenced by the metallic hardcore subgenre, specifically Prowler in the Yard &amp; Head Cage.

<doc id="1136098" wikidata="Q838544" url="?curid=1136098" title="Earache Records">
<text>Earache Records is a British independent record label, music publisher and management company founded by Digby Pearson in 1985, based in Nottingham, England, with offices in London and New York. The label helped to pioneer extreme metal by releasing early grindcore and death metal records between the late 1980s and mid-1990s. Its roster has since diversified into more mainstream guitar music, working with bands such as Rival Sons, the Temperance Movement, Blackberry Smoke, Scarlet Rebels and the White Buffalo. The company also hosted the &#x27;Earache Express&#x27; stage at Glastonbury Festival in 2017 and &#x27;The Earache Factory&#x27; at Boomtown 2018. The label&#x27;s logo is a homage to &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine, as Pearson was a skateboard culture enthusiast.

==History==
Earache was founded in 1985 by Digby Pearson who prior to launching the label proper had self-released &#x27;Anglican Scrape Attic&#x27;, a compilation of hardcore punk and early crossover thrash acts which included Hirax, Lipcream and Concrete Sox. The first official Earache release on vinyl in 1987 with catalogue number MOSH 1, was The Accüsed&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Martha Splatterhead&quot;. This was followed by a split LP by the crust/crossover band Concrete Sox and the proto-grind band Heresy. The label&#x27;s first major release of note was MOSH 3, Napalm Death&#x27;s &quot;Scum&quot;. Famously, John Peel was a champion of the band and supported them on BBC Radio 1. The record went on to reach number 7 in the UK indie chart. Following this, Earache released music by many bands from the emerging grindcore and death metal scenes, such as Morbid Angel, Carcass, Entombed, Bolt Thrower and Terrorizer.

Although intrinsically linked with death metal, the label&#x27;s catalogue is varied and also includes Welsh ragga-metal act Dub War, Birmingham&#x27;s industrial metal pioneers Godflesh, Nottingham&#x27;s Pitchshifter, hardcore techno outfit Ultraviolence, Mick Harris&#x27;s industrial/experimental group Scorn, John Zorn-led experimental group Naked City and doom and sludge metal bands Sleep and Acid Bath.

In the early 1990s Columbia Records, seeking to break into metal, signed a deal with Earache. Columbia would license rights and market and distribute them in The Americas, with rights reverting to Earache upon completion of the deal term. It is widely accepted that Columbia failed to deliver the expected sales that they themselves had projected and thus they sought to prematurely terminate the agreement. Barney Greenway of Napalm Death objected to the deal with Columbia (a subsidiary of Sony Music) on the basis that it was &quot;selling out&quot;, although Napalm Death have since released music also distributed by Columbia parent Sony Music Entertainment. The rights to all Columbia-licensed titles have since reverted to Earache, who thereafter have been wholly independent, working with distributors as opposed to licensees.

The label has a number of subsidiary labels, including Wicked World Records, Elitist Records, Sub Bass Records and the short-lived Necrosis Records.

==Modern era==
As with many labels, Earache has transitioned over time from its initial &quot;extreme&quot; output and now focuses primarily on modern, accomplished guitar projects. Rival Sons were the most notable of the modern crop of artists, before signing with Atlantic Records in 2018. Newer signings include Australia&#x27;s Massive, Nottingham&#x27;s Haggard Cat and Lancaster&#x27;s Massive Wagons.
More recent grindcore and death metal signings include Wormrot and Deicide.

Earache also signed the first independent label direct deal with iTunes shortly after the service launched.

Earache currently holds two Guinness World Records. The first is that of the World&#x27;s Shortest Song, currently held by Napalm Death with &quot;You Suffer&quot; at 1.316 seconds long. The second record is the world&#x27;s shortest full music video, a record held by Brutal Truth with their track &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;.

In 2015 Digby Pearson received the Association of Independent Music Pioneer award.

In 2018 tech sitcom &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; featured &quot;You Suffer&quot; repeatedly in one episode. In response the label created a Twitter bot (@NapalmDeathBot) which sends an hourly tweet with the price of bitcoin. They also inserted &quot;You suffer&quot; into the blockchain, a first for a label.

In August 2018 Earache signed trap/rap artist ALIREZA301. Alireza is a metal influenced rapper from Maryland who performs a style of trap/rap which in parts heavily incorporates guitars.

Earache&#x27;s newer rock signings have achieved Top 15 positions in the UK charts, including: a #6 album with The Temperance Movement&#x27;s &quot;A Deeper Cut&quot; (2018), a #8 album with Blackberry Smoke&#x27;s &quot;Find a Light&quot; (2018), a #9 album with Massive Wagons&#x27; &quot;House of Noise&quot; (2020), a #13 album with Rival Sons&#x27; &quot;Hollow Bones&quot; (2016) and a #14 album with Those Damn Crows&#x27; &quot;Point Of No Return&quot; (2020).

To begin the new decade, Earache Records announced a compilation vinyl titled &quot;The New wave of Rock N Roll&quot; featuring a host of new acts.

==Earache Live==
In 2017 Earache were invited to host the first ever stage for heavy music at Glastonbury Festival. &#x27;The Earache Express&#x27; was a recycled London underground tube carriage located in the &#x27;Shangri La&#x27; area of the site. The stage featured performances from Napalm Death, The Dead Kennedys, Ho99o9, Hacktivist, Glen Matlock of The Sex Pistols, Steve Ignorant of Crass and Wormrot amongst others.

Having been well received by Glastonbury Festival, Boomtown (who are affiliated to Glastonbury) invited Earache to curate a stage at their 2018 event which took place in Winchester during August 2018. The stage (named The Earache Factory) was designed around the concept of a disused factory within a run-down part of a futuristic town. It featured artists such as Soulfly, Dead Kennedys and Enter Shikari not to mention a headline set by British upstarts Idles.

In 2019 Earache will be hosting an evening at Camp Bestival in Dorset bringing along Napalm Death, Lawnmower Deth, Diamond Head, Phil Campbell &amp; The Bastard Sons and Nosebleed.

==Criticism==
Over the years, the relationship between the label and some of its former artists have become fraught, and Pearson has made a number of disparaging blog posts about, among others, JS Clayden from Pitchshifter and Barney Greenway of Napalm Death. Greenway responded that Pearson &quot;expects everybody to be subservient&quot;, while Clayden called Pearson &quot;petty and vindictive&quot; and criticized the label for not allowing fans to stream or purchase Pitchshifter&#x27;s albums that were released on Earache. In the documentary &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot;, Scott Carlson from Repulsion accused Earache of not paying the band, adding &quot;I&#x27;m sure they sold way more records than they told us they did.&quot; Former Iron Monkey drummer Justin Greaves accused Earache of refusing to support the band financially in an emergency when during a European tour, singer Johnny Morrow fell sick and needed to return to the UK, which the band couldn&#x27;t afford to cover.

<doc id="1136108" wikidata="Q1768403" url="?curid=1136108" title="Hypostomus plecostomus">
<text>Hypostomus plecostomus, also known as the suckermouth catfish or common pleco, is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the armored catfish family (Loricariidae), named for the longitudinal rows of armor-like scutes that cover the upper parts of the head and body (the lower surface of head and abdomen is naked soft skin). Although the name &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; is often used to refer to common plecostomus sold in aquarium shops, most are actually members of other genera.

Suckermouth catfish are of little or no value as a food fish, although they are at least occasionally consumed over their native range. A demand exists for them, however, as a bottom cleaner in the aquarium trade.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This species&#x27; native range is tropical northeastern South America; it naturally occurs in northeastern Brazil, the Guianas, and Trinidad and Tobago. Confusingly, the name &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; (or &quot;Plecostomus plecostomus&quot;) has sometimes been incorrectly used for several more-or-less similar loricariid catfishes, both in the popular and scientific literature. For example, it has sometimes been suggested that it occurs in southern Central America, but this is an entirely separate species, &quot;Hemiancistrus aspidolepis&quot; (also known under another synonym, &quot;Hypostomus panamensis&quot;).

Some Loricariidae species have been widely introduced to several countries around the world and reported as &quot;H. plecostomus&quot;. It is erroneous, and the concerned species belong to the genus &quot;Pterygoplichthys&quot; (either &quot;P. pardalis&quot;, &quot;P. disjunctivus&quot;, &quot;P. anisitsi&quot; or &quot;P. multiradiatus&quot;). In the United States, a &quot;Pterygoplichthys&quot; species has been introduced to some regions in the South, most likely released by aquarists into the local waters. For example, they are present in a lake in the neighborhood of Hammock Trace Preserve in Melbourne, Florida. In Texas, reproducing populations occur in spring-influenced habitats of the San Antonio River (Bexar County), Comal Springs (Comal County), San Marcos River (Hays County), and San Felipe Creek (Val Verde County), as well as in drainage canals in the Rio Grande Valley and Houston.

The same identification issues have spread in the literature regarding the invasive catfishes in Taiwan, with &quot;H. plecostomus&quot; being one of the numerous names used to designate the species: DNA studies showed the alien fishes were actually &quot;P. pardalis&quot; and &quot;P. disjunctivus&quot; (that hybridise extensively).

&quot;H. plecostomus&quot; prefer to live in water between 72 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (~22.2 to 30 degrees Celsius), with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5.

== Diet ==
&quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food, including newly hatched and baby golden apple snails as well as Malaysian trumpet snails. This omnivorous species also feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.

== Physiology ==
&quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; is one of many species of fish that is able to breathe air. &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; relies on its gills for respiration in normal and slightly hypoxic water, and the less oxygen present in the water, the more frequently it surfaces to breathe air. The air is taken to the stomach where the oxygen is absorbed, and the air can be kept in the stomach to increase buoyancy, which may help it to feed on vegetation.

== In the aquarium ==
&quot;H. plecostomus&quot; is one of a number of species commonly referred to as &quot;plecostomus&quot; or &quot;common pleco&quot; by aquarists. These fish are sold when they are young and small, but in the wild, they can grow to be a maximum size of . In captivity, however, a full-grown &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; only reaches 15 inches (38 cm) on average, which could be explained by the subpar oxygen levels in most home aquaria and other practices of bad fish husbandry. In the aquarium trade, this dark-colored, bottom-feeding, nocturnal catfish is often purchased for its ability to clean algae from fish tanks but also contributes a lot of waste to the nitrogen cycle. They are difficult for other fish to harass, both due to the semi-aggressive nature of the fish as well as its thick armor.

== Invasive species ==
In Bangladesh, the species, among some other suckermouth catfishes has become invasive. The government is currently on its way to impose a ban on the farming, hatchling production, breeding, marketing and trading of the fish. It has also raised serious concern in India, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. In September 2024, the Selangor state government in Malaysia allocated RM50,000 (approximately US$ 11,533) as an incentive to capture 50,000 kg of the fish in Langat River.

In the Philippines, two very similar species, &quot;Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus&quot; and &quot;Pterygoplichthys pardalis&quot;, were initially misidentified as &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; due to them sharing the local common names of &quot;janitor fish&quot; and &quot;pleco&quot;. They were introduced in the 1970s via the aquarium trade and has since become highly invasive to Laguna de Bay (including tributaries like the Marikina River) and the Agusan Marsh.

== Naming ==
=== Common names ===
A large variety of common names is used to describe &quot;H. plecostomus&quot;, where plecostomus and the shortened &quot;pleco&quot; are interchangeable in all common names. The names include:
* algae sucker/eater
* pez diablo (devil fish)
* pleco
* water old lady (vieja del agua)
* janitor fish
* municipal fish – &#x27;ikan bandaraya&#x27; in Malay
* suckermouth catfish
* sweeper fish – &#x27;ikan sapu sapu&#x27; in Indonesian
* crocodile fish (not to be confused with &quot;Papilloculiceps longiceps&quot;, which is originally known as the crocodile fish or tentacled flathead)

=== Taxonomy ===
The species&#x27; scientific name, &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot;, is derived from the Greek word &quot;hypo&quot; (υπό, meaning &quot;under&quot;), the Greek word &quot;stoma&quot; (στόμα, meaning &quot;mouth&quot;), and the Latin word &quot;pleco&quot; (meaning &quot;pleated&quot;).

Many of the common names used to identify &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; are also used for other species, which augments the confusion surrounding &quot;H. plecostomus&quot; and other Loricariidae such as &quot;H. punctatus&quot;, &quot;Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus&quot; and &quot;P. pardalis&quot;. In 2012, Weber, Covain, and Fisch-Muller showed the type series of Carl Linnaeus was heterogenous and comprised two species: &quot;H. plecostomus&quot; (for which the authors designate a lectotype) and &quot;H. watwata&quot;.

<text>An autorack, also known as an auto carrier (also car transporter outside the US), is a specialized piece of railroad rolling stock used to transport automobiles and light trucks. Autoracks are used to transport new vehicles from factories to automotive distributors, and to transport passengers&#x27; vehicles in car shuttles and motorail services, such as Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Auto Train&quot; route.

==History==
In the early 20th century, when automobiles were still new technology, their production levels were low enough that they could be shipped in sufficient quantities in boxcars. Two to four automobiles would usually fit into one boxcar. But as the automobile industry grew in size, railroads found that they needed to modify the boxcars for more efficient loading. Some modifications included longer boxcars, larger sliding double side doors located near one end of the boxcar, or doors located on the boxcar ends.

These modifications helped, but the demand for new automobiles outpaced the railroads&#x27; abilities to build and modify boxcars in which to ship them. In 1923, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad experimented with modifying a group of wood-frame flat cars to increase their capacity by adding collapsible frames to allow for double-deck operation. The concept was not perfected and therefore failed to gain acceptance. In the 1940s and 1950s, some railroads experimented with automobile-loading assemblies that would lift one or more automobiles above others within a boxcar. The success of these assemblies was limited due to their special use and specific size; it proved uneconomical to maintain a fleet of these assemblies that could only be loaded into boxcars from the ends of the cars.

By this time, in the United States, most circuses still traveled by rail. Circuses were major haulers of wheeled vehicles, carrying all of their vehicles on flat cars, usually behind their own passenger cars or in separate sections of their trains; basically, one train would haul the performers and employees while a second train would haul the vehicles and freight. The circus solution to loading vehicles was to use a string of flatcars. A temporary ramp was placed at the end of the flatcars and temporary bridge plates spanned the gaps between adjacent flatcars; the road vehicles were driven or towed up onto one car and then driven or towed down the train. This type of vehicle loading became known as &quot;circus style&quot; due to its frequent use by circuses.

In the 1950s, most railroads took the cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even up to six automobiles onto one flat car left a large amount of space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added to the ends of the flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.

In the mid-1950s, in Germany, Volkswagen Beetle production was increasing beyond the capacity of highway trucks (autocarriers). Volkswagen engineers worked with German railroads to design a railroad car that was basically an extra long version of a vehicle hauling trailer. The design they came up with was able to carry 10 vehicles on one car. VW&#x27;s two-level flatcar design effectively became the first autorack, entering service circa 1954.

Also in 1954, Evans Products, a manufacturer of loading racks for carrying automobiles in conventional boxcars, developed a bi-level Auto-Loader superstructure with an elevating top deck capable of carrying six cars or light trucks on a typical flatcar. Two prototype units were constructed and mounted on conventional flat cars for field testing. NYC 500085 carried a semi-streamlined rack, while UP 5800 had a more utilitarian rack mounted. Neither design went into commercial production.

In late 1957, Canadian National (CN) introduced an innovative group of bi-level auto carriers. These CN cars were similar to conventional boxcars, except they had a second floor and doors at both ends of the car instead of the usual side doors. They were huge by the standards of the time; the cars were long and could carry eight vehicles. These cars were a big success and helped lead to the development of today&#x27;s enclosed auto racks.

In 1959, when flat cars capable of carrying two highway trailers in trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC), or &quot;piggyback&quot; service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by rail loaded on highway auto-carrier trailers. Eight to ten autos could be carried per flat car in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB&amp;Q, C&amp;NW, CRIP, D&amp;H, D&amp;RGW, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L&amp;N, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the highway trailer body without the wheel assembly, developed a Flexi-Van automobile carrier rack.

Seeking a more efficient method, in February 1959 the Saint Louis-San Francisco Railroad (SL-SF, or Frisco) designed and built a prototype bi-level rack mounted on flat car SL-SF 95844. Satisfied that the basic concept was sound, the railroad contracted with Pullman-Standard to design and construct a full-size tri-level prototype. The result that rolled out of the Pullman plant on January 29, 1960, was SLSF 3000, an tri-level car capable of carrying 12 automobiles. When testing proved the car satisfactory the Frisco ordered 130 production cars, SL-SF 3001–3130, delivered by Pullman that August and September.

In 1960, the Frisco was not the only railroad experimenting with racks mounted on flat cars to carry automobiles. In January the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) constructed a prototype trilevel rack mounted on flat ATSF 90082. Santa Fe&#x27;s first production auto racks were trilevel Auto-Veyor units supplied by Dana-Spicer and Whitehead &amp; Kales later in the year, both mounted on General American-built G85 cars. The Southern Pacific actually took delivery of the first Whitehead &amp; Kales Auto-Pack tri-level racks in April, mounting them on General American-built Clejan and G85 cars. The slightly longer racks could carry 12 full size or 18 compact autos per car. Several other railroads quickly ordered their own auto racks from Dana and W&amp;K or from American Car &amp; Foundry, Darby Corporation, Evans Products, Paragon Bridge &amp; Steel, or Thrall Car Manufacturing. The Santa Fe and Frisco also built some of their autoracks in their own car shops.

Curiously, in 1961 a German-built three-unit, articulated bilevel autorack was imported into the United States to demonstrate the German design to U.S. railroads. North American Car Corporation handled promotion of the car, which was marked NIFX 1200. The car rode on four single-axle trucks and was tested by the B&amp;O, but no sales resulted.

Starting in this early period, most autoracks were mounted on flat cars leased from a leasing company, such as Trailer Train (see below), North American Car (NIFX marks), Merchants Despatch (MDAX marks), American Refrigerator Transit (MPFX marks), or Pullman&#x27;s Transport Leasing Division (TLCX marks), but many roads also operated cars mounted on their own flat cars. Railroads known to have done so include ATSF, CN, CP, CR, CRR, D&amp;RGW, FEC, GN, GTW, KCS, L&amp;N, Monon, MP, N&amp;W, RI, SCL, SLSF, SOO, Southern, SP, SSW, UP, WM, and WP.

==Transporting new automobiles==
During the early 1960s, specially built auto carriers rapidly took over rail transportation of newly completed automobiles in North America. They carried more vehicles in the same space and were easier to load and unload than the boxcars formerly used. Ever-larger auto carriers and specialized terminals were developed by Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W) and other carriers. Autoracks were built in three-level configurations carrying automobiles, and with two-levels for vans and light trucks.

Autorack and flat car length quickly grew to and then to increase their loading capacity even further. This made them about as long as the average railroad passenger car of the time; if the cars were much longer, they would not be able to operate in interchange service due to clearance on curves. Yet, the railroads could still do better.

A major problem left to solve was that the new autorack cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still gain access to the automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead &amp; Kales, Ford, N&amp;W and DT&amp;I jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single-axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.

The first production fully enclosed racks were delivered in late 1974 and early 1975. The Whitehead &amp; Kales tri-level design, renamed Safe-Pak, was delivered to ATSF, CP, CRR, FEC, NW, SCL, SSW, UP, and WP, all of them riding on railroad-owned flats. Portec&#x27;s RailPac design, developed in cooperation with Chrysler, was placed into service by ATSF, C&amp;O, C&amp;NW, D&amp;RGW, GTW, N&amp;W, RF&amp;P, SLSF, SP, UP and several other roads, with most riding on leased Trailer Train flats. These two designs were refined during the late 1970s and by 1980 fully enclosed tri-levels accounted for roughly a third of the in-service fleet, however fully enclosed bi-levels lagged far behind.

Roofs were not added to all autoracks until the mid-1980s, as it took time for railroads with low overhead clearance routes to modify their bridge and tunnel clearances to accept them. Consequently, some roofless and even open tri-levels and bi-levels remained in service into the mid-to-late 1980s.

The number of manufacturers offering autoracks declined during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Several firms simply exited the field, including AC&amp;F, Evans, Dana, and Darby, while others were acquired by other builders. Pullman, after supplying the very first production tri-level autoracks to the Frisco, abandoned the field to concentrate on the flat cars that autoracks were mounted on, only to return briefly in 1976–1977 to build a few tri-levels for the B&amp;O and Cotton Belt (SSW). Pacific Car &amp; Foundry briefly produced a few racks at about the same time, as did Thrall. Whitehead &amp; Kales, one of two dominant producers since the late 1960s, was acquired by Thrall in 1981. Paragon, the other leading rack-builder, was purchased by Portec in the early 1970s, which was in turn acquired by Thrall in 1985. Paragon&#x27;s autorack designs were sold to Greenville Steel Car, also in 1985, which was itself acquired by Trinity Industries in 1986. Thrall itself was eventually acquired by Trinity as well in 2001. Currently autoracks are produced by TrinityRail, Greenbrier, Johnstown America, National Steel Car, and the Union Pacific Railroad.

===Vert-A-Pac and Stac-Pac===

Both railroads and automakers wanted to eliminate theft and damage from vandalism and weather, thus reducing shipping costs. They also wanted to increase the number of vehicles carried per rail car for the same reason. Toward that end, in 1968 General Motors and the Southern Pacific Railroad jointly began work on development of a radical new rail car designed to carry the Chevrolet Vega, a new compact car being developed by GM. Known as Vert-A-Pac, the rail cars would hold 30 Vegas in a vertical, nose-down position, versus 18 in normal tri-level autoracks. Each Vega was fitted with four removable, cast-steel sockets inserted into the undercarriage that locked into the hooks on the bottom-hinged doors that made up the car side.

The prototype car, SP 618000 was turned out in December 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas would not shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet&#x27;s goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready to drive to the dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45-degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.

The first production Vert-A-Pacs entered service in April 1970; the last ones entered service in January 1973. Besides Southern Pacific, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, Burlington Northern, Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western, Florida East Coast, Frisco, Illinois Central Gulf, Louisville &amp; Nashville, Milwaukee Road, Missouri Pacific, Penn Central (under Merchants Despatch Transportation), Rock Island, Seaboard Coast Line, and Southern Railway operated Vert-A-Pacs. All were withdrawn from service at the end of the 1977 Vega model year and were reracked with conventional tri-level racks.

Another joint General Motors-Southern Pacific automobile rail car was the Stac-Pac. It was designed to carry 12 high-end Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac models in four removable fully enclosed tri-level containers per flat car. The first production Stac-Pac cars entered service in October 1971. Besides SP and its Cotton Belt subsidiary (SSW), Stac-Pac flat cars were contributed to the pool by the Santa Fe and Trailer Train, with the containers being supplied by ATSF, BN, D&amp;RGW, FEC, MILW, PC (MDT), RI, Southern Railway, SP, Cotton Belt Route, Union Pacific, and by General Motors itself. All of the cars and containers were withdrawn from service at the end of the 1976 model year.

===Trailer Train Company===
Although railroads were just beginning to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads&#x27; financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the flat cars from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed on those flat cars. Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train on the flat car portion of the car and the railroad&#x27;s logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.

This arrangement worked so well that nearly every autorack operating in the US was owned by a railroad, with only a few exceptions. Trailer Train became TTX Company in 1991; since then many railroads have themselves purchased the flat cars on which the racks were installed and TTX has itself expanded into purchasing and leasing out other railroad rolling stock. The development of enclosed autoracks also helped make several other innovative services work well.

===New designs and current usage===


Railroads of today are still grappling with the problem of loading more and larger vehicles onto autoracks. One popular solution is to create a double-length car that is articulated over a single middle truck so that each half of the car is about the same length as a conventional autorack. These cars, which can be seen in operation on many of the railroads of the western US (but also seen occasionally in the Great Lakes and Southern Ontario), are brand named &quot;AutoMax&quot; cars. These cars, built by Gunderson (a subsidiary of The Greenbrier Companies) measure long and tall; they feature adjustable interior decks to carry up to 22 light trucks and minivans. Thrall produced a competing articulated two-unit design.

For greater flexibility and to improve car utilization, single-unit autoracks are being built that allow the number of loading levels, or decks, to be easily changed between bilevel (two) and trilevel (three), depending on which is in demand at the time. Greenbrier calls their version of this multilevel concept the &quot;Multi-Max&quot;, while the Union Pacific Railroad builds their own version, called the &quot;AutoFlex&quot;.

The railroads have become the primary long-distance transporter of completed automobiles. Using the enclosed tri-level autoracks, they are able to provide lower costs as well as greater protection from in-transit damage (such as that which may occur due to weather and traffic conditions on unenclosed truck semi-trailers). When the railroad companies went from the open autoracks to the enclosed, they were able to reduce freight damage claims. The enclosed rail cars prevented the autos from getting damaged from falling or thrown rocks, bullets and other forms of vandalism. They also stopped the theft of autos and parts from autos and kept hobos from living in the automobiles.

==Combining autoracks and passenger cars==

===Australia===
In March 1972 the Western Australian Government Railways introduced the first motorail services in Australia on services from Perth to Albany, Bunbury, Geraldton and Mullewa. In August 1972 the Victorian Railways introduced a motorail on &quot;The Vinelander&quot; between Melbourne and Mildura. In March 1973 the Public Transport Commission introduced a motorail service on the &quot;Gold Coast Motorail&quot; between Sydney and Murwillumbah. In July 1973 a motorail service was introduced on the &quot;Southern Aurora&quot; between Sydney and Melbourne. 

In October 1976 a motorail service was introduced on the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; and &quot;Trans-Australian&quot; between Port Pirie and Perth. In October 1988 it was extended to operate on the service throughout to Sydney. The motorail service was curtailed to operate between Adelaide and Perth in November 2015. In November 1978, a motorail service was introduced on &quot;The Overland&quot; between Adelaide and Melbourne.

In December 1980 a motorail service was introduced by Australian National on &quot;The Ghan&quot; between Adelaide and Alice Springs. In April 1986, the first motorail service in Queensland was introduced by Queensland Rail on &quot;The Queenslander&quot; between Brisbane and Cairns. In June 1986 a motorail service was introduced on the &quot;Brisbane Limited&quot; between Sydney and Brisbane. In October 1987 the State Rail Authority introduced a motorail service on the &quot;Intercapital Daylight&quot; between Sydney and Melbourne. 

In February 1992, Queensland Rail introduced motorail services on &quot;The Sunlander&quot; between Brisbane and Cairns and in February 1993 the &quot;Spirit of the Outback&quot; between Brisbane and Longreach.

===United States===
A rail transport service where passengers can take their automobile along with them on their journey is known as an &quot;Auto Train&quot; in North America and as a &quot;Motorail&quot; in Australia and Europe. Passengers are carried in normal passenger cars or in sleeping cars on longer journeys, while their vehicles are loaded into autoracks, car carriers, or flatcars.

==== Auto-Train Corporation ====
On December 6, 1971, Auto-Train Corporation introduced a new and innovative rail transportation service for both passengers and their automobiles in the United States, operating scheduled service between Lorton, Virginia (near Washington DC) and Sanford, Florida, near Orlando.

The Auto Train offered an alternative to motorists who would otherwise have to drive their automobiles the distance along the East Coast of the United States. For vacationers with destinations at one or more of the many popular tourist attractions of Florida, the Auto Train service offered two advantages:
# avoid the long automobile ride on busy Interstate 95 in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida
# have the convenience of using their own automobile upon arrival.

From the beginning in 1971, the same year Amtrak began service on purely passenger routes in the United States, a key feature of Auto-Train&#x27;s new service was the use of autoracks, which were former Canadian National transcontinental bi-level, enclosed autorack boxcars. These were augmented by new tri-level auto-racks built by Southern Iron &amp; Equipment in 1976.

The privately owned service became very popular, but after 10 years of operation, and some costly attempts to expand the service elsewhere, such as a schedule between Florida and Chicago, Illinois, Auto-Train Corporation entered bankruptcy, and service ended in April 1981.
====Amtrak&#x27;s Auto Train====
Auto Train service between Virginia and Florida was resumed by Amtrak in 1983. Amtrak, a federally chartered corporation which operates most intercity passenger trains in the United States, continued to use Auto-Train&#x27;s autoracks as an important portion of its service. These were supplemented with new bilevels built by Johnstown America in 2004 and 2005.

In current operation of Amtrak&#x27;s Auto Train, there are two trains in operation simultaneously. The autoracks normally run on the rear of Auto Train consists, which stretch over a three quarters of a mile, and are a familiar sight on CSX tracks on the east coast.

====Whittier Shuttle====
In the mid-1960s, the Alaska Railroad began offering a vehicle shuttle service utilizing standard flat cars and passenger cars. Dubbed the &quot;Whittier Shuttle,&quot; it operated in Alaska through the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel under Maynard Mountain between a stop just off the Seward Highway near the former town of Portage and the small port town of Whittier, Alaska, which was also a port of call for the Alaska Marine Highway ferry system.

As traffic to Whittier increased, the shuttle became insufficient, leading to a project to convert the existing railroad tunnel into a single-lane combination highway and railway tunnel which was opened to traffic on June 7, 2000. At a length of , it is the second-longest highway tunnel and the longest combined rail and highway tunnel in North America.

<doc id="1136117" wikidata="Q5126477" url="?curid=1136117" title="Clarence Dock, Liverpool">
<text>Clarence Dock was a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. Situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall, it was connected to Trafalgar Dock.

==History==
Designed by Jesse Hartley, the dock opened on 16 September 1830. Clarence Dock was named after William, Duke of Clarence, who became William IV.

It was built as a self-contained steamship dock facility. This was to avoid the risk of fire to wooden-hulled sailing vessels then using the other docks.

The dock was the principal berth for the Irish ferry ships. During the Irish famine in the 1840s over 1.3 million Irish people travelled through the dock. After many weeks or months, many took a ship to America from Waterloo Dock, there being fewer direct sailings to America from Ireland at this time. However many thousands made their home in Liverpool. Others moved to London and other British towns and cities in search of work.

The dock closed in 1928, and in 1929 was filled in when the site was redeveloped as power station.

=== Clarence Dock power station ===
Clarence Dock power station was constructed for Liverpool Corporation in 1931 to be an integral part of the local electricity grid system supplying electricity throughout Liverpool. The station plant comprised a low pressure station (No. 1) and a later high pressure station (No. 2) both based on coal-fired, water tube boilers and steam turbine driven alternators.

The plant in the low pressure station (installed 1931–32) comprised:

Boilers (all coal-fired)

* 4 × 160,000 pounds per hour (20.16 kg/s) of steam at 450 psi and 775 °F (31.0 bar and 413 °C)
* 4 × 200,000 lb/hr (25.20 kg/s) of steam at 450 psi and 775 °F (31.0 bar and 413 °C)

Turbo-alternators

* 2 × 51.25 MW twin cylinder Metropolitan-Vickers, 1,500 rpm, 7,250 kV, 3-phase, 50 Hz.

The plant in the high pressure station (installed 1937–53) comprised:

Boilers (all initially coal-fired, converted to oil-firing in the 1960s)

* 6 × 200,000 lb/hr (25.25 kg/s) of steam at 630 psi and 825 °F (43.45 bar and 441 °C)
* 1 × 250,000 lb/hr (31.5 kg/s) of steam at above conditions
* 5 × 350,000 lb/hr (44.1 kg/s) of steam at above conditions

Turbo-alternators

* 5 × 53.5 MW Metropolitan-Vickers, 1,500 rpm, 33 kV, 3-phase, 50 Hz.

The generating capacity, electricity output and thermal efficiency of the stations were as shown in the tables.


By 1972 the No. 1 station had been decommissioned and the No. 2 station converted to oil firing. The No. 2 station was decommissioned in the early 1980s.

The three large chimneys of the Clarence Dock Power Station were a familiar local landmark, known as the &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, until the power station was demolished in 1994.

==Present==

The two Clarence Graving Docks are still extant and accessible via what remains of Trafalgar Dock. On 17 July 2006, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Face to Face Tour supporting their album Face to Face.

As part of the Liverpool Waters development, Clarence Dock will become one of the clusters of tall buildings. It was one of the two clusters of tall high-rise buildings which have been agreed between Peel Holdings and English Heritage.

In 2004 it was proposed that a 60,000 seater stadium for Everton FC be built at Kings Dock by the Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour Company and the NWDA. This would have included a rapid rail service to be financed by the NWDA. Nothing became of this. However in 2016 Northern docks emerged as one of two possible new locations for a new ground for Everton.

<text>Crø̈ønchy Stars was a breakfast cereal by Post Cereal of North America. The cereal was released in 1988, and discontinued about a year later, though it made a brief return in 1992. The box featured the Swedish Chef from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, who described the cereal as &quot;cinnamonnamony&quot;. The product&#x27;s name is likely a pseudo-phonetic rendition of how the Chef would pronounce &quot;crunchy.&quot; The back of the box featured ridiculous, and sometimes unsolvable, games and puzzles, including a memory-type card game on every box.

Most of the cereal&#x27;s labeling and promotional material used the idiosyncratic spelling &quot;Swed̈ish Chef&quot;, with an umlaut over the letter &quot;d&quot;. This is an instance of an umlaut being unconventionally used over a consonant, as with &quot;Spın̈al Tap&quot;.

Nora Singh, a recording studio assistant working with Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, is shown eating a bowl of Cröonchy Stars cereal in episode six of the 2023 Disney+ series &quot;The Muppets Mayhem&quot;, with an original box for the cereal present on the table.

<doc id="1136134" wikidata="Q1166049" url="?curid=1136134" title="Square rig">
<text>Square rig is a generic type of sail and rigging arrangement in which the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal spars which are perpendicular, or , to the keel of the vessel and to the masts. These spars are called &quot;yards&quot; and their tips, outside the lifts, are called the &quot;yardarms.&quot; A ship mainly rigged so is called a square-rigger.

In &#x27;Jackspeak&#x27; (Royal Navy slang) it also refers to the dress uniform of Junior Ratings.

== History ==

Single sail square rigs were used by the ancient Egyptians, the Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Celts. Later the Scandinavians, the Germanic peoples, and the Slavs adopted the single square-rigged sail, with it becoming one of the defining characteristics of the classic “Viking” ships.

<doc id="1136161" wikidata="Q912636" url="?curid=1136161" title="Brian Maisonneuve">
<text>Brian Maisonneuve (born June 28, 1973) is an American retired soccer player and current coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes. He spent his entire professional career as a defensive midfielder with the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer. He was a member of the U.S. soccer teams at both the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 1998 FIFA World Cup, earning a total of thirteen caps with the U.S. national team.

==Youth and college==
Maisonneuve was born in Warren, Michigan. He played for the Carpathia Kickers in Metro Detroit as a child and teen. He played his high school soccer at De La Salle Collegiate High School of Warren, Michigan. He played college soccer at Indiana University from 1991 to 1994, winning the Hermann Trophy his senior season, as well as finishing his career as the Big Ten&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer with 44, and helping Indiana to the NCAA Championship game, losing 1–2 to Virginia.

==Club career==
Maisonneuve was allocated to the Columbus Crew for the 1996 MLS season, becoming one of two players without any pro experience on the league&#x27;s initial allocation list; the other was Damian Silvera. Maisonneuve would quickly earn a starting spot with the Crew, and would hold on to it for the next 8 years. He started 83 games for the Crew between 1996 and 1999.

Before the 2000 season, he suffered a series of devastating ankle injuries, forcing him to sit out the season and threatening his career. Maisonneuve returned in 2001, however, and slotted right back into his starting role. He would remain there for the next three years, before finally losing his spot when the Crew acquired Simon Elliott prior to the 2004 season; Maisonneuve would go on to play only nine games in 2004.

By Major League Soccer&#x27;s ninth year, Maisonneuve was one of only two players to have played for a single club throughout that period, and when he retired after the season, he left Cobi Jones as the lone player with that distinction. Maisonneuve scored 23 goals and 37 assists in his pro career.

==International career==
After graduating from Indiana University, Maisonneuve spent 1995 training with the U.S. Olympic Team; he later played in the 1996 Summer Olympics. During his professional career, Maisonneuve was a fringe player for the United States national team, totalling just 13 caps with the team. Despite his limited playing time, Maisonneuve did play all three of the United States&#x27; games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement in 2004, Maisonneuve joined the United States U-17 team as an assistant coach, spending four years there. In 2008, he joined the Louisville Cardinals men&#x27;s soccer team coaching staff as an assistant coach. He would stay with the team for two years, during which time they had a 24–11–4 record. In 2010 Maisonneuve joined the Indiana Hoosiers men&#x27;s soccer team coaching staff as an assistant coach. During his tenure, he helped the team to an NCAA Division I Championship in 2012, a regular season championship in 2010, a Big Ten Tournament Championship in 2013, and an overall record of 102–42–34. On April 23, 2018, Maisonneuve was announced as the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes men&#x27;s soccer team.

<doc id="1136163" wikidata="Q4530751" url="?curid=1136163" title="Elvis Meets Nixon">
<text>Elvis Meets Nixon is a 1997 Canadian-American mockumentary film directed by Allan Arkush and starring Rick Peters, Bob Gunton, and Alyson Court. It is an embellished account of the true story of American singer Elvis Presley meeting President Richard Nixon on December 21, 1970.

== Plot ==
Elvis Presley, bored with his confined existence in Graceland, leaves his home on his own for the first time since he was 21. He winds up in California and is convinced by an Anti-war activist that he is responsible for the counterculture through his influence on The Beatles. This prompts Elvis to write a letter to President Nixon asking to be made a &quot;Federal Agent at Large&quot; for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. No such position actually exists, but Nixon, wanting desperately to win over the youth of America, which he views as hating him, decides to meet with Elvis in an attempt to improve his image with the &quot;kids&quot;.

==Cast==
==Background==
On December 19, 1970, Presley was confronted by his wife, Priscilla, and his father, Vernon, over his spending habits. Angered by their confrontation, Presley left Graceland and made his way to the airport, boarding a flight to Washington D.C. After checking in at the Hotel Washington, Presley flew to Los Angeles to meet his friend, Jerry Schilling.

Due to an allergic reaction Presley experienced from a medication for an eye infection, aggravated by chocolate that he ate on the plane, a rash had developed on his face and neck. After seeing a doctor and getting some sleep, Presley informed Schilling that he wanted to return to Washington D.C., and arranged for another friend, Sonny West, to meet them. On the flight Presley met California senator George Murphy. Presley showed an interest in acquiring a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, and Murphy suggested that Presley write to President Nixon offering his services to help combat illicit drug use. Presley wrote a letter on the plane and hand delivered it to the White House at 6:30 am on December 21.

A few hours later Presley visited the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs headquarters in Washington D.C., meeting with Deputy Director John Finlator. He was unsuccessful in persuading Finlator to give him a BNDD badge. Schilling received a call at the hotel from Egil Krogh, President Nixon&#x27;s deputy counsel, to arrange a meeting between Presley and Nixon. After picking up Schilling and West from the hotel, Presley made his way to the White House. All three met with Nixon and received gifts. Presley persuaded Nixon to give him a BNDD badge, and after an official photograph was taken, the trio left, with Presley returning to Graceland the following day.

On December 30, Presley returned to Washington D.C., with a few friends to visit the National Sheriffs Association head office. The next day they were given a tour of FBI headquarters, where Presley offered his services as an undercover agent. Despite never getting to meet FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, Presley did receive a letter from him on January 4, 1971, acknowledging his offer of assistance.

<doc id="1136165" wikidata="Q16986288" url="?curid=1136165" title="Vail Resorts">
<text>Vail Resorts, Inc. is an American mountain resort company headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado. The company is divided into three divisions. The mountain segment owns and operates 42 mountain resorts in four countries. Vail Resorts Hospitality owns or manages hotels, lodging, condominiums, and golf courses, and the Vail Resorts Development Company oversees property development and real estate holdings.

==History==
Vail Resorts was founded as Vail Associates Ltd. by Pete Seibert and Earl Eaton in the early 1960s. Eaton, a lifelong resident, led Siebert (a former WWII 10th Mountain Division ski trooper) to the area in March 1957. They both became ski patrol guides at Aspen, Colorado, when they shared their dream of finding the &quot;next great ski mountain.&quot; Siebert set off to secure financing, and Eaton engineered the early lifts. Their Vail ski resort opened in 1962. George N. Gillett Jr. purchased Vail Associates in 1985. Vail Associates changed its name to Vail Resorts and went public in 1997 after Gillett Holdings went bankrupt. Apollo Management, headed by Leon Black, bought the company out of bankruptcy and took Vail Resorts public, controlling Vail Resorts until 2003, when Apollo divested itself of controlling interest. The skating rink at Beaver Creek, Colorado, was named the Black Family Skating Rink after Leon Black.

Rob Katz, a former executive at Apollo, ran Vail Resorts as CEO until November 2021, when he was appointed executive chairperson of the board. Kirsten Lynch, the company&#x27;s former chief marketing officer, then took over as CEO.

In June 2024, Vail Resorts reported lower-than-expected revenue during the February-April quarter due to a significantly warmer-than-anticipated winter across western North American resorts, with snowfall 28% lower than average. The company generated $1.28 billion in revenue during the quarter despite the stabilizing effect of its Epic Pass program, which allows customers to purchase a season pass for its North American resorts at a significant upfront cost. However, Vail&#x27;s stock price has declined by 50% since its October 2021 peak of $360. While this past winter was one of the warmest on record for the company, concerns exist that future winters may even be warmer.

==Criticism==
Some of Vail Resort&#x27;s acquisitions have fueled anger among local residents. Locals complain that the Vail&#x27;s pass structure caters to wealthy international pass holders and reduces access to nearby residents; additionally, residents have seen their cost-of-living increase following Vail&#x27;s takeovers.

==RockResorts==
In 2001, Vail Resorts acquired the luxury hotel chain RockResorts, contributing substantially to its brand recognition. RockResorts was named after its original owners, the Rockefeller Family. As of January 2017, the properties include:

==Subsidiaries and affiliates==
All of the company&#x27;s retail operations are run by a smaller company, [Vail Resorts Retail, VRR], of which Vail owns 70%. The owners of the other 30% are the Gart Brothers, specifically Tom Gart, Ken Gart, and John Gart. The Gart family has been in the sporting goods business for three generations and was the former owner of Gart Sports, a large chain of sporting goods stores in the western US. Gart Sports was sold by the Gart family in the 1990s and then recently sold again to Sports Authority, which discontinued the use of the Gart Sports name in 2006. In 2010, Vail completed the buyout of the Specialty Sports Venture brand and is now the 100% owner of all SSV operations. In addition to all of the ski shops in the Vail Resorts portfolio of ski areas, the SSV chain of stores includes Bicycle Village in Denver, Colorado Ski &amp; Golf, Boulder Ski Deals, Aspen Sports, Telluride Sports, and Mountain Sports Outlet in Summit County and Glenwood Springs and many others. SSV is reportedly the largest Trek bicycle dealer in the world.

Vail Resorts also owns just over 50% of Slifer Smith and Frampton (SSF), the largest real estate brokerage company in the Vail region, controlling over 70% of the real estate transactions in the market. Slifer, Smith, and Frampton were called Slifer, Smith, and Frampton/Vail Associates Real Estate, but they dropped the &quot;Vail Associates&quot; name in 2003. The founders of SSF are Rod Slifer, a former ski instructor who was recently the mayor of the Town of Vail, and Mark Smith, a real estate broker/turned developer who currently also runs East West Partners with Harry Frampton, who was the former President of Vail Associates and currently owns East West Partners. East West Partners has built most of the large buildings that make up the Beaver Creek Village, including the Marketplace Building, Village Hall, and One Beaver Creek. This is separate from East West Resorts, a separate property management group.

Vail Resorts Development Company (VRDC) is the wholly-owned real estate development company that Vail Resorts uses to develop all of its company-owned real estate, other than the projects East West Partners develops. VRDC developed Bachelor&#x27;s Gulch, one of the business&#x27;s most upscale ski-in/ski-out resorts, with its own Ritz Carlton and just over 100 slopeside mansions. President Gerald Ford kept his ski house between Beaver Creek and Bachelor&#x27;s Gulch in the Strawberry Park section of Beaver Creek. Arrowhead is the third &quot;peak&quot; in the heavily promoted &quot;village to village ski experience&quot; in which you can ski from Beaver Creek to Bachelor&#x27;s Gulch to Arrowhead and back again. Arrowhead was a separate ski area unrelated to Beaver Creek for years before Vail Associates finally bought them in the early 1990s. VRDC also developed the &quot;club&quot; division of Vail Resorts, including the Beaver Creek Club, the Arrowhead Alpine Club, and the Game Creek Club (in Vail). VRDC also developed Red Sky Ranch in Wolcott (approximate west of Beaver Creek), which includes two golf courses and many million dollar golf course homes. These clubs are now operated by the &quot;Mountain Division&quot; of Vail Resorts.

==List of resorts==

Vail Resorts operates 42 ski resorts in the United States, Canada, Australia and Switzerland including, notably, the Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone, and Crested Butte ski areas in Colorado, and Northstar California, Kirkwood Mountain Resort, and Heavenly Mountain Resort on the California-Nevada border. In British Columbia, Canada, they also acquired the largest ski resort in North America: Whistler Blackcomb. Vail Resorts offers a variety of multi-resort season passes under the Epic Pass program. The Epic Pass also has partnerships that allow access to several other resorts in the US, Canada, Japan, France, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. Vail Resorts acquired the Grand Teton Lodge Company within the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in 1999. The GTLC properties include the Jenny Lake Lodge, Jackson Lake Lodge, and Colter Bay Village.

<text>The Texas Travesty is a student-produced satirical newspaper created and produced at the University of Texas at Austin.

The &quot;Travesty&quot; began in 1997 as an independent, online-only publication by the Butler brothers: Kevin Butler (a former editorial columnist for &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;) and Brad Butler. Within a year, the publication successfully appealed for inclusion within Texas Student Media (TSM, officially named Texas Student Publications), an auxiliary enterprise of the university which publishes &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; and produces KVRX and TSTV.

The staff produces six issues each school year, three each long semester. According to the TSM itself, the &quot;Travesty&quot; currently has a print distribution of roughly 25,000 copies, in addition to thousands of online readers. The &quot;Travesty&quot; is supported by advertising revenue. As a publication within TSM, the paper shares some revenue and expenses with the general TSM organization. The editor-in-chief holds a non-voting position on the TSM board of directors.

Several of the &quot;Travesty&quot;″s writers and editors went on to publish &quot;That Other Paper&quot;, a once-popular but now-defunct alternative weekly in Austin, Texas.

<doc id="1136182" wikidata="Q525421" url="?curid=1136182" title="The Secret Garden (1993 film)">
<text>The Secret Garden is a 1993 fantasy drama film directed by Agnieszka Holland, executive-produced by Francis Ford Coppola and distributed by Warner Bros. under their Family Entertainment imprint. Starring Kate Maberly, Heydon Prowse, Andrew Knott and Maggie Smith, the film&#x27;s screenplay was written by Caroline Thompson, based on the 1911 novel of the same name by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It also marked the film debuts for Maberly, Prowse and Knott. The novel was previously adapted in 1919 and 1949.

Set in the Yorkshire Moors in Northern England, Yorkshire&#x27;s Allerton Castle was used for most of the exterior shots of Misselthwaite Manor (the primary location of the entire story), as well as the interior shots. The film was critically and commercially successful, grossing around $40 million worldwide. Dame Maggie Smith was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and young lead actress Kate Maberly received a &quot;Special Achievement Award For Outstanding Performance&quot; at the 1994 London Critics Circle Film Awards. At the 1993 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, the film&#x27;s composer, Zbigniew Preisner, won &quot;Best Music&quot; for the film&#x27;s lush, impressive score. The film also features a song performed by Linda Ronstadt, called &quot;Winter Light&quot;, which plays as the credits roll; the song features lyrics set to one of Preisner&#x27;s orchestral themes (&quot;Awakening of Spring&quot;) in the film. In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in their list of the &quot;50 films you should see by the age of 14&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1901, recently orphaned 10-year-old Mary Lennox is sent from her home in British India to her uncle Lord Archibald Craven&#x27;s mansion, Misselthwaite Manor, in Yorkshire, England. She was unloved and neglected by her parents, who were killed in an earthquake in India. As a result, Mary is cold, self-centered and so repressed that she is unable to cry.

Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary that her uncle, who spends most of his time away, will likely not see her. Mary hears strange sounds of crying in the house and discovers a hidden door in her room that leads to uninhabited areas, including her aunt&#x27;s old room. There, she discovers a large key. Mrs. Medlock continuously sends Mary to play out on the grounds to keep her occupied whenever the crying starts in the house. Mary discovers her late Aunt Lilias&#x27; walled garden, which has been locked up since her death 10 years prior. She realizes that the key she found earlier unlocks the garden, but keeps it a secret. She befriends Dickon Sowerby, the younger brother of the manor&#x27;s housemaid, Martha. Dickon is an outdoorsy boy who is good with animals. Mary and Dickon slowly clean up the secret garden, and Mary becomes happier. She also finally meets her uncle, who is sullen but kind.

Hidden away in the mansion is Lord Craven&#x27;s son and Mary&#x27;s cousin, Colin Craven, who has been treated like a sickly invalid his entire life. A spoiled, short-tempered boy, he has never left his room nor ever walked and is confined to his bed or a wheelchair. His father barely comes to see him in fear that Colin will die soon and he will lose his son. Mary eventually discovers Colin, learning that he was the source of the crying in the house. Although taken aback by his difficult nature, she puts her foot down and refuses to give in to his whims, showing him that he is not really sick. Encouraged by Mary, Colin goes outside for the first time and Mary and Dickon take him to the secret garden.

The three children grow close and spend their free time in the garden every day, where Colin, with their help, learns to walk. The trio keep all of this a secret from the staff. Colin wants his father to be the first one to see him on his legs. Lord Craven has a dream of his late wife Lilias calling to him, and returns home. In the secret garden, he sees Colin walking for the first time, leaving him speechless with joy.

Mary bursts into tears for the first time in her life, certain that she is unwanted by her uncle and the garden will be locked up again as he had ordered it to be. Lord Craven reassures her that she is now part of the family. Promising never to lock it up again, he thanks her for bringing his family back to life. Dickon informs his older sister and the rest of the manor staff of the good news. The staff watches in shock and joy as Lord Craven and the children come home together.

The film ends with a voiceover of Mary stating that &quot;If you look the right way, the whole world is a garden&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Casting===
Heydon Prowse stated that American actor Elijah Wood auditioned for the role of Colin Craven before he won the role during an interview with Danyah Miller on July 23, 2021. American actress Kirsten Dunst auditioned for the role of Mary Lennox.

===Filming locations===

Yorkshire&#x27;s imposing Allerton Castle was used for most of the exterior shots of Misselthwaite Manor, and some of the interior was also used. Fountains Hall was also used for part of the exterior. Interiors of the former Midland Grand Hotel in London were used for filming as well, notably the scenes on the grand staircase.

==Soundtrack==
The film features the end credits song &quot;Winter Light&quot; performed by Linda Ronstadt, which is based on two themes from the score by Zbigniew Preisner. However, this song was not included in the film&#x27;s original soundtrack release, but was in Ronstadt&#x27;s eponymous album &quot;Winter Light&quot;. Sarah Brightman and the youngest member of Celtic Woman, Chloë Agnew, covered it for their albums &quot;Classics&quot; and &quot;Walking In The Air&quot; respectively. The soundtrack, released by Varèse Sarabande, contains the original score.

==Release==
The film was released in the United States and Canada on 13 August 1993. It grossed $31.2 million in the US and Canada. Internationally, it grossed $8.8 million for a worldwide total of $40 million.

===Critical reception===
Since its 1993 release, the film has garnered positive reviews. &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; has an approval rating of 89% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews, and an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Secret Garden&quot; honors its classic source material with a well-acted, beautifully filmed adaptation that doesn&#x27;t shy from its story&#x27;s darker themes&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;a work of beauty, poetry and deep mystery, and watching it is like entering for a time into a closed world where one&#x27;s destiny may be discovered.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the acting by young actors, calling their acts &quot;quite proficient and un-sappy too&quot;, but adding, &quot;it&#x27;s not their fault if they too often seem like chessmen being moved around on the director&#x27;s board, composed into picturesque tableaux&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that &quot;[the film is] executed to near perfection in all artistic departments&quot;, and called it &quot;[a] superior adaptation&quot;, mentioning that &quot;[the adaptation] of the perennial favorite novel will find its core public among girls, but should prove satisfying enough to a range of audiences&quot;.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;C+&quot; and called it &quot;earnest, heartfelt, and, for all its lavishness, rather plodding&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called this new adaptation of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; &quot;[an] elegantly expressive, a discreet and lovely rendering of the children&#x27;s classic by Frances Hodgson Burnett&quot;.

Trevor Johnston of &quot;Time Out&quot; said that &quot;With well-judged performances played straight, and topical subtexts (Green consciousness, the dysfunctional family), this &#x27;children&#x27;s&#x27; film sets no age limit on its potential audience&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
===Home media===
&quot;The Secret Garden&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States on 15 February 1994. It was originally released on VHS in the UK on 1 August 1994 and was re-released on 15 December 1997 by Warner Home Video. The DVD was released by Warner Home Video in 2005.

<text>The UK Singles Chart is the official record chart in the United Kingdom. Record charts in the UK began life in 1952 when Percy Dickins from &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) imitated an idea started in American &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine and began compiling a hit parade. Prior to this, a song&#x27;s popularity was measured by the sales of sheet music. Initially, Dickins telephoned a sample of around 20 shops asking for a list of the 10 best-selling songs. These results were then aggregated to give a Top 12 chart published in &quot;NME&quot; on 14 November 1952. The number-one single was &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; by Al Martino.

According to The Official Charts Company and Guinness&#x27; &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;, the &quot;NME&quot; is considered the official British singles chart before 10 March 1960. However, until 15 February 1969, when the British Market Research Bureau chart was established, there was no universally accepted chart. Other charts existed and different artists may have placed at number one in charts by &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, &quot;Disc&quot; or &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Alternatively, some considered the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot;, which averaged all these charts, to be a better indicator of the number-one single.

In terms of number-one singles, Frankie Laine, Guy Mitchell and Elvis Presley were the most successful artists of the 1950s, having four singles reach the top spot. The longest duration of a single at number one was eighteen weeks, achieved by Frankie Laine&#x27;s &quot;I Believe&quot;. &quot;I Believe&quot; still holds the record for the most non-consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart. It is believed that the three best-selling records of the decade – Bill Haley &amp; His Comets&#x27; &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;Diana&quot; and Harry Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;Mary&#x27;s Boy Child&quot; – all sold over one million copies.

==Number-one singles==




==By artist==
The following artists achieved three or more number-one hits during the 1950s. Artists Frankie Laine, Guy Mitchell and Elvis Presley were the most successful acts of the decade in terms of number-one singles, each having four singles reach the top of the chart. In total, Laine spent 32 weeks occupying the top of chart in the 1950s; the next highest was Presley who spent a total of 18 weeks at number one.
==By record label==

The following record labels had five or more number ones on the UK Singles Chart during the 1950s.

<text>The Black Mages were a Japanese instrumental rock band formed in 2002 by Nobuo Uematsu, Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito, who were three video game composers for Square and Square Enix. The band arranged Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series-based compositions in a hard rock style often similar to progressive metal, achieved with the additional use of synthesizers. A year later the band expanded to six members with the addition of Keiji Kawamori, Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda. In August 2010, Uematsu announced the band had been disbanded, but he would continue to perform rock arrangements of his music as a part of another similar band, known as the Earthbound Papas.

The band released three studio albums. Their first was released eponymously as &quot;The Black Mages&quot; in 2003, and contained arrangements of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; battle themes. The second album, &quot;The Black Mages II: The Skies Above&quot;, was released in 2004 and featured additional pieces besides battle themes including the group&#x27;s first original song, &quot;Blue Blast ~Winning the Rainbow&quot;, which was created for Japanese K-1 fighter Takehiro Murahama. The third album, &quot;The Black Mages III: Darkness and Starlight&quot;, was released in 2008. Music from the group has also appeared in other albums, including one track in &quot;Dark Chronicle Premium Arrange&quot;, an album of arranged music from the video game &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot;, a piece in the animated film &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot; and its corresponding soundtrack album, and one track on &quot;Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack&quot;, the soundtrack album for the Nintendo DS version of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;.

The Black Mages did not tour as a band, but performed several concerts to promote their album releases. For their first album they performed in Shibuya and Kanagawa, Japan in 2003 and later released a live video of the first concert on DVD exclusively to Uematsu fanclub members. They repeated this for the release of their second album, performing in Kawasaki and Osaka, Japan in 2005 and similarly released on DVD to fanclub members. The third album saw a performance in Yokohama, Japan in 2008; a DVD of the show was released commercially in March 2009. In addition to these concerts, The Black Mages made live appearances at two &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts, More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy and Voices - Music from Final Fantasy, as well as another video game music event, Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007.

== History ==

In 2000, Square Enix employees Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito formed an experimental partnership to compose music for the video game &quot;All Star Pro-Wrestling&quot; in a rock style. After the game&#x27;s success, the two continued to compose in the same style. In 2002, Fukui and Sekito decided to arrange some of the compositions of Nobuo Uematsu, the primary composer for the music of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Uematsu, a fan of rock music, enjoyed these arrangements, and Fukui and Sekito asked him to join them in making a rock band. Declining at first due to feeling too busy with his composing duties and attempts to become a music producer with his Smile Please label, Uematsu agreed to join them in a single live performance as a keyboardist. At the performance, Uematsu felt a &quot;mix of stage fright and excitement, [with] all the crowds cheering, the audience paying full attention&quot;, and decided to join the two in making a band; Fukui and Sekito had refused to start one if Uematsu was not involved as one of the musicians.

The group has said they were &quot;nervous&quot; about forming a rock band, as they were all &quot;middle-aged&quot;, but decided after the performance it would not be a problem. The name &quot;The Black Mages&quot; was chosen by an employee at Square Enix, Mr. Matsushita, and was decided to be in English because it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t stand out&quot; in Japanese. Square Enix owns the name &quot;The Black Mages&quot;, which means while using that name the band was essentially limited to playing &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music and original pieces rather than arranging music from other game series that were not owned by the company.

In 2003, Uematsu decided the band should produce an album of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; arrangements. The trio arranged, interpreted, and sequenced ten battle themes from various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, with Uematsu as producer; the album was released eponymously on February 19, 2003. To celebrate the success, Uematsu decided to organize a concert in tribute to the album; Uematsu and Fukui served as the keyboardists, while Sekito was the guitarist. They needed more people to perform the arrangements live, however, and as such, several other members from Square Enix joined. Keiji Kawamori joined to play the bass guitar, Michio Okamiya to play the guitar, and Arata Hanyuda to play the drums. Since then, The Black Mages have released two additional albums, with all six members participating. The group performed concerts to promote both of these albums, and also participated in video game music-themed concerts.

On August 7, 2010, Uematsu announced the band had formally disbanded. He did not directly state the reason for the decision, though in previous interviews he had noted the band was increasingly finding it difficult to find time to rehearse together. In an April 2011 interview he said the main reason was because The Black Mages had been formed as a &quot;Square Enix&quot; band, they were unable to perform arrangements of work he had composed after leaving Square Enix or to focus on original pieces. Uematsu continues to play rock arrangements of his music as a part of the band the Earthbound Papas, which performed at the Distant Worlds II concert in 2010. He has been joined by fellow Black Mages bandmates Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda, both continuing on guitar and drums, respectively. They had also left Square Enix; Uematsu built the new band to not include any current Square Enix employees so as to avoid the trademark and licensing problems of The Black Mages.

== Discography ==

=== &quot;The Black Mages&quot; ===

&quot;The Black Mages&quot; is an arranged soundtrack album of video game music from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series of role-playing video games. The album contains a selection of musical tracks from the games, arranged and performed in a hybrid of hard rock and progressive metal by The Black Mages. All the selected tracks are &quot;battle themes&quot; from the games. The pieces have been described as &quot;hard-rock&quot; with &quot;blazing synthesizers and guitars&quot;. It was first released on February 19, 2003, by DigiCube, and subsequently re-released on May 10, 2004, by Square Enix. It spans ten tracks and covers a duration of 51:29.

The album reached No. 43 on the Japan Oricon charts. It was well received by critics like Andy Byus of RPGFan, who termed it &quot;addicting&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot;. He criticized the overuse of synthesizer as opposed to live instruments in some tracks, and that some of the arrangements stayed too close to the original tracks, especially &quot;Dancing Mad&quot;. Tetra of Square Enix Music Online also enjoyed the album, saying &quot;all of the members are strong musicians, and Sekito and Fukui were equally strong arrangers&quot;. His primary complaint with the album was he felt many of the songs followed the same general pattern in their arrangements.

=== &quot;The Black Mages II: The Skies Above&quot; ===

&quot;The Black Mages II: The Skies Above&quot; is an arranged soundtrack album of video game music from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series of role-playing video games. Like the previous album, it contains a selection of musical tracks from the games, arranged and performed in a hybrid of hard rock and progressive metal by The Black Mages. Unlike their first album, &quot;The Skies Above&quot; includes other pieces besides battle themes; the album also features songs, which were performed by Kazco Hamano, credited as &quot;KAZCO&quot;, and Tomoaki Watanabe, or &quot;Mr. Goo&quot;. It also includes a non-&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; track, &quot;Blue Blast — Winning the Rainbow&quot;, an original piece that was created for Japanese K-1 fighter Takehiro Murahama. &quot;The Skies Above&quot;, as opposed to the first album, features real drums rather than sequenced drums, as the band had expanded from its original three members, none of whom played drums. The line &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m a Lion&quot; in the track of the same name was spoken by Alexander O. Smith, a translator for Square Enix and close friend of Okamiya, one of the new members. It was released on December 22, 2004, by Universal Music Group. The album spans eleven tracks, and covers a duration of 50:56.

The album received mixed reviews from critics; Jesse Jones of RPGFan said that he was &quot;simply amazed&quot; by the album, though it was not without flaws. While terming the music overall as &quot;excellent&quot;, he disliked the vocal arrangements in &quot;Otherworld&quot; and &quot;The Skies Above&quot;, finding that the voices of the singers did not match with the songs&#x27; instrumentals. Zane of Square Enix Music Online was less approving of the album, calling it &quot;passable&quot; and saying that the new arrangements gave &quot;mixed results&quot;. He blamed the &quot;intolerable vocals&quot; and occasional poor choices in instruments as the problems with the album, concluding that the second Black Mages album was inferior to the first.

=== &quot;The Black Mages III: Darkness and Starlight&quot; ===

&quot;The Black Mages III: Darkness and Starlight&quot; is the third arranged soundtrack album of video game music from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series of role-playing video games. The album contains a selection of musical tracks from the games, arranged and performed in a hybrid of hard rock and progressive metal by The Black Mages in a similar manner to their previous albums. It was released on March 19, 2008, by Uematsu&#x27;s Dog Ear Records, spanning ten tracks and a duration of 60:40. The Black Mages sing the chorus for the song &quot;Darkness and Starlight&quot;, the only vocal track on the album. The album has been described as being composed of a mix of &quot;intense&quot; symphonic metal pieces and rock opera. Like the previous album, &quot;Darkness and Starlight&quot; features an original piece, &quot;Life ~ in memory of KEITEN ~&quot;, which was composed by Uematsu for Yoshitaka Tagawa, a boy he had met who died of leukemia.

The album was well received by websites like RPGFan, which said the album was &quot;very much worth the over three year wait&quot; and described the tracks as &quot;enjoyable&quot; and &quot;inspiring&quot;. He had few complaints with the album, only describing &quot;Opening ~ Bombing Mission&quot; and &quot;Assault of the Silver Dragons&quot; as &quot;bland&quot;, but still worth listening to. Square Enix Music Online was even more positive in its review of the album, calling it &quot;a masterpiece&quot; and &quot;The Black Mages&#x27; finest effort to date&quot;, wishing only the album had been longer.

=== Other appearances ===
In addition to their own albums, pieces from The Black Mages have appeared on several other albums. The first of these was &quot;Flame Demon Monster Gaspard&quot; on &quot;Dark Chronicle Premium Arrange&quot;, an album of arranged music from the video game &quot;Dark Chronicle&quot; originally composed by Tomohito Nishiura. The album was released on April 21, 2004, by Team Entertainment. Their next appearance was in the animated film &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot; and its corresponding soundtrack album, where they played—together with orchestration conducted by Koji Haijima—&quot;Advent: One-Winged Angel&quot;, an arrangement of &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; originally composed by Uematsu and arranged by Shirō Hamaguchi. Their third appearance was on the soundtrack album for the Nintendo DS version of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, entitled &quot;Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack&quot;, with one track then titled &quot;Last Battle -THE BLACK MAGES Ver.-&quot;, but later re-titled &quot;KURAYAMINOKUMO&quot; (Cloud of Darkness) on the &quot;Darkness and Starlight&quot; album.

== Concerts ==
While The Black Mages never toured as a band, they participated in several concert events. These include promotional concerts for the release of their three albums and appearances at orchestral concerts devoted to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music.

=== Promotional concerts ===
The Black Mages held a concert to promote their first album on April 26, 2003, in the Shibuya-AX concert hall in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. This overnight concert featured the full setlist from the album, and introduced the track &quot;Matoya&#x27;s Cave&quot;, which would be featured in their next album. While the band members were being introduced, Okamiya performed the Chocobo theme and Uematsu performed the intro to Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Smoke on the Water.&quot; A DVD recording of the show was made and given to Uematsu fanclub members that year. The concert was repeated on November 3, 2003, at Kanagawa University in Kanagawa, Japan. This free concert was part of the Kanagawa Jindai Festa. As Uematsu graduated from Kanagawa University, The Black Mages all wore the school&#x27;s student uniform.

For their second album, The Black Mages performed two promotional concerts. They performed all the songs from their second album, along with &quot;The Decisive Battle&quot;, &quot;Those Who Fight Further&quot; and &quot;Clash on the Big Bridge&quot; from their first album. These concerts featured Kenji Ito, who performed piano renditions of pieces from the &quot;SaGa&quot; series. Also featured were muZik, a group who performed seven techno and pop-style &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; arrangements. The first concert set was at Club Citta in Kawasaki, Japan on January 22 and January 23, 2005, and the second one at Namba Hatch in Osaka, Japan on January 28, 2005. A DVD recording of the Kawasaki show was made and given to Uematsu fanclub members on February 1, 2006.

A live concert was performed for the release of The Black Mages&#x27; third album as for their previous albums. Performed at the Yokohama Blitz in Yokohama, Japan, on August 9, 2008, the concert featured all the pieces from the album with the exception of &quot;Life ~ in memory of KEITEN ~&quot; and with the addition of &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m a Lion&quot; and &quot;Clash on the Big Bridge&quot;. A DVD recording of the show was made and released commercially in 2009, a first for the band.

=== Other concerts ===
In addition to their own concerts, The Black Mages made appearances at official &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts. The first of these was the More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy event, held in the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California, on May 16, 2005; the concert was The Black Mages&#x27; first appearance in North America. The band performed &quot;The Rocking Grounds&quot; and &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m a Lion&quot; from their second album, and joined with the orchestra for &quot;Advent: One-Winged Angel&quot; as an encore to the concert. A recorded album was released on February 15, 2006, by Square Enix, and included the pieces by The Black Mages.

The second &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concert The Black Mages performed at was the Voices - Music from Final Fantasy concert held in Yokohama, Japan on February 18, 2006. This concert featured performances of various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; songs. The Black Mages played &quot;Advent: One-Winged Angel&quot; at the end of the concert along with the Prima Vista Philharmonic Orchestra; the song was played a second time as an encore. A DVD of the concert was released on June 21, 2006, and included an interview with Uematsu.

On July 7, 2007, The Black Mages appeared at the Extra: Hyper Game Music Event at Shinkiba Studio Coast in Tokyo. They were the last of thirteen artists and groups to play at the six-hour event, and performed &quot;Last Battle&quot;, &quot;Those Who Fight Further&quot;, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m a Lion&quot; and &quot;Clash on the Big Bridge&quot;. The music performed by The Black Mages did not appear on the official album for the concert.

<text>The Transcript, published at Ohio Wesleyan University, is the oldest independent college student newspaper in the United States.

The newspaper dates back to 1867 when it first appeared under the name Western Collegian. Joseph B. Battelle was the first editor of &quot;Western Collegian&quot;, at that time a student at Ohio Wesleyan University. Following his graduation from Wesleyan, Battelle would become one of the most prominent journalists at Toledo Blade.

Charles W. Fairbanks served as a co-editor of the Western Collegian. After graduation, Fairbanks went on to become a U.S. Senator and Vice-President of the U.S. under Theodore Roosevelt.

<text>Pointe-Saint-Charles (; also known in English as Point Saint Charles, and locally as The Point, or &quot;PSC&quot;) is a neighbourhood in the borough of Le Sud-Ouest in the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Historically a working-class area, the creation of many new housing units, the recycling of industrial buildings into business incubators, lofts, and condos, the 2002 re-opening of the Lachine canal as a recreation and tourism area, the improvement of public spaces, and heritage enhancement have all helped transform the neighbourhood and attract new residents. Community groups continue to be pro-active in areas related to the fight against poverty and the improvement of living conditions.

==History==

Twenty years after the founding of Ville-Marie (Montreal) by Paul Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve in 1642, he granted an area on the pointe Saint-Charles, extending into the St. Lawrence, to St. Marguerite Bourgeoys for agricultural use by the Congrégation de Notre-Dame. The sisters operated a sharecropping farm (&quot;métairie&quot;) on the land. From an area of about 30 &quot;arpents&quot; (about 10 hectares), the farm reached an area of 200 &quot;arpents&quot; (about 68 hectares) by the mid-18th century. The nuns built the Maison Saint-Gabriel, the only remaining trace of their farm and one of the oldest buildings in Montreal, on their property in 1698. Their farming activity only ceased altogether in the 1950s.
Until the mid-19th century, the area was chiefly agricultural. Urbanization began with the enlargement of the Lachine Canal (completed in 1848), as the transportation access and water power attracted industry to the whole of what is now the Sud-Ouest borough. The installation of railways and the construction of the Victoria Bridge (1854–1860) also attracted workers and spurred development. The then-owners, the Sulpician Order, divided the area into lots and auctioned them off starting in 1853, with the Grand Trunk Railway purchasing a large area for use as a railyard.

Numerous workers moved in, including numerous Irish immigrants as well as French-Canadians, English, Scots and in the early 20th century, the Poles, Ukrainians and the Lithuanians. Irish-Catholics and French-Canadians lived side by side in the Point, each community building its own Catholic church, also side by side on Centre Street: Saint Gabriel&#x27;s Parish (completed 1895) and Église Saint-Charles (completed 1905). The Polish Community was given permission by the Archdiocese of Montreal to build a church on Centre Street between Richmond and Montmorency Streets, Holy Trinity Church, which is still attended by the community from near and far. The Ukrainian Community also still returns to the Point to worship at Holy Ghost Parish on the corner of Grand Trunk and Shearer Streets. Numerous Protestant churches were also built during the late 1800s including Grace Anglican Church (built 1871 enlarged 1892), St. Mathew Presbyterian Church (built 1891, destroyed by fire in 1977), Centenary Methodist Church (built 1891, now a Seventh-Day Adventist church), and a Baptist church at the corner of Liverpool and Wellington streets (built 1900 and now used as a Sikh temple). Today, Pointe-Saint-Charles is considered the heart of historic Irish Montreal, with street names like Rue Saint-Patrick, Rue d&#x27;Hibernia, Place Dublin, and Rue des Irlandais testifying to that heritage.

By the 1860s, the area was a busy industrial neighbourhood and one of Canada&#x27;s first neighbourhoods offering housing to industrial workers. Notably, the development on Grand Trunk Row (today Rue Sébastopol) introduced the stacked &quot;duplex,&quot; based on British working-class housing, that would come to be so typical of neighbourhoods throughout Montreal. Building continued in the central Rushbrooke/Hibernia area until 1910.

The area straddled the Montreal city limit, and the part outside was set up as the village of Saint-Gabriel in 1874 and annexed to Montreal in 1887, becoming a city ward. In the early 20th century, Pointe-Saint-Charles was made up of two city wards: St. Gabriel, to the west, and St. Ann, to the east, which also included Griffintown and extended as far as McGill Street in what is now Old Montreal. The two were divided by the former city limit line, passing from the basin on the Lachine Canal just west of the St. Gabriel Locks to the riverbank just south of what is now the end of Ash Avenue.

Like the rest of the area around the Lachine Canal, the neighbourhood went into a long decline in the 1960s, caused by the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway and sealed by the closure of the Lachine Canal. The destruction of Goose Village and the construction of the Bonaventure Autoroute further impacted the area. Still, the neighbourhood reacted to the difficult times by forming bands of social solidarity. For example, the Clinique communautaire de Pointe-Saint-Charles was founded in 1968 to offer health and social services to local residents; it inspired the CLSC model used throughout the province, while remaining an independent clinic with the mandate of a CLSC. Several social housing developments were built in the 1970s; today, some 40% of the housing stock in Pointe-Saint-Charles is social housing. The Montreal Metro reached Pointe-Saint-Charles in 1978 with the construction of Charlevoix station.

However, in recent years, the neighbourhood has undergone gentrification. The Montreal Technoparc industrial park opened in 1988 on the site of a former landfill and dump site between the neighbourhood and the river. The rehabilitation of the Lachine Canal for recreational use spurred the reclamation of factories along the canal for lofts and condominiums. However, this has brought its own pressures as to increased rents and cost of living. The tradition of social solidarity continues, with residents banding together in 2005–2006 to successfully oppose a project to move the Montreal Casino to the area.

==Geography==

Located southwest of Downtown Montreal, it is bounded on the north by the Bonaventure Expressway, the east and southeast by the Saint Lawrence River, the southwest by the Décarie Expressway and Atwater Avenue, and the west and northwest by the Lachine Canal.

Adjacent neighbourhoods are Little Burgundy and Saint-Henri (across the canal to the north Montreal directions), Griffintown to the northeast, the wharves of the Old Port to the east, and the borough of Verdun to the west.

The residential part of the neighbourhood is bisected by the CN Rail line running through its centre on an elevated structure. A large industrial area, including the former CN rail yards, lies on landfill to the east; on the riverside, the Montreal Technoparc is home to film studios.

The point for which the area was named, located south of the modern area around Parc Le Ber, has long since disappeared under landfill. The name was reassigned to a new point at the southeastern tip of the area, opposite the northern point of Nuns&#x27; Island.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===

The neighbourhood is served by the Charlevoix metro station, with LaSalle station near the southwestern part of the neighbourhood in Verdun.

The area is ringed by the Décarie and Bonaventure Expressways, as well as Quebec Route 112 (Rue Bridge) leading to the Victoria Bridge. It is also the Montreal end of the Champlain Bridge complex (Île-des-Sœurs and Clément bridges) leading to Nuns&#x27; Island and the South Shore at Brossard. Major thoroughfares include Rue Saint-Patrick, Rue du Centre, Rue Wellington, and Rue Charlevoix.

The CN Rail, Via, and Amtrak lines to Montreal&#x27;s Central Station run through Pointe-Saint-Charles. As of 2011, with the closure of the Turcot Yards, CN has been performing switching operations and storing trains in the area, a practice denounced by local residents due to increased noise and danger from hazardous cargo in a residential area.

===Institutions===

The Clinique communautaire de Pointe-Saint-Charles is the primary health and social services institution in the area. La Maison Saint-Charles provides space for community groups.

===Culture and recreation===

 Recreational facilities include the YMCA, the Centre Saint-Charles, Saint-Gabriel Park, Le Ber Park, Marguerite Bourgeoys Park, and the Lachine Canal greenspace and bike trail, as well as road bike trails crossing through the neighbourhood. Historic buildings include the Maison Saint-Gabriel and Saint-Gabriel and Saint-Charles churches. The neighbourhood is served by the Bibliothèque Saint-Charles.

Pointe-Saint-Charles served as the setting for the 2006 movie &quot;The Point&quot;, a drama that takes place over one weekend about the stories of thirty-five teenagers and a mystery that haunts their neighbourhood.

<doc id="1136198" wikidata="Q2996086" url="?curid=1136198" title="Software patent debate">
<text>The software patent debate is the argument about the extent to which, as a matter of public policy, it should be possible to patent software and computer-implemented inventions. Policy debate on software patents has been active for years. The opponents to software patents have gained more visibility with fewer resources through the years than their pro-patent opponents. Arguments and critiques have been focused mostly on the economic consequences of software patents.

One aspect of the debate has focused on the proposed European Union directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, also known as the &quot;CII Directive&quot; or the &quot;Software Patent Directive,&quot; which was ultimately rejected by the EU Parliament in July 2005.

== Arguments for patentability ==
There are several arguments commonly given in defense of software patents or defense of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.

===Public disclosure===
* Through public disclosure, patents encourage the open sharing of information and additional transparency about legal exposure.
* Through public disclosure, patents encourage the transfer of mechanical technology, which may apply more broadly.

===Economic benefit===
*Software patents resulting from the production of patentable ideas can increase the valuation of small companies.
*Software patents increase the return on investment made, which includes government funded research.

===Encouragement of innovation===
*The ability to patent new software developed as a result of research encourages investment in software-related research by increasing the potential return of investment of said research.

===Copyright limitations===

Patents protect functionality. Copyright on the other hand only protects expression. Substantial modification to an original work, even if it performs the same function, would not be prevented by copyright. To prove copyright infringement also requires the additional hurdle of proving copying, which is not necessary for patent infringement.

Copyright law protects unique expressions, while patent law protects inventions, which in the case of software, are algorithms; copyright cannot protect a novel means of accomplishing a function, merely the syntax of one such means.

This means that patents incentivize projects that are unique and innovative in functionality rather than simply form. Copyrights, in turn, only incentivize uniqueness in form.

=== Protection for small companies ===
Software patents can afford smaller companies market protection by preventing larger companies from stealing work done by a smaller organization, leveraging their greater resources to go to market before the smaller company can.

===Hardware patents analogy===
Hardware and software are sometimes interchangeable. If people can patent hardware, then ideas describing software implemented by that hardware should also be patentable.

== Arguments against patentability ==
Opponents of software patents argue that:

=== Software is math ===
A program is the transcription of an algorithm in a programming language. Since every (Turing-complete) programming language implements Church&#x27;s lambda calculus by virtue of the Church-Turing thesis, a program is thus the transcription of a mathematical function. Math is not patentable. Therefore, neither is software.

===Software encourages patent thickets===
A patent thicket is a dense web of patents that companies must decipher to develop new technology. There are various types of patent thickets such as when a single innovation is protected by multiple patent holders or when a product is covered by numerous patents. The consequences of patent thickets are increased difficulty of innovation, complex cross-licensing relations between companies, and discouragement of newcomers from entering the software industry.

===Hinders research and development===
* Some scientific studies and expert reviews have concluded that patent systems paradoxically hinder technological progress and allows monopolies and powerful companies to exclude others from industrial science in a manner that is irreconcilable with anti-trust laws.
* Gary Becker, Nobel Prize–winning economist, argues, &quot;Their exclusion from the patent system would discourage some software innovations, but the saving from litigation costs over disputed patent rights would more than compensate the economy for that cost.&quot;

===Hinders innovation===
* The Electronic Frontier Foundation published the Defend Innovation whitepaper after doing two and a half years of research on software patents. They concluded that many overbroad software patents are being awarded, which is actually stifling innovation.
* Interoperability is thought to promote innovation, and patent systems have the potential to block the development of such technologies.
* There has been a lack of empirical evidence to suggest that patents have any positive effect on innovation, and furthermore, the system primarily “encourage[s] failing monopolists to inhibit competition by blocking innovation.”

===Cost and loss of R&amp;D funds===
*Should a software developer hire a patent attorney to perform a clearance search and provide a clearance opinion, there is no guarantee that the search could be complete. Different patents and published patent applications may use different words to describe the same concepts and thus patents that cover different aspects of the invention may not show up in a search. The cost of a clearance search may not prove cost effective to businesses with smaller budgets or individual inventors.
* For the U.S. the economic benefit is dubious. A study in 2008 found that American public companies’ total profits from patents (excluding pharmaceuticals) in 1999 were about $4 billion, but that the associated litigation costs were $14 billion.
* Software developers and hardware manufacturers may be forced to pay license fees for standards that are covered by patents (the so-called essential patents). Some examples are H.264, MP3 and GIF (that uses the patented LZW compression algorithm) and JPEG for graphics.

===Copyright===
*It is argued that traditional copyright has provided sufficient protection to facilitate massive investment in software development.
*Copyright is the right of an author(s) to prevent others from copying their creative work without a license. Thus the author of a particular piece of software can sue someone that copies that software without a license. Copyright protection is given automatically and immediately without the need to register the copyright with a government, although registration does strengthen protection. Copyrighted material can also be kept secret.

===Software is different===

* Software programs are different from other electromechanical devices because they are designed solely in terms of their function. The inventor of a typical electromechanical device must design new physical features to qualify for a patent. On the other hand, a software developer need only design new functions to create a working embodiment of the program.
* Software is a component of a machine. The computer’s hardware is generic; it performs functions that are common to all of the software that is capable of being executed on the computer. Each software program that is capable of executing on the computer is a component of the computer.
* Computers &quot;design&quot; and build the structure of executable software. Thus, software developers do not &quot;design&quot; the executable software&#x27;s physical structure because they merely provide the functional terms.

===Trivial patents===
*Anecdotal evidence suggests that some software patents cover either trivial inventions or inventions that would have been obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made.
*Patent examiners rarely have a comprehensive knowledge of the specific technologies disclosed in the patent applications they examine. This is in large part due to the enormous number of micro-niches in the software field and the very limited number of hours (often less than 8 h per patent) available to examiners to review patent applications. So, patents are sometimes allowed on inventions that appear to be trivial extensions of existing technologies.

===Open source disadvantage===

* The free and open source software community, and many companies that use and contribute to open source oppose software patents because they can impede or prohibit the distribution of free software. They contend that patents threaten to undermine FLOSS, regardless of innovations produced by FLOSS collaborations.

===Software patents&#x27; usefulness as an information source is limited===
*Some patent disclosures in the software field are not readable to some programmers; as a result, patents are rarely used as a source of technical information by software developers.

===Long patent pendencies===
* In the software industry, product lifecycles churn rapidly; a product can run through its entire lifecycle and become outdated during the time it takes a patent filed on the invention underlying it to issue.
*According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s official statistics for 2015, the average pendency for patent applications categorized under “Computer Architecture, Software, and Information Security” was approximately two and a half years, exceeding the pendencies of all other patent categories.
*The average total pendency of European technology patents in 2015 was approximately two and a half years. Technology patents in China, Korea, Japan, and Europe had first action pendencies of approximately one year compared to those in the United States, with first action pendencies of under two years. Europe and the United States have the longest total pendencies of around 26 months, while China, Korea, and Japan have shorter total pendencies from 15 to 21 months.

===Patent trolls===
*Software companies are becoming patent hoarders, spending billions of dollars on accumulating patents and even more on litigations and settlements – resources could be better put to use in creating new and innovative software advances. Too many patents are given out, making it difficult for developers to create new software due to possibility of accidental infringement. Engineers say it impedes their creativity.
*In 2016 IBM earned 8,088 U.S. patents; thus earning the most grants from the U.S. Patent Office for the 24th year in a row. They bested their closest tech rival by more than 2,500 patents. Behemoths like IBM, Google, and Oracle gather as many patents in the fields considered &#x27;hot&#x27; such as Artificial Intelligence to limit the innovation potential of smaller firms. Patent claims were part of the &quot;Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.&quot; case, where Oracle claimed that Google&#x27;s implementation of Java within Android violated Oracle&#x27;s copyright and patents. Duke Computer Science Professor Owen Astrachan was involved in the case. 
*Not only large companies are patent hoarders. NPEs (Non-Practising Entities) are businesses that assert patents through litigation to achieve revenues from alleged infringers without practising or commercialising the technology covered by the patents they hold, and generally without being the original inventor. NPEs are very effective in their litigations. Damages awards for NPEs almost are 3 times greater than practicing entities over recent years. NPE lawsuits are associated with half a trillion USD of lost wealth to defendants, mostly technology companies, from 1990 through 2010. These lawsuits substantially reduce technology developers&#x27; incentives to innovate.

===Disproportionately harms startups===
* Patent assertion entities (patent trolls) disproportionately affect startups, which are important for job creation and innovation. Companies with less than $100M annual revenue represent two-thirds of unique defendants in troll suits. A large percentage of startups reported that being sued by trolls resulted in significant operational impact.

== U.S. Supreme Court decisions ==
Several Supreme Court decisions since 2000, as well as the Federal Circuit and district court decisions interpreting and implementing them, have dramatically impacted the status of software patents in the United States. They have particularly affected many thousands of business-method patents that issued as a result of Federal Circuit decisions in the 1990s. The two principal Supreme Court decisions were &quot;Bilski v. Kappos&quot; and &quot;Alice v. CLS Bank&quot;, the latter of which confirmed the applicability of the earlier decision &quot;Mayo v. Prometheus&quot; to computer-related inventions in which a computer was used to implement an abstract principle or preexisting business practice. See also &quot;Software patents under United States patent law&quot;.

=== &quot;Bilski&quot; case ===
The &quot;Bilski&quot; case involved a patent application on methods for hedging against commodity price fluctuations, which the PTO had rejected. The Federal Circuit, in &quot;In re Bilski&quot;, upheld the PTO&#x27;s rejection on the grounds that the claims failed the machine-or-transformation test, which the court held should be used as the sole test of patent eligibility. The court did not hold that all business methods are patent ineligible, though a minority of the judges would have ruled that business methods are not properly the subject of patents.

The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of ineligibility, in &quot;Bilski v. Kappos&quot;, but on more general, and less articulated in detail, grounds of undue abstractness. It rejected the Federal Circuit&#x27;s elevation of the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test of patent eligibility, saying that rather it was simply a &quot;useful clue.&quot; The 5-4 majority refused to hold that all business methods were incapable of being patented, but four justices would have established such a rule. A concurring opinion pointed out that the Court was unanimous, however, as to many issues in the &quot;Bilski&quot; case, including a rejection of the Federal Circuit&#x27;s late 1990s &quot;State Street Bank&quot; decision, which allowed patents on any advance, technical or nontechnical (and in that case a numerical financial calculation of stock price changes) that produces a &quot;useful, concrete and tangible result.&quot;

The Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Bilski&quot; decision was criticized because of its lack of detailed guidance on how to determine whether a claim was directed to an abstract idea. Nonetheless, it provided some clarification and affirmed the Federal Circuit&#x27;s taking a new direction in its software-related patent cases.

=== &quot;Mayo&quot; case ===
In &quot;Mayo v. Prometheus&quot;, the Supreme Court invalidated a patent on a diagnostic method, because it non-inventively implemented a natural principle; the Court drew on cases involving computer software and other abstract ideas. In this case, the Court was much more detailed in describing how to recognize a patent-ineligible claim to an abstract idea. The &quot;Mayo&quot; methodology has come to dominate patent-eligibility law. It revived the approach of the &quot;Flook&quot; and &quot;Neilson&quot; cases, which is to treat the underlying principle, idea, or algorithm on which the claimed patent is based as if it were part of the prior art and to make patent eligibility turn on whether the implementation of it is inventive. This led to the &quot;two-step&quot; &quot;Alice&quot; test described next.

=== &quot;Alice&quot; case ===
At the time the &quot;Mayo&quot; case was decided, there was some uncertainty over whether it applied only to natural principles (laws of nature) or more generally to patent eligibility of all abstract ideas and general principles, including those involved in software patents. The &quot;Alice&quot; decision confirmed that the test was general. The &quot;Alice&quot; case involved patents on electronic methods and computer programs for financial-trading systems on which trades between two parties who are to exchange payment are settled by a third party in ways that reduce the risk that one party performs while the other does not. The patents cover what amounts to a computerized escrow arrangement.

The Court held that &quot;Mayo&quot; explained how to address the problem of determining whether a patent claimed an unpatentable abstract idea or instead a potentially patentable practical implementation of an idea. This requires using a &quot;two-step&quot; analysis.

In the first step, the court must determine whether the patent claim under examination contains an abstract idea, such as an algorithm, method of computation, a Law of Nature or other general principle. If not, the claim is potentially patentable, subject to the other requirements of the patent code. If the answer is affirmative, the court must proceed to the next step.

In the second step of the analysis, the court must determine whether the patent adds to the idea &quot;something extra&quot; that embodies an &quot;inventive concept.&quot; If there is no addition of an inventive element to the underlying abstract idea, the court finds the patent invalid under section 101. This means that the implementation of the idea must not be conventional or obvious to qualify for a patent. Ordinary and customary use of a general-purpose digital computer is insufficient; the Court said—&quot;merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform [an] abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.&quot;

The ruling continued with these points:

* A mere instruction to implement an abstract idea on a computer &quot;cannot impart patent eligibility.&quot;
* &quot;[T]he mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.&quot; 
* &quot;Stating an abstract idea &#x27;while adding the words &quot;apply it&quot;&#x27; is not enough for patent eligibility.&quot;
* &quot;Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea to a particular technological environment.&quot;

The &quot;Alice&quot; decision met a mixed reception, but profoundly affected U.S. patent law. In its wake, as explained in the Wikipedia article on the case, courts invalidated vast numbers of so-called software and business-method patents (the overwhelming majority of those the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered) and the number of such patents issued has drastically fallen. The &quot;Alice&quot; decision has been widely criticized for its failure to specify in detail the boundaries of patent eligibility, but it has also been defended because its unanimity tends to stabilize decisional law in the field.

=== Subsequent developments ===
After &quot;Alice&quot;, the Federal Circuit and district courts invalidated large numbers of business-method and software patents based on those courts&#x27; interpretations of &quot;Alice&quot;. Federal Circuit Judge William Bryson summed this up in these terms:
In short, such patents, although frequently dressed up in the argot of invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to perform some of those steps. The principal flaw in these patents is that they do not contain an “inventive concept” that solves practical problems and ensures that the patent is directed to something “significantly more than” the ineligible abstract idea itself. [Citing &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Mayo&quot;.] As such, they represent little more than functional descriptions of objectives, rather than inventive solutions. In addition, because they describe the claimed methods in functional terms, they preempt any subsequent specific solutions to the problem at issue. [Citing &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Mayo&quot;.] It is for those reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming “abstract ideas” and has held that they are not directed to patentable subject matter.

<text>Neither software nor computer programs are explicitly mentioned in statutory United States patent law. Patent law has changed to address new technologies, and decisions of the United States Supreme Court and United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) beginning in the latter part of the 20th century have sought to clarify the boundary between patent-eligible and patent-ineligible subject matter for a number of new technologies including computers and software. The first computer software case in the Supreme Court was &quot;Gottschalk v. Benson&quot; in 1972. Since then, the Supreme Court has decided about a half dozen cases touching on the patent eligibility of software-related inventions.

The eligibility of software, as such, for patent protection has been only scantily addressed in the courts or in legislation. In fact, in the recent Supreme Court decision in &quot;Alice v. CLS Bank&quot;, the Court painstakingly avoided the issue, and one Justice in the oral argument repeatedly insisted that it was unnecessary to reach the issue. The expression &quot;software patent&quot; itself has not been clearly defined. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has permitted patents to be issued on nothing more than a series of software computer instructions, but the latest Federal Circuit decision on the subject invalidated such a patent. The court held that software instructions as such were too intangible to fit within any of the statutory categories such as machines or articles of manufacture.
On June 19, 2014 the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International&quot; that &quot;merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform [an] abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.&quot;

The ruling continued:

[...] the mere recitation of a generic computer cannot transform a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention. Stating an abstract idea &quot;while adding the words &#x27;apply it&#x27;&quot; is not enough for patent eligibility.[] Nor is limiting the use of an abstract idea &quot;&#x27;to a particular technological environment.&#x27;&quot;[]. Stating an abstract idea while adding the words &quot;apply it with a computer&quot; simply combines those two steps, with the same deficient result. Thus, if a patent&#x27;s recitation of a computer amounts to a mere instruction to &quot;implemen[t]&quot; an abstract idea &quot;on . . . a computer,&quot; [] that addition cannot impart patent eligibility.

==Law==

===Constitution===

Article 1, section 8 of the United States Constitution establishes that the purpose of intellectual property is to serve a broader societal good, the promotion of &quot;the Progress of Science and the useful Arts&quot; :

Article 1, section 8 United States Constitution:

Congress shall have Power [. . .] To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries; . . .

===Statute===

Section 101 of title 35, United States Code, provides:

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.

However, there are restrictions on subject matter eligibility under Section 101 and in general the line between what is deemed patent eligible under Section 101 and what is ineligible changes is, as discussed below, a matter of ongoing judicial activity.

==History==

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the US Patent Office (as it was then called; the name was later changed to the US Patent and Trademark Office [PTO or USPTO]) and the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA) were at odds over the patent-eligibility of technical advances whose departure from the prior art was only in the use of a software algorithm. The Office rejected such claims and declined to patent them, but the CCPA repeatedly reversed the Office&#x27;s rulings and ordered the issuance of patents. The Office&#x27;s position was hampered during the 1960s by the uncertainty over whether the Supreme Court could review decisions of the CCPA, because it was unclear whether it was an Article I or Article III court. That question was resolved, however, in &quot;Brenner v. Manson&quot;, in which the Court held the CCPA an Article III court and that there was &quot;certiorari&quot; jurisdiction to review CCPA decisions.

The &quot;Manson&quot; decision also began a string of decisions in which the Supreme Court reversed decisions of the CCPA, and then those of its successor court the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), which had reversed decisions of the Patent Office or PTO denying a patent to an applicant.

=== &quot;Benson&quot; case ===

In the first of the Supreme Court&#x27;s computer software decisions (the &quot;patent-eligibility trilogy&quot;), &quot;Gottschalk v. Benson&quot;, the Court reversed the CCPA&#x27;s reversal of a Patent Office decision, thus denying a patent on an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numbers into pure binary numbers. In so ruling, the Court looked back to 19th century decisions such as &quot;O&#x27;Reilly v. Morse&quot;, which held that abstract ideas could not be made the subject of patents.

=== &quot;Flook&quot; case ===

The Court&#x27;s 1978 ruling in &quot;Parker v. Flook&quot;, was similar to &quot;Benson&quot; in principle. The &quot;Benson&quot; and &quot;Flook&quot; cases also established that a &quot;clue&quot; to whether a patent might be granted on a process was whether the process was carried out with a particular apparatus or else effectuated a transformation of an article from one state or thing to another state or thing. In &quot;Flook&quot;, where the sole departure from the prior art was concededly the formula or algorithm, no transformation was alleged, and it was conceded that the implementing apparatus was old or conventional, the process was simply not the kind of process that could be patented. The principle, stated in &quot;Flook&quot;, that to be patent eligible the implementation of an abstract idea or law of nature must be inventive, rather than routine or conventional, became of paramount importance in Supreme Court jurisprudence at the beginning of the 21st century. (This occurred in the &quot;Mayo&quot; and &quot;Alice&quot; cases.)

=== &quot;Diehr&quot; case ===

In the 1981 case of &quot;Diamond v. Diehr&quot;, the United States Supreme Court upheld the CCPA&#x27;s reversal of the Patent Office, and ordered the grant of a patent on a process for curing rubber in a mold, a substantial part of which involved use of a computer program that used a well-known formula (the Arrhenius Equation) for calculating the time when rubber was cured and the mold could therefore be opened. The Supreme Court stated that in this case, the invention was not merely a mathematical algorithm, but a process for molding rubber, which used the mathematical formula for an industrial purpose, and was therefore patent eligible. In the &quot;Diehr&quot; case, there was no concession (as there was in &quot;Flook&quot;) that the implementation was conventional, and the process did effectuate a transformation of substances (from uncured rubber to cured rubber).

The Supreme Court later explained the meaning of this decision and how it actually harmonized with &quot;Benson&quot; and &quot;Flook&quot; in the Court&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Mayo&quot; opinion. In the &quot;Mayo&quot; case, the Court explained that Diehr had not simply claimed the Arrhenius Equation implemented in a non-inventive machine but had instead implemented it in a way that the &quot;Diehr&quot; Court had found inventive. Under this interpretation, &quot;Diehr&quot; satisfied the requirements that the Court had earlier found not to have been met in the &quot;Flook&quot; case.

=== Pre-1994 period ===

After this point, more patents on software began to be granted, albeit with conflicting and confusing results. Patenting grew at a rate of 21% per year for high tech companies during this period. This was due in part to judicial decisions during this period that limited the scope of software copyright protection. After its creation in 1982, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) charted a course that tried to follow the &quot;Diehr&quot; precedent. Patents were allowed only if the claim included some sort of apparatus, even rather nominal apparatus at times, such as an analog-to-digital converter front end, or in one case a scratch-pad memory for storing intermediate data. A representative decision from this period is &quot;In re Schrader&quot;, in which the CAFC set forth probably its best and most detailed formulation of the rule it was attempting to follow.

===&quot;Alappat&quot; case ===

Dissatisfaction with the perceived artificiality of this rule erupted, however, in rulings beginning with the &quot;en banc&quot; 1994 decision in &quot;In re Alappat&quot;, in which the CAFC majority held that a novel algorithm combined with a trivial physical step constitutes a novel physical device. Therefore, a computing device on which is loaded a mathematical algorithm is a &quot;new machine,&quot; which is patent-eligible.

This ruling was immediately preceded by &quot;In re Lowry&quot;, which held that a data structure representing information on a computer&#x27;s hard drive or memory is similarly to be treated as a patent-eligible physical device, and in which the Solicitor General&#x27;s Office declined the PTO&#x27;s request to seek certiorari. As a result, the PTO did not even request that the Solicitor General&#x27;s Office seek certiorari in the &quot;Alappat&quot; case.

=== &quot;State Street Bank&quot; case and aftermath ===

Finally, in &quot;State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group&quot;, the CAFC ruled that a numerical calculation that produces a &quot;useful, concrete and tangible result&quot;, such as a price, is patent-eligible.
The USPTO&#x27;s reaction to this change was, for the time being at least, to &quot;throw in the towel.&quot; The Clinton administration appointed Bruce Lehman as Commissioner of the USPTO in 1994. Unlike his predecessors, Lehman was not a patent lawyer but the chief lobbyist for the Software Publishing Industry. In 1995, the USPTO established some broad guidelines for examining and issuing software patents. The USPTO interpreted the decisions of the Federal Circuit as requiring the USPTO to grant software patents in a broad variety of circumstances. Although the U.S. Congress has never legislated specifically that software is patentable, the CAFC interpreted the broad description of patentable subject in section 101 of the Patent Act of 1952 and the failure of Congress to change the law after the CAFC decisions allowing software patents as an indication of Congressional intent. The reaction of the defeated-feeling USPTO was characterized in the cartoon shown at right, which appeared in &quot;IEEE Micro&quot; in 1995.

=== Case law after 2000 ===

The United States Supreme Court remained silent on these decisions and developments for years. The first response appeared in a dissenting opinion in &quot;LabCorp v. Metabolite, Inc.&quot; (2006). Although &quot;certiorari&quot; had been granted, the Court dismissed it as improvidently granted; the minority dissent argued that the question of statutory subject matter in patent law should be addressed. Justice Breyer&#x27;s dissent stated:

[&quot;State Street&quot;] does say that a process is patentable if it produces a &#x27;useful, concrete, and tangible result.&#x27; But this Court has never made such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement would cover instances where this Court has held the contrary.
He continues to directly address the claim that software loaded onto a computer is a physical device:

. . . And the Court [in &quot;Gottschalk v. Benson&quot;] has invalidated a patent setting forth a process that transforms, for computer-programming purposes, decimal figures into binary figures—even though the result would seem useful, concrete, and at least arguably (within the computer&#x27;s wiring system) tangible.

At about the same time, in a concurring opinion in &quot;eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.&quot;, Justice Kennedy (joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer) questioned the wisdom of permitting injunctions in support of &quot;the burgeoning number of patents over business methods,&quot; because of their &quot;potential vagueness and suspect validity&quot; in some cases.

===&quot;Bilski&quot; case===

This was followed by the decision of the CAFC in &quot;In re Bilski&quot;, which opened a new chapter in this history. In &quot;Bilski&quot;, as the article on that case explains[What article?], the CAFC superseded &quot;State Street&quot; and related decisions with a return to the tests of the patent-eligibility trilogy (&quot;Benson-Flook-Diehr&quot;), although while those decisions had merely treated the machine-or-transformation test as a clue to past decisions the CAFC attempted to make that test dispositive.

However, in 2009 the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment but overturned the CAFC&#x27;s rationale in &quot;Bilski&quot;, stating that the machine-or-transformation test is not the exclusive test of patentability. At the same time, the Court (per Justice Kennedy) held, 5-4, that Bilski&#x27;s software, business-method patent application was patent ineligible because it was directed to an abstract idea, largely preempting hedging as a business expedient. But the majority declined to rule all business-method patents ineligible. Justice Stevens, in one of his last opinions before retiring from the Court, concurred in the judgment but disagreed with the majority&#x27;s rationale. Joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, he argued that the claimed invention was patent ineligible because it was a business method (advancing much the same analysis as that in Judge Dyk&#x27;s opinion in the Federal Circuit) and therefore outside the reach of the patent system. Justice Breyer filed a concurring opinion in which he explained the points on which all nine justices agreed.

===&quot;Mayo&quot; case===

&quot;Bilski&quot; was followed by the Court&#x27;s unanimous opinion in &quot;Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Labs, Inc.&quot; Although it did not involve a software patent (it concerned a medical assay implementing a natural principle), it stated a methodology for determining patent eligibility that is currently dominant in software cases. It revived the approach of the &quot;Flook&quot; and &quot;Neilson&quot; cases, which is to treat the underlying principle, idea, or algorithm on which the claimed patent is based as if it were part of the prior art and to make patent eligibility turn on whether the implementation of it is inventive.

===&quot;Alice&quot; case===

In May, 2013, the CAFC issued a fragmented &quot;en banc&quot; decision in &quot;CLS Bank International v. Alice Corp.&quot; in which the judges were unable to reach a coherent unified decision on the patentability of the business-method software claims at issue. The case went to the Supreme Court, which decided it on June 19, 2014.

The Court used the analysis from the &quot;Mayo&quot; decision and held Alice&#x27;s patents invalid as directed to an abstract idea. As in &quot;Bilski&quot;, the Court did not rule all business-method patents ineligible. However, the Court&#x27;s requirement (as in &quot;Mayo&quot; and &quot;Flook&quot;) for an &quot;inventive concept&quot; for the implementation of the principle underlying the claimed method and its insistence that &quot;merely saying [to] apply it with a computer&quot; is not enough to confer patent eligibility may doom many or most business-method software patents.

=== Post-&quot;Alice&quot; period===

Since the &quot;Alice&quot; decision, the Federal Circuit and district courts have held a number of business-method patents to be patent ineligible as mere abstract ideas implemented in a conventional way without embodying any inventive concept.

====&quot;Digitech&quot;====

In &quot;Digitech Image Technologies, LLC v. Electronics for Imaging, Inc.&quot;, the Federal Circuit invalidated a patent on a &quot;device profile&quot; and methods for generating &quot;device profiles.&quot; The device profile was a collection of information about a graphic image, and it was generated by combining data sets containing such information. The court held that the device and method for generating it were abstract ideas and patent ineligible: &quot;Without additional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to manipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent eligible.&quot;

====&quot;buySAFE&quot;====

In &quot;buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc.&quot;, the Federal Circuit invalidated under section 101 a patent on a computerized surety system for online transactions. The court said the computer implementation of the underlying surety idea was &quot;not even arguably inventive.&quot; The court concluded: &quot;In short, with the approach to this kind of section 101 issue clarified by &quot;Alice&quot;, it is a straightforward matter to conclude that the claims in this case are invalid.&quot; The court remarked in passing, however, that if &quot;enough extra is included in a claim, it passes muster under section 101 even if it amounts to a business method.&quot; But the court did not explain or illustrate what would be &quot;enough extra.&quot;

====&quot;DDR Holdings&quot;====

In &quot;DDR Holdings v. Hotels.com&quot;, the Federal Circuit upheld one patent and invalidated several others under &quot;Alice&quot;. This is the only instance since the &quot;Alice&quot; decision in which the Federal Circuit held a patent to be eligible. The court said that the eligible patent solved an Internet-centric problem in an inventive way. (It essentially framed one website within another, so that it appeared to be a part of the other site.)

====&quot;Versata v. SAP&quot;====

In &quot;Versata Development Group, Inc. v. SAP America, Inc.&quot;, the Federal Circuit summarized its holdings in several other post-&quot;Alice&quot; cases that are not summarized above. The following summaries are extracted from the Federal Circuit&#x27;s opinion in the &quot;Versata&quot; case:
* In &quot;Ultramercial&quot;, [the Federal Circuit] found that claims directed to the abstract idea of using an advertisement as an exchange or currency were ineligible even though the claims were tied to a general purpose computer and invoked the Internet.
* In &quot;Content Extraction &amp;Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, National Ass&#x27;n&quot;, [the Federal Circuit] found that claims directed to the abstract idea of collecting data from hardcopy documents, recognizing certain information within the collected data, and storing that information in memory were ineligible. This was true despite noting that, if the claims were construed in the most favorable manner to the appellants, the claims would require scanning and processing technology.

The &quot;Versata&quot; court also summarized two pre-&quot;Alice&quot; decisions in which the rulings were consistent with &quot;Alice&quot;:

* In &quot;Bancorp Services, L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assurance Co.&quot;, [the Federal Circuit] found ineligible claims directed to the abstract idea of managing a stable value life insurance policy. 
* In &quot;CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc.&quot;, [the Federal Circuit] found that a broadly worded method claim and a claim reciting a computer readable medium for executing the method claim were ineligible. [The Federal Circuit] concluded the claims were drawn to a method of verifying the validity of credit card transactions over the Internet, and the steps in the method could be performed in the human mind or by a human using a pen and paper.

In the 2015 &quot;Versata&quot; case, itself, the Federal Circuit affirmed the final order of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), the recently created adjudicatory arm of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), invalidating as patent ineligible the claims in issue of Versata&#x27;s patent on a method of determining what price to charge a customer. It said, &quot;Using organizational and product group hierarchies to determine a price is an abstract idea that has no particular concrete or tangible form or application.&quot; Moreover, the implementation was a &quot;purely conventional&quot; use of a computer.

====&quot;Loyalty Conversion&quot; and other 2014 district court cases====

The software cases after &quot;Alice&quot; adopt its method of legal analysis, based on the decision of the Supreme Court in the &quot;Mayo&quot; case. This calls for a two-step analysis. First, the court determines whether the claimed invention is based on an abstract idea or principle of some sort, often expressed at a high level of generality, such as a computerized escrow or surety arrangement, as in the &quot;Bilski&quot; and &quot;Alice&quot; cases. If the claimed invention is directed to an abstract idea, the court proceeds to the second step of analysis, which is to determine whether the patent adds &quot;something extra&quot; to the idea that embodies an &quot;inventive concept.&quot; If there is no addition of an inventive element to the underlying abstract idea, the court will find the patent invalid under section 101.

Few software patents have survived this analysis since the &quot;Alice&quot; decision, largely because they are written in purely functional language to claim a result rather than describe a structure for accomplishing a result. Thus, Federal Circuit Judge Bryson explained when sitting by designation as a trial judge in the &quot;Loyalty v. American Airlines&quot; case:

In short, such patents, although frequently dressed up in the argot of invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to perform some of those steps. The principal flaw in these patents is that they do not contain an &quot;inventive concept&quot; that solves practical problems and ensures that the patent is directed to something &quot;significantly more than&quot; the ineligible abstract idea itself. See &quot;CLS Bank&quot;, 134 S. Ct. at 2355, 2357; &quot;Mayo&quot;, 132 S. Ct. at 1294. As such, they represent little more than functional descriptions of objectives, rather than inventive solutions. In addition, because they describe the claimed methods in functional terms, they preempt any subsequent specific solutions to the problem at issue. See &quot;CLS Bank&quot;, 134 S. Ct. at 2354; &quot;Mayo&quot;, 132 S. Ct. at 1301-02. It is for those reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming &quot;abstract ideas&quot; and has held that they are not directed to patentable subject matter.

====What software patents will survive &quot;Alice&quot; analysis?====

The question has been raised, therefore, what kinds of software-related patents will survive the analysis prescribed in &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Mayo&quot;. The question was considered during the oral argument of the &quot;Alice case&quot;, although not more than cursorily in the opinion. Counsel for &quot;CLS Bank&quot; suggested that data compression and data encryption were software technologies that are likely to be patent-eligible because they address &quot;a business problem, a social problem, or a technological problem.&quot; The Solicitor General, as &quot;amicus curiae&quot;, said that it would be difficult to identify a patent-eligible business method unless it involved an improved technology, such as &quot;a process for additional security point-of-sale credit card transactions using particular encryption technology&quot; – &quot;that might well be patent eligible.&quot;

At least one commentator has questioned that, however, because encryption largely consists of mathematical operations using modular arithmetic and theorems of Euler. Yet, as the commentator points out, in the &quot;Flook&quot; case the Supreme Court said: &quot;As the CCPA has explained, &#x27;if a claim is directed essentially to a method of calculating, using a mathematical formula, even if the solution is for a specific purpose, the claimed method is nonstatutory [patent ineligible].&#x27; &quot; Furthermore, in July 2014, just after the &quot;Alice&quot; decision came down, a Federal Circuit panel held a patent ineligible, quoting &quot;Flook&quot; and adding: &quot;Without additional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to manipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent eligible.&quot; Judge Bryson&#x27;s comments, quoted above, may therefore be more predictive of the likely outcomes of future software-related patent cases, including encryption ones, than counsel&#x27;s assurances during oral argument in the &quot;Alice&quot; case.

====&quot;Allvoice&quot;====

In &quot;Allvoice Developments US, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.&quot;, the Federal Circuit in a May 2015 nonprecedential opinion invalidated patent claims to a speech recognition &quot;interface&quot; without undertaking an &quot;Alice&quot; analysis. The so-called interface was entirely a set of software instructions, claimed in means-plus-function form. The court found it unnecessary to go through the two-step analysis because a set of instructions is not a machine or article of manufacture or composition of matter, and it did not purport to be a process. Accordingly, the claimed subject matter did not fit within any of the statutory categories of section 101, which defines patentable subject matter. Moreover, it was intangible, and in the &quot;Digitech&quot; case, the Federal Circuit had held that except for processes, &quot;eligible subject matter must exist in some physical or tangible form.&quot;

<doc id="1136202" wikidata="Q7832413" url="?curid=1136202" title="Trafalgar Dock">
<text>Trafalgar Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, in England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Vauxhall and connected to Salisbury Dock to the north. The sites of two former docks are located in the vicinity; Victoria Dock was located to the south and Clarence Dock to the east.

==History==
Trafalgar Dock was designed by Jesse Hartley, opened in 1836 and named after the Battle of Trafalgar.

During the early 1990s, most of the dock basin was used as a designated landfill site. This has left only a section of the northern part of the dock and a narrow channel along the eastern dock wall. 
What remains of the dock provides access to Clarence Graving Docks.

In 2007, work began on a £20 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further of navigable waterway. 
A new -wide channel was excavated through Trafalgar Dock to the northern end of West Waterloo Dock as part of the canal route.
