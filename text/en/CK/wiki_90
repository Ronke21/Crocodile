<text>The Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC), Arnold Engineering Development Center before July 2012, is an Air Force Materiel Command facility under the control of the Air Force Test Center (AFTC). Named for General Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, the father of the U.S. Air Force, AEDC is the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world.

Headquartered at Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee, the Complex also operates from geographically separated units at Ames Research Center, Mountain View and Edwards AFB, California; Peterson AFB, Colorado; Eglin AFB, Florida; the Federal Research Center at White Oak, Maryland; Holloman AFB, Kirtland AFB, and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and Hill AFB, Utah. AEDC operates more than 68 test facilities, including, but not limited to, aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket and turbine engine test cells, environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges, sled tracks, centrifuges, and other specialized test units.

AEDC conducts developmental testing and evaluation through modeling, simulation, ground, and flight testing. Testing aims to evaluate aircraft, missile, and space systems/subsystems at the flight conditions they will experience during a mission. The complex aims to be the best value U.S. ground test and analysis source for aerospace and defense systems.

==Environmental issues==

Several areas of the facility are contaminated by substances including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organic compounds and spills of jet and rocket fuel, chlorofluorocarbon solvents, nitric acid and other materials. PCBs from the site have been detected in local creeks, in the water, sediment and in fish.

The site was proposed for addition to the Superfund National Priorities List in August 1994 though, as of May 2010, the site has not been added to the NPL. The Environmental Protection Agency believes that human exposure to contaminants and contaminated groundwater migration are under control.

==History==
The Air Engineering Development Center was authorized by an act of the 81st Congress, Public Law 415, approved 27 Oct. 1949 (Appendix 2).

On 7 March 1950, the Air Engineering Development Center was redesignated the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) effective 10 February 1950, per General Order #23, signed by then-Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg. Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) was later redesignated Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) on 6 July 2012.

The complex is a part of a master unitary wind tunnel plan that is designated to provide the testing &quot;tools&quot; required to assure the United States continued air and space supremacy.

The necessity for an aeronautical test complex of this type was recognized by a number of different agencies of the government, as well as by expert technical groups from the industrial-scientific world. The creation of these research and testing facilities has enabled the U.S. to stay abreast of developments in this fast-moving field.

AEDC is one of the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world with a replacement value of more than $7.8 billion.

At one time or another, the center has operated 58 aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges and other specialized units. Twenty-seven of the center&#x27;s test units have capabilities unmatched elsewhere in the United States; 14 are unique in the world.

Facilities can simulate flight conditions from sea level to 300 miles&#x27; altitude and from subsonic velocities to Mach 14.

AEDC&#x27;s mission is to:

* Test and evaluate aircraft, missile and space systems and subsystems at the flight conditions they will experience during a mission to help customers develop and qualify the systems for flight, improve system designs and establish performance before production. It also helps users troubleshoot problems with operational systems.
* Conduct a research and technology program to develop advanced testing techniques and instrumentation and to support the design of new test facilities. Continuous improvement helps satisfy testing needs and keeps pace with rapidly advancing aircraft, missile and space system requirements.
* Maintain and modernize the center&#x27;s existing test facilities.

AEDC is an important national resource and has contributed to the development of practically every one of the nation&#x27;s top priority aerospace programs, including better spacelift, aircraft, missiles and satellites. Many of these programs are highlighted in the following sections.

AEDC is an Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) organization managed by the Air Force but operated largely by a contractor work force. While AEDC&#x27;s primary location is in Tennessee, it also operates two geographically separated facilities—the Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel 9 in Maryland, and the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC), in California.

AEDC&#x27;s economic impact to the local area for fiscal year 2008 exceeded $728 million. The total economic impact includes the center&#x27;s payroll, secondary jobs created locally though the spending of that payroll, and other expenditures for supplies, utilities, fuel and services.

As a consultant to General Arnold, Theodore von Kármán first called for the center:
:In 1947 Stuart Symington became the first secretary of the newly independent Air Force, and he strove hard to bring into reality some of my proposals, particularly the new facilities for Air Force research which I had urged in the report.
:One of the main items was a new U.S. center for the study and development of jet propulsion, supersonic aircraft, and ballistic missiles, a center I hoped would be greater than any then known. The proposal had actually begun after Frank Wattendorf&#x27;s 1945 visit to the huge wind tunnel at Ötztal, Austria, which was bigger and more powerful than any in the United States.

:Symington managed to round up sufficient support in Congress and to obtain the necessary funds, about 100 million dollars. The Air Force agreed to go ahead with the proposal to set up the center, and a committee was appointed which traveled around the country seeking a suitable site. One of the necessary requirements was a direct source of stored hydraulic power, as planned at Ötztal, to run the multi-thousand horsepower motors needed for the big wind tunnels.

:Senator McKellar, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, [made] a clever offer. He said the state of Tennessee would give up Camp Forest, a 40,000-acre World War II camp near Tullahoma, if the Air Force would set up its huge center there. Congress was about to adjourn and it looked like nothing would get done for another year. The Air Force, being realistic, accepted the offer ... The Arnold Engineering Development Center (as it was finally named) was dedicated in Tullahoma by President Truman in 1952.

The center operates more than 68 aerodynamic and propulsion wind tunnels, rocket and turbine engine test cells, space environmental chambers, arc heaters, ballistic ranges, and other specialized units. Currently, AEDC&#x27;s Test Operations and Sustainment contractor is Beyond New Horizons.

The center has helped to develop most aerospace systems in the U.S. government&#x27;s inventory, including the Atlas, Titan, Minuteman and Peacekeeper ICBMs, the Space Shuttle, space station, and Projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.

It is named for General Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, the father of the US Air Force and an air power visionary. The University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) is located adjacent to AEDC.

The center lies near Manchester, Tennessee and Tullahoma, Tennessee, and occupies much of the site of the former Camp Forrest, a U.S. Army base and World War II POW camp. It is unique in that the majority of the workforce are contract personnel, with a small contingent of active-duty assigned.

&quot;The Air Force Test Center (AFTC) started an organizational change process in 2015 to move some units within the AFTC from the 96th and 412th Test Wings over to the AEDC. The largest change [was] the renumbering of the 96th Test Group as the 704th Test Group at Holloman AFB, NM. AEDC ..also [gained] the McKinley Climatic Laboratory at Eglin AFB, FL, and the Hypersonic Combined Test Force at Edwards AFB, CA.&quot; The changes took effect on 1 December 2016. It was planned to align &quot;..most of the Air Force’s developmental ground test facilities under one commander, better fiscal synergy, especially in restoration and modernization funds, better balance in the span of control, and finally results in developmental opportunities for AFTC officers.&quot;

<doc id="1146563" wikidata="Q980315" url="?curid=1146563" title="Little Joe (electric locomotive)">
<text>The Little Joe is a type of railroad electric locomotive built by General Electric. The locomotives had twelve axles, eight of them powered, in a 2-D+D-2 arrangement. They were originally intended to be exported to the Soviet Union and designed to operate on Soviet Railways (SZhD) 3,300-volt DC overhead line system. They were never exported to the Soviet Union due to rising political tensions. Only 20 were built, with 15 sold to domestic operators and five exported to Brazil.

==History==
After World War II, the Soviet Railways continued its electrification program, this time targeting the Kropachyovo-Zlatoust-Chelyabinsk line of the South Urals Railway. As local factories were recovering from the war efforts, the Soviet government (then led by Joseph Stalin), ordered 20 of these locomotives. Known by their factory classification of GE 2-D+D-2 406/546 8-GE 750-3300V, in the Soviet Union, they would have received the classification of the A-series locomotive, with the A standing for &quot;Amerikanskiy elektrovoz&quot; (), meaning &quot;American electric locomotive&quot;. At the time this was the world&#x27;s strongest electric locomotive, with a power output of being comparable to the Union Pacific Big Boy.

The locomotives were built by General Electric (GE) at Erie, Pennsylvania, with the supervision of Soviet specialists. The Ministry of Railways of the USSR was so confident about receiving these locomotives, that they were also allocated running numbers, initially 1591-1610 and later 2301-2320. The first test run of the locomotive (unit A1598) took place on 7 September 1948 on a test track of the New York Central Railroad.

GE built 20 locomotives of this type, but the company was prohibited from delivering them as relations between the United States and Soviet Union deteriorated into what became known as the Cold War. Fourteen were built to the Soviet gauge of and the final six were built to .

The locomotives were never delivered because the State Department banned sales of strategic goods to the Soviet Union whilst production was underway. This included the electric locomotives, which were considered strategic to the Soviet Railways. Before the ban, the tensions between the US and USSR caused the Soviet railway engineers to be recalled back to their country. GE completed the locomotives, but they were left with no owner. Two were damaged during the trials. Although minimal, unit 29924 collided with unit 29923, causing significant damage to the leading axle. 

The Soviet Union was then forced to design its own locomotive, the N8 (later VL8), which ran in 1953. This led to the development of the VL10 (3 kV DC) and VL80 (25 kV AC) locomotives. 

=== Milwaukee Road ===

The Milwaukee Road had offered to buy all 20 locomotives, plus their spare parts, for $1million ($ in adjusted for inflation). That was little more than scrap value, but GE accepted. However, the Milwaukee&#x27;s Board of Directors would not release the money. Nonetheless, unit 29927 was tested on 24 December 1948 on the Milwaukee Road, but it revealed some issues during trials.

Demand during the Korean War boosted the Milwaukee&#x27;s need for locomotives on their electrified mainline. The railroad was also beset by a coal strike that required sending most diesels back East (Milwaukee Lines East steam engines still burned coal, unlike the oil-burning Lines West steamers). So the Board of Directors returned to GE, only to discover that eight locomotives and all the spare parts had been sold. Three had gone to the Chicago South Shore &amp; South Bend Railroad (the South Shore Line), and five to the Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro of Brazil.

Still, the Milwaukee Road bought the remaining 12 locomotives for $1 million. The railroad designated its new locomotives as &quot;class EF-4&quot;, denoting them as the line&#x27;s fourth model of electric freight engine. Two units were modified before delivery for passenger service; these were designated &quot;class EP-4&quot;. The Milwaukee&#x27;s operating employees referred to the EF-4/EP-4 units as &quot;Little Joseph Stalin&#x27;s locomotives,&quot; which was eventually shortened to simply Little Joe.

====Performance====
As originally tested, the Milwaukee was not impressed with these locomotives, finding them prone to wheelslip. The World War I-vintage General Electric motor-generator substations had difficulty supplying more than two EF-4s under heavy load, which meant that their true ability could not be demonstrated. Additionally, the controls were initially labelled in Russian. After being modified with increased weight, raising the maximum height of the pantographs and being provided with adequate power, the EF-4s were excellent performers and very reliable. Some substations were later modified to supply up to 3,400 volts to take advantage of the high power of these locomotives.

====Modifications====
The E20 and E21 locomotives became EP-4 engines to be used for passenger service. They were modified before delivery to remove driving controls and windows at one end to permit moving new, improved main circuit breakers into a cooler environment. The Milwaukee Shops replaced the operating controls in the &quot;B&quot; end with a steam generator before they entered service. The loss of this cab was operationally inconsequential, as many Milwaukee electric locomotives were normally turned at the end of their runs in Avery, Deer Lodge or Harlowton, the road having preferred to maintain only one set of controls even on double-ended units. The most important and final major modification was the provision of multiple unit controls for trailing diesel-electric locomotives. This system was designed in-house. It was not uncommon to see several diesel-electric locomotives being led by, and controlled from, one or two Joes (or a set of Boxcabs) in the 1960s and 70s.

The external difference that most readily distinguished class EP-4 from EF-4 was the use of roller bearings on all axles on the E20 and E21 as delivered. The EF-4s were delivered with roller bearings on the forward (unpowered) trucks only, though they would have individual roller bearing axles substituted piecemeal in the shop whenever original plain bearing axles on the motorized sets burned out or were wreck-damaged.

Like almost any locomotive class, the Little Joes were occasionally involved in accidents. One such, in 1966, resulted in the E78 being rebuilt (back east in the Milwaukee Shops) to a slightly different appearance from the other 11 units, due to the replacement of the original GE cabs with that of EMD “Bulldog Nose” cabs and the use of a pair of stainless steel side ventilation grilles intended for use on EMD F-units.

====Usage====

The Milwaukee Road used two for passenger service, designated class EP-4 (2-D+D-2), and the remaining ten for freight, designated class EF-4. They were used on the railroad&#x27;s electrified Rocky Mountain Division in Montana and Idaho to take the place of older GE boxcab electrics that had been operating there since the 1920s. They were never used on the road&#x27;s electrically disjunct Coast Division in Washington, as none of that division&#x27;s substations were upgraded to accommodate them. Three had been delivered in standard gauge, while the rest were converted to standard gauge in the Milwaukee&#x27;s shops.

The EF-4s performed well, so much so that Milwaukee management soon desired to utilize the two EP-4s exclusively on freights. This was being done by 1956, when the passenger Joes were replaced by newly migrated EP-2 Bipolars. After the latter turned out to be ill-suited to the Rocky Mountain Division, they and the EP-4s were replaced by three-unit consists of EMD E-unit and/or FP7 diesels which hauled the &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot; end-to-end, unassisted, until its discontinuation in 1961. Neither EP-4 received the post-1955 Union Pacific-inspired Armour Yellow, red and gray paint scheme used on Milwaukee passenger power, such as the Bipolars and GE Passenger Motors.

The Little Joes lasted until the end of electric operation on the Milwaukee on June 15, 1974. By that time, they were the Milwaukee&#x27;s only electric road locomotives, all the GE Freight Motors (except two which were used together in MU as the Harlowton switcher) having succumbed to old age. One E70 is preserved on display at the Montana Auto Museum in Deer Lodge, Montana.

===South Shore Line===

The South Shore, while primarily a commuter railroad between Chicago, Illinois, and northwestern Indiana, used them in freight service. They were modified to operate on 1500 V DC catenary, and were delivered with roller bearings on all axles as on the Milwaukee EP-4s. In service on the South Shore the &quot;Little Joe&quot; name was not generally used; they were called &quot;800s&quot;. Two of the three lasted until January 1981, making them the last electrics in regular mainline freight service on a US common-carrier railroad. Today, freight trains are pulled by diesel-electric locomotives.

Two 800s survive today, 802 at the Lake Shore Railroad Museum, and 803 in running condition at the Illinois Railway Museum.

===Brazil===
The Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro converted its locomotives to its gauge. They became known as &quot;Russas&quot;, and stayed active through each re-organization of the Brazilian railways, finally ending up with FEPASA in 1971. 

These were the most powerful electric locomotives in the country. On this railway, the locomotive of number 6454 gained the title &quot;Engenheiro Jayme Cintra&quot; - a tribute for an important person of the Paulista Railway history: he was the responsible for electrification of the main Brazilian railway of that season.

They continued to operate until 1999, becoming the last units of their class in revenue service. It was at this point that FEPASA was privatized, and electric operation was ended.

===Milwaukee Road===
Milwaukee #E70 is on static display at Deer Lodge, Montana.

===South Shore===
South Shore #803 is preserved, in operational condition, at the Illinois Railway Museum (IRM). South Shore #802 is preserved and on public display at the Lake Shore Railway Historical Museum in North East, Pennsylvania, away from Erie, where the GE Locomotive Assembly Plant that constructed the Little Joes is located.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, #6451, #6453, #6454, were scrapped after the deactivation. Number 6452 is in a museum in Jundiaí, São Paulo and #6455 is in a museum in Bauru, São Paulo, but is missing many parts. As of 2008, 6455 was transferred in safe for the stop-station gare and now is safe in a rail station-museum.

<text>Gisela Striker (born 1943) is a German classical scholar. She is Professor Emerita of Philosophy and Classics at Harvard University and a specialist in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy.

==Education and career==
Striker was born and educated in Germany, earning her doctorate in philosophy from the University of Göttingen under the supervision of Günther Patzig in 1969 and her Habilitation, also from Göttingen in 1978. She taught philosophy at Göttingen from 1971–1986, and then was professor of philosophy at Columbia University from 1986–1989, and then at Harvard from 1989–1997. In 1997, she became the sixth Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at the University of Cambridge, England, serving until 2000, when she returned to Harvard. She expressed frustration with the ancient philosophy program at Harvard.

==Philosophical work==

Striker specializes in ancient philosophy, teaching Plato and Aristotle, as well as earlier and later Greek and Roman authors. She has written mostly on topics in Hellenistic philosophy (the epistemology and ethics of Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics) and on Aristotelian logic. Her work on Aristotle&#x27;s logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 by Jan Lukasiewicz and reinvigorated in the early 1970s by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley.

<text>Thomas C. Brezina (born 30 January 1963) is an Austrian writer of children&#x27;s books and TV-Presenter. He is especially known for his series, &quot;The Knickerbocker Gang&quot;, &quot;A Case for You and the Tiger-Team&quot; and his stories about the talking bike &quot;Tom Turbo&quot;, as well as for hosting the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Am Dam Des&quot;. He has published over 550 books and his work has been translated into 35 languages.

== Life ==
Brezina was born in Vienna. During his school days Brezina began writing and received the “Grand Austrian Youth Prize” for his screenplays for the TV-puppet-show “Tim, Tom and Dominik”. Subsequently, he worked as a puppeteer alongside , better known as Clown Habakkuk in Austria, and played the magician Tintifax among others.

Brezina wrote bedtime stories and radio plays and finally began working as an assistant director for shows such as &quot;Am Dam Des&quot;, a children&#x27;s program by Austrian national public service broadcaster Österreichischer Rundfunk (ORF). Subsequently, Brezina became a staffer at ORF as editor, director and eventually presenter for children&#x27;s and youth programs.

His breakthrough as a writer occurred in 1990 with the series &quot;The Knickerbocker Gang&quot;. Three years later the book series &quot;Tom Turbo&quot; followed – a detective-series about the “world’s smartest bicycle” – which was later adapted for TV as an interactive children&#x27;s program. Since 2008 Brezina is responsible for the children&#x27;s program &quot;okidoki&quot;, broadcast on ORF eins.

Brezina has received numerous awards for his work, including the “Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria” and the most important Austrian TV award Romy for the educational program &quot;Forscherexpress&quot; (“Researcher’s Express”).

Brezina lives in Vienna and London. Privately he engages in charities for disadvantaged children and became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Austria in 1996. For his 50th birthday he took a children&#x27;s sponsorship for Light for the World and he is currently engaged as a testimonial for Austrian NGO Volkshilfe.

He came out as gay and has been married to Ivo Belajic, a Croatian painter, since 2017.

== Work ==

=== Books ===

Overall Brezina wrote more than 550 books, some of which have been translated into more than 35 languages. With about 40 million sold copies, he is one of the most successful German-language children&#x27;s and youth book authors.
Through his work on a variety of screenplays, Brezina got an offer to write books from German-based Breitschopf-Verlag. His first series was &quot;The Knickerbocker Gang&quot; in 1990 – detective stories about a gang of four kids solving mysteries with brains. The series was also made into a musical, a play, a movie and a television series in 1995 and 1996.

Three years later Brezina created &quot;Tom Turbo&quot;, the &quot;coolest bike in the world&quot;, whose book series and interactive television format is running for 20 years since then. The &quot;Tom Turbo stories&quot; concern a talking bicycle capable of 111 amazing stunts. Together with his two friends, Caro and Claro, and his boss, Thomas Brezina, the bicycle solves mysteries. His main enemy is the purple-clad wannabe supervillain Fritz Fantom.

Other book series followed, such as &quot;No Boys! – Witches Only&quot;, &quot;Pssst! Our Secret! &quot; or &quot;Seven Paws for Penny&quot;. The heroine of the &quot;Penny&quot; books lives on a farm and, in the series&#x27; first title (&quot;What is a dog&#x27;s life, after all?&quot;), saves a dog from being killed. The &quot;seven paws&quot; of the title refers to Penny&#x27;s dogs; one has four white paws and one has three white paws and a black one. His adventure-series &quot;A Case for You and the Tiger-Team&quot; was a big international success, particularly in China, where the series overtook &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in terms of sales numbers at certain points.

The books by Brezina also spawned movies and television-series (for example &quot;The Knickerbocker Gang: The talking tomb&quot; and &quot;Tom Turbo – From 0 to 111&quot;), theatre-plays, musicals (for example &quot;Ritter Rups und der Pirat Kartoffelsalat&quot; (&quot;Knight Rups and captain Potato Salad&quot;)), radio plays and interactive videogames. Furthermore, he was involved in the conception of textbooks for schools, wrote and presented a number of educational videos about famous composers and wrote an interactive series of art books for children (&quot;Museum of Adventures&quot;). The series &quot;A MINI-Case for You and the Tiger-Team&quot; (an adaptation of the Tiger-Team adventures for younger readers) and &quot;Liz Kiss&quot; (a story about a girl becoming a ninja-superheroine) are his latest new works in the field of children&#x27;s books.

=== TV ===

As an author, producer or presenter, Brezina was involved in over 40 TV series and shows for children. His shows, programs and series are mainly featured on Austrian national television broadcaster ORF, but also internationally on TV Educasi, Al Jaazera Children, Arte, DaVinci Learning, Nick, Sat.1 and SuperRTL. For years Brezina wrote the screenplays for the Austrian TV series Helmi, an educational program for kids, which explains dangers and precautions of traffic. He also invented the character of the dog Sokrates, the somewhat clumsy companion of Helmi. Starting as a presenter, Brezina hosted a variety of interactive TV shows and series for the children&#x27;s program of ORF, including &quot;Am Dam Des&quot;, &quot;Die Rätselburg&quot; (Quiz Castle), &quot;Drachenschatz&quot; (Dragon&#x27;s Treasure) and &quot;Forscherexpress&quot; (Researcher&#x27;s Express).

In Austria, one of his most famous TV shows is the detective series &quot;Tom Turbo / Tom Turbo Detective Club&quot;. The interactive show features Tom, a talking bicycle with 111 tricks and young detectives catching clumsy crooks and solving mysteries together with the audience in front of the TV. The series was shot at memorable locations throughout Austria and is still running since the first episode aired in 1993.

In 2008, Brezina and his company Tower10 relaunched the children&#x27;s program of ORF, rebranded it under the name of &quot;okidoki&quot; and are responsible for the program since then. As a part of that, Brezina presented and still presents a couple of formats, most notable &quot;7 Wunder&quot; (7 Wonders), &quot;Trickfabrik&quot; (Trick Factory) and &quot;Genau so geht’s&quot; (That&#x27;s How It Goes).

=== Other projects ===

Besides writing, TV and movies, Brezina stages a variety of events for children, for example the Wien-Detektiv (Vienna-Detective), an educational book-project by the city of Vienna. During the project, kids received free books and were invited to participate in a citywide detective-game.

Together with Gerhard Krammer, Thomas Brezina wrote four musicals for the family-festival Forchtenstein Fantastisch at Castle Forchtenstein in Burgenland, Austria. In them, a small knight named Rups goes on a variety of adventures. The musicals were performed for seven years until now.

The tourist destination Serfaus-Fiss-Ladis offers an adventure trail for children designed by Brezina. This trail, called “Mountain of Adventures” includes three hiking routes on which children can solve puzzles with special detective-equipment.

Brezina has written audio guides for St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna, which describe the history of the cathedral in an adventurous manner suitable for children.

In 2017 Brezina designed the Visitors Area for Vienna International Airport, a multimedia experience for kids as well as adults.

For the Tiergarten Schönbrunn Brezina designed the App &quot;Zoo Adventures by Thomas Brezina&quot;. The app leads the user on various tours like &quot;Thomas Brezina&#x27;s favorite animals&quot; through the zoo and is available for iOS and Android smartphones.

<text>Cool James and Black Teacher (sometimes &quot;Cool James and the Black Teacher&quot;) were a Swedish Eurodance group consisting of Cool James and Black Teacher. The band was formed in Solna, Sweden, and was signed to Stockholm Records.

Their first singles never became big hits, it was not until they released their album &quot;Zooming You&quot; with the single &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; in 1994 that they broke through. It ended as number 21 on the most sold singles list that year and has retained popularity ever since.

James Dandu (&quot;Cool James&quot;), died in a car crash in his native country of Tanzania on August 27, 2002.

<text>A Whitehall rowboat is a style of lapstrake-built rowboat developed in the United States in the 19th century. The basic design is much older and of European ancestry. It strongly resembles a sailing ship&#x27;s gig or a Thames river wherry used by watermen as a taxi service. They were first made in the U.S. at the foot of Whitehall Street in New York City to ferry goods, and people to ships in New York Harbor. 

The boats range from 14 to 22 ft in length, the larger requiring two people to row them. The 25 ft Whitehall gig requires four rowers and a coxswain for a crew of five.

==History==
The Whitehall rowboat was the first boat to be constructed in an inverted-hull set-up to speed up the manufacturing process.

The hull shape is characterized by a nearly straight stem, and slight flare to the bow, rounded sides, with a keel running the entire length of the bottom and a distinctive wine glass transom with a full skeg. Considered one of the most beautiful row-boats, they are designed to handle the harbor chop and yet track straight. Speed was the issue with these boats, as the first to the ship with the goods generally received most of the sales. Later the shore patrol used these boats for customs, police issues, water taxi, and newspaper reporting.

Whitehalls in the early 20th century were a popular recreational boat and were known as the &quot;bicycle of the sea&quot;. A beginning rower finds it easier to row this design in a straight line because of the tracking type keel. Turning requires stronger strokes on one side, and by braking with one oar and pulling with the other the boat can be turned in its own length.

==Today==
Whitehall designs are currently being built in wood, and also manufactured fiberglass usually with wood trims, and more recently thermoformed in co-polymer plastic. These boats are either traditional fixed seat row boats or slide seat rowing boats. Some models or also including sailing rigs. Many designs are mistakenly being called Whitehalls when they are not actually true to the design criteria. The Mystic Seaport Maritime Museum has a comprehensive collection of authentic Whitehall lines.

The Village Community Boathouse in New York City has dedicated its boatbuilding program to almost exclusively building and restoring wooden Whitehall Gigs. They have built dozens over the last decade, most of which are available for free public use at their boathouse on Pier 40 while others have been loaned or donated to sister organizations.

<text>Egerton Dock is a dock at Birkenhead, in England. The dock is situated between East Float and Morpeth Dock, within Birkenhead&#x27;s dock system.

==History==
The dock was the second named as Egerton Dock along the Mersey, the first being the forerunner to Harrington Dock. Named after Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton who laid the foundation stone in October 1844, the dock was completed in 1847. This was just prior to a suspension of the dock scheme, due to a financial crisis affecting the Birkenhead Dock Company.

The dock was originally accessible to shipping from the East Float and via the Morpeth Dock entrance from the River Mersey. Both these passages have since been filled in, making both docks effectively landlocked.

For the majority of its use, it served the LNWR and CLC goods stations which adjoined the dock. The LNWR had a warehouse, on the southern quayside, much used for storing bananas. The dock was partially filled in 1991, removing access from East Float.

== Egerton Bridge ==

Egerton Bridge is situated between Egerton Dock and Morpeth Dock and is a working example of a bascule bridge. It was built between 1928 and 1931, as one of four similar bascule bridges in the Merseyside docks, replacing an earlier swing bridge. The bridge and the machine house were completely restored in 1993 and opened to the public in 1995.

<text>Morpeth Dock is a dock at Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England. The dock is situated between the River Mersey and Egerton Dock.

==History==
Built between 1844 and 1847, it is named after Lord Morpeth, the 7th Earl of Carlisle, who was the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests. The dock was opened in 1847, and the branch dock was built between 1866 and 1868. By 1872, the dock had been significantly remodelled with the branch dock and a canal basin for the GWR&#x27;s goods station. Morpeth Dock Goods station was used by the GWR as the Birkenhead end of cross-river traffic to the Manchester Dock. Morpeth Dock provided berths for the Bibby Line, the Brocklebank Line, Holt and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, all of which worked to the Far East. The branch dock was too small for ships, and was used to site one of the Queensway Tunnel ventilation towers in 1934, along with a water pumping station in 1955. The pumping station later became a water treatment plant, now replacing the entire basin of the branch dock.

Originally, the dock connected directly to the River Mersey via the locks of the Morpeth River Entrance, although the entrance channel has since been partially infilled and the locks removed after being disused for some years. Access to the Great Float via Egerton Dock has also been removed, making both docks effectively landlocked.

The dockside sheds of the former Morpeth Branch Dock were restored around 1992, and contain the Pacific Road Business Centre.

==One O&#x27;Clock Gun==

Situated close to the dock and overlooking the river, the One O&#x27;Clock Gun provided a time signal to shipping on the Mersey. It was fired electrically from Bidston Observatory for the first time on 21 September 1867 and the original cannon was a relic of the Crimean War. Due to the advent of radio and increasing maintenance costs, by 1932 it was proposed to discontinue the One O&#x27;Clock Gun. Although this did not occur, firing was suspended during the Second World War. The tradition ceased altogether on 18 July 1969.

A One O&#x27;Clock Gun is still fired at Edinburgh Castle. 

==Bomb discovery==
Birkenhead docks, as well as the surrounding area, were heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. In May 2006, a 60-year-old, 500 kg (1,102 lb) bomb was discovered by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Northern Diving Group and disposed of by the minesweeper HMS &quot;Atherstone&quot;. It was found embedded in mud in the river, near to the former entrance to Morpeth Dock and may have been disturbed during dredging work at the Twelve Quays ferry terminal. The bomb was later detonated in Liverpool Bay.

<text>The Florida Central Railroad Company is one of several short line railroads run by Regional Rail, LLC. It runs from downtown Orlando northwest to Apopka and Tavares with a branch from Toronto to Ocoee and Winter Garden and branches from Tavares to Umatilla and Sorrento. The Florida Central connects with the Central Florida Rail Corridor in downtown Orlando, Florida and has trackage rights on the CFRC from there south to Taft Yard where they interchange with CSX Transportation. The railroad is based out of the Plymouth freight station.

==History==

The tracks that the Florida Central Railroad operate on were once part of a few independent railroads that were built mostly in the 1880s that were eventually merged into a single system.

===Orlando to Tavares===

The main route of the Florida Central Railroad from Tavares to Orlando was originally built by the Tavares, Orlando and Atlantic Railroad. It was incorporated in 1883, and built as an extension of the Leesburg and Indian River Railroad, which branched off the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad in Wildwood and ran through Leesburg to Tavares. The FC&amp;P leased the line in 1891, which became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1900. This line west of Tavares west was abandoned in the 1970s. A wye on the CSX S Line (former Seaboard main line) near Wildwood Yard is what remains of the connection.

===Tavares to Umatilla===

The Florida Central Railroad branch from Tavares to Umatilla was originally part of the St. Johns and Lake Eustis Railway. This company was chartered in 1879 and was completed in 1882-83. It extended as far north as Astor on the St. Johns River when it was first built. In 1893, the St. Johns &amp; Lake Eustis Railway became part of the Plant System and was converted to standard gauge. The Plant System would become part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902.

===Tavares to Sorrento===

The branch from Tavares to Sorrento was part of the Sanford and Lake Eustis Railway which was completed in 1887. It extended as far east as Sanford when built. The line was immediately leased to the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway, which was part of the Plant System and subsequently, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Track east of Sorrento to Sylvan Lake was abandoned in 1980.

===Toronto to Winter Garden=== 

The branch from Toronto to Winter Garden was built by the Orange Belt Railway from Toronto to Clarcona, and the Florida Midland Railway (not to be confused with Regional Rail, LLC&#x27;s Florida Midland Railroad) from Clarcona to Ocoee. The Orange Belt Railway was completed in 1886 and the Florida Midland Railway was completed around the same time. Those lines would also become part of the Plant System and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. The line from Ocoee to Winter Garden was built by the Tavares and Gulf Railroad, which was a subsidiary of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad.

===Later History===
The Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads merged in 1967 which brought all of the trackage under a single owner, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line&#x27;s parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation.

On November 21, 1986, the newly formed Florida Central Railroad Company, Incorporated leased the lines from CSX from Toronto west and each of the branches. The line from Toronto southeast to Orlando was still run by CSX until September 28, 1990, when the Florida Central Railroad leased the rest of the line from Toronto to the CSX A Line (now the Central Florida Rail Corridor) in Orlando.

On October 1, 1998, an agreement was signed between the railroad and other affected parties to abandon the line between Ocoee and Winter Garden west of Boyd Street, and the line to Diamond R Fertilizer west of 9th St, and build a new connector east of Winter Garden. This would eliminate grade crossings in downtown Winter Garden; trains had to go to the west end of downtown and then reverse direction along the other track to reach Diamond R Fertilizer. As the West Orange Trail was built before this, there is a fence separating it from the former railroad east of downtown Winter Garden.

On November 24, 2003, the Florida Central Railroad was granted an easement for a new connector track in the northwest corner at Toronto. Once this was built, the track crossing the mainline was removed, and the Forest City Branch was abandoned.

Renovations to 57 miles between the CSX connection in Orlando, and the terminus in Umatilla, Florida, began in September, 2013. The $18.4 million project received funding from various counties, the Florida Department of Transportation, FCEN itself, as well as a $2.2 million grant from the Federal Railroad Administration’s Rail Line Relocation program. The upgrades, which include replacing the current track with continuously welded rail, improving the bridge over the Dora Canal, improving grade crossings and tie replacement, as well as increase the speed limit of the line, from 10 mph to 25 mph. Upgrades to the line are in hopes of future commuter rail use, connecting Apopka, Tavares, and Orlando along FCEN track.

In November 2019, former owner Pinsly Railroad Company sold the Florida Central, along with the Florida Midland Railroad and Florida Northern Railroad, to 3i RR Holdings GP, LLC and subsidiaries (d.b.a. &quot;Regional Rail, LLC&quot;).

On October 16, 2023, the Florida Central revealed a new logo and a new paint scheme that is closely based on the Seaboard Coast Line&#x27;s logo and paint scheme.

<text>Amanda Anderson is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Humanities and English and Director of the Cogut Institute for the Humanities at Brown University. She is a literary scholar and theorist who has written on nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature and culture as well as on contemporary debates in literary and cultural theory.

==Career==
Anderson received her Ph.D. from Cornell University, specializing in Victorian literature and contemporary literary, cultural, and political theory. Her work on the Victorian period has focused on the relation between forms of modern thought and knowledge (across both literature and the human sciences) and understandings of selfhood, social life, and ethics.

She taught at the University of Illinois from 1989 until 1999 when she joined Johns Hopkins University. She was Caroline Donovan Professor of English Literature from 2002 to 2012 and the head of the English department from 2003 to 2009. Her graduate teaching included courses on forms of argument in contemporary theory; Victorian internationalism; Victorian realism; and ethics and aesthetics in Victorian literature. She taught undergraduate courses on Jane Austen and Charlotte Brontë, nineteenth-century British fiction, and Victorian poetry and nonfiction prose.

She was Director of the School of Criticism and Theory at Cornell University from 2008 until 2014, when she was appointed Honorary Senior Fellow.

In 2012, she became Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Humanities and English at Brown University. In July 2015, she was appointed as the director of the Cogut Center for the Humanities at Brown University. The Center became an Institute in July 2017.

She delivered the Clarendon Lectures at the University of Oxford in November 2015 under the title &quot;Psyche and Ethos&quot;.

In 2020, she launched the podcast series “Meeting Street: Conversations in the Humanities.”

==Awards==
*2009 Guggenheim Fellowship

== Work ==
In &quot;The Way We Argue Now&quot;, Anderson analyzes a number of influential theoretical debates over the past decade or so, with special attention to the forms of argument that shape work in pragmatism, feminism, cosmopolitanism, and proceduralism.

In her 2012 TedxBrownUniversity talk, Anderson reflects on the &quot;distinctive value of the humanities&quot; and argues that the humanities &quot;open one up to an appreciation and an understanding of the centrality of the questions of value to the human experience.&quot; After Max Weber, she describes the humanities as engaged in a labor of &quot;clarification&quot;: &quot;in assessing works in the humanities, one comes to a better understanding of what one values and how given what one values one can make any number of practical and ethical decisions.&quot;

<text>Natanz () is a city in the Central District of Natanz County, Isfahan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district. It is south-east of Kashan.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 12,060 in 3,411 households. The following census in 2011 counted 12,281 people in 3,829 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 14,122 people in 4,564 households.

==Nuclear facility==
In 2002, the NCRI exposed the existence of an undisclosed uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, leading to concerns about Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. 

Natanz nuclear facility is part of Iran’s nuclear program. It is located some 33 km NNW from the town () near a major highway, is generally recognized as Iran&#x27;s central facility for uranium enrichment with over 19,000 gas centrifuges currently operational and nearly half of them being fed with uranium hexafluoride.

Enrichment of Uranium at the plant was halted in July 2004 during negotiations with European countries. In 2006, Iran announced that it would resume Uranium enrichment. In September 2007, the Iranian government announced it had installed 3 centrifuges at Natanz. In 2010, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was told by the Iranian government that future enrichment programmes would take place at Natanz, and they would start in March 2011.

In January 2013, Fereydoun Abbasi from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said: &quot;five percent uranium enrichment is continuing at Natanz, and we will continue 20 percent enrichment at Fordo and Natanz to meet our needs&quot;.

Daily inspection by the IAEA of the Natanz site was agreed as part of the nuclear enrichment reduction agreement made with the P5+1 countries in November 2013.

On 28 October 2020, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released satellite images acknowledging that Iran had begun the construction of an underground plant near its nuclear facility at Natanz. In March 2021, Iran restarted enriching uranium at the Natanz facility with a third set of advanced nuclear centrifuges in a series of violations of the defunct 2015 nuclear accord. 

===Security incidents===
Natanz&#x27;s nuclear power plant was hit by a sophisticated cyber attack alleged to have been carried out in an operation called Olympic Games by a coalition of German, French, British, American, Dutch and Israeli intelligence organizations. The attack used a Stuxnet worm which hampered the operation of plant&#x27;s centrifuges and caused damage to them over time. The alleged goal of the cyber attack was not to destroy the nuclear program of Iran completely but to stall it enough for sanctions and diplomacy to take effect. This alleged goal was achieved, as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear treaty with Iran was reached in July 2015.

Around 2 a.m. local time on 2 July 2020, a fire and explosion hit a centrifuge production plant at a nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. A group known as the &quot;Cheetahs of the Homeland&quot; claimed responsibility for the attack. Some Iranian officials suggested that the incident may have been caused by cyber sabotage.

On 10 April 2021, Iran began injecting uranium hexafluoride gas into advanced IR-6 and IR- 5 centrifuges at Natanz, but on the next day, an accident occurred in the electricity distribution network. On 11 April, IRNA reported that the incident was due to a power failure and that there were no injuries nor any escape of radioactive material. Reports alleged that Mossad had orchestrated the attack. 

On 17 April, Iranian state television named 43-year-old Reza Karimi from Kashan as a suspect for the blackout, stating that he had fled the country before the sabotage happened.

== Geography ==
===Location===
Natanz is located 120 km northeast of Isfahan and on the main north-south highway of Iran. Its altitude is 1666 meters above sea level. The distance between Tehran and Natanz is 326 km, and it takes about 4 hours by car. The Karkas mountain chain (Kuh-e Karkas) (meaning &quot;mountain of vultures&quot;), at an elevation of 3,899 meters, rises above the town.

===Climate===
The average temperature of the city is 27 degrees Celsius and the average annual rainfall is 195 mm.

== Agriculture ==

<doc id="1146638" wikidata="Q2052676" url="?curid=1146638" title="Raku (programming language)">
<text>Raku is a member of the Perl family of programming languages. Formerly named Perl 6, it was renamed in October 2019. Raku introduces elements of many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl was not a goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. The design process for Raku began in 2000.

==History==
The Raku design process was first announced on 19 July 2000, on the fourth day of that year&#x27;s Perl Conference, by Larry Wall in his &quot;State of the Onion 2000&quot; talk. At that time, the primary goals were to remove &quot;historical warts&quot; from the language; &quot;easy things should stay easy, hard things should get easier, and impossible things should get hard&quot;; and a general cleanup of the internal design and application programming interfaces (APIs). The process began with a series of Request for Comments (RFCs). This process was open to all contributors, and left no aspect of the language closed to change.

Once the RFC process was complete, Wall reviewed and classified each of the 361 requests received. He then began the process of writing several &quot;Apocalypses&quot;, using , &quot;revealing&quot;. While the original goal was to write one Apocalypse for each chapter of &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, it became obvious that, as each Apocalypse was written, previous Apocalypses were being invalidated by later changes. For this reason, a set of Synopses was published, each one relating the contents of an Apocalypse, but with any subsequent changes reflected in updates. Today, the Raku specification is managed through the &quot;roast&quot; testing suite, while the Synopses are kept as a historical reference.

There is also a series of written by Damian Conway that explain the content of each Apocalypse in terms of practical usage. Each Exegesis consists of code examples along with a discussion of the usage and implications of the examples.

There are three primary methods of communication used in the development of Raku today. The first is the Raku Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel on Libera Chat. The second is a set of mailing lists. The third is the Git source code repository hosted at GitHub.

===Initial goals and implications===
The major goal Wall suggested in his initial speech was the removal of historical warts. These included the confusion surrounding sigil usage for containers, the ambiguity between the codice_1 functions, and the syntactic impact of bareword filehandles. There were many other problems that Perl programmers had discussed fixing for years, and these were explicitly addressed by Wall in his speech.

An implication of these goals was that Perl 6 would not have backward compatibility with the existing Perl codebase. This meant that some code which was correctly interpreted by a Perl 5 compiler would not be accepted by a Perl 6 compiler. Since backward compatibility is a common goal when enhancing software, the breaking changes in Perl 6 had to be stated explicitly. The distinction between Perl 5 and Perl 6 became so large that eventually Perl 6 was renamed Raku.

===Mascot===

The language&#x27;s mascot is &quot;Camelia, the Raku bug&quot;.
Her name is a nod to the camel mascot associated with Perl, and her form, in the pun-loving tradition of the Perl community, is a play on &quot;software bug&quot;. Spiral designs embedded in her butterfly-like wings resemble the characters &quot;P6&quot;, the favored nickname for Perl 6, and off-center eye placement is an intentional pun on &quot;Wall-eyed&quot;.

One of the goals behind the lively and colorful design of the logo was to discourage misogyny in the community and for it to be an opportunity for those of &quot;masculine persuasion&quot; to show their sensitive side.

==Implementations==
, only the Rakudo implementation is under active development. No implementation will be designated as the official Raku implementation; rather, &quot;Raku is anything that passes the official test suite.&quot;

Rakudo Perl 6 targets a number of virtual machines, such as MoarVM, the Java Virtual Machine, and JavaScript. MoarVM is a virtual machine built especially for Rakudo and the NQP Compiler Toolchain. There is a layer between Raku and the virtual machines named Not Quite Perl 6 (NQP), which implements Raku rules for parsing Raku, and an abstract syntax tree and backend-specific code generation. Large portions of Rakudo are written in Raku, or in its subset NQP. Rakudo is not a completely self-hosting implementation, nor are there concrete plans at this point to make Rakudo a bootstrapping compiler.

===Historical implementations===
Pugs was an initial implementation of Perl 6 written in Haskell, led by Audrey Tang. Pugs used to be the most advanced implementation of Perl 6, but since mid 2007, it is mostly dormant (with updates made only to track the current version of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)). As of November 2014, Pugs was not being maintained.

In 2007, v6-MiniPerl6 (&quot;mp6&quot;) and its reimplementation, v6-KindaPerl6 (&quot;kp6&quot;) were written as a means to bootstrap the Perl-6.0.0 STD, using Perl 5. The STD is a full grammar for Perl 6 and is written in Perl 6. In theory, anything capable of parsing the STD and generating executable code is a suitable bootstrapping system for Perl 6. kp6 is currently compiled by mp6 and can work with multiple backends. mp6 and kp6 are not full Perl 6 implementations and are designed only to implement the minimum featureset required to bootstrap a full Perl 6 compiler.

Yapsi was a Perl 6 compiler and runtime written in Perl 6. As a result, it required an existing Perl 6 interpreter, such as one of the Rakudo Star releases, to run.

Niecza, another major Perl 6 implementation effort, focused on optimization and efficient implementation research. It targets the Common Language Infrastructure.

==Module system==
The Raku specification requests that modules be identified by name, version, and authority. It is possible to load only a specific version of a module, or even two modules of the same name that differ in version or authority. As a convenience, aliasing to a short name is provided.

CPAN, the Perl module distribution system, does not yet handle Raku modules. Instead a prototype module system is in use.

== Books ==

=== Books published before Perl 6 version 1.0 (known as version 6.c) ===

Also, a book dedicated to one of the first Perl 6 virtual machines, Parrot, was published in 2009.

<doc id="1146648" wikidata="Q7906335" url="?curid=1146648" title="V/Line">
<text>V/Line is a statutory authority that operates regional passenger rail and coach services in the Australian state of Victoria. It provides passenger train services on five commuter routes and eight long-distance services from its major hub at Southern Cross railway station in Melbourne. It also provides coach bus services across Victoria and into New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia. In addition, V/Line is responsible for the maintenance of the Victorian freight and passenger rail network outside of the areas managed by Metro Trains Melbourne and the Australian Rail Track Corporation.

The V/Line brand was introduced after the split-up of VicRail in 1983, and has been used by all successive operators of the state&#x27;s regional public transport network. Until 1999, when its freight operations were privatised, V/Line Freight was also a government provider of the state&#x27;s rail freight services. From 2004 the main operating rail company V/Line Pty Ltd was owned by the V/Line Corporation, a Victorian state government statutory corporation. In 2016, V/Line Corporation became a subsidiary agency of Public Transport Victoria and in July 2021 V/Line transitioned from a government-owned corporation to a statutory authority.

In the 2023–24 financial year, V/Line carried 23.8 million passengers, mostly on its railway lines, which have experienced considerable patronage growth since 2005 due to improved services and population increases. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on usage, with patronage falling to 10.7 million passengers in 2021–22. V/Line&#x27;s operations, particularly those on long-distance routes, remain heavily subsidised by the Victorian Government.

==History==
===As a government authority===
On 1 July 1983, the State Transport Authority and a range of other transport bodies were created, when the Transport Act 1983 came into effect. The new authority replaced VicRail, and established the V/Line operating brand for both country passenger and freight. The VicRail orange and silver &quot;teacup&#x27; livery used on passenger rolling stock was replaced in August 1983 by an orange and grey livery. The white and green V/Line logo was launched on Sunday 21 August 1983 by the transport minister, Steve Crabb, at Spencer Street station, with special trains running to Essendon to mark the occasion. This was altered when on 1 July 1989 the Transport (Amendment) Act took effect, merging the State Transport Authority with the Metropolitan Transit Authority to form the Public Transport Corporation (PTC). The relationship between the country V/Line and suburban &quot;The Met&quot; brands was blurred, with the Sprinter trains delivered in the 1993–1995 period appearing in PTC colours but with both PTC and V/Line logos.&lt;ref name=&quot;V/Linecars&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1984, the first V/Line country coach service commenced with a daily Melbourne to Mildura service being introduced, replacing services formerly operated by Ansett Pioneer and Holidaymakers of Mildura. It was operated under contract by Holidaymakers and Mildura Bus Lines. On 2 December 1984, the &quot;Speedlink&quot; service was introduced. This involved a road coach operating from Adelaide via Albury where it connected with the State Rail Authority&#x27;s &quot;Riverina XPT&quot; to Sydney.

Other new coach services introduced were Warrnambool to Mount Gambier on 19 November 1984, Lang Lang to Inverloch on 9 December 1984, Warrnambool to Ballarat on 3 June 1985, Albury to Mildura and Dandenong to Cowes both on 2 September 1985, and Cobram to Shepparton and Melbourne to Shepparton both on 27 October 1985.

On 27 April 1987, the Canberra Link coach service commenced. A Mylon Motorways coach for Canberra connected with a train service from Melbourne at Wodonga. On the same date a service commenced from Mildura to Broken Hill, connecting off &quot;The Sunraysia&quot;.

On 1 July 1994, the operation of some of V/Line&#x27;s regional passenger services was contracted out to the private sector. Hoys Roadlines took over the Melbourne to Cobram service with trains operated under contract by V/Line to Shepparton with Hoys operating a road coach service beyond. The service from Melbourne to Warrnambool was operated by West Coast Railway who operated their own trains throughout. Both of these returned to being operated by V/Line in 2004.

Passenger rail services to Leongatha ceased on 24 July 1993, Bairnsdale, Cobram and Dimboola on 21 August 1993, Mildura on 13 September 1993 and Ararat on 27 May 1994.

In 1995, the freight and passenger rail divisions of V/Line were divided, with a new red, blue, and white livery for its passenger trains. This split was finalised on 1 July 1997 when separate management was brought in. On 1 July 1998, operation of the Stony Point line passed to Bayside Trains. V/Line continues to lend rolling stock to Metro Trains Melbourne to operate the service.

===Privatisation===
====Freight Victoria====

V/Line Freight was sold to a consortium of RailAmerica, Fluor Daniel, Macquarie Bank and A Goninan &amp; Co and rebranded as Freight Victoria effective from 1 May 1999. The sale included a 45-year lease of most regional track (passenger and freight), with responsibilities for track, signalling and level crossings, with access to passenger sections of track granted to V/Line Passenger. The state government had not wanted to sell rights to the track infrastructure, but was persuaded by bids by three primarily American consortia which argued greater efficiencies could be accomplished by vertical integration.

After being renamed Freight Australia in March 2000, it was sold to Pacific National in August 2004. In May 2007 Pacific National sold the rail lease of the network back to VicTrack.

====National Express====
On 29 August 1999, National Express took control of V/Line Passenger, having won a 10-year concession in competition with FirstGroup, Freight Victoria, GB Railways, Prism Rail and Stagecoach. National Express also operated the M&gt;Tram and M&gt;Train franchises in Melbourne. It included all country rail operations in Victoria, with the exception of the Shepparton and Warrnambool services previously franchised in 1993.

National Express inherited a fleet of A, N, P and Y class locomotives, H, N, S and Z type carriages and Sprinter diesel railcars. As part of the franchise commitment, 29 two-car VLocitys were ordered from Bombardier.

In December 2002, National Express handed in its Victorian rail and tram franchises having been unable to renegotiate financial terms with the State Government. KPMG were appointed to operate the business on behalf of the State Government.

===As a statutory corporation===

Full control of V/Line was taken on 1 October 2003 by changing the shareholding of V/Line, making the government the sole shareholder via a recently created statutory corporation, V/Line Passenger Corporation. V/Line operates under a franchise agreement entered into with the Director of Public Transport. The Director also sub leases tracks and other infrastructure which the Director holds under lease from VicTrack, the agency which owns Victoria&#x27;s rail-related land and infrastructure.

In 2000, the Regional Fast Rail project was launched to upgrade the tracks linking Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne. The project, which also included an extra 10 Vlocitys and an expanded timetable of rail services, commenced full operations from December 2005.

Service to Bairnsdale and Ararat was restored in May and July 2004 respectively. In December 2008, as part of the Victorian Transport Plan, the state government announced that V/Line rail passenger services would be extended from Ballarat to Maryborough at a cost of $50 million, commencing in July 2010. The first passenger train in 15 years arrived at Maryborough on 24 July 2010. V/Line also resumed operating the Shepparton and Warrnambool services in 2004 when contacts with Hoys Roadliners and West Coast Railway expired.

In November 2006, Pacific National, which had purchased Freight Australia, entered into an agreement to sell the remainder of its Victorian rail lease of the network back to VicTrack. The sale was completed on 7 May 2007, with V/Line becoming the track manager of the Victorian intrastate network.

In May 2008, it was announced that part of the V/Line fleet would be converted to standard gauge to operate an upgraded Albury line service. In December 2008 V/Line ended the sale of alcoholic beverages aboard long-distance trains, after almost a century of the practice.

In 2015/16, the subsidy per passenger trip was $22.12.

The Transport Integration Act 2010 renamed the V/Line Passenger Corporation as V/Line Corporation. The Act also gave V/Line a new statutory charter. As part of these changes, the corporation&#x27;s responsibilities were explicitly expanded to cover both rail passenger and rail freight services. The Act received the Royal assent on 2 March 2010 and came into effect on 1 July 2010.

=== Regional Rail Revival ===
In the late 2010s and early 2020s, the V/Line network underwent one of the largest periods of expansion and upgrade in its history. In 2009, work began on the Regional Rail Link, a new double-track railway through Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs designed to separate V/Line and Metro trains and create a new corridor for Geelong corridor trains. Largely funded by the federal Rudd Government in 2009, the project was originally budgeted at $4.32 billion but had a final cost of $3.65 billion. When it opened in 2015, the Deer Park–West Werribee railway line added new V/Line stations in Melbourne&#x27;s west at Tarneit and Wyndham Vale, enabling higher frequencies and expanding V/Line&#x27;s role as a commuter railway service. 

Patronage had been steadily increasing on the V/Line network, growing by 83% between 2006/07 and 2015/16, from 8.9 million to 16.3 million. The Victorian Auditor General found that by 2017 the Regional Rail Link had led to an 80% increase in patronage on the Geelong line.

In January 2016, V/Line&#x27;s VLocity rolling stock was identified as suffering from abnormal wheel wear. The fleet was also banned from the metropolitan track lease by the suburban rail operator, Metro Trains Melbourne, after a V/Line train failed to activate a level crossing in Dandenong. The two problems caused as many as 70 services a day to be cancelled. This also led to the resignation of then CEO Theo Taifalos, 16 days of free travel being provided to Victorians, and a inquiry being ordered by the public transport minister into V/Line&#x27;s operational capacity. It was later identified that the wheel wear was caused by harsh curves in track segments, particularly along the Dynon-North Melbourne flyover, which was rebuilt as part of the Regional Rail Link. As a result, the flyover track segment was replaced, and permanent speed restrictions were introduced from the flyover to South Kensington.

In 2017, the State Government under Premier Daniel Andrews initiated work on the Regional Rail Revival program, a $4 billion project to upgrade Victoria&#x27;s regional railways and provide more reliable and frequent passenger services. The program was co-funded by the Federal Government, through the Commonwealth&#x27;s asset-recycling fund. The project reflected the upgrades outlined in the 2016 Regional Network Development Plan.

The project involved upgrades to all of the state&#x27;s regional rail corridors. The project allocated $518 million for upgrades to the Ballarat line, including of duplicated track between Deer Park West and Melton stations, new passing loops, new train stabling, upgraded stations and more car parking along the corridor. A new platform and track was added to Waurn Ponds station on the Geelong line and a rail line to Armstrong Creek was investigated. The Gippsland line will have its signalling upgraded, some track duplicated, a new stabling facility built and platforms added to some stations. The North East, Shepparton and Warrnambool lines were upgraded to allow VLocity trains to run on those corridors. 

The project will also include track speed and signalling upgrades to the Bendigo-Echuca line. Secondary stages of upgrades were launched on many lines, allowing more services to be added. A new rail bridge was built over the Avon River in Gippsland as part of the project. New stations were built at Goornong, Huntly and Raywood on the Bendigo line as part of the Bendigo Metro project, which aimed to improve the commuter service for greater Bendigo. A new Cobblebank station east of Melton was opened in 2019.

Over this time, the VLocity became the primary rollingstock servicing the V/Line network, with 105 three-car sets in service as of 2023. VLocity trains were introduced to a standard gauge line for the first time in July 2022 after upgrades to the Seymour and Albury lines as part of the Regional Rail Revival. During the 2022 state election, the Andrews government promised to purchase a further 23 three-car sets for the network. The government also announced new stations for the Regional Rail Link at Truganina and Tarneit West, and the removal of four more level crossings on the Ballarat line around Melton, which would make the line level-crossing free between the city and Melton. 

In the 2023/24 Victorian Budget, 23 new 3-car VLocity trains were ordered as part a $601 million investment in order to replace ageing Classic Fleet trains, boosting Victoria’s VLocity fleet to 141 trains once construction is completed.

On 1 July 2021, V/Line transitioned from a state-owned corporation to a statutory authority.

==Services==

V/Line operates rail services to the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Seymour, Traralgon, Ararat, Maryborough, Echuca, Swan Hill, Albury, Bairnsdale, Warrnambool and Shepparton. In addition, V/Line coach buses connect with many rail services at major stations to serve towns located away from the passenger rail network.

Rail services are grouped into two types. As part of the introduction of the Myki smartcard in 2013, and to provide consistent communication to both staff and customers, what were formerly called &quot;interurban&quot; services became &quot;commuter&quot; services, and what were formerly called &quot;intercity&quot; services became &quot;long distance&quot; services. 

Commuter services operate over shorter distances and significantly more frequently than long-distance services, and use two different ticketing systems. Commuter services use the Myki, whilst long distance services require printed paper tickets. 

Commuter services consist of the Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Gippsland and Seymour lines. Long-distance services extend beyond to Albury, Ararat, Bairnsdale, Echuca, Maryborough, Shepparton, Swan Hill and Warrnambool.

All rail services depart from Southern Cross station in Melbourne with the exception of the Traralgon service which departs/ terminates at Flinders Street.
*South West Region or Geelong Line which continues as the Warrnambool Line
*Western Region or Ballarat Line which continues as the Ararat Line and the Maryborough Line
*Northern Region or Bendigo Line which extends as the Swan Hill Line and the Echuca Line
*North East Region or Seymour Line which extends as the Shepparton Line and the Albury Line
*Eastern Region or Bairnsdale Line

V/Line also runs numerous intrastate and interstate road coach services that may run wholly as a coach service or operate as a coach connecting with a rail service.

Interstate road coach service operated by V/Line are:
*Canberra Link – Melbourne (Southern Cross) to Canberra via Wodonga, runs as a train to Albury and then a coach to Canberra
*Capital Link – Melbourne (Southern Cross) to Canberra via Bairnsdale, runs as a train to Bairnsdale and then a coach to Canberra
*Daylink – Melbourne (Southern Cross) to Adelaide via Bendigo, runs as a train to Bendigo and then a coach to Adelaide 6 days a week and as a coach the whole way on Sunday.
*Sapphire Coast Link – Melbourne (Southern Cross) to Batemans Bay via Bairnsdale, runs as a train to Bairnsdale and then a coach to Batemans Bay
*Speedlink – Sydney to Adelaide via Albury. This operates as the NSW TrainLink XPT train from Sydney to Albury with a V/Line coach operating from Albury to Adelaide.
*Murraylink – Mildura to Albury, does not travel to Melbourne and operates entirely as a coach.

==Ticketing==
===Tickets===
V/Line currently uses the myki electronic ticketing system on its commuter train services, in addition to printed paper tickets, issued from staffed V/Line stations, selected Metro suburban premium stations, V/Line ticket agents, online or by phone. Passengers boarding services at unmanned stations or coach stops can purchase tickets from the train conductor or coach driver. V/Line also offers eTickets which can be bought online and can be used in place of paper tickets.

Ticket types available include single, return, and various periodical tickets. Until 2023, services used to be classified as peak and off-peak, with discounts available for tickets valid in off-peak times only. From June 2013, the myki smartcard system began to be rolled out on the V/Line network. , myki ticketing is only used between Melbourne and the following stations: Waurn Ponds (in Geelong), Wendouree (in Ballarat), Raywood and Goornong (in Bendigo), Traralgon and Seymour. Further out, paper tickets are still required. A paper ticket that costs at least the daily cap ($10.60 on weekdays and $7.20 on weekends and public holidays, ) also allows additional travel in the myki network on the same day without using a myki card.

Most V/Line services operate on a non-allocated seating basis, but all intercity (long-distance) rail services, and some coach services, require seat reservations.

=== Fares ===
Tickets have the origin and destination printed upon them, making them point to point, but the fare itself is based on charging zones. Changes had been made to the fare system, to integrate it with the suburban Metcard system in preparation for the introduction of the Myki smartcard system to cover the entire state.

Until the introduction of the fare cap in March 2023, a single V/line economy fare could range up to $68.60 (March 2023 cost), and $137.20 for a daily economy fare. A limited number of V/Line services also had first class seating which required the payment of an upgrade fee (up to $8.60 in March 2023) on top of the standard economy fare. During the 2022 state election, the Victorian government promised to cap all V/Line fares to $9.20 for daily travel and $4.60 for concession card holders, regardless of distance travelled. This would make V/Line fares cost the same as a daily fare for travel with Metropolitan Melbourne, and represented the largest cut in fares in the system&#x27;s history. The differentiation between economy class and first class seating, as well as the upgrade fee for first class seating, would also be abolished. A daily peak fare from Bendigo would be cut from $68.80 to $9.20, while Ballarat would be cut from $45.60 and Geelong from $27.60. An overnight trip to Swan Hill would be cut from a total cost of $92 to $18.40, as it requires two daily fares.

In early 2023, the state government announced the changes would take effect on 31 March 2023. The weekend and public holiday daily cap of $6.70 also took effect. However, the fare cap only applied to travel within the state and to interstate within from the Victorian border. Single fares for interstate travel further than from the border were still reduced, with a daily interstate surcharge of $21.80 applied to a single daily fare, for a reduced maximum total daily fare of $31.

Concerns were raised by public transport advocates that the system would struggle to cope with the expected increase in patronage from the fare cap, particularly during off-peak times and weekends. During the election the government promised an extra 23 new VLocity trains and an increase in weekend V/Line frequencies, but these were not expected until 2024. In the first week of the new fare system, the V/Line network carried 420,000 passengers.

, the daily fare cap is $10.60, $5.30 for concession card holders, and the weekend and public holiday cap is $7.20. The daily interstate surcharge for interstate travel further than from the Victorian border is $24.60, for a maximum total of $35.20 for a single daily fare.

===Coaches===

Coach services are provided by 23 private companies including BusBiz, Dineen Group, Donric Group, Dysons, Firefly Express, Mee&#x27;s Bus Lines, Panorama Coaches and Ventura Bus Lines, which are contracted by Public Transport Victoria to operate services for V/Line. These coaches are painted in V/Line livery.

==Network access==
V/Line is also responsible for managing and maintaining all non-interstate rural rail track in Victoria, including lines that do not see any passenger services.

==Branding==

The initial V/Line visual identity was unveiled in August 1983, with an orange and grey livery for locomotives and passenger rolling stock, along with a white and green V/Line logo with a &quot;stylised capital lettered logo with the V and the L split by a deep slashing stroke&quot;. Work on the initial V/Line identity started in May 1983, with freight wagons being released without logos pending the launch. Before that time, a stylised VR logo was carried by rolling stock that had been received the orange and silver VicRail &quot;teacup&quot; livery since 1981. Carriages in the &#x27;teacup&#x27; livery later had the logos removed and replaced by V/Line ones.

This remained until 1993 when the Sprinter railcars were delivered in the teal and yellow suburban &#x27;The Met&#x27; brand colours, but with both The Met and V/Line logos. In 1995, the freight and passenger rail divisions of V/Line were divided, with locomotives in the freight fleet retaining the orange and grey livery with &#x27;V/Line Freight&#x27; logos, while passenger carriages and locomotive received the red blue and white &#x27;V/Line Passenger&#x27; livery which remains on some of the fleet today. It was also at that time that the V/Line logo was altered, with serifs added to the lettering, and the &quot;deep slashing stroke&quot; was altered to a curved blue line. After National Express took over V/Line, the logo was again altered in 2000, with mixed-case lettering and a curving blue line underneath. In 2006, it was again altered, with the removal of the blue line underneath and addition of a purple line.
The VLocity trains were delivered from 2005 in a new livery of stainless steel with purple and green highlights. In 2007, a new livery was unveiled, consisting of a grey carbody with red, white and purple stripes. Rolling stock in different variants of the livery was released throughout that year, with a consistent version not appearing until 2008, along with a number of repainted locomotives.

In 2013, a Public Transport Victoria (PTV) livery of purple and white diamonds was adopted, and was progressively applied to V/Locitys and road coaches. This livery matches the geometric designs seen on other PTV services, and uses purple in keeping with the designation of regional services with purple branding. In early 2017, locomotive N457 was re-painted with a version of the PTV livery, and Set SN 8 was re-painted to match the new livery of the V/Locity fleet. Almost all of V/Line&#x27;s rolling stock have since received this purple livery, with some Sprinter sets still bearing the old livery, such as Sprinter 7003 in May 2023 and Sprinter 7005 in July 2023.

==Sponsorships==
Since 2004, V/Line has been the naming rights sponsor of the Australian Football League&#x27;s Victorian country competition for junior players. The V/Line Cup is played over several days in September and includes two boys&#x27; divisions and one girls&#x27; division.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFL V/Line Cup&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
V/Line published an in-house magazine. It replaced &quot;VicRail News&quot;, initially being published as &quot;STA News&quot; then &quot;V/Line News&quot; from December 1983 until February 1991.

<text>The Flirtations (previously The Gypsies) are an all-female musical group who have recorded since the early 1960s.

==History==
In 1962 in New York City, Lestine Johnson and sisters Ernestine Pearce, Shirley Pearce and Betty Pearce from South Carolina formed The Gypsies. In 1964 they signed to Old Town Records, where they released their debut single &quot;Hey There, Hey There&quot;. The song achieved airplay only on local radio stations, but their next single — the J.J. Jackson-written &quot;Jerk It&quot; — was more successful, reaching #111 (pop) and #33 (R&amp;B) in the spring of 1965. Despite the relative success of &quot;Jerk It&quot;, Lestine Johnson left the group, replaced by Viola Billups. The Gypsies released only two singles on Old Town Records in 1966, giving them a total of four.

That year, now on Josie Records, the four women renamed themselves The Flirtations and released the well-regarded northern soul dancer &quot;Change My Darkness Into Light&quot;. It was ignored by DJs and sales suffered. The quartet then moved to the Jamie-Guyden distributed label Festival Records, where they released &quot;Stronger Than Her Love&quot; and &quot;Settle Down&quot; as a single, which failed to spark much interest.
Betty Pearce left the group, reducing the Flirtations to a trio. After winning a small local talent contest in 1968 to see who could sound the most like the Supremes, they packed their bags and headed for England, where they signed to the Parrot label and in the fall of 1968 supported the label&#x27;s star act Tom Jones on his European tour. The Flirtations&#x27; sole Parrot release was &quot;Someone Out There&quot;, backed with &quot;How Can You Tell Me?&quot; &quot;Someone Out There&quot; rose to second place on the &quot;Bubbling Under&quot; list in September 1968, and the track did afford the Flirtations a chart hit in the Netherlands with a No. 25 peak.
In late 1968 the trio signed with Deram Records and released what would become their signature recording, &quot;Nothing But A Heartache&quot; — a dense, dynamic, earth-shattering melodrama produced by Englishman Wayne Bickerton and written by Bickerton with Tony Waddington. The B-side was a Christmas song, &quot;Christmastime Is Here Again&quot;. &quot;Nothing But a Heartache&quot; rose to first place on the &quot;Bubbling Under&quot; list in December 1968 and gave the Flirtations a second Top 40 hit in the Netherlands, reaching No. 36 in early 1969. On the success of those singles in March 1969 they embarked on an 18 date tour of the UK with Stevie Wonder and The Foundations.

Following an unsuccessful December 1968 US release, &quot;Nothing But a Heartache&quot; was re-issued in the US in early 1969, with &quot;How Can You Tell Me?&quot; now replacing the original seasonal B-side. &quot;Nothing But a Heartache&quot; debuted at No. 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 8 March 1969. The single reached the Top 20 in several US markets – its chart peak in Boston was No. 3 – but the staggered regional success indicated by its 14-week Hot 100 run dictated that its national peak – achieved on the 24 May 1969 Hot 100 – would be No. 34. (The &quot;Cash Box&quot; singles chart peak for &quot;Nothing But a Heartache&quot; was No. 31.) Somewhat reminiscent of mid-1960s Supremes – particularly &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; – the single is now generally regarded as a pop and Northern soul classic.
The follow-up was less of a dance tune than the previous single. &quot;South Carolina&quot; was a ballad that reached only No. 111 pop in July 1969. In 1970, &quot;Keep On Searching&quot; was released and did nothing. However, this may have been due to confusion over whether the newest single was &quot;Searching&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s Good About Goodbye My Love&quot;. The latter peaked at No. 17 R&amp;B in early 1970, but failed to make a dent in the pop charts. In July 1970 the trio scored another hit with another Bickerton and Waddington song, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;. The song made No. 96 in &quot;Cash Box&quot;. The same year, Tom Jones also released a version of the song that reached US AC No. 3 and CAN AC No. 5.


1971 saw their sixth and last Deram single, &quot;Give Me Love&quot; (not the George Harrison song). Not originally in their 1970 LP &quot;Sounds Like the Flirtations&quot;, but subsequently added to their 2008 CD version, it did not do well in the charts. The rest of their singles were not released in the U.S. Misty Browning, from Texas, replaced Viola Billups in 1972. Viola Billups embarked on a solo career as Vie and as Pearly Gates. Browning was followed by Loretta Noble. During 1972, the group were the resident vocal band on the long running BBC TV series &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard&quot;, backing Cliff Richard on various numbers, performing their own songs and supporting other guests on the show.

Throughout the 1970s the Flirtations released material on various labels. Polydor titles in 1971 and 1972 included &quot;Little Darling (I Need You)&quot;, &quot;Take Me In Your Arms (&amp; Love Me)&quot;, &quot;Hold On To Me Babe&quot; and &quot;Love A Little Longer&quot;. In 1973, their Mojo Records releases included &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t I Think of That&quot;. In 1975 it was RCA&#x27;s turn: &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, &quot;Mr. Universe&quot;, and &quot;One Night of Love&quot;, which gained enough sales and airplay for another LP, &quot;Love Makes the World Go Round&quot;, just before 1976. 
The Flirtations recorded Hi-NRG tracks such as &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1983), &quot;Read All About It&quot; (1986) and &quot;Back On My Feet Again&quot; (1989), the latter reuniting Viola with the Pearce sisters. The track became a major hit in South Africa in 1984 reaching No. 6.

The band were rediscovered in the disco and Northern soul circuits of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the U.S. In the UK &quot;Nothing But A Heartache&quot; was used in an advertising campaign for KFC and, in 2007, was covered by The Freemasons. Ernestine Pearce can be seen at various venues along with Clem Curtis and Jimmy James as part of &quot;The Soul Explosion&quot; tour.

With Ian Levine forming his label Centre City Records, 2007, the ladies recorded regularly for the label compilations. In 2009, they released their first single in 20 years, &quot;Roulette&quot;, produced by Soren Jensen for Night Dance Records, including mixes and a music video. The track peaked at No. 10 in &quot;Music Week&quot;&#x27;s Commercial Pop Club Chart by December 2009.

<text>In the context of the Spanish Empire, a peninsular (, pl. &quot;peninsulares&quot;) was a Spaniard born in Spain residing in the New World, Spanish East Indies, or Spanish Guinea. In the context of the Portuguese Empire, reinóis (singular &quot;reinol&quot;) were Portuguese people born in Portugal residing primarily in Portuguese America; children born in Brazil to two &quot;reinóis&quot; parents were known as .

Spaniards born in the Spanish Philippines were called &quot;insular/es&quot; or, originally, &quot;filipino/s&quot;, before &quot;Filipino&quot; now came to be known as all of the modern citizens of the now sovereign independent Philippines. Spaniards born in the colonies of the New World that today comprises the Hispanic America are called &quot;criollos&quot; (individuals of full Spanish descent born in the New World).

Higher offices in Spanish America and the Spanish Philippines were held by &quot;peninsulares&quot;. Apart from the distinction of &quot;peninsulares&quot; from &quot;criollo&quot;, the &quot;castas&quot; system distinguished also &quot;mestizos&quot; of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry in the Americas, and &#x27;&quot;mestizos de español&quot;&#x27; (mixed Spanish and native Filipino (Spanish Filipino)), or &quot;&#x27;tornatrás&quot;&#x27; (mixed Spanish and Sangley Chinese (Chinese Filipino)) in the Philippines / Spanish East Indies, &quot;mulatos&quot; (of mixed Spanish and black ancestry), &quot;indios&quot; (Amerindians / Native Filipinos), &quot;zambos&quot; (mixed Amerindian and black ancestry) and finally &quot;negros&quot;. In some places and times, such as during the wars of independence, &quot;peninsulares&quot; or members of conservative parties were called depreciatively &quot;godos&quot; (meaning &quot;Goths&quot;, referring to the &quot;Visigoths&quot;, who had ruled Spain and were considered the origin of Spanish aristocracy) or, in Mexico, &quot;gachupines&quot;. &quot;Godos&quot; is still used pejoratively in the Canary Islands for the peninsular Spanish, and in Chile for Spaniards.

<doc id="1146655" wikidata="Q42682" url="?curid=1146655" title="Geoffroy's cat">
<text>Geoffroy&#x27;s cat (Leopardus geoffroyi) is a small wild cat native to the southern and central regions of South America. It is around the size of a domestic cat. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List due to it being widespread and abundant over its range.

==Taxonomy==
Geoffroy&#x27;s cat is named after the 19th century French zoologist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844). It was identified as &quot;Felis geoffroyi&quot; in 1844 by French naturalists Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny and Paul Gervais on the basis of three specimens that d&#x27;Orbigny had collected on the banks of the Rio Negro in Patagonia during his travels in South America between 1826 and 1833. Five subspecies have been described based on geographic dispersement:
*&quot;L. g. geoffroyi&quot;: Central Argentina
*&quot;L. g. euxantha&quot;: Northern Argentina, Western Bolivia
*&quot;L. g. leucobapta&quot;: Patagonia
*&quot;L. g. paraguae&quot;: Paraguay, Southeastern Brazil, Uruguay, Northern Argentina
*&quot;L. g. salinarum&quot;: Northwestern and Central Argentina

Since 2017, Geoffroy&#x27;s cat is considered a monotypic species.

Genetic studies have shown that Geoffroy&#x27;s cat is most closely related to the kodkod.

==Characteristics==
The Geoffroy&#x27;s cat is about the size of a domestic cat, but has numerous black spots and dark bands on the cheeks, head and neck as well as on the tail and limbs. The background colour of its fur varies from a brownish-yellow coat in the northern part of its range to a more grayish coat in the south. The underbelly hair is cream-coloured or even white. The backs of the ears are black with white spots. Black individuals are common.

Its size is about in head and body with a relatively short tail of about . It weighs between , though individuals up to have been reported. Males are usually larger than females, and Geoffroy&#x27;s cat in the south are larger than those from the north.
It has a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 106.3.

== Distribution and habitat==
The Geoffroy&#x27;s cat is distributed in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. It inhabits pampas and savanna landscapes in the Gran Chaco from southern Bolivia to the Straits of Magellan ranging at elevations from sea level up to in the Andes. It prefers open woodland or scrubland with plenty of cover, but also occurs in grasslands and marshy areas. It is thought to be rare in Chile.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
The Geoffroy&#x27;s cat is nocturnal and a solitary hunter that contacts conspecifics only during the mating season. Geoffroy&#x27;s cats have been observed to stand up on their hind legs to scan the surrounding landscape and use their tail as a support, an unusual behaviour among cats. It is able to climb trees but rarely does, except to leave faeces to scent mark its territory.
It preys primarily on rodents, hares, other small mammals, birds, snakes, small lizards, insects, and occasionally frogs and fish. Females maintain home ranges about in size, while males range over up to .

===Reproduction===
The breeding season for Geoffroy&#x27;s cats lasts from October to March. During this time, the female comes into estrus for periods of up to twelve days, between three and five weeks apart. Mating during this time is brief and frequent, often taking place on a high ledge or similar site.

Gestation lasts for 72–78 days. Most births occur between December and May. Litters consist of one to three kittens, and one or two is more common.

The kittens are born blind and helpless, weighing about , and develop rather slowly compared to the domestic cat. The eyes open after eight to nineteen days, and they begin to eat solid food at six or seven weeks. Kittens become independent of their mother at around eight months, but are generally not sexually mature until 18 months for females and 24 months for males.

==Conservation==
From the 1960s to the 1980s, Geoffroy&#x27;s cats were hunted extensively for their pelts for the international fur trade, but little trade took place after 1988 and the species was upgraded to CITES Appendix I status in 1992.
Legislation introduced in the late 1980s made hunting and domestic trade of Geoffroy&#x27;s cat&#x27;s pelts illegal in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. International trade in Cites Appendix I listed species is now prohibited, except for non-commercial purposes.

<text>Alfred Dock is a dock at Birkenhead, Merseyside, England. The dock covers an area of and provides access to the Great Float from the River Mersey.

==History==

In 1856, J. B. Hartley produced plans for alternative river access to the Great Float, as the Great Low Water Basin proved to be insufficient. Completed in 1866, the dock was named after Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, second son of Queen Victoria, and opened by him on 21 June 1866.

Designed to replace the Great Low Water Basin, the dock was originally constructed with three lock entrances from the river of , and , and three passages onwards to the Great Float. This provided much expanded access to the Birkenhead dock system, which was also served by an entrance channel further south via Morpeth Dock.

In order to accommodate larger vessels, the and lock entrances and passages were combined into an system and deepened, between 1926-9. This meant the removal of a river lock entrance and an access channel to the Great Float, in order to reconstruct the remaining facilities. At the same time, a bascule bridge and a swing bridge were constructed over two remaining passages. The dock was arranged so that the whole dock could be used as a lock.

By the beginning of the 1980s, the remaining southern lock entrance had closed and was partly filled in. The redevelopment of Tower Road over a decade later precipitated in the removal of the swing bridge and the sealing up of the southern passage.

The north quayside of Alfred Dock was an open quay. The southern quayside was unallocated.

==Present==
Of the existing two river entrances, only the north locks remain operational. Tower Road, which links Birkenhead with the Seacombe area of Wallasey, divides Alfred Dock from the Great Float via a bascule bridge. This bridge is the last remaining of the former Four Bridges which crossed the dock system at this point.

<text>The National Transport Workers&#x27; Federation (NTWF) was an association of British trade unions. It was formed in 1910 to co-ordinate the activities of various organisations catering for dockers, seamen, tramwaymen and road transport workers.

==History==
The NTWF had some success as an organisational tool and as a symbol of trade union unity, but since its member unions retained full control over their own affairs it was not always able to have a direct influence on trade disputes. One of its members William Ball, was the subject of a pamphlet &quot;&#x27;Torture in an English Prison&quot;&#x27; about his treatment as a male union supporter of women&#x27;s right to vote in 1911. In 1912, it called a National Dock Strike in support of London dockers which was observed only in a few centres, and which ended within a week. This was regarded as an embarrassing setback, and led the Federation to adopt a more cautious approach in subsequent years. In 1921 it was criticised for failing to bring out its members in support of the miners in the Black Friday crisis.

The NTWF laid the foundations for the creation of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) in 1922. The TGWU initially affiliated, but left in 1923, and the federation accomplished little thereafter, dissolving in 1927.

<doc id="1146683" wikidata="Q5865037" url="?curid=1146683" title="History of Jewish education in the United States before the 20th century">
<text>The history of Jewish education in the United States before the 20th century is as old as the United States itself; it is a part of overall U.S. Jewish history.

That history begins early in the history of the first Jewish congregation in New York. Attached to that congregation was a school in which secular as well as Hebrew subjects were taught. It was one of the earliest general schools in America; poor children received tuition-free instruction.

Religious instruction was established in connection with most of the early synagogues. For ordinary secular education American Jews resorted, in large measure, to the nonsectarian schools and colleges. There was a Jewish matriculate at the University of Pennsylvania, for instance, as early as 1772. The older communities, however, before the general establishment of the public school system, frequently provided regular instruction in secular subjects. These schools ordinarily were adjuncts of the religious schools maintained by the congregations.

In Philadelphia as early as 1838 a general Sunday school, without congregational affiliation, was established, largely through the efforts of Rebecca Gratz, who was its superintendent and president until 1864. This was the beginning of a movement, which has spread throughout the country, for the organization of educational work along lines quite independent of congregational activities.

==Free Schools==
A similar school was organized in Charleston, South Carolina in the same year; in the following year, one in Richmond, Virginia; in 1845 this movement spread to New York, being taken up first by the Emanu-El Society, although the Shearith Israel congregation had started a Hebrew-school system as early as 1808. In 1848 the Hebrew Education Society was founded at Philadelphia—originally a school for general instruction in the ordinary branches up to and through the grammar-school grade, together with instruction in Hebrew and in the Jewish religion.

In 1864 the Hebrew Free School Association was incorporated in New York; and throughout various states of the Union a movement gradually spread for the organization of free religious schools which would bring into a common-school system children from the various congregations in each city. These were largely intended to supersede the private institutions that had hitherto existed. They were, in the main, carried on by volunteer teachers; and their distinguishing feature was that the instruction was usually conducted by native-born persons and in the English language, as against the German teaching in the congregational schools.

==Technical Schools==
The whole trend of this educational work was toward the unification of the community and the broadening of the interests of the individual members, with a tendency to overcome the narrowness of the congregational life that had prevailed, wherein Religious schools and Sabbath-schools have been organized in connection with individual congregations. Particular stress is laid upon them by the congregations, which derive from them much of their communal strength. While many of the Hebrew education societies and schools continue in existence, they do not develop or flourish as might be expected; in fact, since 1882 they have largely taken upon themselves an entirely new function. With the sudden arrival in the United States of a large number of Russian Jews having no knowledge of the English language, and in many cases without any particular handicraft, there devolved upon the American Jewish community the necessity of providing
*day- and night-schools for teaching English to the new arrivals, and
*manual-training and technical schools.

These have been established in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and other cities, more or less with the aid of the Baron de Hirsch Fund. The most noteworthy of these educational institutions called into existence since the Russian immigration began is the Educational Alliance of New York.

==Theological Institutions==

Until recently provision for higher education on specifically Jewish lines was not found practicable, though as early as 1840 the versatile and suggestive Mordecai M. Noah urged the formation of a Jewish college in the United States. His project met with no response. Nor was I. M. Wise more successful when in 1855 he endeavored to establish a theological college in Cincinnati under the name of &quot;Zion Collegiate Institute.&quot;

In 1867 the scholarly and enterprising Isaac Leeser, however, established Maimonides College at Philadelphia. It was intended that general collegiate instruction should be provided there, though naturally the Jewish branches were to be given particular attention. A certain measure of cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania was planned, and the idea held in mind was that the college should serve as the capstone to the scheme of education built by the Hebrew Education Society. The college was, however, much ahead of the times, and after a few years of languishing life passed out of existence.

Not until nearly twenty years thereafter was the first institution for the training of rabbis and teachers founded. This was the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati, established in 1875 by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, an organization created at that time for the purpose, and mainly at the instance of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise. The existence of the college has been continuous, and, though theoretically without partisan bias, it is practically the representative of the Reform wing in America. Graduates from this institution are to be found in charge of congregations in nearly every city of importance in the country. Rev. Dr. K. Kohler is president (1905), and there is a faculty of ten professors and several instructors.

In 1886 there was established in New York the Jewish Theological Seminary, also for the training of rabbis and teachers, and representing the Orthodox wing of the community. The reorganization which this institution underwent in 1901-2 resulted in the calling of Dr. S. Schechter to its presidency. At the same time it was richly endowed, and in 1903 took possession of a new building, the gift of Jacob H. Schiff. Its library, largely the gift of Judge Mayer Sulzberger, contains one of the greatest collections of Hebraica.

In 1895, through a trust vested by Hyman Gratz of the Congregation Mikveh Israel, Gratz College was founded in Philadelphia, which is devoted to the preparation of teachers for Jewish schools. The first President of Gratz College is the famous Jewish educator, Moses Aaron Dropsie.

The largest sum ever made available for the promotion of Semitic investigation is that bequeathed in 1905 by Moses A. Dropsie of Philadelphia for the establishment of a Jewish college along broad lines, for instruction &quot;in the Hebrew and cognate languages and their respective literatures, and in the rabbinical learning and literature.&quot; The amount of this bequest is about $800,000.

Throughout the United States there have been established in connection with the various congregations, and also independently, Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Associations (YMHA) and other societies which are to a certain extent educational in their character. They usually maintain small libraries and provide lecture-courses on secular and religious topics.

In 1893 there was founded the Jewish Chautauqua Society, which has branches all over the country and bears the same relation to the regular schools and colleges as does the University Extension movement, as interpreted in America, to regular colleges for university work.

The Council of Jewish Women has engaged to a considerable extent in educational work among its own members. In 1886 the Reform wing of American Jewry organized at Cincinnati a Hebrew Sabbath-School Union for the purpose of promoting uniformity and approved methods in Sabbath-school instruction.

As of 1900, there were in the United States 415 Jewish educational organizations, 291 of which were religious schools attached to congregations, with 1,127 teachers and an attendance of about 25,000 pupils. There were also 27 Jewish free schools, chiefly in large cities, with about 11,000 pupils and 142 teachers.

<text>The history of the [[Jews]] in [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial America]] begins upon their arrival as early as the 1650s. The first Jews who came to the New World were Sephardi Jews who arrived in New Amsterdam (New York City). Later major settlements of Jews would occur in the port cities: Newport, Philadelphia, Charleston, and Savannah.

The Jewish settlers immediately faced discrimination, similar to and often more intense than that suffered by other religions, Catholics, Lutherans, and Quakers. The Jewish settlers played a role in the trading business of the colonies, but were often faced with anti-Jewish discrimination from both governmental entities and individuals. 
==Early individual arrivals==

===Joachim Gans===
Joachim Gans was a Bohemian-German Jew born in Prague, Kingdom of Bohemia. Gans was a renowned metallurgist and mining expert, who was recruited by Sir Walter Raleigh for the 1585 expedition to found a permanent settlement in the Virginia territory, which became the Roanoke Colony.

===Elias Legarde===
Elias Legarde (or Legardo) was a Sephardic Jew who arrived at Jamestown, Virginia on HMS &quot;Abigail&quot; in 1621. Legarde arrived in the muster of Anthonie Bonall. Legarde was from Languedoc, France, and was hired to go to the colony to teach people how to grow grapes for wine. In 1628 Legarde leased 100 acres on the west side of Harris Creek in Elizabeth City, Colony of Virginia.

===Solomon Franco===
One of the first Jews known to have lived in northern North America was Solomon Franco, a Sephardic Jew from Holland who is believed to have settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1649. Franco was a scholar and agent for Immanuel Perada, a Dutch merchant. He delivered supplies to Edward Gibbons, a major general in the Massachusetts militia. After a dispute over who should pay Franco (Gibbons or Perada), the Massachusetts General Court ruled on May 6, 1649, that Franco was to be expelled from the colony and granted him &quot;six shillings per week out of the Treasury for ten weeks, for sustenance, till he can get his passage to Holland.&quot;

===Solomon Pietersen===
Solomon Pietersen was a merchant from Amsterdam who came to New Amsterdam (in Lower Manhattan, today&#x27;s New York City) in 1654. In 1656, Pietersen became the first known American Jew to intermarry with a Christian; though there are no records showing Pietersen formally converted, his daughter Anna was baptized in childhood.

===Jacob Barsimson===
On July 8, 1654, Jacob Barsimson left Holland and arrived aboard &quot;Peartree&quot; on August 22 in the port of New Amsterdam (in Lower Manhattan, where Wall Street is today). Barsimson was employed by the Dutch East India Company and had fled the Portuguese settlements in the New World, which had captured a formerly Dutch settlement and established the Portuguese Inquisition there.

===Asser Levy===
Asser Levy (Van Swellem) is first mentioned in public records in New Amsterdam in 1654, in connection with the group of 23 Jews who arrived as refugees from Brazil. It is likely he preceded their arrival. Levy was the (kosher) butcher for the small Jewish community. He fought for Jewish rights in the Dutch colony and is famous for having secured the right of Jews to be admitted as Burghers and to serve guard duty for the colony.

===Samuel Cooper===
Cooper is first mentioned as a slave of his brother, William, in the 1750 Granville, North Carolina tax list. He was then listed as free in Roane County, North Carolina. Described alongside his brothers as being a &quot;Portuguese half-breed&quot;, as he and his brothers were of Portuguese Jewish, African, and Indigenous descent. 

At the end of the American Revolution, Samuel and his brothers were listed as &quot;traitors to the Revolution&quot;, as they had been part of a loyalist militia in the backcountry, and were subsequently expelled from Georgia. In 1787, the Cooper brothers all declared their loyalty to the Spanish crown in New Spain. They were then granted land, which they used to become tobacco planters with many slaves. Samuel received his land grant in 1795. 

His two brothers, William and Henry, were indebted to the Jewish slaveholding Monsanto family through several purchases of slaves. 

Samuel died 10 March, 1832, in Natchez, Mississippi.

==Dutch Brazilian Sephardi group==
The first &quot;group&quot; of Jews in the northern colonies disembarked in early September 1654, shortly after Barsimson. Barsimson is said to have met them at The Battery upon their arrival. This group was made up of 23 Portuguese Jews from the Netherlands (4 couples, 2 widows, and 13 children). Like Barsimson, they had fled from a former Dutch settlement; the group had emigrated from Dutch Brazil after the settlement was conquered by the Portuguese. Fearing the Inquisition, the Jews left Recife. They originally docked in Spanish Jamaica and Spanish Cuba, but the Spanish did not allow them to remain there. Their ship, &quot;Ste. Catherine&quot;, went to New Amsterdam instead, settling against the wishes of local merchants and the local Dutch Reformed Church. Colonial governor Peter Stuyvesant, upon complaint from these groups, attempted to have the Jews expelled. He wrote a letter to the directors of the Dutch West India Company dated September 22, 1654:

The Jews who have arrived would nearly all like to remain here, but learning that they (with their customary usury and deceitful trading with the Christians) were very repugnant to the inferior magistrates, as also to the people having the most affection for you; the Deaconry also fearing that owing to their present indigence they might become a charge in the coming winter, we have, for the benefit of this weak and newly developing place and the land in general, deemed it useful to require them in a friendly way to depart, praying also most seriously in this connection, for ourselves as also for the general community of your worships, that the deceitful race—such hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ—be not allowed to further infect and trouble this new colony to the detraction of your worships and the dissatisfaction of your worships&#x27; most affectionate subjects.

However, the directors of the Dutch West India Company included several influential Jews, who interceded on the refugees&#x27; behalf. Company officials rebuffed Stuyvesant and ordered him, in a letter dated April 26, 1655, to let the Jews remain in New Amsterdam, &quot;provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation&quot;:

We would have liked to effectuate and fulfill your wishes and request that the new territories should no more be allowed to be infected by people of the Jewish nation, for we foresee therefrom the same difficulties which you fear, but after having further weighed and considered the matter, we observe that this would be somewhat unreasonable and unfair, especially because of the considerable loss sustained by this nation, with others, in the taking of Brazil, as also because of the large amount of capital which they still have invested in the shares of this company. Therefore after many deliberations we have finally decided and resolved to apostille [annotate] upon a certain petition presented by said Portuguese Jews that these people may travel and trade to and in New Netherland and live and remain there, provided the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation. You will now govern yourself accordingly.

Upon the capture of the colony by the English in 1664, the rights enjoyed by the Jews were not interfered with, and for twenty years they appear to have lived much as before the establishment of English rule, though with slight increase in their numbers. Jews had previously been barred from settling in English colonies, as they had been banned from all English territory for 400 years. Oliver Cromwell (British Protector from 1649 through 1660, through his son Richard) lifted this prohibition, and the founding of the first major Jewish settlement soon followed in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1672, Rabba Couty attained prominence with his appeal to the King&#x27;s Council in England from a decree passed against him by the courts of Jamaica, as a result of which one of his ships was seized and declared forfeited. His appeal was successful and established the rights of Jews as British subjects. This appears to be the first case in which a colonial grant of naturalization was recognized as valid.

==New York==
In 1685, the application of Saul Brown (originally Saul Pardo) to trade at retail was denied, as was also that of the Jews for liberty to exercise their religion publicly. That they did so privately in a place of worship is evident from a map of New York, dated 1695, which shows the location of a synagogue on Beaver Street, also that Saul Brown was the minister, and that the congregation comprised 20 families. Five years later, the site of the synagogue was so well known that, in a conveyance of property, the premises were referred to as a &quot;landmark.&quot; In 1710, the minister of the congregation, Abraham de Lucena, was granted exemption from civil and military service by reason of his ministerial functions, and reference is made to the enjoyment of the same privileges by his predecessors. The minutes of the Congregation Shearith Israel of New York begin in 1729, when it was located on Mill Street, and refer to records dating back as far as 1706. This congregation was established on Mill Street, in 1730, on a lot purchased two years before, the first synagogue in the now United States.

It would thus appear that the religious rights of these early Jewish settlers had been secured in the beginning of the 18th century, and that they enjoyed many political rights. An act passed by the New York General Assembly on November 15, 1727, provided that when the oath of abjuration was to be taken by any British subject professing the Jewish religion, the words &quot;upon the true faith of a Christian&quot; might be omitted. Three days later, an act was passed naturalizing one Daniel Nunes da Costa. A bitter political controversy of 1737 resulted in the decision by the General Assembly that Jews should not be allowed to vote for members of that body.

In 1740, Parliament passed the Plantation Act, specifically permitting Jews to be naturalized in the colonies. Previously, however, the New York Colonial Assembly had passed numerous special acts of naturalization, some of which were applicable to individuals only; others, more general in character, said that Jews could be naturalized without taking oath &quot;upon the true faith of a Christian.&quot; Between this time and the Revolutionary War the Jewish community in this colony increased slowly, with immigrants coming mostly from Spain, Portugal, and the West Indies.

During the French and Indian War, Jacob Franks was the royal agent, in association with a British syndicate, for provisioning the British forces in America; his dealings with the crown during this period exceeded £750,000.

==Upstate New York settlement==
Although most of the earlier immigrants settled in New York City, a few settled beyond its limits, some even as far as the confines of what now constitutes the state of Pennsylvania. In 1661, when Albany was but a trading-post, Asser Levy owned real estate there, but between that date and the early years of the nineteenth century there are no records of any settlers in that town. They were not there in sufficient numbers to form a congregation until 1838, and they had no rabbi until 1846.

==In New England==

A group of Jews settled in Newport, Rhode Island in the late 1600s due to the official religious tolerance of the colony as established by Roger Williams. In other parts of New England there were probably occasional settlers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but the intolerance of the Puritans rendered impossible the establishment of any religious communities. According to several sources, Moses Simonson, who settled in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621, may have had Dutch Jewish ancestry. An interesting personality is that of Judah Monis, who became a convert to Christianity and filled the chair of Hebrew in Harvard College from 1722 until his death in 1764.

Mention is found of a Jew in Connecticut on November 9, 1659, and of another in 1670. The first Jewish family to settle in New Haven came in 1772, though a few individuals who had become converts to Christianity dwelt there a few years before. The first congregation was established about 1840, the congregants being members of about twenty Bavarian families. From that date on the community increased by slow stages. There are Jewish settlements also in Bridgeport, Ansonia, Derby, Waterbury, New London, and Hartford. The first congregation in Hartford was established in 1843. Since 1891, a number of Jewish farmers have been settled in various parts of the state.

The earliest mention of a Jew in Massachusetts bears the date May 3, 1649, and there are references to Jews among the inhabitants of Boston in 1695 and 1702; but they can be regarded only as stragglers, as no settlers made their homes in Massachusetts until the Revolutionary War drove the Jews from Newport. In 1777, Aaron Lopez and Jacob Rivera, with fifty-nine others, went from Newport to Leicester, and established themselves there; but this settlement did not survive the close of the war. A number of Jews, including the Hays family, settled at Boston before 1800. Of these Moses Michael Hays was the most important. In 1830, a number of Algerian Jews went to Boston, but they soon disappeared. The history of the present community begins with 1840, when the first congregation was established.

The Jewish immigrants to Vermont and New Hampshire have never been very numerous, though there are congregations in Burlington, Vermont and in Manchester, Nashua, Concord, Portsmouth, and Dover, New Hampshire. Little of importance can be said about the communal life of the Jews in New England, and their numbers increased but slowly until after the beginning of the great Russian emigration in 1882, when the overflow from New York as well as the emigration through Canada commenced to stream into New England.

The opening up of the West and the resulting unprofitable nature of farming in New England drew away from this part of the United States many thrifty farmers, who abandoned their unfruitful fields for the more attractive opportunities in the western states. Of interest in connection with this shifting of the population is the fact that many of these abandoned farms, especially in Connecticut, have been taken up by Russian Jews, who, principally as dairy farmers, have added a new and useful element to the agricultural community.

==Maryland==
It would seem that only a few Jews found their way to Maryland during the first half of the 17th century, and that the first settlers of this colony came as individuals, and not in considerable numbers at any time, as was the case in New York, Newport, Savannah, and Charleston. To judge by the names alone it would appear that a few Jews were resident in Maryland from the earliest days of the colony. The most prominent figure, who was unquestionably a Jew, was a Dr. Jacob Lumbrozo, who had arrived January 24, 1656, and who, in 1658, was tried for blasphemy, but was released by reason of the general amnesty granted in honor of the accession of Richard Cromwell (March 3, 1658). Letters of denization were issued to Lumbrozo September 10, 1663. Besides practising medicine, he also owned a plantation, engaged in trade with the Native Americans, and had active intercourse with London merchants. He was one of the earliest medical practitioners in the colony, and his career casts much light upon the history and nature of religious tolerance in Maryland. By the strength of his personality he was able to disregard nearly all the laws which would have rendered his residence in the colony impossible, and he seems to have observed his faith even though this, under the laws, was forbidden. The unfavorable environment rendered the admittance of Jews to Maryland difficult, and until the Constitution of 1776 established the religious rights of all, few Jews settled in the colony.

==Pennsylvania==

It is on record that Jews from New Amsterdam traded along the Delaware River as early as 1655. There were probably some settlers in the southeastern portion of the territory of which William Penn took possession in 1681. A very considerable number of the early Pennsylvania colonists were German Jews. The first Jewish resident of Philadelphia was Jonas Aaron, who was living there in 1703. Another early pioneer and one of considerable prominence was Isaac Miranda. He was the first to settle at Lancaster, at which place, as also at Shaefferstown, there was an early Jewish immigration. Miranda became a convert to Christianity and held several state offices. A number of Jews settled in Philadelphia in the first half of the eighteenth century, and became prominent in the life of the city. Among these were David Franks, Joseph Marks, and Sampson Levy. The Non-Importation Resolutions of 1765 contained the signatures of eight Jews, an indication of the importance of the Jewish community at this time. As early as 1747 a number of persons held religious services in a small house in Sterling alley, and afterward in Cherry alley—between Third and Fourth streets. They were mostly German and Polish Jews; and their differences as to the liturgy to be followed prevented, at the time, the formation of any regular congregation. Attempts, indeed, were made in 1761 and 1773 to form one, but none was established until the influx of Jews from New York during the Revolutionary War, with the arrival of Gershom Mendes Seixas, gave the community sufficient strength to carry out this cherished object. A lot was purchased and a synagogue erected, the dedication occurring in September 1782. A number of Philadelphia Jews served in the army of the Revolution; and the inestimable services rendered by Haym Salomon to Robert Morris in the finances of the Revolution make his name stand out as the most prominent character in American Jewry.

Jews have lived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, since at least 1730, before the town and county were organized. Joseph Simon was the best known of the first arrivals. Meyer Hart and Michael Hart were among the earlier settlers at Easton, where they arrived previous to the Revolutionary War. A synagogue was established there in 1839. Shaefferstown had a few Jewish settlers at an early date, and a synagogue and cemetery in 1732. For a considerable number of years preceding the Revolutionary War a number of Jews of Pennsylvania were engaged in the exploitation and sale of western Pennsylvania lands. Among the more prominent of these were Jacob and David Franks, Barnard and Michael Gratz, Joseph Simon, and Levy Andrew Levy.

==The American South==
The Jewish settlement in Georgia dates almost from the very foundation of the colony; and the early history of Georgia is practically the history of the growth and development of Savannah, Jewish life centering in that city. It would appear that a movement was set on foot in London to settle some Jews in the colony even before James Oglethorpe, in June, 1733, led his first band of followers to the point which soon after became the city of Savannah. The second vessel which reached the colony from England (on July 11, 1733) had among its passengers no less than forty Jewish emigrants. Although their arrival was unexpected, the liberal-minded governor welcomed them gladly, notwithstanding that he was aware that the trustees of the colony in England had expressed some opposition to permitting Jews to settle there. These first settlers were all of Spanish, Portuguese, and Prussian extraction, though within a year of their arrival others, who were apparently German Jews, also took up their residence there. These two bands of settlers received equally liberal treatment from Oglethorpe, and were the progenitors of one of the most important communities of Jews in the U.S. Many of their descendants are still living in various parts of the country. The first male white child born in the colony was a Jew, Philip (Uri) Minis on July 11, 1734.

Among the first immigrants was Dr. Nunis, who was made welcome because of his medical knowledge, and because he, with a number of others, brought sufficient wealth to the colony to enable the immigrants to take up large tracts of land. A congregation was organized as early as 1734. Three years later Abraham de Lyon, who had been a &quot;vigneron&quot; in Portugal, introduced the culture of grapes. The cultivation and manufacture of silk and the pursuit of agriculture and of commerce were the chief occupations of these early settlers. A dispute with the trustees of the colony respecting the introduction of slaves caused an extensive emigration to South Carolina in 1741, and resulted in the dissolution of the congregation. But in 1751 a number of Jews returned to Georgia, and in the same year the trustees sent over Joseph Ottolenghe to superintend the somewhat extensive silk-industry in the colony. Ottolenghi soon attained prominence in the political life of his associates, and was elected a member of the Assembly in 1761 and in succeeding years. There seems to have been little if any distinction made socially between the Jews and the other settlers, and educational and philanthropic institutions seem to have been supported by all alike.

The liberal charter which John Locke drew up in 1669 for the governance of the Carolinas should have operated to attract Jews there at an early date, since &quot;Jews, heathen, and dissenters&quot; were by the terms of Locke&#x27;s charter granted full liberty of conscience. Although political changes modified Locke&#x27;s original plans considerably, the spirit of tolerance was always retained. Nevertheless, no Jews in any numbers appear to have come to South Carolina until the exodus from Georgia from 1740 to 1771, already referred to. However, one Simon Valentine, one of four Jews who applied for citizenship in 1697, became the first documented Jewish landowner, which entitled him to vote. A few others followed him, for in 1703 a protest was raised against &quot;Jew strangers&quot; voting in an election for members of the Assembly.

In 1748, some prominent London Jews set on foot a scheme for the acquisition of a tract of (809 km2) of land in South Carolina. Nothing came of this, however, though on November 27, 1755, Joseph Salvador purchased (405 km2) of land near Fort Ninety-six for £2,000. Twenty years later Salvador sold (243 km2) of land for £3,000 to thirteen London Sephardic Jews. This land was known as the &quot;Jews&#x27; Lands.&quot; Another of the Salvadors (Francis Salvador, the nephew of Joseph) purchased extensive tracts of land in the same vicinity in 1773–74. Moses Lindo, likewise a London Jew, who arrived in 1756, became actively engaged in indigo manufacture, spending large sums in its development, and making this one of the principal industries of the state.

During the Revolutionary War the Jews of South Carolina were to be found on both sides; and the most eminent of the revolutionists was Francis Salvador, who was elected a member of the First and Second Provincial Congresses which met 1775–76, the most important political office held by any Jew during the Revolution. Two-thirds of a company of militia commanded by Richard Lushington was made up of Charleston Jews.

After the fall of Charleston in 1780 the majority of Jews left that city, but most of them returned at the close of the war. The Sephardic Jews established a congregation in 1750, and the Jews of German descent another shortly thereafter. In 1791, when the Sephardic congregation was incorporated, the total number of Jews in Charleston is estimated to have been 400.

To judge by names alone, it would appear that a few Jews wandered into Virginia as early as 1624. A small number seem also to have been there before the end of the seventeenth century, but for nearly 100 years no traces of Jewish settlement are found. At least one Jewish soldier—possibly two—served in Virginia regiments under Washington in his expedition across the Allegheny Mountains in 1754. It is probable that Jews drifted into the colony from Baltimore and other points in Maryland at an early date. By 1785, Richmond had a Jewish community of about a dozen families of Spanish-Portuguese descent, which organized a Sephardic congregation in 1791. This congregation remained in existence until 1898.

A few Jews were among the traders who settled in Tennessee, near the Holston River, in 1778, but they were mere stragglers and made no permanent settlement.

Of the remaining states of the southern group east of the Mississippi River the principal Jewish settlements have been made in Alabama and Mississippi. An occasional Jew made his way into the territory which is now Alabama during the early part of the eighteenth century. One Pallachio became prominent in 1776.

It is likely that there were a few Jews in the Natchez district of Mississippi before the close of the eighteenth century, but no congregation was organized until that of Natchez was established in 1843.

==In the American Revolution==

Before and during the American Revolutionary War the Jews had representatives of their people upon both sides of the controversy, though the majority joined the colonial side. On the Non-Importation Agreement of 1769 the names of not less than five Jews are found; this is also the case with respect to other agreements of a similar nature. The outbreak of the Revolutionary War dissolved the congregation in New York; and upon the eve of the British occupancy of the town the majority of the congregation, headed by Gershom Mendes Seixas, took all the belongings of the synagogue and removed to Philadelphia, where they established the first regular congregation, the Mickvé Israel, in 1782. The small number who remained in New York occasionally held services in the synagogue. Most of those who left for Philadelphia returned to New York after the war. Haym Solomon or (Salomon), (1740–1785) the prime financier of the American side during the American War of Independence. He was born in Prussia and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<text>The Damascus Affair of 1840 marks the real beginning of the diplomatic or international phase in the history of American Jews (though a reference to the services which Mordecai M. Noah rendered his country as consul at Tunis (1813–16) should not be omitted). The persecutions and tortures to which some of the most prominent Jews of Damascus had been subjected were reported to the Department of State at Washington, D.C. by the United States consul at Damascus. Immediate instructions, under date of 14 August 1840, were thereupon issued to John Gliddon, the United States consul at Alexandria, Egypt, by Secretary of State John Forsyth, in which he directed that all good offices and efforts be employed to display the active sympathy of the United States in the attempts that the governments of Europe were making to mitigate the horrors of these persecutions. Three days later David Porter, the United States minister to the Ottoman Empire, was instructed by Forsyth to do everything in his power at the Porte to alleviate the condition of the unfortunates. In both these communications the reasons for the intervention of the United States are based upon sentiments of justice and humanity, no American citizens being involved; in the communication to Minister Porter stress was laid upon the peculiar propriety and right of the intervention of the United States, because its political and civil institutions make no distinction in favor of individuals by reason of race or creed, but treat all with absolute equality.

==Damascus Affair==
Though it would appear that this action of the United States was taken without the solicitation of any Jews of the US, measures were already on foot to display the feeling of the Jews at this time. Public meetings were held in August and September 1840, in New York City, Philadelphia, and Richmond, participated in by both Christians and Jews, at which resolutions were passed asking the United States to intervene to procure justice for the accused and the mitigation of their hardships. Among the leaders who were instrumental in calling these meetings were Jacob Ezekiel of Richmond, J. B. Kurscheedt and Theodore J. Seixas of New York, and Isaac Leeser and John Moss of Philadelphia. Considerable correspondence passed between these leaders and the Department of State, in which the humanitarian attitude of the government and the nature of its intervention are fully disclosed.

Ten years later the Jews of the US were concerned in the diplomatic relations with Switzerland. Almost simultaneously the negotiations assumed two phases: (a) respecting the ratification of a treaty in which lurked the possibility that American citizens who were not Christians might be discriminated against, and (b) concerning the actual discrimination in Switzerland against American citizens, on the ground that they belonged to the Jewish faith.

==Swiss disabilities==
In November 1850, A. Dudley Mann, the American representative, negotiated a treaty with the Swiss Confederation, which was transmitted to the United States Senate on 13 February 1851, by President Millard Fillmore. At the same time the president sent a message in which he took exception to a part of the first article of the treaty, which specifically provided that Christians alone were to be entitled to the privileges guaranteed. An agitation against the ratification of the treaty was started by the Jews as soon as its existence was learned of, and Daniel Webster, then secretary of state, and Senator Henry Clay at once (February 1851) went on record as opposed to the objectionable clause of the treaty. The principal agents in stirring up the opposition were Isaac Leeser, David Einhorn, J. M. Cardozo of Charleston, South Carolina, and Capt. Jonas Phillips Levy of New York. A movement was set on foot in the US shortly thereafter (1852–53) to procure religious toleration abroad for American citizens generally; this was quite distinct from any movement started by the Jews, but greatly aided the latter. As a result of this combined opposition the Senate declined to ratify the treaty. Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan figured largely in the opposition to it. He corresponded with Rev. Isaac Leeser and Captain Levy respecting it, delivered several notable speeches in the Senate against it in 1854, and presented a petition on April 19, 1854, which had been signed by Jews of the United States at the instance of a committee of New York Jews, of which Alexander J. Kursheedt was chairman. As a result, the treaty was amended by the Senate, and in its amended form was ratified and proclaimed 9 November 1855. But the amendment, though less objectionable in phraseology, retained the same connotation and rendered it possible, under its terms, for the Swiss cantons to discriminate against Jews in the manner they had adopted in 1851. Though unsuccessful in preventing the ratification of the treaty, the agitation against it did not cease. Notwithstanding the treaty was proclaimed at the end of 1855, it would appear that this was not generally known until 1857. Attention was drawn to it by the fact that one A. H. Gootman, an American citizen and a Jew, had received notice in 1856 to leave La Chaux-de-Fonds, in Neuchâtel, where he had transacted business for five years. Public meetings of protest were held during 1857, in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Easton, Pa., Charleston, Baltimore, and elsewhere, and a vigorous opposition was voiced by Isaac M. Wise in his paper, &quot;The Israelite&quot;, by David Einhorn in &quot;Sinai&quot;, and by Isaac Leeser in &quot;The Occident&quot;. A convention of Jews met in Baltimore in October, and a delegation appointed by this convention waited on President James Buchanan in the same month to protest against the treaty and request its abrogation; the president promised to take steps to accede to their request so far as lay in his power. Numerous memorials were also transmitted to the president and the Senate. That this agitation attracted general attention is manifested by the fact that the newspapers throughout the country expressed vigorous opinions against the treaty.

Though sporadic efforts to procure an alteration in the treaty and the establishment of the rights not only of American Jews but of the Jews of all nations in Switzerland continued to be made in the United States, the principal scene of negotiations shifted to the former country, and the principal actor was Theodore Fay, the American minister. Beginning in August 1853, when an American citizen, the same Gootman referred to above, received orders from the authorities of La Chaux-de-Fonds, canton of Neuchâtel, to leave that canton on the ground that he was a Jew, Fay, though at first disinclined to take any very energetic stand, finally became much interested in the subject of Swiss discrimination against Jews and kept up an active agitation until his recall in 1860. He succeeded in procuring permission for Gootman to remain, but only as an act of grace, not by right. The obstacle Fay had to attempt to overcome lay in the nature of the Swiss Confederation, which left to the cantons the regulation of the rights of domicil, the Federal Council having no control over the cantons in this respect. Fay was ably supported in his contentions by the secretaries of state Marcy and Lewis Cass, especially the latter. In the course of his negotiations Fay made an elaborate study of the Jewish question as it affected Switzerland, and in June 1859, transmitted what he called his &quot;Israelite Note&quot; to the Federal Council. This is an extensive treatise explaining the American contention with much force, and embodying besides a general defense of the Jews. It was translated into German and French, was offered for sale by the Federal Council, received much notice in the Swiss newspapers, and caused the restrictions against Jews to be abolished in several cantons. In 1860 the executive committee of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites, of which Myer S. Isaacs was secretary, took steps to continue the agitation in America. Henry I. Hart, the president of the above-mentioned board, took up the matter with Secretary Seward shortly after he assumed office in 1861, and the secretary issued specific instructions to the new minister to Switzerland, George G. Fogg, to be no less active in his endeavor to establish the rights of American Jews than was his predecessor. The restrictions in the cantons were gradually abolished, and full civil rights were finally guaranteed to all Jews by the new Swiss Constitution of 1874. It may be added, however, that the treaty of 1855 is still in force (1905; &quot;Publ. Am. Jew. Hist. Soc.&quot; No. 11, pp. 7 et seq.).

==Serbia and Palestine==
In 1867 Myer S. Isaacs, on behalf of the Board of Delegates of American Israelites, endeavored unsuccessfully to have the government take some steps to alleviate the condition of the Jews in Serbia. In 1882 Gen. Lew Wallace, United States minister to the Ottoman Empire, moved by the hardships suffered by Russian refugees whom he found starving in the streets of Constantinople, called at the Foreign Office and received a communication from the minister of foreign affairs in which the statement was made that Jews would be made welcome anywhere in the Ottoman Empire, except in Ottoman Palestine. In 1884 he took vigorous action against the threatened expulsion from Jerusalem of sundry naturalized American Jews. In 1887 and 1888 attempts were made by the Ottoman government to limit the sojourn of American Jews in Jerusalem to one month—later extended to three months. This was earnestly opposed by the American minister, Oscar S. Straus, ably supported by Secretary Bayard, who contended that the United States, by reason of its Constitution, could not recognize any distinction between American citizens in respect to their religion. By his exertions Straus successfully halted any steps to expel American citizens who happened to be Jews (&quot;U.S. For. Rel.&quot; 1887, 1888, 1889). Secretaries Blaine, Gresham, and Hay repeatedly took a similar stand, and it would appear that rights of American citizens who are Jews have been carefully guarded in the Ottoman Empire (&quot;U.S. For. Rel.&quot; 1894, 1898, 1901).

==Morocco==
In 1863 atrocities perpetrated upon the Jews of Morocco led the Board of Delegates to ask the intervention of the United States. Secretary Seward instructed the United States consul at Tangier to use his good offices to further the mission of Sir Moses Montefiore, basing his act on the ground of common humanity. For two years the consul exerted himself to carry out his instructions and met with some slight success. In 1878 the Board of Delegates renewed its endeavors to have the government use its good offices in Morocco, and the consul at Tangier, F. A. Matthews, took earnest steps to alleviate the condition of the Jews whenever the opportunity arose during this and succeeding years. Adolph Sanger, on behalf of the Board of Delegates, in 1880 sent out an agent, L. A. Cohen, to Morocco to report on conditions there. In March 1881, the United States minister at Madrid, Lucius Fairchild, proceeded to Morocco to investigate the condition of the Jews. He made a sympathetic and valuable report to the secretary of state, Blaine, in which he displayed an acute interest in the unfortunate conditions in that country, and did his utmost to alleviate them.

==Romanian disabilities==
Romanian conditions, which have so vitally interested the United States, first had attention drawn to them by the Board of Delegates in June 1867, when the good offices of the United States in behalf of the persecuted Jews of Romania were requested. In 1870 B. F. Peixotto of New York was appointed consul-general to Romania, and during the six years that he held office he exerted himself to bring about an improvement in the condition of the Jews. In 1878 John A. Kasson, minister of the United States to Austria, in a despatch to the Department of State proposed as a condition preliminary to the recognition of Romanian independence that the United States join with the European powers in exacting from Romania, at the Congress of Berlin, the recognition of the equal civil, commercial, and religious rights of all classes of her population, as also equal rights and protection under the treaty and under Romanian laws, irrespective of race or religious belief. In opening negotiations with Romania in the following year, the recognition by that country of the rights of sojourn and trade of all classes of Americans irrespective of race or creed was strongly emphasized, as it was by Kasson about the same time with respect to Serbia. The continued persecutions of the Jews of Romania, her violations of the provisions of the Treaty of Berlin, and the greatly increased proportions which the Romanian emigration to the United States assumed in consequence, as also the failure to conclude a naturalization convention between the two countries, because Romania would not recognize the rights of American citizens who were Jews, moved Secretary of State John Hay to address on 11 August 1902, identical instructions to the representatives of the United States in Russia, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Turkey upon the subject of Romania&#x27;s attitude. In this note he drew attention to the consequences to the United States of the continued persecutions in Romania—namely, the unnatural increase of immigration from that country—and upon this based his right to remonstrate to the signatories to the Treaty of Berlin against the acts of the Romanian government. Further, he sustained the right of the United States to ask the above-mentioned powers to intervene upon the strongest grounds of humanity. Acting upon the forcible instructions, the representatives of the United States presented this note to the government to which each was accredited. But beyond the abolition of the Oath More Judaico (1904) and some slight diminution of the harshness of the persecution, little has been accomplished, and Romania continues (1905) almost unrestrictedly to violate the treaty which established her as an independent nation. In 1905 Congress made provision for an American legation at Bucharest.

==Russian passports==
The diplomatic correspondence between Russia and the United States involving Jews is of considerable bulk. It relates for the most part to the failure of Russia to recognize the validity of American passports where Jews are involved, which is the principal cause of difference between the United States and Russia. Russia has constantly violated the provisions of her treaty of 1832 with the United States, which gives to the citizens of the two countries unrestricted rights of sojourn, travel, and protection. Until the persecutions in Russia assumed acute form, beginning with 1880, the correspondence between the two countries was not of importance, though occasional earlier instances of discrimination by Russia against American citizens who were Jews had been vigorously protested against by the United States authorities. For the past twenty-five years the record is one of unceasing effort on the part of the United States to establish the rights of American citizens who are Jews, and of continued declination of Russia to live up to her treaty stipulations. The threatened expulsion from St. Petersburg of an American citizen named Pinkos, in 1880, was the occasion for the presentation of energetic notes of remonstrance by John W. Foster, the American minister to Russia. He acted not alone of his own responsibility, but was the recipient of specific instructions from the secretary of state, William M. Evarts. In the course of one of Evarts&#x27; letters of instruction the attitude assumed by the United States was clearly set forth in the following terms: &quot;In the view of this government the religion professed by one of its citizens has no relation to that citizen&#x27;s right to the protection of the United States&quot; (&quot;Am. Jewish Year Book,&quot; 1904-5, p. 287). The first protests of Foster and Evarts, inasmuch as they brought forth no satisfactory replies, were succeeded by others of the same tenor, in one of which Evarts stated &quot;that we ask treaty treatment for our aggrieved citizens, not because they are Jews, but because they are Americans&quot; (ib. p. 290). All the answers of the Russian Foreign Office are based on the claim that the proscriptive laws against the Jews were in existence prior to the treaty of 1832, that they, therefore, must be assumed under the treaty, and, furthermore, that the Jewish question in Russia was complicated by economic and other difficulties. These views were answered in the able despatch of James Blaine, secretary of state, of July 29, 1881. This despatch covers in considerable detail the whole of the American contention, and is so forcibly put that subsequent consideration of the same subject by the Department of State has been unable to add much to it (&quot;For. Rel. U.S.&quot; 1881, p. 1030). As continued remonstrances during subsequent years led to no results, in 1893 the Department of State took the stand that it could not acquiesce in the action of Russian consuls in asking the religion of American citizens desiring to travel in Russia before granting a visé to their passports, and refusing Jews. The government regarded this as the &quot;assumption of a religious inquisitorial function within our own borders, by a foreign agency, in a manner... repugnant to the national sense.&quot; In 1895 this view was forcibly presented to the Russian government by the American minister, Clifton R. Breckenridge, and in July of that year the Department of State took the attitude that a &quot;continuance in such a course, after our views have been clearly but considerately made known, may trench upon the just limits of consideration&quot; (ib. pp. 295, 297). But in spite of the presentation of the American contention in every possible light and with all possible emphasis, Russia stubbornly refuses to live up to her treaty obligations.

In April 1902, at the instance of Henry M. Goldfogle, a member of Congress from New York, the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling upon the secretary of state to inform the House &quot;whether American citizens of the Jewish religious faith holding passports issued by this government are barred or excluded from entering the territory of the Empire of Russia,&quot; and what action concerning the matter had been taken by the government. A few days later Secretary Hay replied, stating in brief what efforts had been made by the United States for the protection of American citizens in Russia, and added that though &quot;begun many years ago... [they] have not been attended with encouraging success&quot; (ib. pp. 301, 302).

In January 1904, Goldfogle introduced another resolution, requesting the president to resume negotiations with Russia looking to the recognition of the validity of American passports irrespective of the religion of the holder. This resolution gave rise to notable addresses on the part of a number of members of the House, and was passed, in substance, in April of that year (ib. pp. 304, 305). In consequence of this resolution the question of American passports was taken up anew by the Department of State during the summer of 1904. The Russian reply made at that time was to the effect that a commission had been created in 1903 to consider the revision of the passport regulations, and that the desires of the United States would be brought to the attention of that commission. In his annual message, December 1904, President Roosevelt wrote vigorously against the Russian attitude, characterizing it as &quot;unjust and irritating toward us.&quot; In February 1905, a committee of members of the House of Representatives was formed, with Wachter of Maryland as chairman, to urge further action by the Department of State. As yet nothing significant has been accomplished.

===Kishinef petition===

The massacres at Kishinef in April 1903, aroused indignation throughout the United States. Though in response to a cable of inquiry sent by Secretary John Hay to Ambassador Robert S. McCormick at St. Petersburg, asking if relief could be sent to the sufferers, the ambassador stated that he was informed officially that there was no distress or want in south-western Russia, nevertheless mass-meetings were held in almost every city of importance, and the comments in the newspapers portrayed the feelings of horror of the American people. A practical turn was given by the collection of considerable sums to alleviate the misery of the unfortunates. In the hope that if the attention of the czar were directly brought to the plight of the Jews in his dominions their condition might be alleviated, the Independent Order of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith took measures to prepare a petition for transmittal to him. On June 15, 1903, a committee of the order waited upon Secretary Hay and President Theodore Roosevelt, and presented a tentative draft of the petition. This having met with their approval, it was then circulated throughout the United States, and over 12,500 signatures of Christians and Jews in all walks of life were appended to it. On July 15 the American representative at St. Petersburg was instructed to ask an audience of the minister of foreign affairs in order to find out whether the petition, which was given in full in the despatch, would be received by the minister to be put before the czar. The minister declined to receive it, and the bound copy with the signatures was placed by Secretary Hay in the archives of the Department of State in October 1903. Though the petition did not reach its destination, its words attained worldwide publicity, and its object was in a measure accomplished in this way (Adler, &quot;Voice of America on Kishineff,&quot; 1904).

Throughout the history of the United States the government has insisted with great force upon the equal treatment of all American citizens in foreign countries, irrespective of race or creed. Further, it never has failed to intercede with foreign governments on humanitarian grounds, whenever the opportunity arose, in behalf of Jews who were being persecuted or of those to whom life was rendered precarious by inhuman proscriptive laws. A considerable number of Jews have held diplomatic posts, among the more prominent being Mordecai M. Noah, consul to Tunis, 1813–16; Edwin de Leon, consul-general to Egypt, 1854; August Belmont, secretary of legation at The Hague, 1853–55, and minister resident, 1855–58; Oscar S. Straus, minister to Turkey, 1887–89, 1897–1900; Solomon Hirsch, minister to Turkey, 1889–92; B. F. Peixotto, consul to Bucharest, 1870–76; Simon Wolf, consul-general to Egypt, 1881; Max Judd, consul-general to Vienna, 1893–97; and Lewis Einstein, third secretary of embassy at Paris, 1903, and London, 1905.

<doc id="1146692" wikidata="Q1542338" url="?curid=1146692" title="The Marvelettes">
<text>The Marvelettes were an American girl group formed in Inkster, Michigan in 1960, consisting of schoolmates Gladys Horton, Katherine Anderson, Georgeanna Tillman, Juanita Cowart (now Cowart Motley), and Georgia Dobbins, who was replaced by Wanda Young prior to the group signing their first record deal. Achieving popularity in the early to mid-1960s, they were the first successful act of Motown Records after the Miracles and its first significantly successful female group after the release of the 1961 number-one single, &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, one of the first number-one singles recorded by an all-female vocal group and the first by a Motown recording act.

The group struggled with problems of poor promotion from Motown, health issues and substance abuse, with Cowart the first to leave in 1963, followed by Tillman in 1965, and Horton in 1967. Nevertheless, they managed a comeback in 1966 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Bill&quot;. In 1969, the group ceased performing and disbanded the next year, following the release of &quot;The Return of the Marvelettes&quot; featuring only Young (under her married name, Wanda Rogers). That year, both Rogers and Katherine Anderson retired from the music business.

==History==
===Origins and initial success===
The group that would become the Marvelettes formed at Inkster High School in Inkster, Michigan, a suburb located west of Detroit, Michigan by fifteen-year-old glee club member Gladys Horton in the fall of 1960. Horton enlisted older glee club members Katherine Anderson, Georgeanna Tillman, Juanita Cowart, and a high school graduate Georgia Dobbins (May 5, 1942 – September 18, 2020) to join her. The members struggled to come up with a name for their new act until one of the members jokingly took a stab at their own singing abilities, saying &quot;we can&#x27;t sing yet.&quot; Horton altered the saying to &quot;the Casinyets&quot;.

In 1961, the quintet, now called the Marvels, entered a talent show contest on the behest of their teacher and ended up finishing in fourth place. Though only the first three winners were offered a trip to audition for the fledgling Motown label, two of the girls&#x27; schoolteachers advised that they be allowed to audition too. Upon auditioning for Motown executives including Brian Holland and Robert Bateman, they had a second audition with bigger staff including Smokey Robinson and the label president and founder, Berry Gordy, who while impressed with their vocal styles advised them to come back with their own composition. Returning to Inkster, Georgia Dobbins contacted a local musician named William Garrett, who had an unfinished blues composition titled &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;; Garrett allowed Dobbins to use it as long as he received songwriting credit if the song became a hit. Despite having no previous songwriting experience, Dobbins took the song home and reshaped it overnight to reflect the teenage sound of doo-wop.

Prior to returning to Motown, Dobbins left the group due to her growing family and her father, who advised her not to continue her career in show business. Dobbins&#x27; departure left Horton in full charge of the group. To replace her, Horton asked another Inkster graduate, Wanda Young, to replace Dobbins. When the group returned and performed their composition, Gordy agreed to work with the group but under the advice that they change their name. Gordy renamed them the Marvelettes and signed the act to Motown&#x27;s Tamla division in July 1961. The following month, the group recorded &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, which was polished by Brian Holland, Robert Bateman and Freddie Gorman, another songwriting partner of Holland (before Holland became part of the Holland–Dozier–Holland team), who moonlighted as a mailman, as well as the song &quot;So Long Baby&quot;, sung by Wanda. Tamla issued &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; on August 21, 1961. The song then climbed to the top of the singles chart, reaching number one that December. making them the first Motown act to have a chart-topper on the Hot 100.

To follow up on this success, Motown had the group record &quot;Twistin&#x27; Postman&quot; to take advantage of the twist dance craze and the re-release of Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;The Twist&quot;. The song eventually peaked at number 34 on the pop chart in early 1962. Before the end of 1961, Tamla issued the first Marvelettes album, also named &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, but it failed to chart. The group&#x27;s next single, &quot;Playboy&quot;, marked the second time one of their singles was written by a band member, this time by Gladys Horton. Like &quot;Postman&quot;, the song was retooled by other writers and upon its release in early 1962, reached number 7. A fourth hit, &quot;Beechwood 4-5789&quot;, co-written by Marvin Gaye, reached number 17. During 1962, two more albums would be issued by the band including &quot;Smash Hits of &#x27;62&quot; (later issued as &quot;The Marvelettes Sing&quot;) and &quot;Playboy&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Beechwood&quot;, R&amp;B radio stations also frequently played the single&#x27;s flip side, &quot;Someday, Someway&quot;, which paid off sending the song to number 8 on the R&amp;B chart; their first double-sided hit.

Due to their success, the group had to leave school in order to perform and despite the promise of tutors to help with their schooling, they were never granted any. Due to their young ages and Horton being an orphaned ward of the courts, they eventually were taken in by Esther Gordy Edwards, who bused them to Motortown Revue shows. After several successful top 40 recordings, the group released the modest success, &quot;Strange I Know&quot;, which peaked at number 49. In early 1963, the group was shortened to a quartet when Juanita Cowart opted to leave, citing a mental breakdown caused by stress from performing on the road, and her embarrassment at getting flustered during an interview appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; (wherein she identified Detroit as a suburb of Inskter, rather than the other way around). Carrying on as a quartet, the group issued one of Holland–Dozier–Holland&#x27;s early compositions, &quot;Locking Up My Heart&quot;, which peaked at number 44. It was one of the first singles to feature Horton and Young in co-leads. The success of &quot;Locking&quot; was probably tested due to strong airplay by the song&#x27;s B-side, the Young-led ballad &quot;Forever&quot;, which also received a pop charting, peaking at number 78. Then Berry Gordy composed and produced the single, &quot;My Daddy Knows Best&quot;, but it was their lowest charting at the time, number 67.

===Departure of Georgeanna Tillman and renewed success===
By 1964, the majority of American vocal groups—especially all female bands such as the Shirelles and the Ronettes—started struggling with finding a hit, after the arrival of British pop and rock acts. In the meantime, other Motown girl groups such as Martha and the Vandellas and the Supremes were starting to get promoted by Motown staff, with the Vandellas becoming the top girl group of 1963. The following year, the Supremes took their place as the label&#x27;s top female vocalist group after a succession of hit recordings that year, culminating in the release of their second album, &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, which Motown was able to promote successfully. Some sources claim &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; was turned down by the Marvelettes. Gladys recalls &quot;When they played &#x27;Where Did Our Love Go&#x27; they played &#x27;Too Many Fish in the Sea&#x27;. We picked &#x27;Too Many Fish in the Sea&#x27; because it had all the music and all the bongos. We were all together and said at the same time we didn&#x27;t want &#x27;Where Did Our Love Go&#x27;.&quot;

That year, the Marvelettes hit the top forty with the Norman Whitfield production, &quot;Too Many Fish in the Sea&quot;, reaching number 25 on the Hot 100 with the recording. By now Motown had begun its charm school, hiring choreographer Cholly Atkins and etiquette expert Maxine Powell to refine the label&#x27;s acts. Atkins began polishing the Marvelettes&#x27; dance moves, while Powell taught the group to be more graceful, telling them and every other Motown act that they would &quot;perform in front of kings and queens&quot;. Meanwhile, two of the Marvelettes got married: Georgeanna Tillman to longtime boyfriend Billy Gordon of the Contours, and Wanda Young to longtime boyfriend Bobby Rogers of the Miracles, changing her name to Wanda Rogers. By the end of 1964, Georgeanna Tillman, a longtime sufferer of sickle cell anemia, was diagnosed with lupus. By early 1965, struggling to keep up with their stringent recording sessions and touring schedules and her illnesses, a doctor of Tillman&#x27;s advised her to leave performing for good. The remaining Marvelettes carried on as a trio from then on.

In mid-1965, Wanda Rogers took over as lead vocalist, as Motown producers felt Rogers&#x27; voice was more suitable for this role than Horton&#x27;s. With Rogers as lead, the group had a hit with &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep Holding On&quot;, which reached number 34 while &quot;Danger! Heartbreak Dead Ahead&quot; settled for a number 61 showing but was number 11 on the R&amp;B chart. Later in 1965, the group released the Smokey Robinson composition, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Bill&quot;, which brought the group back to the top ten, reaching number 7 and becoming their second single to sell over a million copies. From then on, with Robinson mainly in charge, most of the Marvelettes singles would feature Rogers on lead. In 1966, they had a modest success with &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot; and by the end of that year, they reached the top 20 with &quot;The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game&quot;, also composed by Robinson. In 1967, the group recorded the Van McCoy composition, &quot;When You&#x27;re Young and in Love&quot;, which had been originally recorded by Ruby &amp; the Romantics. The song reached number 23 in the U.S. and peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their only British hit.

===Decline===
By 1967, Gladys Horton had reconsidered her involvement with the Marvelettes. After her first child, Sammie, was born with cerebral palsy, Horton decided to leave the group entirely, doing so before the release of the hit &quot;My Baby Must Be a Magician&quot;. The song peaked at number 17 and was noted for featuring the Temptations&#x27; Melvin Franklin providing the opening line. With Horton out, Harvey Fuqua introduced the group to Ann Bogan who became Horton&#x27;s replacement. However, by the time Bogan joined the group in 1968, most of the musicians of Motown&#x27;s early years had left, mainly due to financial disputes with the label. The group struggled with recordings after the release of &quot;Magician&quot;, with Motown offering little to no promotion. The 1968 singles &quot;Here I Am Baby&quot; and &quot;Destination: Anywhere&quot; were only modestly successful, peaking at number 44 and number 63 respectively. The release of their 1969 album, &quot;In Full Bloom&quot;, failed as did its only single, the remake of Justine Washington&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s How Heartaches Are Made&quot;.

Wanda Rogers, who had suffered from a number of personal problems for some time, became unreliable and difficult to work with. Concert scheduling was difficult as she sometimes failed to turn up for performances. In 1970, Rogers recorded songs for a solo album, produced by Smokey Robinson and including covers of earlier Motown recordings, which Motown decided to market as &quot;The Return of The Marvelettes&quot;. As this album featured no other Marvelettes, original member Katherine Anderson refused to participate in appearing on the cover of the album due to what she felt was Motown&#x27;s disrespect towards her and the group. The album was only a modest hit, reaching number 50 on the R&amp;B albums chart and featured no charted hit singles. Following this, the group disbanded with Katherine Anderson settling briefly as a staff writer for Motown. After Motown moved to Los Angeles in 1972, Anderson and Rogers left the business altogether, returning to Michigan with Anderson settling in her hometown of Inkster while Rogers moved to Southfield, Michigan. Meanwhile, Gladys Horton had moved to Los Angeles where she raised her three sons.

===Later years===
In January 1980, former Marvelette and original member Georgeanna Tillman died from complications of lupus, in her mother&#x27;s house in Inkster, at the age of 36. Shortly afterwards, several of the former members filed suit against Motown, complaining of not receiving any royalties from their work. In 1989, Gladys Horton tried to reunite the original Marvelettes after being offered a contract with Motorcity Records. Wanda Young was the only other Marvelette to agree to sing on the recording. Following this, Horton continued to perform, sometimes as &quot;Gladys Horton of the Marvelettes&quot;. Due to a legal disagreement with Larry Marshak, who bought the Marvelettes&#x27; name from Motown after the label lost rights to the name, Horton would fight for years to retain ownership of the name. Marshak had several groups billing themselves as &quot;the Marvelettes&quot;, but the women who portrayed themselves as the Marvelettes were much younger than the original line-up, and had not recorded on any of the Marvelettes&#x27; original Motown hits.

By 2006, thanks to the efforts of former Supremes singer Mary Wilson, legislation had been launched in 33 states via the Truth In Music Act to prevent performers from using the name of a group that didn&#x27;t have at least one original member, causing the groups who Marshak had hired as Marvelettes to bill themselves as &quot;Tribute to the Marvelettes&quot;. Both Horton and Katherine Anderson began fighting to get back ownership of the name and were in their final stages of having the name returned to them when Horton died from a stroke at a California nursing home in January 2011. Following their exits from the Marvelettes, both Georgia Dobbins and Juanita Cowart remained in Inkster and settled into life outside the entertainment industry, with Cowart being active in her Inkster church choir. Katherine Anderson lived in Inkster, mentoring several Detroit-area vocal groups. Ann Bogan, the latter-day member of the group, now lives in Cleveland, Ohio and became a part of the New Birth and their subgroup, Love, Peace &amp; Happiness, before retiring to raise her children. All the surviving members of the group at that time, including Dobbins and Rogers, were interviewed for an episode of their lives on the TV-One show, &quot;Unsung&quot;.

Georgia Dobbins died of cardiac arrest in Inkster on September 18, 2020, at age 78. Wanda Rogers was living in Westland, Michigan, with her daughter until her death from COPD on December 15, 2021, at age 78. Katherine Anderson died of heart failure on September 20, 2023, at age 79.As of 2024, Juanita Cowart Motley is the only surviving original member of the group.

==Legacy==

In 2005, the group was awarded two Gold plaques for their biggest hits, &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Bill&quot; after the RIAA had certified the singles as million-sellers. The following year, Horton appeared on the PBS concert special, &quot;My Music: Salute to Early Motown&quot;, along with other Motown stars from the label&#x27;s early years. Some of the group&#x27;s recordings were later sampled for songs by rap musicians, most notably Jay-Z&#x27;s song, &quot;Poppin&#x27; Tags&quot;, sampled the group&#x27;s 1970 cover of Smokey Robinson&#x27;s composition, &quot;After All&quot;, from his 2002 album, &quot;The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; The Curse&quot;.

In 1995, they were honored with the &quot;Pioneer Award&quot; at the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation. In 2004, the group was inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2006, Marc Taylor issued the biography, &quot;The Original Marvelettes: Motown&#x27;s Mystery Girl Group&quot;. The group&#x27;s story had been documented several years before in &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine from a 1984 article.

In 2007, the Marvelettes were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

In 2009, as part of Motown&#x27;s 50th Anniversary celebrations, a new limited-edition triple-CD set on the group entitled &quot;The Marvelettes: Forever – The Complete Motown Albums Vol. 1&quot; was released. This featured the group&#x27;s first six albums, some of which had never been released on CD. &quot;The Marvelettes: Forever More – The Complete Motown Albums Vol. 2&quot;, which included their later albums and bonus material, was released in 2011. Their often covered million selling #1 hit &quot;Please Mr Postman&quot; was inducted into the &quot;Grammy Hall of Fame&quot; in 2011.

The Marvelettes were nominated for 2013 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They became eligible for induction in 1987. Although they did not garner enough votes for induction, they made the ballot a second time for induction in the year 2015.

On August 17, 2013 the Marvelettes were inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in Cleveland and again in June 2017 in Detroit, Michigan.

<text>Lambaesis (Lambæsis), Lambaisis or Lambaesa (&quot;Lambèse&quot; in colonial French), is a Roman archaeological site in Algeria, southeast of Batna and west of Timgad, located next to the modern village of Tazoult. The former bishopric is also a Latin Catholic titular bishopric.

== History ==
Lambaesa was founded by the Roman military. The camp of the third legion (Legio III &quot;Augusta&quot;), to which it owes its origin, appears to have been established between AD 123–129, in the time of Roman emperor Hadrian, whose address to his soldiers was found inscribed on a pillar in a second camp to the west of the great camp still extant. However, other evidence suggests it was formed during the Punic Wars.

By AD 166 mention is made of the decurions of a &quot;vicus&quot;, 10 &quot;curiae&quot; of which are known by name; and the &quot;vicus&quot; became a &quot;municipium&quot; probably at the time when it was made the capital of the newly founded province of Numidia. Lambaesis was populated mainly by Romanized Berbers and by some Roman colonists with their descendants: Latin was the official and commonly used language (even if local Berbers spoke their own language mixed with Latinisms).

III Augusta was disbanded by Gordian III and the legionaries dispersed among the North African provinces. But the legion was restored in the AD 250s by Valerianus and Gallienus and from then on the legion was known as Augusta Restituta. Its final departure did not take place till after AD 392 (the town soon afterwards declined). 
Indeed, under Septimius Severus (AD 193 ), Numidia was separated from Africa Vetus, and governed by an imperial procurator. Under the new organization of the empire by Diocletian, Numidia was divided in two provinces: the north became &quot;Numidia Cirtensis&quot;, with capital at Cirta, while the south, which included the Aurès Mountains and was threatened by raids, became &quot;Numidia Militiana&quot;, &quot;Military Numidia&quot;, with capital at the legionary base of Lambaesis.

Subsequently, however, Emperor Constantine the Great reunited the two provinces in a single one, administered from Cirta, which was now renamed &quot;Constantina&quot; (modern Constantine, Algeria) in his honour. Its governor was raised to the rank of &quot;consularis&quot; in AD 320, and the province remained one of the seven provinces of the diocese of Africa until the invasion of the Vandals in AD 428, which began its slow decay, accompanied by desertification. The province remained under Vandal rule, but was effectively limited to the coastal areas by Berber raids. It was restored to Roman rule after the Vandalic War, when it became part of the new praetorian prefecture of Africa.

The Byzantines occupied Lambaesis and vicinity from the sixth century but around AD 683 the Arabs conquered the area, naming what remained of the city Bar-el-Molouk in the 10th century.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Lambaesis was an episcopal see during late Ancient times as part of the Roman province of Numidia. For such an important town, its bishopric is surprisingly absent from the historical record. Lambaesis did not send a representative to the Council of Nicaea nor Chalcedon and is not mentioned by LeQuinn .
Saint Cyprian mentions a heretic bishop of Lambaesis who was condemned by a local synod of bishops around the year 240.

=== Titular see ===
The extinct diocese was nominally restored as a titular bishopric. Initially revived as Lambaisis, it was renamed Lambaesis in 1925.

* Marc Pelchat (2016.10.25 – ...), Auxiliary Bishop of Québec (Canada)

== Remains ==
The remains of the Roman town, and more especially of the Roman camp, in spite of wanton vandalism, are among the most interesting ruins in northern Africa.

The ruins are situated on the lower terraces of the Aures Mountains, and consist of triumphal arches (one to Septimius Severus, another to Commodus), temples, aqueducts, vestiges of an amphitheatre, baths and an immense quantity of masonry belonging to private houses. To the north and east lie extensive cemeteries with the stones standing in their original alignments; to the west is a similar area, from which, however, the stones have been largely removed for building the modern village.

Of the temple of Aesculapius only one column is standing, though in the middle of the 19th century its façade was entire. The capitol or temple dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, which has been cleared of debris, has a portico with eight columns. On level ground about two-thirds of a mile from the centre of the ancient town stands the camp, its site now partly occupied by the penitentiary and its gardens. It measures by , and in the middle rise the ruins of a building commonly called, but incorrectly, the praetorium. This noble building, which dates from 268, is long by broad and high; its southern façade has a splendid peristyle half the height of the wall, consisting of a front row of massive Ionic columns and an engaged row of Corinthian pilasters.
Behind this building (which was roofed), is a large court giving access to other buildings, one being the arsenal. In it have been found many thousands of projectiles. To the southeast are the remains of the baths. The ruins of both city and camp have yielded many inscriptions (Renier edited 1500, and there are 4185 in CIL viii); and, though a very large proportion are epitaphs of the barest kind, the more important pieces supply an outline of the history of the place.

Over 2500 inscriptions relating to the camp have been deciphered. In a museum in the village are objects of antiquity discovered in the vicinity. In addition to inscriptions and statues, there are some fine mosaics found in 1905 near the arch of Septimius Severus. The statues include those of Aesculapius and Hygieia, taken from the temple of Aesculapius.

About south of Lambessa are the ruins of Markuna, the ancient Verecunda, including two triumphal arches.

<doc id="1146707" wikidata="Q7996769" url="?curid=1146707" title="Whitney immersion theorem">
<text>In differential topology, the Whitney immersion theorem (named after Hassler Whitney) states that for formula_1, any smooth formula_2-dimensional manifold (required also to be Hausdorff and second-countable) has a one-to-one immersion in Euclidean formula_3-space, and a (not necessarily one-to-one) immersion in formula_4-space. Similarly, every smooth formula_2-dimensional manifold can be immersed in the formula_6-dimensional sphere (this removes the formula_1 constraint).

The weak version, for formula_8, is due to transversality (general position, dimension counting): two &quot;m&quot;-dimensional manifolds in formula_9 intersect generically in a 0-dimensional space.

==Further results==
William S. Massey went on to prove that every &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold is cobordant to a manifold that immerses in formula_10 where formula_11 is the number of 1&#x27;s that appear in the binary expansion of formula_12. In the same paper, Massey proved that for every &quot;n&quot; there is manifold (which happens to be a product of real projective spaces) that does not immerse in formula_13. 

The conjecture that every &quot;n&quot;-manifold immerses in formula_10 became known as the immersion conjecture. This conjecture was eventually solved in the affirmative by .

<text>Titan Publishing Group is the publishing division of the British entertainment company Titan Entertainment, which was established as Titan Books in 1981. The books division has two main areas of publishing: film and television tie-ins and cinema reference books; and graphic novels and comics references and art titles. Its imprints are Titan Books, Titan Comics, Titan Magazines and Titan Manga.

==Titan Books==
Titan Books is a publisher of film, video game and TV tie-in books. As of 2011, the company publishes on average 30 to 40 such titles per year, across a range of formats from &quot;making of&quot; books to screenplays to TV companions and novels, and has a backlist reprint program.

Titan Books&#x27; first title was a trade paperback collection of Brian Bolland&#x27;s Judge Dredd stories from &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Titan Books followed the first title with numerous other &quot;2000 AD&quot; reprints. Subsequently, the publishing company expanded operations, putting out its first original title in 1987 (Pat Mills and Hunt Emerson&#x27;s &quot;You Are Maggie Thatcher&quot;). Around this time, Titan also began publishing &quot;Escape&quot; magazine (although the title was canceled in 1989). Titan Books continues to publish both new and licensed graphic novels, as well as film and television tie-ins.

Titan Books’ range of fiction includes limited comic books tie-ins and novelizations for such films as &quot;Alien (film)&quot;, &quot;Predator (film)&quot; and &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;, &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;.

Titan also publishes coffee table books on animation, popular culture, collectibles and comic and fantasy art including &quot;&quot; published in 2019, &quot;Flash Gordon: The Official Story of the Film&quot; published in 2020 and &quot;Escape from New York: The Official Story of the Film&quot; published in 2021, all written by John Walsh. As of 2016, Titan Books&#x27; editorial director is Laura Price.

Its titles include such licensed characters and properties as &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Nemi&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and other &quot;2000 AD&quot; characters, the Vertigo comic-book title &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Tank Girl&quot;, &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, &quot;Life Is Strange&quot;, &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, &quot;Dan Dare&quot;, &quot;WWE Heroes&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;Bloodborne&quot;.

In 2010, Titan acquired the American hardboiled fiction imprint Hard Case Crime, and since that time has released a number of comics and graphic novels under the Hard Case Crime brand. Heroic Signatures gave Titan the license to publish new titles featuring Conan the Barbarian in 2022. As of 2021, Titan Comics&#x27; publishing directors are Ricky Claydon and John Dziewiatkowski.

== Titan Magazines ==
Titan Magazines is the magazine-publishing division of Titan Publishing Group. Launched in 1995 with &quot;Star Trek Magazine&quot;, Titan had previously published several one shot film tie-in titles. Since then it has published many film, TV and comics titles, including poster magazines for Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;.

Some of Titan&#x27;s magazines are published in the US, although not all, some with an entirely separate magazine.

In April 2016, Bleeding Cool published a blog/vlog entry pertaining to concerns over Titan&#x27;s UK reprints of DC titles, specifically cancellations and a lack of updates and communication with readers, as well as addressing the frequent inconsistencies regarding the publication dates of future issues. 

Titan ceased publication of all their DC Comics titles in December 2018, most notably ending a fifteen-year run for &#x27;Batman Legends&#x27;.

<doc id="1146726" wikidata="Q7937295" url="?curid=1146726" title="Vittoria Dock">
<text>Vittoria Dock is a dock in Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England. It was built between 1904 and 1908, from land reclaimed during the construction of the Great Float.

==History==
The dock was designed by Anthony George Lyster. Construction began in 1905, from the land reclaimed during the construction of the Great Float. During its construction on 6 March 1909, a temporary dam collapsed, killing 14 navvies. This incident is now referred to as the Birkenhead Dock Disaster. The dock was opened in 1909, having warehouses on either side.

===The name &quot;Vittoria&quot;===
The dock is named after the Battle of Vittoria, fought on 21 June 1813.

An alternative view is that Vittoria Dock has derived its name as a tribute to the first ship to circumnavigate the globe, Magellan&#x27;s &quot;Vittoria&quot;. 
However, Magellan&#x27;s ship was named after the church of &quot;Santa María de la Victoria de Triana&quot;, therefore, this Vittoria naming may be questioned.

Vittoria Dock is sometimes incorrectly quoted as &#x27;Victoria Dock&#x27;, thought in reference to Queen Victoria. However, the wharf was originally known as Victoria, and the plans of 1843 include a Victoria Dock on the site. Although, when acquired by the Liverpool Corporation, the site may have been renamed to avoid confusion with Victoria Dock.

===In use===
Between 1937 and 1941, HMS &quot;Conway&quot;, a training ship, was based here. Between the 1920s and 1970s, the Vittoria Wharf terminal was operated by Clan Line Steamers Ltd. The southern quayside was operated by Blue Funnel Line Ltd., which loaded two or three ships each week, destined for the Far East. The Brocklebank Line, Houston Line and the Scottish Shire Line also used the dock. The dock was extended west in 1960, and fell into disuse as container shipping came into use.

When the Warship Preservation Trust closed in February 2006, most of its exhibits, which included the HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot; and wooden-hulled minesweeper HMS &quot;Bronington&quot;, were later moved to Vittoria Dock for safe storage.

==Future==
The dock is included in Peel Group&#x27;s £4.5bn Wirral Waters redevelopment. The Baseline Study of July 2008 has been endorsed by Wirral Borough Council. In February 2009 the initial stage of the planning application for the first major mixed-use development masterplan/quarter was submitted. The development would be expected to take up to 30 years.

<doc id="1146727" wikidata="Q919333" url="?curid=1146727" title="British Guiana 1c magenta">
<text>The British Guiana 1c magenta is regarded by many philatelists as the world&#x27;s most famous rare stamp. It was issued in limited numbers in British Guiana (now Guyana) in 1856, and only one specimen is now known to exist. It is the only major postage stamp ever issued in the United Kingdom or British Commonwealth that is not represented in Britain&#x27;s Royal Philatelic Collection.

It is imperforate, printed in black on magenta paper, and it features a sailing ship along with the colony&#x27;s Latin motto &quot;Damus Petimus Que Vicissim&quot; (We give and expect in return) in the middle. Four thin lines frame the ship. The stamp&#x27;s country of issue and value—rendered in black uppercase lettering—surround the frame.

Neil McKinnon, a local collector in Guiana, purchased the only known example of the stamp in 1873 after first declining to buy it. A Liverpool dealer, Thomas Ridpath, recognized its rarity and purchased it in 1878. Noted collector Philipp von Ferrary acquired the stamp that same year, and owned it in France for several decades. It was seized by the French government at the end of World War I, auctioned in Paris in 1922 for a world record sum, and then spent years in the hands of American owners. It was exhibited at the 1939–40 World&#x27;s Fair, and was also shown at the London International Stamp Exhibition in 1923. King George V saw the stamp at this exhibition, and is said to have declined an offer to own it, although he had previously sent his agent to the Paris auction.

With its sale in June 2014 to Stuart Weitzman for $9,480,000, the 1c magenta has broken the world record for a single stamp auction price a total of four times. The 2014 auction also made it the most expensive item, by weight and size, ever sold in history. The stamp was next sold in June 2021 to London stamp dealer and publishing company Stanley Gibbons PLC for $8,307,000.

==Background==
The 1c magenta was part of a series of three definitive stamps issued in 1856 and was intended for use on local newspapers. The other two stamps, a 4c magenta and 4c blue, were intended for letter postage. The issue came about through mischance. An anticipated delivery of stamps by ship did not arrive so the local postmaster, E. T. E. Dalton, authorized printers Joseph Baum and William Dallas, who were the publishers of the &quot;Official Gazette&quot; newspaper in Georgetown, to print an emergency issue of three stamps. Dalton gave some specifications about the design but the printer chose to add a ship image of their own design to the stamps. Dalton was not pleased with the result and as a safeguard against forgery ordered that all correspondence bearing the stamps be autographed by a post office clerk. This particular stamp was initialled E.D.W. by clerk Edmond D. Wight.

==Description and history==

Only one copy of the 1c stamp is known to exist. It is in used condition and has been cut in an octagonal shape. It is unknown why the four corners were clipped; both clipped and un-clipped examples remain of the 4-cent issue. A signature, in accordance with Dalton&#x27;s policy, can be seen on the left-hand side, along with a heavy postmark.

The stamp was bought on or before 4 April 1856, the date it is postmarked. It was discovered in 1873 by a 12-year-old Scottish schoolboy, Louis Vernon Vaughan, in the Guyanese county of Demerara (whose postmark the stamp bears), amongst his uncle&#x27;s letters. There was no record of it in his stamp catalogue so he sold it some weeks later for six shillings to a local collector, Neil Ross McKinnon. In 1878 McKinnon&#x27;s collection was sold to a Liverpool stamp dealer, Thomas Ridpath, for £120. Shortly afterwards in the same year, Thomas Ridpath sold the 1c to Philipp von Ferrary for about £150. Ferrary&#x27;s massive stamp collection was willed to a Berlin museum but following Ferrary&#x27;s death in 1917, the entire collection was taken by France as war reparations following the end of World War I.

Arthur Hind bought the stamp in Paris in April 1922, at one of the auctions of Ferrary&#x27;s possessions, for over $32,000—reportedly outbidding three kings, including George V, whose agent was at the sale. On 6 April 1922, during sale 3, lot 295, the stamp sold for 300,000 francs with a 17.5% French sales tax, making a total of 352,500 francs, the world record stamp sale. The price had been generally estimated at between 165,000 and 220,000 francs. The stamp&#x27;s first ever public viewing took place two days earlier, on the afternoon of Tuesday, April 4.

Hind enjoyed &quot;owning the world&#x27;s most valuable stamp,&quot; he &quot;freely gave interviews,&quot; and &quot;frequently loaned the stamp for exhibitions.&quot; It was shown at the London International Stamp Exhibition from 14 to 28 May 1923, an event opened by George V. Supposedly, Hind offered King George the stamp, who &quot;politely declined.&quot; Later, Hind &quot;recalled His Majesty congratulated him on his purchase.&quot; The exhibition marked the first time the stamp had been in Britain since 1878.

On 30 October 1935 it was offered for sale at Harmer Rooke &amp; Co auction 2704, lot 26, where a bid of £7,500 was received from Percival Loines Pemberton. However, the lot was withdrawn and returned to Mrs. Scala (formerly Mrs. Hind). In 1940, she offered it for private sale through the philately department of Macy&#x27;s department store in New York City. It was purchased for $40,000 by Fred &quot;Poss&quot; Small, an Australian-born engineer from Florida, who had wanted to own the stamp since he first heard about it as a boy. In acquiring it, Small completed a full set of stamps from British Guiana.

In 1970, Small auctioned his entire stamp collection (estimated to be worth $750,000), and the 1c stamp was acquired by a syndicate of Pennsylvanian investors, headed by Irwin Weinberg, who paid $280,000 for it and spent much of the decade exhibiting it in a worldwide tour. 

John E. du Pont bought the stamp for $935,000 in 1980, setting the world&#x27;s record for a single stamp price again. Subsequently, it was believed to have been locked in a bank vault while its owner was in prison. He died while still incarcerated on 9 December 2010.

Du Pont&#x27;s estate sold the stamp on 17 June 2014 at a Sotheby&#x27;s New York auction, sale number N09154, for $9,480,000, including buyer&#x27;s premium. It took only two minutes to sell to an anonymous bidder and was the fourth time the stamp had broken the world record for a single-stamp bid; this time, the sale broke the 1996 record of $2,300,000 for the Treskilling Yellow, an 1855 Swedish stamp. The purchaser has since identified himself as shoe designer and businessman Stuart Weitzman, who collected stamps as a child. 80 percent of the proceeds from the auction went to Bulgarian Valentin Yordanov, a retired Bulgarian wrestler, to whom Du Pont left the majority of his estate.

The stamp was put up for auction again at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York on 8 June 2021, where it sold for $8,307,000, falling short of the pre-sale estimate and the previous sale price. It was purchased by rare stamp dealership Stanley Gibbons, who placed it on display at their London shop in a specially-constructed zero-oxygen frame. Beginning November 8, 2021, individuals are able to purchase fractional ownership of the stamp from Stanley Gibbons. After his company purchased the stamp, Stanley Gibbons CEO Graham Shircore said &quot;we&#x27;re delighted to be welcoming it back on to British soil where we hope it will remain.&quot; 

== Owners and personal marks ==

Since 1856, several of the stamp&#x27;s owners have placed a personal mark on the rear, or verso, side of the stamp. In its 2021 auction catalogue note for the stamp, Sotheby&#x27;s described &quot;the eight marks of its keepers for the past one hundred and forty-three years,&quot; including the &quot;purple trefoil stamp of Philipp La Rénotière von Ferrary&quot; and the &quot;comet handstamp of Frederick Small.&quot; Finbar Kenny, who brokered the purchase of the stamp for Small, also left his initials. At least seven different individuals have left a mark on the reverse of the stamp.

It was said that infrared photos taken at the Smithsonian National Postal Museum in 2014 &quot;revealed a four-leaf clover beneath the seventeen-point star&quot; design on the stamps&#x27; reverse; the star was said to have been applied by Ann Hind to &quot;obscure her husband&#x27;s mark,&quot; a cloverleaf design that bears his initials, &quot;AH.&quot; Sotheby&#x27;s likewise described this in 2014 as &quot;perhaps a seventeen-point star handstamp on reverse used to obscure the cloverleaf of [Hind&#x27;s] husband,&quot; but in their 2021 listing, the auction house simply described it as part of Arthur Hind&#x27;s mark. As part of their 2021 listing, Sotheby&#x27;s also included an image of an 1851 postal cover bearing the same star design stamp, the only other example known, referring to it as the &quot;&#x27;Hind&#x27; seventeen point star.&quot; In their exhibition of the stamp, Stanley Gibbons listed the seventeen point handstamp as part of Arthur Hind&#x27;s mark.

Most recently, Stuart Weitzman added his initials and a line drawing of a stiletto shoe in pencil, causing some controversy in philatelic circles. See below for a list of the stamp&#x27;s owners, their nationalities, and the marks they left, if any, on the stamp&#x27;s reverse:
==Controversies==
At one point, it was suggested that the 1c stamp was merely a &quot;doctored&quot; copy of the magenta 4c stamp of the same series, a stamp very similar to the 1c stamp in appearance. These claims were disproven.

In the 1920s a rumour developed that a second copy of the stamp had been discovered by then-owner, Arthur Hind, who quietly purchased the supposed second copy to subsequently destroy it. The rumour has not been substantiated.

In 1999, a second 1c stamp was claimed to have been discovered in Bremen, Germany. The stamp was owned by Peter Winter, who is widely known for producing many forgeries of classic philatelic items, printed as facsimiles on modern paper. The stamp was twice examined and found to be a fake by the Royal Philatelic Society London. In their opinion, this specimen is an altered 4c magenta stamp.

==Public display==

The stamp was displayed at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the 1956 Fifth International Philatelic Exhibition (FIPEX) in the New York Coliseum, in Australia in 1963, at New York&#x27;s 1964 Centenary International Stamp exhibition (CIPEX), in London in 1965 and at Toronto&#x27;s Canadian Philatelic Exhibition (CAPEX) in 1978.

In November 2014, the National Postal Museum of the Smithsonian Institution announced that the then-anonymous owner of the stamp had agreed to display it at the museum in Washington, D.C., beginning 4 June 2015 and running through 2 December 2018. Next to the Postal Museum exhibit is a copy of a Donald Duck comic book, &quot;The Gilded Man&quot;, (OS 422) from 1952 whose central plot element revolves around Donald and his nephews, Huey, Louie and Dewey, going to British Guiana to try to find another copy of the stamp. The comic is written and drawn by Carl Barks.

The stamp was exhibited in the Court of Honor at World Stamp Show-NY 2016 in New York City from 28 May to 3 June 2016.

Shortly after the 2021 sale, the British stamp dealing and philatelic publishing firm of Stanley Gibbons announced themselves as the buyers of the stamp. Beginning November 8, 2021, individuals are able to purchase fractional ownership of the stamp from Stanley Gibbons. From the same month to December, the stamp is exhibited by Stanley Gibbons at their headquarters at 399 Strand, London. It recently appeared in September 2023 at the London Stampex exhibition, and during November—December 2023 in Bangkok.

<text>Industrial Symphony No. 1: The Dream of the Broken Hearted is a 1990 avant-garde concert performance directed by David Lynch, with music by Angelo Badalamenti and Julee Cruise. It stars Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern, Michael J. Anderson, and Cruise. The film, whose duration is 50 minutes, was described as a musical.

==Background==
When David Lynch studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia (PAFA), he made a series of complex mosaics in geometric shapes which he called &quot;Industrial Symphonies&quot;.

The play was originally presented on stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City as part of the New Music America Festival on November 10, 1989. Footage from these performances was used for the home video release.

==Cast==
*Nicolas Cage as Heartbreaker
*Laura Dern as Heartbroken Woman
*Julee Cruise as The Dreamself of the Heartbroken Woman
*Michael J. Anderson as Woodsman / Twin A

==Content==
The presentation opens with Cage and Dern engaging in a telephone conversation, the gist of which is that he is breaking up with her, to her great sorrow. Though they are never named as such, the two characters bear a striking resemblance to Sailor and Lula from Lynch&#x27;s movie &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;. The rest of the play is a hallucinatory &quot;dream&quot; that the Heartbroken Woman has.

The show takes place on a stage, the main props being a tall metal girder-like structure, and an abandoned shell of a car, with flickering lights and cacophonous sounds used to create disturbing, nightmarish effects. Much use is made of actors suspended from ropes, flying and falling, as well as dancers.

== Music ==
Julee Cruise sings on tracks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10. These songs are all from her 1989 debut album, &quot;Floating into the Night&quot;, apart from track 1, which is from her 1993 album, &quot;The Voice of Love&quot;. They are the normal, studio recordings; the songs are mimed. Her voice can also be heard in track 6, and she gets pushed into the trunk of the car. In track 8, the trunk opens and she sings from it, her face superimposed on a TV screen. Two of Julee&#x27;s recordings, &quot;Rockin&#x27; Back Inside My Heart&quot; and &quot;The World Spins,&quot; were also featured in episode 14 of the second season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (for which Cruise recorded a vocal version of the theme). Another song from this performance, the instrumental &quot;I&#x27;m Hurt Bad,&quot; is played on the diner&#x27;s jukebox in the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; pilot. &quot;The World Spins&quot; is also performed by Cruise in episode 17 of &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;.

Michael J. Anderson (known for his role as the small, dancing Man From Another Place on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) is featured on track 3, patiently sawing a log of wood to Badalamenti&#x27;s discordant music. He is also part of the stage ensemble on track 5 (instrumental), along with a tall, demonic reindeer-like figure. Finally, on track 7, he reiterates the opening dialogue between Cage and Dern, accompanied by a clarinet player and a non-speaking actress playing Dern&#x27;s part.

Track 9 is wholly instrumental, with a background of dolls being lowered from the roof on strings.

==Track list==
#&quot;Up in Flames&quot;
#&quot;I Float Alone&quot;
#&quot;The Black Sea&quot;
#&quot;Into the Night&quot;
#&quot;I&#x27;m Hurt Bad&quot;
#&quot;Pinky&#x27;s Bubble Egg (The Twins Spoke)&quot;
#&quot;The Dream Conversation&quot;
#&quot;Rockin&#x27; Back Inside My Heart&quot;
#&quot;The Final Battle&quot;
#&quot;The World Spins&quot;

==Home media==
The show was released on VHS in 1990, on LaserDisc in 1991, and on DVD on November 18, 2008, as part of the &quot;David Lynch: The Lime Green Set&quot; collection, which featured the performance in both full-frame and widescreen versions. The widescreen version has less visual information due to the top and bottom of the footage being cut off so that it fills up the entire screen of a widescreen TV.

<text>Hi-Fi Revival is the fifth studio album released by The O.C. Supertones. It was the first of three sessions the Supertones recorded in Franklin, Tennessee at Dark Horse Studios. Matt Morginsky and Ethan Luck lived together at this time and demoed over 50 songs for Hi-Fi Revival in their basement. 17 of the un-used songs made it on to their side-project album, Grand Incredible. The rest of the demos were never released. &quot;CCM&quot; characterized the sound on this album as displaying stripped down ska core rhythms, with the horn section now &quot;providing color instead of the dominant sound.&quot;

<doc id="1146792" wikidata="Q3138805" url="?curid=1146792" title="Nick Clooney">
<text>Nicholas Joseph Clooney (born January 13, 1934) is an American journalist, anchorman, and television host. He is the brother of singers Rosemary Clooney and Betty Clooney and the father of actor George Clooney.

==Early life==

Clooney was born in Maysville, Kentucky, the son of Marie Frances (née Guilfoyle; 1904–1972) and Andrew Joseph Clooney (1902–1974). He was one of five children. His father was of Irish and German descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. While serving as a Corporal in the U.S. Army, he was a disc jockey in the American Forces Network in Germany, hosting the shows &quot;Music in the Air&quot; and &quot;Melody-Go-Round&quot;. He then moved to California for a try at show business. When that did not work out, Clooney moved to Ohio, where he met Nina Warren when she was a contestant in a beauty pageant he was judging; they married in August 1959. In addition to his son, George, Nick Clooney has a daughter named Adelia (known as Ada).

==Broadcasting and journalism career==
Clooney had an eight-year stint (1958–1966) at WKYT-TV in Lexington, Kentucky, then went to Ohio to host his own TV show, &quot;The Nick Clooney Show&quot;, first in Columbus, Ohio, for WLWC television in 1968, then for Cincinnati&#x27;s WCPO-TV in 1969, and finally with its greatest degree of success for crosstown rival WKRC-TV through the early 1970s. &quot;The Nick Clooney Show&quot; was a local morning show, with a variety and talk-show format. In December 1974, he gained his first national fame by hosting the ABC daytime game show &quot;The Money Maze&quot;. Broadcast nationally on ABC at 4 p.m., WKRC-TV (at the time an ABC affiliate) delayed &quot;The Money Maze&quot; so it could be seen back-to-back with &quot;The Nick Clooney Show&quot; at 10:30 and 11 a.m., respectively.

After ABC canceled &quot;The Money Maze&quot; on July 4, 1975, Clooney returned to WKRC-TV and became the station&#x27;s news director and lead anchor. As a journalist, he is probably best remembered for his coverage of the 1977 Beverly Hills Supper Club fire and its aftermath, which spanned several years. Many people in the region first heard about the fire from Clooney when WKRC interrupted its Saturday night prime-time schedule to broadcast news of the fire. Clooney pursued a hard news focus that was quite different from the sensationalism often seen on local television. Under his leadership, WKRC-TV became a solid #1 in the local news ratings, dethroning CBS affiliate WCPO-TV, which had controlled ratings for more than two decades under Al Schottelkotte&#x27;s leadership.

After leaving WKRC in 1984, Clooney then worked in Los Angeles, California, as the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. co-anchor at KNBC. He returned again to WKRC-TV in the late 1980s, but by that time, NBC affiliate WLWT was number one in the late newscast, with former Cincinnati mayor Jerry Springer as its main anchor; Clooney was not able to lead WKRC back to ratings leadership it enjoyed in the past. He moved on to Salt Lake City, Utah for several years to anchor and help launch the news operation of the market&#x27;s Fox station KSTU with its 9 p.m. newscast. Then in 1994, Clooney worked a short stint as a news anchor for NBC affiliate WGRZ-TV in Buffalo, New York. 
He resurfaced nationally in television as a host and researcher for the cable channel American Movie Classics, where he introduced and presented backgrounds of classic movies, along with Bob Dorian. In 1999, he returned to his former radio home WSAI in Cincinnati, starting as afternoon host September 13, then moving to mornings in November to replace Bob Braun, who had health problems.

Despite his long association with WKRC-TV and helping it become one of the dominant stations in the Cincinnati area alongside WCPO-TV, Clooney has been critical of WKRC-TV&#x27;s current owners, the Sinclair Broadcast Group, over their conservative viewpoints and their &quot;must runs&quot; during its stations&#x27; local newscasts including WKRC-TV. Clooney was critical of Sinclair&#x27;s journalistic responsibility promos during the first presidency of Donald Trump, stating that he would have &quot;quit and become a cab driver&quot; if station management had forced him into reading it on the air.

==2004 Congressional campaign==

Clooney ran as a Democrat in the 2004 election for a seat in the House of Representatives representing Kentucky&#x27;s 4th Congressional District. His opponent for the open seat was Republican Geoff Davis. Clooney was recruited to run by Ken Lucas, the outgoing Democratic congressman who had held onto the conservative district with his moderate views. With his name recognition and well-publicized endorsement from Lucas, Clooney was a big favorite to keep the seat in Democratic hands.

Early in 2004, Davis fought through a (sometimes rough) three-way Republican primary. Despite a commanding early lead, when the national media began to report on the electoral contest (due to his famous son George Clooney), his Republican opponents began using the phrase &quot;Hollywood vs the Heartland&quot; to describe the race. Clooney&#x27;s lead began to disappear and he was dealt a blow when both &quot;The Kentucky Enquirer&quot; and the &quot;Community Press&quot; newspapers endorsed Davis.

Clooney lost 44% to 54%. During his concession speech, he said his short career in politics was over. He went back to writing a column for &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; three times a week, covering a wide range of topics, until the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s discontinuation at the end of 2007.

==Post-Congressional run==
In 2006, Clooney and his son George traveled to Darfur, Sudan, and filmed a documentary, &quot;A Journey to Darfur&quot;, which was broadcast on American cable TV as well as in United Kingdom and France. In 2008, it was released on DVD with the proceeds from its sale being donated to the International Rescue Committee to help the people of Darfur.

Clooney became an activist for Darfur. He has done several open forums and speeches at local high schools in Ohio and Kentucky, and has participated in different rallies for Darfur. On March 16, 2007, following a Darfur rally, Clooney was awarded an honorary Class of 1952 diploma from St. Xavier High School, the high school he attended in Cincinnati before moving to California. On October 11, 2007, Clooney visited Turpin High School in Cincinnati to talk to students about Darfur. The University of Kentucky announced that it would present him with an honorary degree at its 2007 commencement.

Clooney served as the host of the Dayton Literary Peace Prize awards ceremony in both 2007 and 2008.

In fall 2008, Clooney joined the faculty at American University in Washington, D.C. as American University School of Communication and Newseum Distinguished Journalist in Residence. Clooney&#x27;s appointment is part of a long-term partnership between the School of Communication and the Newseum, the interactive museum of news in Washington, D.C. As part of the school-Newseum partnership, Clooney hosted the fifth annual AU School of Communication-Newseum Reel Journalism Film Festival and other events at the Newseum. &quot;After a news career that stretches back to the Eisenhower administration, I&#x27;m looking forward to joining American University&#x27;s School of Communication and the Newseum to work with a new generation of prospective journalists,&quot; said Clooney.

Clooney taught Opinion Writing in fall 2008, and in spring 2009, he taught Films that Changed Us, a new course based on his book, &quot;The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen&quot; (Atria, 2002). The book analyzes the significance of such iconic American films as &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;The Graduate&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

Clooney was the commencement speaker for the University of Cincinnati on June 8, 2012, and was awarded an honorary degree the following day.

In 2014, Nick Clooney appeared in &quot;The Monuments Men&quot; which was directed by his son, George Clooney, who played one of the leading characters, Stokes. Nick Clooney played the older Stokes visiting Bruges, Belgium, years later to see the Madonna, which was one of the many treasures rescued by the Monuments Men.

In 2021, Nick Clooney joined the Sons of the American Revolution.

<text>Kitty Kelly (born Sue O&#x27;Neil; April 27, 1902 – June 29, 1968), was an American stage and film character actress.

==Biography==
Born in New York City in 1902, Kelly was best known as a member of the Ziegfeld Follies and her radio hosting with Columbia Broadcasting. One of her best-remembered roles is that of Lt. Ethel Armstrong in the 1943 Paramount wartime drama &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot;. However, she is probably better remembered in the 1935 &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedy short &quot;Beginner&#x27;s Luck&quot;.

After the war, she appeared in many TV series, including &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, on which she made four guest appearances, including the role of Millie Foster in the 1958 episode &quot;The Case of the Rolling Bones.&quot;

Kelly also performed in England.

Kelly died from cancer on June 29, 1968, in Hollywood, California.

<text>The Portuguese Bend region is the largest area of natural vegetation remaining on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, in Los Angeles County, California. Though once slated for development including the projected route of Crenshaw Boulevard, the area is geologically unstable and is unsuitable for building.

==History of inhabitants==

===Native Americans===
The peninsula was the homeland of the Tongva-Gabrieliño Native Americans. In other areas of the Los Angeles Basin archeological sites date back 8,000 years. Their first contact with Europeans was in 1542 with João Cabrilho (Juan Cabrillo), the explorer who also was the first to write of them. Chowigna and Suangna were two Tongva settlements of many in the peninsula area, which was also a departure point for their rancherias on the Channel Islands.

===Spanish and Mexican era===
In 1846 Jose Dolores Sepulveda and José Loreto received a Mexican land grant from Alta California Governor Pío Pico for a parcel from the huge original 1784 Spanish land grant Rancho San Pedro of Manuel Dominguez. It was named Rancho de los Palos Verdes, or &quot;ranch of the green sticks&quot;, which was used primarily as a cattle ranch.

===American era===
By 1882 ownership of the land had passed from the Sepulveda through various mortgage holders to Jotham Bixby of Rancho Los Cerritos, who leased the land to Japanese farmers. Early in the 20th century most of Bixby&#x27;s land was sold to a consortium of New York investors who created The Palos Verdes Project and began marketing land on the peninsula for small horse ranches and residential communities.

===The whaling era===
The name Portuguese Bend comes from the whaling activities of Portuguese whalemen from the Azores. An Azorean shore whaling captain named José Machado brought shore whaling to this bend in the coastline north of San Pedro Bay after the closure of the San Pedro Bay whaling station on Deadman&#x27;s Island in or about 1862. He brought with him a crew of Azorean whalemen. In 1864, Captain Clark moved his operations to San Simeon Bay.
In 1869, the station was operated by the John Brown Whaling Company (&quot;Los Angeles Star&quot;, March 13, 1869). In 1874, Captain Frank Anderson (né Anasio) brought a crew from Port Harford in San Luis Obispo County. His operation at Portuguese Bend lasted from 1874 to 1877. During three winters (December–April) he obtained 2,166 barrels of oil from trying out the blubber flensed from gray whales he had caught on their annual migration along the California coast. He abandoned the station thereafter, establishing another further north at Pigeon Point. An 1888 U.S. Fish Commission Report stated that whales had been caught from Portuguese Bend as late as 1884, suggesting another party utilized the area for whaling up until that date. The Old Whaling Station there was designated a California Historic Landmark (No. 381) on Jan. 3, 1944.

===The Vanderlip era===
Frank A. Vanderlip, Sr. (1864–1937) was known as the &quot;Father of Palos Verdes&quot;. He purchased the 16,000 acre Rancho de los Palos Verdes from Jotham Bixby in 1913. In 1916, he built the Vanderlip estates near the Portuguese Bend area of Palos Verdes, California. His daughter-in-law Elin Vanderlip maintained residence at the estate until her death in 2009 and her husband&#x27;s ashes are spread on the grounds. The Vanderlips championed many of the landmarks in Rancho Palos Verdes, notably Wayfarers Chapel (The church was designed by Lloyd Wright (son of Frank Lloyd Wright) in the late 1940s and was built between 1949 and 1951.), Marineland of the Pacific, Portuguese Bend Riding Club (featured in the movie Chinatown), Marymount College, Palos Verdes and Chadwick School.

In 1949 Kelvin Cox Vanderlip, Sr. built the Portuguese Bend Beach Club (a gated beach house community The houses were built on lots leased for 25 years and were the typical 1940s weekend places where people went to have a quiet time at the beach. Back then there was a clubhouse, restaurant, paddle tennis courts, 50-foot swimming pool, a sandy beach, and a 485-foot long pier where boats could tie up.

==Geology and landslides==

During the late Pleistocene, the Palos Verdes hills were an offshore island. The island later became a peninsula, when the region between the island and the mainland filled with alluvial deposits from the mountain ranges near the Los Angeles basin. The Palos Verdes Hills are part of an uplifted block, with a northwest trend, bounded on the northeast by the Palos Verdes fault zone. Most of the movement along this fault is dip-slip, resulting in an uplift of about 1 km of the Palos Verdes Hills relative to the Los Angeles basin.

The Palos Verdes Peninsula consists of several cores and sedimentary rock.
===Surficial deposits===
Surficial deposits of the Palos Verdes Hills consists of stratigraphic layers, in order from oldest to youngest: 
*Late Pleistocene stream terrace gravel
*Late Pleistocene marine terrace deposits
*Late Quaternary dune sand
*Late Quaternary soil
*Late Quaternary talus
*Late Quaternary non-marine terrace cover
*Late Quaternary slope wash and creep deposits
*Holocene beach deposits
*Holocene alluvium.

The ground surface in the central and southern parts of the district is low and hummocky, reflecting the location of numerous late Quaternary landslides. These hills form an elongated topographic dome that rises from sea level to altitudes of more than 430 meters.

===Landslides===
====Description and characterization====
The Portuguese Bend landslide occupies an area of roughly two square miles and denotes reoccurring movement on the eastern side of a series of prehistoric landslides. The city of Rancho Palos Verdes sits on four out of five sub-slides of the Ancient Altamira Landslide Complex, including Portuguese Bend Landslide Complex, the Abalone Cove Landslide Complex and the Klondike Canyon Landslide Complex, and Beach Club Landslides. The complex covers approximately 240 acres.

====History====
The Palos Verdes Peninsula landslides and ground failures may have roots as long as 250,000 years ago. Certain landslides span with an average thickness of . Ground failure occurs on an overall smooth surface approximately below the surface, and over the years has been due to seaward-dipping strata, rock weakness and continual coastal erosion. Prehistoric landslides are believed to be so extensive that they destroyed the formation of higher wave-cut benches. 

====1956 Portuguese Bend Landslide====
The Portuguese Bend area has a history of landslides. Beginning in September 1956 and continuing until early 1957, the area experienced a landslide concurrent with the construction of a road (the Crenshaw Boulevard extension, south of Crest Road) along the top of an ancient landslide complex. During this construction, excavated sediment was dumped onto the upper slopes of the complex along with hundreds of thousands of gallons of water which lubricated a layer of bentonite clay formed by the subsurface weathering of volcanic rock called tuff. This layer of bentonite slants down to the Pacific Ocean enabling down-slope movement. A 1958 video newsreel showed the effects of the movement: 140 of the 170 homes in the area were destroyed or displaced. A successful lawsuit was filed by area homeowners in 1961; the plaintiffs won $10 million in compensation against Los Angeles County, the party responsible for the road construction. 

Another possible contributing cause of the 1956 sliding was the construction of hundreds of homes on and above the unstable rock and soil in the early 1950s prior to the slide. Home development on the Peninsula has been a factor in coastline ground movement for several decades. Residential sewage treatment facilities (cesspool or septic system), lawns, gardens, and others may contribute to ground shifts in the area. It is expected that the homes that remained after the 1956 landslide and the ones built since then would have above ground water and sewage lines available to reduce property damage.

====Abalone Cove Slide====

From 1974 to 1978, an 80 acre landslide occurred in the Abalone Cove area. The lower part of the landslide started to move in February 1974. The &quot;Abalone Cove Slide&quot; was moving so slowly that geologists did not verify that it was an actual slide until 1976, after it had damaged roughly twenty homes.

The upper part of the slide may have started to shift in the spring of 1978. That year, the city restricted building new homes in areas impacted by the landslides, &quot;Landslide Moratorium Map.&quot; Since 1980, efforts to control landslide movement have involved removing ground water from the landslide mass.

====Klondike Canyon Landslide Complex====

The Klondike Canyon has been noted for landslides. Renewed movement occurred in 1979, and a Geologic Hazard Abatement Districts was created to study the Klondike Canyon landslides in 1982.

====Beach Club Landslide====
The Portuguese Beach Club landslide is a minor slide within the area&#x27;s landslide complex. In 2024, residents of Seaview and the Beach Club filed a lawsuit against the City of Rancho Palos Verdes.

====Portuguese Bend and Seaview Landslide====

Since Spring 2023, there has been noticeable land movement and collateral damage in the Portuguese Bend Beach Club, Portuguese Bend Community Association, and Seaview neighborhoods. Several miles of trails have closed in the Abalone Cove Reserve, Filiorum Reserve, Forrestal Reserve, and Portuguese Bend Reserve areas.

In September 2024, more than 200 homeowners had to evacuate the Portuguese Bend and Seaview areas. The city of Rancho Palos Verdes issued an evacuation warning for residents in response to landslides that are moving at a rate of three-fourths to one foot per week. Gas to the Portuguese Bend neighborhood has been shutoff since August 2024. For safety reason, local utility companies planned to terminate all electricity for impacted residents.
On September 3, 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the City of Rancho Palos Verdes. The city has extended a construction moratorium for the landslide areas until October 2025.

==Habitat==

The geographical location and geological history of the peninsula make the remaining habitat extremely valuable for ecological and other scientific reasons. The peninsula, which was an island with the Palos Verdes Hills in recent geological time, has close floral and faunal similarities to the California Channel Islands. This feature makes the Portuguese Bend Landslide area a natural research laboratory for the study of island biogeography and evolutionary ecology.

The vegetation found in the area is coastal sage scrub. This plant community supports a surprising number and variety of species. There are at least three races of birds resident on the peninsula that are found nowhere else except the Channel Islands. These are the insular forms of the orange-crowned warbler, Pacific-slope flycatcher, and Allen&#x27;s hummingbird. The same phenomenon has been documented for plant species. A species of live-forever, &quot;Dudleya virens&quot;, which is native to the Channel Islands and the Palos Verdes Peninsula, is found near Point Vicente Lighthouse.

The area also serves as habitat to many migrating birds moving through the region in fall and spring. The Peninsula is a headland that juts into the Pacific Ocean several miles further than the surrounding coastline. Migrating terrestrial and shore birds, flying over the open ocean on their north–south migration along the Pacific Flyway, spot this headland and stop to rest and feed. Many of these birds will stay and spend the winter in the area. Thus, the geographic position makes this habitat much more important than might otherwise be expected.

In general, the area has been lightly disturbed, and much natural vegetation remains. Intense disturbances, in the form of heavy off-road vehicle and pedestrian use, have been limited. Grazing also took place at one time.

==In popular culture==
The fictional Santa Rosita Beach State Park, with its signature crisscrossed palm trees comprising &quot;the Big W&quot; amidst lush surroundings and featured in the 1963 comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,&quot; was a landscaped set built in 1962 in the back yard of the Harden Gatehouse on Palos Verdes Dr. S, in Rancho Palos Verdes. As of 2016, all of the &quot;Big W&quot; palms were gone.

<doc id="1146803" wikidata="Q6548475" url="?curid=1146803" title="Lily Dale, New York">
<text>Lily Dale is a hamlet, connected with the Spiritualist movement, located in the Town of Pomfret on the east side of Cassadaga Lake, next to the Village of Cassadaga. Located in southwestern New York State, it is one hour southwest of Buffalo, halfway to the Pennsylvania border.

Lily Dale&#x27;s year-round population is estimated to be 275. Each year approximately 22,000 visitors come for classes, workshops, public church services and mediumship demonstrations, lectures, and private appointments with mediums. In recent years, guest lecturers have included Lisa Williams, Dee Wallace, members of &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;, Tibetan monks, James Van Praagh, Dr. Wayne Dyer, and Deepak Chopra.

Lily Dale was incorporated in 1879 as Cassadaga Lake Free Association, a camp and meeting place for Spiritualists and Freethinkers. The name was changed to The City of Light in 1903 and finally to Lily Dale Assembly in 1906. The purpose of Lily Dale was to further the science, philosophy, and religion of Spiritualism.

Lily Dale was featured in the HBO documentary &quot;No One Dies in Lily Dale&quot;. Most of the hamlet was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.

==Geography and features==
Lily Dale is located on the east side of Upper Cassadaga Lake, one of four lakes that comprise the Cassadaga Lakes system, at an elevation of approximately 1325 ft. Its coordinates are 42°21&#x27;06&quot; North, 79°19&#x27;27&quot; West (42.351725, −79.324211). Its main route of access is New York State Route 60, which is located about 0.5 miles east of the hamlet and runs north and south to the cities of Dunkirk and Jamestown.

Leolyn Woods is a 10-acre tract of old growth forest on the grounds of the community of Lily Dale. Lily Dale Assembly charges a fee for admission during its summer season but it is free and open to the public at other times of year. The woodlot is small but contains some of the most accessible very old, large trees in the region, including eastern white pine standing 135 feet tall. Other species of big trees include northern red oak, eastern hemlock, red maple, sugar maple, cucumber magnolia, and black cherry. Some trees are estimated to range in age from 200 to 400 years.

==Spiritualism and the Lily Dale community==
Lily Dale became the largest center of the Spiritualist movement as other similar organizations went into decline. Other communities such as Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp (Florida) and Camp Chesterfield (Indiana) were founded on similar principles and are still active organizations. The Fox Cottage of the Fox sisters fame was moved from Hydesville, New York and transported to Lily Dale in 1915 although on September 21, 1955, it was destroyed by fire.

Lily Dale hosts the headquarters of the National Spiritualist Association of Churches (NSAC), founded in 1893: the NSAC&#x27;s first president, Harrison D. Barrett, was himself a Lily Dale resident.

A large population of people associated with Spiritualism reside in Lily Dale year round. Television mediums Lisa Williams and Michelle Whitedove have homes here.

==The Lily Dale Spiritualist Assembly==
The Lily Dale Spiritualist Assembly holds year round meetings and provides seminars on topics such as mediumship, spiritualist studies and topics within the subject of the paranormal. Well-known speakers such as Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer and John Edward have frequently appeared at Lily Dale. This private community is home to The Marion Skidmore Library, Lily Dale Museum, its own Volunteer Fire Department, and also is the location of the already mentioned headquarters of The National Spiritualist Association of Churches.

Lily Dale contains 160 private residences, two hotels, guest houses, Spiritualist and New Age bookstores, two eateries, and a café. Free Summer Program booklets announce events such as mediumship demonstrations, religious services, workshops, thought exchange meetings, and healing services. Visitors can also find camp grounds for either a tent or Recreation Vehicles, picnic grounds, and a lake front beach for swimming and sunbathing. Admission on Sunday mornings is waived to allow for church attendance.

==In popular culture==

Lily Dale is the backdrop for a series of young adult paranormal novels by &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author Wendy Corsi Staub, who grew up a few miles from Lily Dale, New York. To date, the series includes four titles published by Walker Books for Young Readers: &quot;Lily Dale: Awakening&quot;, &quot;Lily Dale: Believing&quot;, &quot;Lily Dale: Connecting&quot; and &quot;Lily Dale: Discovering&quot;. Staub has also written an adult thriller set in Lily Dale entitled &quot;In the Blink of an Eye&quot;, published by Kensington Books in 2002, and currently writes the Lily Dale Mysteries, an adult spin-off series featuring new characters as well as several from the original. The first three books are &quot;Nine Lives,&quot; &quot;Something Buried, Something Blue,&quot; and &quot;Dead of Winter,&quot; with two additional titles coming soon.

Lily Dale was the setting in the fictional TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot; in Season 7 episode 7 called &quot;The Mentalists.&quot;

<doc id="1146817" wikidata="Q1203370" url="?curid=1146817" title="Misato Katsuragi">
<text>is a fictional character from the Gainax-created media franchise &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. In the eponymous anime television series, Misato is head of the operations department of the special agency Nerv, and is in charge of directing and devising war strategies needed to defeat mysterious beings named Angels. Due to childhood emotional traumas, she developed a frivolous, exuberant character and a disordered lifestyle. The character also appears in the franchise&#x27;s animated feature films and related media, including video games, the original net animation &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.

For the creation of the character, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; director Hideaki Anno took inspiration from his personality. Misato is also inspired by several real-life figures and other anime characters, including Usagi Tsukino from &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;. Critics have drawn parallels between Misato&#x27;s characterization and concepts of philosophers and psychologists such as Carl Gustav Jung, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Friedrich Nietzsche; Misato&#x27;s feelings for her father have been linked to Jung&#x27;s Electra complex, her personal philosophy to Schopenhauer&#x27;s hedgehog dilemma, and her psychology to the Dionysian spirit postulated by Nietzsche.

Misato has been widely popular with audiences and has appeared at the top of popularity polls. Some critics have contrasted her histrionic personality and sexual overtones with her 14-year-old subordinate and &quot;Evangelion&quot; protagonist Shinji Ikari; others have appreciated her spontaneity, tenacity, and endearment. She has also inspired merchandise and other subsequent anime characters.

==Conception==

The franchise&#x27;s creator Hideaki Anno initially proposed to include a female protagonist in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, a young woman similar to Asuka Langley Soryu accompanied by a female soldier in a &quot;big sister&quot; role similar to Kōichirō Ōta&#x27;s character from Anno&#x27;s previous work &quot;GunBuster&quot;. At the request of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the series&#x27; character designer, the initial scenario was changed and Shinji Ikari, a male character, became the protagonist; ideas for the &quot;older sister&quot; character went into what would become Misato. As with other &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; characters, the character&#x27;s name was inspired by a Japanese Imperial Navy ship, the aircraft carrier &quot;Katsuragi&quot;, and Misato Izumi, a female character from Minako Narita&#x27;s manga &quot;Aitsu&quot;. To outline her personality, Anno took inspiration from Usagi Tsukino, the 14-year-old protagonist of the series &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;, thinking of Misato as an adult version of Usagi. Sadamoto also drew Misato taking his cue from Usagi&#x27;s character design and picking up her hair. The characters&#x27; aesthetic similarities were emphasized by the choice of Kotono Mitsuishi, the original performer of Usagi, as Misato&#x27;s voice actress.

For her facial features, the staff took inspiration from Fujiko Mine from the anime &quot;Lupin III&quot; and Japanese writer Aya Sugimoto. Sadamoto tried to give Misato a &quot;girl next door&quot; role; she was originally thought of as a fashion-conscious woman who constantly changes her clothing and apparently unsuited to military life; she was also conceived as emotional, stubborn and frivolous, and able, if forced by events, to sleep with all of the men at Nerv. The artist, inspired by the clothes worn by racers, decided to portray her with motorcyclist dresses. As a motoring enthusiast, he also poured his passion into the character, depicting her as an admirer of sports cars. It was his idea to equip her with a modified Renault Alpine A310, which Ikuto Yamashita designed, as a nod to the first episode of &quot;Lupin III&quot;, in which a Renault Alpine A110 appears. In the seventh episode, it was decided to have Misato drive a red Ferrari 328 GTS, while in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; series she drives a Mazda Cosmo Sport 110.

During the production of the series, Anno read romance novels written by women so he could better understand their feelings and make Misato&#x27;s characterization more realistic. He also relied on his personality, as well as with all characters in the series. The staff also relied on Anno to create the room and the character&#x27;s handwriting. Anno himself stated during the production of the series: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what will happen to Shinji, Misato or Rei. I don&#x27;t know where life will take them. Because I don&#x27;t know where life is taking the staff of the production.&quot;

Several character-centered fanservice scenes were added in the early episodes, particularly exploiting the &quot;Gainax bounce&quot;, a jerking of the female characters&#x27; breasts which had been used in &quot;Daicon IV&quot; and other previous Gainax works. At the end of almost all post-credit previews of the episodes, the authors also inserted Misato&#x27;s voice shouting &quot;Service, service!&quot; or equivalent expressions, promising more fanservice to the &quot;otaku&quot; audience. This was removed from the second half of the series, which has more-adult and violent content than the first half. In the same episodes, Anno included some sex scenes, breaking a taboo in Japanese television, although &quot;Evangelion&quot; was broadcast on TV Tokyo in a protected time-slot, with the idea of wanting to show the audience, and more particularly children, that sex and violence are an integral part of human life.

In the twentieth episode, Anno introduced an implied sequence with a long off-screen shot of Misato uttering verses of pleasure and arguing while having sex with her lover, Ryōji Kaji. The character&#x27;s words were left up to Mitsuishi&#x27;s sensibilities; the script had only Anno&#x27;s direction that read, &quot;Mitsuishi, I look forward to working with you&quot;. For the series finale, he decided instead to have Misato die in an armed confrontation and inserted a scene in which her bloody corpse is glimpsed for a few seconds; due to time constraints, the main plot of the series was abandoned and the episode script was quickly rewritten. The corpse scene was revived in 1997 for the film &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion&quot;, a remake of the classic series finale. Anno, while facing criticism, defended himself by saying:
===Voice actors===
In Japanese dubbing, Misato is played by Japanese voice actress Kotono Mitsuishi. Like other &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; voice actors, Hideaki Anno chose Mitsuishi because of her Misato-like personality during a dinner. To draw parallels between them, the writers decided to match the birthdays and blood types of the character and her voice actress. Mitsuishi found the role both pleasing and difficult, because Misato cannot easily talk about her feelings. According to Mitsuishi, &quot;During scenes where her feelings exploded or she poured out her heart, I also became a bit over-emotional ... My hands shook and it took all my might to keep the script I was holding from rustling and making noise&quot;. She cried while reading the script of the penultimate episode. For the character&#x27;s last scene in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, in which Misato says goodbye to Shinji by leading him into an elevator, Mitsuishi received approval as early as the first cut.

Mitsuishi reprised the role for the video game &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd&quot; and the film tetralogy &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;, produced ten years after the conclusion of the classic series. During the recording of the first chapter &quot;&quot; (2007), Mitsuishi was asked to strain her voice to sound younger due to the time elapsed between the works. For the third chapter in the saga &quot;&quot; (2012), which is set fourteen years after the first, Hideaki Anno asked her to act naturally and to be as cold as possible. Working on &quot;You Can (Not) Redo&quot;, Mitsuishi asked the production what had happened to Misato but no-one gave her an explanation; she assumed something terrible had happened to the character and read her own lines as though everything was Shinji&#x27;s fault. In the concluding chapter of the saga &quot;&quot; (2021), Anno used theatrical techniques to ensure even in Misato&#x27;s case the camera did not point at her face in particularly heavy scenes so Mituishi&#x27;s interpretation would not be affected by her lip-reading. As Mitsuishi prepared for the character&#x27;s last scene, she cried so much at the sight of the script she could not continue.

In the English adaptation of the series and &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; she is voiced by Allison Keith, while for the international Netflix release of the series she is dubbed by Carrie Keranen.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;===
At the beginning of the anime, Misato is the Captain of the Tactical Operations Department of the special agency Nerv. Under her command, most of the important decisions in the battles between the Evangelion mechas and the enemies known as Angels are made, and she takes responsibility for the outcomes. Her past is explored in the twelfth and twenty-first episodes of the series. At the age of thirteen, Misato followed her father Dr. Katsuragi on a scientific research expedition to the South Pole. On September 13, 2000, a natural disaster known as Second Impact occurs in Antarctica; all members of the expedition, including Dr. Katsuragi, die in the accident. Misato, the only survivor, is rescued by her parent in an escape pod. Shortly before his death, her father gives her a pendant in the shape of a Greek cross. The event causes Misato an emotional trauma, which causes her to fall into a state of psychogenic aphasia. To prevent an information leak on the Second Impact, she is detained in a research ship for at least two years.

Five years after the catastrophe, Misato heals and enrolls in the university in the city Tokyo-2, where she meets the student Ritsuko Akagi. In the same period, she meets Ryoji Kaji, with whom she forms a romantic relationship that lasts two years. In 2009, after finishing her university studies, Misato joins the German division of a research center called Gehirn and meets Asuka Langley Soryu, a pilot assigned to command the Eva-02. She is later transferred to the Nerv special agency and returns to Japan, where she is promoted to the rank of Captain. In 2015, she picks up Shinji Ikari, a pilot assigned to command the Eva-01, escorting him to the Nerv headquarters in the city Tokyo-3 in the first episode, &quot;Angel Attack&quot;. After a short time, the woman becomes his legal guardian, hosting him in her apartment with her pet penguin Pen-Pen.

During a trip on the United Nations naval fleet, Misato meets Kaji and Asuka again. Shortly after, she takes Asuka in custody, and thanks to her contribution other Angels are destroyed. Meanwhile, Misato encounters Kaji at work and tries to avoid him with a contradictory attitude, but they eventually become closer with time and form a romantic relationship again. After other war operations and the destruction of more enemies, Misato is promoted from Captain to Major. As events progress, however, Misato becomes suspicious of Ryoji, whom she discovers is a spy for the Japanese government. Misato discovers a giant anthropomorphic being, which Kaji identifies as the first Angel, Adam, which is responsible for the Second Impact, is being kept in the Nerv headquarters. Misato, shaken by the discovery, begins to doubt the real intentions of the Nerv and those of her friend Ritsuko Akagi, director of the technical department of the organization. Sometime later, Kaji dies, and Misato begins to persistently search for the truth about Second Impact and a plan known as the Human Instrumentality Project. With the help of her subordinate Makoto Hyuga, she gathers secret information about the intentions of the Human Instrumentality Project.

In the movie &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, the day she discovers the truth a secret organization called Seele orders the requisitioning of the Nerv headquarters, which is stormed by troops of the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Forces. During the attack, Misato tries to get Shinji to safety and persuade him to go to the battlefield but she is mortally wounded and dies before the start of the Human Instrumentality.

===&quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;===
Further differences in the story and characterization of Misato appear in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; film tetralogy. During production, Anno wanted to assign her the role of co-protagonist of the &quot;Rebuild&quot; alongside Shinji, changing her personality. The feature film &quot;&quot; (2007) almost exactly follows the first six episodes of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;; Misato, as in the fourth episode of the classic series &quot;Hedgehog&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, after the battle against the Angel Shamshel, scolds Shinji during a private conversation but when she leaves Shinji she slaps herself. In &quot;Rebuild&quot;, Misato is aware of the presence of the second Angel Lilith in the Nerv headquarters, and reveals its existence to Shinji just before the battle against Ramiel. Before Operation Yashima, Shinji asks Misato why he was chosen as a pilot. Misato, holding his hand, replies that there is no particular reason and that gives him a valid reason to continue piloting and fighting for the salvation of mankind.

In the second installment of the saga, &quot;&quot; (2009), Misato appears less cautious and less reserved than in the original version; during the feature film, she pushes Shinji to get closer to his father Gendo and begins to emotionally talk with Asuka. At the end of the movie, during the battle against the tenth Angel, Misato encourages Shinji to save Rei Ayanami for danger, even though she is aware of the risks.

In &quot;&quot; (2012), set fourteen years after the previous one, Misato plays the role of head of an organization named Wille, which was created to destroy the Nerv, as well as captain of a flying ship called &quot;AAA Wunder&quot;. She maintains a cold attitude towards Shinji to keep him from getting close to his father again and from piloting an Evangelion unit.

In the final feature film of the saga, &quot;&quot; (2021), Misato travels with the crew of &quot;AAA Wunder&quot; to Antarctica, the epicenter of the Second Impact, to attempt to neutralize a unit called Eva-13. Here, Shinji asks Misato to pilot the Eva-01 to stop the antagonist, Commander Ikari; a member of the Wille Sakura Suzuhara tries to shoot Shinji but Misato covers him. Misato reconciles with her subordinate, and remains alone on board &quot;AAA Wunder&quot;, sacrificing herself to stop Gendo&#x27;s plans. In the course of the story, it is also revealed her partner Kaji died to stop the Third Impact and in the interval between &quot;2.0&quot; and &quot;3.0&quot;, she gave birth to their son, also named Kaji, who grows up without knowing his mother by her own will.

===Other media===

In a scene in the last episode of the animated series, a parallel universe with a different backstory than all previous episodes is presented; in the alternative reality, Misato is a teacher of Asuka&#x27;s and Shinji&#x27;s class. Second Impact did not occur so she also does not appear to have undergone a childhood trauma or been to the South Pole. A similar version is presented in some spin-offs of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, such as &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot;, which are set in the alternative reality of the last episode; &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse&quot; and the ONA &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, a parody of the original animated series. In &quot;Petit Eva&quot;, Misato teaches Japanese literature and lives alone rather than being Shinji&#x27;s roommate.

In addition to video games based on the original animated series, Misato is also used in media outside the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; franchise, such as the video games &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;, &quot;Tales of Zestiria&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Keri hime sweets&quot;, &quot;Summons Board&quot;, &quot;Pazudora&quot;, &quot;Puyopuyo!! Quest&quot;, &quot;The Battle Cats&quot;, and in an episode of the anime &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot;.

==Characterization and themes==
===Personality and relationships===
Misato wears several social masks and has a dual personality; one as a lively, superficial young woman and the other as a resolute, stubborn, professional woman. She presents herself with a cheerful, optimistic, exuberant, and frivolous character. In her private life, Misato is sloppy and untidy; her apartment is always chaotic and disorganized, and is full of beer cans and car magazines. At work, however, she shows seriousness, demonstrating emotional coldness. Her affectionate personality sometimes makes her prioritize human feelings over her duty as a Nerv employee, and her job position arouses internal conflict and leads her to make difficult choices. Despite her open, spontaneous character, Misato hides her true feelings; voice actress Mitsuishi described her as an insecure, lonely woman who tries to hide &quot;the loneliness and darkness deep within her heart&quot;. Hideaki Anno wanted to portray Misato as an eternal teenager who, despite childhood traumas and a difficult experience, begins a process of inner analysis through which she builds her own psychologically acceptable reality, in which the fears of the past coexist with everyday life. Moreover, according to Anno himself, Misato&#x27;s psychology would lead mentally infantile people to identify with her.

Misato adopts an older-sister-like attitude toward the male protagonist of the series, Shinji, trying to deal with his problems in a frank and serene way. When Shinji arrives at Nerv&#x27;s headquarters, Misato immediately sees his potential as a pilot, a selfish consideration that later causes her a strong sense of guilt. At the beginning of their relationship she tries to show herself as casual and carefree, in an attempt to convey to him a certain maternal attitude and human warmth. This rough attitude initially irritates Shinji. After the initial embarrassment, however, Shinji understands Misato&#x27;s true motives, as she shows him her helpless, rough side because she trusts him and considers him a member of her family.

Hideaki Anno commented on the characterisation of Misato saying:
According to Kazuya Tsurumaki, assistant director of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, in early episodes Misato and Shinji talk while maintaining a detached, laconic attitude without looking at each other; Misato speaks to Shinji without entering his room &quot;like they [are] looking through a slightly opened door, but not connecting&quot;. Yūichirō Oguro, co-editor of home video editions of the series, noted how in &quot;Evangelion&quot; the characters tend to avoid making eye contact in the early episodes, including Misato and Ritsuko, while in the second episode Shinji and Misato make direct eye contact several times. With time, they become emotionally closer. In the twelfth episode, Misato tells Shinji about the bitter relationship she had with her father and her reasons for joining Nerv, identifying with Shinji and his relationship with his father Gendo. A relationship of mutual esteem grows between Misato and Shinji, and she develops an attachment to him.

Misato&#x27;s relationship with Shinji has been compared to that between a mother and her son; an older sister and a younger brother; an adult and a child; a superior and a subordinate; and between two lovers. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Anne Billson noted that Misato frequently thrusts bosom or bottom at Shinji, but &quot;these glimpses are from Shinji&#x27;s point of view&quot;. Shinji Higuchi, a staff member of the series, described Shinji&#x27;s and Misato&#x27;s relationship as &quot;a temporary relationship that could fade away at any time&quot;. In an interview, Hideaki Anno said he was unsure whether Kaji is the person Misato loves the most; Misato, in his opinion, could not be happy staying with Kaji and &quot;could fall in love with Shinji&quot;. In a scene in the twenty-third episode, Misato enters Shinji&#x27;s bedroom after the death of his classmate Rei Ayanami. Misato tries to touch his hand and comfort him but he shrugs off her touch; according to the filmbooks of the series, she may be about to offer him sex to comfort him and compensate for her loneliness. According to an official pamphlet of &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, Misato is in many ways Shinji&#x27;s &quot;first woman&quot;. In the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, Misato and Shinji say goodbye for the last time; Misato kisses Shinji on the lips and gives him her cross-shaped pendant. Oguro noted in the penultimate episode of the series Misato is laying naked and the reasons for her lively, action-oriented behavior are revealed, while in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; she again becomes the focus of the action but dies in an attempt to save Shinji and with an opposite portrayal to that of the classic series finale. For Oguro, as for Anno, Misato would be accustomed to superficial interpersonal relationships, but according to Oguro in the finale she may have tried for the first time &quot;to get involved with others&quot;.

===Cultural references and psychoanalysis===

Like other characters in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, Misato has a difficult past, a complicated relationship with her separated parents, relationship difficulties, and emotional trauma. Her suffering and torments are rooted in her relationship with her father Dr. Katsuragi, who neglected his wife&#x27;s needs and those of his daughter but sacrificed himself to save Misato&#x27;s life. The disappearance of her father caused her psychic trauma, leading her to become mute for several years and to act in an unhealthy manner towards other men. While trying not to live in her father&#x27;s shadow, Misato finds herself following his life path; once she overcomes her aphasia, Misato enters the Nerv trying to destroy the Angels, which she accuses of having killed her father, to take her personal revenge and dispel what she calls her father&#x27;s &quot;curse&quot;. She also uses sex to feel loved and valued.

Misato&#x27;s attitude has been attributed to an Electra complex, a psychological concept formulated by Carl Gustav Jung; she unconsciously looks for her father in the figure of Kaji to fill the void caused by the disappearance of her parent. After being in a relationship for two years, noticing the unconscious motives behind her attitudes and intimidated by the similarity between the two men, she decides to leave Kaji with an excuse.

In the twenty-fifth episode, Misato issues a long inner monologue, during which her internal conflicts and repressed memories resurface. During her childhood, she tried to be, in her own words, a &quot;good girl&quot; and to help her mother, who was also neglected by her father, but once she became an adult she felt disgusted at her servile behavior. This led her to want to &quot;get dirty&quot; through her close sexual relationship with Kaji, the only person to whom she seems to genuinely show herself. Although she rejects Human Instrumentality, through which the souls of all human beings would unite into one complete being, she yearns for &quot;peace&quot;, seeking refuge in the figure of Kaji.

In the third episode of the series, Misato discusses Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s hedgehog&#x27;s dilemma with her friend Ritsuko Akagi, highlighting her views on human relationships and communication, according to which growing up is a constant attempt to get closer and further away from each other. She and Shinji hurt each other like Schopenhauer&#x27;s hedgehogs but continue to need each other to avoid suffocating in loneliness. Both characters are gripped by torments, fears and social difficulties. Misato, herself a victim of the dilemma, is unable to openly express her feelings and during the fourth episode she rejects Shinji. In the final sequence of the episode, however, the two characters seem to become closer without hurting each other, overcoming Schopenhauer&#x27;s dilemma.

Anthony Gramuglia of Anime Feminist, analyzing Misato&#x27;s characterization and lifestyle, made a parallelism with the Japanese lost generation and millennials or Generation Y, who after the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble had difficulty finding housing and tend to be underpaid for the amount of work they do. Italian researcher Fabio Bartoli noted a dichotomy between the characters of Misato and Ritsuko, associating Misato to the Nietzschean Dionysian spirit, to the sephirah Cochkmah and to the father—her parental figure of reference—and Ritsuko to the Apollonian spirit, to Binah and the mother, to whom she seems to be more attached. According to the book &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Unofficial Guide&quot;, Misato&#x27;s name contains the Japanese word , which can be translated as &quot;mass&quot;, a possible reference to her dark clothing and the cross-shaped pendant she wears around her neck.

Critics have associated character traits of Shinji and Misato with borderline personality disorder; Misato is impulsive, sexually promiscuous, and is frightened of being abandoned, much like a person with the mood disorder. Misato is also the focus of some epistemological reflections already present in earlier Gainax works. In the seventh and twelfth episodes, Misato is optimistic about the potential of humans, emphasizing the limits of science and probabilistic predictions. Her philosophical position is summarized in one of her mottoes; &quot;The value of a miracle becomes real only after the miracle has been performed&quot; which, in addition to rejecting a fatalistic and resigned attitude, refers to her personal experience, having been miraculously saved by her father at the South Pole. Equivalent expressions can be found in the sixth episode of &quot;Gunbuster&quot; and in the twenty-first episode of &quot;&quot;, both of which Anno directed. For writer Dennis Redmond, Misato is based on Nadia Arwol from &quot;Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water&quot; while Akio Nagatomi of The Animé Café compared her to Kazumi Amano from &quot;Gunbuster&quot;. The theme of conflict with paternal figures is also present in Anno&#x27;s previous works.

==Cultural impact==
===Popularity===
The character of Misato has been ranked in several popularity polls, in different categories, placing among the most popular &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; characters. After the conclusion of the series, Misato ranked eighth among the most-popular female characters of the moment in the 1996 Anime Grand Prix, a large annual survey conducted by the Japanese magazine &quot;Animage&quot;. In the next two Anime Grand Prix, she stayed in the top twenty; in 1997 she remained in eighth place, while in 1998 she dropped to thirteenth. Misato also remained in the magazine&#x27;s monthly rankings throughout 1997, consistently placing among the thirty most-popular characters. In 1998, the magazine placed her twenty-seventh among the most-popular anime characters. Moreover, according to &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine, Misato&#x27;s popularity led her to become the most-popular female character in the series in the United States, surpassing Rei Ayanami and Asuka.

===Critical reception===

Critics have been generally positive about Misato&#x27;s character. Anime reviewers praised the characterisation and psychology of the character. According to writer Kazuhisa Fujie, she is &quot;the most elaborately described character in &quot;Evangelion&quot;&quot;. Japanese website Niconico ranked her first among animated characters that are most suited to the role of big sister, appreciating both her messy, affectionate, homely attitude and her military skills. Crunchyroll&#x27;s Kara Dennison called her an extremely &quot;under-appreciated&quot; character. The website Urban Cinefile described her as a &quot;daring, decisive, innovative&quot; character. The websites Screen Rant and Comic Book Resources ranked Misato among the best characters in the series. According to Ritwik Mitra of Screen Rant; &quot;One of the important women in Shinji&#x27;s life and a great character in her own right, Misato is ... one of the more intriguing characters in the entire show, and a treat to watch during some of the more impactful moments in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;&quot;.

Other reviewers expressed criticism for her characterization. Anime News Network reviewer Kenneth Lee found her characterization ineffective, writing about the lack of convincing explanations about Misato&#x27;s emergence from her years of aphasia. Comic Book Resources&#x27;s Theo Kogod criticized her decision to take Asuka and Shinji into custody. Further criticism was aimed at some scenes in the twentieth episode, in which Misato has sexual intercourse with Kaji, and some of her sexually implied approaches to fourteen-year-old Shinji. Emily Auten of Nerdmuch.com and Brittany Vincenti of Geek.com, on the other hand, expressed positive opinions of her relationship with Kaji. Comic Book Resources&#x27; Ajay Aravind noted the kiss between Shinji and Misato as one of the scenes that changed Japanese animation; his colleague Devin Meenan described it as &quot;one of the most beautiful&quot; of &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;. For 25 Years Later&#x27;s Alex Boruff, the relationship between Shinji and Misato is &quot;Evangelion&quot; most important, and it &quot;doesn’t fit into any conventional archetypes of relationships&quot;; according to Boruff, &quot;part of what makes their dynamic so fascinating is the ambiguity of it&quot;.

Misato&#x27;s role in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga also drew criticism and praise from reviewers. For Comic Book Resources&#x27;s Angelos Delos Trinos, her characterization in &quot;Rebuild&quot; is minimal when compared &quot;to her depth and nuance&quot; in the classic series. &quot;Anime Reign&quot; magazine also expressed a negative opinion, deeming her role underexplored and shadowy. The website &quot;Japanator&quot; expresses a contrary opinion, saying it is &quot;fascinating to see Misato unchained from the shackles of Nerv&quot;, emphasizing the consistency of the changes and finding them relevant to the spirit of &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;. The reception of Misato&#x27;s role in the last installment of the saga &quot;&quot; (2021) was more positive. For &quot;IGN&quot; Hanrique Padula, Misato and the show&#x27;s other characters would, in the film, gain facets never seen before, reaching points never reached in the original series. Comic Book Resources&#x27; Reuben Baron also welcomed the revelations presented in the feature film, saying; &quot;&quot;3.0+1.01&quot; also fills in enough details about Misato&#x27;s experiences during the time skip [in &quot;3.0&quot;] to give her a more convincing emotional arc&quot;.

===Legacy and merchandise===
Misato&#x27;s character has been used for merchandising items, such as toys, collectible models, action figures, alcohol, eyewear, gun holsters and clothing items. In June 2009, Bandai Namco Entertainment and Cellius released a program called &quot;The Misato Katsuragi News Project&quot;, in which the character Misato announced the most important news of the day via a voice simulator. The program remained active until June of the following year. Misato was also used in advertising campaigns for the Japan Racing Association and features on the 500 Type Eva, a high-speed train dedicated to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

Misato is parodied in the manga &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot;, which has a reference to the photograph she gives Shinji in the first episode of the series. Actress Natsuki Kato has paid homage to Misato by cosplaying her; in 2015, she dressed as Misato during an official announcement by the Hakuto team of a space mission to send a miniature replica of Longinus&#x27; spear to the Moon. Hiroyasu Ishida, director of &quot;Penguin Highway&quot;, cited Misato as one of the influences for Aoyama&#x27;s older sister, the feature film&#x27;s protagonist. According to Kazuya Tsurumaki, Sadamoto may have initially thought of Misato for the conception of &quot;FLCL&quot; Haruko Haruhara. &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; author Hajime Isayama drew Mikasa Ackerman&#x27;s name from the warship of the same name, thinking of Misato&#x27;s surname or those of Ritsuko or Yuki Nagato from &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;, all of which came from warships, with the idea similar names would bring success to the characters.

Critics have found similarities to Misato in later female anime characters, including Talho Yūki from &quot;Eureka Seven&quot; by her way of drinking beer and Haruka Shitow from &quot;RahXephon&quot; for her maternal attitude toward the series&#x27; protagonist, Kamina. Anime News Network&#x27; Gabriella Ekens compared Misato to Chain Sumeragi from &quot;Blood Blockade Battlefront&quot;, as both sensual, career women with comic moments; she also noticed that Kazuki Kuwanomi from &quot;Plastic Memories&quot; is &quot;often framed in ways that resemble Misato&quot;. Her colleague Jason Green similarly traced Misato&#x27;s influence on the characterization of Yoko Littner from &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;, particularly in the use of &quot;Gainax bounce&quot; fan service.

<text>Monsignor Quixote is a novel by Graham Greene, published in 1982. The book is a pastiche of the early 1600s novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes with many moments of comedy, but also offers reflection on matters such as life after a dictatorship, Communism, and the Catholic faith.

==Plot summary==
Father Quixote, a parish priest in the little town of El Toboso in Spain&#x27;s La Mancha region, regards himself as a descendant of Cervantes&#x27; character of the same name, even if people point out to him that Don Quixote was a fictitious character. One day, he helps and gives food to a mysterious Italian bishop whose car has broken down. Shortly afterwards, he is given the title of &quot;Monsignor&quot; by the Pope, much to the surprise of his bishop who looks upon Father Quixote&#x27;s activities rather with suspicion. He urges the priest to take a holiday, and so Quixote embarks upon a voyage through Spain with his old Seat 600 called &quot;Rocinante&quot; and in the company of the Communist ex-mayor of El Toboso (who, of course, is nicknamed &quot;Sancho&quot;). In the subsequent course of events, Quixote and his companion have all sorts of funny and moving adventures along the lines of his ancestor&#x27;s on their way through post-Franco Spain. They encounter the contemporary equivalents of the windmills, are confronted with holy and not-so-holy places and with sinners of all sorts. In their dialogues about Catholicism and Communism, the two men are brought closer, start to appreciate each other better but also to question their own beliefs.

Quixote is briefly taken back to El Toboso, confronted by the bishop about his doings and suspended from service as a priest, but he escapes and sets out again with Sancho. In his last adventure, Father Quixote is struck down and wounded while attempting to save a statue of the Virgin Mary from hypocrites who are desecrating her by offering her up for money. This is the scene from the original Cervantes&#x27; novel refurbished with reversed accents: Quixote &quot;does&quot; know Who the Lady is, while the people in the procession actually &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;. Quixote and Sancho are brought to a Trappist monastery where, sleepwalking and in delirium, Father Quixote rises from his bed at night, goes to the church, celebrates the old Tridentine Mass—all the time imagining he holds bread and wine in his hands—and then, in a last effort, administers communion to the Communist ex-mayor before sinking dead into his friend&#x27;s arms.

==Television adaptations==
In 1985, Greene and Christopher Neame adapted the novel into a television film starring Alec Guinness and Leo McKern, as well as featuring several other notable actors including Ian Richardson and Graham Crowden. Richardson and Crowden have also appeared in other versions of the Quixote story – Richardson in the 1972 film &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, and Crowden in the 2000 made-for-TV version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, starring John Lithgow.

==Radio adaptations==
In 2016, Stephen Wyatt adapted the novel for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot;. The ten-episode adaptation, directed by Marc Beeby, starred Bernard Cribbins as Quixote and Philip Jackson as Sancho. There is also an unabridged audio version of the book read by Cyril Cusack.

* bandwidth management via multiple connection thread pools
* WebSocket and IPv6 support

==History==
NaviServer is based on AOLserver (version 4.10), AOL&#x27;s open-source web server. The NaviServer project started as a fork of the AOLserver project in July 2005. It is different by supporting multiple protocols, providing higher scalability through asynchronous I/O and aims to be less conservative with new feature development.

Historically &quot;NaviServer&quot; was the original name of the server, a closed-source product by a company called NaviSoft in the early 1990s. It was bought by AOL in 1995, and released as open-source in 1999 as AOLserver after they released Mozilla. This friendly-fork takes the code back to its original name.

Large applications of NaviServer are the ArsDigita Community System and OpenACS in particular.

<text>New Kyo is a village in County Durham, in England. It is situated close to the A693 road between Annfield Plain and Stanley, and is slightly larger than nearby East Kyo to the north east and West Kyo, 15 minutes walk via public footpath to the north at the other side of the C2C cycle path. Oxhill is situated to the east on the way to &quot;Stanley&quot;.

Annfield Intermediate School was situated to the east end of &quot;New Kyo&quot; until the late 1990s, this being &quot;Greencroft Comprehensive Lower School&quot; from 1965 onwards (the first and second years were accommodated here before being transferred to &quot;Greencroft Comprehensive Upper School&quot; for the third year onwards to school leaving age) up to the late 1990s. After this, the lower and upper schools were merged and pupils were moved to &quot;Greencroft&quot;, now named just &quot;Greencroft School&quot;.

The current main landmark is the &quot;Monkey&quot; working men&#x27;s club, hidden behind the fish and chip shop, at the far western end of &quot;New Kyo&quot;. This is on the boundary with &quot;Annfield Plain&quot;.

Kyo Pond is situated next to the &quot;C2C&quot; cycle path, almost halfway to &quot;West Kyo&quot;. It continues to exist despite a number of attempts to fill it in. Local landmark, &quot;The Bogs&quot;, exists beyond the &quot;C2C&quot;.</text><links>

<doc id="1146842" wikidata="Q4904262" url="?curid=1146842" title="Bidston Dock">
<text>Bidston Dock was a dock at Birkenhead, in England. It was situated to the west of the Great Float, between Bidston and Poulton.

==History==

A proposal for the construction of the dock on most of what remained of the tidal inlet of Wallasey Pool was outlined in the 1920s. Consisting of the main basin and four additional branches, only part of the main dock was eventually built.

Bidston dock was opened in March 1933 and originally known as the West Float extension. The dock was first used for laying up ships, such as the Ellerman Lines&#x27; &quot;City of London&quot; and &quot;City of York&quot;. 
In 1947 the Greek liner &quot;Matrona&quot; capsized at her moorings 
when her ballast was removed during conversion work. Having been refloated in June 1948 by seven locomotives operating on specially built tracks, she was towed to Barrow-In-Furness for scrapping. 
In 1952 the Bibby Line vessel &quot;Somersetshire&quot; boarded crew at Bidston Dock prior to service as an emigrant ship to Australia.

The dock was significantly altered in the 1950s to allow the transportation of iron ore bound for Shotton. The dock had a trio of large moveable cranes to unload the iron ore, which were dismantled in the late 1990s. The northern quayside of Bidston Dock was the iron ore berth, which was operated by Rea Ltd. The southern quayside was unallocated.
By 1992, the dock was only being used for laying up ships, such as the Isle of Man Steam Packet vessels. Some of the final traffic through the dock involved the transportation of timber. Bidston Dock was subsequently closed and was landfilled by 2003.

The dock was served by the Birkenhead Dock Branch railway line and an iron ore train ran regularly to the John Summers Steelworks in Shotton. Monthly shipments of iron ore arrived at Bidston Dock from 1956. Due to the nature of the train, a high degree of motive power was required. Class 40s and pairs of Class 25 locomotives are known to have operated on this track, during its latter days. In the steam era, the iron ore train was known to have been hauled by Class 9F locomotives. The Class 9F locomotive 92203, later named as &quot;Black Prince&quot;, worked the final steam-hauled iron ore train in November 1967.
Though the dock itself was filled, the northern quayside, on which the cranes were situated, and the railway sidings are still intact, although disused.

==Future==
Peel Holdings have expressed an interest to develop the site of the former dock, as part of the Wirral Waters regeneration project. This part of the project would encompass of leisure facilities and a retail park.

As of 2022, a new £13 million park is being constructed which will link Rock Ferry with Bidston Dock. Known as Dock Branch Park, it will provide a mile–long pedestrian and cycle corridor between the two locations, as well as providing land for 1,000 homes a new venue for Wirral Transport Museum.

<text>A reaction ferry is a cable ferry that uses the reaction of the current of a river against a fixed tether to propel the vessel across the water. Such ferries operate faster and more effectively in rivers with strong currents.

==Types and modes of operation==
Some reaction ferries operate using an overhead cable suspended from towers anchored on either bank of the river at right angles to the current flow. A &quot;traveller&quot; with pulleys runs along this cable and is attached to the ferry with a tether rope. This can divide into a two-part bridle which defines the angle of the ferry to the current. Sometimes two pulleys and tethers are used. Sometimes a single tether is attached to a bar that can be swung from one side of the ferry to the other. This type also uses a rudder in order to set the angle of the ferry to the current flow from zero - it is then stationary - to the best angle for maximal crossing speed. Ferries without a rudder change the relative lengths of the bridle or multiple tethers in order to steer. The lateral force of the current moves the ferry across the river.

A now rare type of reaction ferry uses a submerged cable lying on the bottom across a river or tidal water. This can be a wire rope or a chain and is pulled to the surface by the ferry or its operator. It passes through moveable pulleys or belaying points whose location sets the ferry&#x27;s angle. In order to set off, manual work is required to initially pull the cable and also to manoeuvre, especially during the turning of the tide.

The ferry may consist of a single hull, or two pontoons with a deck bridging them. Some ferries carry only passengers, whilst others carry road vehicles, with some examples carrying up to 12 cars.

==Physical explanation==

A reaction ferry operates as a sailing craft where the traveller pulleys represent the wheels of a land yacht and the moving fluid is the water current rather than the wind. In the case of a reaction ferry with an anchored tether, the analogy can also be to a kite. In both cases the ferry&#x27;s hull itself represents a sail and is angled to the apparent water current in order to generate lift in the same way a sail is set at an angle to the apparent wind.

With an overhead cable stretched across a river at right angles to the current, the ferry is, in sailing terminology, sailing on a reach with the true current exactly at right angles to the direction of crossing. For the anchored-tether type ferry this is valid when the tether is parallel to the current, near the middle of crossing. In sailing, the speed is governed by the lift-to-drag ratios (L/D) of the sail and the hull including centerboard or keel and rudder.

For reaction ferries, L/D ratios also apply except that one is very high, for example typically 30 for a traveller on a steel rope, as visible in aerial photographs, and the other can vary from low, e.g. 1-2 without a centerboard, to 3.5 with one.

A diagram is shown which follows the standard force diagram for sailing. It is drawn with a traveller L/D of only about 6 in order to make it clearer. The ferry L/D is drawn at 1.5. The lift L acts at right angles to the direction of the apparent current, the vector sum of the true current and the current component due to the crossing speed. The drag D acts parallel to the apparent current. The vector sum of L and D is the resultant force R. This force can only exist because the tether exerts an opposed force of the same magnitude (see Newton&#x27;s laws of motion), in this simplified two-dimensional projection of what is really a three-dimensional situation. R can be resolved in a drag component directly downstream and a component in the direction of crossing, the thrust T which drives the ferry. This is balanced by the opposing drag of the traveller pulleys. The amount of lift required is set by the angle of incidence of the ferry to the apparent current (here 10°), often done with a rudder (not shown).

In the figure the crossing speed is the same as the speed of the true current. With a centerboard or keel, the hull&#x27;s L/D could increase several times. This would increase the crossing speed also several times, but according to the drag equation the forces increase with the square of the speed and put a great load particularly on the overhead cable. With the anchored-tether type ferry, such high speeds would be unobtainable because its tether drags in the water or is supported by buoys that do and this drag would also increase with the square of the speed.

<text>The mayor of Dunedin is the head of the local government, the city council of Dunedin, New Zealand. The mayor&#x27;s role is &quot;to provide leadership to the other elected members of the territorial authority, be a leader in the community and perform civic duties&quot;. The mayor is directly elected, using the single transferable vote (STV) system from 2007. The current mayor is Jules Radich who was elected in 2022.

The mayor has always been elected at large, with the inaugural election in 1865. Up until 1915, the term of mayor was for one year only. From 1915 to 1935, the term was two years. Since the 1935 mayoral election, the term has been three years. The role of deputy mayor was established in 1917.
The city council translates the office and title of mayor as Te Koromatua o Ōtepoti.

<doc id="1146869" wikidata="Q796857" url="?curid=1146869" title="BOLT-117">
<text>The Texas Instruments BOLT-117 (BOmb, Laser Terminal-117), retrospectively redesignated as the GBU-1/B (Guided Bomb Unit) was the world&#x27;s first laser-guided bomb (LGB). It consisted of a standard M117 bomb case with a KMU-342 laser guidance and control kit. This consisted of a gimballed laser seeker on the front of the bomb and tail and control fins to guide the bomb to the target. The latter used the bang-bang method of control where each control surface was either straight or fully deflected. This was inefficient aerodynamically, but reduced costs and minimized demands on the primitive onboard electronics.

Originally the project began as a surface-to-air missile seeker developed by Texas Instruments (TI). When TI executive Glenn E. Penisten attempted to sell the new technology to the United States Air Force (USAF), Colonel Joe Davis Jr. inquired if it could instead be used as a ground attack system to overcome problems US aircraft were having with the poor accuracy of bombing in Vietnam. Davis had already witnessed a test of the United States Army&#x27;s new laser target designator made by Martin Marietta, but no seeker existed to make use of the system. Davis had already performed tests from the back seat of an F-4 Phantom II fighter bomber and proved that it was possible to accurately target objects from a moving aircraft. His mock testing proved correct, and during further testing with live seekers, it took just six attempts to improve the seeker accuracy from to within of the target. This greatly exceeded the design requirements. It was commissioned by the USAF in 1967. 

The BOLT-117 and Paveway I (based on the more streamlined Mk 84 2,000-pound bomb) underwent combat evaluation with the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing in Southeast Asia from May to August 1968. The first combat drop of a laser guided bomb was made using BOLT-117s on 23 May 1968. Without the existence of tracking pods, the Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) in the back seat of an F-4 Phantom II used a hand-held &quot;Airborne Laser Designator&quot; to guide the bombs, but half of the LGBs still hit their targets despite the difficulties inherent in keeping the laser on the target. Placement of the control surfaces on the rear of the bomb proved to be less than ideal as it limited the ability of the fins to control the bomb&#x27;s trajectory. In the combat evaluations the BOLT-117 achieved a circular error probability (CEP) of while the Paveway I achieved a CEP of with one in every four bombs scoring a direct hit. Only a limited number of BOLT-117 bombs were produced before it was discontinued in favor of the more accurate Paveway I family of guidance kits that moved the control fins to the front of the bomb. The Paveway variant was very successful and over 28,000 Paveway weapons were dropped during the war in Vietnam.

The impact of the BOLT-117 on aerial warfare was revolutionary, allowing the destruction of targets even other existing precision weapons had difficulty destroying due to having small warheads and difficulty tracking certain types of objects. Earlier electro-optical weapons such as the AGM-62 Walleye could accurately strike targets with small outlines and good contrast on camera but had difficulty hitting large oddly shaped structures like bridges. Laser-guided weapons allowed far greater precision against these types of targets, and with much larger warheads.

Another equally important improvement was the ability to use add-on guidance kits to turn standard &quot;dumb&quot; ordnance into precision-guided munition yielding a considerable increase in effectiveness compared with free-falling, unguided bombs, and doing so at a fraction of the cost of other guided weapons. The cost of the add-on kits was only a few percent of the original $100,000 price goal.

== Design ==
The BOLT-117 featured a KMU-342 laser guidance and control kit attached to M117 750-pound bomb. The guidance system and control fins were adapted from the AGM-45 Shrike missile. The BOLT-117 was discontinued in favor of the more powerful GBU-10 Paveway.

<text>Scollay Square (c. 1838–1962) was a city square in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. It was named for William Scollay, a prominent local developer and militia officer who bought a landmark four-story merchant building at the intersection of the Cambridge and Court Streets in the year 1795. Local citizens began to refer to this intersection as Scollay&#x27;s Square, and, in 1838, the city officially memorialized the intersection as the Scollay Square. Early on, the area was a busy center of commerce, including daguerreotypist (photographer) Josiah Johnson Hawes (1808–1901) and Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, the first dentist to use ether as an anaesthetic.

As early as the 1950s city officials had been mulling plans to completely tear the Square down and redevelop the area. Eventually more than 1,000 buildings were demolished and 20,000 residents were displaced. With $40 million in federal funds, the city built an entirely new development there, Government Center.

== History ==
Scollay Square was located &quot;at the junction of Tremont and Court streets, Cornhill and Tremont Row&quot;. Initially the city designated it Pemberton Square, but changed the name to &quot;Scollay Square&quot; when Phillips Square changed its own name to &quot;Pemberton Square&quot;. The building that gave the area its name, Scollay&#x27;s Building, was the last remnant of a once-larger group of buildings: &quot;at one time a wedge-shaped row of wooden buildings, extending from the head of Cornhill to opposite the head of Hanover street, separated Tremont row from Court street (see Bonner&#x27;s map, 1722); at the southeasterly end the second schoolhouse in the town was erected, 1683-84; at various times portions of these buildings were removed, leaving only the Scollay brick building, supposed to have been built by Patrick Jeffrey, who came into possession in 1795; named for William Scollay, an apothecary... removed about 1870.&quot;

=== Culture ===
; Old Howard Theatre
Among the most famous (and infamous) of Scollay Square landmarks was the Old Howard Theatre, a grand theater which began life as the headquarters of a Millerite Adventist Christian sect which believed the world would end in October 1844. After the world failed to end on schedule, the building was sold in 1844 and reopened as a vaudeville and Shakespearean venue. Later, in the 1900s and 1910s, it would showcase the popular minstrel shows.

By around the 1940s the Scollay Square area began to lose its vibrant commercial activity, and the Howard gradually changed its image and began to cater to sailors on leave and college students by including burlesque shows, as did other nearby venues such as the Casino Theater and Crawford House. &quot;Always Something Doing&quot; became the Old Howard&#x27;s advertising slogan. The venue also showcased boxing matches with boxers including Rocky Marciano, and continued to feature slapstick vaudeville acts, from likes of The Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello.

But it was the success and prominence of the burlesque shows that brought the Old Howard down. In 1953, vice squad agents snuck a home movie camera into the Old Howard, and caught Mary Goodneighbor on film doing her striptease for the audience. The film led to the closure of the theater, and it remained closed until it caught fire mysteriously in 1961.

The square was also the home of Austin and Stone&#x27;s Dime Museum.

; John Winthrop Statue
To mark the 250th anniversary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the sculptor Richard Saltonstall Greenough was commissioned to create a bronze sculpture of John Winthrop, the first Governor of the state. The statue was installed in September 1880.

===Abolitionism===
Scollay Square was also a flashpoint for the early abolition movement. Author William Lloyd Garrison was twice attacked by an angry mob for printing his anti-slavery newspaper &quot;The Liberator&quot;, which began publication in 1831. Sarah Parker Remond&#x27;s first act of civil disobedience occurred in 1853 at the Old Howard when she was refused the seat she had purchased but was instead seated in the &#x27;black&#x27; section. Many of the buildings in the area in and around Scollay Square had hidden spaces where escaped slaves were hidden, as part of the Underground Railroad.

===Destruction and redevelopment===

By the end of World War II, Scollay Square had deteriorated into a shanty town and a red-light district. The Old Howard had become an increasingly tawdry burlesque establishment.

As early as the 1950s, city officials had been mulling plans to completely tear down and redevelop the Scollay Square area, in order to remove lower-income residents and troubled businesses from the aging and seedy district. Attempts to reopen the sullied Old Howard by its old performers had been one of the last efforts against redevelopment; but with the theater gutted by fire, a city wrecking ball began the project of demolishing more than 1,000 buildings in the area; 20,000 residents were displaced.

The city offered to give any demolished materials to anyone who could load and take away a full dump truck load. The materials included street paving blocks (Belgian blocks quarried in Quincy), granite, lintels, and bricks.

With $40 million in federal funds, the city built an entirely new development on top of old Scollay Square, renaming the area Government Center, and peppering it with city, state, and federal government buildings: Boston City Hall, City Hall Plaza, Government Service Center, and the Edward W. Brooke Courthouse.

==References in popular culture==
* Pearl Schiff&#x27;s best-selling 1952 novel, &quot;Scollay Square&quot;, tells the story of a young woman&#x27;s affair with a sailor she met in a Scollay Square tavern. The book was considered scandalous at the time.
* Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1957 novel, &quot;On the Road&quot;, tells the story of protagonist Sal Paradise&#x27;s booze-fueled night at a Scollay Square tavern.
* In The Kingston Trio song &quot;M.T.A.&quot;, Charlie&#x27;s wife regularly goes to the Scollay Square station to hand her stranded husband a sandwich. The scene is mirrored in the Dropkick Murphys song &quot;Skinhead on the MBTA&quot;.
* Sam Savage&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;&quot;, a magical-realist account of a literate rat, takes place in Scollay Square at the time of its destruction.
* In the game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, one of the towns the player can visit is modeled after Scollay Square, named Goodneighbor after Mary Goodneighbor, who was filmed by local authorities in 1953 doing a striptease at the Old Howard Theatre. Since &quot;Fallout&quot; is set in an alternate timeline, it can be assumed that Scollay Square was not altered during the 1960s.
* In &quot;The Huntress&quot;, a novel by Kate Quinn, several chapters are set in a family home just off of Scollay Square.
* In the tv show “Have Gun - Will Travel” in the 1958 Season 1 Episode 21 episode titled &quot;The Bostonian&quot; The lead character, Paladin remarks to Henry (a man from Boston that he just met): “in my time Henry, I was the best dressed bouncer in Scollay Square”.  The two of them then reminisce about their time in Boston, especially in the Scollay Square and Back Bay areas and reference several bars and establishments in Scollay Square that both had frequented.

<text>Geoffrey Clark Davis (born October 26, 1958) is an American businessman, politician and former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2005 to 2012. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes 24 counties in the northeastern part of the state, stretching from the fringes of the Louisville area to the West Virginia border. Most of its vote, however, is cast in the counties bordering Cincinnati. On December 15, 2011, Davis announced he would not seek reelection in 2012. On July 31, 2012, he announced his resignation from Congress effective immediately.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Davis was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to American parents. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and later received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. At West Point, Davis studied national security and international affairs, as well as the Arabic language. In the U.S. Army he served as an aviation officer, eventually becoming an Assault Helicopter Flight Commander in the 82nd Airborne Division. Davis also ran U.S. Army aviation operations for peace enforcement between Israel and Egypt. During his U.S. Army career, he attained both Senior Parachutist and Ranger qualification.

Before running for the U.S. House of Representatives, he owned a consulting firm specializing in lean manufacturing and systems integration.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

====2002====
In the 2002 elections, Davis challenged Ken Lucas, the Democratic incumbent but was narrowly defeated 51%–48%.

====2004====
Lucas declined to run for re-election, honoring a promise to serve only three terms. In the 2004 race for the open seat, Davis defeated his Democratic opponent Nick Clooney, father of actor George Clooney, 54%–44%.

====2006====

On January 30, 2006, Lucas announced he would challenge Davis later that year. The announcement instantly turned the race into one of the hottest in the campaign cycle, even though the 4th is considered one of the most Republican districts in Kentucky. Despite a substantial Democratic advantage in voter registration, the influence of the heavily Republican northern Kentucky suburbs kept the district in Republican hands from 1967 until Lucas won the seat in 1998. In August Congressional Quarterly rated this race as &quot;Lean Republican.&quot; In late July the Washington Post also rated the race as a toss-up. A SurveyUSA poll released on July 25, 2006, showed Lucas leading 50% to 41%. However, Davis regained the lead in a SurveyUSA poll later in the cycle (46% Davis – 44% Lucas). Davis also had a decisive lead in fundraising. The Cook Political Report, an independent non-partisan newsletter, rated the race for Kentucky&#x27;s 4th Congressional District as a &quot;Republican Toss-Up&quot;, meaning either party has a good chance of winning.

Davis won re-election 52%–43%, a margin of 17,023 votes. To date, this is the last time a Democrat has managed as much as 40 percent of the district&#x27;s vote.

====2008====
Davis won re-election with 63% of the vote, defeating Michael Kelley.

====2010====

Davis was challenged by Democrat John Waltz, whom he defeated with 69% of the votes cast.

===Tenure===
Davis has a solidly conservative voting record; according to his congressional website, he has positioned himself as pro-life and in favor of industrial deregulation.

In November 2005, Davis made headlines for his response to Pennsylvania representative John Murtha&#x27;s call for withdrawal from Iraq, saying, &quot;Ayman Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden&#x27;s deputy, as well as Abu Musab Zarqawi, have made it quite clear in their internal propaganda that they cannot win unless they can drive the Americans out. And they know that they can&#x27;t do that there, so they&#x27;ve brought the battlefield to the halls of Congress. And, frankly, the liberal leadership have put politics ahead of sound, fiscal and national security policy. And what they have done is cooperated with our enemies and are emboldening our enemies.&quot; Davis faced harsh criticism for his remarks, including, for example, from the Democratic Veterans of Northern Kentucky, and sparked a drive led by national Democratic Party leaders to get Ken Lucas to run against him in 2006.

Davis is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act while the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve defined &quot;unlawful Internet gambling&quot;).

In October 2009, Davis filed the REINS (Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny) Act which would give Congress an up or down vote on major rules. A re-introduced version of the bill passed the House on December 7, 2011, but was not taken up by the Senate.

In 2011, Davis voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.

====Contributors====
The Davis campaign has received contributions from the Americans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (ARMPAC), which was led by former Texas Congressman Tom DeLay. As of June 30, 2006, according to the Federal Election Commission, of the $2.4 million contributed to the Davis campaign for the current 2006 electoral cycle, $10,000 was contributed by ARMPAC. Tom DeLay is the subject of indictments sought by Ronnie Earle, the district attorney for Travis County, Texas, alleging violations of Texas campaign-finance law. Judge Pat Priest has dismissed one indictment against DeLay, the second has not yet come to trial. The charges against DeLay are considered by some to be politically motivated. Democrats have indicated that they consider the ARMPAC contributions to be a campaign issue. Davis was never accused of any misconduct.

Davis has received donations from Republican Duke Cunningham, who pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. Davis has not chosen to give back the money from Cunningham, while many other recipients have. Davis received a donation from Congressman Bob Ney, who pleaded guilty for bribery and his involvement with convicted felon Jack Abramoff.

====Controversies====
On April 12, 2008, at a Northern Kentucky Lincoln Day dinner, Davis compared the campaign slogans of Barack Obama to the sales pitch of a &quot;snake oil salesman&quot;. He said in his remarks at the GOP dinner that he participated in a &quot;highly classified, national security simulation&quot; with Obama.

&quot;I&#x27;m going to tell you something: That boy&#x27;s finger does not need to be on the button,&quot; Davis added. &quot;He could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country.&quot;

Davis also made reference to Obama as being put into the Senate by someone who will probably spend many years of his life in prison (presumably a reference to Tony Rezko) and that Obama had never had a real job before.

Davis later apologized for his comment in a letter:

====Resignation====
On July 31, 2012, Geoff Davis resigned from Congress due to family health issues, effective immediately. Governor Steve Beshear called for a special election to fill the seat to occur the same day as the general election in November, which would allow the winner to be sworn in immediately.

<text>Office Killer is a 1997 American comedy-horror film directed by Cindy Sherman. It was released in the fall of 1997 and stars Carol Kane, Molly Ringwald and David Thornton.

== Plot ==
A magazine editor named Dorine, due to budget cuts, is forced to work from home. One night she is called to help fix the computer of a co-worker, Gary Michaels, who is electrocuted while trying to fix the wires. Dorine dials 911, but hangs up when the call is answered. She places the corpse on a cart, rolls it down to her car, loads it in her trunk, and takes it home, placing it in her basement. Then, seemingly without reason, she goes into a murder spree.

She begins her spree by murdering another office worker, but later murders two young Girl Scouts who arrive at her door to sell cookies. The young girls join the other corpses in the basement, and Dorine is seen eating the cookies while working on her new laptop.

Dorine sends messages from Gary to the remaining office workers, implying he is alive. There are three more murders before the movie ends, all artistically executed. The last murder is the office manager (played by a young Jeanne Tripplehorn), who awakens in the basement, surrounded by dismembered bodies, after being knocked out by Dorine on a lunch date. After dispatching the office manager&#x27;s boyfriend (a young Michael Imperioli) who had come searching for her with a kitchen knife, Dorine murders the office manager after taunting her for making her and other employees work from home.

The last scene shows Dorine, after her mother&#x27;s death, setting fire to her basement, then, sporting a blond wig and makeup and with the office manager&#x27;s head in a bag on the seat beside her, driving away in her car, and circling a newspaper ad for an office job.

==Cast==
* Carol Kane as Dorine Douglas
* Molly Ringwald as Kim Poole
* Jeanne Tripplehorn as Norah Reed
* Barbara Sukowa as Virginia Wingate
* Michael Imperioli as Daniel Birch
* David Thornton as Gary Michaels
* Alice Drummond as Carlotta Douglas
* Michelle Hurst as Kate
* Julia McIlvaine as Linda

==Production==
&quot;Office Killer&quot; was one in a planned series of low-budget horror movies by veteran indie producer Christine Vachon, with these films being intended to have budgets of around $300,000.

==Reception==
The film received a mixed response from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 17% rating, based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 3.1/10. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed in December 1997 that the film included &quot;a nasty caricature of Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington&quot;. He added that the film was &quot;sadly inept&quot; and that &quot;the actors try gamely to rise above their cardboard roles.&quot; Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s tone in his 1997 review. He wrote, &quot;in its early stages, the film aims for a kind of modern-baroque spoofery, with Dorine nagged at home by her crippled mom, the women in the office all at each other’s throats and Dorine herself toddling through the picture as the world’s most unlikely mass murderer. However, the script is so lusterless, the pacing so leaden and the psychology so poorly worked out, that the pic doesn’t even work as a black comedy. Later gore scenes just look silly.&quot;

In 1999, Mike Emery of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; also had a mixed review, writing &quot;perhaps Sherman should have concentrated on the realistic terror of staff meetings, &#x27;casual day&#x27;, and the office lunch room. Instead, we get frequent images that are typical of most horror movies and not really worth revisiting.&quot; AllMovie&#x27;s Mark Deming gave it two and a half out of five stars, writing &quot;where Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; ridiculed slasher flick clichés in a way that appealed to hip, seen-it-all youngsters, Sherman&#x27;s angle is more subversive as she seeks to uncover the serial killer lurking inside the meek, the dispirited, and the neglected amongst us. In that undertaking, she couldn&#x27;t have gathered a better supporting cast.&quot; The film was included in &quot;Magill&#x27;s Cinema Annual 1998: A Survey of the Films of 1997&quot;, with the book stating that &quot;&quot;Office Killer&quot; is engaging because it raises questions about human identity in a sly, comic fashion&quot;

<text>The Wallasey Dock, was a dock at Birkenhead, Wirral Peninsula, England. The dock was accessed via East Float to the west, until Wallasey Dock was filled at the turn of the millennium.

==History==
Construction began in 1874 and the dock opened in 1877, replacing the Great Low Water Basin of 1863, which had opened directly onto the River Mersey to the east. Situated between Alfred Dock to the north and Morpeth Dock to the south, access to the river was westwards through East Float.

The dock sheds were used for grain storage and then for imported livestock. In 1890, a pumping station was installed on the river wall adjoining to the dock. This slowly silted the dock, and by the 1960s the dock had silted up, leaving the dock derelict by 1992.

In 2001, Wallasey Dock was filled to provide space for a vehicle park at the new Twelve Quays roll on-roll off ferry terminal nearby.

<doc id="1146944" wikidata="Q232035" url="?curid=1146944" title="Francesca Caccini">
<text>Francesca Caccini (; 18 September 1587 – between 1641 and 1645 most likely; or she may have remarried.) was an Italian composer, singer, lutenist, poet, and music teacher of the early Baroque era. She was also known by the nickname &quot;La Cecchina&quot; , given to her by the Florentines and probably a diminutive of &quot;Francesca&quot;. She was the daughter of Giulio Caccini. Her only surviving stage work, &quot;La liberazione di Ruggiero&quot;, is widely considered the oldest opera by a woman composer. As a female composer she helped to solidify the agency and the cultural and political programs of her female patron.

==Personal life==

=== Early life ===
Caccini was born in Florence, and received a humanistic education (Latin, some Greek, as well as modern languages and literature, mathematics) in addition to early musical training with her father. According to Liliana Panella, the first well-founded testimony of Francesca&#x27;s singer&#x27;s activity, together with her sister Settimia, at the Medici court, is 1602: in his diary Cesare Tinghi notes that on 3 April 1602 St. Nicholas church in Pisa, where the court moved every year during Lent, polychoral music was directed by &quot;Giulio Romano [Giulio Caccini], having the wife (the second wife, Margherita) and the two daughters singing well&quot;.

In her early life, Caccini performed with her parents, her half-brother Pompeo, her sister Settimia, and possibly other unnamed Caccini pupils in an ensemble contemporaries referred to as &quot;le donne di Giulio Romano&quot;. After she was hired by the court, she continued to perform with the family ensemble until Settimia&#x27;s marriage and resulting move to Mantua caused its breakup. Caccini served the Medici court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until early 1627. By 1614 she was the court&#x27;s most highly paid musician, in no small part because her musical virtuosity so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany&#x27;s de facto Regent, Grand-Duchess Christina of Lorraine. By 1623 she earned 240 scudi.

=== Later life ===
After Caccini&#x27;s first husband (Giovanni Battista Signorini, with whom she had one daughter, Margherita, in 1622) died in December 1626, she quickly arranged to marry again in October 1627, this time to a music-loving nobleman in Lucca, Tommaso Raffaelli. Although her legal name remained Francesca de Giulio Caccini, it was only the discovery of documents using Francesca Raffaelli that makes it possible to find evidence of her life from 1627 to 1634. 
She lived in Raffaelli&#x27;s Lucchese homes, apparently bearing a son (also Tommaso, in 1628), and having some musical relationship to the Buonvisi family in Lucca, until his death in 1630. Although as the wife of a nobleman she had declined at least one request to perform (in Parma, in 1628), once she was widowed Caccini immediately tried to return to serve the Medici court. Her return delayed by the plagues of 1630–33, by 1634 Caccini was back in Florence with her two children, serving as music teacher not only to her daughter Margherita but also to the Medici princesses who lived at or frequently visited the convent of La Crocetta, and composing and performing chamber music and minor entertainments for the women&#x27;s court. Caccini stopped serving the Medicis on 8 May 1641, and disappeared from the public record.

== Professional career ==
Caccini is believed to have been a quick and prolific composer, equal in productivity to her court colleagues Jacopo Peri and Marco da Gagliano. Very little of her music survives. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies by poet Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger (grand-nephew of the artist) such as &quot;La Tancia&quot; (1613), &quot;Il passatempo&quot; (1614) and &quot;La fiera&quot; (1619). In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets (&quot;Il primo libro delle musiche&quot;) that is a compendium of contemporary styles, ranging from intensely moving, harmonically adventurous laments to joyful sacred songs in Italian and Latin, to witty strophic songs about the joys and perils of romantic love.

In winter 1625 Caccini composed all the music for a 75-minute &quot;comedy-ballet&quot; entitled &quot;La liberazione di Ruggiero dall&#x27;isola d&#x27;Alcina&quot; which was performed for the visiting crown prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismondo (later Władysław IV). Combining witty parodies of early opera&#x27;s stock scenes and self-important characters with moments of surprising emotional intensity, the score shows that Caccini had mastered the full range of musico-theatrical devices in her time and that she had had a strong sense of large-scale musical design. &quot;La liberazione&quot; so pleased the prince that he had it performed in Warsaw in 1628. This is also widely regarded as the first opera written by a woman. There is no evidence to suggest that Caccini composed any of the accompanying poetry, however, which is instead by her contemporaries Michelangelo Buonarroti, Andrea Salvadori and Francesco Gualterotti.

=== Compositional style ===
Caccini&#x27;s musical and compositional style has been likened to that of Monteverdi and Jacopo Peri, and she started composing music after the closing of the Renaissance period, playing a key part in developing the Baroque style of music. She composed within a very innovative musical context. For many of her songs, she was the author of the accompanying poetry, which also tended to be comedic.

Although the musical pieces did not denote a specific instrument for playing the accompaniment, a theorbo could be used.

==Works==
Francesca Caccini wrote some or all of the music for at least six staged works. All but &quot;La liberazione di Ruggiero&quot; and some excerpts from &quot;La Tancia&quot; and &quot;Il passatempo&quot; published in the 1618 collection are believed lost. Her surviving scores reveal Caccini to have taken extraordinary care over the notation of her music, focusing special attention on the rhythmic placement of syllables and words, and on the precise notation of often very long, melodically fluid vocal melismas. Although her music is not especially notable for the expressive dissonances made fashionable by her contemporary Monteverdi, Caccini was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates affect.

<text>In structural geology, a syncline is a fold with younger layers closer to the center of the structure, whereas an anticline is the inverse of a syncline. A synclinorium (plural synclinoriums or synclinoria) is a large syncline with superimposed smaller folds. Synclines are typically a downward fold (synform), termed a synformal syncline (i.e. a trough), but synclines that point upwards can be found when strata have been overturned and folded (an antiformal syncline).

==Characteristics==
On a geologic map, synclines are recognized as a sequence of rock layers, with the youngest at the fold&#x27;s center or &quot;hinge&quot; and with a reverse sequence of the same rock layers on the opposite side of the hinge. If the fold pattern is circular or elongate, the structure is a basin. Folds typically form during crustal deformation as the result of compression that accompanies orogenic mountain building.

==Notable examples==
* Powder River Basin, Wyoming, US
* Sideling Hill roadcut along Interstate 68 in western Maryland, US, where the Rockwell Formation and overlying Purslane Sandstone are exposed
* Forêt de Saou syncline in Saou, France
* Southland Syncline in the southeastern corner of the South Island of New Zealand, including The Catlins and the Hokonui Hills
* Strathmore Syncline, Scotland
* Wilpena Pound, Flinders Ranges, South Australia
* Fort Valley, Shenandoah County, Virginia
* Hondo Syncline in the Picuris Mountains of New Mexico, an example of an overturned syncline
*Afikpo syncline, Nigeria

<doc id="1146961" wikidata="Q7118699" url="?curid=1146961" title="PC Format">
<text>PC Format was a computer magazine published in the United Kingdom by Future plc, and licensed to other publishers in countries around the world. In publication between 1991 and 2015, it was part of Future plc&#x27;s &quot;Format&quot; series of magazines that include articles about games, entertainment and how to get the most out of the platform. Despite the occasional mention of alternatives, &quot;PC Format&quot; takes the term &#x27;PC&#x27; to mean a Microsoft Windows-based computer.

==Details==

Aimed at a reader with an age of around 30, &quot;PCF&quot; was far more irreverent and opinionated than its competition, edging it towards being a lifestyle magazine as well as a computing one. In its earlier days, it promoted itself as a PC entertainment magazine - meaning it was not aimed at the business market, and it was not aimed at solely games. This included content such as video editing, animation, web design, and others - many of which were not very common on the PC at the time.

&quot;PC Format&quot; included a cover disk or cover CD, similar to many other computer magazines. Initially these were in 5¼&quot; and 3½&quot; inch floppy disk formats; this standard progressed to CD-ROM and DVD-ROM as technology advanced.

&quot;PC Format&quot; prided itself on being unbiased with its reviews, and frequently gave low scores to blockbuster games its reviewers considered poor quality. It used the full range of 0-100% for its game reviews, rather than having 50% for a bad game and 100% for a great game. The magazine rarely awarded anything between 30% and 50%, showing radical scores for games with the belief mediocre games are difficult to review. Scores over 90% were very rarely granted. If a game scored above 90% it received a PCF Gold award. Before the magazine was redesigned in January 2007, the magazine also awarded 80% plus scores with a high score or top gear award.

Immediately prior to &quot;PC Format&quot;&#x27;s launch, the &quot;Format&quot; series encompassed three platforms - &quot;Commodore Format&quot;, &quot;ST Format&quot; and &quot;Amiga Format&quot;. The magazines in the &#x27;Format&#x27; series on the date of its last publication were &quot;MacFormat&quot; (launched 1993), &quot;Linux Format&quot; (launched 2000), and &quot;PC Format&quot;; as of 2023 only &quot;MacFormat&quot; and &quot;Linux Format&quot; are still published.

PCFormat&#x27;s website was part of the TechRadar.com network of sites, Future plc&#x27;s technology portal.

==Content==
The main content of the magazine included previews and reviews of the latest games, software and hardware reviews, computing news, a wide range of tutorials and a technical help section. It also included left-field and investigative features on wider computing culture. Since the final redesign, the magazine focused more on games (PLAY) and performance hardware (WIRED), instead of the greater range previously explored. There was then also a much greater emphasis on Overclocking and Modding articles, keeping in line with the new performance hardware and gaming focus.

The magazine gradually shifted its focus away from games, concentrating more on hardware. As of the September 2010 issue, typically no more than four games were reviewed each month.

==Format as of January 2007==

* Download: Technology and PC news, previously included monthly Guerrilla Testing for solving often irrelevant computing issues. (For example: What are the best gloves to wear whilst fitting a graphics card?)
* Upload: Readers&#x27; letters and monthly competition.
* Play: Games previews and reviews. Included features such as in-depth guides, recommended games and a &quot;Replay&quot; review.
* Wired: Hardware reviews, included a main in-depth supertest comparison with benchmarks, a smaller &quot;roundup&quot; group test and technology previews. As of 2008, PC modding features; overclocking tips, &quot;I Am The Mod&quot;, Quick Fix tutorials and custom hardware guide found in the now defunct &quot;HOTWIRED&quot; section are found here.
* Features: Not an individual section of the magazine, but every issue came with in-depth game or hardware articles that were featured in either Play or Wired.
* Regular items:
** Welcome
** Disc Pages
** Ask Luis: Readers&#x27; computing questions were answered by Technology writer Luis Villazon. Includes &quot;Luis and Ned&quot; cartoon strip.
** Jim&#x27;s Black Hole: Science News (previously Jackass Science)
** Next Month preview

==Final Team==

* Editor: Alan Dexter. Past editors include Adam Ifans, Bob Wade, Mark Higham, Dan Slingsby, Adam Oxford, Dan Hutchinson, James Binns and Richard Longhurst.
* Art Editor: Paul Blachford
* Deputy Editor: Dave James
* Operations Editor: Chris Thornett

<doc id="1146962" wikidata="Q2714920" url="?curid=1146962" title="Maceo Baston">
<text>Maceo Demond Baston (born May 29, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball at the University of Michigan. At a playing height of , and a playing weight of , he played at the power forward position.

==High school==
Baston attended H. Grady Spruce High School, in Dallas, Texas, where he played basketball.

==College career==
After graduating from high school, Baston played college basketball at the University of Michigan. At Michigan, he was part of an all-star recruiting class that included Maurice Taylor, Travis Conlon, Jerod Ward, and Willie Mitchell. He was known for his above-average dunking ability, and tenacious defense. Baston averaged 10.7 points and 6.6 rebounds a game for his Michigan career, which included NCAA Tournament appearances in 1995 and 1998, and the National Invitation Tournament Championship in 1997. Michigan later forfeited its entire 1996–97 season schedule, after Robert Traylor, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock were found to have taken money from a Michigan booster.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Baston was drafted in the second round (58th overall), by the Chicago Bulls, in 1998, but he did not appear in any games for them. He then played for the Quad City Thunder in the CBA from 1998 to 2000, where he was a CBA All-Star in 2000. He was honored as the CBA Defensive Player of the Year, and selected to the All-CBA First Team and All-Defensive Team in 2000. After that, he played in Europe. He played in Italy (SC Montecatini), and in Spain (Joventut Badalona).

===Toronto Raptors===
After playing in Europe, Baston played with the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors (February–April 2003).

===Maccabi Tel Aviv===
After playing with the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors, Baston moved to the Israeli League club Maccabi Tel Aviv. While with Maccabi, Baston set the EuroLeague Final Four record for blocks in a game, with 6 versus Tau Ceramica, in the 2006 EuroLeague Semifinals.

===Indiana Pacers===
On July 28, 2006, the NBA&#x27;s Indiana Pacers signed Baston to a two-year deal, worth $1.8 million, with the second year being a player option. He appeared in 47 games with the team, and averaged 3 points per game.

===Return to Raptors===
On July 11, 2007, Baston signed an offer sheet to return to the Raptors, worth roughly US$3.8 million, over two years. The Pacers declined to match the offer.

===Return to Pacers===
The Pacers reacquired Baston on July 9, 2008, in a trade with the Raptors, which also included Jermaine O&#x27;Neal and T. J. Ford.

===Detroit Pistons===
Baston, along with point guard Chucky Atkins, signed non-guaranteed contracts with the Detroit Pistons, on September 28, 2009. The Pistons waived Baston on October 21, 2009.

===Budivelnyk Kyiv===
Despite having contract conversations with the Serbian club Partizan Belgrade, Baston instead signed with the Ukrainian club Budivelnyk Kyiv, on March 1, 2010. However, he only played in one game with the club, due to physical problems he was having at the time.

===Bnei HaSharon===
In November 2010, Baston returned to Israel, signing with Bnei HaSharon. However, after playing in seven games with the club, he left the team in January 2011.

<text>The Ghost Writer is a 1979 novel by the American author Philip Roth. It is the first of Roth&#x27;s novels narrated by Nathan Zuckerman, one of the author&#x27;s putative fictional alter egos, and constitutes the first book in his &quot;Zuckerman Bound&quot; trilogy. The novel touches on themes common to many Roth works, including identity, the responsibilities of authors to their subjects, and the condition of Jews in America. Parts of the novel are a reprise of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.

== Plot introduction==
Nathan Zuckerman is a promising young writer who spends a night in the home of E.I. Lonoff (a portrait, it has been argued, of Bernard Malamud or Henry Roth, or a composite of both), an established author whom Zuckerman idolizes. Also staying in the Lonoff home is Amy Bellette, a young woman with a vague past whom the narrator apparently comes to suspect of being Anne Frank, living in the United States anonymously, having survived the Holocaust. Many have observed similarities between Lonoff and Isaac Bashevis Singer.

==Television movie==
In 1983 a television adaptation was made of the book in the UK. It was directed by Tristram Powell and starred Rose Arrick, Claire Bloom, Sam Wanamaker, Cecile Mann, MacIntyre Dixon, Mark Linn-Baker, Ralph Morse, Joseph Wiseman, and Patricia Fellows.

==Critical reception==
The book was widely praised at publication. In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, critic Harold Bloom said of the three collected Zuckerman novels, &quot;&quot;Zuckerman Bound&quot; merits something reasonably close to the highest level of esthetic praise for tragicomedy.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; was listed as one of Roth&#x27;s seven essential books.

==Awards==
The Pulitzer committee for fiction selected &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; for the prize in 1980. The Pulitzer board, which has final say over awarding the prize, overrode their decision and chose Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; instead. The book was also a finalist for the 1980 National Book Award.

==&quot;Exit Ghost&quot;==
In 2007, Roth published the novel &quot;Exit Ghost&quot;, which Michiko Kakutani in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;elegiac&quot; and &quot;a kind of valedictory bookend to &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1146973" wikidata="Q1365374" url="?curid=1146973" title="Patriot (American Revolution)">
<text>Patriots (also known as Revolutionaries, Continentals, Rebels, or Whigs) were colonists in the Thirteen Colonies who opposed the Kingdom of Great Britain&#x27;s control and governance during the colonial era and supported and helped launch the American Revolution that ultimately established American independence. Patriot politicians led colonial opposition to British policies regarding the American colonies, eventually building support for the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted unanimously by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. After the American Revolutionary War began the year before, in 1775, many patriots assimilated into the Continental Army, which was commanded by George Washington and which secured victory against the British Army, leading the British to acknowledge the sovereign independence of the colonies, reflected in the Treaty of Paris, which led to the establishment of the United States in 1783.

The patriots were inspired by English and American republican ideology that was part of the Age of Enlightenment, and rejected monarchy and aristocracy and supported individual liberty and natural rights and legal rights. Prominent patriot political theorists such as Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Thomas Paine spearheaded the American Enlightenment, which was in turn inspired by European thinkers such as Francis Bacon, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Though slavery existed in all of the Thirteen Colonies prior to the American Revolution, the issue divided patriots, with some supporting its abolition while others espoused proslavery thought.

The patriots included members of every social and ethnic group in the colonies, though support for the patriot cause was strongest in the New England Colonies and weakest in the Southern Colonies. The American Revolution divided the colonial population into three groups: patriots, who supported the end of British rule; loyalists, who supported Britain&#x27;s continued control over the colonies; and those who remained neutral. African Americans who supported the patriots were known as Black Patriots, with their counterparts on the British side being referred to as Black Loyalists. 

==Terminology==
The critics of British policy towards the Thirteen Colonies called themselves &quot;Whigs&quot; after 1768, identifying with members of the British Whig party who favored similar colonial policies. Samuel Johnson writes that, at the time, the word &quot;patriot&quot; had a negative connotation and was used as a negative epithet for &quot;a factious disturber of the government&quot;.

Prior to the American Revolution, colonists who supported British authority called themselves Tories or royalists, identifying with the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism as it existed in Great Britain. During the American Revolution, these persons became known primarily as Loyalists. Afterward, some 15% of Loyalists emigrated north to the remaining British territories in the Canadas. There they called themselves the United Empire Loyalists. 85% of the Loyalists decided to stay in the new United States and were granted American citizenship.

==Composition==
Prior to the formal beginning of the American Revolution, many patriots were active in groups including the Sons of Liberty. The most prominent patriot leaders are referred to today as the Founding Fathers, who are generally defined as the 56 men who, as delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, signed the Declaration of Independence. 

Patriots included a cross-section of the population of the Thirteen Colonies and came from varying backgrounds. Roughly 40 to 45 percent of the white population in the Thirteen Colonies supported the patriots&#x27; cause, between 15 and 20 percent supported the Loyalists, and the remainder were neutral or kept a low profile regarding their loyalties. The great majority of Loyalists remained in the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution; a minority, however, fled the nation for Canada, Great Britain, Florida, or the West Indies.

==Motivations==
Historians have explored the motivations that pulled men to one side or the other. Yale historian Leonard Woods Labaree used the published and unpublished writings and letters of leading men on each side, searching for how personality shaped their choice. He finds eight characteristics that differentiated the two groups. Loyalists were older, better established, and more likely to resist innovation than the patriots. Loyalists felt that the Crown was the legitimate government and resistance to it was morally wrong, while the patriots felt that morality was on their side because the British government had violated the constitutional rights of Englishmen. Men who were alienated by physical attacks on Royal officials took the Loyalist position, while those who were offended by British responses to actions such as the Boston Tea Party became patriots. Merchants in the port cities with long-standing financial attachments to Britain were likely to remain loyal, while few patriots were so deeply enmeshed in the system. Some Loyalists, according to Labaree, were &quot;procrastinators&quot; who believed that independence was bound to come some day but wanted to &quot;postpone the moment&quot;, while the patriots wanted to &quot;seize the moment&quot;. Loyalists were cautious and afraid of anarchy or tyranny that might come from mob rule; patriots made a systematic effort to take a stand against the British government. Finally, Labaree argues that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the patriots&#x27; confidence that independence lay ahead.

The patriots rejected taxes imposed by legislatures in which the taxpayer was not represented. &quot;No taxation without representation&quot; was their slogan, referring to the lack of representation in the British Parliament. The British countered that there was &quot;virtual representation&quot; in the sense that all members of Parliament represented the interests of all the citizens of the British Empire. Some patriots declared that they were loyal to the king, but they insisted that they should be free to run their own affairs. In fact, they had been running their own affairs since the period of &quot;salutary neglect&quot; before the French and Indian War. Some radical patriots tarred and feathered tax collectors and customs officers, making those positions dangerous; according to Benjamin Irvin, the practice was especially prevalent in Boston where many patriots lived.

<text>Isabella of Aragon ( 1247 – 28 January 1271), was Queen of France from 1270 to 1271 by marriage to Philip III of France. 

== Life ==
Isabella was the eighth child and youngest daughter of King James I of Aragon and his second wife, Violant of Hungary. Her exact date of birth was not recorded, but she certainly was born in late 1247 or early 1248 since her father, who financially supported the Monastery of Santa María de Sigena, stipulated in his will in January 1248 that if he had another son, he should become a knight Templar and if the child was a daughter, she should enter Santa María de Sigena as a nun. The will was certainly abandoned before Isabella&#x27;s birth because she was married.

On 11 May 1258, the Treaty of Corbeil was concluded between Isabella&#x27;s father and King Louis IX of France. As part of the agreement a betrothal was arranged between Louis&#x27;s second son, Philip, and Isabella, the youngest daughter of James I. The formal wedding took place on 28 May 1262 at the city of Clairmont (currently Clermont-Ferrand); by that time, Philip was already the heir apparent to the French throne due to the death of his older brother, Louis, in 1260. 

Having accompanied her husband and father-in-law on the Eighth Crusade against Tunis in July 1270, Isabella became queen of France the following month on the death of King Louis IX. On their way home, while crossing the Savuto river near Martirano in Calabria, on 11 January 1271 she suffered a fall from her horse: six months pregnant with her fifth child, she gave birth prematurely to a son, who died soon after. First transported to Martirano Castle and then to Cosenza, exhausted and feverish, Isabella died there on 28 January 1271 aged 24. Her death was a devastating emotional blow to her husband, especially since she had been pregnant.

Because she died far from her homeland, the funeral technique of &quot;Mos Teutonicus&quot; was practiced upon Isabella. Firstly, she was buried at Cosenza Cathedral alongside her newborn son, and then in the royal necropolis in the Basilica of St Denis. Isabella&#x27;s tomb, like many others, was desecrated during the French Revolution in August 1793. 

The tragic end of Isabella is recalled in the &quot;Laudi&quot; of the poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio.

==Political campaigns==
In 2004 United States House of Representatives elections, Boren ran for Oklahoma&#x27;s second congressional district to succeed fellow Democrat Brad Carson, who was retiring from the House to run for the United States Senate. He won the primary with 58% of the vote, and then defeated Republican candidate Wayland Smalley in the general election by more than 85,000 votes (66% to 34%) and was inaugurated in the 109th Congress in January 2005. Boren was one of only two politicians endorsed by country singer Toby Keith, the other being President George W. Bush. Boren was reelected in 2006, 2008 and 2010. In 2010, Boren was challenged in the Democratic primary by State Senator Jim Wilson, who ran as a more liberal candidate, but Boren won with over 75% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Republican Charles Thompson by a margin of 13%, despite the Republican wave that swept the nation that year.

Boren was known as one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, but his conservatism fit the political demographics of his district. The 2nd was once a Democratic stronghold, but has become increasingly friendly to Republicans as Tulsa&#x27;s suburbs have begun to encroach on the district and the rural areas have trended right. The district has voted for the Republican candidate in the 2000, 2004, and 2008 Presidential elections, by double-digit margins in the latter two years. Additionally, the Democrats in the district tend to be more socially and fiscally conservative than their national counterparts.

Boren considered a run for Governor of Oklahoma in 2018 before deciding to stay in his position with the Chickasaw Nation.

== Electoral history ==









==Business career==
After leaving Congress in 2013, Boren began work as President of Corporate Development for the Chickasaw Nation. He held this position until December 2019, when he was named Chief Banking Officer and Oklahoma President of First United Bank, one of the largest banking institutions in the Southwest. He returned to the Chickasaw Nation as Secretary of Commerce in May 2022, succeeding Bill Lance. In June 2022, Boren was appointed to First United Bank&#x27;s board of directors.

==Personal life==
Boren is married to Andrea Heupel, who is the sister of Josh Heupel, the former starting quarterback who led the Oklahoma Sooners to win the 2000 BCS National Championship and later head football coach of the Tennessee Volunteers. Boren and his family live in Oklahoma City with their two children. Boren is a member of the Episcopal Church.

<text>Sabarmati Ashram (also known as Gandhi Ashram) is located in the Sabarmati suburb of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, adjoining the Ashram Road, on the banks of the River Sabarmati, from the town hall. This was one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi who lived at Sabarmati (Gujarat) and Sevagram (Wardha, Maharashtra) when he was not travelling across India or in prison. He lived in Sabarmati or Wardha for a total of twelve years with his wife Kasturba Gandhi and followers, including Vinoba Bhave. The Bhagavad Gita was recited here daily as part of the Ashram schedule.

It was from here that Gandhi led the Dandi March, also known as the Salt Satyagraha on 12 March 1930. In recognition of the significant influence that this march had on the Indian independence movement, the Indian government has established the ashram as a national monument.

==History of Ashram==

While at the ashram, Gandhi formed a tertiary school that focused on manual labor, agriculture, and literacy, in order to advance his efforts for the nation&#x27;s self-sufficiency. It was also from here that on 12 March 1930, Gandhi marched to Dandi, 241 miles from the ashram, with 78 companions in protest at the British Salt Law, which increased the taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India. It was this march and the subsequent illegal production of salt (Gandhi boiled up some salty mud in seawater) that spurred hundreds of thousands across India to join in the illegal production, buying, or selling of salt. This mass act of civil disobedience in turn led to the imprisoning of some 60,000 by the British Raj over the following three weeks. Subsequently, the government seized the ashram. Gandhi later asked the Government to give it back but they were unwilling. By 22 July 1933, he had already decided to disband the ashram, which had become a deserted place after the detention of so many. Then local citizens decided to preserve it. On 12 March 1930, Gandhi vowed that he would not return to the ashram until India had gained independence and Gandhi did not come back to Sabarmati ashram. Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948.

==Present day==
The ashram now has a museum, the Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya. This had originally been located in Hridaya Kunj, Gandhi&#x27;s own cottage in the ashram. Then in 1963, having been designed by the architect Charles Correa, the museum was built. The Sangrahalaya was then re-located into the well-designed and well-furnished museum building and was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India on 10 May 1963. Memorial activities could then continue.

Many buildings in the Ashram have names. There is a rich history of Gandhi&#x27;s naming practices. At least some of the names of the buildings in the ashram, such as Nandini, and Rustom Block date back to the nineteen twenties, as is evident in a letter Gandhi wrote to Chhaganlal Joshi, the Ashram&#x27;s new manager after Maganlal Gandhi&#x27;s death in April 1928.

Some of the names of the buildings and sites within the ashram are:
*Nandini: This is an old ashram guest house where visitors from India and abroad are accommodated. It is situated on the right hand side of &quot;Hridaya Kunj&quot;.
*Vinoba Kutir: This cottage is named after Acharya Vinoba Bhave who stayed here. Today It is also known as Mira Kutir after Gandhiji&#x27;s disciple Mirabehn who later lived there, following Gandhi&#x27;s principles. She was the daughter of a British Rear-Admiral.
*Upasana Mandir: This is an open-air prayer ground, where after Prayers Gandhiji would refer to individual&#x27;s questions and as head of family would try to analyse and solve these queries. It is situated between Hridaya Kunj and Magan Nivas.
*Magan Niwas: This hut used to be the home of the ashram manager, Maganlal Gandhi. Maganlal was the cousin of Gandhi who he called the soul of the ashram.

<doc id="1146982" wikidata="Q339289" url="?curid=1146982" title="J. R. Ewing">
<text>John Ross Ewing Jr. is a fictional character in the American television series &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978–1991) and its spin-offs, including the continuation series (2012–2014). The character was portrayed by Larry Hagman from the series premiere in 1978 until his death in late 2012; Hagman was the only actor who appeared in all 357 episodes of the original series. As the show&#x27;s most famous character, J.R. has been central to many of the series&#x27; biggest storylines. He is depicted as a covetous, egocentric, manipulative and amoral oil baron with psychopathic tendencies, who is constantly plotting subterfuges to plunder the wealth of his foes. In the PBS series &quot;Pioneers of Television&quot;, Hagman claimed the character of J.R. began its development when he played a similar character in the film &quot;Stardust&quot;, and that he was also inspired by a mean boss he once had.

The focus of the series was initially the feuding families, with J.R. just a supporting character, but his popularity grew and the producers acknowledged he became the breakout character. Two highly rated 1980 episodes became part of a cultural phenomenon that year known as &quot;Who shot J.R.?&quot;. In &quot;A House Divided&quot;, the audience witnessed J.R. being shot by an unknown assailant.

After the cliffhanger was broadcast in March, the audience had to wait until the November conclusion, &quot;Who Done It&quot;. With his new-found popularity, Hagman threatened to leave the series unless his contractual demands were met. CBS leaked rumors of recasting, but the actor eventually prevailed. He also appeared in five episodes of spin-off series &quot;Knots Landing&quot; between 1980 and 1982. The character is featured in the first two seasons of the 2012 reincarnation series as well. Hagman died on November 23, 2012, and &quot;Dallas&quot; producers subsequently announced that J.R. would be killed off in the second season. The episode &quot;The Furious and the Fast&quot; dealt with J.R.&#x27;s death.

J.R. Ewing is considered one of television&#x27;s most popular characters, with &quot;TV Guide&quot; naming him #1 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him #11 of their &quot;40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time&quot;. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll in the U.K. he was ranked 38th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

== Character ==
J.R. has a reputation with his fellow characters, and viewers of the show, as a &#x27;bad man&#x27;. He has a ruthless approach to business and frequently engages in bribery, blackmail and other underhand tactics to defeat and destroy his rivals - his principal nemesis being Cliff Barnes. He appears heartless much of the time—indeed taking pride in his nefarious nature. However, there are several instances throughout the original series&#x27; run where a more sympathetic and complex side to his character is portrayed, such as evidence of his love for his family. Also in the final season, there are glimpses of a depressive and contemplative nature when musing to Bobby during their cattle drive about how times were changing.

The name “JR” is an homage to the “JR” for Jett Rink in the movie &quot;Giant&quot;. Jett Rink was the last character played by James Dean before his death. Oil tycoon H. L. Hunt served as loose inspiration for the character of Ewing.

== Storylines ==

=== Original series ===
J.R. Ewing was the eldest son of John Ross &quot;Jock&quot; Ewing Sr. (Jim Davis) and Eleanor &quot;Miss Ellie&quot; Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes, briefly Donna Reed). J.R. was born on the family&#x27;s Southfork Ranch. The year of his birth is inconsistent: in &quot;&quot;, Miss Ellie announces her pregnancy with J.R. in 1936, making the year of his birth 1936 or at the latest 1937, while in the 2012 continuation of &quot;Dallas&quot;, J.R.&#x27;s gravestone gives his birth year as 1939.

J.R. has two younger brothers, Gary (Ted Shackelford, briefly David Ackroyd) and Bobby (Patrick Duffy); a half-brother, Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly), from his father&#x27;s affair with an Army nurse named Margaret Hunter during World War II.

Starting at age five, J.R. was groomed to be the heir apparent to his father Jock at Ewing Oil, an independent oil company that Jock ran in a very cutthroat, ruthless manner. After coming home from serving for a short time in the Vietnam War during the 1960s, J.R. began his long tenure as an employee of Ewing Oil. He had no interest in working on Southfork Ranch, which was mostly the domain of his mother Miss Ellie, and brothers Bobby and Ray Krebbs, but he did have a strong desire to keep Southfork in the family. Gary was mostly influenced by his mother and embraced the Southworth tradition of ranching on Southfork and had no interest in Ewing Oil. Like their father Jock, J.R. saw Gary as weak, lacking the Ewing character and growing up Gary was unable to stand up to J.R.&#x27;s bullying. A teenage Gary met his wife Valene Clements (Joan Van Ark) in the early 1960s, they married when she became pregnant with their daughter Lucy (Charlene Tilton). J.R. did not approve of Gary marrying someone of Valene&#x27;s status. When their marriage began to disintegrate, Gary left Southfork leaving Valene and Lucy. When Valene attempted to leave with Lucy, J.R. had her run out of town and took Lucy back to live with the Ewings at Southfork. In 1979, Gary and Valene reunited in Dallas and remarried, but rather than try to live at Southfork again, they left to go and live in the California suburb of &quot;Knots Landing&quot;.

Bobby spent his time alternating between Southfork and Ewing Oil, and was Jock&#x27;s favorite son. This made J.R. enormously determined to impress Jock, but despite his huge success in the oil business, J.R. was never able to overcome Jock&#x27;s favoritism for Bobby. This led to a rivalry between them in childhood that continued as they grew up, especially when Bobby married Pamela Barnes (Victoria Principal, briefly Margaret Michaels), who was a member of the Ewings&#x27; rival family. The legendary Barnes-Ewing feud began in the 1930s between Jock and Pam&#x27;s legal father Digger (Keenan Wynn, originally David Wayne) after their partnership in the oil business dissolved due to Digger&#x27;s alcoholism and resentment. Jock had earlier married Digger&#x27;s girlfriend, Eleanor Southworth, which had caused a dent in their relationship prior to the big schism. The feud continued on decades later with J.R. and Digger&#x27;s son Cliff (Ken Kercheval).

In 1971, J.R. married Sue Ellen Shepard (Linda Gray), a former &quot;Miss Texas&quot;. Their marriage became increasingly turbulent with J.R. ignoring her first with Ewing Oil then philandering with other women. By the late 1970s Sue Ellen had become an alcoholic. They divorced in 1981 only to remarry in 1982 and divorce again in 1988. In 1989 Sue Ellen moves to London with her new lover Don Lockwood (Ian McShane), they marry in 1991.

J.R. had two wives and three children during the show&#x27;s run. His eldest son, James Richard Beaumont (Sasha Mitchell), was by an off-screen affair with Vanessa Beaumont (Gayle Hunnicutt) which occurred in the 1960s but was only brought to knowledge in 1989. His second and most favored son was John Ross Ewing III (Omri Katz) from his first wife Sue Ellen, born in 1979. His third son was with his second wife Cally (Cathy Podewell) born in 1991, however, Cally didn&#x27;t give birth until after leaving Dallas.

J.R. also initially believed he was the father of Christopher Ewing (Joshua Harris, originally Eric Farlow), the son of his sister-in-law and former mistress Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby), but it was later revealed J.R. was not the father. Christopher was adopted by Bobby and Pam. In addition to that, J.R.&#x27;s second wife Cally and his illegitimate son James successfully plotted to gain revenge on him. After JR kicked Cally off of Southfork he checked into a sanitarium in order to get Clayton Farlow&#x27;s sister, Jessica Montford, to sign over voting rights in WestStar stock to him. Unbeknownst to him, James and Cally managed to get his release papers from his lawyer, Walter Berman. James pretended to be his lawyer and ultimately left him in the sanitarium. Cally eventually freed him. This was the start of what would eventually be a year where J.R. lost everything.

First, he lost control of Ewing Oil to Cliff, then was fired at West Star Oil by a vengeful Carter McKay (George Kennedy). To top it all off, he lost control of Southfork and was disowned by his son who moved to Europe to be with Sue Ellen. All J.R. was left with was a room in Southfork that Bobby let him stay in and not much else. Contemplating suicide, the character roamed the lonely Southfork with a bottle of bourbon and a loaded revolver. A being, later revealed to be demonic, named Adam (portrayed by Joel Grey) pays a visit to J.R., who cannot believe what he is seeing. The white tuxedo-clad Adam tells J.R. his &quot;boss&quot; likes him and has dispatched him to Earth. In a parallel with the storyline of the movie &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, Adam proceeds to take J.R. on a journey to show him what life would have been like for other people if he had not been born.

After being taken through this journey, Adam tries to get J.R. to shoot himself. J.R. tells Adam he does not want to give Adam the satisfaction as he went back to Heaven. Adam then asks J.R. what made him think he was dispatched from Heaven and begins laughing demonically, revealing his true purpose. J.R. is immediately jolted awake in his bedroom while still holding the bourbon bottle and the revolver. He appears relieved that it was only a nightmare, but once again, Adam appears to J.R., this time in the bedroom mirror in a red suit. Adam is determined to have J.R. shoot himself, reminding him of reality for J.R. and the current state of his life and how better off everyone concerned would be. J.R. seems willing to oblige.

Meanwhile, Bobby has returned to Southfork for the night. J.R. does not hear him pull up or enter the house, as his focus is solely on Adam in his mirror. He slowly raises the gun to his head and cocks the hammer, and the frustrated Adam finally screams &quot;Do it!&quot; to J.R. with glowing red eyes. Bobby hears a gunshot and runs to the second floor to J.R.&#x27;s bedroom. As he reaches the doorway, he looks into the room and is horrified by what he sees, exclaiming &quot;Oh my God!&quot;. J.R.&#x27;s fate was not revealed. The &quot;Conundrum&quot; cliffhanger was not resolved until 1996, with the first &quot;Dallas&quot; reunion movie, &quot;&quot;. It was revealed in the beginning of the movie that J.R. had not, in fact, shot himself, but had instead shot at the mirror where the demon Adam was appearing to him. The 2012 revival series does not follow the reunion film, but shows J.R. still alive. According to the Dallas Facebook page, J.R. had indeed shot the mirror, but unlike the Reunion film, he didn&#x27;t flee to Europe to recover.

=== &quot;Dallas&quot; (2012) ===
J.R. returns in the 2012 revival of the series, which focuses on J.R.&#x27;s son John Ross Ewing III and Bobby&#x27;s adopted son Christopher Ewing. To J.R.&#x27;s delight, John Ross has become a carbon copy of him, in that he is more focused on oil, money and power. As the series begins J.R. has spent the last few years in a nursing home, suffering from chronic depression and not speaking despite visits from Bobby. All the events of the two TV movies are ignored.

Bobby visits and tells J.R. that all of their fights over Ewing Oil and Southfork changed him in ways he doesn&#x27;t like and that he wants Christopher and John Ross to be a real family and not be like them always fighting. When John Ross eventually visits him on Bobby&#x27;s suggestion, he says that Bobby plans to sell Southfork and give the money from the sale to Christopher to fund Christopher&#x27;s renewable energy project. John Ross also tells J.R. that he discovered a 2 billion barrel oil reserve under Southfork but Bobby has blocked the drilling. J.R. finally rouses himself to help his son fight the attempts to block his drilling for oil on the ranch and tells John Ross that Bobby was always a fool. He reveals that he is working alongside Marta Del Sol, the daughter of an old friend of J.R.&#x27;s, who owns millions of acres of land. Marta is supposedly offering a partnership to Bobby but it&#x27;s J.R. pulling the strings when Bobby signs Southfork to Marta&#x27;s conservatory, it&#x27;ll really be going to J.R. John Ross is really working alongside Marta, with J.R. seeing them together but not seeming to mind. J.R. surprises everyone by showing up at a family gathering (acting as an invalid by using a walker) and apologizing to Bobby and Sue Ellen for his past actions. He later goes to Mexico to see Marta&#x27;s father, Carlos Del Sol, but he knows nothing of any deal. He then introduces his daughter only she&#x27;s not the woman J.R. knows as Marta. Realizing he&#x27;s been fooled, J.R. tells Del Sol he&#x27;s made a mistake and bites out that Marta should meet his son as &quot;he&#x27;s a chip off the old block.&quot;

J.R. eventually succeeds in getting Southfork from Bobby and doesn&#x27;t waste any time in beginning to drill for oil on Southfork. He also cuts John Ross out of the partnership. However, he does give his son power of attorney to run his business ventures. J.R. is forced to return ownership of Southfork to Bobby when J.R. and John Ross&#x27; Venezuelan investor, Vicente Cano, turns violent against the Ewings when the loan isn&#x27;t repaid. J.R. and John Ross are given immunity and sign confessions against Cano, who is sent to prison. Bobby keeps a copy of J.R.&#x27;s confession and warns him that he will send J.R. to prison if he uses any more dirty tricks. John Ross&#x27; fiancée Elena Ramos discovers John Ross&#x27; role in the plot, she breaks up with him and returns to Christopher. The first season ends with John Ross and J.R. joining forces against Bobby, Christopher and Elena, who have apparently reunited as a couple.

At the start of the second season, J.R. is mentoring John Ross in business and dirty tricks and they are plotting to take control of Ewing Energies. J.R. also plots against his old rival Cliff Barnes and his daughter Pamela Rebecca Barnes, who is pregnant with Christopher&#x27;s twins and is having an affair with John Ross. Bobby asks for J.R.&#x27;s help to take down Harris Ryland when it&#x27;s revealed Ryland kidnapped Bobby&#x27;s stepdaughter Emma and let Bobby&#x27;s wife Ann think her daughter was dead. J.R. assures Bobby that he will take Ryland down. In the episode &quot;The Furious and the Fast&quot;, J.R. talks to John Ross by phone about a &quot;master plan&quot; to defeat Cliff Barnes and Harris Ryland and to help John Ross take control of Ewing Energies, saying it will be his &quot;masterpiece&quot; when somebody apparently walks into the room and shoots twice, killing him.

J.R.&#x27;s memorial was held at the Dallas Petroleum Club where many guests from his past attended. J.R.&#x27;s favorite drink, bourbon and branch was served. Guests included J.R.&#x27;s half-brother Ray Krebbs, niece Lucy Ewing, brothers Gary Ewing and Bobby Ewing, ex-wives Sue Ellen Ewing and Cally Harper Ewing, ex-mistress Mandy Winger, adopted nephew Christopher Ewing, Elena Ramos and her brother Drew Ramos and J.R.&#x27;s son John Ross Ewing III. Other notable guests included Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. J.R.&#x27;s funeral was held at the family cemetery plot on Southfork Ranch. Ray, Lucy, Gary, Christopher, Elena, Sue Ellen, and Bobby all spoke. J.R. was buried next to the graves of Jock and Miss Ellie. At his funeral, Sue Ellen read the letter that J.R. had written to her before he was murdered where he stated that he wanted another chance with her. Sue Ellen referred to J.R. as &quot;the love of my life&quot;. Since J.R. had been a war veteran, his coffin was draped in a U.S. Stars and Stripes flag and was handed folded to John Ross because he was his son and next-of-kin.

At the end of the funeral J.R.&#x27;s private investigator Bum Jones arrives at the gravesite. In the office at Southfork, Bum tells Bobby, John Ross, and Christopher that J.R. was in Abu Dhabi closing a deal to buy some oil leases but that his real reason for being in Abu Dhabi was because for the last several months he was trying to find Christopher&#x27;s adoptive mother and Bobby&#x27;s ex-wife Pamela Barnes Ewing. Bum gives Christopher some papers that would tell why it was important for Christopher to find Pam. Bum reveals that J.R. was in Nuevo Laredo following a lead to take down Harris Ryland using the quail hunt as a cover story. John Ross assumes that Ryland was behind his father&#x27;s murder but Bum says that J.R. was killed by a random mugger. John Ross is given a box containing a pistol and a note from J.R. telling John Ross that now that he is dead, Cliff Barnes and Ryland will join forces to take down the Ewings. The note also says John Ross should use the contents of the box &quot;to take from them what they want to take from us&quot; and that afterwards &quot;Bobby will know what to do.&quot; J.R. ends the note by telling John Ross not to forget that he is J.R.&#x27;s son &quot;from tip to tail&quot;. Bum gives a letter to Bobby. Bobby reads the letter but doesn&#x27;t reveal what it says and tells John Ross and Christopher that it is between J.R. and him for the time being. Bobby and Bum talk outside the office where Bobby tells Bum to pay off whoever he has to in order to make everyone believe that J.R. was killed by a mugger and when the time is right the Ewings will handle the situation as a family. Bobby goes to J.R.&#x27;s bedroom and drinks some of J.R.&#x27;s trademark bourbon. Bobby, imagining talking to J.R., says that he knew J.R. would have one final card to play and it was a good one. Bobby says he loves J.R. and he breaks down crying. Bobby, John Ross and Christopher continue working together on the plan and they realise how important it is to find Pam, because she owns one-third of Barnes Global shares along with Katherine and Cliff. With Katherine dead it only leaves her. It was said she entered Abu Dhabi with her husband in 1989. Bobby finally reveals that J.R&#x27;s master plan was to frame Cliff for his death &quot;from beyond the grave&quot;. He reveals that J.R., knowing that he only had days to live from terminal cancer, had Bum steal Cliff&#x27;s pistol. J.R. knew that Cliff went to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico every year for a fishing competition. J.R. had Bum meet him there and kill him. His plan was to have the Ewing family plant the pistol and J.R.&#x27;s trademark belt buckle in Cliff&#x27;s car and safety deposit box.

== Reunion movies ==
Two &quot;Dallas&quot; reunion TV movies were produced in the 1990s. Though these movies, at the time, continued the story of &quot; Dallas&quot;, they were later discarded for continuity purposes when the 2012 &quot;Dallas&quot; revival series was launched. In the first reunion movie, &quot;&quot; (1996), it was revealed that J.R. had shot the mirror in front of him and moved away to Europe for a few years. He returned and attempted to take back his empire, succeeding to an extent as he drove Cliff Barnes out of Ewing Oil, returning it to Bobby. J.R. was also elected chairman of West Star Oil, a feat he had spent almost fifteen years fighting to achieve. A second reunion movie, &quot;&quot; (1998), saw J.R. as CEO of West Star, try and fail to force a merger with Ewing Oil, but he did claim the consolation of conning $50 million from Carter McKay.

== Cars ==
J.R. initially drove a green 1978 Mercedes-Benz 280SE, later replaced by a 1979 Reseda Green Mercedes-Benz 450SEL. In 1981, he drove a redesigned W126 380SEL, also in Reseda Green. In 1983 when his wife Sue Ellen wrecked the car at the end of the Southfork driveway, J.R. replaced it with another 1983 Mercedes Benz 380SEL. In 1984, Mercedes-Benz changed the flagship S-Class model to the 500SEL, J.R. then replaced the 380 with one of these. At the beginning of the 1986 season, J.R. drove a facelifted W126 560SEL but soon after replaced it with a Cadillac Allanté convertible which he drove from 1987 to 1991. At the end of the regular series run in 1991, J.R. drove a Lincoln Mark VII. J.R.&#x27;s father, Jock, had driven an earlier generation Lincoln Mark V at the beginning of the series in 1978.

In &quot;J.R. Returns&quot;, J.R. drives the 500SEL yet again for the first portion of the film. However, this vehicle is totaled and replaced with an updated silver 1996 Mercedes-Benz W140 S420 sedan. In &quot;War of the Ewings&quot;, J.R. is driving a silver 1998 SL500 Roadster.

Each of J.R.&#x27;s vehicles had the personalized license plate &quot;EWING 3&quot;.

== Legacy ==
* In 1999 &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him number 11 on its &quot;50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&quot; list. In the updated 2013 list, he was number 1.
* &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine ranked him the 69th Greatest Villain of all time while &quot;Best Villains on TV: Top Ten&quot; of Yahoo! Voices picked him as No. 1.
* WWE professional wrestler John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, modeled his post-APA villainous persona after Ewing.

<doc id="1147005" wikidata="Q7702932" url="?curid=1147005" title="Ternary compound">
<text>In inorganic chemistry and materials chemistry, a ternary compound or ternary phase is a chemical compound containing three different elements. 

While some ternary compounds are molecular, &quot;e.g.&quot; chloroform (), more typically ternary phases refer to extended solids. The perovskites are a famous example.

Binary phases, with only two elements, have lower degrees of complexity than ternary phases. With four elements, quaternary phases are more complex.

The number of isomers of a ternary compound provide a distinction between inorganic and organic chemistry: &quot;In inorganic chemistry one or, at most, only a few compounds composed of any two or three elements were known, whereas in organic chemistry the situation was very different.&quot;

==Ternary crystalline compounds==

An example is sodium phosphate, . The sodium ion has a charge of 1+ and the phosphate ion has a charge of 3–. Therefore, three sodium ions are needed to balance the charge of one phosphate ion. Another example of a ternary compound is calcium carbonate, . In naming and writing the formulae for ternary compounds, rules are similar to binary compounds.

===Classifications of ternary crystals===
According to Rustum Roy and Olaf Müller, &quot;the chemistry of the entire mineral world informs us that &quot;chemical&quot; complexity can easily be accommodated within structural simplicity.&quot; The example of zircon is cited, where various metal atoms are replaced in the same crystal structure. &quot;The structural entity ... remains ternary in character and is able to accommodate an enormous range of chemical elements.&quot; The great variety of ternary compounds is therefore reduced to relatively few structures: &quot;By dealing with approximately ten ternary structural groupings we can cover the most important structures of science and technology specific to the non-metallics world. It is a remarkable instance of nature&#x27;s simplexity.&quot;

Letting A and B represent cations and X an anion, these ternary groupings are organized by stoichiometric types , , and . 

A ternary compound of type may be in the class of olivine, the spinel group, or phenakite. Examples include , β-, and .

One of type may be of the class of zircon, scheelite, barite or an ordered silicon dioxide derivative.

In the class of ternary compounds, there are the structures of perovskite (structure), calcium carbonate, pyroxenes, corundum and hexagonal types.

Other ternary compounds are described as crystals of types , , , , and .

===Ternary semiconductors===
A particular class of ternary compounds are the ternary semiconductors, particularly within the III-V semiconductor family. In this type of semiconductor, the ternary can be considered to be an alloy of the two binary endpoints. Varying the composition between the endpoints allows both the lattice constant and the energy bandgap to be adjusted to produce the properties desired, for example, in emitting light (for example, as a LED) or absorbing light (as a photodetector or a photovoltaic cell). An example would be the semiconductor indium gallium arsenide (), a material with band gap dependent on In/Ga ratio.

Important examples of ternary semiconductors can also be found in other semiconductor families, such as the II-VI family (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Mercury cadmium telluride, ), or the I-II-VI2 family, with examples such as .

==Organics==
In organic chemistry, the carbohydrates and carboxylic acids are ternary compounds with carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Other organic ternary compounds replace oxygen with another atom to form functional groups.

The multiplicity of ternary compounds based on {C, H, O} has been noted. For example, &lt;chem&gt;C9 H10 O3&lt;/chem&gt; corresponds to more than 60 ternary compounds.

<text>Michael Gerard Fitzpatrick (June 28, 1963 – January 6, 2020) was an American attorney and politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing from 2005 to 2007 and 2011 to 2017. He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and represented the district from 2005 to 2007, but he was defeated by Democrat Patrick Murphy in 2006.

He declined to run for his old seat in 2008 but ran again in 2010, and won a rematch with Murphy. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. A supporter of term limits, he did not seek re-election in 2016 and was replaced by his brother Brian. He was considered a moderate Republican, and consistently ranked among the most bipartisan members of Congress.

==Early life, education and law career==
Fitzpatrick was born in Philadelphia and raised in Bucks County. He graduated from Bishop Egan High School, now Conwell-Egan Catholic High School, in Fairless Hills. He moved to Florida to attend St. Thomas University with an academic scholarship where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1985 from the school&#x27;s honors program.

He earned his J.D. degree from the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State University. He was named business manager of the Dickinson Journal of International Law. After graduating law school in 1988, Fitzpatrick was admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

==Bucks County Commission (1995–2005)==
In January 1995, Fitzpatrick was appointed to the Bucks County Board of Commissioners by an 11-member panel of county judges. The appointment was made to fill the unexpired term of Mark Schweiker, who had been elected lieutenant governor.

Fitzpatrick, who was an attorney at a firm active in county affairs, was the candidate preferred by county Republican Party leaders.

The appointment was not without controversy, however, as some claimed the judges had acted solely on the recommendation of the county Republican Party.

As Commissioner, Fitzpatrick oversaw social agencies, coordinated the response of local governments to emergencies, preserved open space, and responded to regional issues. Fitzpatrick supported a $7 million information-technology project to upgrade the county&#x27;s communication and outreach abilities in light of the Information Age.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2005–2007)==

===Elections===
;2004
In July 2004, popular moderate Republican James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 8th congressional district unexpectedly withdrew from his re-election campaign. In the party convention held to select Greenwood&#x27;s replacement on the ballot, the more conservative Fitzpatrick won the nomination over Greenwood&#x27;s choice, state Senator Joe Conti, thanks to the backing of Bucks County Republican Party boss Harry Fawkes. Fitzpatrick went on to face liberal activist Virginia Schrader in the general election. Fitzpatrick won the general election against Schrader 55%–44%, with the remaining vote split between two minor candidates. The district included all of Bucks County, a sliver of Montgomery County, and parts of two wards in Northeast Philadelphia.

;2006

Fitzpatrick faced Democrat Patrick Murphy in the November general election of 2006. In January 2006, Fitzpatrick said he had donated to charity the $21,500 he received from political action committees headed by U.S. Representatives Bob Ney (R-OH), Tom DeLay, (R-TX), and Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham (R-CA).

Fitzpatrick was endorsed by several environmental groups including the Sierra Club. He was the only incumbent Republican congressman in Pennsylvania who had the support of the environmentalist lobby during this election. The &quot;Cook Political Report&quot; rated the race as &quot;Leans Republican&quot;. However, Congressional Quarterly pegged the contest as a &quot;Toss-up&quot;. A poll released at the end of October showed Fitzpatrick trailing Murphy by three percentage points.

In the end, the election was decided by less than one percentage point, with Fitzpatrick initially trailing by just over 1,500 votes out of nearly 250,000 cast. On November 8, with all precincts reporting, Murphy led by 1,521 votes. Philadelphia television station NBC 10 later reported that Fitzpatrick had conceded the election to Murphy. He along with Mike Sodrel (R-IN) and Joe Schwarz (R-MI) were the only freshman Republicans to be defeated in 2006 (Schwarz in the primary).

==Tenure==
In May 2006, Fitzpatrick introduced the Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006, which requires most schools and libraries to actively restrict minors from access to &quot;Commercial Social Networking Websites&quot; and &quot;Chat Rooms&quot;. In late July, the &quot;DOPA Act&quot; overwhelmingly passed the House. Speaking before the vote was taken, Fitzpatrick said, &quot;The social networking sites have become, in a sense, a happy hunting ground for child predators&quot;.

==Committee assignments==
Fitzpatrick served on the United States House Committee on Financial Services and the United States House Committee on Small Business.

==Inter-congressional career (2007–2011)==
After the loss to Murphy, Fitzpatrick re-entered the practice of law, taking a position with Middletown Township law firm—and major Republican Party contributor—Begley, Carlin, and Mandio.

In the fall of 2007, the Bucks County Commissioners asked Fitzpatrick, along with former Commissioner Andy Warren and former Common Pleas Judge William Hart Rufe to co-chair an effort to pass a ballot initiative authorizing the county to borrow $87 million for open space preservation. The initiative, which was also endorsed by Congressman Murphy, passed by a large margin.

;2008

Throughout 2007, there was much speculation that Fitzpatrick would seek to reclaim the seat in Congress that he lost to Murphy. Fitzpatrick laid the rumors to rest in January 2008 by announcing that he would not be running for Congress, but instead would challenge freshman State Representative Chris King in the 142nd District.

Despite charges by some Democrats that he was &quot;afraid to run against Murphy because he knows he would lose&quot;, Fitzpatrick claimed that he was interested in the job because of his &quot;passion ... in solving local problems and serving the local community&quot;, as well as a desire to &quot;change the way business is done in Harrisburg.&quot;

However, a cancer diagnosis forced Fitzpatrick to end his bid for the State House in early February. Fitzpatrick yielded his spot on the ballot to Republican activist Frank Farry (who went on to win the seat), and supported Doylestown pharmaceutical company executive Thomas Manion for the congressional seat he once held.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2011–2017)==

===Elections===
;2010

On January 23, 2010, Fitzpatrick announced he would once again run for his old seat in the House of Representatives. He pledged that if elected, he would only serve for a maximum of three more terms, for a total of four terms. He described Washington, D.C. as &quot;a town of embedded politicians&quot; with a seniority system that &quot;rewards congressmen for political careers lasting decades and encourages members to serve in perpetuity.&quot; He called for &quot;real reform of house rules and procedures&quot; and &quot;congressional term limits.&quot;

He won the Republican nomination with 77% of the vote in the May primary. A Franklin and Marshall poll taken in mid-September 2010 suggested the race was leaning towards Fitzpatrick at that time.

On November 2, Fitzpatrick defeated Murphy and was elected the Congressman for the 8th district. On November 2, 2010, Fitzpatrick defeated Murphy by 53.5% to 46.5% to reclaim his old seat. He was sworn in on January 5, 2011, and has joined the Republican Main Street Partnership.

;2012

Fitzpatrick defeated Kathryn Boockvar 57%–43%.

;2014

Before the election, Fitzpatrick reiterated a pledge he made in 2010 that this will be his last re-election bid, due to self-imposed term limits. In the Democratic primary, former Army Ranger Kevin Strouse defeated businesswoman Shaughnessy Naughton. Fitzpatrick defeated Strouse in the general election. After he won, he again confirmed that he would not run for re-election in 2016.

Fitzpatrick&#x27;s younger brother, Brian, a lawyer and former FBI supervisory special agent in California, moved back to Pennsylvania to run for his brother&#x27;s seat. Brian Fitzpatrick won the election on November 8, 2016.

==Tenure==
On January 5, 2011, Fitzpatrick failed to attend the swearing-in ceremony for members and attempted to take the oath-of-office remotely at a reception. However, House rules require that the oath be taken within proximity of the Speaker. The oath was administered the following day, but two votes that he cast prior to taking the oath were nullified according to the Constitution.

Some activists contended the reception was a fundraiser and called for an investigation by the House Ethics Committee.

A spokesperson for Fitzpatrick denied the event was a fundraiser and asserted that donations made went to cover the cost of campaign-provided buses to Washington.

Fitzpatrick supported reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

On January 5, 2016, the House Committee on Financial Services reauthorized the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing with Fitzpatrick as Chairman and Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA) as Ranking Member.

Over the course of a two-year period, the Task Force investigated the financial mechanisms used to fund terrorist activities, specifically the vulnerabilities of the global financial system, trade-based money laundering, assistance for developing world, and the sale and trafficking of illicit goods.

Since December 2014, Fitzpatrick has been a leading voice in Congress on medical device safety. He has pressed the FDA after dangerous medical devices remained in use after causing serious injury and death.

On June 8, 2016, Fitzpatrick and Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) introduced two bills to reform the medical device review and approval process. The first bill, Ariel Grace&#x27;s Law, would allow victims of dangerous medical devices to seek legal recourse. The second bill, the Medical Device Guardians Act, would require physicians to identify and report unsafe medical devices and would protect them from having their reports used against them in a civil court.

Fitzpatrick was ranked as the 10th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises
** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Vice Chair)
** Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing (Chair)

==Personal life and death==
Fitzpatrick and his wife Kathleen, a high school science teacher, lived in Levittown, Pennsylvania, with their six children.

He was affiliated with the Washington Crossing Council of the Boy Scouts of America and was a member of the Temple Lower Bucks Hospital Board of Directors, the Conwell-Egan Catholic Board of Advisors, the Knights of Columbus, the Levittown Bristol Kiwanis Club, the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Brehon Law Society. He was an Eagle Scout from the Bucks County Council and former president of that council, and was honored with the Silver Beaver Award for his services to Scouting.

Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with colon cancer in June 2008. He reported five months later that the cancer went into remission after chemotherapy.

Fitzpatrick died from melanoma at his home in Levittown on January 6, 2020, at age 56.

<text>The Buddhabrot is the probability distribution over the trajectories of points that escape the Mandelbrot fractal. Its name reflects its pareidolic resemblance to classical depictions of Gautama Buddha, seated in a meditation pose with a forehead mark (&quot;tika&quot;), a traditional oval crown (&quot;ushnisha&quot;), and ringlet of hair.

==Discovery==

The &quot;Buddhabrot&quot; rendering technique was discovered by Melinda Green, who later described it in a 1993 Usenet post to sci.fractals.

Previous researchers had come very close to finding the precise Buddhabrot technique. In 1988, Linas Vepstas relayed similar images to Cliff Pickover for inclusion in Pickover&#x27;s then-forthcoming book &quot;Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty&quot;. This led directly to the discovery of Pickover stalks. Noel Griffin also implemented this idea in the 1993 &quot;Mandelcloud&quot; option in the Fractint renderer. However, these researchers did not filter out non-escaping trajectories required to produce the ghostly forms reminiscent of Hindu art. The inverse, &quot;Anti-Buddhabrot&quot; filter produces images similar to no filtering.

Green first named this pattern Ganesh, since an Indian co-worker &quot;instantly recognized it as the god &#x27;Ganesha&#x27; which is the one with the head of an elephant.&quot; The name &quot;Buddhabrot&quot; was coined later by Lori Gardi.

==Rendering method==

Mathematically, the Mandelbrot set consists of the set of points formula_1 in the complex plane for which the iteratively defined sequence

formula_2

does tend to infinity as formula_3 goes to infinity for formula_4.

The &quot;Buddhabrot&quot; image can be constructed by first creating a 2-dimensional array of boxes, each corresponding to a final pixel in the image. Each box formula_5 for formula_6 and formula_7 has size in complex coordinates of formula_8 and formula_9, where formula_10 and formula_11 for an image of width formula_12 and height formula_13. For each box, a corresponding counter is initialized to zero. Next, a random sampling of formula_1 points are iterated through the Mandelbrot function. For points which escape within a chosen maximum number of iterations, and therefore are &quot;not&quot; in the Mandelbrot set, the counter for each box entered during the escape to infinity is incremented by 1. In other words, for each sequence corresponding to formula_1 that escapes, for each point formula_16 during the escape, the box that formula_17 lies within is incremented by 1. Points which do not escape within the maximum number of iterations (and considered to be in the Mandelbrot set) are discarded. After a large number of formula_1 values have been iterated, grayscale shades are then chosen based on the distribution of values recorded in the array. The result is a density plot highlighting regions where formula_16 values spend the most time on their way to infinity.

==Nuances==
Rendering &quot;Buddhabrot&quot; images is typically more computationally intensive than standard Mandelbrot rendering techniques. This is partly due to requiring more random points to be iterated than pixels in the image in order to build up a sharp image. Rendering highly zoomed areas requires even more computation than for standard Mandelbrot images in which a given pixel can be computed directly regardless of zoom level. Conversely, a pixel in a zoomed region of a Buddhabrot image can be affected by initial points from regions far outside the one being rendered. Without resorting to more complex probabilistic techniques, rendering zoomed portions of &quot;Buddhabrot&quot; consists of merely cropping a large full sized rendering.

The maximum number of iterations chosen affects the image – higher values give sparser more detailed appearance, as a few of the points pass through a large number of pixels before they escape, resulting in their paths being more prominent. If a lower maximum was used, these points would not escape in time and would be regarded as not escaping at all. The number of samples chosen also affects the image as not only do higher sample counts reduce the noise of the image, they can reduce the visibility of slowly moving points and small attractors, which can show up as visible streaks in a rendering of lower sample count. Some of these streaks are visible in the 1,000,000 iteration image below.

Green later realized that this provided a natural way to create color Buddhabrot images by taking three such grayscale images, differing only by the maximum number of iterations used, and combining them into a single color image using the same method used by astronomers to create false color images of nebula and other celestial objects. For example, one could assign a 2,000 max iteration image to the red channel, a 200 max iteration image to the green channel, and a 20 max iteration image to the blue channel of an image in an RGB color space. Some have labelled Buddhabrot images using this technique &quot;Nebulabrots&quot;.

==Relation to the logistic map==

The relationship between the Mandelbrot set as defined by the iteration formula_20, and the logistic map formula_21 is well known. The two are related by the quadratic transformation:

formula_22

The traditional way of illustrating this relationship is aligning the logistic map and the Mandelbrot set through the relation between formula_23 and formula_24, using a common x-axis and a different y-axis, showing a one-dimensional relationship.

Melinda Green discovered that the Anti-Buddhabrot paradigm fully integrates the logistic map. Both are based on tracing paths from non-escaping points, iterated from a (random) starting point, and the iteration functions are related by the transformation given above. It is then easy to see that the Anti-Buddhabrot for formula_20, plotting paths with formula_26 and formula_27, simply generates the logistic map in the plane formula_28, when using the given transformation. For rendering purposes we use formula_29. In the logistic map, all formula_30 ultimately generate the same path.

Because both the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map are an integral part of the Anti-Buddhabrot we can now show a 3D relationship between both, using the 3D axes
formula_31. The animation shows the classic Anti-Buddhabrot with formula_32 and formula_27, this is the 2D Mandelbrot set in the plane
formula_34, and also the Anti-Buddhabrot with formula_26 and formula_27, this is the 2D logistic map in the plane formula_28. We rotate the plane formula_38 around the formula_23-axis, first showing formula_34, then rotating 90° to show formula_28, then rotating an extra 90° to show formula_42. We could rotate an extra 180° but this gives the same images, mirrored around the formula_23-axis.

The logistic map Anti-Buddhabrot is in fact a subset of the classic Anti-Buddhabrot, situated in the plane formula_28 (or formula_45) of 3D formula_31, perpendicular to the plane formula_34. We emphasize this by showing briefly, at 90° rotation, only the projected plane formula_45, not &#x27;disturbed&#x27; by the projections of the planes with non-zero formula_49.

<text>The Anglo-Mysore Wars were a series of four wars fought during the last three decades of the 18th century between the Sultanate of Mysore on the one hand, and the British East India Company (represented chiefly by the neighbouring Madras Presidency), Maratha Empire, Kingdom of Travancore, and the Kingdom of Hyderabad on the other. Hyder Ali and his succeeding son Tipu fought the wars on four fronts: with the British attacking from the west, south and east and the Nizam&#x27;s forces attacking from the north. The fourth war resulted in the overthrow of the house of Hyder Ali and Tipu (the latter was killed in the fourth war, in 1799), and the dismantlement of Mysore to the benefit of the East India Company, which took control of much of the Indian subcontinent.

== The four wars ==
=== First Anglo-Mysore War ===

In the First Anglo-Mysore War (1767 – 1769), Hyder Ali enjoyed some measure of success against the British, almost capturing Madras. The British convinced Nizam Mir Nizam Ali Khan to attack Ali. That was temporary, however, and the Nizam signed a new treaty with the British in February 1768. Ali had to contend with a British Bombay army attacking from the west and a Madras army attacking from the northeast. However, Ali&#x27;s attack towards Madras resulted in the Madras government suing for peace, and the resultant Treaty of Madras.

=== Second Anglo-Mysore War ===

The Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780 – 1784) witnessed bloodier battles with fortunes fluctuating between the contesting powers. Ali defeated William Baillie at the Battle of Pollilur in September 1780, and John Braithwaite at Kumbakonam in February 1782, both of whom were taken prisoner to Srirangapatana. This war saw the comeback of Sir Eyre Coote, the British commander who defeated Ali at the Battle of Porto Novo and Arni. Tipu continued the war following his father&#x27;s death. Finally, the war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mangalore on 11 March 1784, which restored the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. The Treaty of Gajendraghad in April 1787 ended the conflict with the Marathas. Warren Hastings (1772-1785) was Governor-General of India during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. 

=== Third Anglo-Mysore War ===

In the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790 – 1792), Tipu Sultan, now an ally of France, invaded the nearby Kingdom of Travancore, a British ally, in 1789. The British forces were commanded by Charles Cornwallis. The resulting war lasted three years and was a nearly defeat for Mysore. The war ended after the 1792 siege of Srirangapatana and the signing of the Treaty of Srirangapatana, according to which Tipu Sultan had to surrender some part of his kingdom to the British East India Company and its allies.

=== Fourth Anglo-Mysore war ===

The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798 – 1799) saw the death of Tipu Sultan and further reductions in Mysorean territory. Mysore&#x27;s alliance with the French was seen as a threat to the East India Company, and Mysore was attacked from all four sides. Mysore had 35,000 soldiers, whereas the British commanded 60,000 troops. Nizam Akbar Ali Khan and the traitor Marathas launched an invasion from the north. The British won a decisive victory at the siege of Seringapatam (1799). Tipu Sultan was killed during the defence of the city. Much of the remaining Mysorean territory was annexed by the British, the traitor Nizam, and the traitor Marathas. The remaining core, around Mysore and Seringapatam, was restored to the Indian prince Yuvaraja Krishnaraja Wadiyar III (later Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar III) under his grandmother&#x27;s regency. Members of the Wodeyar dynasty had been in power before Ali became the de facto ruler. The Wodeyars ruled the remnant Kingdom of Mysore until 1947, when it joined the Dominion of India.

=== Aftermath ===
After the Battles of Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764), which established British dominion over East India, the Anglo-Mysore Wars (1767 – 1799), the Anglo–Maratha Wars (1775-1819), and finally the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849), consolidated the British claim over South Asia, resulting in the British Empire in India, though resistance among various groups such as the Afghans and the Burmese would last well into the 1880s.

== Rockets ==

The Mysorean rockets used by Tipu during the Battle of Pollilur were much more advanced than any that the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant. This enabled higher thrust and a longer range for the missile (up to ). After Tipu&#x27;s eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of a number of Mysorean iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.

<doc id="1147030" wikidata="Q230906" url="?curid=1147030" title="Marie of Brabant, Queen of France">
<text>Marie of Brabant (13 May 1254 – 12 January 1322) was Queen of France from 1274 until 1285 as the second wife of King Philip III. Born in Leuven, Brabant, she was a daughter of Henry III, Duke of Brabant, and Adelaide of Burgundy.

== Queen ==

Marie married the widowed Philip III of France on 21 August 1274. His first wife, Isabella of Aragon, had already given birth to three surviving sons: Louis, Philip and Charles.

Philip was under the strong influence of his mother, Margaret of Provence, and his minion, surgeon and chamberlain (Chambellan) Pierre de la Broce. Not being French, Marie stood out at the French court. In 1276, Marie&#x27;s stepson Louis died under suspicious circumstances. Marie was suspected of ordering him to be poisoned. La Broce, who was also suspected, was imprisoned and later executed for the murder.

== Queen dowager ==

After the death of Philip III in 1285, Marie lost some of her political influence, and dedicated her life to their three children: Louis (May 1276 – 19 May 1319), Blanche (1278 – 19 March 1305) and Margaret (died in 1318). Her stepson Philip IV was crowned king of France on 6 January 1286 in Reims.

Together with Joan I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois, she negotiated peace in 1294 between England and France with Edmund Crouchback, the younger brother of Edward I of England.

Marie lived through Philip IV&#x27;s reign and she outlived her children. She died in 1322, aged 67, in the monastery at Les Mureaux, near Meulan, where she had withdrawn to in 1316. Marie was not buried in the royal necropolis of Basilica of Saint-Denis, but in the Cordeliers Convent, in Paris. Destroyed in a fire in 1580, the church was rebuilt in the following years.

<doc id="1147032" wikidata="Q5287597" url="?curid=1147032" title="Doctrine of equivalents">
<text>The doctrine of equivalents is a legal rule in many (but not all) of the world&#x27;s patent systems that allows a court to hold a party liable for patent infringement if the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope of a patent claim but is nevertheless equivalent to the claimed invention. In the United States, Judge Learned Hand has described its purpose as being &quot;to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention.&quot;

==Standards for determining equivalents==
=== Germany ===
German courts typically apply a three-step test known as Schneidmesser&#x27;s questions:
#Does the variant solve the problem underlying the invention with means that objectively have the same effect?
#Would the person skilled in the art, using the common general knowledge, have realised at the priority date that the variant has the same effect?
#Are the considerations which the skilled person takes into account for the variant in the light of the meaning of the invention close enough to the considerations taken into account for the literal solution protected by the claims, such that the skilled person will consider the variant as a solution which is equivalent to the literal one?

All of the above questions need to be answered in the affirmative in order to demonstrate equivalent infringement. In addition, an allegation of equivalent infringement needs to withstand the Formstein test. The corresponding question reads:
:Does the variant, having regard to the state of the art, lack novelty or is the variant obvious to a person skilled in the art?

=== Ireland ===
Ireland appears to subscribe to a doctrine of equivalents. In &quot;Farbwerke Hoechst v Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals (Eire) Ltd&quot; (1968), a case involving a patent of a chemical process, the High Court found that the defendant had infringed the plaintiff&#x27;s patent despite the fact that the defendant had substituted the starting material specified in the patent claim for another material. Expert evidence showed that any technician who failed to obtain a good result using the specified starting material would try the replacement material. The two materials were therefore held to be chemically equivalent, and the replacement of one with the other by the defendant did not prevent a finding and injunction against him.

=== Switzerland ===
On 21 March 2013, the Federal Patent Court of Switzerland adopted an approach similar to the three-prong test applied in Germany. The court based its decision on the three questions:
#Do the replaced features have the same objective function (same effect)? 
#Are the replaced features and their same objective function obvious to a person skilled in the art on the basis of the teaching of the patent (accessibility)? 
#After reading the wording of the claim in light of the description, would a person skilled in the art consider the replaced features as a solution of equal value (equal value)?

The court denied equivalent infringement of EP0918791B3, since paragraph 19 of EP0918791B3 explicitly teaches that toxic chromium compounds may be replaced by metallic catalysts. A person skilled in the art would not consider the organic catalyst TEMPO as a solution of equal value to the ruthenium salts specified in claim 1. The answer to the third question was negative.

The court also ruled that there was equivalent infringement of EP1149840B1, since all questions of the three-prong test were answered in the affirmative. The court set forth that the replacement of the claimed p-Toluenesulfonic acid with pyridine/water constituted basic knowledge taught during the first years of an undergraduate course in organic chemistry.

In &quot;Urinal valve II&quot;, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland basically affirmed the three-prong test applied by the Federal Patent Court. The Supreme Court still partly reversed the Federal Patent Court’s earlier ruling on case O2014_002. The Supreme Court contended (reasons 6.4) that a second embodiment of the urinal valve fully implemented the key teachings of the asserted patent EP1579133, even though the second embodiment was not literally covered by the wording of the relevant claim. The Court went on to establish equivalent infringement.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK approach to infringement that does not fall within the literal wording of a patent claim has varied over the years.

====History====
Until the 1960s, an act could be considered infringing if it either fell within the literal wording of the claim (“textual infringement”) or was something that the courts considered to be a &quot;mechanical equivalent.&quot; That wording was found to cause problems in some cases, and gradually the courts built up a complex body of case law whereby an act that was not a textual infringement could nevertheless be caught if the alleged infringer had taken what the courts came to call the &quot;pith and marrow&quot; of the invention.

In 1963, &quot;Van der Lely v Bamfords&quot; was decided by the House of Lords. Their Lordships took the view that if the patentees had deliberately framed their claim in such way as to exclude the alleged infringing act, then they should be held to the wording they had chosen. The &quot;pith and marrow&quot; doctrine should not be applied so as to extend the scope of a carefully-worded claim and should in the future apply only to cases of &quot;colourable evasion of patent claims.&quot;

The much stricter approach to claim construction became open to review after 1977, when the UK joined the European Patent Convention (EPC). Under the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69, the Convention required the UK courts to maintain a balance between interpreting patent claims with strict literalism (the description and drawings being used only to resolve ambiguity) and regarding the claims as a mere guideline.

In &quot;Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd&quot; (1982) the House of Lords swept away all of the earlier case law on &quot;mechanical equivalents” and &quot;pith and marrow&quot;, and held that a patent specification should be given a “purposive construction” rather than a purely literal one. The question to be asked should be whether a skilled person reading the patent would understand that strict compliance with a word or phrase within the claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement, even if it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.

The specific questions used by the courts to achieve the required “purposive construction” settled into stable form with &quot;Improver v Remington&quot; (1990) and the House of Lords decision in &quot;Kirin-Amgen&quot; (2004). These so-called Improver (or Protocol) questions became a widely used three-step test for determining non-literal patent infringement.

====Current law====

In 2007 the EPC was revised as EPC 2000. This amended the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 to require the courts of all contracting states, including the UK, to take due account when considering infringement &quot;of any element which is an equivalent to an element specified in the claims&quot;.

In 2017, Lord Neuberger in &quot;Actavis UK v Eli Lilly&quot; held that the Protocol questions should be revised. The correct questions to ask when determining whether there has been non-literal infringement, according to the Supreme Court, should now be
# &quot;Notwithstanding that it is not within the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent, does the variant achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same way as the invention, ie the inventive concept revealed by the patent?&quot;
# &quot;Would it be obvious to the person skilled in the art, reading the patent at the priority date, but knowing that the variant achieves substantially the same result as the invention, that it does so in substantially the same way as the invention?&quot;
# &quot;Would such a reader of the patent have concluded that the patentee nonetheless intended that strict compliance with the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent was an essential requirement of the invention?&quot;

In order to establish infringement in a case where there is no literal infringement, a patentee must establish that the answer to the first two questions is “yes” and that the answer to the third is “no”.

=== United States ===
The United States also has both statutory equivalents doctrine that is codified in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6, which extends to equivalents available at patent&#x27;s issuance, and a more general (non-statutory, created by courts) doctrine of equivalents, which extends to technological equivalents developed after the patent is granted. Notably, the doctrine of equivalence can be applied even to means-plus-function claims. The proposed equivalents also cannot cover, or ensnare, the prior art.

In American practice, the doctrine of equivalents analysis is applied to individual claim limitations, not to the invention as a whole. The legal test, articulated in &quot;Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.&quot; (1997), is whether the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim is &quot;insubstantial.&quot;

One way of determining whether a difference is &quot;insubstantial&quot; or not is called the &quot;triple identity&quot; test. Under the triple-identity test, the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim may be found to be &quot;insubstantial&quot; if the feature in the accused device:
#Performs substantially the same function
#In substantially the same way
#To obtain the same result
as the limitation literally recited in the patent claim. See &quot;Graver Tank &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.&quot;, (1950).

The Court also explained that the doctrine of equivalents applies if two elements are interchangeable and a person with ordinary skill in the art would have known that the elements were interchangeable at the time of infringement.

In the United States, the doctrine of equivalents is limited by prosecution history estoppel. Under prosecution history estoppel, if the patentee abandoned through an amendment to the patent application certain literal claim coverage (e.g., by narrowing the literal scope of the patent claim), then the patentee is estopped from later arguing that the surrendered coverage is insubstantially different from the literally claimed limitation. Also, based on the public dedication principle, a patentee may not invoke the doctrine of equivalents to recapture subject matter disclosed but not claimed in a patent.

== Harmonization attempts ==
Attempts have been made to harmonize the doctrine of equivalents.

For instance, Article 21(2) of 1991 WIPO&#x27;s &quot;Basic Proposal&quot; for a Treaty Supplementing the Paris Convention states:
:&quot;(a) (...) a claim shall be considered to cover not only all the elements as expressed in the claim but also equivalents.
:(b) An element (&quot;the equivalent element&quot;) shall generally be considered as being equivalent to an element as expressed in a claim if, at the time of any alleged infringement, either of the following conditions is fulfilled in regard to the invention as claimed:
::(i) the equivalent element performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way and produces substantially the same result as the element as expressed in the claim, or
::(ii) it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the same result as that achieved by means of the element as expressed in the claim can be achieved by means of the equivalent element.&quot;

The EPC 2000, which came into effect on 13 December 2007, included an amended &quot;Protocol on the interpretation of &quot; intended to bring about uniformity at a national level between contracting states to the EPC when interpreting claims. The amended text reads:
:&quot;For the purpose of determining the extent of protection conferred by a European patent, due account shall be taken of any element which is an equivalent to an element specified in the claims.&quot;
However, no definition of what was meant by an &quot;equivalent&quot; was included in the Protocol and it is expected that this lack of a binding definition will do little to achieve the desired uniform interpretation.

<doc id="1147034" wikidata="Q2379380" url="?curid=1147034" title="Evacuation of East Prussia">
<text>German civilian population and military personnel were evacuated from East Prussia between 20 January and March 1945. The evacuation was initially organized and carried out by state authorities but quickly turned into a chaotic flight from the Red Army.

A part of the evacuation of German civilians towards the end of World War II, these events are not to be confused with the expulsion from East Prussia that followed after the war had ended. The area that was evacuated was not the Gau East Prussia, but the inter-war East Prussia where most people already held German citizenship. German citizens in Memel and other regions with proximity to East Prussia also took part in the evacuation, wishing to escape by sea, even though in their regions there was no official evacuation announced.

The evacuation, which had been delayed for months, was initiated due to fear of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a military necessity, Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both spurious and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors that swept through the military and civilian populations.

Despite having detailed evacuation plans for some areas, the German authorities, including the Gauleiter of East Prussia, Erich Koch, delayed action until 20 January, when it was too late for an orderly evacuation, and the civil services and Nazi Party were eventually overwhelmed by the numbers of those wishing to evacuate. Coupled with the panic caused by the speed of the Soviet advance, civilians caught in the middle of combat, and the bitter winter weather, many thousands of refugees died during the evacuation period. The Soviet forces took control of East Prussia only in May 1945. According to the West German Schieder commission, the civilian population of East Prussia at the beginning of 1944 was 2,653,000 people. This accounting, which was based on ration cards, included air raid evacuees from western Germany and foreign workers. Before the end of the war an estimated 2 million people were evacuated, including 500,000 in late 1944 and 1,500,000 after January 1945. An estimated 600,000 remained behind in Soviet-controlled East Prussia in April–May 1945.

According to a 1974 West German government study, an estimated 1% of the civilian population was killed during the Soviet offensive. The West German search service reported that 31,940 civilians from East Prussia, which also included Memel, were confirmed as killed during the evacuation.

==Propaganda==

===German===

The Red Army initiated an offensive into East Prussia in October 1944, but it was temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the German Ministry of Propaganda reported that war crimes had taken place in East Prussian villages, in particular in Nemmersdorf, where inhabitants had been raped and killed by the advancing Soviets. Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document what had happened, and invited foreign observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of bolstering civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets. A Nazi information campaign about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as other crimes committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.

===Soviet===
Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from cases at Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved &quot;Ostarbeiter&quot; (&quot;Eastern workers&quot;) were freed, and knowledge of the suffering and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.

Lev Kopelev, who took part in the invasion of East Prussia, sharply criticized atrocities against the German civilian population. For this he was arrested in 1945 and sentenced to a ten-year term in the Gulag for &quot;bourgeois humanism&quot; and for &quot;pity for the enemy&quot;. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn also served in East Prussia in 1945 and was arrested for criticizing Joseph Stalin and Soviet crimes in private correspondence with a friend. Solzhenitsyn was sentenced to an eight-year term in a labor camp. Of the atrocities, Solzhenitsyn wrote: &quot;You know very well that we&#x27;ve come to Germany to take our revenge&quot; for German atrocities committed in the Soviet Union.

The evacuation plans for parts of East Prussia were ready in the second half of 1944. They consisted of both general plans and specific instructions for many towns. The plans encompassed not only civilians, but also industry and livestock.

Initially, Erich Koch, the Gauleiter of East Prussia, forbade evacuation of civilians (until 20 January 1945), and ordered that civilians trying to flee the region without permission should be instantly shot. Any kind of preparations made by civilians were treated as defeatism and &quot;Wehrkraftzersetzung&quot; (undermining of military morale). Koch and many other Nazi functionaries were among the first to flee during the Soviet advance. Between 12 January and mid-February 1945, almost 8.5 million Germans fled the Eastern provinces of the Reich. Most of the refugees were women and children heading to western parts of Germany, carrying goods on improvised means of transport, such as wooden wagons and carts, as all the motorized vehicles and fuel had been confiscated by the Wehrmacht at the beginning of the war. After the Red Army reached the coast of the Vistula Lagoon near Elbing on 23 January 1945, cutting off the overland route between East Prussia and the western territories, the only way to leave was to cross the frozen Vistula Lagoon to reach the harbours of Danzig or Gotenhafen to be evacuated by ships taking part in Operation Hannibal. Mingled with retreating Wehrmacht units, and without any camouflage or shelter, the refugees were attacked by Soviet bombers and fighter aircraft. Many wagons broke through the bomb-riddled ice covering the brackish water. Horses and caretakers from the Trakehner stud farms were evacuated with the wagon trains. The evacuation was severely hampered by Wehrmacht units, which clogged roads and bridges.

The remaining men aged 16–60 were immediately incorporated into the Volkssturm, but some Volkssturm members, without basic military knowledge and training, escaped into the woods, hoping to survive. Refugee trains leaving East Prussia were also extremely crowded, and due to the very low temperatures, children often froze to death during the journey. The last refugee train left Königsberg on 22 January 1945.

Berlin military writer Antony Beevor wrote, in &quot;Berlin: The Downfall&quot; (2002), that:

===Operation Hannibal===

Operation Hannibal was a military operation that started on 21 January 1945, on the orders of Admiral Karl Dönitz, withdrawing German troops and civilians from Courland, East Prussia, and the Polish Corridor. The flood of refugees turned the operation into one of the largest emergency evacuations by sea in history – over a period of 15 weeks, somewhere between 494 and 1,080 merchant vessels of all types and numerous naval craft, including Germany&#x27;s largest remaining naval units, transported about 800,000–900,000 refugees and 350,000 soldiers across the Baltic Sea to Germany and occupied Denmark. This evacuation was one of the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s most significant activities during the war.

The greatest recorded loss of life from a ship sinking occurred during this operation, when the transport ship &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was hit by three torpedoes from the Soviet submarine S-13 in the Baltic Sea on the night of 30 January 1945. She sank in under 45 minutes; figures for the number of deaths vary from 5,348, to 7,000 or 9,400. The 949 survivors were rescued by Kriegsmarine vessels led by the cruiser &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, although it is claimed that &quot;the big warship could not risk heaving to, with a submarine close by&quot;. Also, on 10 February, the SS &quot;General von Steuben&quot; left Pillau with 2,680 refugees on board; it was hit by torpedoes just after departure, killing almost all aboard.

==Königsberg==

On 24 January 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front, led by General Chernyakhovsky, surrounded the capital city of East Prussia, Königsberg. The 3rd Panzer Army and around 200,000 civilians were trapped inside the city. In response to this, General Georg-Hans Reinhardt, commander of the Army Group Center, warned Hitler of the imminent Soviet threat, but the Führer refused to act. Due to the rapid approach of the 2nd Belorussian Front led by General Rokossovsky, Nazi authorities in Königsberg decided to send trains full of refugees to Allenstein, without knowing that the town had already been captured by the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps.

During the Soviet assault, the Frische Nehrung spit became the last means of escape to the west. However, civilians who tried to escape along the spit were often intercepted and killed by Soviet tanks and patrols. Two thousand civilians left Königsberg every day and tried to reach the already crowded town of Pillau. The final Soviet assault on Königsberg started on 2 April with a heavy bombardment of the city. The land route to Pillau was once again severed and those civilians who were still in the city died by the thousands. Eventually, the German garrison surrendered on 9 April, and as Beevor wrote, &quot;the rape of women and girls went unchecked in the ruined city&quot;.

==Crimes==

The widely publicized killings and rapes in places like Nemmersdorf by the Soviets led to a severe degree of fear in the entire German population of East Prussia. Those that could not escape the advancing Soviets were left to their fate. Wealthy civilians of East Prussia were often shot by Soviet soldiers, their goods stolen, and their houses set on fire. Zakhar Agranenko, a playwright serving as an officer of marine infantry in East Prussia, wrote:

Red Army soldiers don&#x27;t believe in &quot;individual liaisons&quot; with German women. Nine, ten, twelve men at a time – they rape them on a collective basis.

Even Russian women liberated from forced labor camps were raped by Soviet soldiers. The rear-guard units of the advancing Soviet armies were responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed by Red Army personnel. Soviet officers like Lev Kopelev, who tried to prevent crimes, were accused of pity for the enemy and became Gulag prisoners.

These acts of violence were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected the will of the political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia was the result of the Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union&#x27;s interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.

==Aftermath==

The Red Army eliminated all pockets of resistance and took control of East Prussia in May 1945. The exact number of civilian dead has never been determined, but is estimated to be at least 300,000. However, most of the German inhabitants, which at that point consisted mainly of children, women, and old men, did escape the Red Army as part of the largest exodus of people in human history. Antony Beevor said:

A population which had stood at 2.2 million in 1940 was reduced to 193,000 at the end of May 1945.

The Schieder commission in 1953 estimated casualties in the 1945 campaign at 30,000 civilian dead in East Prussia, and overall civilian losses in the entire Oder–Neisse region at 75–100,000.

The West German Statistisches Bundesamt figures from 1958 estimated total civilian losses in East Prussia of 299,200 including 274,200 in the expulsions after May 1945 and 25,000 during the war. According to the Statistisches Bundesamt, in total, out of a pre-war population of 2,490,000, about 500,000 died during the war, including 210,000 military dead and 311,000 civilians dying during the wartime flight, postwar expulsion of Germans and forced labor in the Soviet Union; 1,200,000 managed to escape to the western parts of Germany, while about 800,000 pre-war inhabitants remained in East Prussia in summer 1945. The figure of 311,000 civilian deaths is included in the overall estimate of 2.2 million expulsion deaths that is often cited in historical literature.

The West German search service issued its final report in 1965 detailing the losses of the German civilian population due to the flight and expulsions. The West German government authorized its release in 1986, and a summary of the findings was published in 1987 by the German scholar :de:Gert von Pistohlkors. According to the West German search service, the civilian population of East Prussia (including Memel) before the flight and expulsions was 2,328,947. They put civilian dead and missing at 514,176 persons. The number of confirmed dead was 123,360 (9,434 violent deaths, 736 suicides, 9,864 deportation deaths, 7,841 in internment camps, 31,940 deaths during the wartime flight, 22,308 during the expulsions and 41,237 from unknown causes). There were an additional 390,816 cases of persons reported missing whose fate could not be clarified. Some historians in Germany maintain that the search service figures of confirmed dead provide a realistic view of the total losses due to the flight and expulsions; they believe that the cases of persons reported missing whose fate could not be clarified are unreliable. The German historian Rüdiger Overmans maintains that the statistical foundations of the West German government search service report to be unreliable; he believes that new research on the number of expulsion deaths is needed. However, the German government and the German Red Cross still maintain that the higher figures which include the persons reported missing whose fate could not be clarified are correct.

The German Federal Archives estimated that about 1% (100–120,000 of the estimated 11–12 million total German civilian population) in the Oder–Neisse region lost their lives due to military activity in the 1944–45 campaign as well as deliberate killings by Soviet forces.

According to other sources, in summer 1945 about 800,000 Germans were still living in East Prussia. The Red Army&#x27;s brutality towards civilians during the East Prussian campaign, coupled with years of Nazi propaganda regarding the Soviet Union, led many German soldiers on the Eastern Front to believe that &quot;there could be no purpose in surviving Soviet victory&quot;. This belief motivated many German soldiers to continue fighting even though they believed that the war was lost, and this contributed to higher Soviet casualties.

Most Germans who were not evacuated during the war were expelled from East Prussia and the other former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line in the years immediately after the end of World War II, as agreed to by the Allies at the Potsdam conference, because, in the words of Winston Churchill:

After World War II, as also agreed at the Potsdam Conference (which met from 17 July until 2 August 1945), all of the area east of the Oder-Neisse line, whether recognized by the international community as part of Germany before 1933 or occupied by Germany during World War II, was placed under the jurisdiction of other countries. The relevant paragraph regarding East Prussia in the Potsdam Agreement is:

<doc id="1147039" wikidata="Q1781084" url="?curid=1147039" title="Koman languages">
<text>The Koman languages are a small, close-knit family of languages located along the Ethiopia–Sudan border with about 50,000 speakers. They are conventionally classified as part of the Nilo-Saharan family. However, due to the paucity of evidence, many scholars treat it as an independent language family. Among scholars who do accept its inclusion within Nilo-Saharan, opinions vary as to their position within it.

Koman languages in Ethiopia are in close contact with the Omotic Mao languages. In Ethiopia, some Koman-speaking groups also consider themselves to be ethnically Mao.

==Internal classification==
The Koman languages are:
*Koman
** Uduk, or T’wampa, (formerly in South Sudan) — about 20,000 speakers, most at a large refugee camp at Bonga, near Gambela
** Kwama (Ethiopia) — about 15,000 speakers, mainly in Benishangul-Gumuz
** Komo (Sudan) — about 12,000 speakers mainly in An Nil al Azraq
** Opuuo (Opo), or Shita (Ethiopia) — spoken in 5 villages north of the Nuer by about 5,000 people
** Dana, a newly discovered language located near Opo
** ?Gule (Sudan) — extinct

The poorly known Shabo language (600 speakers) shows strong Koman influence, and it has been suggested (on little evidence) that it may be a Koman language. Gule is generally classified as Koman, but the evidence is as yet insufficient.

===Otero (2019)===
Otero&#x27;s (2019: 28) internal classification of Koman:
* Koman
** Gwama
*** Highland Gwama
*** Lowland Gwama
** Central
*** Komo–Uduk
**** Komo
**** Uduk
***** Chali
***** Yabus
*** Dana–Opo
**** Dana
**** Opo
***** [clade]
****** Bilugu
****** Modin
***** [clade]
****** Pame
****** Kigile
==External classification==
Dimmendaal (2008) notes that mounting grammatical evidence has made the Nilo-Saharan proposal as a whole more sound since Greenberg proposed it in 1963 but that such evidence has not been forthcoming for Songhay, Gumuz, and Koman: &quot;very few of the more widespread nominal and verbal morphological markers of Nilo-Saharan are attested in the Coman languages plus Gumuz ... Their genetic status remains debatable, mainly due to lack of more extensive data.&quot; (2008:843) And later, &quot;In summarizing the current state of knowledge, ... the following language families or phyla can be identified: ... Mande, Songhai, Ubangian, Kadu, and the Coman languages plus Gumuz.&quot; (2008:844) However, Ahland (2010) reports that with better attestation, both Koman and Gumuz do appear to be Nilo-Saharan, and perhaps closest to each other.

==Reconstruction==
Proto-Koman has been reconstructed by Lionel Bender (1983) and Otero (2019).

<doc id="1147042" wikidata="Q6665458" url="?curid=1147042" title="Lockeridge">
<text>Lockeridge is a village in Wiltshire, England. It lies at the edge of the West Woods in the Kennet Valley, west of Marlborough, east of Avebury and south of Swindon. It is south of the A4 road which was historically the main route from London to the west of England. Lockeridge Dene is a hamlet immediately southwest of the village.

Lockeridge and its surroundings have provided evidence of Stone and Bronze Age activity in the area. Field enclosures close to the village indicate Roman occupation, whilst the village itself appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086. Lockeridge today forms an agricultural and commuter community with no local industry. The community is served by a village pub, the &quot;Who&#x27;d a Thought It&quot;.

== History ==

The area has extensive evidence of Neolithic settlement and a Bronze Age burial site was discovered behind the school in the 19th century. Field enclosures on White Hill (a ridge above the village) provide evidence of Roman occupation probably linked to the nearby fortress town of Cunetio. One possible derivation of the name is from the Old English composite word &quot;loc(a)-hrycg&quot; meaning &quot;a ridge marked by enclosure(s)&quot;.

At the time of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, Lockeridge was owned by Durand of Gloucester and is described as follows:&quot; Durand himself holds LOCKERIDGE. Almær held it TRE, and it paid geld for 2 hides. There is land for 1 plough. Of this 1 hide is in demesne. There is 1 villan and 2 bordars with 1 slave, and of meadow, and of pasture and of woodland. It was worth 40s ; now 30s&quot;. These two late Anglo-Saxon estates are held to be linked to the cluster of houses at Lockeridge Dene at the southern end of the village, and the eighteenth-century Lockeridge House at the northern end. Lockeridge House is adjacent to Piper&#x27;s Lane, remnant of a Roman road.

Building took place between the two Saxon settlements in the 12th century on the order of the Knights Templar who acquired one of the estates between 1141 and 1143. In 1155–1156 it acquired land in Rockley to build a Preceptory. Lockeridge is therefore something rare in Britain, namely a planned Templar village. The collapse of the nearby settlement of Shaw as a result of the Plague may have triggered growth as Lockeridge was situated at an intersection of a major east–west route (now the A4) and a crossing of the Pewsey Downs. The Templar link explains the absence (rare in Wiltshire villages) of a church.

The settlement expanded from a hamlet to a village in the 1870s when Sir Henry Meux sited his estate office (Gypsy Furlong) and the estate yard (Yardacre) in the village. Houses, a school and a pub were built at the same time.

In consequence of this history there are three main architectural styles in the village.
* Sarsen stone, generally painted or left rough-hewn, and thatched with wheat or wheat-reed mix.
* Victorian estate architecture built of dressed stones or Wiltshire redbrick with sarsen banding. Many of these are the work of C.E. Ponting, architect to the Meux estate in the 1870s.
* 20th-century solid brick council housing and in-fill in a variety of styles, in the main street and on Back Lane and Rhyls Lane.

== Governance ==
Lockeridge forms part of the civil parish of West Overton, which elects a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of Fyfield, named Kennet Valley Parish Council. It falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most local government functions.

== Landmarks ==

Lockeridge House, on the other side of the river from the village, was built around 1740 and is Grade II* listed. The two-storey house is in red brick, and its five-bay front has a pedimented doorway; there are later extensions at the right and rear. At the roadside entrance are brick walls of the same period, cast iron gates and piers topped with pineapples; Pevsner noted their large size.

Lockeridge Dene at the south end of the village is a National Trust site and is a conservation area. Sarsen stones are scattered over the area, and this is one of the sites from which the stones at Avebury were obtained.

The village is adjacent to the West Woods, which in spring are carpeted with bluebells.

Walks from the village lead through the West Woods onto the Pewsey Downs and the Wansdyke, an early medieval earthwork that ran from near Andover to the Bristol Channel and became the border between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex.

== Amenities ==
The Kennet Valley Church of England Primary School draws children from Lockeridge and nearby villages. The first building for Overton cum Fyfield National School, designed by C. E. Ponting, opened in 1875 and by 1906 was attended by 117 pupils. After numbers fell, in 1990 the school was federated with the village school at East Kennett; accommodation at Lockeridge was increased and in 2011 the East Kennett site was closed. For secondary education, most children go on to St John&#x27;s, Marlborough.

Kennet Valley Cricket Club has its ground next to the village hall, drawing members from Lockeridge as well as West Overton, East Kennett and Fyfield.

== Notable people ==
The Lacket, an 18th-century thatched cottage on the southwest edge of the village, was bought in 1908 as a weekend retreat by the politician and writer Hilton Young (later Baron Kennet), and was rented in 1914–15 by the author Lytton Strachey. The cottage was also the home of Young&#x27;s son Wayland.

From 1910, A. N. Whitehead and his wife Evelyn also had a cottage at Lockeridge, from where he collaborated with Bertrand Russell on &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

<doc id="1147044" wikidata="Q22111101" url="?curid=1147044" title="Clam shrimp">
<text>Clam shrimp are a group of bivalved branchiopod crustaceans that resemble the unrelated bivalved molluscs. They are extant and also known from the fossil record, from at least the Devonian period and perhaps before. They were originally classified in the former order Conchostraca, which later proved to be paraphyletic, because water fleas are nested within clam shrimps. Clam shrimp are now divided into three orders, Cyclestherida, Laevicaudata, and Spinicaudata, in addition to the fossil family Leaiidae.

== Characteristics ==
Both valves of the shell are held together by a strong closing muscle. The animals react to danger by contracting the muscle, so that the valves close tightly and the crustacean, as if dead, lies motionlessly at the bottom of the pool.

In most species the head is dorsoventrally compressed. The sessile compound eyes are close together and located on the forehead; in the genus &quot;Cyclestheria&quot; they are truly fused. In front of them is a simple naupliar eye. The first pair of antennae is reduced and unsegmented. The second pair of antennae, however, is long and biramous. Both branches are covered with numerous bristles. The crustaceans swim primarily by swooping the antennae. In the common genus &quot;Lynceus&quot;, which can open its spherical valves wide, the thoracic legs move in an oar-like manner along with the antennae.

The number of segments constituting the thorax varies from 10 to 32, and the number of legs varies accordingly. They are similar in structure to the legs of tadpole shrimp, and similarly, their size decreases from front to back. In females, the outer lobes of several middle legs are modified into long, upward-bending threadlike outgrowths, used to hold the eggs on the dorsal side of the body under the shell. However, the main functions of the thoracic legs are respiration and carrying food forward to the mouth. The gills are basically the outer lobes of all thoracic legs that are closest to the base of the leg. The legs are in constant movement, and the water between the valves of the carapace is quickly renewed. The body ends in a large chitinised telson, which is either laterally compressed and bears a pair of large hooks, or dorsoventrally compressed, with short hooks.

== Reproduction and development ==
=== Reproduction ===
Clam shrimp have different reproductive strategies. For example, within the family Limnadiidae are found dioecious (male-female), hermaphroditic (only hermaphrodites), and androdioecious (male-hermaphrodite) species.

=== Life cycle ===
The eggs are surrounded by a tough shell and can withstand drying out, freezing and other hostile conditions. In some species these eggs can hatch after as long as 7 years.

When the egg arrives in a suitable pool, a larva hatches out at the nauplius stage (the nauplius stage is absent in Cyclestherida). Clam shrimp nauplii are distinguished by very small front antennae. At the second stage (metanauplius), the larva develops the small shell. They develop very quickly. For instance, &quot;Cyzicus&quot; reaches sexual maturity in 19 days after hatching.

== Taxonomy ==
Extant clam shrimp belong to three orders, divided into five families; some notable genera and prehistoric taxa are also listed:

* Cyzicidae 
** &quot;Caenestheria&quot;
** &quot;Caenestheriella&quot;
** &quot;Cyzicus&quot;
** &quot;Eocyzicus&quot;
* Eosestheriidae (fossil)
** &quot;Bairdestheria&quot;
** &quot;Menucoestheria&quot; 
* Euestheridae (fossil)
** &quot;Laxitextella&quot; 
* Leptestheriidae 
** &quot;Eoleptestheria&quot;
** &quot;Leptestheria&quot;
** &quot;Leptestheriella&quot;
** &quot;Maghrebestheria&quot;
** &quot;Sewellestheria&quot;
* Limnadiidae (including Imnadiidae)
** &quot;Afrolimnadia&quot;
** &quot;Calalimnadia&quot; 
** &quot;Eulimnadia&quot;
** &quot;Imnadia&quot;
** &quot;Limnadia&quot;
** &quot;Limnadiopsis&quot;
** &quot;Limnadiopsidum&quot;
** &quot;Metalimnadia&quot;
* Palaeolimnadiidae (fossil)
** &quot;Krasiestheria&quot; (tentatively placed here)

Cyclestherida 
* Cyclestheriidae 
** &quot;Cyclestheria&quot;
** &quot;Paracyclestheria&quot;
Laevicaudata 
* Lynceidae 
** &quot;Leptestheriella&quot;
** &quot;Limnetis&quot; 
** &quot;Lynceiopsis&quot;
** &quot;Lynceus&quot;
** &quot;Paralimnetis&quot;
== Geological history ==
Modern clam shrimp have little significance to humans. However, extinct species of these crustaceans are often studied by geologists. In freshwater deposits, generally poor in fossils, the well-preserved clam shrimp shells are found quite often. They help identify the age of the corresponding strata.

During the past geological periods clam shrimp were apparently more numerous and diverse than they are now. 300 extinct species are known, and half as many living species. The oldest clam shrimp, such as &quot;Asmussia murchisoniana&quot;, were found in Devonian deposits. Many extinct species, mostly Triassic specimens, once lived in marine environments, where no extant clam shrimp inhabit today.

<doc id="1147047" wikidata="Q5378582" url="?curid=1147047" title="English honorifics">
<text>In the English language, an honorific is a form of address conveying esteem, courtesy or respect. These can be titles prefixing a person&#x27;s name, &quot;e.g.&quot;: &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;, &quot;Miss&quot;, &quot;Ms&quot;, &quot;Mx&quot;, &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Dame&quot;, &quot;Dr&quot;, &quot;Cllr&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;, or &quot;Lord&quot;, or other titles or positions that can appear as a form of address without the person&#x27;s name, as in &quot;Mr President&quot;, &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Captain&quot;, &quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Doctor&quot;, or &quot;Earl&quot;.

Many forms of honorifics are for members of the nobility, clergy, military, or royalty, these are found mainly in countries that are monarchies. These include &quot;Your Majesty&quot;, &quot;Your Royal Highness&quot; or simply &quot;Your Highness&quot;, which are used to address certain members of royalty and &quot;My lord/lady&quot; or &quot;Your Lordship/Ladyship&quot; to address a peer other than a Duke, who is referred to as &quot;Your Grace&quot;.

==Common titles==
* Master: () for boys and young men, or as a style for the heir to a Scottish peerage. It may also be used as a professional title, e.g. for the master of a college or the master of a merchant ship. 
* Mr: () for men, regardless of marital status, who do not have another professional or academic title. The variant Mister, with the same pronunciation, is sometimes used to give jocular or offensive emphasis, or to address a man whose name is unknown.
** &quot;Mr&quot; is used with the name of some offices to address a man who is the office-holder, e.g. &quot;Mr President&quot;; &quot;Mr Speaker&quot;, see &quot;Madam&quot; below for the equivalent usage for women.
* Messrs: is short for the French Messieurs, is a title used to refer to two or more men in a group.
* Miss: () for girls, unmarried women, and (in the United Kingdom) married women who continue to use their maiden name (although &quot;Ms&quot; is often preferred for the last two). In the United Kingdom, it has traditionally been used in schools to address female teachers, regardless of marital status. It is also used, without a name, to address girls or young women and (in the United Kingdom) to address female shop assistants and wait staff. 
* Mrs: ( in the United Kingdom, or in the United States generally, or or in the southern United States) for married women who do not have another professional or academic title, an abbreviation of Mistress. The variant Missus () is used in the United Kingdom to address a woman whose name is unknown. There are examples of professional women who were unmarried using the title Mrs, such as Mrs Crocombe, the Cook at Audley End House in the late 19th century. 
* Ms: ( or ) for women, regardless of marital status or when marital status is unknown. 
* Mx: ( or ) a gender neutral honorific for those who do not wish to specify their gender or who do not identify with Mr/Master or Ms/Mrs/Miss, for example if they are non-binary.

==Formal titles==
* Sir: for men, formally if they have a British knighthood or if they are a baronet (used with first name or full name, never surname alone) or generally (used on its own) as a term of general respect or flattery, when it is equivalent in meaning to &quot;Madam&quot; for women (see below). Also traditionally used to address male teachers in British schools.
* Gentleman: originally a social rank, standing below an esquire and above a Yeoman. The term can now refer to any man of good, courteous conduct. It is only generally used as an honorific form of address in the plural (&quot;gentlemen&quot; if referring to a group of men, or as part of &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot; if referring to a mixed group), with &quot;sir&quot; (or &quot;ladies and sir&quot;) being used for the singular.
* Sire: a term of address for a male monarch, previously could be used for a person in a position of authority in general or a lord.
*Mistress is an archaic form of address for a woman, equivalent to Mrs. Used on its own, it was used to address the female head of a household. The titles Mrs, Miss, and Ms are abbreviations derived from Mistress. The term is no longer commonly used because of its connotative meaning: &quot;&quot; is used to refer to a woman with whom a married man is having an affair.
* Madam or Ma&#x27;am ( in General American and either , , or in Received Pronunciation.): for women, a term of general respect or flattery. Originally used only for a woman of rank or authority. May also refer to a female procurer. Equivalent to &quot;Sir&quot; (see above).
** &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Madam&quot;, and &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot; are commonly used by workers performing a service for the beneficiary of the service, e.g. &quot;May I take your coat, Ma&#x27;am?&quot; 
** &quot;Madam&quot; is used with the name of an office to address a woman who is the office-holder, e.g. &quot;Madam President&quot;.
* Dame: for women who have been honoured with a British knighthood in their own right. Women (who are not dames) married to knights are commonly referred to as &quot;Lady&quot;.
* Lord: for male barons, viscounts, earls, and marquesses, as well as some of their children. In some countries judges, especially those of higher rank, are referred to as lords, ladies or lordship/ladyship. (Style: Lordship or My Lord).
* Lady: for female peers with the rank of baroness, viscountess, countess, and marchioness, or the wives of men who hold the equivalent titles. By courtesy the title is often also used for wives of Knights and Baronets. (Style: Your Ladyship or My Lady). As a plural, it may be used as an honorific for women generally (&quot;ladies&quot; if referring to a group of women, or as part of &quot;ladies and gentlemen&quot; if referring to a mixed group); &quot;madam&quot; (or &quot;madam and gentlemen&quot;) is used in the singular.
* Esq: () (abbreviation for Esquire) in the United Kingdom, it is used postnominally in written addresses for any adult male if no pre-nominal honorific (Mr, Dr, etc.) is used. In the United States, it is used in the same manner for lawyers irrespective of sex; usage of &quot;esquire&quot; by a person not licensed to practice in a jurisdiction may be used as evidence of unauthorized practice of law in some cases. It may also be punctuated as &quot;esq&quot; or &quot;esq.&quot;, following the same practice for other post-nominals.
* Excellency, also Excellence, a title of honor given to certain high officials, as governors, ambassadors, royalty, nobility, and Roman Catholic bishops and archbishops (preceded by his, your, etc.).
* Her/His Honour: used for judges, mayors and magistrates in some countries. (Style: Your Honour)
* The Honourable or The Honorable (abbreviated to The Hon., Hon. or formerly The Hon&#x27;ble) is used for certain officials, members of congress, parliament, presidents, and judges (Style: My Lord/Lady or Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, Mr./Madam Ambassador, Your Honor)
* The Right Honourable: used in the United Kingdom (sometimes abbreviated as Rt Hon) for members of the Privy Council (high government officials, senior judges, archbishops, etc.) and, formally, for peers below the rank of Marquess (normally abbreviated to simply &quot;The&quot;, e.g. &quot;The Lord Norton&quot; instead of &quot;The Right Honourable Lord Norton&quot;).
* The Most Honourable: for marquesses and marchionesses (and, as a group the Most Honourable Order of the Bath and His Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council).
* The Much Honoured: for Feudal barons, clan chiefs and lairds, it is stated in Debretts that Manorial Lords i.e. those who hold Lord of the Manor Titles are addressed as The Much Honoured as simply calling them Mr, Mrs or Miss is incorrect.

==Academic and professional titles==
* Dr: () (abbreviation for Doctor) for the holder of a doctoral degree (e.g. PhD, EdD, MD, etc.) in many countries and for medical practitioners, dentists and veterinary surgeons (including as a courtesy title in countries where these professionals do not normally hold doctoral degrees), although in some countries it is normal to address surgeons as &quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Ms&quot;, etc. The informal abbreviation &quot;doc&quot; () is sometimes used. Citizens of the United Kingdom who hold doctoral degrees or are registered medical practitioners may have the title &quot;Doctor&quot; recorded in their British passports.
* Professor: () (informally abbreviated to &quot;prof&quot; ()) for a person who holds the academic rank of professor in a university or other institution. In the United Kingdom, this is a senior academic position and the title is always used in preference to &quot;Dr&quot;, while in the United States, it refers to either tenured or tenure-track academic staff and the title &quot;Dr&quot; is often preferred. Professors may have their title recorded in British passports.
* KC: (abbreviation for King&#x27;s Counsel) is used postnominally in written addresses for a judge or barrister who has been made a King&#x27;s Counsel (KC). It is also used to denote a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) during the reign of a Queen. KCs may have this title recorded in British passports.

* Principal, President, Master, Warden, Dean, Regent, Rector, Provost, Director, or Chief Executive: as appropriate for heads of colleges at the universities of Cambridge, Durham, London and Oxford, heads of the constituent universities of the National University of Ireland, and the head of Trinity College Dublin.

===Judaism===
* Rabbi: In Judaism, a rabbi is an ordained religious officiant or a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word &#x27; , meaning &quot;My Master&quot; (irregular plural רבנים &#x27; ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word &quot;master&quot; רב &quot;&quot; literally means &quot;great one&quot;.
* The Reverend: Was often used for rabbis, cantors, &quot;mohalim&quot;, and &quot;shochetim&quot; in English-speaking countries. May sometimes be used for Jewish chaplains who are not ordained rabbis. This usage has widely gone out of usage in the modern era.
* Cantor: Generally used for Jewish clergy trained to perform the sung portions of prayer services. The word &quot;cantor&quot; comes from the French word &quot;chanteur&quot;, meaning &quot;singer&quot;.
* Chief Rabbi: Generally used for a leading rabbi of a city or country, often known in Hebrew as רב הראשי. Sometimes an honorific title if a community rabbi has an ancestor who served as a chief rabbi of a town, or for a son of a grand rabbi who is heir apparent to the position of grand rabbi and serves a rabbinical role in a Hasidic community. Generally, in such cases, this is known in Hebrew as אב בית דין, meaning &quot;leader of the rabbinical court&quot; (literally &quot;father of the house of law&quot;), and abbreviated אב&quot;ד. May also be titled as גאון אב בית דין or ראש אב בית דין, which would be abbreviated as גאב&quot;ד or ראב&quot;ד. These abbreviations may be rendered in English spelling as Ab&quot;d, Gaava&quot;d, or Raava&quot;d, and will often be called &quot;Rav&quot;. Generally the abbreviated title will be followed either by the name of the city or town (including ancestral towns), or the name of the congregation, or when called &quot;Rav&quot; the town or congregation will come before the title. For example, the chief rabbi of the Vien community is known either as &quot;Ab&quot;d Vien&quot; or the &quot;Vienner Rav&quot;. In some communities, particularly those from Hungarian and Galician backgrounds, the title is used interchangeably with the title of Grand Rabbi or Admo&quot;r.
* Grand Rabbi: The charismatic leader of a Hasidic court or community. Generally known in Hebrew as אדונינו מורינו ורבינו, literally &quot;our lord, our teacher, our rabbi&quot;, and abbreviated as אדמו&quot;ר and rendered in English spelling as Admo&quot;r or Rebbe. Generally the abbreviated title will be followed either by the name of the city or town (including ancestral towns), or the name of the congregation, or when called &quot;Rebbe&quot; the town or congregation will come before the title. For example, the grand rabbis of the Boston Hasidic communities would be known as either &quot;Admo&quot;r miBoston&quot; or &quot;Bostoner Rebbe&quot;.
* Rebbetzin: A rabbi&#x27;s wife, although in some sense a religious leader for the women in her community in some communities.

<text>Hey Babe is the debut solo album by American musician Juliana Hatfield, released in 1992.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the album tends &quot;toward bubblegum-sweet melodies and quirky little romantic narratives using the half-mature language of a collegiate creative-writing class.&quot;

In a 2018 article, &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to the album as a &quot;largely forgotten minor masterpiece.&quot;

<text>The Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790–1792) was a conflict in South India between the Kingdom of Mysore and the British East India Company, the Kingdom of Travancore, the Maratha Confederacy, and the Nizam of Hyderabad. It was the third of four Anglo-Mysore Wars.

==Background==

Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, and his father Hyder Ali before him, had previously fought twice with the forces of the British East India Company. The First Anglo-Mysore War, fought in the 1760s, had ended inconclusively on both sides, with treaty provisions including promises of mutual assistance in future conflicts. British failure to support Mysore in conflicts with the Maratha Confederacy and other actions supportive of Mysore&#x27;s enemies led Hyder to develop a dislike for the British.

After the British took the French-controlled port of Mahé in 1779, Hyder, who had been receiving military supplies through that port and had placed it under his protection, opened the Second Anglo-Mysore War. This war ended with the last British–Indian treaty with an Indian ruler on equal footing, the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore, which restored the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; under terms company officials such as Warren Hastings found extremely unfavourable for the British East India Company. Tipu, who gained control of Mysore after his father&#x27;s death in December 1782, maintained an implacable hatred of the British, and declared not long after signing the 1784 treaty that he intended to continue battle with them given the opportunity. He refused to free British prisoners taken during the war, one of the conditions of the treaty. Tipu Sultan further strengthened his alliances with Ali Raja Bibi Junumabe II the Muslim ruler and the Mappila Muslim community of a region under the Zamorin of the Calicut empire, thus expanding the Sultanate of Mysore&#x27;s sphere of influence.

British General Charles, 2nd Earl Cornwallis became the Governor-General of India and Commander-in-Chief for the East India Company in 1786. While he formally abrogated agreements with the Marathas and Hyderabad that violated terms of the 1784 treaty, he sought informally to gain their support and that of the Nizam of Hyderabad, or at least their neutrality, in the event of conflict with Mysore.

==Events leading to war==

In 1788, the company gained control of the Circar of Guntur, the southernmost of the Northern Circars, which the company had acquired under earlier agreements with the Nizam. In exchange, the company provided the Nizam with two battalions of company troops. Both of these acts placed British troops closer to Mysore, but also guaranteed the Nizam would support the British in the event of conflict.

Travancore had been a target of Tipu for acquisition or conquest since the end of the previous war. Indirect attempts to take over the kingdom had failed in 1788, and Archibald Campbell, the Madras president at the time, had warned Tipu that an attack on Travancore would be treated as a declaration of war on the company as per the Treaty of Mangalore. The rajah of Travancore also angered Tipu by extending fortifications along the border with Cochin into territory claimed by Mysore as belonging to its vassal state, and by purchasing from the Dutch East India Company two forts in the Kingdom of Cochin, a state paying tribute to Tipu Sultan.

In 1789 Tipu Sultan sent forces onto the Malabar Coast to put down a rebellion. Many people fled to Travancore, a state independent of Mysore and to Cochin, a state paying tribute to Tipu, in the wake of his advance. To follow them, Tipu began in the fall of 1789 to build up troops at Coimbatore in preparation for an assault on the Nedumkotta, a fortified line of defence built by Dharma Raja of Travancore to protect his domain. Cornwallis, observing this build-up, reiterated to Campbell&#x27;s successor, John Holland, that an attack on Travancore should be considered a declaration of war, and met with a strong British response. Tipu, aware that Holland was not the experienced military officer that Campbell was, and that he did not have the close relationship that Campbell and Cornwallis had (both had served in North America in the American Revolutionary War), probably decided that this was an opportune time to attack.

==Early campaigns==
On 29 December 1789, Tipu marched 14,000 troops from Coimbatore and attacked Nedumkotta. The first phase was a defeat for Tipu, when the Travancore forces under Kesava Pillai inflicted severe losses on the Tipu&#x27;s forces and drove them back. While the Mysorean forces and their allies regrouped, Governor Holland, much to Cornwallis&#x27; dismay, engaged in negotiations with Tipu rather than mobilising the military. Cornwallis was on the brink of going to Madras to take command when he received word that Holland&#x27;s replacement, General William Medows was about to arrive. Medows forcibly removed Holland, and set about planning operations against Tipu while building up troops at Trichinopoly.

===Medows&#x27; campaign, 1790===
It was May before Medows was prepared to march. In the meantime, Tipu had renewed his attack on Travancore, and successfully breached the Nedumkotta line in late April 1790, despite the heavy losses inflicted by the Tranvancorean army. The Travancorean army made a strategic retreat to the further bank of the Periyar River and regrouped, preparing to contest the crossing of the river. The monsoon rains prevented the Mysorean army from fording the river and as Tipu received the news that the British campaign from Madras began to take shape as a significant threat, he retreated from Travancore.

The plan of attack developed by Medows called for a two-pronged attack, with the main thrust against the Coimbatore district and a diversionary thrust into Mysore from the northeast. Cornwallis was unhappy with this plan, due in part to the lateness of the season (combat being much more difficult during the monsoon season), and the lengthy supply lines from Madras that the plan entailed. However, he was willing to give Medows the opportunity for independent command.

Medows moved out of Trichinopoly in late May. Hampered by weather and equipment problems, his progress was slow. He met little resistance, as Tipu had withdrawn his main forces to the Mysore highlands. On 21 July, Medows entered Coimbatore unopposed, after having taken some of the smaller fortifications in the district by either abandonment or the immediate surrender of the garrison. His only opposition consisted of 4,000 cavalry under Sayed Sahib that Tipu had detached to observe and harass his operations; most of these were eventually driven across the Bhavani River by Medows&#x27; cavalry. Further strong points in the district fell, with Palghat and Dindigul requiring significant action to capture.

Although the campaign was successful in gaining complete control of the Coimbatore district, Medows had to divide his forces to hold it, with the largest detachments at Coimbatore, Palghat, and Sathyamangalam. The attack from Bengal, and a third from Bombay, were late in getting started when Tipu made his counterattack.

===Tipu&#x27;s counterattack===
On 2 September, Tipu left Srirangapatnam at the head of a 40,000-man army. Descending the mountain passes beginning on 9 September, he began to move toward Sathyamangalam. While the 2,800-man garrison there withstood an initial assault from Tipu&#x27;s force on 13 September, Captain John Floyd, the garrison commander, opted to withdraw. Under cover of night, they crossed the Bhavani and headed for Coimbatore. Tipu, slowed by heavy rains, sent 15,000 cavalry in pursuit. These eventually caught up and captured much of Floyd&#x27;s baggage train, and continued to pursue the weary garrison. That evening, the full force of Tipu&#x27;s army fell upon them as they camped at Cheyoor. A desperate stand by the infantry repulsed repeated assaults, and only the arrival of reinforcements sent by Medows rescued them.

Tipu then embarked on a campaign of harassing the British supply and communications, while screening the movements of his main force. In early November, he successfully misled Medows, moving much of his army north to attack the smaller Bengal force. This force, about 9,000 men led by Colonel Maxwell, had reached Kaveripattinam and strongly fortified his position. Unable to penetrate the defences, Tipu withdrew to the south on 14 November after learning that Medows was on his trail again. Medows and Maxwell joined forces on 17 November, and pursued Tipu, who had decided to make a move toward Trichinopoly. Unable to do more than pillage the town before Medows arrived, Tipu then moved on to rampage through the Carnatic, destroying towns and seizing supplies as he went. He ended up at the French outpost at Pondicherry, where he attempted to interest the French in supporting his efforts against the British. As France was then in the early stages of its revolution, these efforts were entirely unsuccessful. Medows at this point moved toward Madras, where he turned over command of his army to Lord Cornwallis.

===Allied advances===

Tipu sultan had turned the wars against the British, Kerala and the Marathas into a religious war, as evidenced by his personal letters.
He massacred numerous Hindus and Christians, not sparing even the women and children and destroyed numerous churches, Hindu temples and even synagogues. Tipu has been a controversial figure and criticised for his repression of Hindus and Christians. Various sources describe the massacres, imprisonment, forced conversion, and circumcision of Hindus (Kodavas of Coorg and Nairs of Malabar) and Christians (Catholics of Mangalore) and the destruction of churches and temples which are cited as evidence for his religious intolerance. He also reneged on his promises of humanely treating and releasing the prisoners of wars, e.g. in one case noted by a chronicler, he killed a local king who had submitted to him and got his body dragged through the city. Many Christian missionaries also documented his torture of local Christians and destroying their churches and temples. 

However, others have pointed out that Tipu&#x27;s actions against the Hindus of Coorg and Malabar, and the Nairs were in consequence were due to political motives, after they had rebelled &quot;six times&quot; and he had forgiven them, similar to how he punished the Christians of Kanara during the Second Anglo-Mysore War after they had committed treason, rendering invaluable help to the English. In fact, a Maratha raid had destroyed a Hindu temple at Sringeri during the war in 1791, committing sacrilege by plundering the temple and killing or wounding locals, which included locals and Brahamins, leading its Swami to plea for help from Tipu, who quickly dispatched men and funds to help restore the temple.
That Tipu had appointed various Hindus to high posts at court and as officers in his army during the war stands contrary to the claims that he turned the battle into a religious war, and given that Tipu had given grants to numerous temples, and never prevented Hindus from worshipping, funded the construction of a Gopur temple in Conjeeveram during this war, and even participated in and bore some of the costs of the local Hindu festivals which occurred during his stay.

During the summer of 1790, a Maratha army of some 30,000 under the command of Purseram Bhow, accompanied by a detachment of British troops from Bombay, began marching toward Mysore. The first several Mysorean outposts surrendered in the face of the large army, and it made steady if slow progress until it reached Darwar in September. The fort was weakly and indifferently besieged for 29 weeks, with the garrison finally surrendering on 3 April 1791. The army then continued to advance, reaching the Tungabhadra River in early May.

A second army, consisting of 25,000 cavalry and 5,000 infantry under the command of Hurry Punt assisted by a detachment of British soldiers from the Madras army, left Poona in January 1791, eventually reaching Kurnool without significant opposition. Hurry Punt went to confer with the Nizam, who had not crossed into Mysore in fear that Tipu&#x27;s large army would overwhelm his before it could be joined to that of one of the other allies. On receiving word that Cornwallis had captured Bangalore and was moving toward the Mysorean capital, Srirangapatnam, Hurry Punt moved out from Kurnool, and made junction with Cornwallis on 28 May.

The Nizam&#x27;s army, led by Mahabat Jung, advanced to Koppal, which they besieged in October 1790. Poor-quality cannons impeded the conduct of the siege, which was not successfully concluded until April 1791.

===British take the Malabar Coast===
British forces succeeded in taking control of the Malabar Coast late in 1790. One force under Colonel Hartley gained a decisive victory at Calicut in December, while a second under Robert Abercromby routed the Sultan at Cannanore a few days later.

===Nawab of Savanur===

Territory associated with the Nawab of Savanur were lost to the Maratha Confederacy. Such events caused mistrust between the English and the agenda of the Peshwa.

==First advance on Seringapatam==
Cornwallis&#x27; first goal was to take the strong point of Bangalore, which would provide a base for future operations against Seringapatam. He hoped that this would stimulate the allies to step up their activity. Anticipating that Tipu would engage in a scorched-earth campaign in the highlands of Mysore, he made significant arrangements for provisions. To assist in the hauling of supplies and heavy armaments he also retained a significant number of elephants.

Cornwallis took over the main Company army at Vellore on 29 January 1791. A week later he marched west, as if to pass through the Eastern Ghats at that point. This prompted Tipu to abandon Pondicherry and make haste for Bangalore, where he perceived his harem to be at some risk. Although Tipu placed defences on some of the passes, Cornwallis, after a number of feints, turned sharply north, and crossed the mountains at the Muglee Pass on 21 February against no opposition. He then continued to advance, against virtually no resistance, until he was very nearly before the gates of Bangalore on 5 March. Tipu had fortified the city and supplied the garrison, but he stayed with his main force on the outskirts of the Company positions as Cornwallis began siege operations. After six weeks of siege, in which the company had to repeatedly beat off attacks and skirmishes from Tipu, they successfully stormed the citadel.
After securing Bangalore, Cornwallis turned his army north to meet a supply caravan and the Nizam&#x27;s army, which took place on 12 April about north of Bangalore. Turning back toward Bangalore, Cornwallis found the Nizam&#x27;s men to be noticeably unhelpful. He had hoped that the addition of native cavalry to the army would assist in offsetting Tipu&#x27;s advantage in that quarter, but the Nizam&#x27;s men, commanded by Teige Wunt, were interested in plunder and in living off the army&#x27;s supplies instead of foraging and scouting against Tipu.

The Company then embarked on a series of operations to secure most of the area around Bangalore before moving on to Seringapatam. When Cornwallis was seeking a ford at which to cross the Cauvery River, Tipu offered him battle at a ford near the village of Arakere. In the ensuing battle on 15 May, Cornwallis flanked Tipu&#x27;s position and drove him to retreat behind Seringapatam&#x27;s walls. Since the Marathan forces were apparently not nearby, and it seemed unlikely that Abercromby would arrive with the Malabar forces, and his army was on the verge of starvation, Cornwallis then made the difficult decision on 22 May to destroy his siege train and retreat. Only three days later, the Maratha army arrived, Tipu having successfully prevented most of its messengers from reaching Cornwallis before then.

Cornwallis&#x27; retreat to Bangalore exposed the Coimbatore district to Tipu&#x27;s forces. On 11 June, 2,000 Mysorean forces laid siege to Coimbatore. Lieutenant Chalmers, the garrison commander, ignored orders from Cornwallis to withdraw if attacked in force, and chose to fight, in spite of having less than 300 men and inferior gunpowder. His defence was spirited, and reinforcements from Palgautcherry prompted him to sortie and successfully take the defenders&#x27; supply train in August. Eight thousand more Mysoreans then arrived, but Chalmers held out until 6 November. In violation of the agreed terms of surrender Chalmers and his men were taken prisoner.

==Second advance on Seringapatam==

Following the allied retreat to Bangalore, the armies of Purseram Bhow and Teige Wunt left the grand army to pursue territorial gains in Mysore&#x27;s northern territories. Purseram Bhow, desirous of recapturing the Bednore district that Tipu&#x27;s father Hyder had taken in an earlier war, captured Hooly Honore and Shimoga, although British forces attached to his army did much of the necessary work. Only the threatened arrival of a detachment from Tipu&#x27;s army prevented him from laying siege to Bednore itself. Bhow did not return to the grand army until after peace negotiations began at Seringapatam.

Whereas the earl&#x27;s younger brother, Commodore William Cornwallis, was engaged in the naval Battle of Tellicherry, Charles spent the remainder of 1791 securing his supply lines to Madras. To this end he laid siege to Nundydroog in November and Savendroog in December, both of which fell after unexpectedly modest efforts. He also ordered a massive supply operation to ensure that adequate supplies and pay for his army and those of the allies would be available. Spies were sent to infiltrate Tipu&#x27;s camps, and he began to receive more reliable reports of the latter&#x27;s troop strengths and disposition.

The relations between Cornwallis and the allies were difficult. The Marathan military leaders, Purseram Bhow and Hurry Punt, had to be bribed to stay with the army, and Cornwallis reported the Hyderabadi forces to be more of a hindrance than a help; one British observer wrote that they were a &quot;disorderly rabble&quot; and &quot;not very creditable to the state of military discipline at Hyderabad&quot;.

On 25 January, Sir Cornwallis moved from Savendroog toward Seringapatam, while Abercromby again advanced from the Malabar Coast. While Tipu&#x27;s men harassed the column, they did not impede its progress. Cornwallis established a chain of outposts to protect the supply line from Bangalore. When the massive army reached the plains before Seringapatam on 5 February, Tipu&#x27;s began showering the force with rockets. Cornwallis responded with a night-time attack to dislodge Tipu from his lines. After a somewhat confused battle, Tipu&#x27;s forces were flanked, and he retreated into the city, and Cornwallis began siege operations. On 12 February, Abercromby arrived with the Bombay army, and the noose began to tighten around Tipu. By 23 February, Tipu began making overtures for peace talks, and hostilities were suspended the next day when he agreed to preliminary terms.

==Peace==

Among the preliminary terms that Cornwallis insisted on was that Tipu surrender two of his sons as hostages as a guarantee for his execution of the agreed terms. On 26 February, his two young sons were formally delivered to Cornwallis amid great ceremony and gun salutes by both sides. Cornwallis, who was not interested in significantly extending the company&#x27;s territory, or in turning most of Mysore over to the Mahrattas and Hyderabad, negotiated a division of one half of Mysorean territory, to be divided by the allies, in which the company&#x27;s acquisition would improve its defences. He later wrote, &quot;If we had taken Seringapatam and killed Tippoo, [...] we must either have given that capital to the Marathas (a dangerous boon) or have set up some miserable pageant of our own, to be supported by the Company&#x27;s troops and treasures, and to be plundered by its servants.&quot; The territories taken deprived Mysore of much of its coastline; Mysore was also obligated to pay some of the allied war costs.

On 18 March 1792, Tipu agreed to the terms and signed the Treaty of Seringapatam, ending hostilities.

==Consequences==
A fourth and final war was fought between the British and Mysore in 1799, in which Seringapatam was taken, and Tipu was killed in its defence. The victors, rather than partitioning the country, forced Tipu&#x27;s family into exile and restored control of Mysore to the Wadiyars.

One notable military advance championed by Tipu Sultan was the use of mass attacks with rocket brigades, called &quot;cushoons&quot;, in the army. The weapons used by the cushoons sufficiently impressed the British during the Third and Fourth Mysore Wars to inspire William Congreve to develop Congreve rockets.

Cornwallis was raised to the title of Marquess for his actions in the war, while the native Indian soldiers under his command were awarded the Mysore Medal.

<text>Allyson Schwartz (née Young; born October 3, 1948) is an American Democratic Party politician who represented parts of Montgomery County and Northeast Philadelphia in the United States House of Representatives from 2005 to 2015 and Northeast and Northwest Philadelphia in the Pennsylvania Senate from 1991 to 2005. She has finished second in a statewide Democratic Party primary twice: for United States Senate in 2000 and for Governor in 2014.

Schwartz was also National Chair for Recruitment and Candidate Services for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In the 2014 election, Schwartz was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Pennsylvania.

==Early life, education, and health care career==
Schwartz was born Allyson Young in Queens, New York, to Everett and Renee (née Perl) Young. Her mother left Vienna in 1938 after Germany annexed Austria, and came to the United States, where she settled at a Jewish foster home in Philadelphia. Her father was a dentist in Flushing, Queens, and a veteran of the Korean War. She has a brother, Neal, and two sisters, Nancy and Dale. Schwartz graduated from the Calhoun School, on the Upper West Side of New York City, in 1966 and then enrolled at Simmons College in Boston, Massachusetts. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Simmons in 1970, as well as a Master of Social Work degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1972.

She worked as assistant director of the Philadelphia Health Services Department from 1972 to 1975, and executive director of the Elizabeth Blackwell Center, a reproductive health clinic in Philadelphia, from 1975 to 1988.

==Pennsylvania Senate==

===Electoral history===
In 1990, Schwartz ran for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 4th senate seat, based in Northwest and Northeast Philadelphia. She won the Democratic primary with 50% of the vote, defeating Jeff Blum (28%) and Robert Blasi (22%). In the general election, Schwartz defeated incumbent Republican State Senator Joe Rocks 58%–42%.

Redistricting pushed Schwartz&#x27;s seat into Montgomery County. In 1994, she won re-election to a second term by defeating Republican Tom Scott 82%–18%. In 1998, she won re-election to a third term unopposed. In 2002, she won re-election to a fourth term defeating Republican Ron Holt, the Montgomery County Register of Wills, 82%–18%.

===Tenure===
During her first term, Schwartz was instrumental in Pennsylvania&#x27;s legislative efforts to provide health care coverage to the children of middle-class families, leading to the creation of the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1992. CHIP served as the model for the federal plan that now provides health insurance to millions of children.

In a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, she was named the &quot;Best Dressed,&quot; to which she responded &quot;I appreciate the honor...it must be the scarves.&quot;

==2000 U.S. Senate election==

In 2000, she decided to challenge Republican U.S. Senator Rick Santorum. Pittsburgh-area U.S. Congressman Ron Klink won the crowded, six-candidate Democratic primary with a plurality of 41% of the vote. Schwartz ranked second with 27% of the vote, dominating the southeastern part of the state, most notably Philadelphia (60%) and Montgomery (62%) counties. She also won two counties outside of the region: Centre (33%) and Union (38%). However, this was not enough to overcome Klink&#x27;s dominance in the western part of the state. Schwartz did not have to give up her state senate seat to run in the Democratic primary for the U. S. Senate; Pennsylvania state senators serve staggered four-year terms, and Schwartz was not up for reelection until 2002.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Electoral history===
In 2003, Democratic U.S. Congressman Joe Hoeffel, of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th congressional district decided not to run for a fourth term, in order to challenge Republican U.S. Senator Arlen Specter. Schwartz had originally planned to run for Auditor General, but changed her plans after Hoeffel&#x27;s announcement. In early 2004, she moved from Philadelphia to Jenkintown, Pennsylvania in Montgomery County, where she still lives today. She won the Democratic primary, narrowly defeating former Philadelphia deputy mayor and National Constitution Center director Joe Torsella 52%–48%. She won 62% of Montgomery while Torsella won 57% of Philadelphia. While most former state legislators raise comparatively more money through PACs than individual donations, she raised $4,597,032 from individual donations and comparatively little ($558,376) in PAC donations. The 13th had historically been a classic Northeastern &quot;Yankee Republican&quot; district, but had become increasingly Democratic in recent years, especially after it was pushed into Philadelphia after the 2000 census. A Republican presidential candidate has not carried it since 1988, and it has been in Democratic hands for all but four years since 1993. In the general election, she defeated Republican Melissa Brown 56% to 41%, winning both counties.

In 2006, Schwartz was re-elected to a second term, defeating Raj Bhakta, a contestant on &quot;The Apprentice 2&quot;, 66% to 34%. In 2008, she was re-elected to a third term, defeating Republican attorney Marina Kats, 63% to 35%. In 2010, she was reelected a fourth time, defeating businessman Dee Adcock 56% to 44%. The 12-point winning margin was the smallest in her congressional career. In 2012, after redistricting, Schwartz&#x27;s district was given a larger Democratic majority when it was pushed further into Philadelphia, with 52% of the district&#x27;s vote cast in Philadelphia. She won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Republican Joe Rooney 69% to 31%.

===Tenure===
Schwartz was a member of the New Democrat Coalition and was the chair of the New Democrat Coalition Taskforce on Health. In this position, she had actively pushed for the greater use of interoperable and secure electronic prescribing systems throughout the country in an attempt to decrease medical errors as well as costs and liability to providers, health systems and patients. In January 2014, Schwartz resigned from the taskforce chairmanship in the New Democratic Coalition.

The first piece of legislation Schwartz introduced after being elected to Congress focused on providing tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed veterans. The bill was signed into law in 2007. In 2011, Schwartz introduced the Hiring Our Veterans Act, which was signed into law by President Obama in November of that year. The Hiring Our Veterans Act increased the tax credit for employers that hire veterans with a service connected disability who have been unemployed for six months or more, veterans who have been unemployed for at least four weeks, and veterans, not necessarily with disability, who have been unemployed for at least six months. In 2012, Schwartz introduced the Servicemembers&#x27; Access to Justice Act to improve the enforcement of Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994. Schwartz was backed by Senator Bob Casey, who introduced this legislation in the Senate on May 23, 2012 (Schwartz, 2012).

Schwartz was the first Democratic member of the House of Representatives to call for Rep. Anthony Weiner to resign following his photo scandal.

Schwartz was known as one of the leading health care experts in government. She authored several key provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including increasing access to primary care, banning pre-existing conditions exclusions and allowing young adults to remain on their parent&#x27;s health coverage. She is pro-choice and received a 100% rating from NARAL in 2011. She voted twice against Republican-led efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, and supported legislation requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortion care to women who could die without it.

==2014 gubernatorial election==

Schwartz announced her intention to give up her House seat to challenge incumbent Republican Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, who was up for re-election in 2014. On April 8, 2013, Schwartz officially launched her campaign. In February 2013, Schwartz stated that she would not run for re-election for the United States House of Representatives. Ultimately, she was defeated by Tom Wolf in the Democratic primary.

==Later career==
After losing the Democratic primary for governor of Pennsylvania, Schwartz became the president and CEO of the Better Medicare Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group funded by health insurance companies. The organization has been criticized as a front group for the health insurance industry. She left the group in January 2021 after 6 years at the helm.

==Personal life==
Schwartz is married to David Schwartz, a cardiologist, and they live in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. They have two sons.

<text>The 2001 [[Triple J Hottest 100]], announced in January 2002, was the ninth such countdown of the most popular songs of the year, according to listeners of the Australian radio station Triple J. As in previous years, a CD was released, this time featuring 34 songs (although not the top 34 songs as they were ranked).

When the announcers for the final stretch of the countdown—Adam Spencer and Wil Anderson—got to the number-one track, they first played their own parody track &quot;Matt Hayden&quot;, named after the Australian cricketer and set to the tune of &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; by OutKast. &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; actually reached the Hottest 100 the next year in 2002 when a cover by The Vines took it to number 30.

==Full list==

==Artists with multiple entries==

* For the first time since 1996, the Hottest 100 winner from the previous year did not feature in the countdown.
* This is the first Hottest 100 not to feature Dave Grohl, who appeared in all previous countdowns with Nirvana and the Foo Fighters.
* Regurgitator made their sixth consecutive appearance in the Hottest 100, having appeared in every annual countdown since 1995.
