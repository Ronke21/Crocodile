<text>West Hill is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the eastern end of the city, in the former suburb of Scarborough. It is roughly bounded by Scarborough Golf Club Road and a branch of Highland Creek on the west, the CNR railway tracks and Lake Ontario on the south, and Highland Creek on the north-east. The name comes from its elevated position on the west side of Highland Creek, a deep glacial ravine.

The section east of Manse Road, which roughly splits this neighbourhood in half, is often now referred to as the Manse Valley neighbourhood. It has less commercial development and more industrial development than the western part of the neighbourhood. However, both parts were treated as part of West Hill prior to development.

==History==

In the mid 19th century, what is now West Hill was part of the larger Highland Creek community, which extended from today&#x27;s Galloway Rd over to the Pickering border. In 1862, Eli Shackleton took over as postmaster in Highland Creek and moved the post office from the east side of the Highland Creek valley to the west. Following Shackleton&#x27;s tenure as postmaster, the post office was relocated back to the east side of the valley. In 1879, John Richardson opened a new post office on the west side of the valley officially known as &quot;West Hill&quot;. From 1906 until the closing of the line in 1936, West Hill was the eastern terminus of the Toronto and Scarborough Electric Railway, a street-car line. West Hill Public School is one of the oldest in Toronto, a school having been built on the present site in the 1880s, although the original building was replaced by a modern facility in 1994. West Hill Collegiate Institute is also an older high school in Scarborough, having been opened in 1955.

Until after World War II, West Hill was largely rural, although the stretch of Kingston Road (including what is now Old Kingston Road) running through it had some commercial development, some even dating back to the late 19th century. The neighbourhood&#x27;s oldest remaining buildings tend to be along this stretch.

In the 1950s the neighbourhood was still difficult to reach by road, except for access to the south-west towards the city because even at this point Kingston Road was a four-lane highway. However, access to the direct east and west had to navigate Highland Creek and required a steep descent and ascent. There was no access across the creek across Morningside. However, the main bus commuter bus route from downtown Toronto to Oshawa ran directly along Kingston Road as well. As such, early development in the neighbourhood clustered around Kingston Road starting in the 1950s. The first subdivisions stretched along the straight north–south roads running off Kingston Road, primarily those existing road allowances which were close together and allowed for back-to-back lots with minimum frontage and depth. Larger plots of land that were developed in the late 1950s through the 1970s tended to be laid out with curved roads, short connecting roads and dead end streets that made for quieter neighbourhoods but resulted in irregular lot sizes.

===Development (1960–present)===
Before the completion of Highway 401 in the 1960s, West Hill was one of the major shopping areas in the region. In the 1950s, it served communities as far away as Oshawa. However, as development spread east and north along the new highway, major commercial developments became less viable. A major regional shopping centre, Morningside Mall, built in the late 1970s, was left without a major tenant when Wal-Mart, Dominion, and Shoppers Drug Mart abandoned the mall. Morningside Mall was completely demolished as of late 2007, and has been replaced by Morningside Crossing, a plaza.

Another change occasioned by the building of Highway 401 was a drop in business for the large number of motels lining Kingston Road. Most of the motel sites have been redeveloped as commercial sites, and many of the remaining motels serve as temporary housing for Toronto&#x27;s homeless.

The neighbourhood grew quickly and by the mid-1960s there were several new public schools to serve the new residents, who were generally young families drawn to the lower home prices in the area. The area&#x27;s K-6 and K-8 public schools, Galloway Road, Eastview, Peter Secor, William G. Miller, and Heron Park, were all built in this period, as was the separate school, St. Martin de Porres. By the 1970s, two technical high schools, Sir Robert Borden and Maplewood, had joined West Hill C.I., as did Joseph Brant, a senior public school that accepted grades 7-8 from three feeder schools.

At the times of the earliest developments, sanitary sewer service had not been extended this far east. House lots generally had to be large to accommodate septic tanks. Development was largely limited to single family homes and low rise apartment blocks.

Road and traffic access to the neighbourhood quickly improved. During the 1960s, new bridges were built spanning the deep sections of Highland Creek on Lawrence, Morningside and Kingston. This allowed direct access to the new Highway 401 to the east and west. The introduction of the GO Train at Guildwood Station allowed direct commuter connections into the city. The completion of the Bloor-Danforth subway line to Warden Station allowed more frequent TTC bus service into the neighbourhood. Service improved again when the subway was extended to Kennedy Station

Commercial development centered around the triangle where Kingston, Lawrence and Morningside met, and spread out along Kingston Road and parts of Morningside Avenue. In the south-eastern part of the neighbourhood, there was industrial development along Coronation Drive, mostly catering to the chemical industry.

City services continued to improve and in the 1970s high rise apartment buildings were introduced. Most homes in the neighbourhood were upgraded to have both storm and sanitary sewers. This allowed redevelopment of many larger lots to allow more homes in existing space. By the late 1970s, almost all the land in the neighbourhood had been developed. Development peaked in the late 1970s with the building of Morningside Mall, an enclosed mall built on the site of a strip plaza, anchored by Woolco and Dominion.

However, although the development of the neighbourhood continued into the 1980s, its character started to change as many of the original residents started to age and residential patterns in Scarborough started to change. Commercial development in the Morningside and Malvern neighbourhoods improved, and residents who used to come to West Hill to shop now no longer had to do so. It was clear that Toronto was overbuilt with shopping centers and Morningside Mall started only to draw from the immediate neighbourhood as larger nearby malls such as Cedarbrae Mall and Scarborough Town Centre had better road access.

As such, recent re-development in the neighbourhood has been centred along the commercial areas surrounding Kingston Road. Disused commercial properties are often redeveloped as high density residential townhouses.

Home prices in the neighbourhood generally remain below average for the City of Toronto as a whole despite the average size of homes (predominately two-bedroom bungalows) and larger lot sizes. In addition, the neighbourhood&#x27;s population is slowly shrinking as the resident per home average continues to drop. Newcomers to the neighbourhood tend to be younger families looking for inexpensive housing in the city with convenient commuting connections.

In May 2004, police arrested 75 members of the Galloway Boys, a West Hill street gang.

==Education==


Three public school boards operate in West Hill, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB). TCDSB are separate public school boards, whereas CSV, and TDSB are secular public school boards, with the former being French first language school board, and the latter being English first language school board.

TDSB operates two active secondary school in the neighbourhood, West Hill Collegiate Institute. It was constructed in 1954 and opened to 376 students on September 6, 1955.

Schools in West Hill that are operated by public school boards include:

*Académie Alexandre-Dumas (CSV)
*Eastview Public School
*Galloway Public School
*Jack Miner Senior Public School 
*Poplar Road Junior Public school 
*St. Malachy Catholic School 
*St. Martin de Porres Catholic School
*William G. Miller Public School (TDSB)
*Joseph Brant Public School was opened in 1969 as a senior school named after Joseph Brant the Mohawk leader. Since 2012, the school operates from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8 after the closure of two feeder schools: the adjacent Heron Park Junior Public School and Peter Secor Junior Public School.
*Maplewood High School is a junior vocational secondary school opened in 1967 modeled after Tabor Park Vocational School. It is a specialized school providing students with special needs. 
*Sir Robert L. Borden Business and Technical Institute was built in 1965 and opened in 1966. This school, like Bendale, offered many business-oriented and technical courses in addition to academic programs. After the school closed in 2016, the TDSB retained ownership of the building pending its sale.
==Recreation==

West Hill is bordered on three sides by the Highland Creek, the community is surrounded by a system of parks. Morningside Park, and Colonel Danforth Park are located along the creek, while East Point Park is located along Lake Ontario at the eastern end of the Scarborough Bluffs. Parks in West Hill are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division.

The area has numerous sports facilities, including an indoor arena and a baseball diamond at Heron Park, and two swimming pools, one of which is indoor. There are tennis facilities at nearby University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. Other public amenities includes the Morningside branch of the Toronto Public Library, built further east of the former site at Morningside Mall, roughly at the geographical centre of the neighbourhood, on Lawrence Avenue, just west of Manse Road.

West Hill has a good mix of commercial establishments far more typical of an older neighbourhood than a new suburb. Fast food establishments do not dominate and there are many sit-down restaurants featuring a variety of cuisines including, Canadian Chinese, Caribbean and Middle Eastern, echoing the ethnic diversity of the neighbourhood. There are two supermarkets and numerous smaller food outlets. The area is well served by physicians, dentists and lawyers and features three pharmacies, including both major chains.

==Transportation==
The main routes through West Hill are Kingston Road (part of the former Highway 2), Morningside Avenue and Lawrence Avenue East.

The Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) bus service provides public transportation through the neighbourhood, operating on all the major streets in the area, allowing access to TTC&#x27;s Line 2 Bloor-Danforth subway at Kennedy station and the Line 3 Scarborough at Lawrence East station. Located along the boundary of Guildwood and West Hill is Guildwood GO Station. The station provides access to GO Transit&#x27;s commuter rail and bus services, as well as Via Rail&#x27;s intercity rail routes.

== Notable places ==

* St. Margaret in-the-Pines - chapel (c. 1906) and cemetery; it was home to Anglican Church from 1833 to 1846; abandoned for Christ Church in Scarborough Village. It was destroyed in a fire in 1904 and rebuilt as a Chapel.

<doc id="1137487" wikidata="Q333460" url="?curid=1137487" title="Ratan Tata">
<text>Ratan Naval Tata (28 December 1937 9 October 2024) was an Indian industrialist and philanthropist. He served as the chairman of Tata Group and Tata Sons from 1991 to 2012 and he held the position of interim chairman from October 2016 to February 2017. In 2000, he received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in India, followed by the Padma Vibhushan, the country&#x27;s second highest civilian honour, in 2008.

Ratan Tata was the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamshedji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture. He had also attended the Harvard Business School (HBS) Advanced Management program in 1975. He joined the Tata Group in 1962, starting on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter&#x27;s retirement in 1991. During his tenure, the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business.

Throughout his life, Tata invested in over 40 start-ups, primarily in a personal capacity, with additional investments through his firm, RNT Capital Advisors.

==Early life and education==

Ratan Tata was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), during the British Raj, into a Parsi Zoroastrian family, on 28 December 1937. He was the son of Naval Tata (who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family), and Soonoo Tata (the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata). Tata&#x27;s biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji Tata. He had a younger brother Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata&#x27;s second marriage to his stepmother Simone Tata. 

Tata studied at the Campion School, Mumbai until 8th grade. He then continued his studies at the Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the Riverdale Country School in New York City, from which he graduated in 1955. After high school, Tata enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture in 1962. While at Cornell, Tata became a member of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. In 1975, Tata enrolled in the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School (HBS). In 2008, Tata gifted Cornell $50 million, becoming the largest international donor in the university&#x27;s history. Tata also donated $50 million to Harvard Business School, Harvard University to establish an executive center, which is now called Tata Hall that supports over 9,000 executive education students each year.

==Career==

=== Early years ===
In 2004 Tata met architect A. Quincy Jones who spent three weeks as architecture design critic at Cornell. After completing Cornell, Tata briefly joined Jones at his firm Jones &amp; Emmons in Los Angeles. While Tata was planning to settle in Los Angeles, he was called back to India by his grandmother.

=== Later years ===
In the 1970s, Ratan Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group. He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an economic slowdown. In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata&#x27;s tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the Tata group brand. Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many responsibilities to younger talent. Under his leadership, overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses to take on globalisation.

During the 45 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenue grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times. When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the end of his tenure, the majority of sales came from brands. He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and sales internationally.

He also conceptualised and spearheaded the development of the Tata Nano car after the grand success of Diesel Tata Indica, which helped put cars at a price-point within reach of the average Indian consumer. Tata Motors has since rolled out the first batch of Tigor Electric Vehicles from its Sanand Plant in Gujarat, which Tata has described as to &quot;fast-forward India&#x27;s electric dream.&quot;

Upon turning 75, Ratan Tata resigned his executive powers in the Tata group on 28 December 2012. An ensuing leadership crisis over his succession drew intense media scrutiny. The board of directors of the company appointed his successor, Cyrus Mistry, a relative of Tata and the son of Pallonji Mistry of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which was the largest individual shareholder of the Tata group. On 24 October 2016, Cyrus Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons, and Ratan Tata was made interim chairman. A selection committee, which included Tata as a member, was formed to find a successor. On 12 January 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was named as the chairman of Tata Sons, a role he assumed in February 2017. In February 2017, Mistry was removed as a director for Tata Sons. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal later found in December 2019 that the removal of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons was illegal, and ordered that he be reinstated. On appeal, India&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Cyrus Mistry.

Tata had also invested in multiple companies with his own wealth. He had invested in Snapdeal – one of India&#x27;s leading e-commerce websites. In January 2016, he invested in Teabox, an online premium Indian Tea seller, and CashKaro.com, a discount coupons and cash-back website. He had made small investments in both early and late stage companies in India, such as INR 0.95 Cr in Ola Cabs. In April 2015, it was reported that Tata had acquired a stake in Chinese smartphone startup Xiaomi. In 2016, he invested in Nestaway an online real-estate portal that later acquired &quot;Zenify&quot; to start the online real-estate and pet-care portal, &quot;Dogspot&quot;. Tata also launched a companionship startup for senior citizens named &quot;Goodfellows&quot;, to encourage intergenerational friendships.

==Medicine==
Tata was a supporter of education, medicine and rural development, and considered a leading philanthropist in India. Ratan Tata was the highest international donor to the Cornell University. 

=== 1984 Anti-Sikh Pogrom victims ===
In the aftermath of the 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots, Ratan Tata extended his support to affected Sikh survivors by donating trucks through Tata Motors. This enabled Sikh truck drivers who had lost their vehicles during the violence to regain their livelihoods. His charitable donation enabled many Sikh victims to rebuild their lives and businesses. Following this act, Sikh drivers in Punjab and other parts of India continue to remain loyal customers of Tata trucks.

=== University of New South Wales ===
Tata supported University of New South Wales Faculty of Engineering to develop capacitive deionisation to provide improved water for challenged areas.

=== University of California ===

Tata Hall at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) is a state-of-the-art research facility that was opened in November 2018. The building is named after the Tata Trusts, which donated $70 million to UC San Diego in 2016 to establish the Tata Institute for Genetics and Society (TIGS), which is housed within the building. The Tata Institute for Genetics and Society at UC San Diego is a joint initiative between the Tata Trusts and UC San Diego. It aims to address some of the world&#x27;s most pressing problems, such as the spread of infectious diseases and the need for sustainable food sources. The research conducted at the institute focuses on a range of topics, including gene editing, stem cell therapy, and disease control. Tata Hall at the UC San Diego is a 4-storey building that is spread over 128,000 square feet and houses research facilities for the biological and physical sciences. The building has laboratories, offices, and meeting spaces that are designed to foster collaboration and innovation among researchers. It is a LEED-certified building; designed to be environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient.

=== Tata Education and Development Trust ===
Tata Education and Development Trust, a philanthropic affiliate of Tata Group, endowed a $28 million Tata Scholarship Fund that will allow Cornell University to provide financial aid to undergraduate students from India. The scholarship fund will support approximately 20 scholars at any given time and will ensure that the very best Indian students have access to Cornell, regardless of their financial circumstances. The scholarship will be awarded annually; recipients will receive it for the duration of their undergraduate study at Cornell.

=== Executive center at Harvard Business School ===
In 2010 Tata Group companies and Tata charities donated $50 million for the construction of an executive center at Harvard Business School (HBS). The executive center has been named Tata Hall, after Ratan Tata. The total construction costs have been estimated at $100 million. Tata Hall is located in the northeast corner of the HBS campus, and is devoted to the Harvard Business School&#x27;s mid-career executive education program.

<doc id="1137489" wikidata="Q2988632" url="?curid=1137489" title="Federal Executive Council (Australia)">
<text>The Federal Executive Council is a body established by section 62 of the Australian Constitution to advise the governor-general of Australia, on the matters of the federal government. The council comprises, at least notionally, all current and former Commonwealth ministers and assistant ministers. As the Governor-General is bound by convention to follow the advice of the Executive Council on almost all occasions, the Executive Council has &quot;de facto&quot; executive power. In practice, this power is used to legally enact the decisions already made by Federal Cabinet, due to the practices of the Westminster system making the cabinet a &quot;de facto&quot; authority in its own right.

There are some laws that specifically require decisions or actions to be made by the &quot;Governor-General in Council&quot;, which means that they must be effected by the Governor-General on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, as opposed to by a minister acting alone. The matters that are typically required to be dealt with by the Governor-General in Council include:

* the making of regulations
* appointing, renewing and removing statutory officers
* appointing judges
* determining the appropriate use of Crown land
* issuing proclamations.

The Australian Federal Executive Council is the equivalent of executive councils in other Commonwealth realms, and is similar to the privy councils of Canada and the United Kingdom (although unlike the UK privy council, the Leader of the Opposition is not typically a member).

==Composition==
The Australian Federal Executive Council formally consists of all current and former Commonwealth Ministers and Assistant Ministers (previously called parliamentary secretaries). Members of the Executive Council are referred to as Councillors and are entitled to the style &#x27;The Honourable&#x27; for life. Section 64 of the Constitution stipulates that when a Minister is appointed, that Minister shall also become a member of the Executive Council. There is no provision for such membership to come to an end, but only those Ministers in the current ministry who are invited to take part in meetings are in practice actually involved in Council activities.

The Governor-General presides over meetings of the Executive Council but is not a member. A member of the Cabinet is appointed to hold the position of Vice-President of the Executive Council to act as presiding officer of the Executive Council in the absence of the Governor-General, at no additional salary or allowance. However, the vice-president cannot sign Executive Council documents on behalf of the Governor-General.

The Governor-General has the power to dismiss any member of the Executive Council, but that power is rarely exercised in practice. It might be exercised if, hypothetically, a minister or former minister were convicted of a serious criminal offence. One notable case was that of the Queensland Senator Glen Sheil. Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s government was re-elected at the 1977 election on 10 December, and on 19 December he publicly announced the ministry he would be recommending to the Governor-General, which included Senator Sheil as the new Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs. Sheil was sworn in as an Executive Councillor but, prior to the scheduled swearing-in of the Ministry, he made public statements about apartheid that were at odds with the government&#x27;s attitude to the issue. Fraser then advised Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen not to include Sheil in the ministry—advice that Cowen was required by convention to follow. Sheil&#x27;s appointment as an Executive Councillor without portfolio was terminated on 22 December.

==Meetings==
Meetings of the Executive Council do not require the Governor-General&#x27;s attendance, but the Governor-General must be notified of the meeting in order for it to be valid. A quorum for meetings is the Governor-General and two serving ministers or assistant ministers. If the Governor-General is not in attendance, quorum is the vice-president and two serving ministers or assistant ministers. In the absence of the vice-president, quorum is three ministers, one of whom, a senior minister, will preside. In practice, meetings will only be attended by a small number of Councillors rather than the full Cabinet.

Most of the powers vested in the Governor-General, such as appointments and the authorisation of budgets, are exercisable only by &quot;the Governor-General in Council&quot; – that is, under advice from the Federal Executive Council. The Council acts as a formal ratification body for decisions of the Cabinet. In a parallel manner to the Royal Assent given to legislative Acts by the Governor-General after they have passed both Houses of Parliament, proposed executive actions will receive the approval of the Governor-General in Council after they have been agreed to by the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

An example of a Federal Executive Council meeting which the Governor-General presided over was the meeting on 11 September 2022, when the Executive Council advised the Governor-General David Hurley to proclaim Charles III as the new head of state of Australia.

<text>Turner Contemporary is an art gallery in Margate, Kent, England, intended as a contemporary arts space and catalyst for the regeneration of the town. The title commemorates the association of the town with noted landscape painter J. M. W. Turner, who went to school there, and visited throughout his life.

== History ==

=== Architectural design ===
The building was designed by David Chipperfield, whose design for the 3-storey, high gallery opened on 16 April 2011, 14,000 people visited in the first weekend and 500,000 in its first year. In August 2013 the gallery received its millionth visitor.

On 20 February 2020, Turner Contemporary became the first contemporary building to feature on a Bank of England note.

Turner Contemporary is the largest dedicated visual arts venue in Kent. It is a registered charity under English law.

== Recognition ==
In November 2011, the venue received an award from the British Guild of Travel Writers, for an outstanding tourism project. Queen Elizabeth II visited Turner Contemporary on 11 November 2011, as part of a wider trip to Margate.

<doc id="1137492" wikidata="Q265701" url="?curid=1137492" title="Cinereous bunting">
<text>The cinereous bunting (Emberiza cineracea) is a bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a &quot;passerine&quot; family now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae. This species was first described by Christian Ludwig Brehm.

== Description ==
The cinereous bunting is a large (16.5–18 cm, 21–29.7 g), slim bunting with a long, white-cornered tail. The term &quot;cinereous&quot; describes its colouration. It is less streaked than many buntings and has a thick pale bill. It has a greyish back with only subdued dark markings, and a browner tint to the wings.

The adult male&#x27;s head is dull yellow, with a brighter moustachial line and throat. In the nominate race of south-west Turkey, the rest of the underparts are grey, but the eastern form &quot;E. c. semenowi&quot; has yellow underparts.

Females are brownish grey above with a whitish throat and yellow only in the moustachial stripe. Young birds have a plain pale belly and streaking on the breast.

=== Song ===
The call is a harsh &quot;tschrip&quot;, and the song is a hoarse &quot;zru- zru-zru-zru&quot;.

== Ecology ==

=== Distribution ===
It breeds in southern Turkey and southern Iran, and winters around the Red Sea in north-eastern Africa and Yemen. A few isolated populations maintain a foothold within European borders, on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, especially Lesbos.

=== Habitat ===
The breeding grounds of this species are typically found on dry, rocky slopes and uplands, where shrubby vegetation and sometimes conifers provide cover. It may also utilize areas with scattered trees, such as the Calabrian pine (&quot;Pinus brutia&quot;), or taller bushes. Migratory journeys take this species to dry, open country, including semi-deserts, low, rocky hills, and barren agricultural lands. Wintering sites are often located in coastal areas with sparse scrub vegetation.

=== Food and feeding ===
Like other buntings, the cinereous bunting feeds principally on seeds. It takes insects especially when feeding its young. Its normal clutch is three eggs.

== Status ==
This understudied migratory species has been categorized as &quot;Near Threatened&quot; on the IUCN Red List due to concerns regarding a declining population, likely driven by the ongoing deterioration and loss of its natural habitats.

<doc id="1137498" wikidata="Q6657196" url="?curid=1137498" title="Live from Austin, TX (Susan Tedeschi album)">
<text>Live from Austin TX is the fourth album and the first live album by American blues artist Susan Tedeschi, released in 2004.

==Reception==

In a review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek called the album &quot;a nice collection of material... performed with a wonderful balance of passion and finesse,&quot; and stated that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t replace her studio outings in any way, but it complements them nicely.&quot;

The authors of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings&quot; praised Tedeschi&#x27;s performance of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot;, which she &quot;claims as her own with an intimate rendition.&quot;

Hank Kalet of &quot;PopMatters&quot; described Tedeschi as &quot;a tremendous vocal stylist&quot; who &quot;finds the emotional core at the center of each song and allows her voice to wrap around it.&quot;

Regarding Tedeschi&#x27;s guitar work, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Mike Joyce stated that she &quot;contributes a few concise and expressive solos that get the job done,&quot; although &quot;she can always get by on vocal talent alone.&quot;

<doc id="1137507" wikidata="Q2149029" url="?curid=1137507" title="Gracemere, Queensland">
<text>Gracemere is a rural town and locality in the Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Gracemere had a population of 12,023 people.

== Geography ==
Gracemere is approximately west of the city of Rockhampton. Because of the proximity of the town to Rockhampton, Gracemere has become a dormitory town, with many residents commuting the short distance to work in the city.

Gracemere Lagoon is to the north of the town ().

The Capricorn Highway enters the locality from the north (Fairy Bower) and exits to the west (Kabra).

The Central Western railway line enters the locality from the north-east (Port Curtis) where it splits from the North Coast railway line. It travels mostly immediately parallel to the highway through the locality exiting to the west (Kabra). There are three railway stops within the locality (from west to east):

* Malchi railway station, now abandoned ()

* Langley railway station, now abandoned ()

* Gracemere railway station, once servicing the town, but now abandoned ()

== History ==
&quot;Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu)&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River.

The area was first explored by Europeans in 1853, when the Archer brothers arrived looking for pastures for their sheep. They settled by a small lake, originally called &quot;Farris&quot; or Padgole lagoon which was named &quot;Gracemere&quot; in 1855. The name Gracemere comes from &quot;Grace&quot;, the name of Thomas Archer&#x27;s wife and &quot;mere&quot; which is a Scottish term for lake. They also located a suitable landing point for supplies on the nearby Fitzroy River, which later became Rockhampton.

In July 1855, Charles and Thomas Archer with around 30 other people including four Native Police troopers, four Aboriginal men from the Burnett River and their wives, left the Archer&#x27;s Eidsvold pastoral station in order to construct the Gracemere run. The Commissioner for Crown Lands in the Leichhardt region, William Wiseman, joined them to help locate the most appropriate area, and in August 1855 they determined the area next to the current Gracemere lagoon was best. The local Aboriginals led by &quot;King Harold&quot; wished to obtain peaceful conditions with the Archer brothers and in return for allowing the indigenous people to live in the area, the Archer brothers utilised Harold&#x27;s people to aid in forcibly &quot;restraining the outside blacks&quot; who were resisting British occupation.

Gracemere State School opened on 20 February 1871.

As Gracemere developed as a dormitory town, further schools were needed with Waraburra State School opening on 27 January 1987 and St Paul&#x27;s Catholic Primary School opening on 27 January 1988.

The Big G was unveiled at the entrance to the Gracemere Industrial Park on 18 August 2015.

Gracemere public library opened in August 2017. It was welcomed by local residents as Gracemere was formerly in the Shire of Fitzroy which had no public libraries.

Gracemere Shoppingworld opened in December 2014 with Woolworths and Best &amp; Less operating as the anchor stores along with up to 20 speciality stores.

== Demographics ==
At the , the town of Gracemere had a population of 8,401 people.

In the , the locality of Gracemere had a population of 11,315 people.

In the , the locality of Gracemere had a population of 12,023 people.

== Heritage listings ==

Gracemere has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Gracemere Homestead, 234 Gracemere Road ()

== Economy ==
Gracemere, as a commuter town, has a relatively low level of industry compared to Rockhampton.

Grazing, particularly of beef cattle, has long been the significant industry of the area. The Central Queensland Livestock Exchange (formerly the Gracemere Saleyards) is on the western side of the town. It is the largest cattle sales facility in the Southern Hemisphere and commenced a multimillion-dollar upgrade in 2019. It is at 16 Saleyards Road () on a site.

Gracemere is rapidly expanding with around 10 new housing estates under construction.

== Education ==
There are three schools servicing Gracemere. They are all primary, one Catholic and two public.

Gracemere State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at O&#x27;Shanesy Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 302 students with 23 teachers (18 full-time equivalent) and 16 non-teaching staff (11 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

Waraburra State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 55 Johnson Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 492 students with 34 teachers (33 full-time equivalent) and 24 non-teaching staff (16 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

St Paul&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Breakspear Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 310 students with 19 teachers (18 full-time equivalent) and 13 non-teaching staff (8 full-time equivalent).

There are no secondary schools in Gracemere. The nearest government secondary schoolis Rockhampton State High School in Wandal, Rockhampton. Currently, all high school students travel by a bus service into Rockhampton to continue their senior education.

== Amenities ==
Gracemere Shoppingworld is bounded by O&#x27;Shanesy Street, McLaughlin Street and the Capricorn Highway ().

The Rockhampton Regional Council operate a public library in Gracemere at 1 Ranger Street (). 

The Gracemere branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association meets at the Guide Hut in James Street.

== Attractions ==
The entrance to the Gracemere Industrial Park has the Big G, one of Australia&#x27;s big things. It is in the shape of a capital letter G and is in size and is made from of mild steel. It is on the southern corner of Somerset Road and Enterprise Drive ().

== Transport ==

As a dormitory town, most Gracemerians either drive a private vehicle or catch a bus to the city. The bus service, Young&#x27;s Bus Service, operates hourly between the town centre and South Gracemere. Traffic can peak at around 8:00 in the morning, with traffic being banked up for around 1-1.5 kilometres on weekdays. Infrastructure problems are now becoming a reality for the small town and surrounding Capricorn Highway towns. This has resulted in constant roadworks and upgrades of the highway road quality. This mass influx of vehicles has resulted in a proposal for a new western bypass for Rockhampton, to send vehicles right to the northern suburbs, avoiding inner city congestion and delay, as this is where many Gracemerians work.

== Notable residents ==
* Anna Meares - OAM and twice gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games
* Kerrie Meares - Twice gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games for cycling. She is the older sister of Anna Meares

<text>Danjaq, LLC (formerly Danjaq S.A. and Danjaq, Inc.) is the holding company responsible for the copyright and trademarks to the characters, elements, and other material related to James Bond on screen. It is currently owned and managed by the family of Albert R. Broccoli, the co-initiator of the film franchise.

==History==
===Founding===
Danjaq S.A. was founded by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman after the release of the first James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot;, in 1962, to ensure control of all future films in the series. The new company was named Danjaq from combining the names of Broccoli and Saltzman&#x27;s respective wives&#x27; (Dana Broccoli and Jacqueline Saltzman). The company was originally domiciled in the Canton of Vaud in Switzerland, hence the appearance of &quot;S.A.&quot; letters in the first legal name of the company. In 1962, Danjaq began its association with United Artists.

===Ownership===
Due to a series of failed business interests, Harry Saltzman&#x27;s personal financial difficulties forced him to sell his 50% share of Danjaq to United Artists in 1975.

In 1986, Albert and Dana Broccoli acquired United Artists&#x27; 50% stake in the company and so assumed complete control of Danjaq. John Cork claims that in exchange for the sale, MGM/UA received an exclusive distribution deal with Danjaq that is far more lucrative than when the shares were originally owned by Broccoli and Saltzman.

Danjaq&#x27;s legal domicile was changed from Switzerland to Delaware in October 1992. The Delaware company&#x27;s legal name was &quot;Danjaq, Inc.&quot; The company was converted to a limited liability company in January 1997. In 1999, as part of a settlement of a lawsuit between MGM and Sony, Sony acquired MGM&#x27;s interest in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film rights, while Danjaq bought out the rights to the novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

Following the death of Albert Broccoli in 1996 and Dana Broccoli in 2004, control of Danjaq was passed to Dana&#x27;s son (and Albert&#x27;s step-son), Michael G. Wilson.

===Copyright status===
Although the trademarks for material related to the Bond films are held by Danjaq, the copyrights to the first twenty film properties are co-owned by Danjaq, LLC and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (the technical successor to subsidiary United Artists). The copyrights to &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, &quot;Skyfall&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;, are shared between Danjaq, LLC, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., and Columbia Pictures. Danjaq, LLC also credited as one of its present copyright owners of the 1967 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, the other being original production unit Famous Artists Productions.

===Films made outside the control of Danjaq===
Two Bond films have been made outside the control of Danjaq: The first was the 1967 film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, with David Niven as Bond, and the second was the 1983 film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, a remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot;. &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was the result of a legal dispute involving Kevin McClory, one of the credited co-writers of the story used for the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;, who was awarded the film rights to the novel in a 1963 settlement with Ian Fleming.

==Litigation==
===Danjaq LLC v. James Bond Ltd===
On 13 July 2009, Danjaq applied under s.69(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2006 for a change of name of James Bond Ltd, which had been registered since 12 June 2009. James Bond Ltd was ordered by the adjudicator at the Company Names Tribunal to change its name and to not register another company with an offending name. The respondent was also ordered to contribute toward Danjaq&#x27;s costs.

<doc id="1137512" wikidata="Q7990239" url="?curid=1137512" title="Wexford, Toronto">
<text>Wexford is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the eastern part of the city, on the western end of the district of Scarborough, spanning Lawrence Avenue East between Victoria Park Avenue and Birchmount Road. There are many persons of Greek heritage in this neighbourhood. The Wexford Heights Business Improvement Area boasts 245 members and hosts an annual street festival on Lawrence.

==History==

The Church of St. Jude was erected in Wexford in 1848. It was once the Anglican church to the small village of Wexford, and survives today as a landmark in the modern urban area.

In 1953, Wexford, along with the rest of Scarborough, was severed from York County, forming the regional government of Metropolitan Toronto. The area consists of mostly post-World War II type bungalow housing, apartments, retail and commercial space. The city was merged with the rest of Scarborough and the five other municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto, forming the new &quot;City of Toronto&quot; in 1998.

According to the 2006 Census Visible Minorities comprised 45.4% of the total population, the largest minority group being South Asian at 12.0%.

A 2013 article in the Toronto LIFE magazine ranks Wexford-Maryvale 6th out of Toronto&#x27;s 140 neighbourhoods.

==Education==

Two public school boards operate schools in Wexford, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB).

Both TCDSB and TDSB operate public schools in the neighbourhood:

*Buchanan Public School
*George Peck Public School
*Manhattan Park Junior Public School
*Precious Blood Catholic School is a school located on 1035 Pharmacy Avenue serving Kindergarten to Grade 8. It opened in 1950 as &quot;St. Teresa School&quot; by the Congregation of Notre Dame in the village of Wexford. The modern school was built on the land owned by James and Jesse Grant erected in 1953 and opened in September 1954 with Sister St. Agnes of the Daughters of Wisdom as principal with 444 pupils and 15 staff members. The Congregation of Notre Dame withdrew its teaching duties in 1956. In 1963, the school had a population of 920 students. 
*Senator O&#x27;Connor College School, in North York
*St. Kevin Catholic School
*Wexford Public School
*Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts

The French-first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Wexford, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood, with CSCM/CSV students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

==Recreation==
Wexford is home to several municipal parks, including Wexford Park, located in the southwest of the neighbourhood. Municipal parks in Wexford are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. The neighbourhood is also home to several recreational sports associations, including the Scarborough Minor Hockey Association, and the Wexford Soccer Club.

==Landmarks==

Two shopping centres are located in Wexford, Wexford Heights Plaza, and Westford Shopping Centre.

The neighbourhood is home to a number of churches. They include:
* Church of St. Jude
* Precious Blood Roman Catholic Church
* Scarborough Citadel of the Salvation Army
* St. John&#x27;s Greek Orthodox Church
* Wexford Heights United Church (2002 Merger of the historic Zion-Wexford and Wilmar Heights congregations)
* Wexford Presbyterian Church

<doc id="1137524" wikidata="Q2339553" url="?curid=1137524" title="Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park">
<text>The Stein Valley Nlaka’pamux Heritage Park is located near Lytton, British Columbia. The park was established in 1995. The park is co-managed, operated, and planned through a partnership between the Lytton First Nation and the government of British Columbia. The park provides recreational opportunities and cultural heritage activities, and features a number of pictographs.

The Stein River and the surrounding watershed contain a variety of flora and fauna and have great cultural significance for the Lytton First Nations people. Stein Valley has been a sacred place and a significant source of sustenance for the Nlaka’pamux community for thousands of years. The valley borders the territories of the Lil&#x27;wat and St&#x27;at&#x27;imc peoples. Historically, it has been used as a travel route through the mountains, as well as a spiritual and cultural site of practice, particularly used for cultural rock paintings and writings.

The park is also used for educational and research purposes. The undistributed biodiversity in the Heritage Park has made it a location for ecological, anthropological, and archaeological research. The facilitation and authorization of such activities is also overlooked by the management board, which consists of three representatives from the Lytton First Nation and three representatives from the British Columbia provincial government.

== Etymology ==
The name “Stein” originates from the Nlaka’pamux word &quot;Stagyn,” meaning &quot;hidden place&quot;. It was given to the valley because it is not easily visible from the end of the Stein River where it flows into the Fraser River.

== History ==
The first issues between indigenous and non-indigenous people over public and government use of Stein Valley began as early as 1858, in the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. However, the conflicts that led to the park&#x27;s incorporation happened in the late 20th century, when the government of British Columbia intended to log the valley, but faced opposition from both Nlakaʼpamux people and environmental activists. While provincial government had already intended to log the valley in the 1920s, it was not able to do so because of the high cost. Conflicts truly began in the 1960s and 1970s, as logging became more frequent in southern British Columbia, when the provincial government reintroduced the idea of logging Stein valley and completed a study on methods of doing so. Indigenous communities and environmental activists protested this, some environmentalists arguing that the valley was the last untouched watershed in the southern Coast Mountains. Eventually, with the help of a local Fish and Wildlife officer, conservationists Chris Adam and Roy Mason negotiated a 2-year postponement. This postponement was initially intended to be used to explore management options. However, after years of debate, amid strong public support, and after an annual music festival raising awareness, the provincial government decided to protect it as a park on July 12, 1995, and the Stein Valley remains unlogged today.

When the park was established cooperative management agreement was signed with the Lytton First Nations to jointly manage the park. The cooperative management agreement stated that it did not undermine the aboriginal rights and title to the park, and allows members of the Lytton First Nations to continue to extract resources from the park for traditional, ceremonial or social activities. Today, the cooperation is done through management board, consisting of three representatives from the Lytton First Nations and three from the BC Government. The government provides governmental funds to maintain the park, and the management board itself sometimes applies for grants.

==Geography==
The park protects the complete Stein River watershed as it flows down from the eastern Pacific Ranges into the Fraser River, including several lakes and tributary creeks. Cirques and tarns are scattered along the upper range of the river watershed. Two canyon sections of the Stein River can be found on the east end and the west end of the valley. The main valleys, not counting the lower canyon, are composed of glacial landforms, U-shaped valleys, and hanging valleys which indicate the existence of vast glacier formation and erosion in the past ecosystem of the Stein Valley. The south-facing slopes in the lower valley are relatively drier and warmer compared to the north-facing slopes, because they are located in the rain shadow of the Coast Mountains. The park&#x27;s elevation ranges from 220 metres above sea level at the eastern end up to 2,954 metres at the summit of Skihist Mountain.

== Ecology ==
Stein Valley holds a substantial variety of flora and fauna throughout the park. The park is home to over 50 species of mammals, including mountain goats, cougars, wolverines, black bears, and grizzly bears. Bird species include golden eagles, sharp-shinned hawks, barred owls, pygmy owls, white-tailed ptarmigan, pileated woodpeckers and Rufous hummingbirds, as well as several species of chickadees, warblers and nuthatches. In the valley, the Stein River holds resident Dolly Varden char, rainbow trout and Rocky Mountain whitefish, migratory steelhead trout and Coho, Pink and Chinook salmon who return to their home waters to spawn.

The Stein Valley has extraordinarily diverse vegetation communities within the park. This comes from the valley&#x27;s transition from the dry interior to the coastal mountains and various elevation levels in the park. In the lower valley, ponderosa pine forests dominate. In the mid-valley, Douglas fir forests dominate. On the western side of the valley, there are more hemlock, spruce and fir. In contrast, cedar communities exist not only on the valley&#x27;s eastern side but also in patches throughout other parts of the valley. black cottonwood communities mixed with birch and aspen are prevalent within the Stein Valley River floodplain. Higher elevations within the park include stands of subalpine fir, whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, and alpine tundra. During the blooming seasons of spring and summer, you can find a wide variety of blooming flowers throughout the valley, especially at higher elevations.

==Recreation==
Stein Valley offers hiking, fishing, hunting, camping, and wildlife and cultural artifact viewing. There are about 250 km of trails, and 11 developed campgrounds. As of 2017, there are three cable crossings and a suspension bridge across the Stein River. The Lower Stein Valley, from the Lytton trailhead to the Suspension Bridge Camp, has become popular for school outdoor education groups.

<text>Willowdale is a neighbourhood in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in the district of North York. It developed from three postal villages: Newtonbrook, Willowdale and Lansing.
Willowdale began as a postal village (originally Willow Dale) which covered the area from Finch Avenue at the north to Elmwood Ave at the south and Bathurst Street at the west to Bayview Avenue at the east. The village of Lansing was from Elmwood Ave. at the north to approximately Hwy. 401 at the south and Bathurst St. at the west to Bayview Ave. At the east. (East of Bayview Ave. was the village of Oriole.) The north–south center line of both Lansing and Willowdale was Yonge Street. The postal village of Lansing remained in existence until the post office at Lansing corner (northwest corner of Yonge St. and Sheppard Ave.) was closed. When a new post office was built in Willowdale, the postal addresses of Lansing and Willowdale were combined as the new postal village of Willowdale, within the Township of North York.

North York City Centre is centered at the intersection of Yonge Street and Empress Avenue/Park Home Avenue and is commonly thought to be the core of Willowdale, as well as North York itself. Its high-rise residential and commercial development sets it apart from much of the rest of Willowdale. The Willowdale neighbourhood consists of single-family homes, condominium townhouses and high-rise condominium towers. High density development is restricted to along Yonge Street.

==History==
Willowdale was first settled by Jacob Cummer (Jacob Kummer), who immigrated to Canada from the United States in 1797. Cummer was a mill owner on the nearby Don River, a proprietor of a tinsmith shop on Yonge Street and a self-trained doctor and veterinarian. Cummer Avenue is named for Cummer.

David Gibson, a distinguished land surveyor, was another leader in this community. Like most of his neighbours, Gibson participated in the ill-fated Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. He was thus charged with high treason and escaped to the United States, where he found employment as the First Assistant Engineer on the building of the Erie Canal.

Gibson returned to his Yonge Street farm in 1851, after being pardoned for his role in the Rebellion. He then helped to establish the &quot;Willow Dale&quot; post office, named after the many willow trees that once graced this district. Members of the Gibson family were still living in Gibson House in the 1920s when the residential subdivision of Willowdale began to take place. The Gibson House, built in 1851 in the Georgian Revival style, still stands in its original location at 5172 Yonge Street, and is now a historic house museum.

Opened in 1948, York Cemetery was located in the southwest of the neighbourhood. Several notable individuals are interred there, including the Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, and Tim Horton. The single-family homes range in age from the original 1910 to 1950s construction (one- and two-storey pre-war houses and modest one-and-a-half-storey postwar houses). 

Beginning on a large scale in the 1990s, very large replacement two-storey luxury homes were constructed on lots originally occupied by smaller houses. It is in this neighbourhood that the term &quot;monster homes&quot; was first applied by Torontonians.

In 2018, the Toronto van attack, the deadliest vehicle ramming attack in Canadian history, occurred in Willowdale.

=== Willowdale United Church ===
This church (Cummer Chapel) was built on the northeast corner at Church and Yonge St. In at least the early 1920s, the northwest corner was occupied by St George&#x27;s Anglican Church. The first church in Willowdale was called the Cummer Chapel, located at the northwest corner of what is now Yonge and Churchill. This log meeting house was built in 1816 by Jacob Cummer on part of his farm. He and other early members of the church are buried in the cemetery which remains on the site, now on the east side of Yonge Street. The Cummers, who were the first German loyalists and farmers from Pennsylvania, had Lutheran roots. However, they readily mixed in with and married people with Methodist and other roots. Thus the chapel was designated as non-denominational. 

A large, yellow, brick and stucco church with a tall spire replaced the log building in 1856. It was called the Methodist Episcopal Church, and became part of the new United Church of Canada in 1925. Between 1931 and 1932, Yonge Street was widened and the front end of the church, facing west, was removed. The front door was relocated to the south side of the building. Following World War II, many veterans and their families began to settle in Willowdale. In 1946, the Rev. Welburn Jones became the minister of Willowdale United Church (WUC) and initiated a building program. In 1954 a substantial building was built on nearby Kenneth Avenue.

In 1966, his successor, the Rev. Lindsay G. King, completed the program. The Rev. King spent the rest of his ministry, 27 years, at WUC. While he was the minister of WUC, the Rev. King wrote a regular column for the community paper and he was frequently heard on radio and television, including the CTV and the CBC. Because of his lifelong interest in bringing psychology, religion and health together, in 1973 he initiated the founding of the Family Life Foundation (FLF) of Willowdale, a registered charity encouraging the development of healthy community and family life.

<text>Deathwatch is a 2002 horror war film written and directed by M. J. Bassett, and starring Jamie Bell, Laurence Fox, Kris Marshall, Matthew Rhys and Andy Serkis. A lost squad of British soldiers in World War I take shelter in an abandoned enemy trench, but it proves to be no refuge as the men find themselves hunted by unseen evils.

== Plot ==
During World War I, soldiers of the British 5th Battalion&#x27;s White Company under Cpt. Jennings charge a German trench as part of a larger assault. The young Pvt. Charlie Shakespeare initially refuses, but is coaxed along by Sgt. Tate. Many soldiers fall to machine-gun fire or artillery and the unit becomes lost in the fog.

After walking for hours, carrying Pvt. Colin Chevasse, now paraplegic, the unit comes across a maze-like network of trenches. There they find three terrified Germans, who ignore Private Willie McNess&#x27;s cries for surrender in apparent fear of something further down the trenches. Pvt. Thomas Quinn shoots and kills one, another flees, while the third, Friedrich, surrenders. Convinced they have broken through the enemy lines, the soldiers decide to secure the trenches. They explore and find ominous signs: rotting bodies with protruding barbed wire and German bayonets litter the ground. Compasses and watches also have stopped working. While detonating charges to close off some passages, they hear a demon-like growl and blood pours from the mud.

Later, Pvt. Jack Hawkstone is ambushed by the second German hiding in the mud. Jack and Pvt. Barry Starinski wound and subdue him, but Thomas executes him with a pistol and scalps him despite Tate&#x27;s interference. Attempts to contact command via radio reveal White Company was thought to have been obliterated during the assault before communications are lost.

Their first night in the trench starts uneventfully and Cpl. &quot;Doc&quot; Fairweather treats the wounded. Barry secludes himself but is distracted by strange sounds and finds three German corpses wrapped in barbed wire in a standing position. As he alerts the unit, one corpse suddenly comes to life and ambushes him. Charlie and Tate arrive to find Barry&#x27;s corpse lashed to the wall with barbed wire. Suspecting that hidden German troops are responsible, the men violently interrogate Friedrich (who can also speak French, which Charlie understands). He explains that the other Germans turned on each other and that there is &quot;evil&quot; in the trenches.

The next morning, White Company piles up the German dead and clear the dugouts with grenades. Phantom sounds of incoming artillery and charging infantry cause Jennings to crack under the pressure, mistakenly shooting and killing Jack. Morale and discipline deteriorate, with Willie thinking of deserting. That night he is chased by an eerie red mist, hears voices, and is drenched in blood. Snapping, he flees into no man&#x27;s land only to be shot by Pvt. Anthony Bradford. Doc attempts a rescue, but Willie, only able to crawl, is pursued by something tunneling in the mud that drags him under to his death. Meanwhile, Anthony, convinced that both he and the trenches are possessed by death, asks Charlie to shoot him so he will not kill anyone else. When the latter refuses, Anthony runs off.

In the morning, Thomas crucifies Friedrich alive on a wooden beam in no man&#x27;s land and savagely beats him with a club. Jennings, now insane, orders an inspection, but Thomas instead subdues and stabs the officer to death. Tate attacks Thomas, but during the fight gets tangled in barbed wire. Thomas then kills Tate and taunts Charlie when he refuses to shoot, but is then restrained and impaled by living strands of barbed wire that rise from the mud, forcing Charlie to kill him.

Freeing the crippled Friedrich, Charlie arms him with a rifle to defend himself before running off to find Doc. He finds Colin who, though pale and covered in flies, appears to be able to move his legs under the blankets. However, it is only the rats that have chewed off his legs, and Charlie tearfully euthanizes the boy. He then finds Anthony, who has tied Doc up with barbed wire and both men plead Charlie to kill Anthony. Again, Charlie refuses, and Anthony shoots Doc in the head. Shakespeare finally gives in and kills the chaplain.

The soil under the German corpse pile starts to cave in, while barbed wire blocks every passage, and Charlie is sucked down into the pit. He wakes up in a cave full of corpses, where living versions of his unit sit eating together like they were on the first night, including himself. He flees, reaching the trenches. Friedrich, now in perfect health, appears and points his rifle at him. Charlie, exasperated by the apparent betrayal, shouts in both English and French that he tried to help him. Friedrich calmly acknowledges this in English, saying he is free to go, pointing to a ladder leading up into no man&#x27;s land before seemingly vanishing. Charlie climbs out of the trench and leaves to an unknown fate, disappearing into the fog.

Some time later, another team of British soldiers arrives at the trench. Seeing Friedrich sitting idly alone, they shout at him to surrender, to which he complies by lifting his hands. He then gives an ominous stare before the screen fades, implying that this will all happen again.

==Reception==

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Deathwatch&quot; received an approval rating of 25% based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. Critics mostly praised the film&#x27;s creative premise and atmosphere, but criticized its story execution and editing.

Alan Jones of &quot;The Radio Times&quot; rated the film one out of five stars, writing, &quot;There&#x27;s little to set the pulse racing, apart from some ghostly noises and a few gory effects, and Bassett&#x27;s lumbering direction blasts any artistry, horror or suspense clean out of the target area.&quot;
Allmovie gave the film a positive review calling it &quot;a highly crafted atmospheric creep-out that knows when to go for the jugular and when to slather on the paranoia&quot;. TV Guide awarded the film 2.5/4 stars stating: &quot;Bassett deserves half a salute for &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-ish wallow in WWI misery, which works up some creepy atmosphere between scenes of dehumanizing combat. But the spook show element ultimately seems simultaneously ghoulish and hokey, and the pacifist moral is hammered home with blunt obviousness&quot;.
Peter Bradshaw from &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film a mixed review, praising the film&#x27;s premise and direction but panned the film&#x27;s dull script. Nev Pierce from &quot;BBC&quot; awarded the film three out of five stars, while noting the film had its faults, Pierce called it &quot;A creepy, authentically nasty little horror film&quot;.

<doc id="1137531" wikidata="Q1147172" url="?curid=1137531" title="Demand deposit">
<text>Demand deposits or checkbook money are funds held in demand accounts in commercial banks. These account balances are usually considered money and form the greater part of the narrowly defined money supply of a country. Simply put, these are deposits in the bank that can be withdrawn on demand, without any prior notice.

==History==
In the United States, demand deposits arose following the 1865 tax of 10% on the issuance of state bank notes; see history of banking in the USA.

In the U.S., demand deposits only refer to funds held in checking accounts (or cheque offering accounts) other than NOW accounts; however, in a 1970s and 1980s response to the 1933 promulgation of Regulation Q in the U.S., demand deposits in some cases came to allow easier access to funds from other types of accounts (e.g. savings accounts and money market accounts). For the historical basis of the distinction between demand deposits and NOW accounts in the U.S., see Negotiable order of withdrawal account.

==Money supply==
Demand deposits are usually considered part of the narrowly defined money supply, as they can be used, via checks and drafts, as a means of payment for goods and services and to settle debts. The money supply of a country is usually defined to consist of currency plus demand deposits. In most countries, demand deposits account for a majority of the money supply.

During times of financial crisis, bank customers will withdraw their funds in cash, leading to a drop in demand deposits and a shrinking of the money supply. Economists have speculated that this effect contributed to the severity of the Great Depression.

This did not happen, however, in the financial crisis that began in 2008. In fact, demand deposits in the U.S. increased dramatically, from around $310 billion in August 2008 to a peak of around $460 billion in December 2008.

<doc id="1137544" wikidata="Q7430322" url="?curid=1137544" title="Scarborough Village">
<text>Scarborough Village is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in the larger namesake Scarborough district. It was one of the earliest settlements in the former township of Scarborough with the distinction of being the site of the township&#x27;s first post office. Despite this, it was not the town centre from where the later (and now defunct) City of Scarborough grew, with mass urbanization of the former municipality actually having begun as spillover growth from the old City of Toronto at Birch Cliff in the district&#x27;s southwestern extremity. Today, the neighbourhood is composed of private and public housing, apartment complexes, schools, a few condominiums, and strip mall plazas. The neighbourhood lies along the Scarborough Bluffs escarpment.

==History==
Scarborough Village established as a settlement in the 1800s by Cornell and Secor as a crossroads village. It was centered on Markham Road between Kingston Road to the south and Eglinton Avenue to the north. The area provided settlers with access to the lakeshore and partially served as a through-way for
soldiers during the War of 1812. In 1832, it became the first community in the former Township of Scarborough to have its own post office. By 1856, Scarborough Village became a subdivision and by 1860, the area of Scarborough Village had its first completed brick schoolhouse. By the 1890s, a general store, a blacksmith shop, a store that sold farm accessories, and a large railway hotel were built in the area. The area only contained about a dozen dwellings. 

During the 1930s, Kingston Road had become a major route connecting Toronto with the rest of eastern Ontario communities, as well as Montreal. After the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway tracks north of Eglinton Avenue, Kingston Road had decreased in traffic and few businesses began to close.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2006 Canadian census (0331.01 census tract) approximately 80% of the population is first generation Canadian. Meaning that 80% of the population was born outside of Canada compared to the 9% who are second generation and 11% who are third generation. Second generation refers to persons who were born in Canada, but have at least one parent who was born outside of Canada, and third generation refers to persons who were born in Canada with both parents born in Canada.

However, in the 2011 National Household Survey the number of first generation Canadian&#x27;s shrunk to 68%, while the second generation percentage increased to 26%. Additionally, the percentage of third generation Canadian&#x27;s decreased to 6%. The average income among individual incomes between 2006 and 2011 has increased by 10.95% (Statistics Canada, 2011). However, individuals under the $10,000 and $19,999 category showed a dropped significantly in income levels in 2011, 185 individual are making less money under this category (Statistics Canada, 2011).. The most significant increase occurs in the 20,000 to 29,999 category, which reveals an increase of 300 individuals (Statistics Canada, 2011).

==Education==

Two public school boards operate elementary schools in the area, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Public elementary schools in Scarborough village include:

* Cedar Drive Public School
* George P. Mackie Junior Public School
* Mason Road Junior Public School
* Scarborough Village Public School (Formerly School Section no. 9)
* St. Boniface Catholic School

Neither TCDSB nor TDSB operate a secondary school in the neighbourhood, and students reside in Scarborough Village attending secondary schools in adjacent areas. The French-based public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it Catholic counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, also offer schooling to applicable residents of Scarborough Village but do not operate schools in the neighbourhood, with students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

==Transportation==

The neighbourhood is served by Toronto Transit Commission bus routes 86 Scarborough, 116 Morningside, 905 Eglinton East Express, and 986 Scarborough Express, which connect to Kennedy station, a station for the Toronto subway. Other routes, 102 Markham and 9 Bellamy, connect to Warden station to the south while the latter route connects to the Scarborough Centre station to the north.

Located at the northwestern boundary of Scarborough Village, on Eglinton Avenue is Eglinton GO Station. The station provides access to GO Transit&#x27;s commuter rail lines to Downtown Toronto, as well as other destinations along its line.

Its southern border, Kingston Road, is a major roadway providing access to south-western Scarborough, East York, Old Toronto and Downtown Toronto in the west and extends to Durham Region in the east.

==Notable places==
*Markington Square — largest plaza in Scarborough Village
*Christ Church of Scarborough Village — oldest church in Scarborough Village (c. 1846 though rebuilt several times - 1921 after fire at original site in 1918 and relocation in 1937)
*Scarborough Village Community Centre — a branch of the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division
*Scarborough Village Theatre — part of the Scarborough Village Community Centre and home to Scarborough music theatre, Scarborough Players, and Scarborough Theatre Guild

<text>Ibrahim Abboud (; 26 October 1900 – 8 September 1983) was a Sudanese military officer and political figure who served as the head of state of Sudan between 1958 and 1964 and as President of Sudan in 1964; however, he soon resigned, ending Sudan&#x27;s first period of military rule. A career soldier, Abboud served in World War II in Egypt and Iraq. In 1949, Abboud became the deputy Commander in Chief of the Sudanese military. Upon independence, Abboud became the Commander in Chief of the Military of Sudan.

== Early life and early career ==
Ibrahim Abboud was born 26 October 1900 in Mohammed-Gol, near the old port city of Suakin on the Red Sea. He trained as an engineer at the Gordon Memorial College and at the Military College in Khartoum. He received a commission in the Egyptian Army in 1918 and transferred to the Sudan Defence Force in 1925, after its creation separate from the Egyptian army. During World War II he served in Eritrea, in Ethiopia, with the Sudan Defence Force, and with the British Army in North Africa. After the war, Abboud commanded the Camel Corps, and then rose rapidly to commander of the Sudan Defence Force in 1949 and assistant commander in chief in 1954. With the declaration of independence for the Sudan in 1956, he was made commander in chief of the Sudanese military forces. After the Sudanese army staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in November 1958, overthrowing the civilian government of Abdallah Khalil, Gen. Abboud led the new military government. Philip Agee alleged that CIA engineered the 1958 coup in &quot;In the Company.&quot;

Between 1956 and 1958, Sudanese nationalist leaders from both major parties sought to find solutions to the seemingly intractable problems of building a nation, developing the economy and creating a permanent constitution. Neither Ismail al-Azhari, leader of the Nationalist Unionist Party and the first Prime Minister of Sudan, nor his rival, Abdallah Khalil, the Umma party leader and successor to al-Azhari as prime minister, was able to overcome the weaknesses of the political system or to grapple with the country&#x27;s problems. Parliamentary government was so discredited that Gen. Abboud, who formerly had remained studiously aloof from politics, led a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; on 17 November 1958, to end, in his words, &quot;the state of degeneration, chaos, and instability of the country.&quot; The Council of State and cabinet were dismissed, parliament and all political parties were declared dissolved, and the constitution was suspended.

==Chief of the Military Government==
At first Abboud and his ruling Supreme Council of Twelve had the tacit support of the Sudanese politicians and people. The country was tired of the intrigues of the politicians and was prepared to permit the military to inaugurate an efficient and incorruptible administration. There was opposition only within the military in the first few months of the military government. This was the result of disagreements among the senior military leaders. But within a year many younger officers, and even cadets, rose to challenge Abboud&#x27;s position. All of them were quickly suppressed.

==Abboud&#x27;s Regime==

Abboud moved swiftly to deal with the Sudan&#x27;s problems. The provisional constitution was suspended and all political parties dissolved. The price of Sudanese cotton was lowered, and the surplus from the crop of 1958 and the bumper crop of 1959 was sold, easing the financial crisis. An agreement was reached with Egypt concerning the division of the Nile waters, and although Sudan did not receive as great an allotment as many Sudanese thought equitable, Egypt recognized the independence of Sudan, and frontier conflicts ceased. Finally, in 1961, an ambitious 10-year development plan was launched, designed to end Sudan&#x27;s dependence on cotton exports and many foreign manufactured imports.

Although Abboud dealt with the important economic problems and improved foreign relations, he made little attempt to capitalize on his successes to forge a political following outside the army. His political independence certainly enabled him to act decisively, but his actions frequently alienated large segments of the population, which his government ultimately needed to remain in power without resort to force. He sought to meet demands of the population for increased participation in government by instituting a system of local representative government and the &quot;erection of a central council ... in a pyramid with the local councils as a base.&quot; The creation of such councils clearly shifted power to the rural areas, whose conservatism would counter complaints from the more liberal urban critics who were becoming increasingly frustrated by increasingly arbitrary administration.

==&quot;Southern Problem&quot;==

In spite of its weaknesses, Abboud&#x27;s government might have lasted longer if not for the &quot;southern problem.&quot; Abboud was personally popular or, at least, respected. He was even invited to the White House in 1961, where President John F. Kennedy praised Sudan for having set a good example for living in peace with its neighbours.

In non-Arab, non-Muslim southern Sudan, however, the arbitrary rule of the military government produced a more negative reaction than in the north. Thus, the government&#x27;s vigorous program of Arabization and Islamization in the south provoked strikes in the schools and open revolt in the countryside. Opposition to the government was met by force, and many southerners fled as refugees into neighbouring countries. By 1963 the conflict had escalated to a civil war in which the northern troops held the towns while the southern guerrillas roamed the countryside. Abboud&#x27;s forces were responsible for large numbers of deaths in Kodok, Yei and Maridi, and overall his government was responsible for the deaths of more Sudanese people than any other head of state until Omar al-Bashir. Finally, in August 1964, in a desperate attempt to find a solution to the enervating campaign in the south, Abboud established a 25-man commission to study the problem and make recommendations for its solution. When the commission, in turn, asked for public debate on the &quot;southern question,&quot; the students of Khartoum University initiated a series of debates that soon turned into a forum for open criticism of all aspects of the administration. The government banned these debates, precipitating student demonstrations in which one student was killed. The situation rapidly deteriorated, and within two days the civil service and the transport workers were on strike. Demonstrations followed in the provinces. Rather than suppress the opposition by armed force and bloodshed, Abboud dissolved his government on 26 October 1964, and allowed the formation of a provisional cabinet under Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa to replace the Supreme Council. Abboud himself was forced to resign on 15 November in favor of a civilian provisional government, and he retreated into retirement, thus ending the Republic of the Sudan&#x27;s first period of military rule.

Abboud lived in Britain for several years and died in Khartoum on 8 September 1983, at the age of 82.

<doc id="1137559" wikidata="Q6504141" url="?curid=1137559" title="Lawrence Heights">
<text>Lawrence Heights is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located north-west of central Toronto, in the district of North York. The neighbourhood is roughly bounded by Lawrence Avenue to the south, Yorkdale Road to the north, Varna Drive to the east and Dufferin Street to the west. It is part of the greater Yorkdale-Glen Park official Toronto neighbourhood.

The area is divided into two distinct subsections. One half of the neighbourhood is a post World War II development of bungalows and storey-and-a-half dwellings. As the frontage of these homes average 45 feet, the area has had significant changes as older houses are torn down and replaced by &quot;Monster Homes&quot; as the area&#x27;s proximity to major city arteries and the downtown core make it lucrative to builders. The other housing area, which is east of Flemington Road, is short-term public housing. Because of the area&#x27;s proximity to Downsview Airport, high-rise buildings were not originally permitted to be constructed in this area, and the majority of the housing is in low to mid-rise buildings.

==History==
Lawrence Heights was the first large public housing project built by Metropolitan Toronto outside of the then-City of Toronto and is now managed under Toronto Community Housing. By 1955, had been assembled by Metro. The project would have approximately 6,000 residents in 1,081 family units at a density of 12 families per acre, the largest public housing project to that date in Canada. When the project was announced, it sparked a strong opposition from the then North York Township. Citizens and elected officials threatened legal action to block the development. A compromise was worked out between Metro and North York whereby some of the units would be rented at market rates so that the project would not be exclusively very poor families.
Construction was completed by 1962. It consisted mainly of row houses and maisonettes with some small apartment buildings of less than 30 units each. A buffer of single-family dwellings was built between the project and the private sub-division to the east. An elementary school was part of the project. The elementary school filled up immediately and senior elementary students were sent to a neighbouring junior high. A controversy erupted over the use of the swimming pool at a neighbouring secondary school, whereby project students could only use the pool on one or two evenings per week. A community center was built in the mid-1960s, its $100,000 cost shared by North York and Metro without any support from the Ontario or the federal housing agency Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

Lawrence Heights has been referred to as the &quot;Jungle&quot; by residents and police alike soon after its completion in 1962. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; article &quot;Toronto&#x27;s new murder capital&quot; gives insight into the crime in the area: &quot;It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re in the jungle. It is like a war,&quot; says Linkx, a 20-year-old hip hop producer from nearby Rexdale who wears Crip colours and spoke on condition of anonymity.

In 2007, then city councillor Howard Moscoe unveiled a plan to revitalize Lawrence Heights. The plan proposes a demolition of all 1,208 units in the neighbourhood, as well as Lawrence Square, and they would be replaced by modern affordable units, market housing and retail/commercial streets, including a northward extension of Marlee Avenue. The plan was objected by nearly all surrounding neighbourhood residents due to overcrowding and the added traffic congestion it would bring. As of late 2015, the low rise housing units at Ranee Avenue and Flemington Road (along with a vacant lot) are being demolished for a new condo project (Yorkdale Condos).

In 2015, the city kicked off a large redevelopment project in the area. The aim is to transform one of the city’s largest public housing communities into a mixed-income neighbourhood.

==Education==

The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a secular English first language public school board that operates schools in the neighbourhood. TDSB operates two institutions that offer primary education, Flemington Public School, and Lawrence Heights Middle School; as well as one secondary school, John Polanyi Collegiate Institute. The secondary school is situated in the former building of Bathurst Heights Secondary School, before it was shut down by TDSB. The building was also the temporary site for the public secondary separate school, Brebeuf College School, when Brebeuf underwent restorations. The present secondary school was reopened in 2011.

In addition to TDSB, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) also offer schooling to applicable residents of Lawrence Heights, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood. Applicable students residing in Lawrence Heights attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. CSCM and TCDSB are separate school boards, the former being a French first language school board, the latter being an English first language school board; whereas CSV is a secular French first language school board.

==Recreation==

Several municipal parks are located in Lawrence Heights, including Flemington Park, Ranee Park, Varna Park, and Yorkdale Park. Parks in the neighbourhood are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. In addition to municipal parks, the division also manages a community centre in the neighbourhood, Lawrence Heights Community Centre.

Two large shopping centres in Toronto are also situated in Lawrence Heights, Lawrence Allen Centre, and Yorkdale Shopping Centre, to the north of the neighbourhood.

==Transportation==

Several major roadways serve as the neighbourhood&#x27;s boundaries, with Lawrence Avenue to the south, and Highway 401 to the north. Highway 401 is a major east-west controlled access highway. A portion of another controlled access highway, Allen Road, bisects the neighbourhood.

Public transportation in the neighbourhood is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), including several bus routes, and the Toronto subway. Two stops for Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway are located in the neighbourhood: Lawrence West station and Yorkdale station, located near Yorkdale Shopping Centre. In addition to local TTC bus routes, regional commuter buses operated by GO Transit may be accessed from Yorkdale Bus Terminal. Several other private bus operators can also use the terminal, including Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services.

<doc id="1137568" wikidata="Q1332690" url="?curid=1137568" title="Artificial gravity">
<text>Artificial gravity is the creation of an inertial force that mimics the effects of a gravitational force, usually by rotation. 
Artificial gravity, or rotational gravity, is thus the appearance of a centrifugal force in a rotating frame of reference (the transmission of centripetal acceleration via normal force in the non-rotating frame of reference), as opposed to the force experienced in linear acceleration, which by the equivalence principle is indistinguishable from gravity.
In a more general sense, &quot;artificial gravity&quot; may also refer to the effect of linear acceleration, e.g. by means of a rocket engine.

Rotational simulated gravity has been used in simulations to help astronauts train for extreme conditions. 
Rotational simulated gravity has been proposed as a solution in human spaceflight to the adverse health effects caused by prolonged weightlessness. 
However, there are no current practical outer space applications of artificial gravity for humans due to concerns about the size and cost of a spacecraft necessary to produce a useful centripetal force comparable to the gravitational field strength on Earth (&quot;g&quot;).
Scientists are concerned about the effect of such a system on the inner ear of the occupants. The concern is that using centripetal force to create artificial gravity will cause disturbances in the inner ear leading to nausea and disorientation. The adverse effects may prove intolerable for the occupants.

==Centripetal force==
In the context of a rotating space station, it is the radial force provided by the spacecraft&#x27;s hull that acts as centripetal force. Thus, the &quot;gravity&quot; force felt by an object is the centrifugal force perceived in the rotating frame of reference as pointing &quot;downwards&quot; towards the hull.

By Newton&#x27;s Third Law, the value of little &quot;g&quot; (the perceived &quot;downward&quot; acceleration) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the centripetal acceleration. It was tested with satellites like Bion 3 (1975) and Bion 4 (1977); they both had centrifuges on board to put some specimens in an artificial gravity environment.

===Differences from normal gravity===
From the perspective of people rotating with the habitat, artificial gravity by rotation behaves similarly to normal gravity but with the following differences, which can be mitigated by increasing the radius of a space station.
* Centrifugal force varies with distance: Unlike real gravity, the apparent force felt by observers in the habitat pushes radially outward from the axis, and the centrifugal force is directly proportional to the distance from the axis of the habitat. With a small radius of rotation, a standing person&#x27;s head would feel significantly less gravity than their feet. Likewise, passengers who move in a space station experience changes in apparent weight in different parts of the body.
* The Coriolis effect gives an apparent force that acts on objects that are moving relative to a rotating reference frame. This apparent force acts at right angles to the motion and the rotation axis and tends to curve the motion in the opposite sense to the habitat&#x27;s spin. If an astronaut inside a rotating artificial gravity environment moves towards or away from the axis of rotation, they will feel a force pushing them in or against the direction of spin. These forces act on the semicircular canals of the inner ear and can cause dizziness. Lengthening the period of rotation (lower spin rate) reduces the Coriolis force and its effects. It is generally believed that at 2 rpm or less, no adverse effects from the Coriolis forces will occur, although humans have been shown to adapt to rates as high as 23 rpm.
* Changes in the rotation axis or rate of a spin would cause a disturbance in the artificial gravity field and stimulate the semicircular canals (refer to above). Any movement of mass within the station, including a movement of people, would shift the axis and could potentially cause a dangerous wobble. Thus, the rotation of a space station would need to be adequately stabilized, and any operations to deliberately change the rotation would need to be done slowly enough to be imperceptible. One possible solution to prevent the station from wobbling would be to use its liquid water supply as ballast which could be pumped between different sections of the station as required. 

===Human spaceflight===
The Gemini 11 mission attempted in 1966 to produce artificial gravity by rotating the capsule around the Agena Target Vehicle to which it was attached by a 36-meter tether. They were able to generate a small amount of artificial gravity, about 0.00015 &quot;g&quot;, by firing their side thrusters to slowly rotate the combined craft like a slow-motion pair of bolas. The resultant force was too small to be felt by either astronaut, but objects were observed moving towards the &quot;floor&quot; of the capsule.

==== Health benefits ====

Artificial gravity has been suggested as a solution to various health risks associated with spaceflight. In 1964, the Soviet space program believed that a human could not survive more than 14 days in space for fear that the heart and blood vessels would be unable to adapt to the weightless conditions. This fear was eventually discovered to be unfounded as spaceflights have now lasted up to 437 consecutive days, with missions aboard the International Space Station commonly lasting 6 months. However, the question of human safety in space did launch an investigation into the physical effects of prolonged exposure to weightlessness. In June 1991, the Spacelab Life Sciences 1 on the Space Shuttle flight STS-40 flight performed 18 experiments on two men and two women over nine days. In an environment without gravity, it was concluded that the response of white blood cells and muscle mass decreased. Additionally, within the first 24 hours spent in a weightless environment, blood volume decreased by 10%. Long weightless periods can cause brain swelling and eyesight problems. Upon return to Earth, the effects of prolonged weightlessness continue to affect the human body as fluids pool back to the lower body, the heart rate rises, a drop in blood pressure occurs, and there is a reduced tolerance for exercise.

Artificial gravity, for its ability to mimic the behavior of gravity on the human body, has been suggested as one of the most encompassing manners of combating the physical effects inherent in weightless environments. Other measures that have been suggested as symptomatic treatments include exercise, diet, and Pingvin suits. However, criticism of those methods lies in the fact that they do not fully eliminate health problems and require a variety of solutions to address all issues. Artificial gravity, in contrast, would remove the weightlessness inherent in space travel. By implementing artificial gravity, space travelers would never have to experience weightlessness or the associated side effects. Especially in a modern-day six-month journey to Mars, exposure to artificial gravity is suggested in either a continuous or intermittent form to prevent extreme debilitation to the astronauts during travel.

====Proposals====

Several proposals have incorporated artificial gravity into their design:
* Discovery II: a 2005 vehicle proposal capable of delivering a 172-metric-ton crew to Jupiter&#x27;s orbit in 118 days. A very small portion of the 1,690-metric-ton craft would incorporate a centrifugal crew station.
* Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV): a 2011 NASA proposal for a long-duration crewed space transport vehicle; it included a rotational artificial gravity space habitat intended to promote crew health for a crew of up to six persons on missions of up to two years in duration. The torus-ring centrifuge would utilize both standard metal-frame and inflatable spacecraft structures and would provide 0.11 to 0.69 &quot;g&quot; if built with the diameter option.
* ISS Centrifuge Demo: a 2011 NASA proposal for a demonstration project preparatory to the final design of the larger torus centrifuge space habitat for the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle. The structure would have an outside diameter of with a ring interior cross-section diameter of . It would provide 0.08 to 0.51 &quot;g&quot; partial gravity. This test and evaluation centrifuge would have the capability to become a Sleep Module for the ISS crew.

* Mars Direct: A plan for a crewed Mars mission created by NASA engineers Robert Zubrin and David Baker in 1990, later expanded upon in Zubrin&#x27;s 1996 book &quot;The Case for Mars&quot;. The &quot;Mars Habitat Unit&quot;, which would carry astronauts to Mars to join the previously launched &quot;Earth Return Vehicle&quot;, would have had artificial gravity generated during flight by tying the spent upper stage of the booster to the Habitat Unit, and setting them both rotating about a common axis.
* The proposed Tempo3 mission rotates two halves of a spacecraft connected by a tether to test the feasibility of simulating gravity on a crewed mission to Mars.
* The Mars Gravity Biosatellite was a proposed mission meant to study the effect of artificial gravity on mammals. An artificial gravity field of 0.38 &quot;g&quot; (equivalent to Mars&#x27;s surface gravity) was to be produced by rotation (32 rpm, radius of ca. 30  cm). Fifteen mice would have orbited Earth (Low Earth orbit) for five weeks and then land alive. However, the program was canceled on 24 June 2009, due to a lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA.
* Vast Space is a private company that proposes to build the world&#x27;s first artificial gravity space station using the rotating spacecraft concept.
* A Mars gravity simulator could be built on the Moon to prepare for Mars missions. The surface gravity of Mars is somewhat more than twice that of the Moon. It has been proposed to build a large low-pressure bubble, and within it up to twenty higher-pressure rotating tori, all within a cave or lava tube. An analogous system could be built on Mars to prepare people to return to Earth, whose surface gravity is more than twice that of Mars.

==== Issues with implementation ====
Some of the reasons that artificial gravity remains unused today in spaceflight trace back to the problems inherent in implementation. One of the realistic methods of creating artificial gravity is the centrifugal effect caused by the centripetal force of the floor of a rotating structure pushing up on the person. In that model, however, issues arise in the size of the spacecraft. As expressed by John Page and Matthew Francis, the smaller a spacecraft (the shorter the radius of rotation), the more rapid the rotation that is required. As such, to simulate gravity, it would be better to utilize a larger spacecraft that rotates slowly. 

The requirements on size about rotation are due to the differing forces on parts of the body at different distances from the axis of rotation. If parts of the body closer to the rotational axis experience a force that is significantly different from parts farther from the axis, then this could have adverse effects. Additionally, questions remain as to what the best way is to initially set the rotating motion in place without disturbing the stability of the whole spacecraft&#x27;s orbit. At the moment, there is not a ship massive enough to meet the rotation requirements, and the costs associated with building, maintaining, and launching such a craft are extensive.

In general, with the small number of negative health effects present in today&#x27;s typically shorter spaceflights, as well as with the very large cost of research for a technology which is not yet really needed, the present day development of artificial gravity technology has necessarily been stunted and sporadic. 

As the length of typical space flights increases, the need for artificial gravity for the passengers in such lengthy spaceflights will most certainly also increase, and so will the knowledge and resources available to create such artificial gravity, most likely also increase. In summary, it is probably only a question of time, as to how long it might take before the conditions are suitable for the completion of the development of artificial gravity technology, which will almost certainly be required at some point along with the eventual and inevitable development of an increase in the average length of a spaceflight.

====In science fiction====
Several science fiction novels, films, and series have featured artificial gravity production.

* In the movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, a rotating centrifuge in the &quot;Discovery&quot; spacecraft provides artificial gravity. 
* The 1999 television series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, a rotating ring in the &quot;Bebop&quot; spacecraft creates artificial gravity throughout the spacecraft.
* In the novel &quot;The Martian&quot;, the &quot;Hermes&quot; spacecraft achieves artificial gravity by design; it employs a ringed structure, at whose periphery forces around 40% of Earth&#x27;s gravity are experienced, similar to Mars&#x27; gravity.
** In the novel &quot;Project Hail Mary&quot; by the same author, weight on the titular ship &quot;Hail Mary&quot; is provided initially by engine thrust, as the ship is capable of constant acceleration up to and is also able to separate, turn the crew compartment inwards, and rotate to produce while in orbit.
* The movie &quot;Interstellar&quot; features a spacecraft called the &quot;Endurance&quot; that can rotate on its central axis to create artificial gravity, controlled by retro thrusters on the ship.
* The 2021 film &quot;Stowaway&quot; features the upper stage of a launch vehicle connected by 450-meter long tethers to the ship&#x27;s main hull, acting as a counterweight for inertia-based artificial gravity.
* In the television series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, the space hotel &quot;Polaris&quot;, later renamed &quot;Phoenix&quot; after being purchased and converted into a space vessel by Helios Aerospace for their own Mars mission, features a wheel-like structure controlled by thrusters to create artificial gravity, whilst a central axial hub operates in zero gravity as a docking station.

==Linear acceleration==

Linear acceleration is another method of generating artificial gravity, by using the thrust from a spacecraft&#x27;s engines to create the illusion of being under a gravitational pull. A spacecraft under constant acceleration in a straight line would have the appearance of a gravitational pull in the direction opposite to that of the acceleration, as the thrust from the engines would cause the spacecraft to &quot;push&quot; itself up into the objects and persons inside of the vessel, thus creating the feeling of weight. This is because of Newton&#x27;s third law: the weight that one would feel standing in a linearly accelerating spacecraft would not be a true gravitational pull, but simply the reaction of oneself pushing against the craft&#x27;s hull as it pushes back. Similarly, objects that would otherwise be free-floating within the spacecraft if it were not accelerating would &quot;fall&quot; towards the engines when it started accelerating, as a consequence of Newton&#x27;s first law: the floating object would remain at rest, while the spacecraft would accelerate towards it, and appear to an observer within that the object was &quot;falling&quot;.

To emulate artificial gravity on Earth, spacecraft using linear acceleration gravity may be built similar to a skyscraper, with its engines as the bottom &quot;floor&quot;. If the spacecraft were to accelerate at the rate of 1 &quot;g&quot;—Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull—the individuals inside would be pressed into the hull at the same force, and thus be able to walk and behave as if they were on Earth.

This form of artificial gravity is desirable because it could functionally create the illusion of a gravity field that is uniform and unidirectional throughout a spacecraft, without the need for large, spinning rings, whose fields may not be uniform, not unidirectional with respect to the spacecraft, and require constant rotation. This would also have the advantage of relatively high speed: a spaceship accelerating at 1 &quot;g&quot;, 9.8 m/s2, for the first half of the journey, and then decelerating for the other half, could reach Mars within a few days. Similarly, a hypothetical space travel using constant acceleration of 1 &quot;g&quot; for one year would reach relativistic speeds and allow for a round trip to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri. As such, low-impulse but long-term linear acceleration has been proposed for various interplanetary missions. For example, even heavy (100 ton) cargo payloads to Mars could be transported to Mars in and retain approximately 55 percent of the LEO vehicle mass upon arrival into a Mars orbit, providing a low-gravity gradient to the spacecraft during the entire journey.

This form of gravity is not without challenges, however. At present, the only practical engines that could propel a vessel fast enough to reach speeds comparable to Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull require chemical reaction rockets, which expel reaction mass to achieve thrust, and thus the acceleration could only last for as long as a vessel had fuel. The vessel would also need to be constantly accelerating and at a constant speed to maintain the gravitational effect, and thus would not have gravity while stationary, and could experience significant swings in &quot;g&quot;-forces if the vessel were to accelerate above or below 1 &quot;g&quot;. Further, for point-to-point journeys, such as Earth-Mars transits, vessels would need to constantly accelerate for half the journey, turn off their engines, perform a 180° flip, reactivate their engines, and then begin decelerating towards the target destination, requiring everything inside the vessel to experience weightlessness and possibly be secured down for the duration of the flip.

A propulsion system with a very high specific impulse (that is, good efficiency in the use of reaction mass that must be carried along and used for propulsion on the journey) could accelerate more slowly producing useful levels of artificial gravity for long periods of time. A variety of electric propulsion systems provide examples. Two examples of this long-duration, low-thrust, high-impulse propulsion that have either been practically used on spacecraft or are planned in for near-term in-space use are Hall effect thrusters and Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rockets (VASIMR). Both provide very high specific impulse but relatively low thrust, compared to the more typical chemical reaction rockets. They are thus ideally suited for long-duration firings which would provide limited amounts of, but long-term, milli-&quot;g&quot; levels of artificial gravity in spacecraft.

In a number of science fiction plots, acceleration is used to produce artificial gravity for interstellar spacecraft, propelled by as yet theoretical or hypothetical means.

This effect of linear acceleration is well understood, and is routinely used for 0 &quot;g&quot; cryogenic fluid management for post-launch (subsequent) in-space firings of upper stage rockets.

Roller coasters, especially launched roller coasters or those that rely on electromagnetic propulsion, can provide linear acceleration &quot;gravity&quot;, and so can relatively high acceleration vehicles, such as sports cars. Linear acceleration can be used to provide air-time on roller coasters and other thrill rides.

==Simulating lunar gravity==

In January 2022, China was reported by the South China Morning Post to have built a small ( diameter) research facility to simulate low lunar gravity with the help of magnets. The facility was reportedly partly inspired by the work of Andre Geim (who later shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on graphene) and Michael Berry, who both shared the Ig Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for the magnetic levitation of a frog.

==Graviton control or generator==
==Speculative or fictional mechanisms==
In science fiction, artificial gravity (or cancellation of gravity) or &quot;paragravity&quot; is sometimes present in spacecraft that are neither rotating nor accelerating. At present, there is no confirmed technique as such that can simulate gravity other than actual rotation or acceleration. There have been many claims over the years of such a device. Eugene Podkletnov, a Russian engineer, has claimed since the early 1990s to have made such a device consisting of a spinning superconductor producing a powerful &quot;gravitomagnetic field.&quot; In 2006, a research group funded by ESA claimed to have created a similar device that demonstrated positive results for the production of gravitomagnetism, although it produced only 0.0001 &quot;g&quot;.

<text>Bride and Prejudice (also known as Bride and Prejudice: The Bollywood Musical) is a 2004 romantic comedy-drama film directed by Gurinder Chadha. The screenplay by Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges is a Bollywood-style adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s 1813 novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Shot primarily in English, with some Hindi and Punjabi dialogue, the film was released in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2004 and in the United States on 11 February 2005 to mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Lalita Bakshi is a young woman living in Amritsar, India with her family. The family is invited to a friend&#x27;s wedding ceremony, where Lalita meets Will Darcy, a handsome and wealthy American who is a long-time friend of the Indian-British barrister Balraj, and Balraj&#x27;s sister Kiran. Balraj is instantly attracted to Lalita&#x27;s eldest sister Jaya and likewise, Darcy is attracted to Lalita. During the wedding reception, Lalita takes a disliking to Darcy but when Balraj invites Jaya to Goa, Mr. Bakshi asks Lalita to go with them and she eventually agrees to do so. In Goa, Lalita and Darcy clash over their ideas on men and women and India&#x27;s economic future. Later that night on the beach, Lalita meets Johnny Wickham, Darcy&#x27;s former friend from London, and he validates her low opinion of Darcy.

The Bakshi family is visited by Kohli Saab, a family friend living in Los Angeles, who has come to India to find a &quot;traditional woman&quot; to marry. When Kohli Saab is attracted to Jaya, Mrs. Bakshi steers him towards Lalita, making Lalita uncomfortable. Wickham is invited to join the family and Kohli Saab at the Garba, despite Mrs. Bakshi&#x27;s disapproval. Lalita happily accepts a dance from Wickham, even as Darcy and Kiran warn her against becoming involved with him. Lalita angers her mother by turning down a proposal from Kohli.

Balraj, Kiran, and Darcy are invited to the Bakshi house for dinner, where Jaya and Lalita&#x27;s younger sister Maya performs an awkward snake dance for the guests. Mrs. Bakshi furthers her guests&#x27; discomfort by commenting loudly on Balraj and Jaya&#x27;s impending engagement and future babies.

Balraj comes to the house the following day to bid farewell to Jaya and promises to write to her from London. Youngest sister Lakhi Bakshi later announces that Lalita&#x27;s friend Chandra is marrying Kohli Saab, much to the surprise of Jaya and especially Lalita. The same night, Wickham also announces that he is leaving and promises to write to Lalita. Neither Balraj nor Wickham writes to the two older sisters, but Wickham is shown secretly writing to Lakhi. Kohli Saab and Chandra phone to invite the Bakshi family the wedding ceremony in Los Angeles. The family accepts and Jaya is excited to stopover in London hoping to see Balraj again.

In London, Kiran informs the Bakshi family that Balraj is in New York to meet potential brides, devastating Jaya, Lalita and Mrs Bakshi. At Heathrow Airport, Lakhi, Jaya, Lalita and Mrs Bakshi coincidentally run into Darcy, who is also a guest at Kohli Saab and Chandra&#x27;s wedding. On board Darcy offers his First class seat to Mrs. Bakshi so he can sit next to Lalita in Economy class for the remainder of the flight. During their stay in California, Lalita&#x27;s opinion of Darcy slowly improves, and the two fall in love.

At the wedding, Darcy&#x27;s condescending mother, Catherine, introduces Lalita to Darcy&#x27;s former girlfriend, Anne who mispronounces Lalita&#x27;s name as &quot;Lolita&quot;. Jaya and Lalita also meet Darcy&#x27;s younger sister, Georgie, who tells Lalita that Balraj and Darcy are not in contact because Darcy persuaded Balraj not to marry an Indian girl with a &quot;gold-digger&quot; Mother. Lalita furiously realizes that Darcy is the reason why Jaya never heard from Balraj. Darcy proposes to Lalita, who angrily refuses, blaming him for Jaya&#x27;s unhappiness.

Back in London, Lakhi uses the family&#x27;s layover as an opportunity to sneak away and meet Wickham. Darcy apologizes to Lalita, telling her that he has gotten Balraj to reconcile with Jaya. Lalita realizes that Darcy was right about Wickham and calls for his help to find Lakhi. Darcy explains that Wickham got Georgie pregnant at age 16, tried to marry her for their family&#x27;s money, and ran away when his plan did not work. They both rescue Lakhi and Lalita accepts Darcy&#x27;s proposal. The film ends with a double wedding of Jaya to Balraj and Lalita to Darcy.

Ashanti sings &quot;Touch My Body&quot; and Gayatri Iyer sings &quot;Take Me to Love&quot; in the film. According to director Gurinder Chadha in &quot;making-of&quot; extras on the DVD release, Ashanti&#x27;s appearance is an homage to the tradition of a celebrity making a cameo appearance to sing an &quot;item number&quot;, a song that has no direct involvement in the plot in Bollywood films.

==Critical reception==
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 64% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A colorful and energetic adaptation of Austen&#x27;s classic.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Peter Bradshaw from &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewed, &quot;&quot;Bride and Prejudice&quot; could be any unremarkable Bollywood picture&quot;. Stella Papamichael at the BBC noted that &quot;swapping corsets for saris, and polite pianoforte for the bhangra beat, director Gurinder Chadha reinvigorates Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; with fun and flamboyance&quot;.

<text>The Walter Carsen Centre for The National Ballet of Canada is a building at 470 Queens Quay West on the waterfront in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The lower levels house the headquarters of the National Ballet of Canada and the ballet&#x27;s rehearsal space. The facility has 8,825 square metres of space, more than the Four Seasons Centre where the ballet performs. Previously the ballet had been based at St. Lawrence Hall and scattered other buildings through the downtown core. Built in 1995, it was named to honour patron of the arts Walter Carsen who donated towards its construction.

The centre is inside the King&#x27;s Landing luxury condominium building. This structure was completed in 1984, and designed by Arthur Erickson. The 320 unit building was one of the first condominiums to be built in the former industrial region along the lake shore. The lower levels were always intended to be arts space, linked to the Harbourfront facility. Various proposals, including locating the Bata Shoe Museum in the space fell through, and the vast space remained empty and unfinished until the ballet moved there.

<doc id="1137600" wikidata="Q5182500" url="?curid=1137600" title="York Region Transit">
<text>York Region Transit (YRT) is the public transit operator in York Region, Ontario, Canada. Its headquarters are in Richmond Hill, at 50 High Tech Road.

YRT operates 65 full-time rush hour and limited routes, 35 school services, and six Viva bus rapid transit routes. Five contracted Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus routes run within York Region&#x27;s boundaries (one in Vaughan and four in Markham).

Some YRT routes operate within the City of Toronto; these buses generally run to and from TTC subway stations. YRT northbound buses are allowed to pick up passengers south of Steeles Avenue if they are heading into York Region (passengers must flag the bus from a designated TTC or YRT stop). YRT buses heading to a TTC subway station can similarly drop off passengers at designated stops south of Steeles Avenue but are not permitted to pick up passengers from these stops. As the majority of passengers are assumed to be transferring to and from TTC services, no extra fare is charged for riders boarding or disembarking YRT buses within Toronto.

==Ridership==
In the fourth quarter of 2022, average weekday ridership was approximately 64,800 on buses and 1,200 on MobilityPlus, a service for people with disabilities. 22.8 million riders used YRT in 2016, a 1.4% increase over 2015.

==History==

Prior to the inauguration of YRT in 2001, public transit in York Region (York County prior to 1971) was delivered by a patchwork of various operators in some of the lower-tier municipalities, with some cross-boundary services in more heavily urbanized areas. Most of the cross-boundary service was either GO Transit running &quot;city&quot;-type bus routes or the present TTC-contracted routes (with some being replaced with YRT routes or cancelled) coming north from Metropolitan Toronto or later (and present) Toronto. Gray Coach also provided some medium-distance commuter services.

===Former inter-municipal services===
Stagecoaches or omnibuses ran along Yonge Street to hotels in Richmond Hill from York (now Toronto) beginning in the 1820s. The Metropolitan Street Railway ran electric interurban streetcars on Yonge Street as far north as Keswick from 1897 to 1930. Publicly owned (via TTC) North Yonge Railways provided interurban service on Yonge Street from 1930 to 1948. 

From 1948 to 1977, the Toronto Transit Commission (Toronto Transportation Commission before 1954) ran the North Yonge 59 bus route on Yonge. Other contracted TTC routes later followed on many other streets continuing from Metro Toronto. The North Yonge bus was replaced by GO Transit–operated Yonge C and B bus routes, with C providing local suburban bus service to Richmond Hill, and B providing service all the way to Newmarket until being replaced in turn by Viva Blue in 2010. Another local C route, starting in 1972, ran on Bayview Avenue as far as Richmond Hill.

===Former local services===
Before the 1970s, several private and public transit operators provided local transit services around York Region communities: These services were later replaced by the following municipally managed transit systems, with the earlier operators continuing to operate the new systems in some cases (the history of these predecessor local services are also described for each municipality). 

====Markham Transit====
Markham Transit was created in 1973 and operated by Travelways and Miller Transit Limited after 1984 on behalf of the then–Town of Markham. 

====Richmond Hill Transit====
Richmond Hill Transit was created in 1960 to provide public transit service in Richmond Hill. It was initially operated by Trailways of Canada Limited, then Travelways starting in 1976 and Laidlaw in the 1980s.

====Vaughan Transit====
Vaughan Transit operated from 1973 until the merger into YRT. Before (and for two years after) the creation of Vaughan Transit, transit service was provided to the community of [[Woodbridge, Ontario|Woodbridge] by the TTC-operated 93 Woodbridge bus between 1954 and 1975. Prior to that, various private operators provided a similar service, starting in 1925. Even earlier, an interurban line served Woodbridge between 1913 and 1926. 

====Newmarket Transit====
[[Newmarket Transit]] began sometime in the early 1970s as a contracted service from the town. Previously service was provide first by Newmarket Bus Lines circa 1948, renamed Newmarket Town Bus circa 1958, which ran to 1967.

====Aurora====
[[Aurora Transit]] began operations in 1973, replacing Aurora Bus lines, which operated starting in the 1960s. Like Newmarket, Aurora was much smaller in size and population than other southern York Region municipalities, which benefited from connections to [[GO Transit]] and the TTC. Aurora Transit provided feeder service to GO Transit&#x27;s commuter trains and buses as well as community bus service to town&#x27;s major destinations.

A fare arrangement between Aurora Transit and GO Transit allowed passengers to use Aurora Transit tickets on GO Transit&#x27;s &quot;Route B&quot; buses that provided local service on Yonge Street, provided the entire trip was within Aurora&#x27;s town limits. Passengers travelling to the neighbouring [[Oak Ridges, Ontario|Oak Ridges]] or Newmarket could still use Aurora Transit tickets with a cash supplement.

On August 30, 1998, Aurora Transit restructured its services into a single route with service in the southern part of the town provided by Richmond Hill Transit. At the same time, Newmarket Transit route 77/11 was extended south on Bayview Avenue to connect with Aurora Transit&#x27;s only route at Bayview Shopping Centre. Aurora Transit ended its operations on September 4, 1999, when the transit service in the town was transferred to Newmarket Transit. The latter became part of the York Region Transit on January 1, 2001, when the four regional transit systems were merged.

===Creation of YRT===
YRT was created by the regional government in 2001 by amalgamating the four municipal transit authorities in the region as increasing urbanization made separate municipal transit agencies impractical. Viva was inaugurated in 2005. 

In mid-2006, the YRT logo was modified to bear closer resemblance to the Viva logo and, by the end of the year, most of the YRT fleet and bus stop signs had their looks changed to bear the new colours.

==Operations==
Transit services in York Region are divided into four divisions and are provided by private operators under contract.

===Viva BRT Division===
The [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) division operates the six [[Viva Rapid Transit]] bus routes and uses the 196-bus garage near Leslie Street and 16th Avenue in Richmond Hill. In 2015, [[TOK Transit]] began a seven-year contract, replacing Veolia Transportation ([[Transdev]]) as operator.

=== North Division ===
The North Division includes several bus routes in [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]], [[Aurora, Ontario|Aurora]], [[King, Ontario|King Township]], [[East Gwillimbury, Ontario|East Gwillimbury]] and [[Georgina, Ontario|Georgina]]. TOK Transit also operates this division and is under contract until April 30, 2021.

=== Southeast Division ===
The Southeast Division includes routes in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], and [[Whitchurch-Stouffville|Stouffville]]. It is operated by [[Miller Transit Limited|Miller Transit]] who are under contract until October 2023.

=== Southwest Division ===
Transdev Canada is under contract of this division until August 1, 2021.

==Bus rapid transit==
In response to escalating congestion on the region&#x27;s roads, York Region&#x27;s transit plan included a provision for a bus rapid transit system along the [[York Regional Road 1|Yonge Street]] and [[York Regional Road 7|Highway 7]] arterial corridors. This service, known as &quot;Viva&quot;, was launched in September 2005.

==Fares==
Fares for riding YRT can be paid by cash, [[Presto card]], or the mobile Presto E-Tickets app. Customers can also pay the equivalent of the YRT adult cash fare prices via contactless credit or debit card. YRT discontinued the sale and use of monthly passes from January 2024 onwards. They were replaced by a monthly fare capping system only available on the Presto card.

, YRT fares are as follows: 

Other fares:
Two separate methods of payments are used by transit routes serving York Region:
*&quot;Pay as you board&quot; on conventional YRT and TTC-operated bus routes.
*&quot;[[Proof of payment]]&quot; basis on all Viva routes (customers may board or disembark at any door)

York Region&#x27;s rapid transit bus service, Viva, operates on a &quot;pre-paid proof-of-payment (POP)&quot; system, meaning passengers in possession of POP can board these buses at any door. Unlike conventional YRT buses, Viva buses are not equipped with onboard fare boxes, which means passengers are required to purchase single-ride tickets from curbside fare vending machines; or use a Presto card, or contactless credit or debit card, on the YRT Presto fare readers located beside the fare vending machines; or activate their mobile ticket or pass at the platforms prior to boarding. A single-ride ticket has the date and expiry time printed on it at the time of purchase and does not need to be validated.

Paper POP tickets and transfers are not issued to Presto, credit and debit card holders users since these payment methods act as POP. Time-based fares and transfers allow for unlimited travel within York Region on a single fare for two hours, including transfers to and from [[Brampton Transit]], [[Züm]], as well as TTC-operated bus routes in York Region (north of Steeles Avenue). 

Since February 26, 2024, under the One Fare Program, a Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA)–wide fare integration policy, passengers paying by Presto card, credit card or debit card are eligible for free transfers between YRT and the TTC subway and bus routes in the City Of Toronto (south of Steeles Avenue) within 2 hours of initial fare payment. However, customers paying by other means are not eligible for the One Fare program and are still required to pay an additional fare when transferring between YRT and the TTC subway and when crossing Steeles on a TTC bus in either direction. 

===Former fare zones===
On July 1, 2017, YRT removed fare zones, allowing customers to travel within the region for only one fare. Previously, the YRT/Viva service area was divided into three fare zones. Zone 3 was defined as the portion of York Region north of [[Ravenshoe Road]], and Zones 1 and 2 were divided by [[Bloomington Road]] for northbound passengers, just south of King Road for southbound passengers. Passengers crossing a zone boundary had to pay a zone fare supplement in addition to the regular fares.

===GO Transit co-fares===
As with many other transit agencies within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, YRT offers free transfers between YRT or Viva buses and [[GO Transit]] under its &quot;Ride to GO&quot; program. Passengers may transfer from a GO Transit route to a YRT bus route or TTC-operated bus routes in York Region (north of Steeles Avenue) and receive free admission onto YRT so long as the passenger provides the GO Transit proof of payment ticket. Since Viva is operated on a proof-of-purchase system and single Viva fares are paid or purchased at curbside fare vending machines, riders must use a Presto card when transferring between Viva and GO Transit services in order to access the Ride to GO co-fare discount.

The GO Transit co-fare discount is available to all passengers who pay single YRT bus fares on their stored Presto card balance: passengers will automatically be assessed the co-fare (and any YRT or Viva fare supplements, if necessary) when transferring from GO Transit to YRT/Viva services regardless of where the passenger boards the YRT bus. Similarly, passengers transferring from YRT/Viva to GO Transit services will also be reimbursed the difference between the YRT fare and the co-fare upon disembarking from GO Transit (effectively, the YRT portion of the journey is paid with a co-fare).

===TTC services in York Region===
====Buses==== 
Some TTC bus routes travel into York Region and operate on behalf of YRT. This allows passengers to board a TTC bus in York Region and disembark in the City of Toronto and vice versa.

Passengers who board such routes in Toronto pay a TTC fare, while those boarding in York Region pay a YRT fare.

Since August 26, 2019, riders have been able to use their Presto card to pay both their YRT and TTC fares on TTC-operated bus routes that travel between York Region and Toronto. While single-use TTC-only paper [[Presto card#Presto ticket|Presto tickets]] can be used to pay a TTC fare for the subway (whether in York Region or Toronto) or TTC surface routes in Toronto, they cannot be used to pay a YRT fare on YRT- and TTC-operated bus routes in York Region.

Certain YRT routes enter Toronto, but City of Toronto regulations mean that passengers may not board inbound (towards Toronto) or disembark on outbound (away from Toronto) YRT routes in Toronto. No extra fare is charged for travel solely on YRT vehicles in Toronto.

====Subway====
On December 17, 2017, the western branch of Line 1 was extended into York Region. Coinciding with that opening, YRT took over the operation of four TTC-operated routes in Vaughan. Unlike the policy with TTC-operated bus routes in York, no extra fare was ever charged when boarding or disembarking at and [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station|Vaughan Metropolitan Centre]] stations in [[Vaughan, Ontario|Vaughan]], due to the impracticality of a payment-on-exit system. Under the fare integration policy, riders using card payment can transfer between YRT and TTC services within two hours of initial payment, with the additional fare for cash payment still required when transferring between YRT bus routes and the subway at these stations, as it is at stations located in or bordering Toronto, such as or as well as with connecting TTC bus routes operating in Toronto.

===Brampton Transit fares in York Region===

An agreement between YRT and [[Brampton Transit]] means passengers boarding [[Züm Queen]] east of [[Ontario Highway 50|Highway 50]] (which largely duplicates service with [[Viva Orange]] while in York Region) will be assessed YRT fares even if they intend to disembark in Brampton. As a Brampton Transit route, Brampton Transit fare media (including those loaded onto a Presto card) may be used to board without any additional fares being assessed. However, despite the fare integration, passengers boarding with YRT passes will not be issued transfers for connecting to Brampton Transit routes in Brampton, and passengers boarding with Brampton Transit passes will not be issued transfers for connecting to YRT routes in York Region.

Brampton Transit and YRT have cooperated on routes connecting Brampton and Toronto via York Region, and for a time, certain YRT routes were jointly operated by YRT and Brampton Transit buses, where both agencies&#x27; fare media were accepted. The introduction of Züm Queen has ended operation of YRT route 77 to [[Bramalea City Centre]]. The acceptance of YRT fares on Brampton Transit routes in York Region are the last vestiges of such cooperation.

==Vehicles and fleet rosters==

YRT has 123 Viva bus rapid transit vehicles, 406 York Region Transit buses, and 97 Mobility Plus vehicles. The initial fleet consisted of buses from previous York Region operators, but has since been expanded with YRT-bought vehicles.

===Fleet colours===
YRT&#x27;s first fleet (2001–2006) was painted with a white base with blue and gold stripes. During the agency&#x27;s early years, many buses still sported the pre-2000 colours of their previous operators, with &quot;YRT&quot; painted on the front and sides. The livery was changed in 2007 to white and several tones of blue. Only the Viva fleet is all-blue, but one Orion I YRT (#2028) was painted all-blue for a colour demo. During the transition to the second colour theme, some buses were all white with the old &quot;YRT&quot; label remaining.

==Transit enforcement==

Fare inspectors and [[Special constable|special constables]] patrol the entire YRT transit system for the safety and security of passengers and to ensure compliance with the [[proof-of-payment]] system used on Viva buses. They do random spot checks on board Viva buses to ensure the proper use of tickets, transfers and Presto cards. There is a time limit to be riding while paying one fare, and passengers without valid fares (even those whose two-hour travel window expires while on board a vehicle) are subject to a warning, fine, or a criminal charge.

===CCTV cameras===
In 2006, YRT began installing 150 cameras on YRT (including Viva and Mobility Plus) buses. By the end of 2008, there were to be 210 more cameras added to the system&#x27;s vehicles. CCTV cameras are also installed in some of the Vivastations in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]].

==2011–2012 labour strike==
Starting on October 24, 2011, bus drivers and workers contracted by Miller Transit, First Student and York BRT Services (Veolia) started striking, protesting over wages and benefits for three months. Over 60 percent of YRT bus routes in York region and all Viva routes did not operate. YRT and Viva workers started picketing on December 5, 2011, at Finch-GO Terminal, YRT headquarters, South-West Division Garage, and Richmond Hill Centre Terminal. 96% of all YRT/Viva routes returned to service on February 4, 2012, and 98% of services were operational by February 6, 2012. Full YRT/Viva service resumed on February 27, 2012. To compensate riders for the three months of service disruptions, York Region Transit provided two months of free service, using the money saved by not having to pay striking workers.

==Officers==
In December 2014, the executive of YRT consisted of:
* Chair: Wayne Emmerson (as York Region chair)
* Vice-chair (regional councillor): [[Dave Barrow]]

<text>The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF, ; Jawi: ) was formed on 2 June 1958 as the Royal Federation of Malaya Air Force (; ). However, its roots can be traced back to the Malayan Auxiliary Air Force formations of the British Royal Air Force in then-colonial British Malaya. The Royal Malaysian Air Force operates a mix of modern American, European and Russian-made aircraft.

==History==

===Early years===

The Malaysian air forces trace their lineage to the Malayan Auxiliary Air Force formations of the Royal Air Force (RAF) formed in 1934. They later transformed into the Straits Settlements Volunteer Air Force (SSVAF) and the Malayan Volunteers Air Force (MVAF) formed in 1940 and dissolved in 1942 during the height of the Japanese advance over Malaya. The latter was re-established in 1950 in time for the Malayan Emergency and contributed very much to the war effort.

On 2 June 1958 the MVAF finally became the Royal Federation of Malaya Air Force (RFMAF), this date is celebrated as RMAF Day yearly, the Royal title granted by Parliament in honor of its contributions to national defence during the Emergency and the transition to independent status.

On 25 October 1962, after the end of the Malayan Emergency, the RAF handed over their first airfields in Malaya to the RFMAF, at Simpang Airport; it was opened on 1 June 1941, in Sungai Besi, Kuala Lumpur which was formerly part of Selangor and the national capital city. The first aircraft for the fledgling air force was a Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer named &quot;&quot; by the then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. Several Malayans serving with the Royal Air Force transferred to the Royal Federation of Malaya Air Force. The role played by RMAF was limited initially to communications and the support of ground operations against Communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency. RMAF received its first combat aircraft with the delivery of 20 Canadair CL41G Tebuans (an armed version of the Canadair Tutor trainer). RMAF also received Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopters, to be used in the liaison role.

With the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, the name of the air force was changed to &quot;Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia&quot; or &quot;Royal Malaysian Air Force&quot;. New types introduced into service included the Handley Page Herald transport and the De Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou. RMAF received Sikorsky S-61A-4 helicopters in the late 1960s and early 1970s which were used in the transport role. 
RMAF gained an air defence capability when the Australian Government donated 10 ex-Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) CAC Sabre fighters. These were based at the Butterworth Air Base. After the withdrawal of British military forces from Malaysia and Singapore at the end of 1971, a Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) agreement between Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom was concluded to ensure defence against external aggression. The RAAF maintained two Mirage IIIO squadrons at RAF/RAAF Station Butterworth, Butterworth Air Base as part of its commitment to the FPDA. These squadrons were withdrawn in 1986, although occasional deployments of RAAF aircraft continue.

===Modernisation===

With the withdrawal of British military forces, RMAF underwent gradual modernisation from the 1970s to the 1990s. The Sabre were replaced by 16 Northrop F-5E Tiger-IIs. A reconnaissance capability was acquired with the purchase of two RF-5E Tigereye aircraft. RMAF also purchased 88 ex-US Navy Douglas A-4C Skyhawks, of which 40 of the airframes were converted/refurbished by Grumman Aircraft Engineering at Bethpage into the A-4PTM (&#x27;Peculiar To Malaysia&#x27;), configuration (similar to A-4M standard). RMAF has traditionally looked to the West for its purchases, primarily to the United States. However, limitations imposed by the US on &quot;new technology&quot; to the region, such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM fire-and-forget air-to-air missile, has made RMAF consider purchases from Russia and other non-traditional sources. The 1990s saw the arrival of first the BAE Hawk Mk108/208 which replaced the T/A-4PTMs, followed by the MiG-29N/NUB in 1995 in the air superiority role and delivery of the F/A-18D Hornet in 1997 to provide an all weather interdiction capability. In 2003 a contract was signed for 18 Su-30MKMs for delivery in 2007 to fulfill a requirement for an initial order of Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). A requirement for a further 18 MRCAs remains unfulfilled. RMAF is also looking for an AWACS aircraft, although no firm orders have been placed.

On 8 December 2005, four Airbus Military A400M aircraft were ordered to enhance the airlift capability. By March 2017, all Malaysian A400Ms were delivered. In late 2006, the Government signed a contract to purchase eight Aermacchi MB-339CMs to add to the eight MB-339AMs already in service.

In March 2007, then-Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Najib Razak notified the public that the MiG-29 would continue in service until 2010. Later that year, Najib announced the Sikorsky S-61A4 Nuri helicopter, in service since 1968 with 89 crew members killed in 15 accidents, would be phased out by 2012 and replaced by the Eurocopter EC725. Deputy RMAF Chief Lieutenant General Bashir Abu Bakar told the media after opening Heli-Asia 2007, that tender assessment for the replacement of the Sikorsky S-61A-4 Nuri would occur in early 2008. At the 12th Defence Services Asia (DSA) exhibition 2010, a Letter of Agreement (LOA) was signed for 12 EC725 helicopters to be supplied to the RMAF.

The RMAF has multiple ongoing procurement programs for combat, utility and maritime patrol aircraft.

==Chiefs of the Royal Malaysian Air Force==
==Ranks==

Until the late 1970s, the Royal Malaysian Air Force used the same officer ranking system as the Royal Air Force. They were replaced by army-style designations and given Malay title equivalents, but the sleeve insignia remained the same mirroring the RAF practice, but all General Officers wear 1 to 5 stars on the shoulder board in addition to the existing sleeve insignia. The list of ranks which are currently used are shown below (in descending order).
NCOs and enlisted ranks remained unchanged, and retain their pre-1970s names.
All officers, with the exception of the Marshal of the Royal Malaysian Air Force apply the Air Force acronym (RMAF, &quot;TUDM&quot;) to their rank title, to differentiate from their Malaysian Army equivalents. For example, a Colonel in the Air Force would be titled Colonel, RMAF or &quot;Kolonel, TUDM &quot; in Malay.
==Royal Malaysian Air Force regiment==

The RMAF Regiment is the ground and air defence support unit of the RMAF. The regiment is composed of five sub-units tasked with fulfilling the RMAF&#x27;s mission.
These units are:

;PASKAU

The special forces arm of the RMAF is known as PASKAU (a Malay acronym for , which loosely translates as &#x27;Special Air Service&#x27;). PASKAU was formed in response to a mortar attack by the then Communist Party of Malaya on a DHC-4 Caribou in the 1970s at the Kuala Lumpur Air Base. During peacetime, the unit is tasked with responding to aircraft hijacking incidents as well as protecting the country&#x27;s numerous RMAF airbases and civilian airports. Its wartime roles include ground designation, sabotaging of enemy air assets and equipment and the defence of RMAF aircraft and bases. This unit is also deployed for counter-terrorism duties as well as Urban warfare/Close quarters combat.

;HANDAU

HANDAU is the former name given to RMAF special forces PASKAU. HANDAU is presently tasked with on-base security as security troopers. They can be called to any special tasks (notably counter terrorism) along with any armed incidents which may occur on base and can be called to assist RMAF provost officers in handling armed incidents. Their roles are not to be confused with the now PASKAU and the RMAF Provost Unit (which is tasked with upholding military law on base) as they primarily serve as on-ground security combat forces (modelled after the US Air Force Security Forces). HANDAU and PASKAU are now separated into two different units with one serving as a special force of the RMAF and the other as on base security troopers and a ground security combat force. They can be recognised by their standard RMAF berets with the HANDAU cap badge and their vests with the text &quot;HANDAU&quot;.

;RMAF Provost Unit
This is the military police unit of the RMAF regiment, mandated to provide military police duties in RMAF airbases.

;RMAF Infantry
The unit that is equipped with firearms for combat duties. They are tasked as a support element for airforce special forces and are heliborne trained.

;RMAF Ground Air Defence Artillery
This regiment responsible for providing air defense protection by using Ground Base Air Defence (GBAD) to the important places such as airbases as well as RMAF asset.

==Aerobatic team==

The Kris Sakti () is the aerobatic display team of the Royal Malaysian Air Force. It made its debut on 2011 Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition in December 2011. They operated four Extra 300L aircraft.
The Smokey Bandits is the aircraft aerobatic display team under the Royal Malaysian Air Force. This team operates five Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter aircraft and based in RMAF Kuantan. The team&#x27;s name is taken from the smoke emissions from two Russian-made fighter aircraft engines when operating at full thrust. The team was first established in 2001.

==Structure==
As of November 2024 the structure is as follows:
==Air bases==
* TUDM Butterworth, Penang (RMAF Butterworth), (Base of F/A-18 Hornets)
* TUDM Kuantan, Pahang (RMAF Kuantan)
* TUDM Gong Kedak, Kelantan (RMAF Gong Kedak) (Base of Su-30MKMs)
* TUDM Labuan, Sabah (RMAF Labuan) (Base of BAE Hawks)
* TUDM Kuala Lumpur (RMAF Kuala Lumpur)
* TUDM Subang, Selangor (RMAF Subang)
* TUDM Kuching, Sarawak (RMAF Kuching)
* TUDM Alor Setar, Kedah (RMAF Alor Setar) (Air Force College)
* TUDM Ipoh, Perak (RMAF Ipoh) (Air Force School)
* TUDM Bukit Lunchu, Johor (RMAF Bukit Lunchu) (Control and Reporting Post)
* TUDM Kinrara, Selangor (RMAF Kinrara) (School of Logistic Management; also houses a central hospital facility)
* TUDM Jugra, Selangor (RMAF Jugra) (PASKAU headquarters)
* TUDM Bukit Ibam, Pahang (RMAF Bukit Ibam)
* TUDM Sendayan, Negeri Sembilan (RMAF Sendayan) (Military administration centre)

==Equipment==

==Present development==
While the RMAF has traditionally looked to the West for its purchases, primarily the United States and Europe, it has also recently looked to Russia and other non-traditional sources for its modernisation programs.

===Multi-role combat aircraft===

Faced with aging MiG-29 and F-5 aircraft, the RMAF began its Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) acquisition program in 2011, with a planned entry of service date between 2015 and 2016. While it was initially reported that the RMAF was seeking to procure 18 aircraft, this number rose to 24 to 40 new aircraft in 2014 with a budget reported between $1.8 and $2.4 billion dollars. According to then minister of defence Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, only Western manufactured aircraft were being considered. Four companies were shortlisted; Boeing, BAE Systems, Dassault Group, Saab AB, each offering their respective F/A-18 Super Hornet, Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, JAS 39 Gripen aircraft.

The program was put on hold indefinitely in 2014 as a result of budget restrictions and the forthcoming Eleventh Malaysia Plan, which covers government spending from 2016 to 2020. In response, Dassault offered a financial package consisting of a loan with a ten-year repayment plan guaranteed by the French government. This was countered by Saab, which offered a leasing deal, as did BAE Systems, which also offered to set up a local facility for maintenance and repair with possible financing by the British government. The Russian defence export corporation, Rosoboronexport, which previously supplied the Royal Malaysian Air Force with the Sukhoi Su-30MKM expressed its readiness to discuss the prospect of establishing joint licensed production facilities in Malaysia in 2016.

By 2016, the choice was narrowed down to either Dassault Rafale or Eurofighter Typhoon, with the former reportedly favoured by officials within the defence ministry. However, as a result of economic uncertainty as well as the rise of Islamist militancy in the region (see the Siege of Marawi in the neighbouring Philippines), immediate priority shifted from procuring new combat aircraft to increasing surveillance capability and the MRCA program was put on hold again with the a final decision only expected as late as 2020.

With economic difficulties hindering the completion of MRCA program, then deputy defence minister Ikmal Hisham announced that the government would seek to purchase the Kuwaiti Air Force&#x27;s F/A-18C/D Hornet fleet, which it was phasing out in favour of newer aircraft in 2021. 30 planned to be acquried from KAF. Waiting for US government approval since it is US origin military equipment.

===Light combat aircraft===
In 2018, the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) program began with the aim of replacing the RMAF&#x27;s Aermacchi MB-339 and BAE Systems Hawk fleet with 36 new aircraft as fighter-lead in trainers as well as light combat aircraft. Eight designs were submitted during the initial phase of the program, with the major contenders being the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master, HAL Tejas and KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, while the Aero L-39NG, Boeing T-7 Red Hawk, Hongdu L-15 Falcon, Yakovlev Yak-130 and CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder were considered unlikely to be selected owing to their relatively new designs as well as the possibility of United States Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions. The Saab Gripen was later added onto the RMAF&#x27;s list of aircraft being considered, replacing the Boeing T-7 Red Hawk.

The program in its initial form was approved in 2019 with funding slated for 2021. It was renamed the Fighter-Lead In Trainer/Light Combat Aircraft (FLIT-LCA) program in the government&#x27;s defence white paper in 2020 and launched as an open tender, a first for military aircraft procurement. Six designs were submitted, Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master, HAL Tejas, KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, Hondu L-15 Falcon, Mikoyan MiG-35 and TAI Hürjet. The tender was eventually won by the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle in 2022 but challenged and reported to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, as the decision to award the tender was made by a caretaker government. The subsequent Malaysian government eventually placed an order for 18 &#x27;Block 20&#x27; variants, which feature an AESA radar, a Link 16 tactical data link, the capability for inflight refueling and a Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod in 2023 with a deal worth $920 million dollars and the deliveries set to begin by October 2026 and lasting until June 2027. It is likely that another 18 KAI T-50 Golden Eagles will be ordered in 2027, which would bring the total up to 36 aircraft.

In March 2024, it was reported that six Royal Malaysian Air Force pilots would begin training in early 2026 on the FA-50 at a Republic of Korea Air Force airbase in Gwangju.

===Maritime patrol aircraft===
The RMAF expressed a need for increasing its maritime patrol capability with new aircraft as early as 2011, but budgetary constraints meant approval for new acquisitions wasn&#x27;t given until 2017. Four designs were shortlisted to replace the RMAF&#x27;s aging fleet of Beechcraft Super King Air, namely the Airbus C-295, Boeing P-8 Poseidon, ATR 72 and CASA/IPTN CN-235, which can be acquired from CASA (an Airbus subsidiary) or Indonesian Aerospace, with procurement to begin in 2021. It was reported as late as 2019 that the Japanese government had offered its surplus P-3C Orion aircraft but that it was unlikely the Malaysian government would accept.

In 2018, the Malaysian government signed a contract with Indonesian Aerospace to convert three of the RMAF&#x27;s existing CN-235 transport planes into maritime patrol aircraft. In 2020, funding was secured from the United States&#x27; Maritime Security Initiative (MSI) and conversions began the same year, and all three aircraft were formally handed over in 2024.

In 2022, it was reported that the Malaysian government had finalised a tender and a contract worth $172 million for two ATR 72-600 maritime patrol variants was awarded to Leonardo, one of ATR&#x27;s parent companies in 2023. The deal, described by the Malaysian defence minister as the first phase will see deliveries begin in 2026.

===Airborne early warning and control aircraft===
In 2018, the RMAF announced its Capability Plan 2025 (CAP55), which details its plans up to 2025. It intends to operate a squadron of airborne early warning and control aircraft, which it currently does not possess. Saab had previously offered two Saab 340 AEW&amp;C aircraft in a package deal with its Gripen fighters as part of the MRCA program in 2014. Saab has also previously signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) concerning airborne early warning and control systems with Malaysian company DRB-HICOM, which owns DefTech, a local defence contractor.

===Medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle===
As a part of the modernization program, Malaysia also intends to acquire six MALE UAV. Malaysian government has issues a MALE UAV tender in 2020 and it is expected the procurement will take place in 2021. The major contenders of this project would be the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, TAI Anka, Bayraktar TB2, Safran Patroller, Thales Watchkeeper WK450, Kronshtadt Orion, CAIG Wing Loong and CASC Rainbow.

As of March 2022, it is reported the program is currently undergoing physical evaluation stage which has been shortlisted by the Procurement Board of the Ministry of Defence, and this process is still ongoing.

In October 2022, Malaysia&#x27;s Defence Minister, Hishammudin Hussein announced that the TAI Anka is selected for the procurement of three MALE-UAS units.

===Utility helicopter===
In 2007, Najib Razak announced that the Sikorsky S-61A4 Nuri helicopter in service since 1968 would be phased out by 2012 and replaced by the Eurocopter EC725. Deputy RMAF Chief Lieutenant General Bashir Abu Bakar told the media after opening Heli-Asia 2007 that tender assessment for the replacement of the Sikorsky S-61A-4 Nuri would occur in early 2008. At the 12th Defence Services Asia (DSA) exhibition 2010, a Letter of Agreement (LoA) was signed for 12 EC725 helicopters to be supplied to the RMAF. With that, EADS, (the European Aeronautical Defence and Space Company), pledged 100 million Euros to set up a comprehensive helicopter centre in Subang for an aeronautical academy, training, simulation and a maintenance, repair and overhaul facility for the Eurocopter EC725 military version and the Eurocopter EC225 civilian model.

Although there was a plan to replace all the Sikorsky S-61A-4 Nuri, due to budget constraints the government only managed to buy 12 Eurocopter EC725. For this reason, Nuri helicopters were still active in service until 2019. In LIMA 2019, Malaysia also expressed interest to buy Mil Mi-171 (modified armed version for Mil Mi-17) from Russia. It was reported on 7 January 2020 that the RMAF grounded its Nuri helicopters and RMAF General Ackbal Abdul Samad remarked that there was an evaluation of a new utility helicopter to replace all the remaining Nuri.

In 2021, four AgustaWestland AW139 were leased from a Malaysian aviation company, Weststar Aviation, as temporary replacement before the eventual procurement of new 24 helicopters to replace the S-61A4 Nuri.

===Ground-based radar===
In 2019, it is confirmed that RMAF sought for three new ground-based radar. The major contenders of this project would be the Thales Ground Master 400, Selex RAT-31, Giraffe radar and Lockheed Martin TPS-77 MMR.

In 2021, it is reported the US Department of Defense has &#x27;gifted&#x27; an export version of Lockheed Martin TPS-77 MMR to Malaysia in order to provide secure interoperable C3I (Command Control Communications and Intelligence) and sensor systems supporting U.S. Joint Air Operations to US Government FMS (Foreign Military Sales) customers. Through LIMA 2023, Malaysia has awarded Thales for the procurement of one unit Ground Master 400 radar for the RMAF.

===Medium-range air defence===
In 2021, it was confirmed that RMAF sought for a regiment of medium-range air defence system to improve the national air defence capabilities. The contenders for the program are still unknown.

In 2014, a Malaysian private company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a Chinese defence firm to acquire Chinese LY-80 medium range air defence missile, but the government of Malaysia did not endorse it.

==Incidents and accidents==
* Since 1989, around 95 armed forces personnel (most of those are the RMAF) have been killed in 18 crashes involving the ageing type American-made Sikorsky S-61A4 Nuri helicopter. This led the RMAF to purchase the French-made EC725 helicopter to replace it. But with the nation having ordered only 12 of a planned 28 EC725 helicopters as replacements, the RMAF was forced to prolong the life of its Sikorskys. On October 21, 2016, it was reported that a Canadian helicopter company Heli-One will upgrade all Malaysia&#x27;s &quot;Nuri&quot; helicopter.
* On 2 September 1998, a Mikoyan MiG-29 suffered a hydraulic failure during a flight and a battery failure when it was returning to base.

* In May 2008, two J85-GE-21 engines that power the Northrop F-5E Tiger II fighter jets belonging to the Royal Malaysian Air Force were reported missing, as of sometime in 2007, from an RMAF warehouse in Kuala Lumpur during Najib&#x27;s tenure as Defence Minister in Abdullah Ahmad Badawi&#x27;s cabinet. The jet engines belonged to the 12th Squadron (Scorpion) based in Butterworth. The issue became a matter of political dispute and it was reported a brigadier-general together with 40 other armed forces personnel had been sacked over the incident. Further investigation led to the arrest of two RMAF personnel and a civilian contractor were charged in connection with the theft and disposal of both engines on 6 January 2010. On February 5, 2010, Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail revealed that the two missing engines had been found in Uruguay with the help of the Government of Uruguay and the Malaysian government is proceeding with the necessary measures to secure their return. Investigations showed that the engines were taken out of the RMAF base between 20 December 2007 to 1 January 2008 before being sent to a warehouse in Subang Jaya to be shipped out of Malaysia to South America.

A fisherman who were trying to help the crews out of the aircraft were reported drowned after his foot got stuck in the mud. The black box from the aircraft was eventually found on the next day and was sent to Bandung, Indonesia for it to be analyzed by the Indonesian manufacturer over the cause of the accident.

<text>In linear algebra, a generalized eigenvector of an formula_1 matrix formula_2 is a vector which satisfies certain criteria which are more relaxed than those for an (ordinary) eigenvector.

Let formula_3 be an formula_4-dimensional vector space and let formula_2 be the matrix representation of a linear map from formula_3 to formula_3 with respect to some ordered basis.

There may not always exist a full set of formula_4 linearly independent eigenvectors of formula_2 that form a complete basis for formula_3. That is, the matrix formula_2 may not be diagonalizable. This happens when the algebraic multiplicity of at least one eigenvalue formula_12 is greater than its geometric multiplicity (the nullity of the matrix formula_13, or the dimension of its nullspace). In this case, formula_12 is called a defective eigenvalue and formula_2 is called a defective matrix.

A generalized eigenvector formula_16 corresponding to formula_12, together with the matrix formula_13 generate a Jordan chain of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors which form a basis for an invariant subspace of formula_3.

Using generalized eigenvectors, a set of linearly independent eigenvectors of formula_2 can be extended, if necessary, to a complete basis for formula_3. This basis can be used to determine an &quot;almost diagonal matrix&quot; formula_22 in Jordan normal form, similar to formula_2, which is useful in computing certain matrix functions of formula_2. The matrix formula_22 is also useful in solving the system of linear differential equations formula_26 where formula_2 need not be diagonalizable.

The dimension of the generalized eigenspace corresponding to a given eigenvalue formula_28 is the algebraic multiplicity of formula_28.

== Overview and definition ==
There are several equivalent ways to define an ordinary eigenvector. For our purposes, an eigenvector formula_30 associated with an eigenvalue formula_28 of an formula_4 × formula_4 matrix formula_2 is a nonzero vector for which formula_35, where formula_36 is the formula_4 × formula_4 identity matrix and formula_39 is the zero vector of length formula_4. That is, formula_30 is in the kernel of the transformation formula_42. If formula_2 has formula_4 linearly independent eigenvectors, then formula_2 is similar to a diagonal matrix formula_46. That is, there exists an invertible matrix formula_47 such that formula_2 is diagonalizable through the similarity transformation formula_49. The matrix formula_46 is called a spectral matrix for formula_2. The matrix formula_47 is called a modal matrix for formula_2. Diagonalizable matrices are of particular interest since matrix functions of them can be computed easily.

On the other hand, if formula_2 does not have formula_4 linearly independent eigenvectors associated with it, then formula_2 is not diagonalizable.

Definition: A vector formula_57 is a generalized eigenvector of rank &quot;m&quot; of the matrix formula_2 and corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_28 if

:formula_60

but

:formula_61 

Clearly, a generalized eigenvector of rank 1 is an ordinary eigenvector. Every formula_4 × formula_4 matrix formula_2 has formula_4 linearly independent generalized eigenvectors associated with it and can be shown to be similar to an &quot;almost diagonal&quot; matrix formula_22 in Jordan normal form. That is, there exists an invertible matrix formula_47 such that formula_68. The matrix formula_47 in this case is called a generalized modal matrix for formula_2. If formula_28 is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity formula_72, then formula_2 will have formula_72 linearly independent generalized eigenvectors corresponding to formula_28. These results, in turn, provide a straightforward method for computing certain matrix functions of formula_2.

Note: For an formula_77 matrix formula_2 over a field formula_79 to be expressed in Jordan normal form, all eigenvalues of formula_2 must be in formula_79. That is, the characteristic polynomial formula_82 must factor completely into linear factors; formula_79 must be an algebraically closed field. For example, if formula_2 has real-valued elements, then it may be necessary for the eigenvalues and the components of the eigenvectors to have complex values.

The set spanned by all generalized eigenvectors for a given formula_85 forms the generalized eigenspace for formula_85.

==Examples==
Here are some examples to illustrate the concept of generalized eigenvectors. Some of the details will be described later.

===Example 1===
This example is simple but clearly illustrates the point. This type of matrix is used frequently in textbooks.
Suppose
:formula_87
Then there is only one eigenvalue, formula_88, and its algebraic multiplicity is formula_89.

Notice that this matrix is in Jordan normal form but is not diagonal. Hence, this matrix is not diagonalizable. Since there is one superdiagonal entry, there will be one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1 (or one could note that the vector space formula_90 is of dimension 2, so there can be at most one generalized eigenvector of rank greater than 1). Alternatively, one could compute the dimension of the nullspace of formula_91 to be formula_92, and thus there are formula_93 generalized eigenvectors of rank greater than 1.

The ordinary eigenvector formula_94 is computed as usual (see the eigenvector page for examples). Using this eigenvector, we compute the generalized eigenvector formula_95 by solving

:formula_96
Writing out the values:
:formula_97
This simplifies to

:formula_98

The element formula_99 has no restrictions. The generalized eigenvector of rank 2 is then formula_100, where &quot;a&quot; can have any scalar value. The choice of &quot;a&quot; = 0 is usually the simplest.

Note that

:formula_101

so that formula_95 is a generalized eigenvector, because

:formula_103

so that formula_104 is an ordinary eigenvector, and that formula_105 and formula_106 are linearly independent and hence constitute a basis for the vector space formula_90.

===Example 2===
This example is more complex than Example 1. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to construct an interesting example of low order.
The matrix

:formula_108

has &quot;eigenvalues&quot; formula_109 and formula_110 with &quot;algebraic multiplicities&quot; formula_111 and formula_112, but &quot;geometric multiplicities&quot; formula_113 and formula_114.

The &quot;generalized eigenspaces&quot; of formula_2 are calculated below.
formula_116 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with formula_117.
formula_118 is a generalized eigenvector associated with formula_117.
formula_120 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with formula_121.
formula_122 and formula_123 are generalized eigenvectors associated with formula_121.

:formula_125

:formula_126

:formula_127

:formula_128

:formula_129

This results in a basis for each of the &quot;generalized eigenspaces&quot; of formula_2.
Together the two &quot;chains&quot; of generalized eigenvectors span the space of all 5-dimensional column vectors.

:formula_131

An &quot;almost diagonal&quot; matrix formula_22 in &quot;Jordan normal form&quot;, similar to formula_2 is obtained as follows:

:formula_134
:formula_135

where formula_47 is a generalized modal matrix for formula_2, the columns of formula_47 are a canonical basis for formula_2, and formula_140.

== Jordan chains ==
Definition: Let formula_57 be a generalized eigenvector of rank &quot;m&quot; corresponding to the matrix formula_2 and the eigenvalue formula_28. The chain generated by formula_57 is a set of vectors formula_145 given by

where formula_146 is always an ordinary eigenvector with a given eigenvalue formula_28. Thus, in general,

The vector formula_148, given by (), is a generalized eigenvector of rank &quot;j&quot; corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_28. A chain is a linearly independent set of vectors.

== Canonical basis ==

Definition: A set of &quot;n&quot; linearly independent generalized eigenvectors is a canonical basis if it is composed entirely of Jordan chains.

Thus, once we have determined that a generalized eigenvector of rank &quot;m&quot; is in a canonical basis, it follows that the &quot;m&quot; − 1 vectors formula_150 that are in the Jordan chain generated by formula_151 are also in the canonical basis.

Let formula_152 be an eigenvalue of formula_2 of algebraic multiplicity formula_154. First, find the ranks (matrix ranks) of the matrices formula_155. The integer formula_156 is determined to be the &quot;first integer&quot; for which formula_157 has rank formula_158 (&quot;n&quot; being the number of rows or columns of formula_2, that is, formula_2 is &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot;).

Now define

:formula_161

The variable formula_162 designates the number of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank &quot;k&quot; corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_152 that will appear in a canonical basis for formula_2. Note that

:formula_165.

== Computation of generalized eigenvectors ==
In the preceding sections we have seen techniques for obtaining the formula_4 linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of a canonical basis for the vector space formula_3 associated with an formula_77 matrix formula_2. These techniques can be combined into a procedure:

:Solve the characteristic equation of formula_2 for eigenvalues formula_152 and their algebraic multiplicities formula_154;
:For each formula_173
::Determine formula_174;
::Determine formula_156;
::Determine formula_176 for formula_177;
::Determine each Jordan chain for formula_12;

=== Example 3 ===
The matrix

:formula_179

has an eigenvalue formula_180 of algebraic multiplicity formula_181 and an eigenvalue formula_182 of algebraic multiplicity formula_183. We also have formula_184. For formula_185 we have formula_186.

:formula_187
:formula_188
:formula_189

The first integer formula_190 for which formula_191 has rank formula_192 is formula_193.

We now define

:formula_194
:formula_195
:formula_196

Consequently, there will be three linearly independent generalized eigenvectors; one each of ranks 3, 2 and 1. Since formula_185 corresponds to a single chain of three linearly independent generalized eigenvectors, we know that there is a generalized eigenvector formula_198 of rank 3 corresponding to formula_185 such that

but

Equations () and () represent linear systems that can be solved for formula_198. Let

:formula_201

Then

:formula_202

and

:formula_203

Thus, in order to satisfy the conditions () and (), we must have formula_204 and formula_205. No restrictions are placed on formula_206 and formula_207. By choosing formula_208, we obtain

:formula_209

as a generalized eigenvector of rank 3 corresponding to formula_210. Note that it is possible to obtain infinitely many other generalized eigenvectors of rank 3 by choosing different values of formula_206, formula_207 and formula_213, with formula_205. Our first choice, however, is the simplest.

Now using equations (), we obtain formula_118 and formula_116 as generalized eigenvectors of rank 2 and 1, respectively, where

:formula_217

and

:formula_218

The simple eigenvalue formula_182 can be dealt with using standard techniques and has an ordinary eigenvector

:formula_220

A canonical basis for formula_2 is

:formula_222

formula_223 and formula_198 are generalized eigenvectors associated with formula_117, while formula_120 is the ordinary eigenvector associated with formula_121.

This is a fairly simple example. In general, the numbers formula_176 of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank formula_229 will not always be equal. That is, there may be several chains of different lengths corresponding to a particular eigenvalue.

== Generalized modal matrix ==

Let formula_2 be an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix. A generalized modal matrix formula_47 for formula_2 is an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix whose columns, considered as vectors, form a canonical basis for formula_2 and appear in formula_47 according to the following rules:

* All Jordan chains consisting of one vector (that is, one vector in length) appear in the first columns of formula_47.
* All vectors of one chain appear together in adjacent columns of formula_47.
* Each chain appears in formula_47 in order of increasing rank (that is, the generalized eigenvector of rank 1 appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 2 of the same chain, which appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 3 of the same chain, etc.).

== Jordan normal form ==
Let formula_3 be an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space; let formula_239 be a linear map in , the set of all linear maps from formula_3 into itself; and let formula_2 be the matrix representation of formula_239 with respect to some ordered basis. It can be shown that if the characteristic polynomial formula_243 of formula_2 factors into linear factors, so that formula_243 has the form

:formula_246

where formula_247 are the distinct eigenvalues of formula_2, then each formula_249 is the algebraic multiplicity of its corresponding eigenvalue formula_12 and formula_2 is similar to a matrix formula_22 in Jordan normal form, where each formula_12 appears formula_249 consecutive times on the diagonal, and the entry directly above each formula_12 (that is, on the superdiagonal) is either 0 or 1: in each block the entry above the first occurrence of each formula_12 is always 0 (except in the first block); all other entries on the superdiagonal are 1. All other entries (that is, off the diagonal and superdiagonal) are 0. (But no ordering is imposed among the eigenvalues, or among the blocks for a given eigenvalue.) The matrix formula_22 is as close as one can come to a diagonalization of formula_2. If formula_2 is diagonalizable, then all entries above the diagonal are zero. Note that some textbooks have the ones on the subdiagonal, that is, immediately below the main diagonal instead of on the superdiagonal. The eigenvalues are still on the main diagonal.

Every &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix formula_2 is similar to a matrix formula_22 in Jordan normal form, obtained through the similarity transformation formula_262, where formula_47 is a generalized modal matrix for formula_2. (See Note above.)

=== Example 4 ===
Find a matrix in Jordan normal form that is similar to

:formula_265

Solution: The characteristic equation of formula_2 is formula_267, hence, formula_268 is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity three. Following the procedures of the previous sections, we find that

:formula_269

and

:formula_270

Thus, formula_271 and formula_272, which implies that a canonical basis for formula_2 will contain one linearly independent generalized eigenvector of rank 2 and two linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of rank 1, or equivalently, one chain of two vectors formula_274 and one chain of one vector formula_275. Designating formula_276, we find that

:formula_277

and

:formula_278

where formula_47 is a generalized modal matrix for formula_2, the columns of formula_47 are a canonical basis for formula_2, and formula_140. Note that since generalized eigenvectors themselves are not unique, and since some of the columns of both formula_47 and formula_22 may be interchanged, it follows that both formula_47 and formula_22 are not unique.

=== Example 5 ===
In Example 3, we found a canonical basis of linearly independent generalized eigenvectors for a matrix formula_2. A generalized modal matrix for formula_2 is

:formula_290

A matrix in Jordan normal form, similar to formula_2 is

:formula_292

so that formula_140.

== Applications ==

=== Matrix functions ===

Three of the most fundamental operations which can be performed on square matrices are matrix addition, multiplication by a scalar, and matrix multiplication. These are exactly those operations necessary for defining a polynomial function of an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrix formula_2. If we recall from basic calculus that many functions can be written as a Maclaurin series, then we can define more general functions of matrices quite easily. If formula_2 is diagonalizable, that is

:formula_296

with

:formula_297

then

:formula_298

and the evaluation of the Maclaurin series for functions of formula_2 is greatly simplified. For example, to obtain any power &quot;k&quot; of formula_2, we need only compute formula_301, premultiply formula_301 by formula_47, and postmultiply the result by formula_304.

Using generalized eigenvectors, we can obtain the Jordan normal form for formula_2 and these results can be generalized to a straightforward method for computing functions of nondiagonalizable matrices. (See Matrix function#Jordan decomposition.)

=== Differential equations ===

Consider the problem of solving the system of linear ordinary differential equations

where

:formula_306 and formula_307

If the matrix formula_2 is a diagonal matrix so that formula_309 for formula_310, then the system () reduces to a system of &quot;n&quot; equations which take the form

In this case, the general solution is given by

:formula_311
:formula_312
::formula_313
:formula_314

In the general case, we try to diagonalize formula_2 and reduce the system () to a system like () as follows. If formula_2 is diagonalizable, we have formula_317, where formula_47 is a modal matrix for formula_2. Substituting formula_320, equation () takes the form formula_321, or

where

The solution of () is

:formula_322
:formula_323
::formula_313
:formula_325

The solution formula_326 of () is then obtained using the relation ().

On the other hand, if formula_2 is not diagonalizable, we choose formula_47 to be a generalized modal matrix for formula_2, such that formula_262 is the Jordan normal form of formula_2. The system formula_332 has the form

where the formula_152 are the eigenvalues from the main diagonal of formula_22 and the formula_335 are the ones and zeros from the superdiagonal of formula_22. The system () is often more easily solved than (). We may solve the last equation in () for formula_337, obtaining formula_338. We then substitute this solution for formula_337 into the next to last equation in () and solve for formula_340. Continuing this procedure, we work through () from the last equation to the first, solving the entire system for formula_341. The solution formula_326 is then obtained using the relation ().

Lemma:

Given the following chain of generalized eigenvectors of length formula_343
:formula_344
:formula_345
:formula_346
:formula_313
:formula_348,
these functions solve the system of equations,
:formula_349
Proof:

Define
:formula_350
:formula_351
Then, as formula_352 and formula_353,
:formula_354.
On the other hand we have, formula_350 and so
:formula_356
:formula_357
:formula_358
:formula_359
:formula_360
as required.

<doc id="1137633" wikidata="Q847773" url="?curid=1137633" title="Chinese compound surname">
<text>A Chinese compound surname is a Chinese surname using more than one character. Many of these compound surnames derive from Zhou dynasty Chinese noble and official titles, professions, place names and other areas, to serve a purpose. Some are originally from various tribes that lived in ancient China, while others were created by joining two one-character family names. Only a few of these names (e.g. Ouyang [歐陽/欧阳], Shangguan [上官], Sima [司馬/司马], Zhuge [諸葛/诸葛], Situ [司徒], Xiahou [夏侯], Huangfu [皇甫], and Huyan [呼延]) can still be found quite commonly in modern times with Ouyang, Shangguan, Sima and Situ appearing most frequently. Many clans eventually took on a single-character surname for various reasons. Lists below are arranged alphabetically by their Mandarin pinyin spellings.

==Native Han compound surnames==
==Double-barrelled surnames==
Double-barrelled surname () occurs sometimes when both families of a marriage wish to pass down their surnames, or when a child wishes to commemorate both the biological and foster parents. This is often distinguished from compound surnames (), which cannot be split into two single-character surnames. A doubled-barrelled surname is also distinguished from a married name (), as married names are not passed down to the next generations. 
==Non-Han surnames==
Peoples other than Han have resided in China and have their names transliterated into Chinese. A large number of these non-Han surnames contain more than one Chinese character.

<doc id="1137642" wikidata="Q7128908" url="?curid=1137642" title="Pam Barrett">
<text>Pamela T. Barrett (November 26, 1953 – January 21, 2008) was a Canadian politician who sat in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta as a member of the New Democratic Party.

==Early political career==
Barrett started working for the Alberta New Democratic Party as a researcher in the legislature office of Grant Notley. She also worked for the Alberta Federation of Labour.

Barrett ran in the 1986 Alberta general election and was elected in the riding of Edmonton-Highlands. She defeated incumbent David Thomas King, the Minister of Technology, Research, and Telecommunications, in what many regarded as a substantial upset. She, Marie Laing and a few others were identified in local newspapers as &quot;giant-slayers&quot; for un-seating Conservative cabinet minister/MLAs.

She was named to a prominent position in the NDP Official Opposition, which for the first time in that party&#x27;s history was 16 MLAs strong. She served as the New Democrats&#x27; Deputy House Leader from 1986 to 1993, backing up caucus leader Ray Martin.

She retired from the legislature in 1993 owing to poor health resulting from job stress.

==Leader of Alberta New Democrats==
Barrett came back to politics when she contested and won the Alberta NDP leadership in 1996 following the resignation of Ross Harvey. In the 1997 Alberta general election she ran and won in the re-drawn district of Edmonton-Highlands.

Under Barrett in the 1997 election, the New Democrats won two seats after having been shut out in the 1993 election. Her aggressive leadership style inspired observers to nickname her &quot;Mighty Mouse.&quot;

==Near death experience==
Barrett resigned the NDP leadership and her seat in 2000 after having what she claimed to be a near-death experience in a dentist&#x27;s chair. After her retirement from politics she went on a &quot;spiritual search&quot;. Her near death-experience was a subject of both serious and satiric attention in the Canadian media. She was parodied on the CBC Television show &quot;The Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; and featured on the front cover of the May 2000 issue of lifestyle magazine &quot;Elm Street&quot;.

==Death==
Barrett died on January 21, 2008, aged 54, at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, from oesophageal cancer, after battling the disease for at least two years.

<doc id="1137646" wikidata="Q20946" url="?curid=1137646" title="Acineta">
<text>Acineta, abbreviated as Acn in horticultural trade, is a small genus belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). The name is derived from the Greek word &#x27;akinetos&#x27; (immobile), referring to the rigid labellum (lip).

These epiphytic orchids occur in tropical mountainous forests from Mexico to western South America, at altitudes up to 2,000 m. They are sometimes lithophytic when found on steep embankments.

The large, leaves are parallel-nerved and resemble those of &quot;Peristeria&quot; and &quot;Lycaste&quot;, while the structure of the flowers bears a closer resemblance to &quot;Stanhopea&quot;.

The species produce a inflorescence, bearing racemes of many fragrant cup-shaped, pale yellow to reddish brown flowers. The sidelobes of the labellum (lip) come together in a central callus. The basal part of the lip () is at least as long as the sidelobes. The column is .
The column of these orchids bears two pollinia, except in &quot;Acineta dalessandroi&quot;, which has four (making its classification in this genus doubtful). These orchids are insect pollinated by male bees in the genus &quot;Eulaema&quot; or &quot;Eufriesia&quot;.

Some regard these as being among of the most splendid looking of all orchids.

For relatives of Acineta see Stanhopeinae.

<text>Clean Up Australia Limited is a not-for-profit Australian environmental conservation organisation. It is registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.

Clean Up Australia Limited has sponsored a yearly Clean Up Australia Day since 1990. On the first Sunday of March each year, groups of citizens clean up rubbish at different sites across the country. According to the organisation, more than a million people participate each year. Clean Up Australia Limited also supports other environmental efforts, including preventing waste in the environment.

==History==
Clean Up Australia Day was first held in January 1990. The idea developed from an Australian Bicentenary event, &quot;Clean-Up Lake Macquarie&quot;, which was instigated in 1987 by Ivan Welsh as Mayor of Lake Macquarie. Then followed the local &quot;Clean Up Sydney Harbour&quot; event in 1989, organised by Ian Kiernan and Kim McKay, with more than 40,000 volunteers who collected approximately 5,000 tonnes of rubbish. The 1990 &quot;Clean Up Australia Day&quot; event was launched by the then prime minister, Bob Hawke, over the initial opposition of the then state premier, Nick Greiner. Greiner later reversed his position and offered his support for the event.

&quot;The Rubbish Report&quot; was produced each year from data collected by surveying participants. As of 1990, 94% of rubbish was from packaging. By 1993, the campaign was focusing more strongly on sorting the rubbish collected into recyclables, and Kiernan was using Clean Up Australia Day to advocate for changes to legislation surrounding reduction of packaging and returning packaging to companies. In 1994, over 8,000 sites were cleaned up as part of the day. In 2008, Kiernan put a focus on bottled water, advocating for the expansion of container deposit refunds in Australia. 

In 2012, sponsorship cutbacks and a drop in private donations caused the organisation to have to dismiss all of its paid staff.

==Clean Up the World==
Clean Up the World was established in 1994 after Ian Kiernan and Kim McKay approached the United Nations Environment Programme, with an idea to take his Clean Up concept global.

Clean Up the World is an international campaign that encourages communities to clean up, fix up and conserve their environment through the Clean Up the World Membership program.

A Clean Up the World weekend is held on the third weekend of September each year and, by 2007, the event attracted more than 35 million people from over 120 countries to volunteer.

==Other campaigns and projects==

===Business Clean Up Day===
Business Clean Up Day provides Australian businesses with an opportunity to contribute to waste reduction and the improvement of the environment.

Businesses register their commitment to implement at least one environment-friendly initiative in their workplace, giving them an opportunity to work as a team and make a difference to their local environment.

===Schools Clean Up Day===
Schools Clean Up Day is designed to allow students to participate in Clean Up Australia as part of a school activity.

===Clean Up the Kimberley===
Clean Up the Kimberley is a series of community action-based projects focussed on the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The primary objectives of this initiative are to clean up rubbish hot spots, increase awareness of the scale and impact of rubbish in the region, change tourist and local community behaviour and improve local recycling and waste management infrastructure.

===Clean Up the Alps===
Clean Up the Alps is a project aimed at protecting the Alpine region of Victoria. It is run in conjunction with Parks Victoria, Conservation Volunteers Australia, and local communities as part of the Victorian Government&#x27;s &#x27;The Alps: A fresh start – a healthy future&#x27; program. The project culminates in the Clean Up the Alps weekend, held annually in November.

<text>Friedrich Kluge (21 June 1856 – 21 May 1926) was a German philologist and educator. He is known for the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the German Language&quot; (), which was first published in 1883.

== Biography ==
Kluge was born in Cologne. He studied comparative linguistics and classical and modern philologies at the universities of Leipzig, Strasbourg and Freiburg. As a student, his instructors were August Leskien, Georg Curtius, Friedrich Zarncke and Rudolf Hildebrand at Leipzig and Heinrich Hübschmann, Bernhard ten Brink and Erich Schmidt at the University of Strasbourg.

He became a teacher of English and German philology at Strassburg (1880), an assistant professor of German at the University of Jena in 1884, a full professor in 1886, and in 1893 was appointed professor of German language and literature at Freiburg as a successor to Hermann Paul.

A Proto-Germanic sound law that he formulated in a paper in 1884 is now known as Kluge&#x27;s law.

He died in Freiburg, Germany.

<doc id="1137662" wikidata="Q1103697" url="?curid=1137662" title="Clyde puffer">
<text>The Clyde puffer is a type of small coal-fired and single-masted cargo ship, built mainly on the Forth and Clyde Canal, which provided a vital supply link around the west coast and Hebrides of Scotland.

Built between 1856 and 1939, these stumpy little steamboats achieved an almost mythical status thanks largely to the short stories Neil Munro wrote about the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; and her captain Para Handy, which produced three television series.

==Characteristics==

Clyde puffers characteristically had bluff bows, crew&#x27;s quarters with table and cooking stove in the focsle, and a single mast with derrick in front of the large hold. The funnel and ship&#x27;s wheel stood aft above the engine room, followed by a small captain&#x27;s cabin in the stern. When publication of the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; stories began in 1905 the ship&#x27;s wheel was still in the open, but later a wheelhouse was added aft of the funnel giving the puffers their distinctive image. Their flat bottom allowed them to beach and unload at low tide, essential to supply remote settlements without suitable piers. Typical cargoes could include coal and furniture, with farm produce and gravel sometimes being brought back.

==History==
The puffers developed from the gabbart, small single masted sailing barges, which took most of the coasting trade. The original puffer was the &quot;Thomas&quot;, an iron canal boat of 1856, less than 66 ft (20 m) long to fit in the Forth and Clyde Canal locks, powered by a simple steam engine without a condenser, since as it drew fresh water from the canal there was no need to economise on water use. Once steam had been used by the engine, it was simply exhausted up the funnel in a series of puffs as the piston stroked. As well as the visual sight of a series of steam puffs following the boat, the simple engines made a characteristic puffing sound. By the 1870s similar boats were being adapted for use beyond the canal and fitted with condensers so that they no longer puffed, but the name stuck. Some non-condensing puffers (included those with compound engines) were built until the 1920s when purely canal traffic decreased and the vast majority of coasters had to operate in sea water. A derrick was added to the single mast to lift cargo.

From this basic type of puffer three varieties developed: &quot;inside&quot; boats continued in use on the Forth and Clyde canal, while &quot;shorehead&quot; boats extended their range eastwards into the Firth of Forth and westwards as far as the Isle of Bute and from there up the length of Loch Fyne, their length kept at 66 ft (20 m) to use the canal locks. Both these types had a crew of three. Puffers of a third type, the &quot;outside&quot; boats, were built for the rougher sea routes to the Hebrides islands with a crew of four and the length increased to 88 ft (27 m) still allowing use of the larger locks on the Crinan Canal, which cuts across the Kintyre peninsula. There were more than 20 builders in Scotland, mainly on the Forth and Clyde canal at Kirkintilloch and Maryhill, Glasgow.

During World War I these handy little ships showed their worth in servicing warships, and were used at Scapa Flow, and for World War II the Admiralty placed an order in 1939 for steamships on the same design, mostly built in England, with the class name of VIC, standing for &quot;Victualling Inshore Craft&quot;. After the war a number of VICs came into the coasting trade.

The &quot;Innisgara&quot; was fitted with an internal combustion engine in 1912, and while puffers generally were steam-powered, after World War II new ships began to be diesel engined, and a number of VICs were converted to diesel. The coasting trade serving the islands was kept up by the Glenlight Shipping Company of Greenock until in 1993 the government withdrew subsidies and, unable to compete with road transport using subsidised ferries, the service ended.

==In fiction==
The short stories that Neil Munro first published in the Glasgow &quot;Evening News&quot; in 1905 appeared in the newspaper for over twenty years and achieved widespread fame, with collections issued in book form since 1931 still in print today. With the continuing popularity of these tales, the puffers became film stars in The Maggie, and Para Handy with his &quot;Vital Spark&quot; was the subject of three popular BBC television series dating from 1959 to 1995.&#x27;

==Surviving craft==

A small number of puffers survive as conservation projects, though most have diesel engines.

&quot;VIC 32&quot; 
is one of the last few surviving coal-fired steam-powered puffers and is based at The Change House, Crinan. She was built by Dunston&#x27;s of Thorne, Yorkshire in November 1943 – a busy time for the Clyde Ship building yards. As the wartime Admiralty needed 50, (later 100) victualling boats in a hurry, they were built in groups of three by various yards in England. No new designs were needed as the perfect boat existed in a Clyde Puffer.

Steam sailings on &quot;VIC 32&quot; have been available to the public from 1979, latterly as cruises on the Caledonian Canal. From 2004 she underwent extensive refitting at Corpach Boatyard at the west end of the canal near Fort William, funded by donations and lottery funds. After fitting of a new boiler by Pridham&#x27;s Engineering and Corpach Boatbuilders, she steamed down from Fort William to Crinan, from where cruises on the Caledonian Canal have now re-commenced.

&quot;VIC 56&quot; was built by Pollock, of Faversham in 1945. She is preserved in working order at Chatham Historic Dockyard, regularly steaming in the Thames and Medway estuaries.
&quot;VIC 96&quot; was built by Dunstons of Thorne, South Yorkshire in 1945, and after disposal, was restored at Maryport. The restoration was completed in 2009, retaining its steam engine, boiler and winch.
On 8 August 2009, &quot;VIC 96&quot; arrived at her new home, Chatham No. 1 Basin, after an epic 1,000 miles voyage from Elizabeth Dock, Maryport, which took five weeks.

&quot;VIC 27&quot; was built at Rowhedge Ironworks. She was renamed &quot;Auld Reekie&quot;, and starred as the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; in the third BBC TV Para Handy series where she was berthed at Crinan Basin for 14 years, deteriorating. She was purchased (Oct 2006) by the owner of the Inveraray Maritime Museum who carried out some work on her. She has since been resold to a new owner who has already started on her major restoration work. As she is the oldest surviving steam-powered puffer in existence she must be restored and preserved as part of Scotland&#x27;s heritage afloat.

&quot;VIC 72&quot;, renamed &quot;Eilean Eisdeal&quot;, continued in operation as the last of the true working &quot;puffers&quot; into the mid 1990s. In 2006 she was again renamed as &quot;Vital Spark of Glasgow&quot; after the Inveraray writer Neil Munro&#x27;s &quot;Para Handy&quot; stories. She is now accessible to the public, alongside the &quot;Arctic Penguin&quot; at the Inveraray Maritime Museum, and continues to make sailings.
The &quot;Spartan&quot;, another diesel-engined &quot;puffer&quot;, is on display at the Scottish Maritime Museum at Irvine. &quot;Spartan&quot; has recently undergone restoration work on her hull, and is still being refitted. The museum also features the diesel-powered motor coaster MV &quot;Kyles&quot; at Irvine (an early Clyde built coaster, not a puffer).

The &quot;Pibroch&quot;, built at Bowling, West Dunbartonshire in 1957 as a diesel-engined boat for the Scottish Malt Distillers Ltd, had been lying at Letterfrack, County Galway, Ireland, in desperate need of restoration, since 2002. The Pibroch deteriorated further as time passed, and her bulkheads began to give way. In 2010 she was sold and was subsequently scrapped. A sister-ship, the &quot;Julia T.&quot;, Lies in 30 m of water in Killary Bay some 300 yards off Lettergesh.

There have also been reproduction puffers built to a smaller size, most recently the &quot;MV Mary Hill&quot; for tourist traffic on the Forth and Clyde canal.

<text>James Dixon Robinson III (November 19, 1935 – March 18, 2024) was an American businessman best known for his position as the chief executive officer of American Express Co. from 1977 until his retirement in 1993.

==Early life and education==
James Dixon Robinson III was born to a wealthy family in Atlanta on November 19, 1935. He was educated at the Woodberry Forest School and attended Georgia Tech&#x27;s School of Industrial Management where civil rights icon Blake Van Leer was president. He graduated from Georgia Tech in 1957 where he was a member of the Chi Phi fraternity. After college, Robinson joined the United States Navy. He later earned an MBA from Harvard University in 1961.

==American Express==
James D. Robinson III served as Chairman &amp; CEO of the American Express Company for approximately 16 years. He held additional positions at the company prior to that. While at American Express, Robinson achieved the senior position at the company after his competitor for the position, Robert Morley, launched a thwarted hostile takeover of McGraw-Hill. Robinson went on to purchase Shearson Lehman, IDS, First Data Corporation, Trade Development Bank (Switzerland), and several others. He co-created Warner-Amex with Steve Ross. He played a prominent role in the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout battle as chronicled in the book &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;. Actor Fred Thompson played Robinson in the 1993 movie.

By the end of Robinson&#x27;s tenure, he acknowledged that it had not gone well, saying that his &quot;major miscalculation was ‘a focus on overly rapid growth.&#x27;&quot;

==Other positions==
Robinson became a director of The Coca-Cola Company in 1975. He was a general partner and co-founder of RRE Ventures, a private information technology venture investment firm, along with his son, James D. Robinson IV, a venture capitalist, and a classmate of his son from Harvard Business School, Stuart J. Ellman. Robinson was also a president of J.D. Robinson, Inc., a strategic consulting firm. He was previously a long-time Director and Chairman of Bristol-Myers Squibb, and of Violy, Byorum &amp; Partners, which operated in South America.

Robinson also served on the Boards of Directors of PrimeRevenue and was honorary chairman of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Robinson was a member of the Business Council and the Council on Foreign Relations, and an honorary trustee of the Brookings Institution and World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, of which he was a co-founder. In previous years, he served as co-chairman of the Business Roundtable and chairman of the Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations. He was a member of the global senior advisory board at Jefferies Group.

==Personal life==
In 1957, Robinson married Bettye Bradley; they had two children and divorced in 1983. He married Linda Gosden Robinson in July 1984. They have two children together. 

In 1991, Robinson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Henry Kravis.

On March 18, 2024, Robinson died from respiratory failure, a complication of pneumonia, at a hospital in Roslyn, New York. He was 88.

<doc id="1137672" wikidata="Q1077753" url="?curid=1137672" title="Canonical ensemble">
<text>In statistical mechanics, a canonical ensemble is the statistical ensemble that represents the possible states of a mechanical system in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at a fixed temperature. The system can exchange energy with the heat bath, so that the states of the system will differ in total energy.

The principal thermodynamic variable of the canonical ensemble, determining the probability distribution of states, is the absolute temperature (symbol: ). The ensemble typically also depends on mechanical variables such as the number of particles in the system (symbol: ) and the system&#x27;s volume (symbol: ), each of which influence the nature of the system&#x27;s internal states. An ensemble with these three parameters, which are assumed constant for the ensemble to be considered canonical, is sometimes called the ensemble.

The canonical ensemble assigns a probability to each distinct microstate given by the following exponential:

:formula_1

where is the total energy of the microstate, and is the Boltzmann constant.

The number is the free energy (specifically, the Helmholtz free energy) and is assumed to be a constant for a specific ensemble to be considered canonical. However, the probabilities and will vary if different &quot;N&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;T&quot; are selected. The free energy serves two roles: first, it provides a normalization factor for the probability distribution (the probabilities, over the complete set of microstates, must add up to one); second, many important ensemble averages can be directly calculated from the function .

An alternative but equivalent formulation for the same concept writes the probability as

:formula_2

using the canonical partition function

:formula_3

rather than the free energy. The equations below (in terms of free energy) may be restated in terms of the canonical partition function by simple mathematical manipulations.

Historically, the canonical ensemble was first described by Boltzmann (who called it a &quot;holode&quot;) in 1884 in a relatively unknown paper. It was later reformulated and extensively investigated by Gibbs in 1902.

==Applicability of canonical ensemble==

The canonical ensemble is the ensemble that describes the possible states of a system that is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath (the derivation of this fact can be found in Gibbs).

The canonical ensemble applies to systems of any size; while it is necessary to assume that the heat bath is very large (i.e., take a macroscopic limit), the system itself may be small or large.

The condition that the system is mechanically isolated is necessary in order to ensure it does not exchange energy with any external object besides the heat bath. In general, it is desirable to apply the canonical ensemble to systems that are in direct contact with the heat bath, since it is that contact that ensures the equilibrium. In practical situations, the use of the canonical ensemble is usually justified either 1) by assuming that the contact is mechanically weak, or 2) by incorporating a suitable part of the heat bath connection into the system under analysis, so that the connection&#x27;s mechanical influence on the system is modeled within the system.

When the total energy is fixed but the internal state of the system is otherwise unknown, the appropriate description is not the canonical ensemble but the microcanonical ensemble. For systems where the particle number is variable (due to contact with a particle reservoir), the correct description is the grand canonical ensemble. In statistical physics textbooks for interacting particle systems the three ensembles are assumed to be thermodynamically equivalent: the fluctuations of macroscopic quantities around their average value become small and, as the number of particles tends to infinity, they tend to vanish. In the latter limit, called the thermodynamic limit, the average constraints effectively become hard constraints. The assumption of ensemble equivalence dates back to Gibbs and has been verified for some models of physical systems with short-range interactions and subject to a small number of macroscopic constraints. Despite the fact that many textbooks still convey the message that ensemble equivalence holds for all physical systems, over the last decades various examples of physical systems have been found for which breaking of ensemble equivalence occurs.

==Properties==

== Free energy, ensemble averages, and exact differentials ==

* The partial derivatives of the function give important canonical ensemble average quantities:
** the average pressure is formula_4
** the Gibbs entropy is formula_5
** the partial derivative is approximately related to chemical potential, although the concept of chemical equilibrium does not exactly apply to canonical ensembles of small systems.
** and the average energy is formula_6
* &quot;Exact differential&quot;: From the above expressions, it can be seen that the function , for a given , has the exact differential formula_7
* &quot;First law of thermodynamics&quot;: Substituting the above relationship for into the exact differential of , an equation similar to the first law of thermodynamics is found, except with average signs on some of the quantities: formula_8
* &quot;Energy fluctuations&quot;: The energy in the system has uncertainty in the canonical ensemble. The variance of the energy is formula_9

== Example ensembles ==
&quot;&quot;We may imagine a great number of systems of the same nature, but differing in the configurations and velocities which they have at a given instant, and differing in not merely infinitesimally, but it may be so as to embrace every conceivable combination of configuration and velocities...&quot; J. W. Gibbs&quot; (1903)

=== Boltzmann distribution (separable system) ===

If a system described by a canonical ensemble can be separated into independent parts (this happens if the different parts do not interact), and each of those parts has a fixed material composition, then each part can be seen as a system unto itself and is described by a canonical ensemble having the same temperature as the whole. Moreover, if the system is made up of multiple &quot;similar&quot; parts, then each part has exactly the same distribution as the other parts.

In this way, the canonical ensemble provides exactly the Boltzmann distribution (also known as Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics) for systems of &quot;any number&quot; of particles. In comparison, the justification of the Boltzmann distribution from the microcanonical ensemble only applies for systems with a large number of parts (that is, in the thermodynamic limit).

The Boltzmann distribution itself is one of the most important tools in applying statistical mechanics to real systems, as it massively simplifies the study of systems that can be separated into independent parts (e.g., particles in a gas, electromagnetic modes in a cavity, molecular bonds in a polymer).

=== Ising model (strongly interacting system) ===

In a system composed of pieces that interact with each other, it is usually not possible to find a way to separate the system into independent subsystems as done in the Boltzmann distribution. In these systems it is necessary to resort to using the full expression of the canonical ensemble in order to describe the thermodynamics of the system when it is thermostatted to a heat bath. The canonical ensemble is generally the most straightforward framework for studies of statistical mechanics and even allows one to obtain exact solutions in some interacting model systems.

A classic example of this is the Ising model, which is a widely discussed toy model for the phenomena of ferromagnetism and of self-assembled monolayer formation, and is one of the simplest models that shows a phase transition. Lars Onsager famously calculated exactly the free energy of an infinite-sized square-lattice Ising model at zero magnetic field, in the canonical ensemble.

== Precise expressions for the ensemble ==

The precise mathematical expression for a statistical ensemble depends on the kind of mechanics under consideration—quantum or classical—since the notion of a &quot;microstate&quot; is considerably different in these two cases. In quantum mechanics, the canonical ensemble affords a simple description since diagonalization provides a discrete set of microstates with specific energies. The classical mechanical case is more complex as it involves instead an integral over canonical phase space, and the size of microstates in phase space can be chosen somewhat arbitrarily.

=== Quantum mechanical ===

A statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics is represented by a density matrix, denoted by formula_10. In basis-free notation, the canonical ensemble is the density matrix
: formula_11
where is the system&#x27;s total energy operator (Hamiltonian), and is the matrix exponential operator. The free energy is determined by the probability normalization condition that the density matrix has a trace of one, formula_12:
: formula_13

The canonical ensemble can alternatively be written in a simple form using bra–ket notation, if the system&#x27;s energy eigenstates and energy eigenvalues are known. Given a complete basis of energy eigenstates , indexed by , the canonical ensemble is:
: formula_14
: formula_15
where the are the energy eigenvalues determined by . In other words, a set of microstates in quantum mechanics is given by a complete set of stationary states. The density matrix is diagonal in this basis, with the diagonal entries each directly giving a probability.

=== Classical mechanical ===

In classical mechanics, a statistical ensemble is instead represented by a joint probability density function in the system&#x27;s phase space, 
, where the and are the canonical coordinates (generalized momenta and generalized coordinates) of the system&#x27;s internal degrees of freedom.
In a system of particles, the number of degrees of freedom depends on the number of particles in a way that depends on the physical situation. For a three-dimensional monoatomic gas (not molecules), . In diatomic gases there will also be rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom.

The probability density function for the canonical ensemble is:
: formula_16
where
* is the energy of the system, a function of the phase ,
* is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of , setting the extent of one microstate and providing correct dimensions to .
* is an overcounting correction factor, often used for particle systems where identical particles are able to change place with each other.
* provides a normalizing factor and is also the characteristic state function, the free energy.

Again, the value of is determined by demanding that is a normalized probability density function:
: formula_17
This integral is taken over the entire phase space.

In other words, a microstate in classical mechanics is a phase space region, and this region has volume . This means that each microstate spans a range of energy, however this range can be made arbitrarily narrow by choosing to be very small. The phase space integral can be converted into a summation over microstates, once phase space has been finely divided to a sufficient degree.

<text>Hunaland and its people are mentioned several times in the Poetic Edda, in the Fornaldarsagas, and in chivalric romances.

Its origins are partly the old Frankish kingdom (the Franks were once called &quot;Hugones&quot;, in Latin, and &quot;Hūgas&quot; in Old English) and partly in the Huns.

The Frankish hero Sigurd is called the &quot;Hunnish king&quot; in epic poetry.

Also the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and the &quot;Vilkina saga&quot; mention Hunaland, its kings and its hosts.

In Old Norse sources, Hunaland often has a mythological character and can shift between different parts of Europe, depending on what kind of skills the hero is to show. It is separated from other countries by the forest Myrkviðr, but one source may locate it up in the north at Bjarmaland, another source says that it borders on Reidgotaland, a third source places it in parts of Germany and other sources place it on either side of the Gulf of Bothnia down to Gästrikland, in Sweden.

<text>The 1999 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 53rd season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1999 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1999 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 7 March and ended on 31 October.

Defending champion Mika Häkkinen was again awarded the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. His team McLaren just missed out: it was Ferrari that clinched the World Constructors&#x27; Championship by a margin of four points. It would be the last Drivers&#x27; title for a McLaren driver until . It was Ferrari&#x27;s first Constructors&#x27; title since , but would also mark the first of six successive titles up to .

It was the final season for world champion Damon Hill. It was also the last Drivers&#x27; Championship for McLaren until Lewis Hamilton in 2008.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1999 FIA Formula One World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Bridgestone.
† All engines were 3.0 litre, V10 configuration.

===Team changes===

After three decades in the sport, the Tyrrell team was sold to British American Tobacco and its entry was used by the new British American Racing (BAR) team, with Supertec engines replacing the Ford-Cosworth units of the previous season.

In 1998, Goodyear supplied tires to five teams, but when the company withdrew from the sport after 34 years, it left Bridgestone as the sole tire supplier.

The Mecachrome engines used by Williams in were rebadged as Supertec units.

===Driver changes===
Williams entered the season with an all-new driver pairing: Ralf Schumacher (driving for Jordan in ) and Alessandro Zanardi. The Italian had last driven in F1 for Lotus in . In the years between, he had won the 1997 and 1998 CART championships for Chip Ganassi Racing.

Heinz-Harald Frentzen completed a straight swap with the younger Schumacher, taking the vacant seat at Jordan alongside champion Damon Hill. Frentzen&#x27;s 1998 teammate, the champion Jacques Villeneuve, moved to the newly founded British American Racing (BAR) team. He was partnered with McLaren test driver and FIA GT1 champion Ricardo Zonta, one of three F1 rookies on the grid at the beginning of the season.

1998 Tyrrell driver Ricardo Rosset had retired from racing, while his teammate Toranosuke Takagi moved to Arrows. He was joined by Jordan&#x27;s test driver from last year, Pedro de la Rosa, who also made his debut as a Grand Prix driver. Pedro Diniz left Arrows for Sauber.

Johnny Herbert, whose Sauber seat was taken by Diniz, joined Rubens Barrichello at Stewart. Stewart&#x27;s drivers from 1998 were both absent from the Formula One grid this year: Jan Magnussen moved to the American Le Mans Series, while Jos Verstappen became the test driver for the Honda F1 project, which was later aborted.

Finally, Minardi also fielded a completely new driver pairing: Luca Badoer (who had last driven for Forti in but became Ferrari test driver in the following years) and the third rookie driver, reigning Open Fortuna by Nissan champion Marc Gené. Their previous drivers Shinji Nakano and Esteban Tuero became a test driver for Jordan and driver in the Argentinian TC 2000 Championship, respectively.

====Mid-season changes====
A wrist injury to Luca Badoer led to Prost test driver Stéphane Sarrazin making his F1 debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix. It would end up being the Frenchman&#x27;s only ever race in the series.

Mika Salo, driving for Arrows in , was left without a full-time drive for 1999, but he later served as an injury replacement for both Ricardo Zonta for three races (after his accident during practice of the Brazilian Grand Prix), and Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher for six races after the latter broke his legs at Silverstone. He scored one second place and one third for Ferrari.

==Calendar==
The 1999 FIA Formula One World Championship comprised the following 16 races.
===Calendar changes and proposed races===
* The Malaysian Grand Prix was added to the calendar, held at a newly built circuit in Sepang.
* There were proposals for a Chinese Grand Prix to be held at the Zhuhai International Circuit. The race was included on the provisional calendar, with 21 March as its date, released on 15 October 1998. The race was removed from the calendar on 20 December 1998, due to unspecified problems. The race was proposed to be moved to the autumn but this did not occur. The Chinese Grand Prix ultimately joined the calendar in 2004, with the event held at the Shanghai International Circuit.
* The Argentine Grand Prix was added to the calendar on 20 December 1998 as a replacement for the cancelled Chinese Grand Prix, to be held at the Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez as the second round of the season on 28 March, but was cancelled as well because of disagreements between the organizer and the commercial rights holder. This resulted in a five-week gap between the year&#x27;s opening two races.
* The race at the Nurburgring was held under the European Grand Prix title once more, having been held under the Luxembourg Grand Prix title in the and season.

==Regulation changes==
For 1999, there were only minor changes to the technical regulations.

* The grooved tires introduced in 1998 now had four grooves on all tires; the front tires previously had three.
* The front tyres were made a bit narrower: maximum instead of . The maximum width of the rear tyres remained at .
* Wheels also were required to be tethered to the chassis in order to prevent them flying off in a crash.
* Frontal crash tests would be conducted at , up from .

==Season summary==

===Rounds 1 to 4===
The first round of the championship was in Australia and, unsurprisingly, the two McLarens of Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard started on the front row. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher qualified in third. Just like last year&#x27;s final race, however, Schumacher stalled on the warm-up lap and had to start at the back of the grid. So the McLarens were first and second into the first corner and pulled away, until both suddenly broke down: Coulthard when his gearbox failed and Häkkinen with electrical trouble. This left Eddie Irvine in the second Ferrari to take his first ever win ahead of Jordan&#x27;s Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher in the Williams.

After the cancellation of two proposed races left an unusual five-week gap in the calendar, the Grand Prix circus struck down in Brazil. Häkkinen and Coulthard started 1–2 again, with home hero Rubens Barrichello in third for Stewart. This time, Coulthard faltered at the start and he had to be pushed into the pitlane. He rejoined three laps down on the rest of the field. Häkkinen looked dominant, but when he got stuck in third gear, he was passed by Barrichello and Michael Schumacher. Barrichello was on a two-stopper and pitted early, leaving Schumacher in first, only to be jumped by a recovering Häkkinen during the pit stops. Häkkinen won ahead of Schumacher, and Frentzen took third after Barrichello&#x27;s engine blew up.

The first European race of the season took place at Imola, and even though the tifosi were out in full force for Ferrari, McLaren locked out the front row of the grid for the third successive race. Schumacher and Irvine were confined to the second row. Häkkinen, who was on a two-stopper, raced away from the field early on, only to lose control and crash on the 18th lap. This left Coulthard and Schumacher to battle it out, and the German jumped his rival in the stops to win, sending the tifosi wild. Coulthard came home in second and Barrichello took third after Irvine retired with an engine failure.

Häkkinen took pole again at Monaco, but this time, Schumacher prevented a lockout of the front row. Schumacher actually beat Häkkinen on the run to the first corner and then pulled away. Both Irvine and Coulthard gained a place when Häkkinen went up an escape road at Mirabeau, but soon after, Coulthard retired from third with a mechanical failure. Schumacher won by half a minute, with Irvine making it a Ferrari 1–2, and Häkkinen had to be content with the last podium spot.

With a quarter of the season gone, Schumacher led the championship with 26 points and teammate Irvine was second with 18. Häkkinen was third with 14, 12 points behind Schumacher, and only one point ahead of fourth-placed Frentzen. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari with 44 points had a big lead over McLaren with 20, and Jordan with 16.

===Rounds 5 to 8===
For the next race in Spain, Mika Häkkinen took pole position as usual ahead of Eddie Irvine, teammate David Coulthard and Michael Schumacher. Both Ferraris got away poorly, Irvine was passed by Coulthard and both were passed by Jacques Villeneuve in the BAR. The McLarens disappeared into the distance and cruised to a 1–2 finish (Häkkinen before Coulthard), while the Ferraris finally got by Villeneuve at the pit stops, Schumacher finishing third.

It was at the Canadian GP that Häkkinen&#x27;s string of poles was broken, the Finn being pushed to second by Schumacher. The front two maintained their positions at the start and pulled away. Schumacher led until he hit the infamous Wall of Champions and retired. After one of the safety car periods, Coulthard tried to overtake Irvine, but they collided and spun off. Coulthard&#x27;s miseries ensued when he ignored the red light at the end of the pit lane and was handed a stop-go penalty. All this left Heinz-Harald Frentzen in second, only for him to crash heavily with a brake failure 4 laps from the end. This brought out the safety car until the end of the race, thus making it the first ever race to finish behind the safety car. Häkkinen won from a surprising Giancarlo Fisichella and the recovering Irvine.

Qualifying for the next race in France was disrupted by rain, and it resulted in Rubens Barrichello taking pole ahead of Jean Alesi&#x27;s Sauber and Olivier Panis&#x27;s Prost. Coulthard was fourth, Schumacher sixth and Häkkinen way down in 14th. The race was no drier, and the entire race was run in wet conditions. Barrichello led for the first few laps until Coulthard passed him, only for the Scot to retire with a gearbox failure. Häkkinen quickly charged up to second, only to spin and undo his hard work. Schumacher was now second, and soon passed Barrichello to take the lead. He pulled away, but then suffered an electrical problem, which cost him a lot of time and handed the lead back to Barrichello. Nearing the end of the race, Häkkinen completed his comeback by passing Barrichello to lead, but then both of them, with most other front-runners, had to stop for extra fuel. Frentzen started with a full tank and took the second win of his career, ahead of Häkkinen and Barrichello.

It seemed that normal service resumed in Great Britain, with Häkkinen on pole ahead of Schumacher and Coulthard. Häkkinen started well, but Schumacher was passed by Coulthard and Irvine. Although the race was suspended, because two cars were stalled on the grid, Schumacher raced down to Stowe corner and tried to retake Irvine&#x27;s place, when his brakes failed and he was pitched him into the tire barrier at 320 kph (200 mph). Schumacher sustained a broken leg and thus his potential as a Drivers&#x27; World Championship contender was cut short. After the restart, Häkkinen pulled away from Irvine and Coulthard and looked set to win until one of his rear wheels suddenly became detached. This led to his retirement and handed the lead to Coulthard, who had jumped Irvine in the stops. Coulthard went on to take a victory on home soil, ahead of Irvine and Ralf Schumacher.

With half of the championship complete, Häkkinen led the championship with 40 points. Schumacher was second with 32, but he was expected to miss the rest of the season. Irvine also stood on 32 points and suddenly had to become the new team leader. Frentzen was fourth with 26 and Coulthard was fifth with 22. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with 64, two ahead of McLaren with 62. Jordan were third with 31.

===Rounds 9 to 12===
The news before the round in Austria was that Mika Salo was hired as Michael Schumacher&#x27;s replacement. The two McLarens were dominant in qualifying per usual: Mika Häkkinen on pole with David Coulthard second. Eddie Irvine started in third and Salo in seventh for his debut with Ferrari. Häkkinen got off well, but was tipped into a spin at the second corner by his teammate. He sustained no damage, but was demoted to last place. Coulthard led for most of the race, but Irvine jumped him in the second round of pit stops to take the win ahead of the Scot. Häkkinen charged back to finish third.

The German GP saw Häkkinen taking his eighth pole of the season. This time, Heinz-Harald Frentzen split the McLarens to start in second place. Häkkinen raced away and Coulthard passed Frentzen, but Salo, starting in fourth, actually got in front of both of them. Coulthard put Salo under pressure and tried to pass, but hit the Ferrari&#x27;s tire and damaged his front wing, which forced him to pit for repairs. Häkkinen was cruising, but his refuelling equipment malfunctioned during the stops, and the delay pushed him down to fourth. He repassed Frentzen and set off after the Ferraris, only to suffer a puncture and crashed into the wall. Irvine was let through by Salo and took his second consecutive win, with Salo making it a Ferrari 1–2, and Frentzen finished third.

Round eleven took place in Hungary and Häkkinen took pole as usual, with Irvine alongside him and Coulthard third. Häkkinen and Irvine quickly raced away, while Coulthard got passed by Giancarlo Fisichella and Frentzen. Coulthard jumped both drivers in the stops and then chased after Irvine. The Ulsterman cracked under the pressure with eight laps left, by running wide and thus settling for third position. Häkkinen cruised to victory and Coulthard completed McLaren&#x27;s 1–2.

The field went to Belgium next and Häkkinen took his tenth pole of the season, with Coulthard in second and Frentzen third. At the start, Häkkinen got away slowly and opened the door for Coulthard. The McLarens touched, but Coulthard came out on top. He was never headed and eased to victory, with Häkkinen finishing second and Frentzen third. Irvine finished fourth.

With three-quarters of the season complete, Häkkinen led the championship with 60 points, but Irvine with 59 was only 1 point behind him. Coulthard was third with 46, and in with an outside chance. Frentzen was fourth with 40 and Schumacher, not having raced since the British GP was still on 32. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, consecutive 1–2 finishes had given McLaren the lead with 106 points. Ferrari with 97 was only 9 points behind them. Jordan was third with 47.

===Rounds 13 to 16===
In Italy, Mika Häkkinen took his eleventh and what would be his last pole position of the season, ahead of Heinz-Harald Frentzen and David Coulthard. He led into the first corner and pulled away, helped by Alessandro Zanardi, who got up to second but then held up his rivals. Häkkinen was set to win until he spun off at the first corner on lap 30, handing the lead to Frentzen who went on to win ahead of Ralf Schumacher in the Williams and Mika Salo in the Ferrari. This promoted Frentzen to third place in the championship, at the cost of Coulthard, and his sixth place brought Eddie Irvine level with Häkkinen at the top of the standings.

At the European Grand Prix, Frentzen took his second and last career pole, ahead of Coulthard and Häkkinen. After two aborted starts, Frentzen led Häkkinen and Coulthard into the first corner, but at the back of the pack, Damon Hill got away slow because of an electrical failure. This caused Alexander Wurz to hit Pedro Diniz. The Sauber driver rolled upside down and his rollbar failed, but Diniz escaped uninjured. After 15 laps, a slight drizzle fell and Häkkinen pitted for rain tires. He was the only one and it turned out to be a mistake. He lost a lot of time when he had to pit again for dry tires and he rejoined a lap down. Irvine had a slow stop of 30 seconds when his team couldn&#x27;t find the fourth wheel to put on and with half of the race gone, Frentzen was leading Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher. Frentzen&#x27;s race cruelly ended with an electrical failure after his first stop and the new leader Coulthard spun off into retirement when the rain truly arrived. This handed the lead to Ralf until he suffered a puncture and fell back to fifth. Giancarlo Fisichella inherited the lead, but he also spun off and retired, so Johnny Herbert in the Stewart gained first place. And on a drying track, he held on to finish ahead of Jarno Trulli in the Prost and teammate Rubens Barrichello. Luca Badoer was set for a points finish for Minardi, but he suffered a gearbox failure. Häkkinen finished fifth and Irvine sixth, separating them by two points in the championship.

The first ever Malaysian GP was the host of the penultimate round. Michael Schumacher had recovered and replaced Salo. He took pole ahead of Irvine, with Coulthard and Häkkinen third and fourth. At the start, Schumacher handed the lead to Irvine for the championship and slowed down to keep both McLarens behind. Coulthard finally got in front, only for his car to break down. Schumacher kept Häkkinen behind to complete a Ferrari 1–2 finish, giving Irvine a four-point lead going into the last race. After the race, the Ferrari cars were found to be illegal by an FIA official and were disqualified, which would make Häkkinen the world champion instantly. However, Ferrari won their case of appeal and their results were reinstated. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari led with 118 points, in front of McLaren with 114; Jordan with 58 were a lonely third.

The championship decider took place in Japan. Häkkinen qualified in second, behind Schumacher, while Irvine crashed in qualifying and was only fifth. Häkkinen took the lead at the start, while Irvine was fourth behind Olivier Panis. Häkkinen and Schumacher got away, while Panis held up the others. At the first round of stops, Irvine got in front of Panis but then had to deal with Coulthard. The McLaren slowed his pace and held Irvine up to increase the gap to Häkkinen. Irvine was finally released when Coulthard spun off, but was well over a minute behind the lead. Schumacher was within five seconds of Häkkinen, and piled on the pressure, but Häkkinen kept him at bay to win the race.

Reigning champion Häkkinen was awarded the 1999 Drivers&#x27; Championship with 76 points, two points ahead of Irvine. Frentzen was third (54 points), ahead of Coulthard (48 points) and Michael Schumacher (44 points). In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari beat McLaren by four points. Jordan ended up in third.

<text>The 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 52nd season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1998 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1998 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 8 March and ended on 1 November.

The season saw a large shuffling of the pecking order, with McLaren emerging as the fastest constructor. After the factory withdrawal of Renault and the departure of designer Adrian Newey to McLaren, the Williams team and Jacques Villeneuve were unable to defend their respective championships. Williams suffered their first winless season since .

Mika Häkkinen won his first World Drivers&#x27; Championship and McLaren won the World Constructors&#x27; Championship for the first time since . McLaren would wait a further 26 years before their next title was secured in 2024.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship.
† All engines were 3.0 litre, V10 configuration.

===Team changes===
At the end of , Renault withdrew as a direct engine supplier from Formula One and thus marked the first season since that Renault-branded engines were absent due to the company&#x27;s privatisation plan. As a result, the two teams running Renault engines were forced to source alternative suppliers. Williams opted to run engines supplied by Mecachrome, who were working with Renault to develop the most recent iteration of their RS9 engine rebadged with the Mecachrome name. Benetton sourced a similar rebadged Renault engine from Playlife. Neither Williams nor Benetton were competitive to the same level as in previous seasons. Renault themselves would invest in Benetton for , before buying the team outright in . They would not supply engines to other competing teams again until .

Arrows had bought out Brian Hart&#x27;s preparation company to build their own engines. They would do so as well for .

The Prost and Jordan teams swapped their engine suppliers from 1997: Prost now used Peugeot, whilst Jordan used Mugen-Honda.

Minardi switched from Hart to Ford engines.

===Driver changes===
Gerhard Berger retired at the end of after fourteen years in F1, leaving a vacant seat at Benetton. The team also opted not to renew Jean Alesi&#x27;s contract, so the Frenchman signed a two-year deal to join Johnny Herbert at Sauber. As their replacements, Benetton signed Giancarlo Fisichella from Jordan and Alexander Wurz, who had already substituted for Berger for three races in 1997.

Jordan replaced Fisichella by signing World Champion Damon Hill to partner Ralf Schumacher. To fill his Hill&#x27;s seat, Arrows secured the services of Tyrrell&#x27;s Mika Salo alongside Pedro Diniz. Tyrrell also parted ways with Jos Verstappen in the off-season, despite Ken Tyrrell wanting him to stay. However, new owners British American Tobacco preferred to hire Brazilian Ricardo Rosset, who had briefly raced for the now-defunct Lola team in 1997. They promoted test driver Toranosuke Takagi to fill the second seat. Verstappen returned to F1 midway through 1998 with Stewart, while Lola&#x27;s other driver, Vincenzo Sospiri, found a home in the IndyCar Series.

Prost retained Olivier Panis, but dropped second driver Shinji Nakano and replaced him with Jarno Trulli. Trulli had started 1997 with Minardi but then substituted for Panis when he broke his leg at the Canadian Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Nakano joined Trulli&#x27;s old team, Minardi, to replace his retiring countryman Ukyo Katayama. He was partnered by rookie Esteban Tuero, who was promoted from a testing role as he was preferred to the outgoing Tarso Marques. Marques would eventually return to F1 in , also with Minardi.

====Mid-season changes====
Jan Magnussen was dropped by Stewart after the Canadian Grand Prix, following a series of underwhelming performances (including crashing into and eliminating his teammate Rubens Barrichello on lap 1 at Imola). He was replaced by Jos Verstappen, who had been out of a drive since leaving Tyrrell at the end of 1997.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
*The Portuguese Grand Prix was originally scheduled near the end of the season, to be held at the Estoril circuit on 11 October. The race was cancelled as the government refused to pay for the required safety upgrades. The cancellation left a gap of five weeks to the final race in Japan.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
The 1998 season brought about two significant technical changes to reduce cornering speeds and aid overtaking:
* The reintroduction of grooved tyres to replace slicks for the first time since . The front tyres had three grooves, the rear tyres four. This was done to decrease cornering speeds and thus, increase safety. Grooved tyres would remain in Formula One until the reintroduction of slicks in . For 1998, both McLaren and Benetton switched from Goodyear to Bridgestone tyres, as the Japanese manufacturer expanded to work with six of the eleven teams in their second year competing in the sport. The two top teams from 1997, Williams and Ferrari, opted to retain Goodyear tyres. This would result in the two championship protagonist teams working with different tyre manufacturers.
* The reduction of the cars&#x27; track, from to . This would give teams less room to play with to create downforce and give drivers more space on the track.

Quite a list of regulations were drafted up with regards to the brakes. The goal was to limit braking performance, thereby improving possibilities of overtaking and reducing costs.

The cameras mounted on top of the engine covers, as seen on selected cars from 1995 to 1997, were made mandatory for each car in 1998, and changed from an I-shape to a more aerodynamic T-shape. This design has remained largely unchanged since.

====Mid-season changes====
&quot;X wings&quot;, a pair of tall aerodynamic appendages mounted at the front of each sidepod and first seen on the Tyrrell 025 in 1997, were banned before the Spanish Grand Prix. The teams that used them before the ban were Ferrari, Jordan, Prost, Sauber, and Tyrrell.

===Sporting regulations===
In , a driver was allowed a maximum of 30 laps free practice per day. This limit was abolished for 1998.

==Season summary==

===Rounds 1 to 6===
When the season commenced, it was immediately clear that McLaren had adapted to the rule changes best, with their drivers locking out the front row of the grid at the opening race of the season in Australia and both being more than half a second clear of Michael Schumacher in the Ferrari. Mika Häkkinen started on pole position and led up to lap 36, when he misheard a call to come into the pits. Teammate David Coulthard took the lead, but moved over to allow Häkkinen to pass, honouring a pre-race agreement that the driver leading at the first corner could win the race. The result was protested but was held up by the WMSC.

The McLaren drivers finished 1-2 again in Brazil, and in the same order. But once again, controversy was not far away: a protest was lodged regarding the McLaren braking system. It was suggested to allow the drivers to brake front and rear wheels independently, contravening the rules. McLaren agreed not to run the system, but remained dominant in the race.

With Goodyear making steps forward before Argentina, Schumacher was able to take his first win of the season there. Häkkinen finished a distant second and Coulthard only managed sixth after he was tipped into a spin by Schumacher early in the race.

Coulthard bounced back in Imola by gaining pole position and winning the race ahead of the Ferrari&#x27;s of Schumacher and Eddie Irvine. Häkkinen suffered his first retirement of the season due to a gearbox failure.

It seemed that normal service resumed in Spain, however, where the McLaren took another 1-2 finish led by Häkkinen. A further win for Häkkinen in Monaco gave him a seventeen-point lead over Coulthard with Schumacher a further five points behind.

===Rounds 7 to 12===
Michael Schumacher climbed back in the standings by winning the next three races, while mistakes and mechanical failures cost both Häkkinen and Coulthard points. After the British Grand Prix, Schumacher had closed the gap to Häkkinen to just two points, while Coulthard was 26 points behind his teammate and looking unlikely to be able to fight for the championship.

Consecutive wins in Austria and Germany for Häkkinen, however, proved that McLaren still had the strongest car. Finally, a strategic master stroke in Hungary allowed Schumacher to take the win, with Häkkinen only managing sixth, and close the championship gap again, to just seven points.

===Rounds 13 to 16===
The start of a typically rain-filled Belgian Grand Prix saw one of the worst accidents in Formula One history, with over half the cars on the grid crashing into each other after the first corner. Four of the drivers were unable to take the restart, which took place almost an hour later, due to lack of spare cars. An action-packed race saw Mika Häkkinen spin out into retirement at the restart and saw Michael Schumacher crashing into David Coulthard when trying to lap him. The path was then clear for world champion Damon Hill to take Jordan&#x27;s first ever win, followed by teammate Ralf Schumacher in second.

Schumacher bounced back to take a surprise victory in Italy. Häkkinen initially followed in second, but after two spins caused by brake problems, could only manage fourth. The rivals were now level in points with two races to go and Ferrari was back into contention for the Constructors&#x27; Championship (just ten points behind on McLaren).

For the next race at the Nürburgring, Häkkinen managed to beat Schumacher in a straight fight. And the season concluded in Japan, where Häkkinen won without any challenge from Schumacher, who stalled on the grid and retired from a blown tyre later in the race.

This gave Häkkinen his first Drivers&#x27; Championship and McLaren their eighth Constructors&#x27; Championship. Williams, champions of , experienced a disappointing season overall, with only two podium finishes for reigning champion Jacques Villeneuve and one for Heinz-Harald Frentzen. In Japan, they did manage to secure third in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, ahead of Jordan and Benetton.

<doc id="1137695" wikidata="Q69750" url="?curid=1137695" title="1997 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 1997 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 51st season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1997 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1997 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a seventeen-race series that commenced on 9 March and ended on 26 October.

The Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Jacques Villeneuve under controversial circumstances: championship leader Michael Schumacher deliberately rammed him whilst trying to defend his race lead in the final race. Schumacher came to a halt in the gravel while Villeneuve finished third, giving him enough points to secure the drivers&#x27; championship. Schumacher was later deemed at fault for the accident by the FIA. He kept his five race wins, but was stripped of his 2nd place in the championship, promoting Villeneuve&#x27;s Williams teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen to second in the championship.

The Constructors&#x27; Championship was awarded to Williams-Renault.

As of 2024, this is the last championship for a non-European driver, the last Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; championships for Williams, and the last championship won on Goodyear tyres. It was also the last championship for a Renault-powered driver, until Fernando Alonso&#x27;s championship in .

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1997 FIA Formula One World Championship.

*† All engines were 3.0-litre configuration.

===Team changes===
* Stewart Grand Prix made their Formula One debut. They entered with factory backing of the Ford Motor Company.
* Lola also entered the sport. They had planned to debut in , but hurried through the design phase, under heavy commercial pressure from their title sponsor Mastercard. After both Lola drivers failed to qualify in the first race, sponsors left and the team had to withdraw from the championship.
* After twenty years in the sport, Ligier was sold from Flavio Briatore to Alain Prost and became Prost.
* Footwork reverted to the &quot;Arrows&quot; name after a buy-out by Tom Walkinshaw and switched from Hart engines to Yamaha.
* Tyrrell changed their engines as well, swapping from Yamaha to Ford.
* Sauber engaged in a partnership with new sponsor Petronas and formed Sauber Petronas Engineering. They secured the licensing rights to engine and gearbox components from Ferrari, allowing them to build and run nearly identical units to those used in the Ferraris. The engines were branded as &quot;Petronas&quot;, in deference to the role the company played in their development. This marked the first season since that Ferrari supplied engines to more than one team in the sport.
* Finally, on the front of tyre suppliers, Bridgestone entered into F1 and supplied tyres to Arrows, Prost, Minardi, Stewart and Lola.

===Driver changes===
The biggest news at the beginning of the 1997 season was Damon Hill, 1996 champion, being dropped by Williams in favour of Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Hill was partnered at his new team, Arrows, with Brazilian Pedro Diniz, who was signed from Ligier. This was the only time in Arrows&#x27; history that the team had the number 1 on their car after signing the reigning World Champion.

Arrows&#x27; former drivers Jos Verstappen and Ricardo Rosset joined the Tyrrell and Lola team, respectively. Rosset was joined by Benetton&#x27;s test driver Vincenzo Sospiri.

Reliant on their Japanese engine partners Mugen-Honda, Japanese driver Shinji Nakano joined Prost besides Olivier Panis, who was retained from .

Thanks in part to the technical deal between Sauber and Ferrari, Ferrari test driver Nicola Larini signed with Sauber. Larini replaced Frentzen, who had moved to Williams.

Jordan signed debutant Ralf Schumacher, Michael&#x27;s younger brother. He was rumoured to be partnered with Nigel Mansell, but the 1992 champion rejected the offer. So the team went for Giancarlo Fisichella, who drove his first races for Minardi in .

Jordan&#x27;s former driver Rubens Barrichello moved to newcomer Stewart Grand Prix, with his 1996 ex-teammate Martin Brundle unable to find a seat for 1997 and reluctantly leaving the sport as a driver. Stewart also signed Jan Magnussen, who had filled in at McLaren for an unwell Mika Häkkinen in and had raced in the CART series in 1996.

Verstappen, moving from Arrows to Tyrrell, replaced Ukyo Katayama, who found a place at Minardi. Katayama replaced Pedro Lamy, who moved into the FIA GT Championship. Alongside him, Italian rising star Jarno Trulli filled the final seat in the 1997 championship.

The Italian team Forti ceased to exist midway through , and neither of their drivers, Luca Badoer and Andrea Montermini, were able to find a Formula One racing seat for 1997. Badoer moved into FIA GT, while Montermini became a test driver for Lola. Badoer would eventually return to F1 in with Minardi. 

==== Mid-season changes====
* The Lola team folded after the Australian Grand Prix, leaving Ricardo Rosset and Vincenzo Sospiri out of a drive. Rosset returned to F1 in with Tyrrell, while Sospiri saw out the 1997 season in IndyCar with Team Scandia.
* A series of disagreements with Peter Sauber saw Nicola Larini leave Sauber after the Monaco Grand Prix. He was replaced by Gianni Morbidelli, who had last raced in F1 with Footwork in and had spent testing for Jordan. 
* Gerhard Berger fell ill before the Canadian Grand Prix and was unable to race for Benetton. He was replaced by countryman Alexander Wurz. Berger ultimately missed three races as he recovered from the illness and the death of his father, before returning at the German Grand Prix. Wurz would get a full-time drive with the team in , as Berger retired at the end of this season. 
* During the Canadian Grand Prix, Prost&#x27;s Olivier Panis crashed heavily and broke his leg. He was replaced by Minardi driver Jarno Trulli, who in turn was replaced by Tarso Marques. Marques who had also made some appearances for the Minardi team the previous year. Panis missed seven races before returning at the Luxembourg Grand Prix. Trulli would join him as a full-time Prost driver in .
* Between the Canadian and French Grands Prix, Gianni Morbidelli had an accident in testing and broke his arm, meaning Sauber had to make their second substitution of the year. They brought in test driver Norberto Fontana, who completed the next three races before Morbidelli&#x27;s return at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix. Morbidelli suffered another testing accident following the Japanese Grand Prix, so Fontana competed again at the season-ending European Grand Prix.

==Calendar==
The following seventeen Grands Prix took place in 1997.
===Calendar changes===
* The Austrian Grand Prix returned to the calendar for the first time since 1987.
* The Portuguese Grand Prix was originally scheduled as the final round of the season, to be held at the Estoril circuit on 26 October. It was cancelled and replaced by the European Grand Prix at Circuito de Jerez in neighbouring Spain after the owners of the Estoril circuit failed to make requested changes to it.
* The Luxembourg Grand Prix was added to the World Championship for the first time, after being held as a non-championship race from 1949 until 1952. Despite the race title, this race would actually be held not in Luxembourg itself but instead at the Nürburgring in nearby Germany. The title of German Grand Prix was already assigned to the race in Hockenheim and the European Grand Prix was already hosted in Jerez.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
Except for a more detailed description of the impact absorbing structures at the front and rear of the car, there were no changes for the 1997 season.

===Sporting and event regulations===
A revised Concorde agreement, laying out the rules for the 1997 to seasons, was signed by the FIA and eight of the eleven F1 teams that participated in the season. These were some of the changes made to the sporting regulations:
* The maximum number of races per year was increased to 17, up from 16.
* Friday free practice was abolished. The Saturday practice sessions were extended to one hour each. The number of practice laps allowed was no longer limited. These changes seem to have been reversed at a later time, as the 1997 Sporting regulations still showed two practice sessions, two days before the race, and a limit of 30 laps per day.)
* Two tyre choices were permitted in practice, but one had to be selected to use in qualifying and race.

From this season on, the regulations gave room for starts behind the Safety Car if the track was wet.

==Season summary==

===Rounds 1 to 4===
The season started in Australia, with Canadian Jacques Villeneuve taking the first pole position of the season. The moment was short-lived, however, as Villeneuve was out of the race at the first corner, when he collided with Johnny Herbert. McLaren&#x27;s David Coulthard went on to win the race, the second of his career, with Michael Schumacher finishing second and Mika Häkkinen finishing in third place.

Villeneuve once again took pole position in Brazil, and once again he was off at the first corner. Luckily for him, the race was restarted, and the Canadian took the lead on lap 49 from Gerhard Berger. The Austrian finished second and Olivier Panis continued his impressive form from 1996 with third place.

For the third time in a row, Jacques Villeneuve took pole position in Argentina. This time, it was Michael Schumacher who was out at the first turn, when he collided with Rubens Barrichello. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Eddie Irvine went on to challenge Villeneuve for the lead and he made several attempts to pass, but failed and had to settle for second. Debutant Ralf Schumacher managed to get onto the podium in third place.

Villeneuve continued his run of consecutive pole positions in San Marino, but it was his German teammate Frentzen that won his first and only Grand Prix for Williams. After Villeneuve retired with a gearbox failure, Frentzen was joined on the podium by the Ferraris of Schumacher and Irvine.

At this point, Villeneuve was on top of the standings with 20 points. He was followed by Schumacher with 14 and five drivers in a shared third place, all with 10 points.

===Rounds 5 to 9===
Heinz-Harald Frentzen managed to end Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s run of pole positions at the Monaco Grand Prix. For the second time in successive seasons, the race was run in very wet conditions. Michael Schumacher won his first race of the season. Rubens Barrichello came home in second and gave Stewart not only their first podium finish, but their first points finish and their first finish of any kind. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Eddie Irvine took the final step on the podium for the second time in a row.

In Spain, Williams was back on top in qualifying: Villeneuve took his fifth pole and Frentzen joined him on the front row. Villeneuve went on to win the race, with fellow French-speaking drivers, Olivier Panis and Jean Alesi, coming second and third respectively. Panis was actually closing on the leader with rapid pace, but got held up by Irvine, which got him served a stop-go penalty.

In a slight shift of power, Michael Schumacher took pole position and the race win in the next two Grands Prix. In Canada, he was joined on the podium by Benetton&#x27;s Jean Alesi and Jordan&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella. In France, he saw Frentzen in the Williams and teammate Irvine next to him.

Villeneuve earned his sixth pole position of the season in Britain, with teammate Frentzen partnering him on the front row. Villeneuve saw Mika Häkkinen take the lead when he was stuck in the pit lane for half a minute. Häkkinen, however, retired with a blown engine and Villeneuve went on to win the race, with Alesi in second and Alexander Wurz, filling in for Gerhard Berger, coming third. It was an all-Renault-powered podium. Schumacher failed to complete the race after he retired with a wheel bearing problem.

In the championship, Schumacher had the lead with 47 points, closely followed by Villeneuve with 43. Third place was being contested by Alesi (21 points) , Frentzen (19) and Irvine (18).

===Rounds 10 to 14===
On his return, Gerhard Berger managed to get pole for the German Grand Prix. Fastest lap and race victory followed, which would ultimately be Berger&#x27;s and Benetton&#x27;s final win. Championship leader Michael Schumacher came second and Mika Häkkinen came third.

The next race, in Hungary, was one of the most memorable races in the 1997 season. Schumacher took pole, with Villeneuve partnering him on the front row. champion Damon Hill in the Arrows had only qualified as high as ninth this season, but got up to third place on the Hungaroring. The start of the race saw Hill overtake the Williams ahead of him, and on lap ten, the Brit overtook the leading Scuderia Ferrari. Hill kept the lead until the last part of the race, when he reported that problems with his car. On the final lap, Jacques Villeneuve took the lead, achieving a milestone 100th Grand Prix victory for Williams.

After two very exciting Grands Prix, the fans&#x27; hopes were high for Belgium. Villeneuve took pole position, with Alesi in the Benetton behind him and his championship rival, Michael Schumacher, in third. Villeneuve had dominated the morning warm-up, held in hot, dry weather. But when heavy rain fell with half an hour to go before the race start, his championship rival, Michael Schumacher, decided to run his spare car, which was set up for wet conditions. The front two started the race on full-wet tyres, while the rest of the grid used the intermediates. This turned out to be the right call. After the first safety car start in Formula One history, Schumacher overtook Alesi and Villeneuve within two laps and by lap 12, his lead had stretched to over a minute. Villeneuve dropped down to 16th place and only recovered to fifth. Schumacher won and saw Giancarlo Fisichella and Heinz-Harald Frentzen next to him on the podium.

Alesi scored his first and only pole position of the season in Italy, with Frentzen starting second. Villeneuve and Schumacher took off in fourth and ninth, respectively. Coulthard, who started in sixth, got up to third position at the start and moved into the lead during the pit stops. He scored his second win of the season, ahead of Alesi and Frentzen. This was the only race in the year without Villeneuve and Schumacher on the podium.

In Austria, Villeneuve managed to get his seventh pole position of the season. The Canadian was partnered on the front row by Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen. Häkkinen actually took the lead but, like it happened at Silverstone, had to retire with a blown engine. Schumacher had again started in ninth, but recovered to third during the race. However, he was handed a stop-go penalty for overtaking under yellow flags and fell down to sixth at the finish. Villeneuve went on to win the Grand Prix, with Coulthard and Frentzen joining him on the podium.

The gap between the championship rivals had now closed up to just one point. Frentzen (31 points) was fighting Coulthard (30) and Alesi (28) over third place.

===Rounds 15 to 17===
At the Luxembourg Grand Prix, held at the Nürburgring in Germany, Mika Häkkinen managed to earn pole. It was his first career pole, McLaren&#x27;s first pole since and Mercedes&#x27;s first since their return to Formula One in . Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher started in fifth, but was taken out at the first corner. Häkkinen&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard shot up the order and McLaren looked set for a 1–2 finish, until both cars broke down in quick succession. Williams&#x27; Jacques Villeneuve was therefore gifted a win (which would end up to be the last of his career). For the first time since Spain, Villeneuve now had the lead in the championship. Jean Alesi and Heinz-Harald Frentzen completed the podium, making it, for the second time in the 1997 season, an all-Renault-powered podium.

Villeneuve continued his strong form by taking his eighth pole position in the year in Japan. However, during qualifying, he was deemed to have ignored the yellow flags. A disqualification hang over him and with his appeal being judged, he started the race and finished fifth. Michael Schumacher won the race, ahead of Williams&#x27; Frentzen and Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine. Williams dropped their appeal after the race, leaving Japan with no points for Villeneuve and seeing Schumacher again one point ahead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

The European Grand Prix at Jerez saw a noteworthy qualifying session in which three drivers (Villeneuve, Schumacher, and Frentzen) all set the same fastest time. Villeneuve was awarded pole position, since he had set the time first, and this would be the final pole of his F1 career. At the start of the race, Schumacher got away well, overtaking Villeneuve to take the lead. By lap 48, Villeneuve was catching up and attempted to overtake. Braking later than the German at the &quot;Dry Sac&quot; corner, he had the inside line and was slightly ahead. Schumacher then turned into him and the Ferrari&#x27;s front right wheel connected with the sidepod of the Williams. Schumacher retired on the spot. Villeneuve dropped to third, but it earned him four points, enough to take the 1997 Drivers&#x27; Championship. Mika Häkkinen went on to take his first ever career victory and with Coulthard finishing second, McLaren scored the only 1-2 finish by a team during the 1997 season. 

After the race, Schumacher was deemed by the FIA to have caused an avoidable accident and was disqualified from the championship, although his race results (grid positions, finishing positions, points) were held up. This meant no damage to Ferrari&#x27;s constructor points, but Williams still won the 1997 Constructors&#x27; Championship with a difference of 21 points. In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Frentzen moved up to second, six points ahead of both Coulthard and Alesi.

<text>The 1996 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 50th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. The championship commenced on 10 March and ended on 13 October after sixteen races. Two World Championship titles were awarded, one for Drivers and one for Constructors.

Damon Hill won the Drivers&#x27; Championship two years after being beaten by a point by Michael Schumacher, making him the first son of a World Champion (his father Graham having won the title in and ) to have won the title himself as well as the only until Nico Rosberg, son of 1982 champion Keke Rosberg, won the title 34 years later in 2016. Hill, who had finished runner-up for the past two seasons, was seriously threatened only by his teammate, newcomer Jacques Villeneuve, the 1995 IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 champion. Williams-Renault easily won the Constructors&#x27; title, as there was no other competitor strong enough to post a consistent challenge throughout the championship. This was also the beginning of the end of Williams&#x27;s 1990s dominance, as it was announced that Hill and designer Adrian Newey would depart at the conclusion of the season, with engine manufacturer Renault also leaving after 1997.

Two-time defending world champion Michael Schumacher had moved to Ferrari and despite numerous reliability problems, they had gradually developed into a front-running team by the end of the season. Defending Constructors&#x27; Champion Benetton began their decline towards the middle of the grid, having lost key personnel due to Schumacher&#x27;s departure, and failed to win a race. Olivier Panis took the only victory of his career at the Monaco Grand Prix.

This was the last championship for a British driver until Lewis Hamilton in 2008.

==Teams and drivers==
The numbering system used since 1974 was dropped. Ferrari was given the numbers 1 and 2 after hiring the defending champion Michael Schumacher, despite finishing the previous year&#x27;s Constructors&#x27; Championship in third, Benetton received numbers 3 and 4 for winning the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams got numbers 5 and 6 for finishing second, McLaren got 7 and 8 for finishing fourth, Ligier got 9 and 10 for finishing fifth, and so on, with the number 13 being skipped.

The following teams and drivers competed in the 1996 FIA Formula One World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Goodyear.
===Team changes===

* By receiving an Italian licence the defending Constructors&#x27; Champion Benetton officially became an Italian constructor, though it continued to operate from the same base in Britain.
* Jordan gained a new title sponsor in British cigarette brand Benson &amp; Hedges, who joined oil supplier Total and engine company Peugeot in the team&#x27;s official name.
* Meanwhile, Tyrrell lost their title sponsor, Finnish communications company Nokia, becoming officially known simply as Tyrrell Yamaha.
* Forti also lost the sponsorship of Italian dairy corporation Parmalat, as well as any official connection to Ford, although they continued to use Ford engines.
* Scuderia Italia decided to end their two-year working relationship with Minardi, so the team once again became known simply as Minardi Team.
* Two teams disappeared from the entry list entirely. Larrousse had missed the early races of 1995 before finally announcing their withdrawal before the San Marino Grand Prix. Gérard Larrousse claimed several times the team would reappear in 1996, but a combination of legal and financial difficulties meant this never materialised. Pacific withdrew from the sport at the end of 1995.
* Scuderia Ferrari decided to change from the V12 engine they competed with the previous season to the V-10 engine configuration which was used by most of the other teams. For the first time since , no Formula One entrants utilized a V12 engine in their car.

===Driver changes===
* Defending double world champion Michael Schumacher left Benetton to join Ferrari, citing the need for a new challenge. He displaced Jean Alesi, who moved in the opposite direction. Gerhard Berger was offered the chance to stay as Schumacher&#x27;s teammate, but eventually opted to join Alesi at Benetton. Ferrari filled the seat with Jordan&#x27;s Eddie Irvine.
* Berger&#x27;s decision to join Benetton ousted Johnny Herbert, who joined Sauber alongside Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Sauber&#x27;s other seat had been filled in 1995 by both Karl Wendlinger, who left F1 still struggling to recover fully from injuries sustained at the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix, and Jean-Christophe Boullion, who returned to his testing role at Williams.
* Williams dropped David Coulthard, instead recruiting Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve, who had won the 1995 CART Championship, to partner Damon Hill. Coulthard joined McLaren alongside Mika Häkkinen, replacing Mark Blundell, who moved into CART with PacWest Racing.
* Martin Brundle left Ligier in order to replace the Ferrari-bound Irvine at Jordan, where he would partner Rubens Barrichello. Ligier replaced him by bringing in Forti&#x27;s Pedro Diniz alongside Olivier Panis. Aguri Suzuki, who had shared Brundle&#x27;s seat in 1995, left F1 altogether.
* Footwork had an entirely new line-up in 1996, dispensing with all three of their 1995 drivers. Gianni Morbidelli became a test driver for Jordan, before returning to a race seat in 1997 with Sauber, while fellow Italian Max Papis moved to America to race in the CART Series. Taki Inoue was rumoured to have secured a drive with both Tyrrell and Minardi, but ultimately lost out on both seats and moved to sports cars. Footwork replaced them with Jos Verstappen from the now-defunct Simtek team, and 1995 International Formula 3000 runner-up Ricardo Rosset. Simtek&#x27;s other driver, Domenico Schiattarella left F1 completely.
* Luca Badoer moved from Minardi to Forti, replacing Pedro Diniz, who had gone to Ligier. As his replacement, Minardi brought in Giancarlo Fisichella, who had been racing with Alfa Romeo in the International Touring Car Championship, to partner Pedro Lamy. Badoer&#x27;s teammate at Forti would be Andrea Montermini, who had raced for the now-extinct Pacific team in 1995. He replaced Roberto Moreno, who moved into Champ Car.
* Tyrrell was the only team on the grid to have an unchanged driver line-up from 1995 with Ukyo Katayama and Mika Salo.

====Mid-season changes====

* Due to his commitments with Alfa Romeo in the International Touring Car Championship, Giancarlo Fisichella missed several races for Minardi. European Formula 3000 driver Tarso Marques raced at the Brazilian and Argentine Grands Prix, while Giovanni Lavaggi, who had raced for Pacific in 1995, replaced the pair of them from the German Grand Prix onwards due to his superior financial backing.
* Forti were declared bankrupt after the British Grand Prix, leaving both their drivers out of a drive. Luca Badoer would eventually return to F1 in 1999 with Minardi, after a spell in the FIA GT Championship, while Andrea Montermini became a test driver for the short-lived Lola team in 1997.

==Calendar==
The 1996 FIA Formula One World Championship comprised the following races: 
===Calendar changes===
*The Australian Grand Prix was moved from the Adelaide Street Circuit to the Albert Park Circuit in Port Phillip near Melbourne. The change of venue also resulted in the grand prix becoming the season opener instead of its finale.
*The Indonesian Grand Prix (renamed from the Pacific Grand Prix) was due to be held in Indonesia at the Sentul International Circuit as the final round but the race did not make the calendar as the corners were unsuitable for Formula One cars.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* In 1995, the sides of the cockpit were raised in order to provide better head protection for the driver. These sides were raised even higher (to mid-helmet height) for 1996, along with a wraparound head restraint made of foam to prevent head injuries such as those suffered by Mika Häkkinen during qualifying for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Also, the cockpit opening was made larger, with the front tip now extending to from the front wheel centre line instead of .
* Needle-like nosecone designs with a sharp point, such as the McLaren MP4/10, Forti FG01 and Tyrrell 023, were also banned in favour of more blunt nose sections.
* The minimum weight (with driver) was raised from to .
* To prevent damage to other cars&#x27; tyres, front wing endplates had to be at least thick.

===Sporting and event regulations===
* The race weekend schedule was changed for the 1996 season compared to . The number of free practice sessions was increased from the two to three with the number of laps allocated for each day increased from 23 to 30. Also, to increase the spectacle, the Friday qualifying session was dropped, with the FIA World Motor Sport Council opting to have only one qualifying session, held on Saturday afternoon and limited to 12 laps for drivers.
* This year saw the introduction of the &quot;107% rule&quot;, which meant all cars had to be within 107% of the pole position time in order to qualify for the race.
* The previous system of having a red and green light to start the race was replaced by the current system of five red lights turning on sequentially with a period of usually five seconds, then all going out simultaneously before starting the race.
* A new numbering system for cars was adopted for 1996 and remained in place until the end of 2013, when a new system was introduced. Previously, the reigning Drivers&#x27; Champion&#x27;s team had simply swapped car numbers with the previous Drivers&#x27; Champion&#x27;s team to carry numbers 1 and 2, with all other teams retaining their existing numbers. For 1996 the reigning Drivers&#x27; Champion was given number 1 and his teammate number 2 with the rest of the teams numbered in the order of their finishing position in the previous year&#x27;s Constructors&#x27; Championship. Any new teams were allocated the following numbers.
* Continued safety improvements and modifications on circuits brought the number of &quot;high risk&quot; corners on the calendar down to two.

== Season report ==
Damon Hill won the season opener in Australia from his Williams teammate Jacques Villeneuve, with Ferrari&#x27;s Eddie Irvine finishing third. Villeneuve was leading but late on in the race the team found out that Villeneuve had an oil leak and ordered him to swap places with teammate Hill.

The Brazilian Grand Prix took place in heavy rain, and was won from pole position by Damon Hill, with Jean Alesi second in a Benetton and Michael Schumacher third in a Ferrari.

Despite suffering a bout of food poisoning, Damon Hill made it three wins out of three at the Argentine Grand Prix, with Jacques Villeneuve helping Williams to their second one-two of the season. Jos Verstappen scored his only point of the season, while Andrea Montermini registered his only finish of the season. Pedro Diniz was involved in two major incidents during the race. First he collided with Luca Badoer, whose Forti was flipped and landed upside down in the gravel, forcing the marshals to bring out the safety car. Diniz managed to continue and made a pit stop as the safety car was preparing to pull in, only to retire when he came back onto the circuit and his Ligier burst into flames because a safety-valve in the fuel tank had jammed open.

The European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring in Germany was won by Jacques Villeneuve for his first F1 victory in only his fourth race. Michael Schumacher finished second, with David Coulthard third in a McLaren, just ahead of Hill.

The San Marino Grand Prix was won by Damon Hill after starting from second position. Michael Schumacher again finished second, despite his front-right brake seizing halfway around the final lap, while Gerhard Berger was third, driving for the Benetton team. Jacques Villeneuve retired near the end of the race after being hit by Jean Alesi.

Round six at Monaco was run in wet weather, causing significant attrition and setting a record for the fewest cars (three) to be running at the end of a Grand Prix. Olivier Panis scored what would be his sole career Formula One victory, earning the last Formula One victory for the Ligier team, and the first ever for engine manufacturer Mugen Motorsports, after he made the switch onto slick tyres in a well-timed pitstop. David Coulthard was second, nearly five seconds behind Panis. Johnny Herbert scored his only points of the season, finishing third in a Sauber, more than half a minute behind Coulthard.

The Spanish Grand Prix saw Michael Schumacher&#x27;s first Ferrari victory, and is generally regarded as one of the German&#x27;s finest races. In torrential rain, he produced a stunning drive, helping him to earn the nickname &quot;the Rainmaster&quot;. Schumacher recovered from a poor start to take the lead from Villeneuve on lap 13, and from then on he dominated the race, frequently lapping over three seconds faster than the remainder of the field. Jean Alesi finished second, more than 45 seconds behind the winner, with Jacques Villeneuve third. Rubens Barrichello, who was running in second place after Jacques Villeneuve and Alesi made their pit stops, put in a strong performance in this race, but was forced to retire due to a clutch problem with 20 laps remaining. After an uneventful race on his part, Heinz-Harald Frentzen finished in fourth, while Mika Häkkinen took fifth after surviving a spin off the track in the closing stages of the race. Jos Verstappen, running fifth after the retirements of Barrichello and Berger, crashed into the tyre barrier with 12 laps left, guaranteeing Diniz his first Formula One point as by this time only six drivers were left in the race. Damon Hill had started the race from pole position, but dropped to 8th after spinning twice in the opening laps, before another spin into the pit wall on lap 12 ended his race.

The Canadian Grand Prix was won from pole position by Damon Hill, with home driver Jacques Villeneuve second, and Frenchman Jean Alesi third.

The second half of the season began with the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours. Michael Schumacher qualified in pole position but his engine blew on the warm-up lap and he did not start. The race was won by Damon Hill, with Jacques Villeneuve finishing second in the other Williams, and Jean Alesi again third for the Benetton team. This was the last Grand Prix where a Forti car started the race (two weeks later the team would fail to qualify for the British Grand Prix, the final Formula One event they would enter), however both cars were forced to retire.

Jacques Villeneuve took his second win of the season at the British Grand Prix, with Benetton&#x27;s Gerhard Berger second and McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen coming home third for his first podium since his near-fatal crash at the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Jordan&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello took fourth, equalling his best finish of the season. The final points went to David Coulthard in the second McLaren and Martin Brundle in the second Jordan. Hill took pole position for his home race, but made a slow start and retired shortly before half distance, after a wheel nut problem caused him to spin off at Copse Corner while he was trying to pass Häkkinen. For the third consecutive race, Ferrari drivers Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine were both forced to retire with technical issues.

The German Grand Prix at Hockenheim was won by Damon Hill, taking his seventh victory of the season after he started from pole position. Austrian driver Gerhard Berger started alongside Hill on the front row in his Benetton and led for much of the race, until his engine failed with three laps remaining. Berger&#x27;s teammate Jean Alesi was second and Jacques Villeneuve was third. The win meant Hill extended his lead over Villeneuve in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 21 points with five races remaining.

The Hungarian Grand Prix was won by Jacques Villeneuve after starting from third position. Villeneuve&#x27;s teammate Damon Hill finished second, with Jean Alesi third. This was Williams&#x27;s fifth 1–2 finish of the season, and it secured their fourth Constructors&#x27; Championship in five years.

The Belgian Grand Prix saw Michael Schumacher take victory, driving a Ferrari. Schumacher had crashed heavily in Friday practice, but recovered to qualify third before taking his second win of the season. Jacques Villeneuve, who had started from pole position, finished second in his Williams, with Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren. Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Damon Hill, finished fifth.

The Italian Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, giving Ferrari their first victory at Monza since 1988. Jean Alesi finished second in a Benetton, with Mika Häkkinen third. Damon Hill took pole position and led until he made an error and spun off on lap 6, while his teammate and main championship rival, Jacques Villeneuve, could only manage seventh.

The penultimate race of the season was the Portuguese Grand Prix. Williams&#x27;s Jacques Villeneuve won from teammate Damon Hill in second and Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher in third. This victory, Villeneuve&#x27;s fourth of the season, ensured that the Drivers&#x27; Championship battle between him and Hill would go to the final round. Benetton&#x27;s Jean Alesi finished fourth, just behind Schumacher, while Eddie Irvine in the second Ferrari and Gerhard Berger in the second Benetton survived a last-lap collision to take fifth and sixth respectively.

The 1996 season concluded with the title-deciding Japanese Grand Prix on 13 October. Before the event, Hill was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings, with teammate Villeneuve needing to win the race without Hill scoring in order to win the championship himself. In qualifying, Villeneuve took pole position, but made a poor start to the race and later retired when a wheel fell off his car. The race was won by Damon Hill for his eighth victory of the season, securing the Drivers&#x27; Championship in the process. Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari, enabling the Italian team to steal second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship from Benetton, with Mika Häkkinen finishing third in a McLaren. Hill became the first son of a World Champion to win the championship himself, his father Graham having twice been champion, in 1962 and 1968.

<text>The 1995 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 49th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1995 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1995 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a seventeen-race series that commenced on 26 March and ended on 12 November.

Michael Schumacher won his second consecutive Drivers&#x27; Championship, and Benetton won the Constructors&#x27; Championship, the first and only Constructors&#x27; title for the Benetton team. Schumacher won nine races en route to the championship, equalling the record set by Nigel Mansell in . He also continued his rivalry with Williams-Renault driver Damon Hill, including collisions at the British and Italian Grands Prix.

Both those races were won by Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Johnny Herbert, taking his first two F1 victories. Hill&#x27;s Williams teammate, David Coulthard, claimed his first victory in Portugal, while Ferrari&#x27;s Jean Alesi achieved his only F1 victory in Canada. Just like Honda in , Renault engines won all but one race in this season.

1995 was also the last season in which the numbering system introduced in 1974 was used. From 1996 car numbers would generally allocated based on the Constructors&#x27; Championship order of the previous season.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1995 FIA Formula One World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Goodyear.

===Background===
There was a threat of a drivers&#x27; strike over the terms of the 1995 Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) Super Licences, which allowed the FIA to demand promotional appearances and forbade the drivers from criticising the championship. This was resolved by the governing body prior to the race, ensuring full driver participation.

===Team changes===

* At the end of the 1994 season, Team Lotus left F1 after 36 years in the sport, winning 6 Drivers&#x27; and 7 Constructors&#x27; Championships, with the team ceasing operations in January 1995. Shortly before the team closed doors, the team&#x27;s assets were bought by David Hunt, brother of 1976 Formula One champion James Hunt, who later announced that the Lotus name would be used by Pacific Grand Prix under the name Pacific Team Lotus.
* The Larrousse team, with drivers Éric Bernard and Christophe Bouchut, failed to turn up for any of the on-track sessions. With French government aid not forthcoming, the team ran out of money. And with a 1995 chassis not yet built, team owner Gérard Larrousse elected to miss the first two rounds of the season in the hope of competing from the San Marino Grand Prix onwards. No funding ever arrived and it was too late for them to build a car for the season. There were talks with the DAMS Formula 3000 team, but Jean-Paul Driot, boss of DAMS, wanted to buy Larrousse and run the team themselves. After a sponsor deal with Malaysian oil company Petronas also fell through, Driot announced on 13 February that they had abandoned plans to enter F1 for 1995. He intended to return to Formula 3000 and prepare for an F1 bid in .
* Formula 3000 team Forti made the step up to Formula One, with their Forti FG01 being the last F1 car to use a manual gearbox.
* The status and the ownership of Ligier was under scrutiny. When Martin Brundle signed with them for 1995, rumours spread that Tom Walkinshaw would take up the function of team boss, since Brundle and Walkinshaw had many successful collaborations in the past. Walkinshaw worked for Benetton in as Engineering Director), but when that team was found to use an illegal fuel filter at the German Grand Prix, they were let off the hook, after promising to fire Walkinshaw and implementing major changes within the team. On the side of Benetton, this deal was negotiated by Flavio Briatore. However, since he was also the owner of Ligier, it seemed more like a promotion for Walkinshaw, albeit with a smaller team. Furthermore, rivals compared the Ligier JS41 to the Benetton B195, the only apparent difference being the engine in each car. Commenting on the design similarities, Walkinshaw said:
* The 1995 season saw a major reshuffle among the engine suppliers: Benetton ended their 7-year association with Ford Motor Company by switching to the Renault RS7 engines (which were the same used by Renault&#x27;s business partner Williams F1 team). The contract with Ford was taken up by Sauber and they parted ways with long time partner Mercedes-Benz. McLaren then offered a new home for the Mercedes engine supplier, ending their relationship with Peugeot after just one season. Jordan took on the Peugeot engine deal, replacing their Hart contract. And so, finally, the Hart company moved teams to Footwork Arrows. After four years as an independent engine supplier, Ilmor eventually shifted focus to trusted engine designer, builder, assembler and tuner to Mercedes-Benz High Performance Engines despite the partnership started from 1994 season onwards.
* Pacific Racing replaced their 1993-spec Ilmor engines for customer Ford EDC engines.
* Minardi had been expected to run with Mugen-Honda engines, but at the last minute, Ligier boss Flavio Briatore persuaded the Japanese engine supplier to supply his team, leaving Minardi in a mess. Their M195 was designed for the Mugen-Honda V10 and parts were already being made. The team then had to work flat out to build a brand new car with a Ford ED engine, tuned by Magneti Marelli. Team owner Giancarlo Minardi announced he was taking legal action against the Japanese supplier.
* The Simtek team went bankrupt on 1 June, after the fifth race of the season.

===Driver changes===

* On 28 October 1994, Ligier issued a press release stating that Olivier Panis and Johnny Herbert were going to be their official drivers for all of the 1995 season. However, at the end of January, they announced that Herbert was no longer at the team, joining Benetton instead, and that Aguri Suzuki and Martin Brundle would share the second seat. The announcement came as a big shock to Suzuki and his Japanese backers, who believed he had secured the Ligier seat for the whole season. During his &quot;off&quot; races, Brundle joined veteran commentator Murray Walker in the BBC commentary box. They later became commentators for ITV, after Brundle retired from F1 in , and Brundle is now working for Sky Sports F1 alongside David Croft.
* After Ayrton Senna&#x27;s passing, his seat at Williams had alternated between Nigel Mansell and David Coulthard. Mansell left the team at the beginning of January and Coulthard was offered a full-time drive.
* Mika Salo replaced Mark Blundell at Tyrrell, with Gabriele Tarquini now the team&#x27;s test driver. Before being confirmed as race driver, Salo was involved in a contract dispute with the Pacific team. He had raced for Team Lotus in and was thought to be free when the team withdrew, until new owner David Hunt coupled the name with the Pacific team and insisted Salo was obliged to race for them. The Contract Recognition Board lawyers and Tyrrell representatives were astounded by Hunt, but announced on 13 February that it had ruled in favour of Tyrrell, because the Team Lotus which Salo had signed for was not the same Team Lotus which now claimed his services. Salo was unveiled as Tyrrell driver later that evening when they unveiled their 1995 car.
* Mark Blundell replaced fellow countryman Martin Brundle at McLaren. However, Nigel Mansell was in the McLaren seat from the San Marino Grand Prix. He was already confirmed at the team when he left Williams, but he could not fit in the car. His deal was also dropped from $15 million to $10 million because Marlboro refused to pay his asking price. Mansell said that the 1995 season would almost certainly be his last in Formula One.
* Simtek brought in Jos Verstappen from Benetton instead of Hideki Noda, who was scheduled to be the team&#x27;s first driver, but was not able to race, after the Great Hanshin earthquake resulted in a lack of personal funds, and was therefore relegated to share the second drive with Domenico Schiattarella. Noda ended up not driving for the team at all, as they went bankrupt after the Monaco round.
* New team Forti brought in veteran Roberto Moreno along with rookie Pedro Diniz. Diniz was partly selected as his family controls one of Brazil&#x27;s largest food distribution companies.
* Christian Fittipaldi was replaced by Taki Inoue at Footwork.
* Pacific replaced Paul Belmondo with Andrea Montermini.
* Minardi replaced Michele Alboreto with Luca Badoer.

====Mid-season changes====

* Going into the Monaco Grand Prix, McLaren replaced Nigel Mansell with test driver Mark Blundell. At the same time, Karl Wendlinger&#x27;s seat at Sauber was given to Williams test driver and reigning International Formula 3000 champion Jean-Christophe Boullion.
* From the British Grand Prix on, Footwork replaced Gianni Morbidelli with International Formula 3000 driver Massimiliano Papis, citing sponsorship reasons. Morbidelli would eventually return for the final three races of the season. Before that same weekend, Bertrand Gachot stepped away from driving duties with Pacific. The seat was temporarily filled by Giovanni Lavaggi and Jean-Denis Delétraz. The team tried to hire Katsumi Yamamoto and Oliver Gavin, but they were not granted their Super Licences, and Gachot returned for the last three races.
* Minardi replaced Pierluigi Martini with Pedro Lamy from the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards.
* After having done two years of touring car racing, Gabriele Tarquini made a one-off return to F1 when he filled in for Ukyo Katayama at the European Grand Prix, as the Japanese was still recovering from neck injuries and severe bruising sustained during a crash at the previous round in Portugal.
* Jan Magnussen was promoted from test driver at McLaren to replace Mika Häkkinen for the Pacific Grand Prix, due to the Finn suffering from appendicitis.

==Calendar==
===Background===
The calendar was initially announced at the beginning of 1995, but there were doubts over the selected dates:
* The Argentine Grand Prix was the only newly announced race, with it taking place at the Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez circuit. The circuit was due to begin the season on 12 March, but there were doubts over whether the circuit would be ready in time.
* The Second race in Japan was also under threat, as the TI Circuit was badly affected after the Great Hanshin earthquake, which damaged local infrastructure.
* The San Marino round, Spanish round and the Italian round required safety upgrades. The Circuit de Catalunya was also in financial difficulty.

On 6 February, a revised calendar was announced. However, some tracks still needed clearance to race.
* The Argentine Grand Prix moved to 9 April, despite the fact it had now received official clearance from FIA safety inspector Roland Bruynseraede. It gave the honor of being the season opener to Brazil.
* The Pacific round was pushed back due to the earthquake, placing it just one week before the Japanese Grand Prix.
* The European Grand Prix was moved forward seven days, leading to another space in the schedule of just one week.

===Calendar changes===
* The Argentine Grand Prix returned after a 14-year absence. 
* The Spanish Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Monaco round follows the Spanish Grand Prix.
* The European Grand Prix moved from the Circuito Permanente de Jerez to the Nürburgring. It was the first time since that F1 raced there.

==Regulation changes==
===Regulations from 1994===
In the aftermath of the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna, during the weekend of the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, a number of regulation were implemented as of the 1994 German Grand Prix, intended to increase safety of the cars and to limit their performance. These regulations were formalised going into 1995:
* The rear wing could not extend forward of the rear wheel centreline and rear wing elements could only occupy 70% of the space between and above the ground.
* A skid block made of impregnated wood was affixed to the underside of every car and it was demanded to wear was only permitted up to . This was done to force an increase in ride height and thus reduce ground effect advantages.

===New regulations===
More regulation changes followed before the start of the 1995 season:

====Power====
The allowed engine capacity was reduced to 3 litres (down from 3.5 litres) and the description for the type of fuel that was allowed was stringently specified, to reach an approximate 100 BHP reduction in power.

====Aerodynamics====
* The cars&#x27; ride height was raised by .
* The flat-bottomed undertray which was made mandatory in was to now feature a large &quot;stepped&quot; section underneath each sidepod, raised about an inch higher and parallel to the wooden plank originally introduced in 1994.
* The rear wing could not extend more than above the &quot;reference plane&quot; (bottom of the car) - this used to be .
* The front wing had to be at least above the bottom of the car, up from .
* The maximum width of the rear diffuser was brought down from to .
* The exclusion zones above the front and rear wheels, in which no wings or other body parts with aerodynamic influence could be placed, were extended.
All aerodynamic changes summed up were expected by reduce downforce by 30-40%.

====Safety and other====
* Cars had to have impact absorbing side structures, which would have to undergo impact tests.
* Frontal crash tests were now performed at instead of .
* Cockpit openings had to be larger and feature better headrest installations.
* The survival cell had to extend higher alongside the driver.
* The minimum weight of the cars was increased from to to account for the new safety measures, and then increased to to include the driver. Prior to the first session of the season, all of the drivers were weighed to establish a reference weight, to be used on occasions when the two were weighed separately, or if the driver was unavailable to be weighed. As such, a small competitive advantage could be established if the driver attempted to register a weight as heavy as possible before the season and then getting their weight down to lower the total weight of the car on track.

==Season review==

===Pre-season===

The cars were still in various stages of development heading into the new season; the Footwork FA16 and Simtek S951 chassis arrived at the event with virtually no testing, having been completed shortly beforehand.

Luckily for them and other teams that were expected to be fighting over last places, the withdrawal of teams Larrousse and Lotus dropped the number of participating cars to 26, guaranteeing all entrants of a race start, without the threat of failing to qualify, for the first time since the 1994 Canadian Grand Prix.

At the front of the field, Michael Schumacher for Benetton and Damon Hill for Williams were the favourites to battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with Schumacher anticipating a &quot;struggle&quot; for the championship. Bernard Dudot, Renault&#x27;s Chief Engineer, said that he believed Benetton was less well-prepared than Williams, as the former team had just changed its engine supplier to Renault, whereas Williams had been in partnership with the company since .

McLaren were concerned about the standard refuelling equipment provided for 1995 by suppliers Intertechnique, having suffered a major leak in a test of the new rig outside of its factory. Intertechnique had redesigned the fuel equipment, which was used by all of the teams, in the wake of the pit lane fire suffered by driver Jos Verstappen during the previous year&#x27;s German Grand Prix. The new fuel rigs, in addition to being half the size of the 1994, also featured longer nozzles, and were designed to lock onto the car before any fuel could begin to flow. Intertechnique traced the problem to a faulty valve within the equipment, which caused of fuel to leak, and modified the parts accordingly.

===Rounds 1 to 4===
 runner-up Damon Hill for Williams achieved pole position for the first race of the season in Brazil. Champion Michael Schumacher lined up in second in his Benetton. Hill had a bad start and was immediately overtaken by Schumacher. They utilised different pit stop strategies and the battle was heating up until, on lap 31, the Williams driver spun off the track when his gearbox seized. Schumacher comfortably won the race ahead of Hill&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard. Third place was contested by Mika Salo in the Tyrrell until he spun on lap 39, suffering from cramp in his hand, and was overtaken by Mika Häkkinen in the McLaren and the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi. After the second round pit stops, Berger took third place and stayed there.

After the race, Schumacher and Coulthard were both disqualified, as the fuel sample taken from their cars after qualifying did not match the regulations. All classified drivers moved up two places and Berger was declared the victor. However, a successful appeal by the two teams saw their drivers&#x27; results reinstated, since the illegal fuel did not offer a performance advantage. Still, the teams did not receive any points for the Constructors&#x27; Championship and were penalized $200,000. This division between car and driver was met with criticism.&gt;

For the second race in Argentina, Coulthard achieved pole position, the first of his career, with Hill and Schumacher behind him. The start saw collisions between eight drivers and the race was suspended. On lap six of the restarted race, Coulthard&#x27;s throttle failed, allowing Schumacher and Hill past, and leading to the Scot&#x27;s retirement shortly after. During the pit stops, Hill grabbed the lead and Alesi took second place. Schumacher finished third.

Before the race in San Marino, it was Benetton&#x27;s Michael Schumacher on pole position for the first time this season. Berger started second, much to the joy of the local tifosi. Hill started in fourth. Light rain was falling and teams faced a difficult choice in tyres. The first five drivers on the grid started on rain tyres and, after the start, were five seconds per lap quicker than the rest of the field. Rubens Barrichello, the only other driver on wet tyres, started in tenth in his Jordan and quickly got up to sixth. Things turned out in the pit stops: Schumacher crashed, coming out on his cold tyres, and Berger&#x27;s car stalled, giving the lead to Damon Hill. Coulthard and Alesi fought hard over then-second place, but the over-eager Williams driver exceeded the pit lane speed limit and had to undertake a 10-second stop-go penalties. The podium order was Hill, Alesi, Berger.

In Spain, it was Schumacher on pole for the second time and he led from start to finish. On the last lap, Hill was in second, but when he suffered from a hydraulic problem, he crawled across the line in fourth. This allowed Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Johnny Herbert through to second place, his first ever podium. Berger finished third, while Alesi and Coulthard retired.

After four races, Schumacher in the Benetton led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 24 points, just one ahead of Hill in the Williams. Alesi and Berger in the Ferrari followed with 14 and 13 points, respectively. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Ferrari (27) led Williams (26) and Benetton (23).

===Rounds 5 to 10===

On the narrow streets of Monaco, Damon Hill for Williams qualified in pole position. Championship leader Michael Schumacher in the Benetton started next to him. David Coulthard (Williams), Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi (both Ferrari) completed the top five, but the three collided going in the first corner. The track was blocked and the race was suspended. At the second start, the top drivers remained in order, but during the pit stops, Hill fell back behind Schumacher and Alesi. The Ferrari then crashed whilst attempting to avoid Martin Brundle, who had spun. Coulthard retired, so the top three at the finish was Schumacher, Hill, Berger.

This was the last race for the Simtek team, who withdrew from the championship because they ran out of budget.

In Canada, Michael Schumacher achieved pole position, the 100th for a Renault-powered F1 car, and led away comfortably, until on lap 57, an electrical problem forced him into the pits. He was stationary for 70 seconds to change his steering wheel and perform an on-board computer adjustment. He recovered to fifth position at the finish. Jean Alesi went on to win the race on his 31st birthday. This would be his only career victory and also marked the last time to date that a car with a V12 engine won. After several other front-runners encountered problems late in the race, the Jordans of Rubens Barrichello and Eddie Irvine completed the surprising podium.

Just like in Monaco, Hill started on pole position in France, but lost out to second-starting Schumacher during the pit stops. His teammate Coulthard started and finished in third.

During the British Grand Prix, championship rivals Hill and Schumacher clashed for the first time. Hill had started from pole, while Schumacher fell behind third-starting Alesi. As happened regularly this season, Schumacher took the lead by only needing one pit stop, compared to Hill&#x27;s two. But when the Williams tried to repass the Benetton, the two collided and retired. This promoted their teammates Johnny Herbert and David Coulthard to the front. Coulthard took the lead, but incurred a stop-go penalty for speeding in the pit lane. Herbert won the first race of his career, ahead of Jean Alesi in the Ferrari.

Two weeks later, Michael Schumacher won his home race, the German Grand Prix. Damon Hill had achieved pole position once again, but this time, spun off on the second lap as a result of driveshaft failure. David Coulthard finished second, Gerhard Berger was third, recovering from a 10-second stop-go penalty for jumping the start.

The 1995 Hungarian Grand Prix was a grand slam for Damon Hill: he won from pole position and set the fastest lap. Coulthard finished second and Berger third. Michael Schumacher was classified three laps down, suffering from fuel pump issues. During the race, Taki Inoue had his second coming together with the safety car. This time, he himself was hit by the Tatra 623 when running over to his Footwork with a fire extinguisher. He suffered minor injuries to his leg.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Michael Schumacher was leading with 56 points, ahead of Damon Hill with 45 and Jean Alesi with 32. It was closer at the front of the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with Benetton and Williams separated by just six points (74 and 68, respectively), followed by Ferrari with 57.

===Rounds 11 to 14===
Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix took place in varying weather conditions and championship rivals Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill could only achieve sixteenth and eighth place on the grid, respectively. Ferrari&#x27;s Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi blocked out on the front row, but both retired during the race. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Johnny Herbert briefly led the race, but struggled for pace on the drying track. Hill took the lead after his teammate David Coulthard retired with gearbox issues, but then, as it was seen at least three times during the season already, Schumacher passed him during the round of pit stops. The story did not end there, however: the rain arrived and Hill made a second pit stop for rain tyres, while Schumacher tried to brave it out, at one point lapping six seconds slower than his rival. To make matters worse, he went off the track and the Williams took the lead until the rain stopped, the track dried, and the Benetton was back on top. When the safety car came out, the playing field was levelled and Schumacher led away from Hill, both on wet tyres. It looked like a thrilling battle to come, until the Brit was served a 10-second stop-go penalty for speeding in the pit lane. He did recover to second place, but finished far behind the German. Martin Brundle came home in a surprising third position. After the race, Schumacher was given a one-race suspended ban for defending too aggressively.
On the formation lap of the Italian Grand Prix, pole-sitter David Coulthard spun off and retired with terminal damage. However, when the race was suspended after a first-lap collision in the same corner, with the track being blocked by four stranded cars, Coulthard was able to take the restart in a spare car, on pole position. Michael Schumacher and Gerhard Berger started behind him. On lap 13, Coulthard retired again, this time with a wheel bearing failure, and Schumacher crashed out when he was hit in the back by championship rival Damon Hill. After the incident, reminiscent of the one at Silverstone, Schumacher was furious with Hill, but calmed down when learning that the Brit had had to take evasive action when lapping Taki Inoue. The Ferraris were running 1–2 on home soil, until a TV camera on Alesi&#x27;s rear wing fell off and destroyed Berger&#x27;s suspension. With eight laps to go, the Frenchman also retired and handed a second victory to Benetton&#x27;s Johnny Herbert. Mika Häkkinen (McLaren) and Heinz-Harald Frentzen (Sauber) achieved their best results yet in second and third, respectively. After the race, Hill was given a one-race suspended ban for his part in the collision.

In Portugal, Coulthard started on pole position again and this time, he held on to achieve his first career win. Hill started in second, before Schumacher in third, but they finished the other way around. At the start, Ukyo Katayama in the Tyrrell made contact with Luca Badoer&#x27;s Minardi and went airborne. After being extracted from the car, he was hospitalised for two days, suffering from a strained neck and bruising in several places.

The European Grand Prix was held at the Nürburgring and saw Coulthard start on pole, ahead of teammate Damon Hill and championship leader Michael Schumacher. Coulthard did start in the spare car, however, after stalling his engine during his reconnaissance lap. Many teams decided to start on rain tyres, but Ferrari and McLaren switched to dries after the first start was abandoned. This only turned out to be the right decision after seventeen laps, when most other drivers had pitted. Schumacher and Hill battled again, switching positions several times, while Coulthard suffered from excessive oversteer and fell behind them. Meanwhile, Alesi was in the lead and extended his advantage to 45 seconds. During the second round of pit stops, however, he collided with Hill and had to pit for repairs. Berger retired with engine problems and Hill crashed out on lap 58. Schumacher passed Alesi for the lead, two laps from the end, and Coulthard completed the podium.

With three races to go, Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 27 points ahead of Hill. This meant that the Williams driver needed to win all remaining races, with his Benetton rival scoring less than three points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Benetton was leading Williams with 112 over 92 points.

===Rounds 15 to 17===
The F1 circus landed in Japan for two races, the first one dubbed the Pacific Grand Prix. Williams driver David Coulthard achieved his fourth pole position in a row, ahead of teammate Damon Hill and championship leader Michael Schumacher in his Benetton. At the start, fourth-starting Jean Alesi got up to second place. After Schumacher overtook Hill and Alesi during the first round of pit stops, he closed in on the leader and lapped consistently faster, so that the German just came out in front after all pit stops were made. Scoring his eighth victory of the season and gaining enough points to make it impossible for Hill to catch him, the &quot;Schumi&quot; was crowned the 1995 Drivers&#x27; Champion. He was the youngest double Drivers&#x27; Champion up to that point (his record was subsequently surpassed by Sebastian Vettel).

Schumacher did not settle down: he started on pole position for the Japanese Grand Prix. The Williams cars could not match the pace and made room for Jean Alesi and Mika Häkkinen in the top three on the grid. All drivers started on rain tyres, as it had rained in the morning and the track was damp, but it did not stop the champion from leading away. Both Ferraris were judged to have jumped the start and served a 10-second stop-go penalty. But Alesi was the first to switch to dry tyres and began making his way through the field. On lap 25, he was only six seconds behind leader Schumacher, when he had to retire with a driveshaft failure. When the rain arrived, but only on one edge of the circuit, teammates Hill and Coulthard crashed out in the same corner, one lap after each other. Schumacher won and his teammate Johnny Herbert came home in third, earning Benetton the 1995 Constructors&#x27; Champions.

The final race of the season was held in Australia and saw most of the front-running cars retire, except for polesitter Damon Hill. David Coulthard crashed while entering the pit lane, Schumacher and Alesi collided, and Herbert and Berger retired with mechanical issues. Hill won, over two laps ahead of Ligier&#x27;s Olivier Panis and Gianni Morbidelli in a Footwork, equalling Jackie Stewart&#x27;s feat during the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.

<doc id="1137702" wikidata="Q69713" url="?curid=1137702" title="1994 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 48th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1994 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1994 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 27 March and ended on 13 November.

Michael Schumacher won his first Drivers&#x27; Championship driving for Benetton. , this is the last Ford-powered Drivers&#x27; Champion. Williams-Renault won their third consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship, the seventh in all for Williams.

1994 was one of the most tragic and controversial seasons in the sport&#x27;s history. The San Marino Grand Prix saw the deaths of Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger and Brazilian three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna, while a number of other incidents throughout the season resulted in injuries to drivers, mechanics, spectators and a track marshal. The FIA subsequently made sweeping changes to the rules and regulations of F1 in an effort to improve safety. The 1994 season would be the last Formula One season to see a fatality caused by an accident until the 2014 season when Jules Bianchi died as a result of his injuries following an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.

1994 was also marked by a fierce title battle between Schumacher and Damon Hill, who stepped into the lead Williams seat following Senna&#x27;s death. While Schumacher initially dominated, his campaign was marred by a two-race suspension as a result of a disqualification from the British Grand Prix as well as losing a win at the Belgian Grand Prix. This allowed Hill to close the gap significantly in the latter part of the season. The championship concluded in a highly controversial collision between the two rivals at the season-ending Australian Grand Prix, resulting in both drivers retiring and the title being handed to Schumacher, his first of seven world championship titles.

The 1993 champion Alain Prost did not attempt to defend his title, having retired from the sport. 1994 was also the final season for the original Team Lotus, one of the most successful constructors in Formula One history. A total of 46 drivers took part in this season with 14 making their F1 debut including numerous pay drivers, with all except Andrea Montermini making at least one race start. Mercedes-Benz returned to the sport for the first time since , as an engine supplier to Swiss team Sauber. The season also saw the first win for Ferrari since , whilst McLaren, following the departure of Senna, endured their first winless season since .

==Drivers and constructors==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1994 FIA Formula One World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Goodyear.

===Team changes===
* The Lola team (fully known as &quot;Lola BMS Scuderia Italia&quot;) had folded two races before the end of the 1993 season. Part of the assets were taken over by the Minardi team, leaving the name &quot;Lola&quot; behind and forming &quot;Minardi Scuderia Italia&quot;.
* Following a year with customer Ford V8 power and a brief flirtation testing the Lamborghini V12 engine, McLaren settled on works Peugeot V10 engines for 1994.
* Lotus obtained an engine deal with Mugen-Honda, making it their first time running Honda power since .
* Footwork, running with Mugen Honda engines in took over the Ford contract.
* Fulfulling their role of Sauber&#x27;s technical partner, Mercedes-Benz further developed the 1993 Ilmor V10 and officially entered F1 for the first time since .
* Larrousse had collaborated with Lamborghini in 1993, but joined Footwork in using Ford engines. Lamborghini left the sport when the deal with McLaren fell through.
* Two new teams were welcomed onto the grid: Simtek and Pacific Racing.

===Driver changes===
* After winning his fourth and final Drivers&#x27; Championship in , Alain Prost decided not to defend his title in 1994 despite testing for McLaren before the season began. Williams attracted three-time champion Ayrton Senna. Senna&#x27;s seat at McLaren was given to Martin Brundle.
* Sauber replaced JJ Lehto with debutant Heinz-Harald Frentzen, the Finn finding a new home at Benetton, from where Riccardo Patrese had retired. However, he injured his neck in pre-season testing and Jos Verstappen, father of future four-time champion Max Verstappen, stepped up. Lehto ended up competing in just six races.
* Mark Blundell was hired by Tyrrell. Ex-driver Andrea de Cesaris acted as reserve driver at Jordan and Sauber in 1994.
* With Ligier losing both 1993 drivers to other teams, they started 1994 with Éric Bernard, returning to F1 after two years, and 1993 F3000 champion Olivier Panis.
* Minardi hired Michele Alboreto, after he had competed for the Benetton seat, instead of Jean-Marc Gounon, the Frenchman moving to Simtek on a part-time contract.
* Derek Warwick and Aguri Suzuki were let go by Footwork in favour of Christian Fittipaldi, 1993 Minardi driver, and Gianni Morbidelli, Minardi driver.
* Larrousse replaced Toshio Suzuki with Olivier Beretta, coming out of Formula 3000.
* Simtek entered the season with David Brabham, last seen in F1 in , and F3000 driver Roland Ratzenberger, while Pacific hired Paul Belmondo, returning after his drive for March in , and Bertrand Gachot, for his fifth season in F1.

====Mid-season changes====

* Ayrton Senna fatally crashed during the San Marino Grand Prix, the third race of the season. Williams entered the next race with one car, before test driver David Coulthard made his debut in Spain. He shared his position with champion Nigel Mansell.
* Benetton test driver Jos Verstappen took the racing seat when driver JJ Lehto injured his neck during pre-season testing. After sitting out two races, Lehto was deemed fit enough to return. However, his performances disappointed, and the Dutchman was called back. He competed in eight races, until he was replaced with Lotus driver Johnny Herbert for the remaining two Grands Prix (see below). Lehto did enter two more races with the team, when Michael Schumacher was disqualified from the British Grand Prix and handed a two-race ban, and finished the season at Sauber.
* Ferrari driver Jean Alesi injured his back during private testing at Mugello Circuit and was replaced by test driver Nicola Larini.
* Jordan driver Eddie Irvine was involved in a four-car crash, for which he received a one-race ban. He was replaced by ex-Footwork driver Aguri Suzuki. Irvine appealed to the FIA against the decision, but his plea was rejected and the penalty was increased to a three-race ban. His seat was filled by Aguri Suzuki for the following Pacific Grand Prix, and Andrea de Cesaris for the races in San Marino and Monaco. Andrea de Cesaris stepped in, having previously raced for the team in .
* Sauber driver Karl Wendlinger crashed during the first practice session of the Monaco Grand Prix and remained in a coma for several weeks. He did not return for the rest of the season. His seat was filled by De Cesaris, after driving for Jordan, and JJ Letho, released from his contract at Benetton.
* Lotus driver Pedro Lamy suffered a heavy crash in a private test session at Silverstone, breaking both legs and wrists. He was replaced with test driver Alessandro Zanardi. Pay driver Philippe Adams also drove two races. With three races to go in the season, their other driver, Johnny Herbert, and Ligier driver Éric Bernard switched teams. However, Bernard was let go after one race in favour of Mika Salo, who had actually never before driven an F1 car. After one race with Ligier, Herbert was hired by Benetton (the two teams had close ties in that time), in anticipation of a full-time drive in .
* After employing Éric Bernard and Johnny Herbert, Ligier let test driver Franck Lagorce compete in the final two races of the season.
* Larrousse driver Philippe Alliot was test driver for McLaren in 1994 and filled in for Mika Häkkinen who had received a one-race ban for causing the crash on the first lap of the German Grand Prix. Alliot was loaned to his former employer for one race when Olivier Beretta&#x27;s sponsorship money ran out and he left the team.
* After temporarily needing Alliot&#x27;s services, Larrousse hired Yannick Dalmas, returning to F1 since , and F3000 driver Hideki Noda. Pay driver Jean-Denis Delétraz bought one race entry instead of the other Larrousse driver Érik Comas.
* Andrea Montermini debuted for Simtek after the death of Roland Ratzenberger. However, he crashed in his first practice session and broke his left heel and right foot. The seat was filled by ex-Minardi driver Jean-Marc Gounon, pay driver Domenico Schiattarella and F3000 driver Taki Inoue.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
The South African Grand Prix was dropped months after the Kyalami circuit was sold to the South African Automobile Association in July 1993 which found running a Formula One event proved too costly.

The European Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 17 April at Donington Park was cancelled and replaced by the Pacific Grand Prix which hosted its first Grand Prix in 1994. The race was held at the TI Circuit in Japan.

The Spanish Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Spanish round follows the Monaco Grand Prix.

The Argentine Grand Prix had been originally scheduled for 16 October, but was cancelled on 1 June as the Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez track, which was being modernized since 1991, was still undergoing work and the owners were not finished with the project.

The European Grand Prix reappeared on the calendar as a replacement for the cancelled Argentine Grand Prix with the race being held on 16 October, the race was held at Circuito Permanente de Jerez. It was the first time since 1990 that a F1 race was held at Jerez.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
====Pre-season changes====
In order to combat the spiraling costs of running a Formula One team, and to counteract criticism that over-reliance on technology was reducing the drivers to a secondary role, sweeping rule changes were introduced for 1994, most notably a ban on all electronic &quot;driver aids&quot;, such as:
* Active suspension
* Anti-lock brakes
* Traction control
* Launch control

Four-wheel steering was also banned. Ayrton Senna was among several observers who said that, with such features removed but no attempt to curtail the speed of the cars, 1994 would be &quot;a season with a lot of accidents&quot;; ironically, Senna had been a proponent of the ban on electronic driver aids.

1994 also saw the reintroduction of refuelling during the race for the first time since .

Finally, each gearbox should have four to seven gear ratios.

====Mid-season changes====
After the fatal crashes at Imola, several rule changes were introduced to slow the cars down:
* In Spain, front wing endplates and rear diffusers were reduced in size.
* For the following race in Canada, the effectiveness of the airbox was reduced by means of holes cut into the engine cover, resulting in less power.
* From Germany onwards, a skid block made of impregnated wood was affixed to the underside of every car and it was demanded to wear was only permitted up to . This was done to force an increase in ride height and thus reduce ground effect advantages. From this race on, as well, the rear wing could not extend forward of the rear wheel centreline and rear wing elements could only occupy 70% of the space between and above the ground. Finally, the placement of the front wing was now set to at least above the &quot;reference plane&quot; (the flat bottom of the car), up from .

Furthermore, extra safety checks were implemented:
* More stringent fire extinguisher regulations
* Minimum thickness of the headrest was set at 
* The minimum load that the monocoque had to be able to withstand was raised from 20 kN to 30 kN.

===Sporting and event regulations===
* The pit lane speed limit was raised to in practice and in the race.

====Mid-season changes====
* After the fatal crashes at Imola, 27 corners on tracks where F1 would race later in the year were identified as bringing a &quot;very high risk&quot; of accidents. 15 of them, including the famous Eau Rouge were bypassed or slowed down (usually with the use of temporary chicanes made of tyre walls or cones).
* After the fire in the Benetton pit box during the German Grand Prix, a fire shield was made obligatory on all circuits, to act as a shield for spectators watching from the upper floors of pit buildings.

==Race-by-race==

===Race 1: Brazil===
The season started off in Brazil and all the native fans were supporting Senna. It was no surprise that Senna took pole ahead of Schumacher, Alesi, Hill, Frentzen and Gianni Morbidelli. At the start, Alesi took second from Schumacher while Wendlinger and Verstappen, who was driving in place of Lehto who had suffered a neck injury in testing, got ahead of Frentzen and Morbidelli. At the end of lap 1 Senna was leading Alesi, Schumacher, Hill, Wendlinger and Verstappen.

On lap 2, Schumacher took second from Alesi after a couple of unsuccessful earlier attempts. The Frenchman had been holding Schumacher up while Senna pulled out a 4-second lead. Senna and Schumacher pulled away from the rest of the pack, increasing their lead by over a second a lap. Both pitted on lap 21 but Schumacher was quicker and rejoined ahead. He pulled away to take a 10-second lead but then Senna began to reel him in. By lap 35, Verstappen, Brundle and Eddie Irvine had all got ahead of Wendlinger. As they came up to lap Éric Bernard, Verstappen tried to pass Irvine. Irvine pushed him onto the grass and Verstappen spun off, going over Irvine and tipping it into Bernard&#x27;s car and then hitting Brundle, being launched into a series of barrel rolls. No-one was hurt, but Irvine was banned initially for one race, later extended to three races by the FIA after an unsuccessful appeal. By now, Alesi, who had stopped twice, was behind Hill who had only stopped once.

There was more action as both Ukyo Katayama and then Rubens Barrichello passed Wendlinger to get into the points. Both then stopped, with Barrichello getting ahead. Senna had reduced the gap to Schumacher to 5 seconds, but then spun off on lap 56, just pushing too hard. He was out. Schumacher won ahead of Hill, Alesi, Barrichello, Katayama and Wendlinger.

===Race 2: Pacific (Japan)===
Ferrari&#x27;s Jean Alesi had injured his back in a testing crash at Mugello and was replaced by Nicola Larini who immediately caused controversy when he told the Italian media that he had used the now-banned traction control in practice, though both the team and driver later denied this. Meanwhile, Aguri Suzuki would replace Eddie Irvine for the Jordan team. Round 2 was at the new Tanaka International circuit in Japan and Senna took pole ahead of Schumacher, Hill, Häkkinen, Berger, and Brundle. At the start, Schumacher got ahead of Senna and Häkkinen got past Hill. Häkkinen tried to attack Senna but ran into the back of him. Senna spun and was hit by Larini, taking both out. Schumacher finished the lap leading Häkkinen, Hill, Berger, Barrichello, and Brundle.

Hill was frustrated at seeing Schumacher pull away and attacked Häkkinen on lap 4. Hill messed up, spun, and dropped back to ninth. He charged back up, passing Brundle on lap 12. It was time for the pit stops during which Hill got ahead of Barrichello. Häkkinen retired when his gearbox failed on lap 19.

While Schumacher pulled away, Hill closed in on Berger. During the second round of pit stops, Hill got by Berger and Brundle got by Barrichello. However, Hill retired on lap 50 when his transmission failed and Brundle also went out on lap 68 when his engine overheated. Schumacher made it two wins out of two ahead of Berger, Barrichello, Christian Fittipaldi, Frentzen, and Érik Comas.

===Race 3: San Marino===
Lehto was back for the San Marino Grand Prix and Andrea de Cesaris would be the second driver at Jordan. However, the weekend got off to a bad start as Rubens Barrichello had a major crash during practice and was knocked unconscious. Coming too fast into Variante Bassa, his car was launched into the air by the kerb. Less than a yard from that kerb was a tyre wall, which almost instantly stopped the car&#x27;s forward motion. His car was flipped over and landed upside down. Barrichello had swallowed his tongue and his life was only saved by quick action from the medical team. He would be back at the circuit on the Saturday afternoon with a broken nose, bandaged arm and cut lip. Barrichello has never been able to recall anything from the incident.

In qualifying, a front wing flap fell off Roland Ratzenberger&#x27;s car, causing major suspension damage and worsened aerodynamics. On his next lap the front wing broke off entirely and became lodged underneath the car, causing Ratzenberger to lose control and crash into the wall at the &quot;Villeneuve&quot; kink at over 180 mph. His Simtek S941 was severely damaged, and he suffered a basal skull fracture caused by the impact and was pronounced dead at Bologna&#x27;s Maggiore Hospital shortly afterwards.

After qualifying re-commenced, Senna took pole ahead of Schumacher, Berger, Hill, Lehto and Larini. During the race morning&#x27;s driver meeting, all the drivers were talking about Ratzenberger&#x27;s crash and were determined to improve safety for drivers, resulting in the inauguration of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA). Senna offered to take the role of leader as he was the most senior driver.

At the start of the race, Lehto&#x27;s Benetton B194 stalled and was hit by Pedro Lamy&#x27;s Lotus. Debris from the crash, including Lamy&#x27;s right front tyre, flew into the grandstand and injured four spectators and a policeman. Lamy was unhurt but Lehto received a light arm injury. The safety car—a sports variant of an Opel Vectra whose pace would later be criticized as being inadequate to help maintain the competitors&#x27; tyres up to temperature—was called out with Senna leading Schumacher, Berger, Hill, Frentzen and Häkkinen.

The race restarted at the end of lap 5. Senna tried immediately to pull away from Schumacher, whilst Berger in 3rd was already 2.586 seconds behind and Hill in 4th was 5.535 seconds behind. At the start of the 7th lap, Senna lost control, for reasons that are still the subject of controversy, and his car went straight on at Tamburello into an unprotected concrete wall. Telemetry shows he left the track at 310 km/h (190 mph) and was able to slow the car down by braking to 218 km/h (135 mph) in slightly under 2 seconds before hitting the wall. The suspension of the Williams broke on impact, the right front tyre flying backwards and hitting Senna on the head. The car slid to a halt on the circuit, with Senna motionless. From the helicopter pictures, a slight movement of Senna&#x27;s head gave a hint of hope. Doctor Sid Watkins was on the scene in less than two minutes. Senna was airlifted to hospital but nothing could be done and Senna was pronounced dead later that evening. After the race, a moving detail was revealed when an Austrian flag was found in the Brazilian&#x27;s cockpit because it is thought Senna had planned to pay tribute to Ratzenberger after the race. The race was immediately stopped after Senna&#x27;s crash.

During the red flag period, the Larrousse team mistakenly released their driver Erik Comas from the pit lane, and Comas was marshalled to a stop at Tamburello corner. Commentating for Eurosport, former F1 driver John Watson described the Comas incident as the &quot;most ridiculous incident I have seen at any time in my life, that a Grand Prix driver is allowed to exit the pits whilst the race is stopped&quot;. At the second restart, German Heinz-Harald Frentzen stopped in the Sauber and had to start from the pit lane.

When it restarted, Berger took the lead on track but Schumacher (who collided with Damon Hill, forcing the Briton in the Williams to stop for a new front wing) was still leading in the aggregate standings, with Berger, Häkkinen, Larini, Wendlinger and Katayama following. On the 12th Lap in total, Schumacher did take the lead on the circuit from Berger, but pitted immediately afterwards. When Berger stopped on lap 15, Häkkinen took the lead for McLaren. Berger retired on lap 17 with a suspension failure, whilst Häkkinen pitted a bit later, rejoining fourth. On Lap 21, Schumacher led (although driving behind Larini) on aggregate ahead of the Italian with Fittipaldi (who pitted on lap 23) in third, Häkkinen, Frentzen (who pitted a bit shorter as well) and Wendlinger making up the top six. From about lap 45 until lap 55, Damon Hill, Ukyo Katayama and Christian Fittipaldi battled for 5th, 6th and 7th, with first Fittipaldi and then Hill passing the Japanese in the Tyrrell on aggregate, Hill himself passed Fittipaldi on lap 49, only to lose the position two laps later. Fittipaldi did not finish the race; he retired with brake problems on lap 55. Damon Hill gained fifth, but lost it again to Katayama with two laps to go, and only kept a one-second lead over Heinz-Harald Frentzen to score the last point in the San Marino Grand Prix.

Another incident followed when Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Minardi lost its right rear wheel while exiting the pits. Alboreto had already accelerated to a significant speed, and thus the wheel caused severe injuries to a member of the Ferrari pit crew. Alboreto&#x27;s car came to a halt just outside the pits. The incident would lead to two major rule changes in Formula One:
* A pit lane speed limit of 120 km/h during the race and 80 km/h during practice and qualifying.
* Pit crews would now have to remain inside their garage until needed.
Both rules would already be imposed at the next race in Monaco and an 80 km/h speed limit is still in effect as of the season.

Schumacher won ahead of Larini, Häkkinen, Wendlinger, Katayama and Hill but there were no celebrations on the podium and all the talk after the race centred on Senna and Ratzenberger.

===Race 4: Monaco===
Alesi returned as the mourning F1 field moved to Monaco where there would be more bad news as Wendlinger crashed heavily into the Nouvelle Chicane wall at high speed during the first free practice session. Quick action from the marshals saved his life but he was in a coma for three weeks, and recuperation from his head injuries ruled him out for the remainder of the season. Frentzen&#x27;s Sauber was withdrawn for the Monaco event in response as a mark of respect. Schumacher took his first ever pole ahead of Häkkinen, Berger, Hill, Alesi and Fittipaldi.

On Friday morning, Niki Lauda announced the reformation of Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA). The representatives elected were Niki Lauda, Michael Schumacher, Gerhard Berger and Christian Fittipaldi. Following the tragic accidents during the season the GPDA demanded the FIA improve the safety of Formula 1. The FIA responded quickly and introduced changes to the regulations as follows:

For next race, the Spanish Grand Prix,
* the size of diffusers would be reduced,
* the front wing end plates would be raised,
* the size of the front wing would be reduced.
Combined this would reduce the amount of downforce by about 15%.

For the race after that, the Canadian Grand Prix,
* the lateral protection of the drivers&#x27; heads would be improved by increasing the height of the sides of the cockpit,
* the minimum weight of a Formula 1 car would be increased by 25 kg (changed to 15 kg by Canadian GP),
* the front wishbones would be strengthened to reduce the possibility of a front wheel coming loose and striking the driver,
* the cockpit would be lengthened to prevent drivers striking their head on the front of the cockpit,
* the use of pump petrol would be introduced in a change to the fuel regulations,
* the airboxes from the engines would be removed to reduce the airflow to the engines and thus decrease the power available.

At the start, with the first two grid positions left empty and painted with the Brazilian and Austrian flags, out of respect for Senna and Ratzenberger (Williams and Simtek not fielding their second cars for the race), Hill got ahead of Berger and attacked Häkkinen into the first corner. There was contact and both spun off into the escape road and were out. Schumacher was leading ahead of Berger, Alesi, Fittipaldi, Brundle and Katayama. Schumacher pulled away while Brundle used a good strategy during the stops, pitting earlier than the others to get ahead of Fittipaldi and Alesi.

Katayama went out on lap 39 with gearbox failure and sixth place went to his teammate Mark Blundell. However, Blundell&#x27;s engine failed two laps later, spreading oil across the track. Schumacher slid and nearly hit a wall while Berger went down an escape road and dropped behind Brundle. Fittipaldi retired on lap 48 with a gearbox failure. During the second stops, Andrea de Cesaris was able to get ahead of an exhausted Alesi who was struggling with neck pain. Schumacher won ahead of Brundle, Berger, de Cesaris, Alesi and Michele Alboreto.

Between the Monaco GP and the Spanish GP, Williams announced they had brought David Coulthard in to replace Senna, with Nigel Mansell deputising at those races which did not overlap with his IndyCar commitments. Alessandro Zanardi was also in at Lotus alongside Johnny Herbert as Pedro Lamy had suffered a massive testing accident at Silverstone which resulted in him sustaining two dislocated legs and a broken wrist. He would be out for the majority of the season.

===Race 5: Spain===
Eddie Irvine returned to Jordan after serving his 3 race ban. Sauber fielded only one car for Frentzen. A temporary tyre chicane was installed at the &quot;Nissan&quot; corner to reduce speeds before the &quot;La Caixa&quot; hairpin.

In Saturday morning&#x27;s free practice session Andrea Montermini, who had replaced Ratzenberger in the Simtek, had a huge crash exiting the high-speed final corner. In light of recent events, the paddock breathed a sigh of relief when it was announced Montermini had escaped with only a broken ankle and chipped heel. Schumacher took pole ahead of Hill, Häkkinen, Lehto, Barrichello and Alesi. As Simtek and Sauber both fielded only 1 car for the race (Sauber out of respect for Wendlinger and Simtek because of Montermini&#x27;s crash), both Pacific cars were able to qualify for the race by default as they did in Monaco.

Beretta&#x27;s engine failed on the formation lap meaning the Larousse driver failed to start. Meanwhile, at the start, Alesi got ahead of both Barrichello and Lehto with Coulthard getting ahead of Barrichello as well. Schumacher led Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, Lehto and Coulthard into lap 2. Schumacher pulled away until he began to have gear selection problems and was stuck in fifth gear. During the stops, Schumacher amazingly was able to pull away without stalling. Behind, there was action in the pits as Coulthard stalled and Alesi had troubles, dropping down four places. Schumacher, still in the lead, was struggling and was passed by Hill. During the second round of pit stops, Barrichello spun off near the pit entry and Schumacher was once again able to make a pitstop and not stall the car. Häkkinen was right with him but did not have a chance to attack as his engine failed on lap 49. Lehto took up third, but his engine failed as well five laps later. Brundle took the place, but his transmission failed with six laps to go. Hill won from Schumacher who was a superb second in the circumstances, Blundell, Alesi, Pierluigi Martini and Irvine.

===Race 6: Canada===
The new regulations introduced during the Monaco weekend to modify amongst other things the airboxes of the cars were now in effect and were visibly shown as teams had to cut holes in the engine covers. Another temporary chicane was installed prior to the flat-out left-right kink leading to the start-finish straight to slow the cars down. Benetton introduced a revised rear wing assembly and Ferrari had new side pods for their cars. Andrea de Cesaris was back in action, now with Sauber, and celebrated his 200th Grand Prix start.

Qualifying in Canada saw Schumacher on pole ahead of Alesi, Berger, Hill, Coulthard and Barrichello. At the start, Coulthard surprised Hill and Häkkinen got ahead of Barrichello. Schumacher led from Alesi, Berger, Coulthard, Hill and Häkkinen. Hill passed Coulthard on lap 4 but Coulthard retook the place on the outside. Coulthard waved Hill through on lap 9. Hill now set off after Berger, passing him on lap 15.

During the stops, Hill got by Alesi with Häkkinen getting ahead of Coulthard. Häkkinen closed up on Berger but was unable to pass. Although it began to rain on lap 40, still there were no major changes at the top, with the top 6 remaining unaltered. On lap 62, Häkkinen&#x27;s engine blew up, putting him out. On the last lap, Barrichello and Blundell were fighting for sixth when they collided, with Blundell beached in the gravel trap and Barrichello dropping behind Fittipaldi and Lehto. Fittipaldi was, however, disqualified for an underweight car, giving sixth to Lehto. Schumacher won ahead of Hill, Alesi, Berger, Coulthard and Lehto.

The Canadian GP was the last time in 1994 that the Pacific team qualified for a race. Bertrand Gachot retired after 47 laps with oil pressure problems. For the rest of the season the woefully slow cars would fail to even make the grid.

===Race 7: France===
France was the venue for the next Grand Prix and Mansell was going to race for Williams as it would not interfere with his CART racing. Benetton had relegated Lehto to the third driver and given the second seat behind Schumacher to Verstappen. Frenchman Jean-Marc Gounon took the second Simtek seat alongside David Brabham. The Williams team took a 1–2 in qualifying with Hill on pole ahead of Mansell, Schumacher, Alesi, Berger and Irvine. At the start, Schumacher showed class to slice between both Williams to take the lead while Barrichello got ahead of Irvine. Schumacher led ahead of Hill, Mansell, Alesi, Berger and Barrichello.

Schumacher pulled away as usual with Hill unable to keep up. During the stops, Alesi got ahead of Mansell and Berger got by Barrichello. Berger then passed Mansell on lap 24. The order settled down at Schumacher, Hill, Alesi, Berger, Mansell and Barrichello. Alesi soon pitted, dropping to fifth. He then spun on lap 42, and was hit by Barrichello as he tried to rejoin, taking both out.

Mansell was planning only to stop twice and took third when Berger pitted but retired on lap 46 when his transmission failed. Häkkinen, now fourth, retired two laps later with a blown engine. There were no changes in the third round of stops although Katayama spun off from fifth soon after, on lap 54. Schumacher won once again from Hill, Berger, Frentzen, Martini and de Cesaris.

===Race 8: Great Britain===
Hill took pole position in front of his home crowd in Britain ahead of Schumacher, Berger, Alesi, Häkkinen and Barrichello. There was controversy as Schumacher passed Hill on the parade lap, not permitted under the regulations, and then let him resume first position before they came back to the grid to form up. The first start was aborted when Coulthard (returning to the Williams team) stalled on the grid and was forced to start from the back. Irvine retired on the second parade lap with engine problems and at the second start, Brundle&#x27;s engine blew in a ball of fire. At the start, Barrichello was the man on the move, getting by Alesi and Häkkinen. Hill led Schumacher, Berger, Barrichello, Alesi and Häkkinen.

Hill and Schumacher stayed together, separated by two seconds until lap 14, when Schumacher was given a five-second stop-go penalty for passing Hill on the parade lap. The team told him to ignore this as they were appealing the decision. Schumacher stayed out beyond the three laps required to adhere to the penalty, and was then shown the black flag meaning he was excluded from the race and from that point would have to return to the pits and retire. Benetton, however, continued to negotiate and appeal the decision with race officials. Schumacher did return to the pits on lap 26, but only for the five-second stop-go penalty. He re-joined the race in third behind Berger and Hill.

On lap 33, Berger went out with an engine failure. Hill won with Schumacher second, but Schumacher was disqualified for ignoring the black flag and was banned for two races. This meant that Hill kept his win ahead of Alesi, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Coulthard, and Katayama. Häkkinen and Barrichello received a 1 race suspended ban for a collision between the two on the final lap of the race.

Thus, at the halfway stage of the championship, Schumacher was well ahead of the field with 66 points. Hill was a distant second with 39, Alesi third with 19, Berger fourth with 17, Barrichello fifth with 10, Häkkinen sixth with 8, Brundle seventh with 6 and Larini eighth with 6. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Benetton were comfortably ahead with 67 points, 24 points ahead of Williams with 43. Ferrari were also right there, just a single point behind with 42, with McLaren fourth with 14.

Benetton had appealed against Schumacher&#x27;s ban and he was able to race while the decision was pending.

===Race 9: Germany===
The second half of the season started in Germany but the Schumacher fans went home disappointed as the Ferraris locked out the front row in qualifying. Berger took pole ahead of Alesi, Hill, Schumacher down in fourth, Katayama and Coulthard. At the start Katayama got ahead of Hill and Schumacher and then Schumacher got by Hill. There was mayhem behind as Häkkinen hit Brundle and spun off, taking out Frentzen, Barrichello and Irvine, as well as knocking Coulthard&#x27;s front wing out of place. Brundle braked to avoid the mess but was hit by Herbert, taking Herbert out. Behind, there was a collision between Martini and Alessandro Zanardi, taking out de Cesaris and Alboreto in the process. A total of 10 cars were out by the first corner. Surprisingly, the race was not red-flagged.

On the run down to the first chicane Alesi slowed with an electrical problem and retired in the pits, but also blocked Katayama, allowing both Schumacher and Hill to attack. Schumacher went through but Hill hit Katayama, damaging his front suspension. Coulthard pitted for a new wing and Hill double-stacked behind him to get his suspension checked. Brundle, Coulthard and Hill rejoined after repairs as Berger was leading from Schumacher, Katayama, Olivier Panis, Bernard and Fittipaldi. Katayama retired on lap 7 with throttle troubles as Verstappen passed Fittipaldi. It was time for the stops and Verstappen retired following a fire as fuel spilled onto the bodywork of the car. He managed to escape relatively uninjured but the car was reduced to a smoldering wreck. The incident served to highlight the dangers of refuelling now it had been re-introduced to the sport, and paved the way for future safety measures. Schumacher retired on lap 20 with an engine failure.

With most of the major players out or far down the order after incidents, Berger took an emotional win which he dedicated to his friend Senna. A race of attrition saw some unfamiliar faces in the top six. Both Ligiers of Panis and Bernard finished on the podium, Fittipaldi and Morbidelli collected valuable points for Footwork and Comas picked up the final point for Larrousse.

===Race 10: Hungary===
The news before Hungary was that Häkkinen had been banned for one race for causing the pile-up in Germany and was replaced by Philippe Alliot. Schumacher was on pole ahead of Hill, Coulthard, Berger, Katayama and Brundle. At the start Irvine and Barrichello were quick and got ahead of Brundle and Katayama.

However, they collided into the second corner and took off Katayama as well. Schumacher led Hill, Coulthard, Berger, Brundle and Panis. Early on, Alesi passed Panis for sixth. Nothing changed as the order settled down, with the first round of stops leaving the same order. Finally, there was action behind as Berger stalled during the second round of pit stops and dropped behind Brundle, Alesi and Verstappen.

Both Ferrari engines then failed; Alesi&#x27;s on lap 59 and Berger&#x27;s on lap 73. Alesi&#x27;s engine left oil on the track, and Coulthard spun on it into the wall. On the last lap, Brundle stopped with an electrical failure. Schumacher won from Hill, Verstappen, Brundle, Blundell and Panis.

Controversy surrounded Benetton following the Verstappen pit-fire at Hockenheim. The team was summoned to appear before the World Motorsport council on 19 October 1994, to explain why a filter had been removed from the refuelling rig. If found guilty, the team would be excluded from the championship, but they were acquitted. McLaren were also in the dock over the use of a fully automatic upchange device. They were also acquitted.

===Race 11: Belgium===
The most notable aspect of this race was the alteration of the Eau Rouge corner into a slow chicane, due to safety fears after the Senna/Ratzenberger accidents. This was achieved simply by painting new boundary lines onto the track, with the original layout restored for 1995.

Häkkinen was back in Belgium after the ban, Philippe Adams replaced Zanardi at Lotus and Philippe Alliot moved from McLaren duties to replace Beretta at Larrousse. Rain in qualifying resulting in a scrambled grid order with Barrichello on pole from Schumacher, Hill, Irvine, Alesi and Verstappen. At the start Alesi was on the move, quickly getting ahead of Irvine and Hill. Schumacher took the lead on the run up the hill with Alesi following him to second soon after and Verstappen then passing Irvine. Schumacher led Alesi, Barrichello, Hill, Verstappen and Irvine.

Hill passed Barrichello for third and this became second when Alesi&#x27;s engine failed on the next lap. Soon Häkkinen passed Irvine but Coulthard dropped back while trying to follow him through. Barrichello was passed by Verstappen and then Häkkinen attacked him. Barrichello cracked under the pressure and spun off on lap 20 into the wall, ending his race. On the next lap, Schumacher had a 360 degree spin at Pouhon, and his lead was significantly reduced when he rejoined. He kept a five-second lead during the stops in which Häkkinen got ahead of Verstappen.

On lap 35, Coulthard passed Irvine, who then retired on lap 41 with three laps to go, with an alternator failure. Schumacher took the chequered flag, but was disqualified after the race because the wooden stepped flat bottom board on Schumacher&#x27;s car had been excessively worn away, more than the permitted 10% wear. Hill was reclassified as the winner ahead of Häkkinen, Verstappen, Coulthard, Blundell and Morbidelli.

Schumacher&#x27;s ban (handed down after the British Grand Prix) stood after appeal and he would miss Italy and Portugal. He was replaced by Lehto.

===Race 12: Italy===
Driver swapping continued as Zanardi got his seat back from Adams for Monza and Yannick Dalmas was back after almost 4 years absence, now partnering Comas at Larrousse. In Italy, the Ferrari fans were sent wild as their drivers took another 1–2 in qualifying, Alesi on pole ahead of Berger and Hill. Johnny Herbert qualified an unexpected fourth in the new Lotus 109 and was followed by Coulthard and Panis. At the start, Herbert and Irvine got ahead of the Williams but Irvine hit Herbert and Herbert spun, causing mayhem behind and a red flag. The second start was uneventful with Coulthard getting ahead of Herbert and Häkkinen getting ahead of Panis. Alesi led Berger, Hill, Coulthard, Herbert and Häkkinen.

While the Ferraris pulled away (Alesi pulling away from Berger), Häkkinen passed Herbert (in the spare Lotus, an older car) who retired on lap 13 when his alternator failed. Alesi then pitted but his car refused to engage a gear when he tried to rejoin resulting in his retirement. During Berger&#x27;s stop, he was blocked by another car which was going into the pit. In his frustration, he accidentally stalled the car exiting his stop and lost over 10 seconds, dropping back to third. Coulthard also got ahead of Hill during the stops, however Hill passed Coulthard on lap 29 to take the lead.

Berger was closing in on them both, however the Williamses held him off and looked set to finish 1–2 until Coulthard slowed dramatically, as he ran out of fuel on the last lap. Hill won from Berger, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Brundle and Coulthard, who was classified sixth.

Eddie Irvine was given a one-race ban, suspended for three races, for his behaviour in the first corner incident at the first start.

With three-quarters of the season gone, Schumacher who had served one race of his two-race ban led the championship with 76 points, but Hill, second with 65 points was just 11 points behind. Berger was third with 33, Alesi fourth with 19, Häkkinen fifth with 18, Barrichello sixth with 13, Brundle seventh with 11 and Verstappen eighth with 8. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Benetton led with 85 points but Williams were hot on their heels with 73. Ferrari were not too far behind with 58, and McLaren fourth with 29.

===Race 13: Portugal===
Schumacher was still banned as the field went to Portugal. Philippe Adams had another go in the financially struggling Lotus. In qualifying, Berger took pole ahead of Hill, Coulthard, Häkkinen, Alesi and Katayama. At the start, Coulthard got ahead of Hill and Alesi was ahead of Häkkinen. Berger was leading Coulthard, Hill, Alesi, Häkkinen, and Katayama. Berger only lasted until lap 8 when his gearbox failed, promoting Barrichello to the points. Just before the stops, Katayama&#x27;s gearbox also failed, on lap 27.

The stops did not change the order, with Coulthard leading ahead of Hill, Alesi, Häkkinen, Barrichello and Brundle. Coulthard went wide while lapping a backmarker on lap 33, and Hill edged ahead. On lap 39, when Alesi was coming up to lap David Brabham, they collided and both were out. Soon afterwards, Verstappen passed Brundle to take fifth. The second round of stops did not change anything. Hill won with Coulthard second, giving Williams a 1–2 and the lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, ahead of Häkkinen, Barrichello, Verstappen, and Brundle.

===Race 14: Europe===
To the new race in Jerez and there was major news. Schumacher was back after his ban, and with the CART season finished, Mansell replaced Coulthard for the remainder of the season in order to help Williams in the Constructors battle. Johnny Herbert was moved from Lotus to Ligier in place of Eric Bernard, who travelled the opposite way to partner Zanardi. Two new faces arrived at the back of the grid, as Hideki Noda joined Larrousse and Domenico &quot;Mimmo&quot; Schiattarella replaced Jean-Marc Gounon at Simtek. Schumacher took pole ahead of Hill, Mansell, Frentzen, Berger and Barrichello. At the start, Hill took the lead from Schumacher while Mansell went backwards, losing three places with Barrichello getting ahead of Berger. Hill led from Schumacher, Frentzen, Barrichello, Berger and Mansell.

Mansell quickly passed Berger and then Barrichello to get up to fourth. During the stops, Hill messed up and the team, afraid that he would lose the lead, sent him back out too quickly without giving him enough fuel. Schumacher however was already ahead and Hill had to stop again for fuel. When he rejoined, he was over 20 seconds behind. Mansell too was slow and Barrichello was ahead of him. Mansell tried to pass him and there was contact. Both had to pit, with Mansell dropping to seventh and Barrichello going well down.

The result was the same when Berger attacked Frentzen but damage was minor. They rejoined in sixth and seventh, behind Häkkinen, Irvine and Mansell, with Berger ahead. Mansell, now fifth, spun off on lap 48 into retirement while trying to close the gap to Irvine. Schumacher won ahead of Hill, Häkkinen, Irvine, Berger and Frentzen.

With just two more races to go, there was a major battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Schumacher led the championship with 86 points, but Hill was right behind with 81. Berger was third with 35, Häkkinen fourth with 26, Alesi fifth with 19, Barrichello sixth with 16, Coulthard seventh with 14 and Brundle eighth with 12. The Constructors&#x27; Championship was even closer as Benetton led with 97 points and Williams a mere 2 points behind with 95. Ferrari were third with 60, while McLaren were fourth with 38.

===Race 15: Japan===
More driver roulette followed before Japan. Benetton signed up Herbert from Ligier, in order to help them in the Constructors battle. This left Verstappen out of a drive for the last two races. JJ Lehto landed the Sauber seat for the remaining two races, vacated by Andrea de Cesaris who retired from the sport. Finn Mika Salo joined Lotus for the remainder of the season, Frenchman Franck Lagorce was promoted from Ligier test duties to race alongside Panis and Japanese driver Taki Inoue replaced Schiattarella for his home race. Mercedes-Benz ended months of speculation and confirmed their return to Formula 1 as an engine supplier for McLaren. Eddie Jordan immediately picked up a Peugeot works engine deal for his team for 1995.

Schumacher took pole ahead of Hill, Frentzen, Mansell, Herbert and Irvine. At the start the track was wet and it was raining heavily. Mansell went backwards again with Alesi getting ahead of Irvine. Schumacher was leading Hill, Frentzen, Herbert, Alesi and Irvine. Herbert spun off on lap 4 and retired, while Mansell soon passed Irvine.

On lap 14, Morbidelli crashed, and Brundle crashed off shortly after at the same point whilst the marshalls were still dealing with Morbidelli&#x27;s car. Although no-one was hit by the car, one marshall was hit by debris and suffered a broken leg; the race was stopped. The race restarted after some time behind the Safety Car and Frentzen ran wide into the first corner, dropping down three places. Schumacher, who was just ahead on track but 6 seconds ahead on aggregate pitted early on lap 19. He took on fresh tyres and a fuel load that was insufficient to last to the end of the race. He rejoined 17 seconds behind Hill on aggregate but got caught in traffic and soon the gap was up to 30 seconds before it stabilized. This meant that Hill rejoined 7 seconds ahead on lap 25 when he pitted and fueled to the end of the race, but only 3 of his tyres were changed due to a sticking wheel nut. This, coupled with Hill&#x27;s heavy fuel load appeared to hinder him and Schumacher began to close in.

On lap 36, Schumacher took the lead on aggregate, though he was still behind on the track. He pulled away rapidly, but he needed to pit again whereas Hill did not. On lap 40 Schumacher made his second stop, rejoining 15 seconds behind Hill on aggregate. Renowned for his ability in the wet and on fresher tyres, Schumacher closed in on Hill at a rate of over a second a lap, but ran out of time to catch him. Hill won by 3.3s to reduce his deficit in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 1 point, as well as giving Williams a 5-point lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship going into the last race, ahead of Schumacher, Alesi, Mansell, Irvine, and Frentzen.

===Race 16: Australia===
For the final race of the season Jean-Denis Délétraz replaced Erik Comas at Larrousse and Schiattarella was back with Simtek after Taki Inoue&#x27;s one-off deal at Suzuka. Peter Sauber confirmed a deal with a Ford engine for 1995.

Both championships were going to be decided in Australia and Mansell took pole ahead of Schumacher, Hill, Häkkinen, Barrichello, and Irvine. At the start, Mansell dropped backwards as was proving usual, with Irvine getting ahead of Barrichello, leaving the front six as Schumacher, Hill, Häkkinen, Irvine, Mansell, and Barrichello. Schumacher and Hill, separated by a second, pulled away at an astonishing rate from the rest of the field.

Mansell took fourth from Irvine on lap 10 and six laps later, Irvine spun off into the wall and retired. It did not take long for Mansell to pass Häkkinen but even then he was lapping over a second slower than Schumacher and Hill. During the stops, Schumacher and Hill stayed just over a second apart, while, behind, Berger got ahead of Alesi and both got ahead of Barrichello. Soon Berger passed Häkkinen, with Alesi following him through three laps later.

On lap 35, Schumacher went wide at the East Terrace corner and brushed the wall. He lost time but at the time, it was unclear whether his car was damaged or not. Hill was suddenly right behind him and saw his chance to pass, taking the inside line into the next corner. As Hill&#x27;s Williams drew alongside the Benetton, Schumacher appeared to turn in aggressively and there was contact between the two rival cars. The Benetton was then momentarily flung into the air and was damaged badly enough to mean immediate retirement for the German. Hill&#x27;s car initially appeared to be undamaged but it was soon apparent the Briton&#x27;s front left wishbone was broken. Hill toured back slowly to the pits and after some time trying to repair the damage, retired. Whether this accident had been deliberately caused by Schumacher – in the knowledge he had damaged his car in running wide at the East Terrace Corner – remains a matter of some debate, however it handed Michael Schumacher the first of his seven FIA Formula One World Championships.

Mansell and the two Ferraris fought for the lead, but Alesi lost a full lap and dropped down to eighth during the second round of stops because of trouble fixing a tyre and then stalling his car while trying to leave. Behind, Brundle got ahead of Barrichello. On lap 77, Häkkinen&#x27;s brakes failed, sending him into the wall and into retirement. Mansell took his 31st (and final) career win ahead of Berger, Brundle, Barrichello, Panis, and Alesi.

Thus, at the end of the season, Schumacher with 92 points pipped Hill on 91 by just one point. Controversy and speculation was abound about this result, but the FIA took no action as Williams did not protest; they were still dealing with the death of Senna, to whom Schumacher dedicated his title. Berger came third with 41, Häkkinen fourth with 26, Alesi fifth with 24, Barrichello sixth with 19, Brundle seventh with 16, and Coulthard eighth with 14. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams with 118 points beat Benetton with 103. Ferrari were third with 71, and McLaren were fourth with 42.

<text>The 1993 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 47th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1993 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1993 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 14 March and ended on 7 November. Alain Prost won his fourth and final Drivers&#x27; Championship. As of , this is the last championship for a French Formula One driver.

Furthermore, Prost achieved his 50th F1 victory at the British Grand Prix, becoming the first driver to reach this milestone. His fierce rival, Ayrton Senna, finished runner-up in the championship after winning five races for McLaren-Ford; these included his home race in Brazil, the European Grand Prix in wet conditions, and, for the fifth year in succession and sixth time in all, the Monaco Grand Prix. Prost&#x27;s Williams teammate, Damon Hill, took his first F1 victory in Hungary; two further victories gave him third in the championship.

At the end of the season, Prost retired from Grand Prix racing, bringing an end to an era in which he and Senna had largely dominated the sport. Senna would take Prost&#x27;s place at Williams, only to lose his life three races into the 1994 season.

1993 was notable for being the crux of a period in Formula One known for massive advances in technology in a very short time. The Williams FW15C of that year, for example, featured hydraulically and electronically controlled active suspension, power steering, anti-lock brakes, fly-by-wire controls, traction control, a semi-automatic gearbox that could be switched over to fully-automatic, highly sophisticated onboard telemetry, pneumatic valve springs in the engine, and even a &quot;push-to-pass&quot; system that, at least in theory, made overtaking easier. Williams also tested a continuously variable transmission, while Benetton-Ford tested a four-wheel steering system late in the season. Nearly all cars in 1993 had an active suspension system, which kept the car&#x27;s ride height consistent throughout a lap, making the aerodynamics of the car more efficient and effective. Many of these systems would be banned for .

Williams-Renault won their second consecutive Constructor&#x27;s Championship this year, the sixth in all for Williams.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1993 FIA Formula One World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Goodyear.

===Team changes===

The worldwide early 1990s recession had taken its toll: the Brabham, Andrea Moda and Fondmetal teams had failed to complete the season, while March formally withdrew at the beginning of 1993. Thus, there were only 13 teams on the grid at the opening race of 1993, in South Africa.

The Swiss Sauber team were the only new entry to the grid in 1993, with much-publicised backing from German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, who were funding the team&#x27;s engine supplier, Ilmor. Under the instruction of Mercedes, the engines were badged as &quot;Saubers&quot; for their debut season and &quot;Concept by Mercedes-Benz&quot; decals were placed on the car&#x27;s engine cover.

Jordan switched from using Yamaha V12 engines to the new Hart V10. Hart was making their F1 return after last being in Grand Prix racing in .

Numerous car number changes had taken place:

* Williams used the numbers 0 and 2 (see &quot;Driver changes&quot;).
* Benetton took the numbers 5 and 6, which Williams had used since .
* McLaren took the numbers 7 and 8, vacated by Brabham, rather than trading with Williams as was customary until the previous season. The team had previously used the same numbers in 1978–1984.
* Jordan took the numbers 14 and 15, vacated by Fondmetal.
* Larrousse took the numbers 19 and 20, which Benetton and its predecessor Toleman had used since 1984.
* New team Sauber took the numbers 29 and 30, which Larrousse had used since . These were now the highest numbers.
* The numbers 16 and 17, vacated by March, remained vacant until 1995.

===Driver changes===

1993 saw a major shake-up of drivers, especially among the top teams. Across the grid, a number of experienced drivers retired or moved to other series, and new faces emerged.

* Williams completed the signing of Alain Prost, who was returning to the sport after a year out in 1992. Although Nigel Mansell was the reigning World Champion, team owner Frank Williams would not guarantee him the number 1 driver status in the team next to the triple World Champion Prost, so he opted not to remain with the team to defend his title and moved to IndyCar racing in the US with Newman-Haas Racing to replace Michael Andretti who went to F1 with McLaren. Prost&#x27;s teammate would be Damon Hill, son of Graham Hill and Williams&#x27;s test driver in . The absence of the defending champion meant that Williams could not use the number 1 on their cars, so the number 0 was used instead, by Hill, while Prost used the number 2.
* Uncertainty surrounded the McLaren team, whose driver Ayrton Senna was reluctant to re-sign for 1993, as Honda had withdrawn from the sport and the team were not expected to be competitive with customer Ford engines. McLaren signed Michael Andretti, a successful IndyCar driver and son of World Champion Mario Andretti, and Mika Häkkinen, who had impressed for Team Lotus in and 1992. Senna eventually signed on a race-by-race basis before signing for the full season, moving Häkkinen into a test driver role.
* Benetton retained Michael Schumacher, but lost Martin Brundle, who was replaced after numerous run-ins and disagreements with team manager Flavio Briatore. Taking the second seat at Benetton was the most experienced driver in Formula One, Italian veteran Riccardo Patrese, who was released by Williams after just over five seasons with the team, despite having finished runner-up to Mansell in the championship of 1992.
* Ferrari retained Jean Alesi, but Ivan Capelli and Nicola Larini had both disappointed in 1992 and so Gerhard Berger returned to the team after three years at McLaren. Larini returned to his previous role as test driver for the team.
* Lotus retained Johnny Herbert and took on Alessandro Zanardi, who replaced Häkkinen.
* Tyrrell retained Andrea de Cesaris and took on Japan&#x27;s Ukyo Katayama, who moved from Larrousse.
* Ligier reunited British drivers Martin Brundle and Mark Blundell: the two had previously driven for Brabham in . This was the first and only time in Ligier&#x27;s history that they did not have a French driver in their line-up.
* Footwork Arrows took on British veteran Derek Warwick, returning to the sport after two years away driving sports cars (Jaguar in 1991 and Peugeot in 1992). Warwick had previously raced for Arrows in –. Japanese driver Aguri Suzuki was retained as number two driver.
* The BMS Scuderia Italia team switched from Dallara to Lola chassis and took on Michele Alboreto, a five-time race winner, with his last win eight years ago, and newcomer, Italian Luca Badoer, the 1992 International Formula 3000 champion.
* Jordan took on young debutant Brazilian Rubens Barrichello and ex-Ferrari driver Ivan Capelli.
* Larrousse signed Philippe Alliot, returning to the team after driving for Larrousse in 1987–1989, and Érik Comas, who moved from Ligier.
* Minardi retained Christian Fittipaldi and took on Fabrizio Barbazza.
* As their first pair of drivers, Sauber attracted Finland&#x27;s JJ Lehto, who moved from BMS Scuderia Italia, and Austria&#x27;s Karl Wendlinger, who had impressed with March in 1992. Wendlinger was also part of Sauber-Mercedes sportscar programme, prior to joining Formula One.

In all, only seven drivers who lined up on the grid in South Africa were with the same team they had been with the previous year: Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Jean Alesi, Johnny Herbert, Andrea de Cesaris, Aguri Suzuki and Christian Fittipaldi.

====Mid-season changes====
* McLaren: after the Italian Grand Prix, Mika Häkkinen stepped up from his position as test driver to take the place of Michael Andretti.
* Lotus: when Alessandro Zanardi had a huge crash in the Belgian Grand Prix, he was replaced by Portuguese debutant Pedro Lamy.
* Jordan Grand Prix: after Ivan Capelli drove two races, four other drivers took his seat during the rest of the season: Thierry Boutsen (10 races), Marco Apicella (1), test driver Emanuele Naspetti (1) and finally Eddie Irvine (2).
* Larrousse: Toshio Suzuki replaced Philippe Alliot for the final two races.
* Minardi: at the half point in the season, Fabrizio Barbazza was replaced by Pierluigi Martini, returning for his third stint with the team. Christian Fittipaldi was replaced by Jean-Marc Gounon for the final two races of the season.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Mexican Grand Prix left the calendar after seven years, due to safety concerns surrounding the very bumpy surface of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez. (It would return in ).
* The &quot;Asian Grand Prix&quot; was scheduled to be raced on 4 April, at the Autopolis circuit in Japan. However, the plans failed to materialise and the race was cancelled.
* The 1993 season saw the return of the European Grand Prix to the calendar after eight years. It was held at Donington Park.
* The San Marino Grand Prix and Spanish Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar, so that the Spanish round was second in the usual European leg (not counting the stand-in race at Donington).

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
Various changes were implemented to the cars in order to reduce cornering speeds:
* A reduction of the cars&#x27; track from to 
* A reduction in tyre width: the rears going from to .
* The maximum height of the rear wing was reduced from to , measured from the ground.
* The maximum overhang of the front wing was reduced from to .

Also, the surface area of the driver&#x27;s headrest was increased from to .

===Sporting and event regulations===
The pit lane speed limit was lowered to in practice sessions.

Severe crowd control measures were imposed to stop spectators entering the track at the end of the race, and most certainly before that.

====Mid-season changes====
After the first race of the season, two changes were made to the qualifying system:
* Each driver was limited to 12 laps in both qualifying sessions. This lasted until the end of the season.
* Originally, the number of cars allowed to start for the race was reduced from 26 to 24. But to ensure that every team could qualify at least one car, the teams unanimously agreed to raise this number to 25. This meant that every time, there was one driver not allowed to start. However, prior to the German Grand Prix, seeing that that one car was almost always a Scuderia Italia, the teams unanimously agreed to allow all 26 cars to qualify again.

==Race-by-race==
===Round 1: South Africa===
The season began in Kyalami, where Prost took pole position ahead of Senna in second. Prost had a poor start and with Senna and Hill overtaking him. Hill spun in front of Prost and lost position, while Prost let Schumacher through into second position. Senna led ahead of Schumacher by the end of the first lap.

Prost overtook Schumacher for second place on lap 13. On lap 18 Prost attempted to overtake Senna, but Senna took the defensive inside line. However, on lap 25 Prost overtook Senna for the lead, whilst Schumacher passed Senna for second position. Shortly after Senna and Schumacher pitted with Senna rejoining ahead.

Schumacher attempted to overtake Senna on lap 40 but came into contact with Senna&#x27;s car and spun, retiring him from the race. Patrese was holding third position when he spun on lap 47 as Fittipaldi passed Lehto. Prost won the race with Senna in second position, Blundell in third, Fittipaldi in fourth and Lehto in fifth.

This was the final South African Grand Prix to date.

===Round 2: Brazil===
Brazilian qualifying ended with a Williams front row, with Prost on pole and Hill in second. Senna qualified in third, with Schumacher in fourth and Andretti in fifth. Senna got ahead of Hill at the beginning of the race as behind him Andretti collided with Berger after being challenged by Wendlinger. Andretti then hit the barriers launching him directly over Berger&#x27;s car, both drivers were uninjured. This meant that they both retired from the race, as did Brundle and Barbazza.

On lap 4 Patrese retired due to suspension failure. Whilst Prost extended his lead, Senna was under pressure from Hill who overtook him for second place on lap 11. On lap 25 Senna was given a stop-go penalty after overtaking a backmarker under yellow flags, which meant he re-entered the race behind Schumacher. Heavy rain then caused many drivers to spin with Fittipaldi and Prost retiring. Fittipaldi spun on lap 30 and as he was returning to the track Prost crashed into him. After the accident the safety car was brought out with Hill leading the race.

As the track began to dry out drivers stopped for dry tyres and during Schumacher&#x27;s pit-stop his car fell off its jack. Schumacher rejoined the race behind Senna with Herbert and Blundell gaining pace. Shortly after Senna overtook Hill for first position and quickly began to pull away. Behind him Schumacher and Alesi were given stop-go penalties for overtaking under a yellow flag. Schumacher re-entered the race in fifth position and Alesi in ninth. Schumacher quickly overtook Blundell and Herbert to finish third. Senna won his first race of the season, with Hill in second position, followed by Schumacher, Herbert, Blundell and Alessandro Zanardi. Zanardi&#x27;s 6th place would be his only points finish in Formula One.

===Round 3: Europe===
After a deal to host a race at the newly constructed Autopolis circuit in Japan fell through, it was replaced with the European Grand Prix, which was held at the historic Donington Park in Leicestershire, United Kingdom, this being the first time this circuit had hosted Grand Prix cars since the late 1930s. Williams qualified 1–2 for the second race in a row, Prost once again taking pole position. Schumacher took third, Senna fourth and Wendlinger in fifth. The race began in damp conditions with Schumacher blocking Senna meaning that they both lost time to Wendlinger, who took third. During the following lap Senna overtook four cars in quick succession to lead the race. Senna took Schumacher in the third corner, Wendlinger at Craner Curves, Hill at Coppice Corner and then Prost at the Melbourne Hairpin.

Behind Senna, Schumacher passed Wendlinger quickly, but when Andretti tried to overtake Wendlinger he crashed straight into him, meaning that they both retired from the race. This accident meant that Andretti had retired from his third consecutive race due to collision damage. As the track began to dry the drivers pitted for dry tyres. Lehto retired from fifth position on lap 14 because of handling problems. Berger moved up to fifth but also retired on lap 22 due to suspension problems. As it started to rain again drivers pitted for wet tyres. Schumacher decided to stay out, but crashed out from the lead due to that decision. As the track began to dry again drivers pitted once again, with Senna suffering problems meaning that the lost twenty seconds in the pit-stop, in which time Prost retook the lead.

As the rain began to fall yet again the Williams pitted for wet tyres, with Senna staying out on dry tyres. Senna&#x27;s decision proved correct as the track began to dry quickly. Prost suffered a problem in the pits when the Williams pitted for dry tyres. This pushed him down into fourth position, a full lap behind Senna. As it began to rain for the fourth time, Barrichello pitted, losing his second-place position to Hill. Barrichello quickly retired due to fuel pressure problems. Senna won the race (by over one minute) with Hill in second and Prost in third.

===Round 4: San Marino===
In San Marino Williams occupied the first two positions on the grid, with Prost taking his fourth consecutive pole position. Schumacher qualified third, Senna in fourth and Wendlinger in fifth. As the race began Prost was overtaken by Hill and Senna, Senna easily getting past Schumacher. By the end of the first lap Hill was leading, followed by Senna, Prost, Schumacher and Wendlinger.

Hill pulled away whilst Prost was stuck behind Senna. Prost overtook Senna on lap 8 and set off in pursuit of Hill. Soon it was time for pit stops with Senna passing Prost. On lap 17 Prost overtook both Hill and Senna whilst battling backmarkers. Senna also got ahead of Hill. Soon after, on lap 21, Hill retired with brake failure. As the race progressed both McLaren cars retired from the race with Andretti spinning out from fifth position on lap 33 and ten laps later Senna retired with a hydraulic failure. Alesi, who managed to take Andretti&#x27;s fifth position soon spun off because of a clutch failure.

Schumacher had made it up to second position with Wendlinger close behind; however, Wendlinger retired on lap 49 with engine failure. Prost won the race with Schumacher in second, Brundle in third, Lehto in fourth and Alliot in fifth.

===Round 5: Spain===
In Spain Prost once again out-qualified Hill who was in second position on the grid. In third was Senna, fourth was Schumacher and Patrese took fifth position. Hill had an exceptionally good start to the race, overtaking his pole position teammate. By the end of the first lap Hill was comfortably in the lead followed by Prost, Senna, Schumacher and Patrese.

Hill and Prost had built up a large lead by lap 11 and continued to move ahead through the field during the pit stops. Hill even managed to extend his lead over Prost, whilst Schumacher was beginning to challenge Senna. Schumacher attempted an overtaking manoeuvre on Senna, but instead left the track, going over a sand trap. He lost fifteen seconds, but crucially not his race position. As Hill began to close in on Prost, after losing position, Prost&#x27;s Williams began to handle oddly and on lap 41 Hill retired from the race due to engine failure.

The following lap Wendlinger retired from the race due to problems with his fuel system. Prost took his third victory of the season, followed by Senna, Schumacher, Patrese and Andretti.

===Round 6: Monaco===
At the Monaco Grand Prix Prost took pole once again, but his teammate, Hill, only managed to qualify in fourth position, failing to out-qualify Schumacher in second and Senna in third. Blundell was forced off the track at Sainte Devote with suspension damage in the second Ligier before he eventually crashed out by lap 4 as the first retirement. By the end of the first lap there was no change in position at the front of the grid with Prost leading, Schumacher in second, Senna third, Hill fourth and Alesi fifth.

Shortly after Prost was penalised for jumping the start and was issued with a stop-go penalty by the stewards. He entered the pits on lap 12 and then stalled his car when he exited the pits. By the time he was out of the pits again he was in seventeenth position and a lap down. Schumacher was now comfortably in the lead and pulling away as Alesi allowed his teammate Berger to pass him. By lap 33 Schumacher had slowed down considerably and then retired from the race with a hydraulics problem in a cloud of smoke. Behind him however Prost was easily making his way back through the field.

As cars started pitting there was no change in order of the race leaders. However Prost had now managed to get himself into seventh position. He gained another place shortly after as Patrese retired on lap 54 with an engine failure. Prost then passed Fittipaldi for fifth position. Herbert crashed out in the second Lotus with gearbox problems that he was having for more 20 laps (subsequently). On lap 71 Berger attempted to overtake Hill and ended up making contact. Hill quickly rejoined the race but Berger was forced to retire. Senna won his third race of the season, followed by Hill in second, Alesi third, Prost fourth and Fittipaldi fifth.

===Round 7: Canada===
For the only North American race in Montreal, Williams qualified first and second, with Prost taking pole position yet again. The Benettons of Schumacher and Patrese took third and fourth positions and the two Ferraris of Berger and Alesi taking fifth and sixth. Hill had a good start and beat Prost off the line, the Benettons were slow to start and were overtaken by Berger and Senna (Senna had qualified eight). By the end of the first lap Hill was leading followed by Prost, Berger, Senna and Schumacher.

On the second lap Senna overtook Berger to take third position. On lap 6 Prost took the lead from Hill. Shortly after Schumacher passed Berger and five laps later so did teammate Patrese. By lap 15 Prost was leading followed by Hill, Senna, Schumacher and Patrese.

During the pit stops Hill encountered a problem and his pace slowed allowing Senna and Schumacher to pass him. This gave Schumacher the opportunity to chase down Senna for second position. Senna, with Schumacher closing in fast, suffered an electrical failure, meaning he had to retire from the race. The race was won by Prost (celebrating his fourth win of the season) followed by Schumacher, Hill, Berger and Brundle, the first of a four-win streak which would see him distance himself from Senna in the battle for the championship.

===Round 8: France===
At the French Grand Prix there was a huge turnout of fans to see French driver Prost take his eighth consecutive pole position. However it was Hill that took pole position with Prost in second. Behind the Williams 1–2 were the two Ligiers of Brundle and Blundell with Senna taking fifth position on the grid. As the race started Schumacher managed to pass Alesi to get into sixth position with no change in order to the top five drivers.

The Williams cars pulled away from the rest of the pack with Brundle also pulling away from Blundell, who was keeping up Senna and Schumacher. However, on lap 21 Blundell spun off under pressure from Senna and had to retire. During the mid-race pit stops Prost managed to get ahead of Hill as Senna and Schumacher closed the gap behind Brundle.

During the second set of pit stops Prost was still leading, albeit by two-tenths of a second and Senna and Schumacher overtook the Ligier of Brundle. Shortly after Schumacher passed Senna in traffic and began to pull away. Prost won the race followed by Hill, Schumacher, Senna and Brundle.

At this point in the season (halfway through) Prost was leading the World Championship with 57 points. Senna was in second with 45 points. In third place was Hill with 28 points. Schumacher took fourth place with 24 points, and Brundle was in fifth place with 9 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship Williams were easily ahead of McLaren with 85 points compared to their 48. Benetton were third with 29 points, and Ligier were fourth with 15.

===Round 9: Britain===
As Nigel Mansell had retired from Formula One the previous year, the British crowd were mainly rooting for Damon Hill, considering his good start to the season. The Williams cars took their usual positions on the grid, 1–2, with Prost in pole position and Hill in second. Fellow Brit Martin Brundle took sixth position on the grid with Patrese in fifth, Senna in fourth and Schumacher in third. As the race began Hill managed to get ahead of Prost and Senna got ahead of Schumacher. An enthusiastic home crowd cheered as Hill completed the first lap in first position followed by Senna, Prost, Schumacher and Patrese.

Andretti spun off at Copse on the first lap ending his race immediately, while Hill was extending his lead both Prost and Schumacher were unable to pass Senna. Prost finally managed to overtake on the ninth lap, but Hill&#x27;s lead at this point was over five seconds. On lap 13 Schumacher overtook Senna for third position and quickly pulled away from the Brazilian. Prost managed to close in on Hill, narrowing the gap to three seconds during the mid-race pit stops. Shortly after, Badoer retired with electrical failure, bringing out the Safety Car and reducing the three second gap between the Williams drivers to no gap at all. Two laps after the Safety Car Hill&#x27;s engine blew, meaning he had to retire from the race. Fellow Brit Brundle&#x27;s gearbox failed on lap 54.

On the final lap of the race Senna retired for the third consecutive season at Silverstone as his McLaren ran out of fuel. Prost took his sixth win of the season and the fiftieth of his career. In second position was Schumacher, Patrese third, fourth was Johnny Herbert (one of only three remaining Brits in the race) and Senna was classified fifth.

===Round 10: Germany===
Williams took the front row of the grid in Hockenheim with Prost in Pole Position. Schumacher took third followed by Senna and Blundell. Prost had a poor start with Hill easily passing him as the lights went out. Senna also had a poor start, spinning, sending him to the back of the grid. He almost immediately gained a place however when Brundle also spun, at the chicane. Hill led by the end of the first lap followed by Schumacher, Prost, Blundell and Patrese.

Prost picked up speed after his poor start, passing Schumacher on lap 6. By lap 9 he was near Hill. However behind him Berger attempted to overtake Suzuki ending in a collision with Suzuki spinning off. The Marshals waved yellow flags and Hill slowed down slightly. Prost saw and opportunity and overtook Hill for the lead. Shortly after he was given a stop-go penalty for overtaking under yellow flag conditions, sending him down the grid and into fifth position, where he was struck from behind by Benetton of Patrese. Meanwhile, Senna was making good progress through the pack following his spin at the beginning.

Unlike the rest of the cars on the track Senna and the two Williams did not pit meaning Hill had a fifteen-second lead over Prost, with Senna up to seventh. The Brazilian soon passed Berger for sixth position and then three laps later Patrese for fifth. By the penultimate lap Prost was seven second behind Hill when his left rear tyre punctured spinning him out and bringing his retirement from the race. Prost won his seventh and final race of the season. Schumacher finished second followed by Blundell, Senna and Patrese.

===Round 11: Hungary===
Prost secured pole in Hungary followed by teammate Hill. Schumacher took third position on the grid followed by Senna and Patrese. On the parade lap Prost stalled meaning that he had to start the race from the back of the grid. Schumacher had a poor start to the race and was quickly passed by Senna, Berger and Patrese. By the end of the first lap Hill was leading followed by Senna, Berger, Patrese and Schumacher.

Schumacher attempted to overtake Patrese on lap 4, but in the process spun, sending him down to tenth. Both McLaren cars were suffering with throttle problems and as Andretti slowed down in front of Schumacher on lap 16 he spun again forcing him down into fourteenth position, just behind Prost who was making his way back up the field. On lap 18 Senna was forced to retire with throttle problems. As cars pitted, Schumacher and the two Williams stayed out, closing the gap between Hill, Prost and Schumacher. By the end of this lap Hill was leading, followed by Patrese, Prost, Schumacher and Berger.

Shortly after Prost began suffering problems with his rear wing, forcing him to pit, rejoining the race seven laps behind. On lap 23 Alesi spun off and hit armco barrier over the gravel trap and retired whilst trying to lap backmarkers and Patrese let Schumacher past him. This put Schumacher into second place, however three laps later he had to retire because of fuel pump problems. Berger pitted from third and rejoined the race fifth, but quickly overtook Brundle and then Warwick to reclaim third position. Hill won the race, his first ever Formula One victory. Patrese finished in second followed by Berger, Warwick and Brundle.

===Round 12: Belgium===
Williams took another grid 1–2 with Prost out qualifying Hill again. Schumacher qualified third, Alesi fourth and Senna fifth. At the beginning of the race Schumacher suffered another poor start allowing Alesi and Senna to pass him. By the end of the first lap Prost was leading followed by Hill, Senna, Alesi and Schumacher.

On lap 4 Alesi was forced to retire because of problems with his suspension, allowing Schumacher to take fourth position. He then set off after Senna and overtook him on lap 10 by going on the grass to get around him. The first wave of pit stops did not change the order at the front of the pack with Prost still leading, followed by Hill, Schumacher, Senna and Suzuki. On lap 15 Suzuki&#x27;s gearbox failed and he had to retire from the race. Prost had trouble in the pits during his second stop meaning that Senna and Schumacher rejoined the race ahead of him.

On lap 41 Prost beat the lap record while he was chasing down Schumacher discovering that since he was only one-tenth-of-a-second quicker he couldn&#x27;t chase the other two down and thus had to settle for third. Hill won the race, ending the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with Schumacher second, Prost third, Senna fourth, and Herbert fifth.

The Belgian Grand Prix was three quarters of the way through 1993&#x27;s calendar and Prost was leading the World Championship with 81 points. Senna was second with 54 points, Hill was third with 48 points, Schumacher was fourth with 42 points, and Patrese was fifth with 18 points. As a result of this race Williams had won the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 129 points ahead of Benetton with 60, and McLaren with 56 points.

===Round 13: Italy===
As usual the two Williams cars took the front two positions on the grid at Monza, with Prost again out qualifying Hill. Alesi qualified third, Senna fourth and Schumacher fifth. As the lights went out Alesi managed to get ahead of Hill and as Senna tried to do the same there was contact sending Senna into ninth place and Hill into tenth. Midway through the lap Schumacher took second position from Alesi and as they finished the first lap Prost was in the lead, followed by Schumacher, Alesi, Berger and Herbert.

At the end of lap 8 Prost was still leading ahead of his two main championship rivals Senna and Hill, who were both outside of the points. As Senna tried to take sixth position from Brundle they collided and the accident retired both of them from the race. Hill had gained two places as a result of the collision and was now in sixth. He gained a further two places when Johnny Herbert spun out into the tyre barrier at Parabolica on lap 15 and Berger&#x27;s suspension failed on the following lap. On lap 18 he passed Alesi and on lap 22 Schumacher&#x27;s engine failed. Blundell had also hit the barrier at Parabolica like Herbert and retired with a right rear puncture just after pitting by lap 21. This left Hill in second position, five seconds behind Prost.

At the end of lap 48, five from the end, Prost still led Hill by two seconds, and looked set to seal his fourth Drivers&#x27; Championship. But on lap 49, the Frenchman&#x27;s engine failed. This allowed Hill to take his third consecutive win, with Alesi in a fine second, Andretti third, Wendlinger fourth and Patrese fifth.

===Round 14: Portugal===
Two major news stories broke as Formula One descended on Estoril, Portugal. Firstly Alain Prost announced that after only a year back in the sport that he would retire at the end of the 1993 season. Secondly Michael Andretti had been fired from McLaren after a very poor performance during the season (his podium finish in Italy was notwithstanding). Mika Häkkinen, the team&#x27;s test driver, would be his replacement. Häkkinen would stay with the team until his retirement in 2001 after nine years.

The Williams cars qualified in their usual 1–2 position, but this time it was Hill that was in Pole Position with Prost in second. For his first race at McLaren Häkkinen qualified third ahead of Senna in fourth and Alesi in fifth. Despite being on Pole Position, Hill stalled his car during the parade lap and had to start the race from the back of the grid. As the lights went out Prost was overtaken by Alesi and the two McLarens with Alesi ahead of Senna and Senna ahead of Häkkinen. By the end of the first lap Alesi was in the lead followed by Senna, Häkkinen, Prost and Schumacher.

The top five stayed close together, however the two Williams&#x27;s cars and Schumacher were on a one-stop strategy unlike the McLarens and the Ferraris. On lap 20, whilst Alesi, Häkkinen and Schumacher were in the pits, Senna&#x27;s engine blew, meaning he had to retire from the race. Alesi lost position to Häkkinen and Schumacher during the pit stop. This left Prost leading ahead of Blundell, Hill, Häkkinen, and Schumacher. The German passed Häkkinen on lap 25 and began to pull away. Prost stopped on lap 29, however Schumacher rejoined the race ahead of him. When Hill stopped Schumacher was leading followed by Prost, Häkkinen, Hill and Alesi.

On lap 33 Häkkinen crashed into the wall at the last corner, and on lap 36 Berger&#x27;s suspension failed. Blundell crashed out of the race from sixth position on lap 52 as Prost began to make a move on Schumacher. Second place, however, was all Prost needed to win the championship so he decided not to take any risks. Patrese was doing well in fifth position but on lap 64 he also crashed out of the race. Schumacher had a minor incident but continued, so he could keep the lead. Schumacher won his second Grand Prix Race (the first being the Belgian Grand Prix the year before). Prost finished second, making him the 1993 Formula One World Champion. Hill finished third, Alesi fourth, and Wendlinger fifth.

With only two races to follow the Portuguese Grand Prix, Prost, with a 34-point lead over Senna, was crowned the 1993 Formula One World Champion (his fourth World Championship). There was however still a battle for second position between Hill, Senna, and Schumacher. Hill was second with 62 points, Senna third with 53, Schumacher fourth with 52 and Patrese fifth with 20 points. Williams had already won the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the Belgian Grand Prix, but again there was still a battle for second between Benetton (72 points) and McLaren (60 points). Ferrari was fourth with 23 points.

Backmarker team Scuderia Italia withdrew from Formula One after this race.

===Round 15: Japan===
Prost took pole position at the Suzuka circuit in Japan. Senna had qualified second, Häkkinen third, Schumacher fourth and Berger fifth. Disappointingly Hill only managed to qualify sixth. At the beginning of the race Senna managed to pass Prost and Berger overtook Schumacher. Eddie Irvine (the fifth driver to occupy Jordan&#x27;s second seat that year) managed to overtake Hill and then Schumacher. Hill briefly overtook Schumacher but the German very quickly regained his place. Senna was leading by the end of the first lap followed by Prost, Häkkinen, Berger and Irvine. Schumacher passed Irvine on the second lap with Hill passing him two laps later.

Schumacher and Hill then closed in on Berger. At the end of lap 9 the three cars came out of the final chicane nose to tail as Hill passed Schumacher on the main straight to take fifth position. On lap 11 Hill got a very good run at overtaking Berger going into the chicane. Berger took the inside line and Hill tried to overtake on the outside, but had to give up on the move. Schumacher having stayed on the inside was unable to stop in time and ended up hitting Hill&#x27;s right rear tyre damaging his left front suspension and resulting in his retirement from the race. Hill came out of the accident unscathed and managed to make up a place on the following lap when Berger pitted.

At the front of the pack Prost had taken the lead when Senna pitted. Shortly after it began to rain, which was a major advantage for Prost and those drivers that hadn&#x27;t pitted, as they would only have to do one less stop. Senna began to catch Prost as the track became wet and on lap 21 as the rain became heavier Senna overtook the Frenchman on the approach to the Spoon Curve. At the end of the lap Senna&#x27;s lead was over two seconds and the pair pitted for wet tyres. Senna pulled away rapidly and by lap 27 his lead was over thirty seconds. Prost then left the track at the first corner, but was able to rejoin the race behind Senna, one lap down. Unable to lap Hill Senna was re-passed by Irvine, who had already been lapped, but was chasing Hill for fourth position. Irvine, who was also still on wets, challenged Hill going into the first corner, but was unable to complete the move, whilst Senna was being held up by the pair. Senna lost fifteen seconds behind the pair once he had forced his way through. At the end of lap 42 both Senna and Prost pitted for Slicks and Senna&#x27;s lead was back up to twenty-four seconds.

Behind, Barrichello passed Irvine during the stop for wet tyres. On lap 41 Berger&#x27;s engine failed resulting in his retirement. With four laps to go and battling Warwick for sixth position, Irvine ran into the back of him forcing Warwick to retire. Irvine managed to continue and scored a point in his first race. His debut was marred slightly by the events of the post-race meeting where he and Senna exchanged strong words and Senna punched him. Senna won the race followed by Prost in second, Häkkinen in third which was his first ever podium finish, Hill fourth, Barrichello&#x27;s fifth-place finish was the best of his career to that point, with Irvine finishing sixth in his debut Formula One race.

===Round 16: Australia===
The last race of the 1993 season took place in Adelaide, South Australia. If Williams took pole position at this race they would have been on pole for the entire season, however in Adelaide it was Senna that started the race in pole position. Prost was second on the grid, Hill third, Schumacher fourth and Häkkinen fifth. As the race started the top four stayed in the same order, however Berger jumped Häkkinen for fifth position.

While Senna started to pull away slightly the two Williams and Schumacher stayed close together. Schumacher passed Hill on lap 8 and then set about passing Prost. He had to pit early, on lap 15, and rejoined fourth. However, his engine failed five laps later. During the first set of pit stops Häkkinen was slow and Alesi and Brundle managed to get ahead of him. Nine laps after Schumacher retired due to engine failure Häkkinen was forced to do the same.

During the second set of pit stops Senna kept his ten-second lead whilst Alesi managed to get ahead of Berger and Patrese passed Brundle. On lap 61 Hill attempted to overtake Prost by surprise for second place. However, as Prost moved over to block him Hill had to back off and ended up spinning, losing time but not his position. Patrese was set to finish sixth in his 256th and final race, but his fuel pressure dropped on the final lap. Senna won the final race of the season, with Prost finishing second in his final Formula One race. Hill finished third, followed by Alesi in fourth and Berger in fifth.

At the end of the season Prost finished his one-year return to Formula One with the World Championship and 99 career points. His rival, Senna, finished second with 73 points. In third was Hill with 69 points. Fourth was Schumacher with 52 points. Fifth place in the championship went to Patrese, who had earned 20 points. Williams dominated the Constructors&#x27; Championship throughout the year finishing first with 168 points. This was double the points of McLaren who finished second.

<text>The 1992 Formula One World Championship was the 46th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1992 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1992 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 1 March and ended on 8 November. Nigel Mansell won the Drivers&#x27; Championship and Williams-Renault won the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Mansell won the first five races of the season and went on to become the first driver in Formula One history to win nine World Championship races in a single season. He sealed the championship at the Hungarian Grand Prix in mid-August, with five races still to run, becoming the first British driver to win the championship since James Hunt in . Reigning champion Ayrton Senna won three races for McLaren-Honda but could only manage fourth in the championship, with Mansell&#x27;s Williams teammate Riccardo Patrese finishing second and young Michael Schumacher third for Benetton-Ford.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1992 FIA Formula One World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Goodyear. This was the first season in which all teams ran two cars.

===Team changes===
* March completed a take-over of Leyton House Racing.
* Modena designed a car for 1992, but had to cease operations before the season started, due to insurmountable financial challenges.
* After a one-year spell with Lamborghini, Ligier signed a three-year full-works engine deal with Renault. They received the same treatment as Williams, by utilizing the same engine specifications.
* Lamborghini moved on to supply Minardi and Larrousse, who collaborated with Venturi Automobiles.
* Judd supplied Team Lotus and BMS Scuderia Italia in , but moved on to Brabham and Andrea Moda in 1992. Lotus was supplied by Ford, BMS received a 1991-spec Ferrari engine.
* Brabham&#x27;s former supplier, Yamaha, moved to Jordan.
* After preparing the Honda engines for Tyrrell in 1991, Mugen Motorsports made their public debut as supplier to Footwork. Tyrrell moved on to engine supplier Ilmor.

====Mid-season changes====

* After being in Formula 1 since , Brabham went into administration 11 races into the 1992 season.
* Andrea Moda was expelled from the championship after 12 races, on the regulatory grounds of &quot;[failure to operate a] team in a manner compatible with the standards of the championship or in any way brings the championship into disrepute.&quot;
* The Fondmetal team ran out of money after 13 races.

====Post-season====
* March left the sport after more than twenty years in F1.

===Driver changes===
* After Alain Prost was released from his contract with Ferrari before the season ended, the team attracted Ivan Capelli.
* Three-time world champion Nelson Piquet retired and Benetton attracted Martin Brundle, coming from Brabham.
* Brabham signed Eric van de Poele and Giovanna Amati, the first female F1 driver since Desiré Wilson in . Ex-driver Mark Blundell could not find a seat for 1992.
* Stefano Modena and Andrea de Cesaris switched employers, Modena going to Jordan and De Cesaris to Tyrrell. Jordan also signed Maurício Gugelmin from Leyton House, while Tyrrell replaced the retired Satoru Nakajima with Olivier Grouillard.
* Pierluigi Martini moved from Minardi to Scuderia Italia, replacing Emanuele Pirro making place at Minardi for debutant Christian Fittipaldi.
* Aguri Suzuki moved from Larrousse to Footwork, freeing a seat for newcomer and fellow Japanese Ukyo Katayama. Ex-Footwork driver Alex Caffi moved to Andrea Moda, besides Enrico Bertaggia.
* Andrea Chiesa debuted with Fondmetal, the team fielding a second car for the first time.

====Mid-season changes====
* After three races, Giovanna Amati was replaced by Williams test driver Damon Hill, while he was still competing in the F3000.
* Before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Andrea Chiesa was replaced at Fondmetal by Eric van de Poele, coming from the defunct Brabham team. Unfortunately, Fondmetal folded just three races later.
* At March, Emanuele Naspetti left the F3000 championship while he was leading, to replace Paul Belmondo, and Jan Lammers made a surprise comeback when he replaced Karl Wendlinger for the final two races of the season. Lammers set a record by returning a full ten years after his initial final race.
* Christian Fittipaldi was replaced at Minardi by Alessandro Zanardi when he crashed during qualifying of the French Grand Prix. After three races, the Brazilian returned.
* Ferrari promoted their test driver and ITCC champion Nicola Larini to the racing seat. He had helped develop their active suspension system and when it was time to launch the car with that upgrade, Larini was awarded the drive.
* After just two races, Andrea Moda separated with both drivers and hired Roberto Moreno and Perry McCarthy.

==Calendar==

===Calendar changes===
* The United States Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 15 March at the Phoenix street circuit, which was to be the second round as a result of the return of South Africa but was cancelled due to the inability to install more seats in order to attract spectators. 
* This made way for the return of the South African Grand Prix. After a seven-year absence, the FIA lifted its ban on events in South Africa due to the end of Apartheid. The race was held again at Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit, but there was a new layout compared to the last time they raced in 1985.
* The Mexican Grand Prix was moved from its mid-June date to March and the Spanish Grand Prix was moved from September to May.
* The Austrian Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 16 August, was cancelled due to financial problems. The Hungarian Grand Prix moved up from 23 August to take its slot.
* The European Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 4 October at the Jerez circuit, was cancelled.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* Unleaded gasoline fuel became mandatory for all Formula One cars from the 1992 season onwards, as leaded gasoline fuel was deemed too hazardous for health. Previously, unleaded gasoline fuel was optional for top teams only.
* Stricter crash tests were introduced.

===Sporting and event regulations===
* The use of the Safety Car was formalised.
* Circuits were demanded to lower the kerbs, to widen the pit lane to at least 12 meters and to add a chicane in the pit lane entry.

==Race-by-race==

===Race 1: South Africa===
The season started off in South Africa at the newly rebuilt Kyalami circuit near the high altitude city of Johannesburg where Mansell took pole ahead of Senna, Berger, Patrese, Alesi and Schumacher. At the start, Patrese overtook both McLarens and Berger lost out to both Alesi and Schumacher as well. The order was: Mansell, Patrese, Senna, Alesi, Schumacher and Berger.

Mansell quickly pulled away from Patrese who was under no pressure at all from Senna. Brundle spun off on the first lap in the Benetton and then retired with a broken clutch. Alesi was well behind Senna and had a comfortable gap to Schumacher, whom Berger could do nothing about. The pit stops left the order unchanged, and it held until Alesi&#x27;s engine failed on lap 41. Andrea de Cesaris was sixth and in the points for one lap until his engine failed as well.

Mansell won the race easily with Patrese making it a Williams 1–2 ahead of Senna, Schumacher, Berger and Johnny Herbert. Mansell had also won the previous South African Grand Prix, held in 1985, in a Williams-Honda.

===Race 2: Mexico===

The cancellation of the United States Grand Prix on a street circuit in Phoenix, Arizona, originally scheduled for 15 March left a 3-week gap between the first two races, and there was some controversy surrounding the next race in Mexico: the venue for this race, the Hermanos Rodríguez Autodrome in Mexico City (an even higher altitude city) had an appallingly bumpy track surface, thanks to the circuit being located on a geologically active area. It also had a dauntingly fast final corner called the Peraltada which was 180 degrees and banked. Although the banking had been eased from the previous year, making the corner slightly slower, the bumps were still disastrous as Ayrton Senna hit a nasty bump in the Esses and crashed into a concrete wall, receiving severe bruising. He was cleared fit enough to race.

The Williams cars were 1–2 in qualifying in Mexico ahead of the Benettons and the McLarens with Mansell on pole ahead of Patrese, Schumacher, Brundle, Berger and Senna. At the start, Senna blasted past his teammate and the Benettons with Brundle getting ahead of Schumacher. The order was: Mansell, Patrese, Senna, Brundle, Schumacher and Berger.

Schumacher quickly passed Brundle on lap 2 and soon afterwards there was a big queue behind Senna, who was apparently having some sort of trouble. Schumacher got past on lap 7 and the rest were relieved of being stuck up when Senna retired with transmission troubles on lap 11.

After the stops, Berger got ahead of Brundle only to be passed two laps later. Berger repassed Brundle on lap 36. Brundle got back ahead on lap 39 only for Berger to repass him two laps later. Brundle was back in fourth on lap 44 but retired with engine trouble three laps later, ending the battle for fourth. At the front, Mansell won with Patrese making it a Williams 1–2 again ahead of Schumacher, Berger, de Cesaris and Mika Häkkinen.

===Race 3: Brazil===
For the Brazilian Grand Prix at the Interlagos circuit in São Paulo, the Williamses were ahead of the McLarens with Mansell on pole ahead of Patrese with Senna third in front of his home crowd ahead of Berger, Schumacher and Alesi. On the parade lap, Berger stalled and had to start at the back. At the start, Mansell was poor and Patrese blasted ahead of him with Brundle getting ahead of Alesi. The order was: Patrese, Mansell, Senna, Schumacher, Brundle and Alesi.

Berger had to retire after only 4 laps in the pits with electrical failure. The Williamses pulled away while Senna was holding the rest at bay; Schumacher was 30 seconds behind by the time he had passed Senna for third on lap 13. Brundle and Alesi passed him soon afterwards and Senna retired with engine troubles on lap 17.

The stops brought Alesi closer to Brundle and Alesi made his move on lap 31. The two collided, with Brundle spinning out. This promoted Karl Wendlinger to fifth and he was there until his clutch failed on lap 56. As Thierry Boutsen collided with Érik Comas and forced Johnny Herbert off into the gravel at the Senna S as it forced both drivers to retire but Comas managed to continue, just 6 laps after Brundle&#x27;s retirement. Meanwhile, Mansell pitted while passing back markers and took advantage of subsequent clear laps, taking over first place when Patrese pitted after slower laps passing more of the back markers. Mansell then built a lead and won with a 29-second lead over Patrese in second, making it yet another Williams 1–2 ahead of Schumacher, Alesi, Capelli and Michele Alboreto.

===Race 4: Spain===
Mansell was on pole once again in Spain at the Catalunya circuit in Montmeló ahead of Schumacher, Senna, Patrese, Capelli and Brundle. At the start, in torrential wet conditions, Patrese got by Senna and Schumacher while Alesi sensationally climbed up from eighth to third. The order was: Mansell, Patrese, Alesi, Schumacher, Senna and Capelli.

Brundle retired yet again after spinning off on the main straight with a clutch problem by lap 5, meaning it was his fourth consecutive retirement. Schumacher attacked and passed Alesi on lap 7. Senna tried to do the same but tipped Alesi into a spin, putting the Frenchman behind Berger and Capelli as well. By now the rain intensified, and Patrese spun off on lap 20 while trying to lap a backmarker. This put Mansell ahead of Schumacher, Senna, Berger, Capelli and Alesi. Maurício Gugelmin as the only Jordan in the race, and lapped by the McLarens, had spun into the pit wall at lap 25.

During the pit-stops, Alesi got past Capelli and began to charge up through the field. He cruised past Berger for fourth and began to attack Senna for third. He wanted to attack Schumacher as well and was in a hurry. The pressure was so intense that Senna spun off with two laps to go. At the same time, Capelli spun off as well. Mansell won again from Schumacher, Alesi, Berger, Alboreto and Pierluigi Martini.

===Race 5: San Marino===
At the San Marino Grand Prix at the Imola circuit in Italy, the Williamses were still well ahead of the McLarens and the Benettons, Mansell taking another pole ahead of Patrese, Senna, Berger, Schumacher and Brundle. At the start, Patrese attacked Mansell but Mansell kept the lead and Schumacher got ahead of Berger to take fourth. The order at the end of the first lap was: Mansell, Patrese, Senna, Schumacher, Berger and Brundle.

As usual, Mansell was pulling away from Patrese as the two of them began to pull away from the field. Capelli in the second Ferrari spun off into the gravel trap on lap 12. Schumacher was pressurizing Senna but it was he who made the mistake first, spinning out into retirement on lap 21 with the result of rear suspension damage after clipping the tyre wall. Alesi was planning to go without a stop and so after the others stopped, he had climbed up to third. However, he was soon under pressure from the McLarens of Senna and Berger. Senna went ahead at Tosa on lap 40, but Berger tried to follow him through and Alesi lost momentum and spun towards Berger, taking both out.

Mansell made it five wins out of five with Patrese making it one more Williams 1–2 ahead of Senna, Brundle, Alboreto and Martini.

===Race 6: Monaco===
In Monaco, the Williamses were again dominant, with Mansell taking six poles in six with Patrese beside him, Senna third, Alesi fourth, Berger fifth and Schumacher sixth. At the start, Senna got ahead of Patrese while Schumacher took Alesi and Berger into the first corner. However, Alesi took fourth back at Mirabeau and then the race settled down. The order was: Mansell, Senna, Patrese, Alesi, Schumacher and Berger.

Patrese began to attack Senna but then began to drop back with gearbox troubles. On lap 12, Schumacher tried to pass Alesi and the two collided, and an electronic box was damaged in Alesi&#x27;s car, with Schumacher getting ahead. Alesi continued to stay fifth for another 16 laps before the damage forced him to retire on lap 28. This promoted Berger to fifth, a place which he held for just under 5 laps before he had to retire from gearbox troubles.

On lap 60, Alboreto, just about to be lapped by Senna, spun in front of him and Senna lost another 10 seconds. Then, there was a loose wheelnut in Mansell&#x27;s car and Mansell had to pit and rejoined behind Senna. He closed the gap quickly but with overtaking being extremely hard, Senna was able to legally block every move that Mansell made. Senna won from Mansell, Patrese, Schumacher, Brundle and Bertrand Gachot.

===Race 7: Canada===
There was a change in Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Canada with Senna taking his 61st career pole position ahead of Patrese, Mansell, Berger, Schumacher and Herbert. At the start, Mansell got ahead of Patrese and behind them Brundle was able to get by Herbert. The order was: Senna, Mansell, Patrese, Berger, Schumacher and Brundle.

The race settled down for the first 14 laps but then on lap 15, Mansell attacked Senna at the final chicane and hit a kerb, pushing his car into the air. It landed nose-first into the gravel and spun back onto the track. Mansell claimed that Senna had pushed him off the track. He was out and this forced Patrese to slow down and suddenly Berger went through to second. Senna then began to pull away from the field and the stops changed nothing. Senna still led Berger, Patrese, Schumacher, Brundle and Herbert. Herbert went out on lap 34 with clutch troubles.

Senna lost a certain victory when electrical failure put him out on lap 38. Behind them, Brundle passed Schumacher for third and this became second when Patrese&#x27;s gearbox failed on lap 44. However, Brundle only lasted for two more laps before he retired with transmission trouble. Berger won from Schumacher, Alesi, Wendlinger, de Cesaris and Érik Comas.

===Race 8: France===
The Williamses took the front row at the Magny-Cours circuit in France ahead of the McLarens, with Mansell on pole ahead of Patrese, Senna, Berger, Schumacher and Alesi. At the start, Patrese got by Mansell while Berger got ahead of Senna and Brundle was able to pass Alesi. At the Adelaide hairpin, Schumacher tried to pass Senna but instead hit him, taking Senna out and forcing himself to pit. Meanwhile, Patrese and Mansell were side by side but Patrese kept the lead. Patrese led Mansell, Berger, Brundle, Alesi and Häkkinen and then Patrese waved Mansell through.

Nothing changed until lap 11 when Berger&#x27;s engine failed. Soon afterwards it began to rain so heavily that the race was stopped. After some time the rain decreased and the grid formed up again. Patrese took the lead again with Alesi getting ahead of Häkkinen as well. Mansell tried to get past but Patrese defended and once again kept the lead. Patrese led Mansell, Brundle, Alesi, Häkkinen and Comas on aggregate. Patrese then waved Mansell through on track and soon Mansell got ahead on aggregate.

It began to rain again and everyone pitted for wets with Alesi going too late and dropping down to sixth. His engine failed on lap 61. Mansell won with Patrese making it a Williams 1–2 ahead of Brundle, Häkkinen, Comas and Herbert.

Thus, at the halfway stage of the season, Mansell was comfortably leading the championship with 66 points compared to Patrese&#x27;s 34. Schumacher was third with 26, Senna was fourth with 18, Berger was fifth with 18, Alesi was sixth with 11, Brundle was seventh with 9 and Alboreto was eighth with 5. The 66 points that Mansell had after the French Grand Prix would have been enough for him to have been crowned world champion even if he had scored no further points in the season; Patrese was the eventual runner-up with 56 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams were dominant, with 100 points and well ahead of the field. McLaren were second with 36, Benetton were third with 35, and Ferrari were fourth with 13.

This Grand Prix saw, for the first time in the sport, the trialing of a safety car, in this case a Ford Escort RS Cosworth.

===Race 9: Great Britain===
Mansell took pole position at Silverstone in Britain with Patrese making another Williams 1–2 ahead of Senna, Schumacher, Berger and Brundle. At the start, Patrese got ahead of Mansell while Brundle had a superb start, blasting by the three in front of him, and Schumacher also got ahead of Senna. Patrese waved Mansell through on the Hangar straight with action behind as both Senna and Berger got ahead of Schumacher. Schumacher quickly recovered and passed Berger at Priory before the first lap was over. Mansell led Patrese, Brundle, Senna, Schumacher and Berger.

Herbert became the first of the leaders to retire from sixth position in the leading Lotus with transmission problems on lap 32. Alesi in the leading Ferrari eventually went off the track with mechanical problems by lap 44. Senna put Brundle under pressure but Brundle kept the place. The round of stops changed nothing, with Mansell leading from Patrese, Brundle, Senna, Schumacher and Berger. Schumacher then went wide at a corner giving fifth to Berger. Senna only lasted until lap 53 when his transmission failed. On the next lap, Schumacher passed Berger who was suffering from engine trouble, but still managed to cross the line just before it let go and finished fifth.

Mansell took the win with Patrese making it one more Williams 1–2 ahead of Brundle, Schumacher, Berger and Häkkinen. Spectators began to invade the track to celebrate his win even before the final lap had finished, and thousands entered the track following the chequered flag. The win saw Mansell overtake Jackie Stewart as the most successful British driver, with 28 wins to Stewart&#x27;s 27. Mansell&#x27;s record was subsequently overtaken by Lewis Hamilton.

This Grand Prix also saw repeated trials for a safety car, first run at the preceding French Grand Prix.

===Race 10: Germany===
At Hockenheim in Germany, the Williamses were again ahead of the McLarens, with Mansell on pole ahead of Patrese, Senna, Berger, Alesi and home hero Schumacher. At the start, Mansell defended from Patrese while Alesi lost out to both Schumacher and a fast-starting Brundle. Mansell was leading Patrese, Senna, Berger, Schumacher and Brundle at the end of the first lap.

Mansell then pulled away from Patrese who was doing the same to the McLarens. Soon the stops came and everyone in the top pitted except Senna and the Benettons were planning to go without a stop. Berger had a slow stop and retired with a misfire soon after. The order after the stops was: Senna, Mansell, Schumacher, Patrese, Brundle and Alesi.

Mansell did not want to stay second and passed Senna to lead with Patrese taking third from Schumacher soon after. Patrese was on a charge and smashed the lap record in his chase of Senna. He was right with Senna on the penultimate lap and tried to attack on the last lap. But Patrese in his attempt spun off into the gravel trap and was out. Mansell took his eighth win of the season ahead of Senna, Schumacher, Brundle, Alesi and Comas.

===Race 11: Hungary===
By the time the Hungarian Grand Prix in Mogyoród came around, Mansell was 46 points ahead of Patrese and the Williams team were 77 points ahead of Benetton with 6 races to go. This was the chance for Williams to seal both titles and they were dominant, but it was Patrese who took pole ahead of Mansell, Senna, Schumacher, Berger and Brundle. At the start, Berger got by Schumacher and then Mansell lost momentum and Senna passed him with Berger following his teammate through. The order was: Patrese, Senna, Berger, Mansell, Schumacher and Brundle.

There was a collision on the first lap between Comas, Herbert, Boutsen and Tarquini who all retired on the first lap (meaning both Ligiers of Comas and Boutsen retired on the first lap), before Van de Poole spun into retirement at the first corner on lap 3 as both Fondmetals retired after only 2 laps. Mansell passed Berger on lap 8 and set off after Senna. However, as hard as he tried, the combination of the small circuit and Senna&#x27;s skills in defending meant that he could not pass. Alesi in the leading Ferrari behind the leading pack spun out with the rear wheels in the gravel trap by lap 15. On lap 31, Patrese made a mistake and went wide and rejoined behind Berger. Two laps later, Mansell passed Berger to get back third. Then, a pivotal movement came on lap 39 when Patrese spun off. He rejoined in seventh, outside the points which meant that Mansell would be the world champion if results stayed the same. However, on lap 51, Mansell had to go to the pits with tyre troubles and rejoined in sixth, just ahead of Patrese. Mansell quickly passed Häkkinen but before Patrese, who was right behind, could take sixth, Patrese&#x27;s engine blew. He was out and would get no points.

Mansell quickly caught and passed Brundle on lap 60 and four laps later, he was up to third when Schumacher&#x27;s rear wing broke, spinning him out and retired on lap 64. Senna, a minute ahead, made a precautionary stop just as Häkkinen passed Brundle for fourth. Mansell passed Berger for second and now had a toehold on the championship. Soon afterwards, Häkkinen tried to pass Berger and spun into Brundle&#x27;s path. Brundle was forced to spin to avoid a collision and both rejoined without losing places, with Häkkinen staying ahead. Senna won ahead of new world champion Mansell, Berger, Häkkinen, Brundle and Capelli.

===Race 12: Belgium===
Now to Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium and champion-elect Mansell took pole ahead of Senna, Schumacher, Patrese, Alesi and Berger. At the start, it was damp and Senna outdragged Mansell with Patrese getting ahead of Schumacher while Berger did not move. Senna was leading Mansell, Patrese, Schumacher, Alesi and Thierry Boutsen.

At the start before La Source, Berger failed to get away and retired after an immediate transmission problem &amp; put him out straight away. Mansell attacked and passed Senna at the end of the second lap with Patrese following suit. Then it began to rain and almost everybody pitted for wets. Senna stayed out in the hope that the rain would stop but it did not. He pitted late and rejoined down in 12th as Alesi went out with a puncture after colliding with Mansell at La Source. The order was: Mansell, Patrese, Schumacher, Brundle, Häkkinen and Boutsen. Capelli suffered a dramatic engine failure on lap 26 as he went straight off into the gravel trap at Blanchimont whilst battling Herbert for sixth position. The track was beginning to dry and Boutsen spun off on lap 28. Schumacher lost two seconds after going off the track and stopped for dries at the end of the lap. However, Mansell and Patrese stayed out far too long and when both pitted late, they rejoined behind Schumacher. Herbert eventually retired yet again with engine problems on lap 43, the Englishman would be classified 13th.

Mansell tried to close in but cracked an exhaust and dropped back. Patrese suffered the same fate and had to hold back Brundle. Behind, the recovering Senna took fifth from Häkkinen. Schumacher took his maiden win ahead of Mansell, Patrese, Brundle, Senna and Häkkinen. The Constructors&#x27; Championship went to Williams after their 2–3 finish. This was also the only race to have 18 classified finishers, the highest number of finishers that year.

Thus, with three-quarters of the season over, Mansell was the World Champion with 98 points, with Patrese second with 44, Schumacher third with 43, Senna fourth with 36, Berger fifth with 24, Brundle sixth with 21, Alesi seventh with 13, and Häkkinen eighth with 9. Williams were the World Champion in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 142 points, with Benetton second with 64, McLaren third with 60, and Ferrari fourth with 16.

===Race 13: Italy===

At Monza in Italy, Mansell was on pole ahead of Senna, Alesi, Berger, Patrese and Schumacher. At the start, Mansell took off while Patrese got ahead of Alesi and Berger lost out to Schumacher, Capelli and Brundle. Mansell led Senna, Patrese, Alesi, Schumacher and Capelli.

Mansell pulled away fast with Senna holding up Patrese. On lap 13, both Ferraris went out: Alesi with trouble in his fuel system and Capelli with electrical problems. Patrese then passed Senna but Mansell was already 10 seconds up the road. Then, everybody stopped during which Brundle got ahead of Schumacher. The order was: Mansell, Patrese, Senna, Brundle, Schumacher and Berger. Then Mansell suddenly slowed down and allowed Patrese to pass him.

Then, on lap 36, he began to drop back with hydraulic troubles. Senna, Brundle, Schumacher and Berger all passed him. He trolled round and retired in the pits on lap 41. Patrese led but then Senna began to close in. Patrese also began to suffer from hydraulic troubles and Senna passed him on lap 49. On the next lap, both Brundle and Schumacher found a way through. Patrese held fourth until the last lap when Berger passed him. Senna won from Brundle, Schumacher, Berger, the hobbling Patrese and de Cesaris.

===Race 14: Portugal===
The Williamses were again ahead of the McLarens and the Benettons in Estoril just outside Lisbon with Mansell on pole ahead of Patrese, Senna, Berger, Schumacher and Brundle. At the start, Schumacher was late firing up and started at the back of the grid. At the start, Berger got ahead of Senna. Mansell led from Patrese, Berger, Senna, Brundle and Häkkinen.

Herbert in the second Lotus collided with Alesi on the first lap, Herbert eventually crashed out on lap 3 as Alesi in the leading Ferrari had spun off by lap 13, making it his 4th retirement in a row. Then it was the usual sight of Mansell pulling away from Patrese and the two getting away from the rest. The Williamses pitted early unlike the McLarens. Mansell had a quick stop and rejoined in the lead but Patrese had a problem with his right rear jack and joined behind the McLarens. He passed Senna quickly and set off after Berger. On lap 35, the recovering Schumacher took sixth from Alboreto. Soon after, Patrese was right with Berger, looking for a way through.

Berger realised that he had blistered his tyres and slowed down as he was about to go to the pits. Patrese was caught unawares, hit the back of Berger and had a massive crash. Luckily, Patrese was unhurt. Schumacher hit the debris and had to pit again, dropping back to eighth. Mansell took his 30th career win ahead of Berger, Senna, Brundle, Häkkinen and Alboreto.

With two more races to go, Mansell was already World Champion with 108 points but there was a big battle for second. Senna was second with 50, Schumacher was third with 47, Patrese was fourth with 46, Berger was fifth with 33, Brundle was sixth with 30, Alesi was seventh with 13, and Häkkinen was eighth with 11. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams was the World Champion with 154 points. McLaren was second with 83, Benetton was third with 77, and Ferrari was fourth with 16.

===Race 15: Japan===
Before the race at Suzuka in Japan, Ferrari had dropped Capelli who had a poor season and replaced him with Nicola Larini. In qualifying, the Williamses showed their class with Mansell taking pole ahead of Patrese, Senna, Berger, Schumacher and Herbert. At the start, there were no changes at the front and Mansell still led Patrese, Senna, Berger, Schumacher and Herbert.

Senna did not last long, going out with engine troubles on lap 3. Gouillard had crashed out in the second Tyrrell by lap 6. Berger decided to make an early stop and dropped back down to sixth. Schumacher had gearbox troubles and retired at the end of lap 13. Herbert now inherited third only to go out with the same problems two laps later. Berger and Brundle who stopped earlier did not stop when the others did and so the order after the stops was: Mansell, Patrese, Berger, Häkkinen, Brundle and Comas.

On lap 36, Mansell slowed down and let Patrese through before again speeding up and hanging on Patrese&#x27;s tail. However, on lap 45, an engine failure ended Mansell&#x27;s race. At the same time, Häkkinen went out with the same problem. Patrese won from Berger, Brundle, de Cesaris, Alesi and Christian Fittipaldi.

===Race 16: Australia===
For the season&#x27;s final race on the streets of Adelaide, Australia, Mansell took pole ahead of Senna, Patrese, Berger, Schumacher and Alesi. At the start, Alesi had to hold off Brundle and there were no changes ahead of him. The order was: Mansell, Senna, Patrese, Berger, Schumacher and Alesi.

There was a collision at the start behind the leaders as Grouillard&#x27;s Tyrrell collided with the Dallara of Martini on the first lap (eliminating both drivers on the same lap). However, Mansell did not pull away as usual. Senna was right with him and tried to pass him on lap 8. Gugelmin had once again spun out and crashed in the second Jordan by lap 9. He went wide and Mansell retained the lead. The top two were pulling away from Patrese and the rest but Senna could not attack Mansell. The gap stayed at less than a second. Then, on lap 19, entering the final corner, Senna crashed into the back of Mansell resulting in both drivers retiring. Some claimed that Mansell &#x27;brake tested&#x27; Senna.

Patrese was now leading under immense pressure from Berger. Berger tried to pass around the outside but he too went wide. While Patrese did not pit, Berger pitted, followed 5 laps later by Schumacher. Berger rejoined 4 seconds ahead. Behind them, Brundle had got ahead of Alesi in the stops. On lap 51, Patrese, nearly 20 seconds ahead, coasted to a halt with an engine failure. So, Berger won with Schumacher close behind ahead of Brundle, Alesi, Boutsen (the last time the Belgian would score points) and Stefano Modena, this race was remembered for being Modena&#x27;s last Grand Prix and the only point for the Jordan team that season.

===Season result===
At the end of the season, Mansell was named world champion with 108 points with Patrese edging out the battle for second with 56, Schumacher third with 53, Senna fourth with 50, Berger fifth with 49, Brundle sixth with 38, Alesi seventh with 18 and Häkkinen eighth with 11. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams was dominant champion with 164 points, McLaren just edging out second with 99, Benetton a close third with 91, and Ferrari fourth with 21.

<text>The 1991 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 45th season of FIA Formula One motor racing and the 42nd season of the Formula One World Championship. It featured the 1991 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1991 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 10 March and ended on 3 November.

Ayrton Senna won his third and last Drivers&#x27; Championship, and McLaren-Honda won their fourth consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship. Senna won seven of the sixteen races; his main challenger for the title was Nigel Mansell, who won five races in his first season back at Williams. Alain Prost failed to win a race with Ferrari and was fired before the end of the season due to a dispute with the team. 1991 also saw the debuts of future world champions Michael Schumacher and Mika Häkkinen, as well as the retirement of three-time champion Nelson Piquet.

, this is the last World Championship season to be won by a Brazilian racing driver. It was the last drivers&#x27; title won using a Honda-powered car until Max Verstappen in 2021 and the last constructors&#x27; title won by a Honda-powered car until the Red Bull Racing RB19 in 2023.

This season was the last time an F1 car with a manual gearbox won the championship, and the only V12-powered car to do so. It was also Pirelli&#x27;s last season as Formula One&#x27;s tyre supplier until .

Eddie Jordan paid $150,000 to Mercedes-Benz, since the German was under contract with their sports cars team. He outqualified veteran Andrea de Cesaris and moved up to the Benetton team just one race later.
* Benetton&#x27;s driver Roberto Moreno was paid off to make room, but was offered Schumacher&#x27;s seat at Jordan. However, he was replaced after two races by rising F3000 star Alessandro Zanardi. He ended the season at Minardi, to fill in for Gianni Morbidelli.
* Morbidelli&#x27;s services were required by Ferrari at the Australian Grand Prix after they fired Alain Prost.

==Race-by-race==

===Race 1: USA===

The season started off at the Phoenix street circuit that had a modified layout to make it more of a challenge to drivers. Senna took pole ahead of Prost, Patrese, Mansell, Piquet and Alesi. At the start, Senna and Prost maintained their places while Mansell sliced ahead of Patrese and Piquet lost out to Alesi and Berger. The order at the end of lap 1 was: Senna, Prost, Mansell, Patrese, Alesi and Berger.

Early on, as Senna was pulling away from Prost, Alesi got past Patrese for fourth. However, Patrese repassed him on lap 16 and closed up on Mansell. He attacked on lap 22 but shot into an escape road and rejoined behind Alesi and Berger. He quickly closed up on them with Berger attacking Alesi but unable to pass. Patrese passed Berger on lap 34. On the next lap, Mansell&#x27;s gearbox failed and soon afterward, on lap 36, Berger had fuel pump trouble, which forced him to retire. Patrese then passed Alesi who pitted on lap 43. He closed in on Prost and the Ferrari pitted on lap 46, with right rear troubles putting him down to seventh.

Patrese didn&#x27;t last much longer, his gearbox failing and then the stationary car was hit by Roberto Moreno, forcing both of them out. Piquet, who did not stop, was passed by Alesi for second with Prost taking fourth off Stefano Modena soon after. Alesi was having gearbox troubles and was holding back Piquet as Prost began to attack both of them. On lap 70, Piquet passed Alesi and Prost followed him through. Prost then shifted sides getting ahead of Piquet as well. Modena passed Alesi for fourth and Alesi soon retired with gearbox troubles. Unflustered by all this, Senna won from Prost, Piquet, Modena, Satoru Nakajima and Aguri Suzuki. This would be the last Formula One Grand Prix on the streets of downtown Phoenix, Arizona and the last Formula One race in the United States for 9 years; Formula One would return to a very different part of the United States in 2000 – the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway, that had a whole new road course built within the facility just for the Grand Prix.

===Race 2: Brazil===

The field traveled to Brazil and Senna pleased his fans at the Interlagos circuit in his home city of São Paulo by taking pole at his home track ahead of the two Williams cars of Patrese and Mansell who were in front of Berger, Alesi and Prost. At the start, Senna took off and Mansell got by Patrese while Alesi got by Berger and Piquet got ahead of Prost. The order was: Senna, Mansell, Patrese, Alesi, Berger and Piquet.

Mansell began to attack Senna but could not pass. Senna then slowly pulled away from Mansell who had a slow pit stop on lap 22. He stayed second after the stops but 7 seconds behind Senna, the major change as a result of the stops was that Piquet who did not stop was third and that Berger and Prost had got by Alesi.

Berger blasted past Piquet soon afterward as Mansell began to catch Senna. Mansell was closing in but had to stop on lap 50 with a puncture. He charged back towards Senna who was experiencing gearbox troubles. However, it was Mansell&#x27;s gearbox which ironically gave way on lap 60. Patrese was having the same problem but still running in second and Berger was having trouble with a sticking throttle. It began to rain and Prost passed Piquet for fourth. The top three struggled with the wet conditions; especially Senna, who had gearbox trouble and only had 6th gear. Senna won followed by Patrese, Berger, Prost, Piquet and Alesi.

===Race 3: San Marino===

At Imola, Senna took his 55th pole position ahead of Patrese, Prost, Mansell, Berger and Modena. It rained as they were approaching the start and Prost spun off on the parade lap and was out. At the start, Patrese got ahead of Senna while Mansell had gearbox problems and retired after being hit by Martin Brundle&#x27;s Brabham. The order was: Patrese, Senna, Berger, Modena, Alesi and Nakajima.

Patrese pulled away but pitted on lap 10 with a misfire and rejoined several laps down. On lap 16, Nakajima retired from fourth with transmission failure. After the stops, Senna stayed ahead of Berger while Moreno got fourth from Pierluigi Martini. Soon afterward JJ Lehto passed Martini to take fifth. At the front, the gap between Senna and Berger was stable. Modena retired on lap 42 with transmission troubles, promoting Moreno to third which he held only for eight laps when Lehto passed him. On lap 52, Moreno retired with an engine failure. On the last lap, Eric van de Poele was set for a 5th-place finish but retired with a fuel pump problem. At the front, Senna won ahead of Berger, Lehto, Martini, Mika Häkkinen and Julian Bailey.

===Race 4: Monaco===

Senna took another pole in Monaco with Modena a surprising second ahead of Patrese, Piquet, Mansell and Berger. At the start, Berger hit Piquet and Piquet was out while Berger dropped to the back. The order was: Senna, Modena, Patrese, Mansell, Prost and Moreno.

With overtaking hard on the Monaco streets, there were no changes until Prost got past Mansell on lap 30. By now, Senna was over 10 seconds ahead of Modena, who was holding up Patrese. Soon afterward, Alesi passed Moreno for fourth and pulled away. Meanwhile, Nakajima in the other Tyrrell further down had spun off the track after making contact with Martini&#x27;s Minardi on lap 35. On lap 43, Modena&#x27;s engine blew in the tunnel and this blocked Patrese, who spun off into the wall and both were out, as ironically Alboreto well down in the Footwork had also retired with a blown Porsche engine in the Footwork leaving additional oil on the track at the Nouvelle chicane which later left Blundell&#x27;s Brabham to spin off into the wall out of 10th place behind the leaders by lap 44 just after overtaking Bernard before he crashed.

Mansell was putting pressure on Prost, who had trouble with a loose wheel, and made a daring move through the chicane on lap 63 to take second and then really started flying with fastest lap after fastest lap before Prost eventually set the fastest lap on lap 77 (14 laps after his pit-stop as he was a lap down in 5th place). Soon afterward, Prost was forced to stop to change the wheel and dropped down to fifth. Senna took his fourth win in four ahead of Mansell, Alesi, Moreno, Prost and Emanuele Pirro.

===Race 5: Canada===

At the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, the Williams cars were 1–2 in qualifying, Patrese on pole ahead of Mansell, Senna, Prost, Moreno and Berger. At the start, Mansell got ahead of Patrese while Berger slipped past Moreno. It was Mansell leading from Patrese, Senna, Prost, Berger and Moreno. On lap 5, Berger retired with battery troubles but Moreno could take fifth only for 5 more laps before he spun off into retirement.

Mansell and Patrese were pulling away from Senna while there was a battle for fourth between Prost, Alesi and Piquet. On lap 26, Senna retired with alternator troubles and two laps later Prost was out with a failed gearbox. Alesi was third but on lap 35, his engine expired. This put Mansell in front of Patrese, Piquet, Modena, Andrea de Cesaris and Ivan Capelli. Patrese had to pit with a puncture and rejoined behind Piquet. He then had gearbox troubles and was passed by Modena as Capelli spun off.

On the last lap, Mansell waved to the crowd, and then he let his car&#x27;s revs drop too low and stalled the Renault engine. This left a delighted Piquet to take his last career win ahead of Modena, Patrese, de Cesaris, Bertrand Gachot and Mansell who was classified sixth.

===Race 6: Mexico===

The extremely bumpy Hermanos Rodriguez Autodrome in Mexico saw a number of incidents during practice, including Senna crashing at the very fast Peraltada while trying to take it a bit faster than usual and his car overturned when it hit the tire barrier. Senna had come to Mexico City with a head injury that he got while jetskiing in Brazil, and had been critical of the dusty circuit&#x27;s condition all through the weekend. Williams took 1–2 in qualifying with Patrese ahead of Mansell, Senna, Alesi, Berger and Piquet. Patrese made a poor start and lost three places while Alesi dived ahead of Senna. The order was: Mansell, Alesi, Senna, Patrese, Berger and Piquet. There was action as Senna passed Alesi with Patrese following him through and then Modena getting by Piquet.

Berger&#x27;s engine failed on lap 6 and soon afterwards Patrese passed Senna and set off after Mansell. Modena then began to drop back. Patrese passed Mansell and then both Senna and Alesi had a go at the Englishman with Alesi spinning and dropping back to seventh. Patrese then began to pull away from Mansell who was holding up Senna. Meanwhile, Alesi passed Moreno and then de Cesaris as Mansell pulled away from Senna. He closed the gap to Patrese to 1.2 seconds before Patrese increased his pace and made the gap stable.

Alesi&#x27;s clutch failed on lap 43 and Piquet had wheel bearing troubles two laps later and thus Gachot was fifth. He held it until he spun off on lap 52. At the front, Patrese won with Mansell making it a Williams 1–2 ahead of Senna, de Cesaris, Moreno and Éric Bernard.

===Race 7: France===

The French Grand Prix had moved from the Paul Ricard circuit near Marseille in southern France to the new Magny-Cours circuit in central France. Patrese took another pole ahead of home hero Prost, Senna, Mansell, Berger and Alesi. At the start, Patrese had problems selecting his gear, and when he did start his car, he was engulfed by the field. This blocked Senna allowing Mansell to get ahead of him. The order was: Prost, Mansell, Senna, Berger, Alesi and Piquet.

On lap 6, Berger retired with yet another engine failure. Two laps later, there was trouble as Piquet lost places as Gianni Morbidelli tried to pass him and hit Capelli, taking both out while Piquet lost time and places. At the front, Mansell attacked Prost and passed him on lap 22. At the stops, Mansell had a slow one and Prost was back in the lead. Senna was under pressure from Alesi but holding him at bay, over 15 seconds behind the leaders.

Meanwhile, Mansell again began to close in on Prost and as the two wound through traffic on lap 54, Mansell made a superb move on the outside of the Adelaide hairpin to lead and then slowly pulled away. Mansell won from Prost, Senna, Alesi, the recovering Patrese and de Cesaris.

===Race 8: United Kingdom===

The Silverstone circuit had been heavily modified; it was no longer the simplistic, ultra-fast circuit it had been since its inception; it was now more of a technical circuit, but it was still relatively fast. Mansell took pole position ahead of Senna, Patrese, Berger, Prost and Alesi. At the start, Senna took the lead from Mansell while Berger hit Patrese, spinning Patrese out while Berger dropped down the order, behind Prost, Alesi and Moreno. At the front, Mansell turned off the rev-limiter to accelerate past Senna into the Hangar straight. Thus Mansell led from Senna, Alesi, Prost, Moreno and Berger.

Soon Berger passed Moreno for fifth and this became fourth when Prost spun, dropping two places. Moreno then retired with gearbox troubles. At the front, the gap between Mansell and Senna was around 4–5 seconds with Alesi third, a long way back. However, when he was trying to lap Suzuki, he hit Suzuki, taking both out. After the stops, Mansell stayed 10 seconds ahead of Senna with Berger a long way back but 20 seconds ahead of Prost.

Senna decided to try with a light fuel load to attack Mansell. He closed the gap to 7 seconds but because of that, he ran out of fuel on the last lap, which gave Mansell the opportunity to pick up the stranded Brazilian on his victory lap and drive him back to pit lane. Therefore, Mansell won ahead of Berger, Prost, Senna (classified fourth for starting final lap), Piquet and Gachot.

At the halfway stage of the season, Senna led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 51 points, with Mansell second with 33, Patrese third with 22, and Prost fourth with 21. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren led with 67 points, Williams close in second with 55, Ferrari third with 29, and Benetton fourth with 23.

===Race 9: Germany===
At the halfway point of the season, pre-qualifying was re-arranged. Dallara, Jordan and &#x27;Lambo&#x27; escaped, while AGS, Footwork and Brabham needed to pre-qualify for rest of the season.

The second half of the year started at the very fast forested Hockenheim circuit in Germany and Mansell continued where he left off, taking pole ahead of Senna, Berger, Patrese, Prost and Alesi. At the start, Mansell took off while Berger got by Senna and Patrese again had a poor start, dropping behind the Ferraris. At the end of the first lap, Mansell led from Berger, Senna, Prost, Alesi and Patrese.

Patrese quickly got ahead of Alesi as the order settled down. Alesi decided to go without a stop while the rest pitted. However, Berger had some trouble in the stops and dropped back to 10th. Thus, the order was Alesi leading Mansell, Senna, Prost, Patrese and de Cesaris. Mansell quickly passed Alesi to lead and then pulled away. Prost and Senna were battling for third and Prost went wide at a corner trying to pass Senna allowing Patrese to take fourth.

Patrese quickly passed Senna to leave him with a frustrated Prost. Prost tried to pass him on lap 38 but Senna did not give him enough room and Prost spun off and retired. Meanwhile, Patrese had closed right in on Alesi and passed him on lap 39. On the last lap, Senna ran out of fuel again. No one, however could touch Mansell who won, with Patrese making it a Williams 1–2 ahead of Alesi, the recovering Berger, de Cesaris and Gachot.

===Race 10: Hungary===

Senna took pole at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród, Hungary ahead of Patrese, Mansell, Prost, Berger and Alesi. At the start, Patrese got away better than Senna but Senna moved over to block him. Mansell was forced to defend third from Prost and kept the place. The order was: Senna, Patrese, Mansell, Prost, Berger and Alesi.

The top four stayed together and there was no way one could overtake the other on the twisting Hungaroring circuit. They pulled away from Berger who had a gap to Alesi. Prost&#x27;s engine blew on lap 28, reducing the battle at the front to three. The pit stops changed nothing but after them Mansell began to hound his teammate Patrese for second. Patrese let him get past to see what Mansell can do about Senna but he realised that the answer was nothing. Senna was continuing to slowly edge away. A dull race was won by Senna ahead of Mansell, Patrese, Berger, Alesi and Capelli.

===Race 11: Belgium===

Belgian driver Bertrand Gachot missed his home Grand Prix due to being imprisoned in Britain following an incident in which he sprayed tear gas at a London taxi driver. His Jordan seat was filled by then-unknown German driver Michael Schumacher.

At the popular and scenic Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, Senna took pole ahead of Patrese, Prost, Mansell, Berger, Alesi, Piquet and the new sensation, Schumacher. (After Saturday qualifying, Patrese&#x27;s car was found to not comply with safety regulations and Patrese&#x27;s Saturday times were wiped out, thus starting 17th). At the start, Senna defended from Prost while Piquet and Schumacher got past Alesi. However, Schumacher slowed with a clutch problem on the run down to Eau Rouge and retired. At the front, Senna led from Prost, Mansell, Berger, Piquet and Alesi. On lap 3, Prost had fuel leaking out of his car and retired.

Mansell began to attack Senna and after the stops got ahead of him. There was trouble when Berger spun after his stop and lost a lot of time. After the stops, Mansell led Alesi (who planned to go without stopping), Senna, Piquet, a recovering Patrese and de Cesaris. Then on lap 22, Mansell slowed to a halt with an electrical failure, giving Alesi the lead of the race. Senna&#x27;s engine then stopped for some time and because of that Piquet, Patrese and de Cesaris were right with him and allowing Alesi to remain in the lead. Senna was unable to pull away because he had gearbox troubles. On lap 31 — still intending to run non-stop — Alesi&#x27;s engine blew up and Senna was back in the lead. Patrese tried to pass Piquet but went wide and de Cesaris was able to take third.

He then passed Piquet to take second, with Patrese following him through soon after. Piquet began to drop back and Berger passed him. Patrese had gearbox troubles and was suddenly behind Berger and Piquet. On lap 41, de Cesaris, around 2 seconds behind Senna retired when his engine expired. Moreno passed the struggling Patrese on the next lap. Senna won with Berger making it a McLaren 1–2 ahead of Piquet, Moreno, Patrese and Mark Blundell.

===Race 12: Italy===

There was controversy before the Italian Grand Prix at the Monza Autodrome near Milan as Schumacher signed a deal with Benetton which displeased Jordan who went to court. The court decided in favour of Benetton with Schumacher and Moreno swapping teams. Bernie Ecclestone assisted both teams by supplying payments to Moreno and the Jordan team.
In qualifying, Senna took pole ahead of Mansell, Berger, Patrese, Prost and Alesi. At the start, Alesi steamed by Prost and hit Patrese into the first chicane and had to pit for repairs. Senna led Mansell, Berger, Patrese, Prost and Schumacher at the end of the first lap.

Patrese began to charge, passing Berger on lap 7. As Mansell was having difficulty finding a way around Senna, he put out his hand and waved Patrese ahead of him. He then attacked Senna and took the lead on lap 26. However, on the next lap, Patrese spun and he could not select full gears then. He went to the pits and retired. At the same time, Prost passed Berger to take third. Mansell now began to hound Senna and went all directions to get ahead.

He finally did it on lap 34 and Senna came into the pits for tyres. When he rejoined, the order was Mansell, Prost, Berger, Schumacher, Senna and de Cesaris. Senna was on a charge, passing Schumacher immediately after his stop. Berger then waved him through to see if he could attack Prost. Behind them, on lap 45, Piquet passed de Cesaris for sixth. Senna got ahead of Prost on the second chicane with seven laps remaining. Mansell won from Senna, Prost, Berger, Schumacher and Piquet.

With four races remaining, Senna held an 18-point lead over Mansell in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 77 to 59. Patrese was third with 34, followed by Berger with 31, and Prost with 25. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren led Williams by 15 points, 108 to 93, with Ferrari a distant third with 39.

===Race 13: Portugal===

The Estoril circuit near Lisbon hosted the Portuguese round, and Patrese took pole ahead of Berger, Senna, Mansell, Prost and Alesi. At the start, Mansell sliced across in front of Senna and switched sides to sneak by Berger. The order at the end of lap 1 was: Patrese, Mansell, Berger, Senna, Alesi and Prost.

The Williamses pulled away from the McLarens who were pulling away from the Ferraris (Prost had by now passed Alesi). On lap 18, Patrese waved Mansell through and decided to follow him. The McLarens stopped first and Senna got ahead of Berger. When Mansell stopped on lap 29, his crew had trouble fixing the wheelnut of his right rear properly. As the Williams mechanic went to get a spare nut, the lollipop man, unaware of the trouble signalled for Mansell to depart. Immediately, his right rear fell off and he stopped in the middle of the pitlane. The team retrieved the tyre, fixed it on Mansell&#x27;s car and sent him on his way but he had dropped to 17th.

At the front, Berger passed Senna and set off after Patrese only for his engine to fail on lap 38. Two laps later, Prost from third went out with the same problem. This put the order as: Patrese, Senna, Alesi, Martini, Capelli and Piquet. On lap 49, Mansell who had charged through the field took sixth from his former arch-rival Piquet and was only 15 seconds from third place. Then, on lap 51, he was shown the black disqualification flag for the pit-lane infringement. Capelli spun off on lap 65 from fifth. Patrese won from Senna, Alesi, Martini, Piquet and Schumacher.

===Race 14: Spain===

The Spanish Grand Prix had moved from the Jerez circuit near Seville to the brand-new Catalunya circuit in Montmeló, on the other side of Spain. Berger took pole in Spain ahead of Mansell, Senna, Patrese, Schumacher and Prost. At the start, it was damp and Senna blasted past Mansell while Patrese messed up again, dropping to sixth. Midway through the lap, Schumacher passed Mansell to take third. The order was: Berger, Senna, Schumacher, Mansell, Prost and Patrese.

Mansell repassed Schumacher near the end of the second lap and set off after Senna. On lap 5, Mansell and Senna went side by side down the main straight but Mansell was ahead as he had the inside line. As the track dried, everyone stopped and Berger&#x27;s stop was slow. Senna&#x27;s stop was quick and he took the lead ahead of Berger, Mansell, Prost, Schumacher and Patrese. Senna then let Berger through on lap 12 in order to hold up Mansell while Schumacher overtook Prost at the same time. Then, Senna spun into the last corner and dropped behind Mansell, Schumacher and Prost.

Mansell quickly reeled in Berger and got ahead on lap 20 and proceeded to pull away. Schumacher now came to attack Berger and when he tried, he messed up and spun off. He rejoined back down in sixth. On lap 33, Berger slowed down with electrical troubles and retired. Soon afterwards, Patrese passed Senna for third. Schumacher had blistered his tyres in the spin and pitted, dropping behind Alesi who charged forward and passed Senna. Mansell crucially won from Prost, Patrese, Alesi, Senna and Schumacher.

With two races to go, Senna led Mansell by 16 points in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 85 to 69, with only a maximum of 20 points still available. Patrese was third with 48, while Prost and Berger both had 31. The Constructors&#x27; Championship was much closer with Williams leading McLaren by one point, 117 to 116, while Ferrari was third with 52.

===Race 15: Japan===
At the challenging Suzuka circuit in Japan, the McLarens took 1–2 in qualifying with Berger ahead of Senna, Mansell, Prost, Patrese and Alesi. At the start, Berger got away well and Senna blocked Mansell while behind them Patrese got by Prost. Alesi did not last long, his engine failing even before finishing the lap. The order was: Berger, Senna, Mansell, Patrese, Prost and Martini.

Senna let Berger pull away and then held up Mansell, who had to win to keep his World Championship hopes alive. Mansell was frustrated at seeing Berger pull away and hounded Senna in the hope that Senna would make a mistake. However, it was Mansell who made a mistake first, spinning off in a cloud of smoke at the start of lap 10 as he was having brake problems. He was out and Senna was World Champion for the third time.

The McLaren team told Berger to let Senna through and thus protect him with the promise that Senna will let him back ahead on the last lap if they stay 1–2. There were no changes after the stops and the order stayed as: Senna, Berger, Patrese, Prost, Martini and Schumacher. At the front, Senna and Berger traded fastest laps. On lap 29, well behind Schumacher passed Martini for fifth. Nakajima in the second Tyrrell spun off at the S Curves and hit the tyre barrier in the gravel trap by lap 31 (Nakajima was unhurt). However, Schumacher&#x27;s engine failed on lap 35, giving the place back to Martini. Martini only held it for five more laps before his clutch failed, forcing him to retire.

Nothing then changed afterwards, and Senna kept McLaren&#x27;s agreement with Berger, by letting Berger through to win on the last lap. Berger won ahead of the successfully defending world champion Senna, Patrese, Prost, Martin Brundle and Modena. The McLaren Honda 1–2 also meant that they were now 11 points ahead of Williams Renault and had a grip on the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

===Race 16: Australia===
Before the final race at the street circuit in Adelaide, Australia, Prost was fired from the Ferrari team because he made some scathing comments about the team and described his car as a &#x27;truck&#x27; when his shock absorbers failed, and the Ferrari team as unwilling to work with him during a press conference for the Japanese Grand Prix. He was replaced by Ferrari test driver Gianni Morbidelli (who had been driving for Minardi). Although the Drivers&#x27; Championship had already been decided, the Constructors&#x27; Championship had not – this was still being disputed by the McLaren and Williams teams.

In qualifying, McLaren took 1–2 ahead of the Williamses and the Benettons with Senna ahead of Berger, Mansell, Patrese, Piquet, and Schumacher. At the start, in extremely torrential wet conditions, Patrese lost time and was quickly behind Piquet and Alesi had also got by him and Schumacher. Senna led from Berger, Mansell, Piquet, Alesi and Patrese. On lap 3, Berger went wide allowing Mansell to be second and thus go after Senna. He was close enough on lap 5 and was side by side with Senna on the next lap but saw yellow flags because of Nicola Larini&#x27;s crash. Thus he was forced to back off and Senna retained the lead. Alesi spun off immediately and was followed there by Schumacher. Both were out.

Then, on lap 8, Pierluigi Martini spun off into the wall and his front wing, which separated from his car, was hit by Patrese and got stuck in Patrese&#x27;s undertray. At the front, Mansell was no longer attacking Senna but Senna was unable to pull away. The conditions became better but after another seven laps, the weather started to become worse and more drivers began to spin off, including Mansell who smashed into a wall- which allowed McLaren to win the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Berger also spun off twice on the next lap as Senna gestured to the marshals to try to get the race stopped. Patrese followed suit and finally it was stopped after Senna had finished lap 16. However, the officials had decided to count the results back 2 laps to lap 14 which meant that Senna won from Mansell, Berger, Piquet, Patrese and Morbidelli. Only half points were awarded because the race was stopped before 75% of the distance was over. This particular Grand Prix set a record as the shortest Grand Prix ever run until the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa which only lasted 3 laps, all behind the safety car on 29 August 2021.

Because only half points were awarded in Australia, at the end of the season, Senna was the world champion with 96 points with Mansell second with 72, Patrese third with 53, Berger fourth with 43, Prost fifth with 34, Piquet sixth with 26.5, Alesi seventh with 21 and Modena eighth with 10. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren-Honda was the World Champion with 139 points, with Williams-Renault second with 125, Ferrari third with 55.5, and Benetton-Ford fourth with 38.5.

The 1991 season was to be the last in which Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet competed together, the four drivers having between them won 93 of the 112 Grands Prix since 1985 and all seven Drivers&#x27; Championships during this period. Piquet retired from F1 at season&#x27;s end, while Prost decided to take a sabbatical in 1992. Mansell would win the Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1992 and then leave F1 for CART; Prost would win the championship in 1993 and then retire; and Senna would lose his life at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

<text>The 1990 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 44th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1990 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1990 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 11 March and ended on 4 November. Ayrton Senna won the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the second time, and McLaren-Honda won their third consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship.

The championship featured a dramatic battle between Senna and former teammate Alain Prost, who had made the switch to Ferrari. Prost mounted Ferrari&#x27;s first title challenge for several years, and led the championship after three consecutive mid-season wins. Senna fought back strongly and went into the penultimate round at the Suzuka circuit in Japan with a nine-point lead over Prost. There, Senna took pole position only for Prost to beat him off the line; the Brazilian driver then drove into the Frenchman at the first corner, putting both out and thus settling the championship in Senna&#x27;s favour. This was the second year in succession that the two drivers had collided at Suzuka. Senna admitted the following year that the collision was deliberate, as he was furious that Prost had been able to start on the clean side of the grid and had decided that he was not going to allow the Frenchman to &#x27;make the corner&#x27; should he lose the start.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1990 FIA Formula One World Championship.

===Team changes===
* The teams Rial and Zakspeed left Formula One after the season.
* March&#x27;s main sponsor Leyton House completed their takeover of the team and officially registered as a new constructor.
* Life entered the sport, trying to market their unconventional W12 engine.
* Lotus took on Lamborghini as their engine supplier.
* Coloni struck a deal with Subaru and sold 51% of its shares to the Japanese car manufacturer.

====Mid-season changes====
* Faced with disappointing results in the first six races of the year, highly regarded designer Adrian Newey was fired from the Leyton House team.
* The Subaru flat-12 engine supplied to Coloni was not producing more than and the chassis was overweight by some . Good results stayed away and Subaru withdrew their ownership. By the German Grand Prix, Coloni had arranged a supply of Ford-Cosworth engines.
* The Life W12 engine was equally unsuccessful and the team switched to a Judd V8 engine before the Portuguese Grand Prix.
* Onyx folded after ten races, and EuroBrun and Life after fourteen of the sixteen races.

===Driver changes===
* Nine drivers had left the grid, compared to the last race of the season, amongst them were Eddie Cheever, embarking on a successful career in IndyCar racing, and René Arnoux, who retired.
* Alain Prost moved to Ferrari as a result of his stressful rivalry with his teammate Ayrton Senna and an overall unhappy year at McLaren, despite winning the 1989 championship. Gerhard Berger moved to McLaren to complete the switch.
* Triple world champion Nelson Piquet moved away from Lotus, having endured two disappointing seasons and getting the news of the new Lamborghini supply contract. Piquet&#x27;s contract turned out to be incentive-based: he would be paid US$100,000 for every point scored, though he was also paid a season retainer. The other Lotus driver, Satoru Nakajima, moved to Tyrrell over the winter, replacing Jonathan Palmer, who was signed as McLaren&#x27;s test driver. Lotus attracted Derek Warwick from Arrows and promoted their test driver Martin Donnelly.
* Three drivers made their debuts at the start of the season: Paolo Barilla at Minardi, Claudio Langes at EuroBrun and Gary Brabham at Life. Gianni Morbidelli became the fourth when he was needed as a stand-in (see &quot;Mid-season changes&quot;).

Another eight driver switches had happened over the winter, within the lower-ranking teams.

====Mid-season changes====
* Due to a pre-season cycling accident, Alex Caffi was forced to sit out the opening race, with Bernd Schneider filling the gap.
* Gary Brabham quit the Life team when seeing that no improvement in form was to be expected. Bruno Giacomelli took his place, having last raced in F1 in .
* Gary&#x27;s brother David Brabham signed with Brabham, the team owned by their father and triple world champion Jack Brabham. However, he requested to skip the first two races to prepare himself. Gregor Foitek stood in for him. Then, without missing a race, Foitek moved over to Onyx, after driver Stefan Johansson had fallen out with new team owner Peter Monteverdi.
* Gianni Morbidelli stood in for Emanuele Pirro at Scuderia Italia for the first two races of the season. He also replaced Paolo Barilla at Minardi for the final two races, and stayed with the team until the end of .
* Lotus&#x27;s test driver Johnny Herbert stepped up to the racing seat after Donnelly suffered a career-ending crash in the Spanish Grand Prix.
* When EuroBrun folded, Roberto Moreno found a new home in Benetton, after their driver Alessandro Nannini was involved in a helicopter crash. Moreno drove two races in 1990 and stayed with the team over the next year.

==Calendar==
===Calendar change===
The United States Grand Prix was moved from June to March to become the first round.

The Brazilian Grand Prix was returned to the Interlagos Circuit for the first time since 1980, with a shorter track layout after a major renovation of the facility.

The Canadian Grand Prix was moved to be before the Mexican Grand Prix.

==Regulation changes==
Three regulation changes occurred before the 1990 season, all from the aspect of driver safety:

===Technical regulations===
* Larger rear-view mirrors
* Quick-release steering wheel mandatory

===Sporting and event regulations===
* All marshals and medical staff must practice driver extrication exercises.

==Season report==

===Race 1: USA===

The first race of the year was held on an angular street circuit in Phoenix, Arizona, USA; the race became the season opener so it could be held in cooler and much more pleasant weather, avoiding the degree heat that made conditions very difficult at the previous race in Phoenix, which took place in June 1989. Unexpected rain in qualifying led to a grid with Gerhard Berger on pole position with Pierluigi Martini second in the Minardi, Andrea de Cesaris third in the Dallara, Jean Alesi fourth in the Tyrrell, Ayrton Senna down in fifth and Nelson Piquet sixth. Alesi took the lead at the start ahead of Berger, de Cesaris, Senna, Martini and Piquet.

Alesi pulled away and Berger was dropping back Senna passed de Cesaris. Berger hit a wall on lap 9 forcing him to pit. He charged back but later retired with clutch problems. Alesi was 8.2 seconds ahead but Senna started to reel him in. Senna attacked on lap 34 but Alesi defended and kept the lead. Senna overtook Alesi one lap later and pulled away to win. Both Ferraris retired with Alain Prost retiring on lap 21 with an oil leak and Nigel Mansell on lap 49 with clutch problems. After that, Thierry Boutsen passed Piquet to take third with Stefano Modena&#x27;s Brabham and Satoru Nakajima&#x27;s Tyrrell getting the final points.

===Race 2: Brazil===

The Brazilian Grand Prix had returned to the Interlagos Autodrome in São Paulo for the first time since 1980, having been at the Jacarepagua Riocentro Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro for 9 previous seasons consecutively, and 1978. The circuit had been shortened from 4.9 mi (7.9 km) to 2.6 mi (4.2 km).

During qualifying, Senna and Berger were 1–2 with Boutsen and Patrese 3–4 and the Ferraris of Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost behind them. At the start, Senna led Berger, Boutsen, Prost, Patrese and Mansell. Boutsen passed Berger early on but could not keep up with Senna.

At the stops, Boutsen ran into a tyre and had to change his nose cone, dropping back to 11th and some good work from the Ferrari crew got Prost ahead of Berger and Mansell ahead of Patrese. Senna was ahead of Prost, Berger, Mansell, Patrese and Alesi. Senna, 10 seconds ahead of everybody hit the backmarker, former teammate Nakajima, forcing him to pit and drop back to third. With just a few laps to go, Patrese retired with a broken oil cooler. Prost won from Berger, Senna, Mansell, the recovering Boutsen and Piquet.

===Race 3: San Marino===

There was a six-week gap before the San Marino round, at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari near Bologna in Italy; a number of changes were made to most of the cars during this period. An almost identical grid to Brazil saw Senna, Berger, Patrese, Boutsen, Mansell and Prost line up after qualifying. At the start, Senna and Berger got away well but Boutsen sliced ahead of Patrese to take third with Mansell and Prost behind. Boutsen passed Berger on lap 2. On the next lap, a stone sliced through Senna&#x27;s wheelrim, spinning him into a sand trap and out of the race. Boutsen pulled away from Berger but his engine blew on lap 18.

Soon Mansell passed Patrese and then attacked Berger. Berger closed the door and Mansell spun without hitting anything nor losing a place. He set off after Berger again but retired with engine problems. At the second stops, Nannini got ahead of Prost. Patrese closed in on Berger and passed him on lap 51. Patrese pulled away and won his first Grand Prix since South Africa in from Berger, Nannini, Prost, Piquet and Alesi.

===Race 4: Monaco===

In Monaco, Senna took pole but Prost was second with Alesi third ahead of Patrese, Berger and Boutsen. At the start, Berger collided with Prost at Mirabeau, blocking the track and stopping the race. The second start was all right and Senna led from Prost, Alesi, Berger, Patrese and Boutsen.

The race settled down and nothing changed until lap 30 when Prost retired with a battery failure. Then Mansell hit the back of Boutsen and was forced to pit and changed his front wing. Patrese&#x27;s distributor failed on lap 42. Behind, Mansell was charging through the field and passed Boutsen to take fourth. But then he was sidelined with the same problem as Prost. At the front, Senna won from Alesi, Berger, Boutsen, Alex Caffi in the Arrows and Éric Bernard&#x27;s Larrousse.

===Race 5: Canada===

Canada was next and at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal the McLarens were 1–2 in qualifying with Senna ahead of Berger with Prost third, Nannini fourth, Piquet fifth and Boutsen sixth. The track was damp on race day and Berger jumped the start and then hesitated. He got a 1-minute time penalty as well as allowing Senna to lead on the road. Senna led Nannini, Alesi, Prost, Boutsen and Piquet.

The track began to dry and everyone pitted. But when Nannini rejoined, he hit a groundhog and had to pit again for repairs. He spun off on lap 22. Berger took the lead on the road but he needed a minute to stay ahead at the end. He charged and was a second quicker than the others as Boutsen spun off while battling Prost. Senna now led from Prost, Piquet, Mansell, Patrese and Derek Warwick.

Piquet after many laps finally passed Prost who was then attacked by Mansell. Patrese retired putting Berger to fifth (he got ahead of Warwick before). Mansell passed Prost and slowly pulled away. With two laps to go, Berger got past Prost on aggregate but could not get ahead of Mansell. Senna won from Piquet, Mansell, Berger, Prost and Warwick.

===Race 6: Mexico===

After Canada came the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City and Berger qualified on pole position with Patrese beside him and Senna third, Mansell fourth, Boutsen fifth and Alesi sixth. At the start, Patrese and Berger jumped Senna while Piquet got ahead of Boutsen and Mansell. Early on, Senna passed Patrese and Berger followed him through. Patrese was dropping back and Piquet got by him as well. Boutsen was the next to go through but at the same time Berger had a problem with his tyre and was forced to stop and dropped to 12th position. Senna lead from Piquet, Boutsen, Patrese, Mansell and Prost.

Soon, Mansell passed Patrese and got Boutsen four laps later as Prost did the same to Patrese. Prost sneaked ahead of Boutsen as Mansell closed in on Piquet. Mansell got ahead on lap 36 and Prost followed him through six laps later. Piquet soon stopped and dropped behind Nannini, Boutsen (who already stopped) and Berger. Berger passed Boutsen on lap 47 and Nannini four laps later. Prost passed Mansell on lap 55 and they began to close in on Senna. Prost, passed Senna followed by Mansell. Then Mansell spun but at the same time Senna got a puncture that let to him retiring in the pits 4 laps before the end and allowing Berger to get third and close in to Mansell. With a daring move Berger passed Mansell but Mansell charged back and attacked taking back second place after making an even more daring pass around the outside of Berger at the fastest corner on the track, the 180-degree Peraltada corner. Prost won with Mansell second making it a Ferrari 1–2 ahead of Berger, Nannini, Boutsen and Piquet.

===Race 7: France===

France was next, being held at the Paul Ricard circuit near the coastal city of Marseille. The fans were wearing red and a Ferrari did take pole position. However, it was not their hero Prost but Mansell who was ahead of Berger, Senna, Prost, Nannini and Patrese. At the start, Berger got past Mansell while Prost lost out as well. Berger led with Mansell, Senna, Nannini, Patrese and Prost behind. On lap 2, Senna passed Mansell for second and soon after Prost passed Patrese. The order stayed like that until Senna passed Berger who had been too hard on his tyres in the early stages.

Nannini and Piquet pitted early while Berger and Senna went too late. Mansell&#x27;s and Prost&#x27;s tyres lasted longer and thus they pitted late. Riccardo Patrese went too late and was the big loser. This left the two Leyton Houses (they planned the race without a stop) ahead with a totally shuffled order behind them. Ivan Capelli led Maurício Gugelmin, Prost, Nannini, Mansell and Senna. Prost then caught and passed Gugelmin who then went out with engine trouble.

As Prost closed in on Capelli, Mansell in 8th place could not get by Berger, Piquet and Senna. Capelli continued to defend from Prost as Mansell went out with engine trouble. Nannini moved into third but was then forced to retire with electrical trouble, while Prost finally passed Capelli with three laps to go. Prost won ahead of Capelli, Senna, Piquet, Berger and Patrese.

===Race 8: Great Britain===

Britain was next and Mansell, roared on by his home fans at the fast Silverstone airfield circuit, took pole from Senna, followed by Berger, Boutsen, Prost and Alesi. Senna passed Mansell at the first corner and led for the first 11 laps before Mansell retook the lead; the Brazilian then spun on lap 14, dropping down to fifth.

As Prost passed Boutsen for third, Mansell began to have troubles with his gearbox. Berger passed him for the lead on lap 22 but then began to suffer handling issues, enabling Mansell to re-pass him on lap 28. Meanwhile, Prost closed up to both drivers, before passing Berger on lap 31 and then Mansell on lap 44 as the Englishman&#x27;s gearbox issues worsened.

Mansell remained second until lap 56 when his gearbox failed altogether; he promptly threw his gloves into the crowd and announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the season. Capelli briefly ran third ahead of Berger before his fuel pipe broke; Berger&#x27;s race then ended four laps from home with a throttle failure. This left Prost to win by nearly 40 seconds from Boutsen, the Belgian driver in turn finishing four seconds ahead of Senna. Bernard, Piquet and Aguri Suzuki rounded out the top six.

At the halfway stage of the season, Prost led the Drivers&#x27; Championship by two points from Senna, 41 to 39, with Berger third with 25 points, Piquet fourth with 18 and Boutsen fifth with 17. McLaren led the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 64 points, followed by Ferrari on 54, Williams on 27 and Benetton on 25.

===Race 9: Germany===
At the start of the second half of the season, there was one change in pre-qualifying: Larrousse-Lola&#x27;s five points meant that they were automatically promoted into main qualifying, dropping fellow French team Ligier into the Friday morning session. Meanwhile, Coloni had terminated their unsuccessful partnership with Subaru and were now using Cosworth engines, although these failed to improve the team&#x27;s performance.

At the very fast, forested Hockenheimring, McLarens were 1–2 in qualifying, Senna ahead of Berger. Ferraris were 3–4 with Prost ahead of Mansell and Williamses were 5–6 to complete the &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; (two-by-two) formation, Patrese ahead of Boutsen. At the start, Berger took off better than Senna but Senna just stayed ahead with Berger second, Prost third, Mansell fourth, Patrese fifth and Piquet sixth.

There were no changes until lap 11 when Piquet tried to pass Patrese and went through an escape road, allowing Nannini to get ahead. Three laps later Mansell went through the grass at Ostkurve without losing a place but damaging his car. It proved crucial as he retired two laps later, the damage being too great. Meanwhile, Nannini passed Patrese as the top three stopped for tyres, the Williamses and Benettons planning to go without a stop. Piquet retired with engine trouble.

Thus, Nannini led Senna, Patrese, Piquet, Berger and Prost. Patrese&#x27;s tyres were very badly damaged and he was forced to pit. Prost then passed Boutsen for fourth with Patrese following him two laps later. On lap 34, Senna passed Nannini for the lead and pulled away. Senna won from Nannini, Berger, Prost, Patrese and Boutsen.

===Race 10: Hungary===

Hungary was next and at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród, the Williamses qualified ahead of the McLarens, Boutsen taking pole ahead of Patrese, Berger, Senna, Mansell and Alesi. At the start, Boutsen kept the lead but it was Berger who got away best and passed Patrese while Senna was worse and lost out to both Mansell and Alesi. Thus, it was Boutsen, Berger, Patrese, Mansell, Alesi and Senna.

It stayed like that until lap 21 when Senna passed Alesi for fifth but he was forced to pit on the next lap with a slow puncture. Nannini soon passed Alesi to take fifth. The leaders stopped and Berger was the big loser with Nannini and Senna the big gainers, rising directly behind the Williams men. The order was: Boutsen, Patrese, Nannini, Senna, Mansell and Berger. Boutsen then pulled away while Patrese held up the others until Nannini streamed by with Senna following him.

Patrese then pitted and dropped behind Piquet as Berger passed Mansell only for Mansell to get back at him. Senna tried to pass Nannini on lap 64 and tipped Nannini into a spin and retirement. Berger tried to do the same thing on Mansell on lap 72 at the same corner with the same result – a collision but with both cars out. Boutsen won ahead of Senna, Piquet, Patrese, Warwick and Bernard.

===Race 11: Belgium===

The financially troubled Monteverdi Onyx team pulled out of F1 before the Belgian round, which allowed the Ligier team to escape from pre-qualifying. At the historic Spa-Francorchamps circuit, McLaren were 1–2 with Senna on pole ahead of Berger, Prost, Boutsen, Mansell and Patrese. At the start, Piquet pushed Mansell off the road and soon Nakajima and Modena collided as well, causing the race to be stopped.

At the second start, Senna took the lead while Boutsen sliced into second and Prost dropped to fifth. However, Paolo Barilla crashed his Minardi heavily at Eau Rouge, sending debris all over the track and causing the race to be stopped again.

The third start was clean and Senna took the lead ahead of Berger, Prost, Boutsen, Patrese and Nannini. On lap 11, Mansell went into the pits with handling problems; he went back out but retired eight laps later. On lap 14, Prost sliced ahead of Berger who then pitted for tyres. Senna and Prost, separated by 2 seconds stopped at the same time but then Nannini who was planning to go without stopping came in between them. Then both Patrese and Boutsen went out with gearbox troubles. Prost passed Nannini and Berger tried the same but this time Nannini came back at him to keep the place. On lap 41, Nannini went wide and Berger sailed through to take third. Senna duly won from Prost, Berger, Nannini, Piquet and Gugelmin.

With five races remaining, the Drivers&#x27; Championship now lay firmly between Senna with 63 points and Prost with 50. Berger was third with 33, Boutsen fourth with 27, and Piquet fifth with 24. McLaren held a comfortable lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 96 points against Ferrari&#x27;s 63, with Williams third with 42, and Benetton fourth with 40.

===Race 12: Italy===
After Belgium came Italy and at the historic Monza Autodrome near Milan, Senna took pole again with Prost second, Berger third, Mansell fourth, Alesi fifth and Boutsen sixth. At the start, Berger raced past Prost while Alesi was jumped by both the Ferraris. But Warwick crashed at the Parabolica, bringing out the red flags. In the restart, Berger got past Prost and Alesi repeated his previous effort and had passed both Ferraris before the second chicane, so we had Senna leading Berger, Alesi, Prost, Mansell and Boutsen.

On lap 5, Alesi spun off and retired. Nothing changed until lap 18 when Boutsen retired with a suspension failure and Berger&#x27;s tyres began to fade. Prost then passed Berger and the stops did not change anything. The top three then began to battle for the lead but none were able to close in on the other while Mansell continued to drop back, fighting a faulty throttle return spring. Senna won from Prost, Berger, Mansell, Patrese and Nakajima.

===Race 13: Portugal===

In Portugal, at the Estoril circuit near Lisbon, the Ferraris took 1–2 in qualifying with Mansell ahead of Prost, Senna, Berger, Patrese and Piquet. At the start, Mansell got too much wheel spin and he slid across the track and almost took Prost out; as a result, the McLarens blasted by them with Piquet getting by Prost as well. The order was: Senna, Berger, Mansell, Piquet, Prost and Boutsen.

On lap 13, Prost overtook Piquet for fourth and later Mansell went to the grass, allowing Prost to take third. Mansell and Berger pitted soon as Prost passed Senna at the same time to lead. These two soon pitted as well with a shuffled order: Senna, Mansell, Berger, Prost, Nannini and Piquet. By then, the Ferraris started to close in on the McLarens in front of them. Behind them, Piquet passed Nannini to take fifth.

On lap 50, Mansell was close to Senna and passed him to lead. He pulled away fast but then hit Phillipe Alliot while lapping him, pushing the Ligier into a wall while Mansell got away with no damage. Prost then passed Berger on lap 59. Two laps later, Suzuki and Caffi collided and with the latter stuck in the cockpit in a zone with the wall next to the track, the race was stopped. Thus Mansell won from Senna, Prost, Berger, Piquet and Nannini.

===Race 14: Spain===

Qualifying in Spain, at the Jerez circuit near Seville, was marred by a serious incident involving Martin Donnelly. During a hot lap on the Friday, the Northern Irishman suffered a suspension failure on one of the fastest corners of the circuit, sending his Lotus into the barriers head-on. The car was destroyed while Donnelly was thrown across the track with his seat still strapped to his back; he suffered severe leg fractures and bruising on his brain and lungs. Remarkably, he survived, though his Formula One career was over.

Senna, shaken by this incident, took his 50th career pole position ahead of Prost, Mansell, Alesi, Berger and Patrese. At the start, Senna led away from Prost, while Alesi was hit by Patrese and spun into retirement. Mansell kept up with the championship challengers, while Berger struggled on hard tyres and held up the Williams and Benettons. The pit stops saw Mansell get ahead of Prost before waving his teammate through; he did so just as Senna was emerging from his own stop. The Brazilian, realising that he could not afford to be behind Mansell, dived ahead of him.

Piquet, who had not pitted, held a narrow lead over Prost; the Frenchman pressured him into running wide on lap 29, dropping him down to fourth. He eventually retired with battery problems. Senna began to struggle with a punctured radiator, and was passed by Mansell before dropping out on lap 54. Nannini was now up to third while Boutsen and Berger disputed fourth; the two tangled on lap 57, sending Berger into retirement. Prost and Mansell duly completed a Ferrari 1–2, the Frenchman 22 seconds ahead, with Nannini, Boutsen, Patrese and Suzuki completing the top six.

With two races to go, Senna had 78 points to Prost&#x27;s 69; both had had eleven points finishes and would therefore have to drop points if they scored again. Senna was still in a strong position, however, as a win or a second place (if Prost did not win) in the next race would give him the championship. Berger was third with 40, Mansell was up to fourth with 31 and Boutsen was fifth with 30. Similarly, McLaren retained a strong position in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 118 points against Ferrari&#x27;s 100, with Williams a distant third with 49, and Benetton fourth with 47.

===Race 15: Japan===
Before the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, Nannini was involved in a helicopter crash, suffering a severed right forearm. Though it was reattached using microsurgery, his F1 career ended. Meanwhile, the EuroBrun and Life teams withdrew (meaning that pre-qualifying was unnecessary); Benetton duly took on EuroBrun&#x27;s Roberto Moreno as Nannini&#x27;s replacement.

In qualifying, Senna took pole ahead of Prost, Mansell, Berger, Boutsen and Piquet. However, Senna was unhappy at the pole being located on the dirty side of the track and thus the second place being on the racing line which should give the second-placed driver the advantage into the first corner. He went to FISA president Jean Marie Balestre to change the side on which pole was located, but was refused. After this, he decided that he would intentionally drive his race car into Prost&#x27;s Ferrari into the first corner if Prost had the advantage. At the start, Prost did have the advantage and Senna drove into the Frenchman, who drove the normal racing line. Senna&#x27;s left front touched Prost&#x27;s rear wing, spinning both of them into the gravel trap. The world championship was sealed.

Although Senna led by 9 points and there were 9 points for a win, if Prost won the last race he would have had to drop his fifth place in Canada which meant that he would be two points behind Senna even if Senna retired. Senna was the new world champion. In the race Berger was leading Mansell, Piquet, Moreno, Boutsen and Patrese. At the start of the second lap, Berger spun off into retirement after hitting debris from the Senna-Prost collision. This left Mansell who was under pressure by the Benettons leading.

Mansell then began to pull away from Piquet and Moreno as Suzuki passed Warwick for sixth. Mansell pitted with a 15-second lead on lap 27 for tyres but his driveshaft snapped as he went out of his garage. He retired giving the Constructors title to McLaren as they were 18 points ahead and a 1–2 could get only 15 points. The Benettons and Suzuki did not stop but Patrese and Boutsen did with Patrese getting ahead at the stops but both rejoined behind Suzuki. Then Nakajima passed Warwick to take sixth as Warwick then retired with gearbox trouble. Piquet won with Moreno making it a Benetton 1–2. Suzuki was third, Patrese fourth, Boutsen fifth and Nakajima sixth.

===Race 16: Australia===

The last race of the year was in Australia for what would be the 500th World Championship Grand Prix race, and at the Adelaide City street circuit the McLarens took 1–2 in qualifying ahead of the Ferraris, Senna ahead of Berger, Mansell, Prost, Alesi and Patrese. At the start, Senna took off into the lead with Berger defending from the Ferraris and Piquet getting by Alesi and Patrese. The order was: Senna, Berger, Mansell, Prost, Piquet and Alesi.

On lap 2, Berger accidentally hit the engine kill switch allowing Mansell to get ahead before he could bump start the McLaren. Then while defending from Prost, he held up Prost allowing Piquet to get ahead of the Frenchman. Piquet then soon passed Berger for third and the order settled down. Senna and Mansell continued to pull away from the rest, none of them able to keep up. Soon Patrese got past Alesi with Boutsen following suit.

Then, on lap 43, Mansell went up an escape road, giving Senna a good lead. Mansell was caught and passed by Piquet and pitted for tyres soon after. At the stops, Boutsen got ahead of Patrese. Berger then ran wide entering the Brabham straight, allowing Prost to take third. Mansell passed Berger on lap 57 and soon passed Prost on his new tyres. Senna had a gearbox glitch on lap 62 and went straight on into the wall and retired. Mansell closed in on Piquet, breaking the lap record 3 times towards the finish, taking 2 seconds a lap out of his lead. Piquet made an error with 4 laps to go, allowing Mansell to close right up. Mansell attacked on the last lap with a desperate passing attempt at the end of the straight, was too far behind to make the pass. Thus, Piquet won from Mansell, Prost, Berger, Boutsen and Patrese.

At the end of the season, Senna was world champion with 78 points with Prost second with 71 (he got 73 but had to drop 2 points), Piquet third with 43 (he got 44 but had to drop 1 point), Berger fourth with 43 (Piquet had 2 wins to Berger&#x27;s none), Mansell fifth with 37, Boutsen sixth with 34, Patrese seventh with 23 and Nannini eighth with 21. In the constructors, McLaren were champions with 121 points with Ferrari second with 110, Benetton third with 71 and Williams fourth with 55.

<doc id="1137710" wikidata="Q5212240" url="?curid=1137710" title="Damian Drum">
<text>Damian Kevin Drum (born 28 July 1960) is an Australian politician who has represented Murray and Nicholls in the Australian House of Representatives since the 2016 federal election as a member of The Nationals. Drum served as the Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister in the Second Turnbull Ministry between 20 December 2017 and 5 March 2018.

Drum is a former member for the North Western Province, and later the Northern Victoria Region, in the Legislative Council of Victoria between 2002 and 2016. Drum served as the Victorian Minister for Sports and Veterans Affairs in the Napthine Ministry from March to December 2014.

He is also a former Australian rules footballer and coach, most notably as senior coach of the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League from 1999 to 2001. He turned to a life in politics after being sacked as Fremantle&#x27;s coach during the 2001 season.

==Early life==
Drum was born in Shepparton. After graduating from high school, he became a carpenter and joiner, running his own shed construction business for several years.

==Playing career==

===Geelong Football Club (VFL) (1982–1989)===
At the same time, he embarked on a football career and was drafted to the then-VFL&#x27;s Geelong Football Club in 1981. Over the next nine years, he played 63 games for Geelong. While playing football, he also operated his own business selling sheds and garages. He retired from the VFL at the end of 1989, and joined Victorian Football Association club Werribee in 1991.

==Coaching career==
In 1993, he quit his business and took up a coaching position with Port Melbourne in the VFA, leading the club to a grand final loss against his former club, Werribee. In 1994, he moved to Sydney, taking up a position as the assistant coach of the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League (AFL), under senior coach Ron Barassi. Drum served for five years in the role of assistant coach at the Sydney Swans.

===Fremantle Football Club senior coach (AFL) (1999–2001)===
Drum was approached by Fremantle, which had not renewed the contract of their first senior coach, Gerard Neesham, who was sacked at the end of the 1998 season, where Fremantle under Neesham finished fifteenth (second-last) position on the ladder . Drum had been one of the most highly anticipated coaching recruits of the season, and some were surprised that he signed with the struggling Dockers. He had been expected to sign with the Collingwood Football Club the previous year, but the deal had fallen through. Drum then became the senior coach of Fremantle Football Club, when he replaced Neesham.

Drum coached Fremantle for three seasons, during which the side suffered from a lack of success. In his first season, the club finished fifteenth (second-last) at the end of the 1999 season. There was a slight improvement in his second season, in which Fremantle won several high-profile games; still, the club struggled, finishing twelfth at the end of the 2000 season. However, it was the 2001 season, in which Fremantle lost their first nine games of the season, that sealed Drum&#x27;s fate. Drum was sacked after the club&#x27;s round-nine loss to the Sydney Swans, and was replaced by former Fremantle player and inaugural club captain Ben Allan as caretaker senior coach of Fremantle Football Club for the rest of the 2001 season, who did not fare much better, with the Dockers still winless after Round 17 in a 22-round season. At the end of the 2001 season, Allan was replaced by Chris Connolly as Fremantle Football Club senior coach.

===Bendigo Diggers Football Club senior coach (VFL) (2002)=== 
After losing the Fremantle job, Drum moved back to Victoria and took up a position as senior coach of the Bendigo Diggers in the Victorian Football League. The situation was similar to Fremantle, where the Diggers finished the season winless, with a single draw against the Murray Kangaroos. At the end of the 2002 season, Drum decided to retire from football and move into politics, successfully seeking Nationals pre-selection for the Victorian Legislative Council seat of North Western Province at the 2002 state election.

==Political career==
===Victorian parliament===
Drum was first elected to parliament in 2002 during the Labor Party landslide, in which many seats across the state fell to the minority government, and numerous shadow ministers lost their seats. Drum was elected despite the losses sustained by the conservative parties, with the Liberal Party losing a net total of 26 seats while the Nationals suffered a net loss of only one seat.

Despite being a newly elected member with no previous political experience, Drum advanced quickly in the Nationals&#x27; ranks. The Liberal and National parties had broken off their Coalition in 2000, and hence fought the 2002 election separately. As a result, the Nationals had to organise a shadow cabinet of their own. Drum soon found himself Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council, party Whip, and Shadow Minister for Youth Affairs, Education Services, Sport, Recreation, Racing, Consumer Affairs and the Commonwealth Games. From 2003 onward, he was a member of the Environment and Natural Resources Committee.

For the 2006 election the Legislative Council underwent major structural changes. Drum&#x27;s previous seat of North-West Region was replaced by the much larger Northern Victoria Region and preferential-proportional (multi-seat) rather than majority-preferential (one seat per election) voting. Drum was easily elected with a quota in his own right and was the only National Party member for the region.

In March 2014, Drum was appointed Minister for Sports and Veterans Affairs in the Napthine coalition government, serving until the government was defeated at the 2014 state election.

===Federal parliament===
On 11 April 2016, the Nationals announced that Drum had been preselected to contest the federal seat of Murray at the 2016 federal election. He resigned from the Victorian Legislative Council on 26 May, prior to the closing date for the nomination of candidates for the federal election. The seat had been held by the Liberal&#x27;s Sharman Stone, who announced her retirement on 26 March 2016. Because there was no sitting Coalition member, a three-cornered-contest for the seat ensued, in which Drum defeated his Liberal opponent, Duncan McGauchie, son of Donald McGauchie. Drum ultimately prevailed with 55 percent of the two-party vote to McGauchie&#x27;s 44 percent. But this did not make Murray a marginal seat. It had been held by either the Liberals or Nationals since its creation in 1949; the Coalition would have won it with well over 70 percent of the vote in a &quot;traditional&quot; two-party matchup with Labor. Indeed, much of the region had been held by a conservative party without interruption since Federation.

Drum became a vocal supporter of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Nationals leader Michael McCormack during 2018, even going so far as to publicly call for former prime minister Tony Abbott to retire from parliament. After an unsuccessful leadership challenge against McCormack in February 2020, it was reported that McCormack has made an unprecedented intervention to attempt to forestall the closure of a 40-bed aged care facility in Drum&#x27;s electorate by procuring a grant within four days that raised questions about due process.

Murray was abolished ahead of the 2019 election, and was essentially replaced by the Division of Nicholls. This seat was as comfortably safe as its predecessor, and Drum won the new seat at that election with 70 percent of the two-party vote.

Drum was nominated in 2020 by the government as the new Deputy Speaker but was defeated in a secret vote by Llew O&#x27;Brien, a fellow National Party member who had quit the party that morning and was nominated by the ALP. The surprise defeat was attributed to ongoing leadership tension in the wake of Barnaby Joyce&#x27;s unsuccessful challenge against Michael McCormack for the Nationals leadership. In May 2020, Drum made headlines when he was public quoted attacking NSW Deputy Premier and state Nationals leader John Barilaro in the wake of Barilaro&#x27;s decision not to contest the Eden-Monaro by-election. In response to some commentary suggesting that a switch to federal politics would enable Barilaro to succeed McCormack as federal party leader, Drum strongly defended McCormack and described the latter as a &quot;trojan&quot;. It emerged in the fallout from Barilaro&#x27;s decision that Barilaro had sent text messages to McCormack criticising his leadership and failure to support Barilaro&#x27;s planned switch to federal politics, with Drum accusing Barilaro of leaking the exchanges to the media. Having condemned Barilaro for alleged leaking, later the same day Drum would express shock that copies of misogynistic text messages about Barilaro&#x27;s wife that Drum had exchanged in a WhatsApp group with party colleagues Darren Chester and Kevin Hogan had been leaked to the media.

In December 2021, Drum announced he would retire at the 2022 election.

<doc id="1137718" wikidata="Q69641" url="?curid=1137718" title="1989 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 1989 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 43rd season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It began on 26 March and ended on 5 November. Alain Prost won his third Drivers&#x27; Championship, and McLaren won the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

The Drivers&#x27; Championship was decided in controversial circumstances at the penultimate race of the season in Japan, when Prost and teammate Ayrton Senna, who needed to win the race, collided in the closing laps. Prost retired while Senna rejoined the track after a push start and crossed the line first, only to be disqualified for not rejoining the track correctly. This handed Prost the title, his last with McLaren before joining Ferrari in 1990.

The season also saw an unprecedented number of entries, with 21 constructors originally entered, fielding a total of 40 cars. However, FIRST Racing withdrew from the championship before the opening race, leaving 20 constructors fielding a total of 39 cars, which remains the highest entry in the modern era.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1989 FIA Formula One World Championship. FIRST Racing injected material into their chassis in order to pass a mandatory FIA pre-season crash test, however, it made its car significantly overweight and they withdrew before the opening Brazilian Grand Prix. After this, they instead focused on the Formula 3000 series.
* Despite being on the entry list, the FIRST team did not contest any races.
*† All engines were 3.5-litre displacement configuration.

===Team and driver changes===
McLaren, having won fifteen of the sixteen races in , kept their successful driver line-up of and World Champion Alain Prost and defending champion Ayrton Senna. They would drive the new MP4/5 powered by a Honda V10 engine.

Ferrari completed the signing of British driver Nigel Mansell, taking the place of Michele Alboreto alongside Austrian Gerhard Berger. The new 640, designed by John Barnard, featured a semi-automatic electronic gearbox, the first of its kind, as well as the team&#x27;s first 12-cylinder engine since .

Williams recruited Belgian driver Thierry Boutsen from Benetton as Mansell&#x27;s replacement, alongside veteran Italian Riccardo Patrese. The team had also done a deal with Renault, returning to F1 after a three-year break, that would see them have exclusive use of the French company&#x27;s V10 engines. For most of the season, Williams ran with the FW12C, an updated version of their 1988 car, before the new FW13 was introduced at the Portuguese Grand Prix.

Lotus kept their 1988 line-up of triple World Champion Nelson Piquet and Satoru Nakajima, but lost their Honda engines. The new Lotus 101, designed by Frank Dernie, used the Judd V8 engine instead.

Benetton retained Alessandro Nannini and signed British rookie Johnny Herbert to replace Boutsen. However, Herbert was still recovering from severe foot injuries sustained in a Formula 3000 crash at Brands Hatch, and was eventually replaced by McLaren test driver Emanuele Pirro. Benetton continued as the de facto works Ford team, but had to make do with the Cosworth DFR-powered 1988 car, the B188, until the new HB-powered B189 was introduced at the French Grand Prix.

Tyrrell retained Jonathan Palmer and took back Alboreto, who had previously driven for the team between and . After a sponsorship dispute, Alboreto was replaced by French newcomer Jean Alesi, who at the same time was on his way to winning the F3000 championship.

The Brabham team returned after missing 1988, with Stefano Modena and Martin Brundle (fresh from winning the 1988 World Sports Prototype Championship) driving the Judd-powered BT58. Both drivers were forced to pre-qualify for the first half of the season.

The French Larrousse team continued running Lola chassis, but ditched the Ford Cosworth V8 engines in favour of the new Lamborghini V12, designed by Mauro Forghieri. The team started the year with their 1988 line-up of Yannick Dalmas and Philippe Alliot, but Dalmas was recovering from Legionnaires&#x27; disease and was eventually replaced by Éric Bernard, who in turn made way for Alboreto.

Zakspeed, having produced their own turbo engines since their debut in , were forced to switch to an outside supplier in the form of Yamaha, the Japanese company appearing in F1 for the first time with its own V8 engine. Their new car, the 891, was designed by Gustav Brunner. West German Bernd Schneider, in his second year with the team, and Japan&#x27;s Aguri Suzuki were both forced to pre-qualify throughout the season .

Osella were one of several teams to expand from one car to two, with Nicola Larini being joined by veteran Piercarlo Ghinzani, returning for a third stint with the team. The all-new FA1M was powered by the Ford Cosworth DFR.

Ligier retained French veteran René Arnoux and signed newcomer Olivier Grouillard, who replaced experienced Swede Stefan Johansson. The team also switched from Judd engines to the Ford Cosworth DFR, powering the new JS33.

AGS had retained Philippe Streiff for 1989, but the Frenchman crashed heavily at Rio while testing prior to the Brazilian Grand Prix, suffering spinal injuries which left him as a quadriplegic and ended his racing career. His place was taken by Gabriele Tarquini, who had planned to drive for the Italian FIRST team that year before they pulled out. AGS also expanded to two cars, the second originally being driven by Joachim Winkelhock, younger brother of the late Manfred Winkelhock.

After FIRST Racing withdrew from the championship, the only entirely new team for 1989 was Onyx Grand Prix, who had previously enjoyed success as the semi-works March team in Formula Two and Formula 3000. The Onyx ORE-1, designed by Alan Jenkins and powered by the Ford Cosworth DFR, was driven by Johansson and Belgian rookie Bertrand Gachot, who would eventually be replaced by Finnish newcomer JJ Lehto.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* In order to combat rising costs, turbocharged engines were banned at the end of , as the governing body felt them to be making the sport dangerous and expensive. However, turbocharged engines returned from the season onwards.
* The engine displacement was mandated at .
* In the interest of safety, the driver&#x27;s feet must be situated behind the front axle-line. This rule had been introduced in 1988 and was mandatory for all new chassis, but any that were a carry-over from were not obliged to comply with the rule which was only made compulsory for all cars from 1989. Due to the loss of the powerful turbo engines, designers were locked in a race to make the cars as aerodynamic as possible, as such designers were introducing cockpits and front ends that were smaller and far more cramped than ever, at the expense of driver comfort. The problem was first highlighted at the opening round in Brazil, with focus on the Ross Brawn-designed Arrows cars. Both drivers, Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever, suffered severe cramping and felt that the new regulations were in fact making it more dangerous, Cheever saying that &quot;if (he) got sideways ... (he) simply cannot correct with the steering wheel&quot; due to his lanky frame.

===Sporting and event regulations===
* Race distances were standardised at in order to keep the races within the two-hour time limit. At slower street circuits like Monaco, the set distance could be lower. In 1989, the race distances varied from to , with the aforementioned exceptions.
* The arrival of the Onyx team, the return of Brabham, and the expansion of other teams from one car to two meant that there were now 39 drivers competing for 26 places on the starting grid. So pre-qualifying was retained from and expanded to 13 cars. The four fastest cars would be allowed into the main qualifying session, from which the 26 fastest cars would be allowed to race.
* Trackside barriers had to have a minimum height of , with the wall separating the pit lane from the start/finish straight at minimum.

==Season report==


===Pre-season testing===
As was the tradition in Formula One in the 1980s, pre-season testing took place at the Jacarepaguá Autodrome in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Teams would travel there for 10 days in March to test and acclimatise to Rio&#x27;s very hot and humid weather. The 1989 testing sessions saw several major accidents. Thierry Boutsen crashed heavily in his Williams, and later, Frenchman Philippe Streiff crashed violently at the third corner, a fast, flat out left hander called &quot;Suspiro&quot;. The AGS-Ford he was driving broke its rear suspension and he went head-on into the barriers. The impact broke the car&#x27;s roll-over bar, and Streiff suffered severe back injuries and was left in a coma. He survived but was permanently paralyzed from the neck down.

===Race 1: Brazil===
The climate as the Formula One circus arrived at Jacarepaguá was one of much optimism in what many saw as a new age, with many revelling in the brutal and much more appealing sounds of the V10 and V12 engines. Brazil proved to be an excitement filled race, and dramatic too. Qualifying had a few surprises, with Riccardo Patrese, scoring his first front row start since , next to the home favourite, world champion Ayrton Senna. Williams and Renault were both surprised by the position, but both highly pleased with Thierry Boutsen qualifying fourth alongside the high powered Ferrari of Berger and in front of Prost who could only manage 5th.

The race started with a bang, as Senna&#x27;s hopes at a home Grand Prix victory were dashed after a clash with Berger in the first turn. In what would prove to be a regular occurrence during the season, the semi-automatic transmission in the Ferrari 640 allowed Berger to get a lightning start from 3rd on the grid and he attempted to go inside of Senna and Patrese into the turn. Senna refused to give room, causing a collision that destroyed the front wing of his car. Patrese got through unscathed and in the lead of his record-breaking 177th Grand Prix start whilst Berger was out on the spot (the first of ten straight retirements for the Austrian driver) while Senna was forced to pit for repairs and would finish the race two laps down in eleventh place.

Double world champion Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren had been having problems all weekend with the Frenchman finding the McLaren MP4/5 hard to set up, and when his two stop strategy was ruined by a clutch failure, he knew he had to continue the race having made just one of his scheduled two pit stops on the notoriously abrasive Rio circuit. He finished second. Nigel Mansell secured a surprising win for the Scuderia, with no problems despite ongoing gearbox faults all weekend and a lack of winter testing (Mansell also had the steering wheel come loose on the back straight and had to have it changed in his final stop, which luckily was scheduled for the end of that lap). The final step of the podium was taken by local Maurício Gugelmin. Grand Prix debutant Johnny Herbert, Derek Warwick and Alessandro Nannini scored the remaining points. Warwick was desperately unlucky. He lost over 20 seconds in a slow pit stop and only finished 17.8 seconds behind Mansell at the finish suggesting a win (which would have been both his and Arrows&#x27; first) or podium place had gone begging.

During the awards ceremony, Mansell cut his hand open on the trophy, ending the celebration early.

This was to be the last race at this fast, flat and abrasive Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro. Formula One would move to a shortened Interlagos circuit in Senna&#x27;s hometown of São Paulo for the 1990 season onwards.

===Race 2: San Marino===
At Imola in Italy, &quot;normal service&quot; was resumed. McLaren settled on the front row of the grid and stayed that way for the race, with Mansell&#x27;s Ferrari retiring midway with gearbox issues. Gerhard Berger, despite showing promise by setting the fastest time in the wet Friday qualifying, suffered front wing failure thanks to Berger&#x27;s curb hopping style and careered off the track at Tamburello at high speed and hit the concrete retaining wall very hard and spun multiple times along the wall. This forced the race to be stopped after the fuel spilled all over Berger&#x27;s car burst into flames after the car came to a standstill. Berger miraculously survived with just a broken rib, shoulder bone and burns to his back and hands, due to rescue crews removing him from the wreck in less than 60 secs. He gave a thumbs up and the race was restarted not too long after. Senna went on to win with Prost second. Patrese&#x27;s engine failed and Boutsen was disqualified (but he got his 4th position back in an appeal), so the third place was taken by the Benetton Ford of Alessandro Nannini. Warwick and Tyrrell&#x27;s Jonathan Palmer secured the remaining point paying positions.

After the Grand Prix, Prost seemed disgruntled and said he wished to not make a comment on the race, other than that &quot;orders were not respected&quot;. Senna refused to comment on the matter. Before the race at Monaco, Prost said he wanted &quot;nothing to do with (Senna)&quot; and refused to speak with him.

===Race 3: Monaco===
With Berger out, there were 29 cars in qualifying instead of 30, because Ferrari did not have a replacement driver. Senna had scored his third pole of the season, with the number 2 car of Prost again alongside. March introduced their new 1989 design. Senna went on to win by almost a whole minute over Prost while Stefano Modena secured a valuable third for the underfunded Brabham team on its return to Formula One after a year out. This result effectively allowed Brabham to avoid prequalifying in the second half of the season. Modena, however, failed to score any points in any other Grand Prix in 1989. Alex Caffi finished 4th in the Dallara while Michele Alboreto secured his first points since leaving Ferrari for Tyrrell. Martin Brundle scored the remaining point by finishing 6th.

During practice Prost revealed his discontent with Senna. According to Prost the pair had an agreement that if they were leading, whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other at the first corner, an agreement he previously had with former teammates Niki Lauda and Keke Rosberg. Despite Marlboro&#x27;s John Hogan supporting Prost&#x27;s story by stating he was present when the agreement was made, Senna continued to deny that any such agreement existed. He also contended that the corner he passed Prost at, Tosa, was actually the third turn on the Imola circuit after Tamburello and Villeneuve.

===Race 4: Mexico===
At the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, Mexico, Gerhard Berger made a return despite continued pain in his fingers. However, transmission and gearbox problems forced the Ferraris to retire from point-scoring positions for the third race straight. While they lamented their results, McLaren and Senna took a third win on the trot by a differing choice of tyres. Prost&#x27;s choice, and the wrong set of tyres being given to him at a pit stop (which prompted team boss Ron Dennis to issue Prost a public apology after the race), sent him down the order to fifth. Patrese was second for Williams, while Alboreto doubled his efforts in Monaco by scoring third. Alessandro Nannini finished 4th while Gabriele Tarquini was able to bring his barely pre-qualified AGS home in sixth for a well-celebrated point.

Mexico was the first time that Prost would publicly complain that his Honda V10 did not seem to work as well as Senna&#x27;s, pointing out that early in the race he was clearly faster than Senna through the Peraltada curve heading onto the long front straight, but that even with a tow from Senna he was not able to make any ground on him. Then later in the race when Senna was coming up to lap Prost (who had much fresher tyres), the Brazilian was easily able to catch and pass him on the straight despite being slower through the final turn (it was later revealed that Prost ran less wing than Senna which should have theoretically given him better straight line speed).

===Race 5: United States===
The United States Grand Prix had a new destination, this time in the hot desert city of Phoenix, Arizona. It was a new place, but the same old dirty and dusty street circuits, and while wider, faster, less dirty and less bumpy than both Detroit and Dallas, like Detroit the mostly right angled turns on Phoenix&#x27;s street grid system gave the drivers few reference points for when to use their brakes- but this created many good overtaking spots. The dreadfully hot 100+ degree dry desert summer heat of Phoenix also made conditions trying; the track broke up during the race. Senna made the most of his skill and scored another pole, Prost again playing second fiddle by over a second. Prost though believed that his race set up was superior to his teammate&#x27;s and was confident of winning his first Grand Prix of the year.

Senna won the start and built up a small lead over Prost. Senna suffered an electrical problem when leading the race and his engine started to misfire. He signalled Prost through to a lead he would not lose on lap 34. Williams ended up being the only team to finish with both cars as the dirty track and unforgiving concrete walls ended six races, with the heat and dust cutting out many more. One driver, Alessandro Nannini, suffered from a severely sore neck after a crash in the morning warm-up and retired from fourth place on lap 10. Mansell and Berger suffered with the Ferrari V12s cutting out from identical alternator failures and both eventually retired. Patrese&#x27;s second gave him third place in the championship, while Prost took the lead. Ecstatic Phoenix native Eddie Cheever celebrated his and his team&#x27;s first podium of the season at his own home Grand Prix. The Brabhams, on the other hand, continued their lacklustre return, both drivers retiring with worn-out brakes. Dallara&#x27;s Alex Caffi was the victim of a bizarre crash. Holding down 5th place, he was put into the wall on lap 52 by his own teammate Andrea de Cesaris when he was trying to lap him. The notorious de Cesaris later claimed he did not even know Caffi was there trying to lap him.

The race of attrition saw Christian Danner score a surprise 4th place in his Rial, while Herbert and Boutsen rounded out the scoring zone. The race ran for the full 2 hours and was flagged after 75 of the scheduled 81 laps. Alain Prost scored his only ever win in the US, while Cheever&#x27;s 3rd place was his final podium in Formula One. Before the race with the heat and practice times proving some 10–15 seconds per lap slower than predicted, a petition was circulated among the teams requesting the race be reduced to 70 laps. All team managers signed the petition with the exception of Ken Tyrrell which meant the race was not officially shortened. Ironically, this would work against his team when Jonathan Palmer lost a certain 4th place after his Tyrrell-Ford ran out of fuel on lap 69. Had the race been flagged after 70 laps, Palmer would have finished 4th having already been lapped by Prost instead of running out of fuel and being classified as 9th and last.

===Race 6: Canada===
The Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal was run in wet conditions and provided many retirements, but also a new winner. Senna was comfortably leading with only three laps to go when engine problems forced him to retire, handing Boutsen his first victory. Patrese came home second to make it a 1–2 finish for Williams, the first time a team other than McLaren had achieved this since Ferrari in Monza the previous year. Making up for his Phoenix indiscretion, Andrea de Cesaris picked up third for Dallara, the first ever podium finish for the small Italian team.

Triple World Champion Nelson Piquet picked up his and Lotus&#x27;s first points of the year by finishing 4th, only 4.8 seconds behind de Cesaris. René Arnoux would score the final points of his career by finishing 5th for Ligier. Caffi snatched the final point by finishing 6th.

===Race 7: France===
In his home race at the Paul Ricard circuit near Marseille, Prost took pole and won convincingly, while fellow Frenchman Jean Alesi made his debut for the Tyrrell team, replacing Alboreto due to the team now having Camel sponsorship which conflicted with his personal Marlboro sponsorship. This proved to pay off as Alesi secured a fourth-place finish (having run second at one stage). Nigel Mansell ended Ferrari&#x27;s run of retirements with a secure second while Patrese was third. Swede Stefan Johansson finished 5th, scoring the Onyx team&#x27;s first points, and Olivier Grouillard took the final points paying position. Senna, meanwhile, was forced to retire straight after the restart with a differential problem.

The race had to be restarted when, on the first lap, Gugelmin caused a major first corner accident when he lost control of his March, flew into the air and landed on Mansell&#x27;s rear wing. Luckily, no one was hurt and all drivers managed to take the restart. The French marshals were widely criticised for tipping the upside down March back on its wheels before Gugelmin had a chance to get out of the car.

===Race 8: Great Britain===
The British Grand Prix at the very fast Silverstone circuit proved much the same – McLaren front row, Senna retiring from the lead after a spin, and Prost winning. Mansell finished second in his home race to please the British fans, whose Mansellmania coupled with the tifosi made for hysteria. Nannini finished third, Piquet 4th, while both Minardis, Martini followed by Pérez-Sala, took the final 2 points positions.

At this, the halfway point of the championship, Prost&#x27;s lead over Senna had increased to 20 points; Britain was the 4th consecutive race Senna had retired from- and Prost had won 3 of those 4 races. Despite much talk, he downplayed the thought of a third championship. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to start talking about the championship, getting into all that,&quot; he said, &quot;but I&#x27;m much happier now, yes. Motivated again. I&#x27;ve had no engine problems since Mexico, which is nice, and also I&#x27;m pleased to see Ferrari getting more competitive: both Nigel and Gerhard can win races and that can only help me.&quot;

===Race 9: Germany===
At Hockenheim in Germany (another very fast circuit) however, Senna&#x27;s bad luck ended after scoring a treble – pole, fastest lap and the win, but he had to fight almost all the way with Prost to do so. After both McLarens suffered bad mid-race stops for tyres, Prost emerged in the lead and looked to have the race in his grasp but lost top gear with less than two laps to go. Berger&#x27;s pointless season continued with a tire puncture causing a spectacular accident and robbing him of a possible podium. Mansell picked up a third place and mused everyone&#x27;s thoughts: &quot;If any of the circuits in the world is ideal for McLaren-Honda, it&#x27;s Hockenheim.&quot; Patrese, Piquet and Warwick took the remaining three points-paying positions, respectively.

===Race 10: Hungary===
The dirty Hungaroring near Budapest provided an almost gripless practice and qualifying, that eventually led to the first non-McLaren pole position of the year – Riccardo Patrese made a Senna-like performance with a 0.31 gap between him and Senna. Another surprise was the equally impressive Alex Caffi, who scored third with a time less than a second slower than that of Patrese – in a car that had been notoriously midfield. The Ferraris, however, suffered badly. Mansell was over two seconds off Patrese&#x27;s time of an impressive 1:19.7, whilst Berger constantly complained of gear shift troubles – even asking the team to change the gearbox pre-race, which they did not.

This eventually cost him a point scoring position, as the gearbox went on to fail. Countering this was Mansell&#x27;s impressive 12th-to-first race, even overtaking Senna in the area he excelled most, lapping back markers – an impressive move on a track notorious for mediocre and unpassable races. He went on to compare the race to his win at Silverstone two years earlier and dedicated it to the late Enzo Ferrari, a year after the Old Man&#x27;s death. Caffi&#x27;s race was the exact counterpoint of Mansell&#x27;s – despite a strong start he finished a lonely seventh, earning no points. Senna finished nearly half a minute behind Mansell in second, while Prost again suffered problems and finished fourth. Patrese retired from the lead and Boutsen finished third. The final two points positions were taken by American Eddie Cheever in the Arrows, finishing 5th, followed by Piquet in 6th.

===Race 11: Belgium===
A wet Spa showcased Senna&#x27;s wet weather skills at their best. &#x27;Magic&#x27; (Senna&#x27;s nickname during the wet) shone that day to give him another win despite engine troubles that also befell Prost with Mansell in third saying that problems like that he could certainly use – he finished less than two seconds behind Senna. Boutsen, Nannini and Warwick, in that order, took the final three points-paying positions.

===Race 12: Italy===
The Italian Grand Prix at the Monza Autodrome near Milan sealed the end of two things: Gerhard Berger&#x27;s terrible season (he scored a second place on both the grid and in the race) and Prost&#x27;s relationship with McLaren. Having become progressively distanced from the team due to his conflict with Senna, he announced his switch to Ferrari for 1990, and after inheriting the race win when Senna retired from the lead late on, he proceeded to give the trophy he had won to the tifosi. McLaren boss Ron Dennis&#x27; usual composure was shattered and he hurled his trophy at his driver&#x27;s feet, storming off (Dennis was unhappy with Prost giving the trophy to the tifosi as contractually all trophies won were the property of the team). Prost later said it was an unsatisfactory win and that he did not hold out much hope for the championship despite his points lead as he felt Honda were clearly favouring Senna. Boutsen inherited third for Williams. The final points went to Patrese, who finished fourth, followed by Brit Martin Brundle for Brabham and Jean Alesi in the Tyrrell.

===Race 13: Portugal===
The World Championship was virtually decided in the thirteenth round at Estoril near Lisbon, as Prost finished second to Berger and Senna retired in controversial circumstances when he collided with Mansell, who had illegally reversed in the pit-lane and ignored the resultant black disqualification flags. Mansell was subsequently banned from the next race.

This was Prost&#x27;s twelfth points finish of the season, which meant that he now had to drop points as only the eleven best points finishes counted, but he still led by 24 points with three races left.

Johansson finished a fine third for the struggling Onyx team (a result that meant they did not have to go through pre-qualifying in the first half of 1990), marveling at the car&#x27;s performance on a low-grip track and speaking of optimism for Spain. Nannini finished in fourth, while Pierluigi Martini qualified fifth and finished in that position, also leading for one lap; the only time in the Minardi team&#x27;s 21-year history that it led a Grand Prix. Tyrrell racing finished in sixth for the 2nd consecutive race, although it was Jonathan Palmer that earned the point for them in Portugal. The new Williamses, however, suffered near-simultaneous and identical motor blow-outs. Up until then they looked promising.

===Race 14: Spain===
Senna kept the championship alive in Spain by taking pole position and leading throughout, beating Berger by almost half a minute at the Jerez circuit near Seville. Prost drove a cautious race and finished third, dropping more points, but it meant that Senna had to win both remaining races to have any chance of beating the Frenchman to the title. Meanwhile, Alesi scored another strong fourth place for the Tyrrell team. Finishing 5th was Patrese ahead of Philippe Alliot who would score the only point of the season for the Larrousse-Lola team.

===Race 15: Japan===
Then the Formula One circus arrived at Suzuka, Japan near Nagoya for the now infamous penultimate round for the championship. Prost said he would not leave the door open for his teammate, who he felt had made far too many risky moves on him.

Senna took pole, but Prost beat him away from the grid and led by 1.4 seconds by the end of the first lap. By lap 15, however, Senna was all over the back of Prost&#x27;s McLaren after moving through both Williams and Benettons. He whittled down Prost&#x27;s 5 second lead to just under a second by lap 30, but the latter pulled a few seconds ahead by the 35th lap. By the end of lap 46, with 7 to go, the gap was just over a second. Senna, further back than he had been earlier in the race, made a move on Prost in the chicane before the start-finish straight. True to his word, Prost closed the gap and the two skidded into the escape road and both engines stalled. Prost jumped from his car. Senna, however, got a push from the marshals to restart his dead engine and returned to the track.

After pitting for repairs, Senna worked his way past both Williams and the Benettons to take a three-second victory. However, his altercation with Prost seven laps earlier meant he had missed the chicane and, according to FIA and FISA president Jean Marie Balestre, had not completed the lap. It is worth noting that many drivers in previous races had used the escape roads near chicanes after on-track incidents, as is customary, without receiving penalties. A penalty could have been given for restarting his stalled engine, which is technically illegal, but the stewards only considered the shortcut for the penalty. He was disqualified and Nannini revelled in his first Grand Prix victory. The new Williams FW13s of Patrese and Boutsen finished second and third, putting them five points ahead of the Ferrari team in the race for second. Piquet, Brundle and Warwick clinched the remaining point-paying positions.

McLaren went on to appeal the decision. With the matter hanging in the air, Senna went on record saying it was a plot and conspiracy against him by Balestre, who he said favoured Prost. Senna would comment again on the matter after sealing his 1991 championship, reiterating his belief that he had been unfairly treated.

===Race 16: Australia===
The final round at Adelaide saw the race run under heavy rain. Prost elected to withdraw at the end of the first lap in such torrentially wet conditions and would score no points. Senna, who considered quitting in protest of his disqualification in the previous race, was convinced to race by friends and team members. Starting from pole, by lap ten he had over 30 seconds to the Williams pair and counting. Instead of relaxing, he continued to push in poor visibility. On lap 13, he ran into the rear of Brundle&#x27;s Brabham and was out of the race. The two Williams Renaults scored a double podium finish with Boutsen winning and Patrese coming in third, Nannini finishing between them, despite Williams being a strong proponent of not starting in such conditions. The remaining points were scored by Satoru Nakajima in his single scoring-zone finish of the season, Emanuele Pirro (Benetton&#x27;s mid-season replacement for the dismissed Herbert) in the first time since Round 1 that Benetton&#x27;s points came from another driver as well as Nannini, and Martini.

The Australian Grand Prix was overshadowed by the ongoing controversy surrounding the Japanese race, but once the appeals had been considered, Prost was crowned the champion for the third time.

<text>Suha Arafat (; born Suha Daoud Tawil () on 17 July 1963) is the widow of former Palestinian National Authority president Yasser Arafat.

==Early life and education==
Suha was born in Jerusalem on 17 July 1963 into an affluent Roman Catholic family who lived in Nablus and then Ramallah (both cities under Jordanian rule at the time). Suha&#x27;s father Daoud Tawil, an Oxford-educated banker, was born in Jaffa (now part of Tel Aviv). Daoud Tawil had business both in the West Bank and Jordan.

Suha&#x27;s mother, Raymonda Hawa Tawil, born in Acre, is a member of the Hawa family of Acre, prominent property owners in the Haifa area. She was a poet and writer. She became a Palestinian political activist after 1967 and was arrested several times by the Israelis, making her a media star. She was also a high-profile Palestinian journalist. Suha, growing up in Ramallah, was influenced by the political activism of her mother conducted in the 1970s from her PLO-influenced news bureau in East Jerusalem.

Suha attended a convent school, Rosary Sisters&#x27; School, in Beit Hanina, Jerusalem. At age 18, she went to Paris to study, where she lived with her older sister, who was married to Ibrahim Souss, the PLO&#x27;s then-ambassador to France.

==Marriage to Arafat==

Soon after his departure from Paris, Arafat asked Suha to come and work with him in Tunisia (where the Palestine Liberation Organization had set up a haven). Suha secretly married Arafat on 17 July 1990, when she was aged 27 and he was 61. Their only child, daughter Zahwa, was born on 24 July 1995 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. Zahwa was named after Arafat&#x27;s mother.

Suha converted to Sunni Islam at the time of her marriage. However, many Palestinians believe her conversion to be false and allege that Suha has had millions of dollars channeled into secret bank accounts by her late husband, both of which she denies. During her marriage, she tried to leave Arafat on many occasions to escape the gossip aimed at her, but was not permitted to.

In November 1999 in a speech given in Ramallah in the presence of then First Lady Hillary Clinton, Suha Arafat falsely claimed that Israel was using poisonous gas on Palestinians &quot;which has led to an increase in cancer cases among women and children&quot;, and that Israel had contaminated 80% of Palestinian water sources with &quot;chemical materials&quot;. Suha Arafat&#x27;s claims were widely denounced as false and antisemitic, and Clinton was criticised for appearing not to swiftly reject the claims, though she criticised the claims the following day. A Palestinian official apologised &quot;for any embarrassment the first lady had suffered.&quot;

==After Arafat&#x27;s death==
Suha and Zahwa lived in Tunisia from 2004 to 2007 and obtained Tunisian citizenship in September 2006. On 7 August 2007, Tunisia, without warning Suha, revoked her citizenship but not her daughter&#x27;s. Suha claimed her Tunisian property was also frozen.

On 31 October 2011, the Tunis Court of First Instance issued an international arrest warrant for Suha, relating to corruption in a business deal that involved the former Tunisian first lady, Leila Ben Ali, in 2006. Initially, Suha proclaimed her complete cooperation with the Tunisian prosecutors but shortly thereafter she denounced the prosecution as a Tunisian scheme to defame her and the Palestinian cause. She was, at the time, living in Malta. She also denied reports that she had any money or property belonging to the Palestinian national cause, and she said that she opposed normalization of relations with Israel.

===Other activities===
On 27 November 2012, at the behest of Suha, Arafat&#x27;s body was exhumed in the West Bank, in order to have samples taken from his remains. The purpose of the exhumation, according to Suha, was to determine whether he was poisoned with polonium.
As of 2011, she was living with her daughter in Malta.

After Arafat&#x27;s death, Suha and Zahwa argued in French courts that Arafat had been murdered, possibly by poisoning. They lost their lawsuits and appeals, and in 2017 they took their case to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that the French authorities did not give their case a fair trial by refusing to include additional expert evidence. In 2021, the Court rejected their appeal as inadmissible.

<doc id="1137736" wikidata="Q636778" url="?curid=1137736" title="Principle of sufficient reason">
<text>The principle of sufficient reason states that everything must have a reason or a cause. The principle was articulated and made prominent by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, with many antecedents, and was further used and developed by Arthur Schopenhauer and William Hamilton.

== History ==
The modern formulation of the principle is usually ascribed to early Enlightenment philosopher Gottfried Leibniz. Leibniz formulated it, but was not an originator. The idea was conceived of and utilized by various philosophers who preceded him, including Anaximander, Parmenides, Archimedes, Plato and Aristotle, Cicero, Avicenna, Thomas Aquinas, and Spinoza. One often pointed to is in Anselm of Canterbury: his phrase &quot;quia Deus nihil sine ratione facit&quot; (because God does nothing without reason) and the formulation of the ontological argument for the existence of God. A clearer connection is with the cosmological argument for the existence of God. The principle can be seen in both Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham.

Notably, the post-Kantian philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer elaborated the principle, and used it as the foundation of his system. Some philosophers have associated the principle of sufficient reason with (Nothing comes from nothing). William Hamilton identified the laws of inference &quot;modus ponens&quot; with the &quot;Law of Sufficient Reason, or of Reason and Consequent&quot; and modus tollens with its contrapositive expression.

==Formulation==

The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

*For every entity &quot;X&quot;, if &quot;X&quot; exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why &quot;X&quot; exists.
*For every event &quot;E&quot;, if &quot;E&quot; occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why &quot;E&quot; occurs.
*For every proposition &quot;P&quot;, if &quot;P&quot; is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why &quot;P&quot; is true.
::formula_1

A sufficient explanation may be understood either in terms of &quot;reasons&quot; or &quot;causes,&quot; for like many philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not carefully distinguish between the two. The resulting principle is very different, however, depending on which interpretation is given (see Payne&#x27;s summary of Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;Fourfold Root&quot;).

It is an open question whether the principle of sufficient reason can be applied to axioms within a logic construction like a mathematical or a physical theory, because axioms are propositions accepted as having no justification possible within the system.
The principle declares that all propositions considered to be true within a system should be deducible from the set axioms at the base of the construction (i.e., that they ensue necessarily if we assume the system&#x27;s axioms to be true). However, Gödel has shown that for every sufficiently expressive deductive system a proposition exists that can neither be proved nor disproved (see Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems).

==Different Views==

===Leibniz&#x27;s view===
Leibniz identified two kinds of truth, necessary and contingent truths. And he claimed that all truths are based upon two principles: (1) non-contradiction, and (2) sufficient reason. In the &quot;Monadology&quot;, he says, 
Our reasonings are grounded upon two great principles, that of contradiction, in virtue of which we judge false that which involves a contradiction, and true that which is opposed or contradictory to the false;
And that of sufficient reason, in virtue of which we hold that there can be no fact real or existing, no statement true, unless there be a sufficient reason, why it should be so and not otherwise, although these reasons usually cannot be known by us (paragraphs 31 and 32).
Necessary truths can be derived from the law of identity (and the principle of non-contradiction): &quot;Necessary truths are those that can be demonstrated through an analysis of terms, so that in the end they become identities, just as in Algebra an equation expressing an identity ultimately results from the substitution of values [for variables]. That is, necessary truths depend upon the principle of contradiction.&quot; The sufficient reason for a necessary truth is that its negation is a contradiction.

Leibniz admitted contingent truths, that is, facts in the world that are not necessarily true, but that are nonetheless true. Even these contingent truths, according to Leibniz, can only exist on the basis of sufficient reasons. Since the sufficient reasons for contingent truths are largely unknown to humans, Leibniz made appeal to infinitary sufficient reasons, to which God uniquely has access:

In contingent truths, even though the predicate is in the subject, this can never be demonstrated, nor can a proposition ever be reduced to an equality or to an identity, but the resolution proceeds to infinity, God alone seeing, not the end of the resolution, of course, which does not exist, but the connection of the terms or the containment of the predicate in the subject, since he sees whatever is in the series.

Without this qualification, the principle can be seen as a description of a certain notion of closed system, in which there is no &#x27;outside&#x27; to provide unexplained events with causes. It is also in tension with the paradox of Buridan&#x27;s ass, because although the facts supposed in the paradox would present a counterexample to the claim that all contingent truths are determined by sufficient reasons, the key premise of the paradox must be rejected when one considers Leibniz&#x27;s typical infinitary conception of the world.

 In consequence of this, the case also of Buridan&#x27;s ass between two meadows, impelled equally towards both of them, is a fiction that cannot occur in the universe...For the universe cannot be halved by a plane drawn through the middle of the ass, which is cut vertically through its length, so that all is equal and alike on both sides...Neither the parts of the universe nor the viscera of the animal are alike nor are they evenly placed on both sides of this vertical plane. There will therefore always be many things in the ass and outside the ass, although they be not apparent to us, which will determine him to go on one side rather than the other. And although man is free, and the ass is not, nevertheless for the same reason it must be true that in man likewise the case of a perfect equipoise between two courses is impossible. (&quot;Theodicy&quot;, pg. 150)

Leibniz also used the principle of sufficient reason to refute the idea of absolute space:

I say then, that if space is an absolute being, there would be something for which it would be impossible there should be a sufficient reason. Which is against my axiom. And I prove it thus. Space is something absolutely uniform; and without the things placed in it, one point in space does not absolutely differ in any respect whatsoever from another point of space. Now from hence it follows, (supposing space to be something in itself, beside the order of bodies among themselves,) that &#x27;tis impossible that there should be a reason why God, preserving the same situation of bodies among themselves, should have placed them in space after one particular manner, and not otherwise; why everything was not placed the quite contrary way, for instance, by changing East into West.

===Hamilton&#x27;s fourth law: &quot;Infer nothing without ground or reason&quot;===

Here is how Hamilton, circa 1837–1838, expressed his &quot;fourth law&quot; in his LECT. V. LOGIC. 60–61:

===Schopenhauer&#x27;s Four Forms===

According to Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&quot;, there are four distinct forms of the principle.

First Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (principium rationis sufficientis fiendi); appears as the law of causality in the understanding.

Second Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (principium rationis sufficientis cognoscendi); asserts that if a judgment is to express a piece of knowledge, it must have a sufficient ground or reason, in which case it receives the predicate true.

Third Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (principium rationis sufficientis essendi); the law whereby the parts of space and time determine one another as regards those relations. Example in arithmetic: Each number presupposes the preceding numbers as grounds or reasons of its being; &quot;I can reach ten only by going through all the preceding numbers; and only by virtue of this insight into the ground of being, do I know that where there are ten, so are there eight, six, four.&quot;

&quot;Now just as the subjective correlative to the first class of representations is the understanding, that to the second the faculty of reason, and that to the third pure sensibility, so is the subjective correlative to this fourth class found to be the inner sense, or generally self-consciousness.&quot; 

Fourth Form: The Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (principium rationis sufficientis agendi); briefly known as the law of motivation. &quot;Any judgment that does not follow its previously existing ground or reason&quot; or any state that cannot be explained away as falling under the three previous headings &quot;must be produced by an act of will which has a motive.&quot; As his proposition in 43 states, &quot;Motivation is causality seen from within.&quot;

==As a law of thought==

The principle was one of the four recognised laws of thought, that held a place in European pedagogy of logic and reasoning (and, to some extent, philosophy in general) in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was influential in the thinking of Leo Tolstoy, amongst others, in the elevated form that history could not be accepted as random.

A sufficient reason is sometimes described as the coincidence of every single thing that is needed for the occurrence of an effect (i.e. of the so-called &quot;necessary conditions&quot;).

<text>The M2 flamethrower was an American, man-portable, backpack flamethrower that was used in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The M2 was the successor to the M1 and M1A1 flamethrowers. Although its burn time was around 7 seconds long, and the flames were effective around 20–40 meters, it was still a useful weapon. With the arrival of flamethrower tanks, the need for flamethrower-carrying infantrymen to expose themselves to enemy fire had been greatly reduced.

Though some M2s were sold off, the majority were scrapped.

==Combat use==
===Second World War===
The M2 flamethrower saw combat use in the Pacific theater, being deployed to combat strongly fortified and entrenched Japanese positions. Following the success with the M1 flamethrower, the M2 was developed and put into combat use in 1943. Towards the end of the conflict, later models of the M2 were equipped with the fuel-thickening agent known as napalm.

==Variants of the M2==
The M2, which was the WWII model, had hexagonal gas caps and hourglass frames. It was also called the M2-2, M2 for the tank groups and -2 for the wand type.

The M2A1-2 is the variation of the M2 devised during the Korean War. These had straight sided backpack frames, vented gas caps, a cylinder sized regulator and a safety valve. These are much more common today than WWII models.

M2A1-7 was a flamethrower used by the American troops during the Vietnam War. It is the updated version of the M2A1-2 unit used during The Korean War.

It has four controls:
* Back of the rear grip: firing safety catch.
* Front of the rear grip: firing trigger.
* On top of the front part: igniter safety catch
* Under the front part: igniter trigger.

The M9A1-7 was the most common model used in Vietnam and is much lighter and easier to use. Tanks for this weapon are commonly found, but most wands were destroyed after the Vietnam war.

Some U.S. Army flamethrowers have a front handgrip with the same shape as the rear handgrip. In these models the igniter controls are on the front handgrip, arranged in the same way as the rear handgrip controls. The M2 was replaced by the M9A1-7 flamethrower which was used in Vietnam. The M9A1-7 was replaced by the M202A1 FLASH.

<doc id="1137742" wikidata="Q3338656" url="?curid=1137742" title="Chorea-acanthocytosis">
<text>Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc, also called choreoacanthocytosis) is a rare hereditary disease --evidence suggests that only 500 to 1,000 people worldwide have the condition. It is caused by a mutation in a gene that directs structural proteins in red blood cells. It belongs to a group of four diseases characterized under the name neuroacanthocytosis. When a patient&#x27;s blood is viewed under a microscope, some of the red blood cells appear thorny. These thorny cells are called acanthocytes.

Other effects of the disease may include involuntary muscle movements, impaired balance and coordination,behavioral changes, memory problems,difficulty swallowing, speech difficulties, seizures, muscle weakness, personality changes,and neuronal degradation similar to Huntington&#x27;s disease. The average age of onset of symptoms is 35 years. The disease is incurable and inevitably leads to premature death.

Chorea-acanthocytosis is a very complex autosomal recessive adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. It often shows itself as a mixed movement disorder, in which chorea, tics, dystonia and even parkinsonism may appear as a symptom.

This disease is also characterized by the presence of a few different movement disorders including chorea, dystonia etc.

Chorea-acanthocytosis is considered an autosomal recessive disorder, although a few cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been noted.

== Signs and symptoms ==

There are multiple symptoms that can help this disease to be diagnosed, this disease is marked by the presence of acanthocytes in blood (these acanthocytes can sometimes be absent or even make a late appearance in the course of the disease.) and neurodegeneration causing a choreiform movement disorder.

Another one of them would be that this disease should be considered in patients who have elevated levels of acanthocytes in a peripheral blood film.

The serum creatine kinase is often elevated in the body of the people who are affected by this disease.

Choreoacanthocytosis patients may have a &quot;rubber man&quot; appearance with truncal instability and sudden, violent trunk spasms. Patients develop generalized chorea and a minority of Choreoacanthocytosis patients develops Parkinsonism.

In a least one third of patients, seizures, typically generalized, are the first manifestation of disease. Impairment of memory and executive functions is frequent, although not invariable.

People afflicted by this disease also experience a loss of neurons. Loss of neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the generally non-regenerative nature of neuronal cells in the adult central nervous system, this results in an irreversible and fatal process of neurodegeneration. There is also the presence of several movement related disorders including chorea, dystonia and bradykinesia, one of the more incapacitating ones includes Truncal spasms. 

== Cause ==
Choreo-acanthocytosis is caused by a mutation in both copies of the gene &quot;VPS13A&quot;, which codes for vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A.

== Diagnosis ==

Protein function tests that demonstrate a reduce in chorein levels and also genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis given to a patient. For a disease like this it is often necessary to sample the blood of the patient on multiple occasions with a specific request given to the haematologist to examine the film for acanthocytes. Another point is that the diagnosis of the disease can be confirmed by the absence of chorein in the western blot of the erythrocyte membranes.

== Treatment ==

The treatment to battle the disease chorea-acanthocytosis is completely symptomatic. For example, botulinum toxin injections can help to control orolingual dystonia.
Deep brain stimulation is a treatment that has varied effects on the people suffering from the symptoms of this disease, for some it has helped in a large way and for other people it did not help whatsoever, it is more effective on specific symptoms of the disease. Patients with chorea-acanthocytosis should undergo a cardiac evaluation every five years to look for cardiomyopathy.

<text>Socialist Action is a small Trotskyist group in the United Kingdom. From the mid-1980s Socialist Action became an entryist organisation, attempting to work within other organisations, with members using code names and not revealing their affiliation. It maintains a website but no publicly visible formal organisation.

The organisation was linked with the 2000–2008 Greater London mayoral administrations of Ken Livingstone, although Livingstone was never a member. Four of Livingstone&#x27;s key advisers were Socialist Action members; all made the &quot;top 25&quot; in the &quot;Evening Standard&#x27;s&quot; 2007 list of the most influential people in London. Its members have maintained leading positions in many campaigns - the National Abortion Campaign, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, National Assembly Against Racism and various coalitions against the wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, for example. As a result, &quot;Socialist Action&quot; exert an influence beyond that which might be expected from so small a grouping.

== History ==
The group was founded in 1982 when the International Marxist Group entered the Labour Party and changed its name to the Socialist League. It became generally known by the name of its publication, &quot;Socialist Action&quot;, which first appeared on 16 March 1983. The group organised around the newspaper, but also had a bookshop The Other Bookshop, in Islington, as well as a printing press, Lithoprint Ltd, in Stoke Newington, which it still owns.

In September 1983, assuming that the Labour Party&#x27;s actions against the Militant group would extend to Socialist Action as well, the group decided to disappear from public view, closing down the bookshop, and taking other measures to guarantee invisibility. Members were assigned pen names, and after the closure of the bookshop met in an assortment of pubs. The group adopted an entryist strategy &quot;to protect members from any potential Militant-style purge&quot;.

By the mid-1980s, the group had around 500 members. Working with increasing secrecy in the Labour Party, often under the auspices of other apparently independent organisations, its members became supporters of Ken Livingstone and the Campaign Group of Labour MPs.

The group&#x27;s character changed in a wave of splits in the mid-1980s, beginning in 1985 when a minority, led by Phil Hearse, Dave Packer, Davy Jones, and Jane Kelly formed the International Group, whose members were recognised by the International as remaining individual members. In 1987 the International Group merged with the Socialist Group to form the International Socialist Group and publish &quot;Socialist Outlook&quot;. The remaining majority of the Socialist League consisted of two currents. One, led by Brian Grogan, was part of the Pathfinder tendency led by the Socialist Workers Party (United States). The Grogan current was expelled by the Central Committee led by John Ross, and became the Communist League (UK, 1988).

The remainder of the group drew pessimistic conclusions from the fall of the Stalinist regimes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It continued to define itself as a Trotskyist group. It considers the Soviet model to have been preferable to capitalism for the working class, but it has always criticised that model for its bureaucratic and undemocratic features, accepting Trotsky&#x27;s definition of the USSR as a degenerated workers&#x27; state. Socialist Action participated in the 1989 and 1990 Fourth International Youth Summer Camps but suffered another split after the 1991 World Congress. Small groups of Socialist Action members regularly resigned and joined the International Group, and its successor, the International Socialist Group, between the original split in 1985 and the 1991. At the 1991 World Congress of the Fourth International, the group was given equal status within the International with the International Socialist Group. At the 1995 world congress the ISG replaced Socialist Action as the British section.

In 1997, along with Labour Party activist Ken Livingstone, SA backed &quot;Morning Star&quot; chief executive Mary Rosser and committee member Kumar Murshid in a battle for control over the newspaper.

In 2001, SA stopped publishing its journal, also named &quot;Socialist Action&quot;, but continued to organise as a faction, for instance as the Student Broad Left. In 2003, it played a major role in backing Kate Hudson&#x27;s leadership of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), and a long-term CND officer alleged that, along with the Communist Party of Britain, it was becoming dominant in the organisation, in order to exert influence over the Stop The War Coalition. Some of its activists played leading roles in organising the 2004 European Social Forum.

Socialist Action was heavily involved in the publication and editorial control of &quot;Socialist Campaign Group News&quot;.

===Ken Livingstone===
The group&#x27;s association with Ken Livingstone goes back to 1985, when the group&#x27;s leader, John Ross, became Livingstone&#x27;s economic advisor. In the mid-1980s the group adopted Livingstone as something of a figurehead, regarding Arthur Scargill and Tony Benn as spent forces, and according to Atma Singh was &quot;instrumental&quot; in getting Livingstone elected to the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee in 1987 and 1988.

Running as an independent candidate for Mayor in 2000, Livingstone&#x27;s decision to appoint members of Socialist Action to his administration during his first term drew criticism in the media. When Livingstone re-appointed his administration in 2004, members of Socialist Action were described as his &quot;stooges&quot;. In a January 2008 article that was subsequently spun as revealing a &quot;secret Marxist cell&quot; at the GLA, Atma Singh, a former member of SA who had been Policy Advisor on Asian Affairs to Ken Livingstone from 2001 to 2007, detailed some of the history and activities of Socialist Action, accusing members of planning a &quot;bourgeois democratic revolution&quot;, trying to accumulate power and manipulating the Mayor. A subsequent episode of the Channel 4 documentary series &quot;Dispatches&quot;, &quot;The Court of Ken&quot;, presented by journalist Martin Bright, featured Singh and others making these same allegations. The advisers named, including chief of staff Simon Fletcher, deputy chief of staff and director of public affairs and transport Redmond O&#x27;Neill, economic adviser John Ross, green adviser Mark Watts and culture adviser Jude Woodward, refused to state whether or not they are still active as Socialist Action, and a spokesman for Livingstone responded to the charges by referring to Singh&#x27;s removal from his job for &quot;failure to discharge his duties&quot; and calling Singh &quot;an embittered ex-employee&quot;. Livingstone referred to the claims in the &quot;Dispatches&quot; documentary as a hatchet job. Later, Livingstone said “Almost all of my advisers had been involved in Socialist Action... It was the only rational left-wing group you could engage with. They used to produce my socialist economic policies. It was not a secret group.”

In 2007 Livingstone changed the GLA rules so that his eight key advisers, four associated with SA (including John Ross and the late Redmond O&#x27;Neill), who as temporary appointments would not normally have been entitled to severance pay, received an average of £200,000 each.

=== After 2007 ===
Socialist Action also participated in Respect - The Unity Coalition after the 2007 split in that party. Several of its supporters became members of the party and one served as its national treasurer. In 2009, its members played leading roles in the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. In 2012, rival Trotskyist group Alliance for Workers Liberty say that it dominated Unite Against Fascism as a junior partner to the Socialist Workers Party.

Its members continue to publish occasional pamphlets and leaflets. It relaunched its website, with an analysis of the world economic situation following the Great Recession. The group applies the Marxist concept of the organic composition of capital to argue that the US economy is in a long-term decline and in turn the non-capitalist character of China is helping it to emerge from the crisis.

==== Jeremy Corbyn ====
Following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as Labour Party leader and Leader of the Opposition in 2015, many of its leading members became active in the party leadership. Former member Atma Singh said that Socialist Action were building &quot;a real power base&quot; around Corbyn and Simon Fletcher - who according to Singh had been on the SA central committee - was appointed Corbyn&#x27;s Chief of Staff (having previously been appointed Labour&#x27;s trade union liaison manager by Ed Miliband in 2013) while John Ross has been linked to Corbyn&#x27;s inner circle. Fletcher resigned from his role in early 2017.

<text>Subconjunctival bleeding, also known as subconjunctival hemorrhage or subconjunctival haemorrhage, is bleeding from a small blood vessel over the whites of the eye. It results in a red spot in the white of the eye. There is generally little to no pain and vision is not affected. Generally only one eye is affected.
Causes can include coughing, vomiting, heavy lifting, straining during acute constipation or the act of &quot;bearing down&quot; during childbirth, as these activities can increase the blood pressure in the vascular systems supplying the conjunctiva. Other causes include blunt or penetrating trauma to the eye. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, old age, and blood thinners. Subconjunctival bleeding occurs in about 2% of newborns following a vaginal delivery. The blood accumulates between the conjunctiva and the episclera. Diagnosis is generally based on the appearance of the conjunctiva.
The condition is relatively common, and both sexes are affected equally. Spontaneous bleeding occurs more commonly over the age of 50 while the traumatic type occurs more often in young males. Generally no specific treatment is required and the condition resolves over two to three weeks. Artificial tears may be used to alleviate irritation.

==Signs and symptoms==
Subconjunctival bleeding initially appears bright red underneath the transparent bulbar conjunctiva. Later, the bleeding may spread and become green or yellow as the hemoglobin is metabolized. It usually disappears within two weeks. The affected eye may feel dry, rough, or scratchy, but the condition is not usually painful.

==Causes==
*Mechanical
**Increased venous pressure (e.g. extreme g-force, straining, vomiting, choking, sneezing, coughing or strangling) or from straining due to constipation
**External pressure changes:
***Atmospheric pressure changes due to aircraft altitude changes
***Mask squeeze from scuba diving without equalizing mask pressure during descent
**Eye injury or eye surgery
**Zygoma fracture (results in lateral subconjunctival bleeding)
*Medical conditions that affect blood or blood vessels:
**Severe hypertension
**Viral hemorrhagic fever
**Coagulation disorder (congenital or acquired)
**Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (caused by including enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24 variant, and adenovirus 11)
**Leptospirosis

Subconjunctival bleeding in infants may be associated with scurvy (a vitamin C deficiency),
abuse or traumatic asphyxia syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by visual inspection, by noting the typical finding of bright red discoloration confined to the white portion (sclera) of the eye. In rare cases blood may drip from the eye.

==Management==
A subconjunctival bleeding is typically a self-limiting condition that requires no treatment unless there is evidence of an eye infection or there has been significant eye trauma. Artificial tears may be applied four to six times a day if the eye feels dry or scratchy. The elective use of aspirin is typically discouraged.
