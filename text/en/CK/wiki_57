<text>John Patrick Shanley (born October 13, 1950) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and director. He won the 1988 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film &quot;Moonstruck&quot;. His play, &quot;&quot;, won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the 2005 Tony Award for Best Play; he wrote and directed the film adaptation and earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Early life and education==
Shanley was born into an Irish-American family in The Bronx, New York City. His mother worked as a telephone operator, and his father was a meat-packer. The neighborhood Shanley grew up in was considered very rough.

Shanley&#x27;s academic career did not begin well, but ultimately he graduated from New York University with honors from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. In his program bio for the Broadway production of &quot;&quot;, he mentions that he was &quot;thrown out of St. Helena&#x27;s kindergarten, banned from St. Anthony&#x27;s hot lunch program and expelled from Cardinal Spellman High School.&quot; He was heavily influenced by one of his first teachers, Sister Margaret McEntee, on whom he based the character of Sister James in his play, &quot;Doubt&quot;. While at Cardinal Spellman High School, he saw two school productions that influenced him: &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;.

After his freshman year at New York University, Shanley was put on academic probation. He then enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, serving in a stateside post during the Vietnam War. Following his military service, he wrote a novel, then burned it, and returned to the university with the help of the G.I. Bill, and by supporting himself with a series of jobs: elevator operator, house painter, furniture mover, locksmith, bartender. He graduated from New York University as valedictorian in 1977, with a degree in Educational Theatre, and is a member of the Ensemble Studio Theatre.

==Career==
Shanley is the author of more than 23 plays, which have been translated and performed around the world, including 80 productions a year in North America. He has often directed his own productions.

He has also written for film; his second film, &quot;Moonstruck&quot; (1987), stars Nicolas Cage and Cher, and won three Academy Awards, including one for his screenplay. In 1990, Shanley directed his script of &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano.&quot; Shanley also wrote two songs for the movie: &quot;Marooned Without You&quot; and &quot;The Cowboy Song.&quot; He wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Congo&quot; (1995), which was based on the Michael Crichton book.

His play &quot;&quot; ran on Broadway from March 31, 2005, to July 2, 2006, and won four 2005 Tony Awards (including Best Play), the Drama Desk Award (including Outstanding Play) and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Shanley wrote and directed the 2008 film version, which starred Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis. The screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. &quot;Doubt: A Parable&quot;, is featured in &quot;The Fourth Wall&quot;, a book of photographs by Amy Arbus for which Shanley also wrote the foreword.

In 2012, Shanley wrote the libretto for an opera version of &quot;&quot;, which premiered at the Minnesota Opera in January 2013, with music by Douglas J. Cuomo. Until then, his experience with opera was not extensive; he had attended a few performances and had listened to recordings. As he worked on the libretto, using many lines that come directly from the play, he describes that his enthusiasm for the form grew. Also in 2012, his play &quot;Storefront Church&quot; ran Off-Broadway in a production by the Atlantic Theater Company. The play concerns Bronx residents &quot;whose lives become tangled in unexpected ways when a mortgage goes sour&quot;. Storefront Church was also put up by San Francisco Playhouse in San Francisco in December 2013 where it was very well received.

His play, &quot;Outside Mullingar&quot;, opened on Broadway at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre, produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club, on January 3, 2014 (in previews) and officially on January 23, 2014. The play was directed by Doug Hughes and starred Debra Messing and Brían F. O&#x27;Byrne. The play is set in the Irish countryside. In 2020, a film adaptation of the play was released, entitled Wild Mountain Thyme.

&quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, which he directed, was produced Off-Broadway by the Manhattan Theatre Club. It opened on February 9, 2016, and featured Timothée Chalamet, Robert Sean Leonard, Annika Boras, Chris McGarry and David Potters. The play concerns a lonely teen from The Bronx who attends a private school in New Hampshire. His play &quot;The Portuguese Kid&quot; opened on October 24, 2017, at the New York City Center Stage I, produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club. Directed by Shanley, the cast featured Jason Alexander, Sherie Rene Scott, Mary Testa, Aimee Carrero and Pico Alexander. His new play Brooklyn Laundry opened on February 6, 2024, at the Manhattan Theatre Club. Shanley directed, with a cast featuring Cecily Strong, David Zayas, Florencia Lozano, and Andrea Syglowski.

==Personal life==

<doc id="1135490" wikidata="Q7721149" url="?curid=1135490" title="The Canadian Sweethearts">
<text>The Canadian Sweethearts, sometimes known as Bob &amp; Lucille, were a Canadian singing duo who were popular during the 1960s, disbanding in 1977. The duo consisted of vocalist Lucille Starr and her guitar-playing husband, Bob Regan. They are best known for the rockabilly song, &quot;Eeny Meeny Miney Moe&quot;. Their contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

==History==
Regan was born Robert Frederickson on March 13, 1931, in Rolla, British Columbia. As a child he played harmonica, guitar, mandolin and fiddle. Starr was born Lucille Marie Raymonde Savoie on May 13, 1938, in St. Boniface, Manitoba. In 1958, Regan had been performing in his brother Keray&#x27;s band, The Peace Rangers, and had recorded a single, &quot;Teenage Boogie&quot;/&quot;I Will Never Hold Another&quot;, singing a duet with his sister Fern on the B-side. Starr had performed in the French band Les Hirondelles and later as a solo singer. They met at a wedding and began performing together. They soon married and began to perform and record in Canada, calling themselves &quot;Bob and Lucille&quot;. Their first recording was the 1958 single &quot;Eeny-Meeny-Miney-Moe&quot;, released by Ditto, a small recording studio in Hollywood, California. A second single, &quot;The Big Kiss&quot;/&quot;What&#x27;s the Password&quot;, was also released by Ditto.

At this point, they started billing themselves as &quot;The Canadian Sweethearts&quot; and, in 1961, released a single, &quot;No Help Wanted&quot;, with Soma. They performed and toured in the US and Canada. In 1963, they signed with A&amp;M Records and released two albums and a number of singles, including &quot;Out For Fun&quot;/&quot;Freight Train&quot;. None were commercially successful in the US, although three were near the top of the Canadian charts. In 1964, Starr recorded &quot;The French Song&quot;, singing solo and backed by the Tijuana Brass, the label co-owner Herb Alpert&#x27;s band. The single was a hit in Europe and was also popular in Canada where is reached #12.

The Canadian Sweethearts appeared on various television programs, including regular appearances on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Country America&quot; show, and toured with Hank Snow.

In 1966, they signed with Epic Records in Nashville, Tennessee, releasing a series of singles, some of which appeared briefly in the charts. The next year, they divorced but continued to perform and record together until 1977. They went on to perform separately.

Regan died on March 5, 1990. Starr died on September 4, 2020.

<text>Lucille Marie Raymonde Savoie (May 13, 1938September 4, 2020), known professionally as Lucille Starr, was a Canadian singer, songwriter, and yodeler originally from Saint Boniface, Manitoba. She was best known for her 1964 hit single, &quot;The French Song&quot; (&quot;Quand Le Soleil Dit Bonjour Aux Montagnes&quot;, When the sun says hello to the mountains).

==Early life==
Starr was born in the Franco-Manitoban community of Saint Boniface to a musical family. During her childhood years in Saint Boniface, she first sang in church. When Starr was seven the family moved to Maillardville, a Francophone community in Coquitlam, British Columbia, where she learned to play guitar, bass and mandolin.

==Career==
Savoie started her musical career with the local group Les Hirondelles. She met and married country singer Bob Regan (born Robert Frederickson), and, using the stage name Lucille Starr, she began performing with him as a country singing duo called &quot;Bob &amp; Lucille&quot;. Between 1958 and 1963 they released several 45 rpm records that were mainly covers of an eclectic mix of fashionable country, pop, rockabilly and folk songs of people such as Perry Como to Connie Francis. Their records met with modest success on the North American West Coast and in 1963 they were signed by A&amp;M Records in Los Angeles, California, with which they began recording as &quot;The Canadian Sweethearts&quot;.

At A&amp;M Records, Starr recorded a song called &quot;The French Song&quot; that was produced by Herb Alpert. This name was chosen because Alpert could not pronounce the original French title &quot;Quand le soleil dit bonjour aux montagnes&quot; (When the sun says Good day to the mountains). It was recorded in a bilingual version with French lyrics in the first half followed by the English translation in the second half. In 1964, at a time when The Beatles dominated the music charts, &quot;The French Song&quot; was an international success that made Starr the first Canadian artist to have a record sell over a million copies. The popularity of the song led to a tour of the United States and appearing on the Louisiana Hayride radio show and on Chicago radio station WLS (AM) popular National Barn Dance. Starr also sang on American television musical variety shows such as &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, followed by tours of Pacific Rim countries, Australia, South Africa, and across Europe where she became a particular favorite in the Netherlands. The song sold over one million copies, and it was awarded a gold disc.

In 1967, Starr and her Canadian Sweethearts duo signed a recording contract with Epic Records in Nashville, Tennessee. Divorced from her first husband, their musical collaboration ended in 1977. Although she never again had a hit of the magnitude of &quot;The French Song&quot;, Starr enjoyed a long and prosperous career recording primarily in English but also in French and Spanish. For the most part she sang country music, becoming the first female inducted into the Canadian Country Music Association’s &quot;Hall of Honor&quot; in 1987. A capable yodeler, she was hired to do the yodeling for the &quot;Cousin Pearl&quot; character on several segments of the hit TV series, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

&quot;Back to You: the Life and Music of Lucille Starr&quot;, a jukebox musical with a script by Tracey Power, was performed at the Prairie Theatre Exchange in Winnipeg in November 2010.

In her honour, a street in the city of Coquitlam was named &quot;Lucille Starr Way&quot;.

==Death==
Starr died in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the early morning hours of September 4, 2020. The announcement of her death was made on Facebook by fellow Canadian artist, Joyce Smith.

Lucille&#x27;s second husband Bryan Cunningham died October 2, 2023. She is survived by her son Robert Frederickson, stepdaughter Shannon Cunningham and stepson David Cunningham.

<doc id="1135519" wikidata="Q604235" url="?curid=1135519" title="Earle Nelson">
<text>Earle Leonard Nelson ( Ferral; May 12, 1897January 13, 1928), also known in the media as the Gorilla Man, the Gorilla Killer, and the Dark Strangler, was an American serial killer, rapist, and necrophile, who is considered the first known serial sex murderer of the twentieth century. Born and raised in San Francisco, California by his devoutly Pentecostal grandmother, Nelson exhibited bizarre behavior as a child, which was compounded by head injuries he sustained in a bicycling accident at age 10. After committing various minor offenses in early adulthood, he was institutionalized in Napa for a time.

Nelson began committing numerous rapes and murders in February 1926, primarily in the West Coast cities of San Francisco and Portland, Oregon. In late 1926 he moved east, committing multiple rapes and murders in several Midwestern and East Coast cities before moving north into Canada, raping and killing a teenage girl in Winnipeg, Manitoba. After committing his second murder in Winnipeg, he was arrested by Canadian authorities, convicted of his final murder only - that of Emily Patterson - and sentenced to death. Nelson was executed by hanging in Winnipeg in 1928.

In undertaking his crimes, Nelson had a &quot;modus operandi&quot;: Most of his victims were middle-aged landladies, many of whom he would find through &quot;room for rent&quot; advertisements. Posing as a mild-mannered and charming Christian drifter, Nelson used the pretext of renting a room in the landladies&#x27; boarding houses to make contact with them before attacking. Each of his victims were killed via strangulation, and many were raped after death. His penultimate victim, a 13-year-old girl named Lola Cowan, was one of three victims to be significantly mutilated after death.

Nelson&#x27;s crime spree is believed, through recent research, to have included 22 murders and 22 other attacks. He was a source of inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1943 film &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;.

==Early life==
Earle Nelson was born Earle Leonard Ferral on May 12, 1897, in San Francisco, California, the son of an Iowa-born mother of Danish and Irish descent, Frances Nelson, and a father whose ancestry was Jewish, James Carlos Ferral. Both of his parents died of syphilis before he reached two years of age. Nelson was subsequently sent to live with his maternal grandmother Jennie Nelson, a devout Pentecostal who raised him alongside her two younger children, Willis and Lillian, who were ten and eight years his senior, respectively. Nelson exhibited self-loathing and other &quot;morbid&quot; behavior at a young age, and was expelled from the Agassiz primary school in San Francisco at age 7. Around age 10, he collided with a streetcar while riding his bicycle and remained unconscious for six days. After he awoke, Nelson&#x27;s behavior became erratic, and he suffered from frequent headaches and memory loss.

Described as a &quot;psychotic prodigy,&quot; Nelson exhibited increasingly bizarre, manic behaviors in his childhood, such as talking to invisible people, compulsively quoting Biblical passages, and watching female family members undress. His grandmother noted occasions where Nelson would embark to school in freshly-cleaned clothes and return home in rags, as though he had exchanged clothes with a homeless person. Nelson&#x27;s strong religious upbringing remained a pervasive influence in his life, and he obsessively read the Book of Revelation as a teenager.

In his early teenage years, Nelson began frequenting brothels and bars in San Francisco&#x27;s Barbary Coast red-light district, and contracted a venereal disease. As he progressed through puberty, Nelson grew into a stocky, physically fit young man. He would sometimes entertain his family with his physical talents, such as walking on his hands or lifting heavy objects with his teeth.

==Crimes==
===Early offenses; institutionalization===
Nelson began his criminal activities at a young age, and was sentenced to two years in San Quentin State Prison in 1915 after breaking into a cabin in rural Plumas County, which he believed had been abandoned. He was paroled for this offense on September 6, 1916, but was arrested again in Stockton on March 9, 1917, for petty larceny. Nelson spent another six months incarcerated before being discharged, after which he was arrested in Los Angeles for burglary charges. After spending approximately five months in Los Angeles County Jail, Nelson escaped. 

Sometime in late-1917, Nelson enlisted in the U.S. military, but deserted after six weeks. He repeated this pattern on several occasions, enlisting in different military branches under different names before deserting. In 1918, Nelson was committed to the Napa State Mental Hospital after behaving oddly and erratically during one of his brief stints in the United States Navy. A Navy psychologist noted that Nelson was &quot;living in a constitutional psychotic state.&quot;
Upon his arrival at Napa State Mental Hospital, a psychologist who observed Nelson on May 21, 1918, noted that he did not appear &quot;violent, homicidal, or destructive.&quot; William Pritchard, a psychiatrist who conducted a preliminary interview with him, noted that Nelson spoke of hallucinations and other paranoid delusions: &quot;He has seen faces, heard music, and at times believed people were poisoning him. Voices sometimes whisper to him to kill himself. Says that if he were kept in jail, he would get something sharp and cut the veins in his wrists.&quot; Pritchard also indicated that Nelson had experienced occipital headaches, fainted several times, and felt dizzy during their interactions. 

During his institutionalization, Nelson managed to escape at least three times before staff eventually stopped trying to locate him. His frequent escapes earned him the nickname &quot;Houdini&quot; among the hospital&#x27;s employees. Nelson was formally discharged from the Navy &quot;in absentia&quot; on May 17, 1919, and his file with the hospital was closed with a note indicating he had &quot;improved.&quot;

Nelson subsequently acquired a job working as a janitor at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, using the pseudonym &quot;Evan Louis Fuller.&quot; There, he met 60-year-old Mary Martin, an administrative worker. The two began to date, and were married in August 1919. Their marriage, however, was short-lived, as Nelson &quot;made her life a living hell&quot; with his jealous rages, bizarre sexual demands, religious delusions, and increasingly violent behavior, leading her to separate from him after cohabiting for only six months. Martin would later recall various bizarre behaviors she witnessed while living with Nelson, which included protracted disappearances from their home and unusual bathing practices that entailed him pouring glasses of water over his toes.

On May 19, 1921, Nelson posed as a plumber to enter the residence at 1519 Pacific Avenue in San Francisco and attempted to molest 12-year-old resident Mary Summers in the basement. His attempt was thwarted when she screamed and attracted help from her nine-year-old brother. Nelson fled, but was captured hours later while riding a trolley. At a competency hearing, he was deemed dangerous and recommitted to Napa State Mental Hospital. He would escape again on two occasions before being discharged from the institution in 1925.

===Murder spree===
====FebruaryNovember 1926: California, Portland, and Seattle====

Nelson began his killing spree early in 1926. His first known victim was Clara Newman, a wealthy 60-year-old San Francisco landlady. Nelson entered her boardinghouse at 2037 Pierce Street on February 20, 1926, posing as a potential tenant named &quot;Roger Wilson.&quot; Sometime after entering the home, Nelson strangled Newman before raping her dead body and hiding her corpse in a vacant apartment in the house. His second victim, 63-year-old Laura Beale, was strangled in her home in nearby San Jose on March 2. The silken cord that had been used to strangle Beale had reportedly been wound so tightly around her neck that it had embedded in her flesh.

Nelson strangled and raped 63-year-old Lillian St. Mary, also in San Francisco, on June 26, 1926. Exactly two weeks later, south in Santa Barbara, 53-year-old Ollie Russell was strangled with a cord in her boardinghouse. An autopsy confirmed that Russell had been sexually assaulted after death, and the similarities in the &quot;modus operandi&quot; between her murder and the San Francisco area slayings led police to assume they were connected. On August 16, 52-year-old Mary Nisbet, an apartment building proprietor in Oakland, was found by her husband, strangled to death and raped in the bathroom of a vacant apartment. 

Initially, local law enforcement questioned Nisbet&#x27;s husband in her death, but he was shortly cleared of suspicion. Witnesses later told police they had seen a &quot;smiling stranger&quot; lurking outside Nisbet&#x27;s apartment building the day of her murder. Others who claimed to have seen Nelson at the various boarding houses described him to police as a dark and stocky man with &quot;long arms and large hands.&quot; Because of this, newspapers began referring to him as the &quot;Dark Strangler,&quot; the &quot;Gorilla Man,&quot; or &quot;Gorilla Killer.&quot;
In the fall of 1926, Nelson relocated to Portland, Oregon, where he raped and murdered 35-year-old landlady Beata Withers on October 19, her body found by her teenage son, stuffed beneath clothing inside a steamer trunk in the attic of her home. The following day, 59-year-old Virginia Grant was murdered in a vacant property she owned on East 22nd Street, her body hidden behind the home&#x27;s basement furnace. On October 21, landlady Mabel Fluke disappeared from her home in Portland; her body was discovered several days later in the attic, strangled with a scarf. Despite the subsequent similar murders of Grant and Fluke, a coroner&#x27;s jury of four men and three women was appointed on October 28 to evaluate the &quot;mysterious&quot; death of Withers. The jury&#x27;s decision was split in half, with three believing her death was a suicide and the other three believing it murder.

After committing the three murders in Portland, Nelson briefly returned to San Francisco, where he raped and murdered 56-year-old widow Anna Edmonds on November 18. Initially, police were hesitant to attribute the crime to the &quot;Dark Strangler&quot;; however, several days after her murder, a friend of Edmonds told police she had stopped by her home on the day of her murder and found Edmonds talking to a &quot;strange man&quot; in her parlor about a business deal that involved her selling her house. The woman&#x27;s descriptions of the unknown man matched those of the &quot;Dark Strangler.&quot; 

The following day, November 19, in nearby Burlingame, California, a 28-year-old pregnant woman was attacked while showing her home to a man posing as a potential buyer. She survived the attack, and described the man as being around tall, well-dressed and well-spoken. The woman later told reporters that, though she hadn&#x27;t felt threatened initially, she realized in retrospect that, peculiarly, the man had commented on the home&#x27;s intricate details, particularly the ceilings: &quot;I realize now that he was trying to get me to look up towards the ceiling, so that he could get behind me and grab my throat,&quot; she said.

Ten days later, on November 29, Nelson murdered and raped Blanche Myers in her Portland home. Police were able to recover foreign fingerprints from Myers&#x27; iron bedpost. The Portland murders ignited a public frenzy, and &quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported that the third floor of the Portland Police Bureau had become &quot;a veritable madhouse,&quot; with clerks taking hundreds of phone calls and reports of &quot;suspicious characters.&quot; 

One local woman called police, claiming that a suspicious man had stayed in her boardinghouse for several days after the Thanksgiving holiday, using the name &quot;Adrian Harris.&quot; On November 29, the day of Myers&#x27; murder, she stated the man told her and other residents that he was leaving to take a train to Vancouver, Washington, and had indicated that he would not be returning. She found this suspicious, given that he had paid multiple days&#x27; worth of rent in advance. Before departing, he gave her and another female boarder pieces of jewelry as a gift, which were later confirmed by police to have been owned by Florence Monks, a wealthy widow who had been murdered and raped in her Seattle home on November 23.

In hopes of preventing further murders, law enforcement in California and Oregon issued public safety announcements to citizens; in the San Francisco Bay area, elderly women were advised to take precautions while renting rooms and inviting strangers into their homes. Meanwhile, the Portland Police Bureau issued the following statement to the public: &quot;Do not show your houses or rooms for rent while alone. If necessary, call a policeman to accompany you. Crimes such as these should be prevented and could have been prevented if women had been more careful. I do not wish to unduly alarm the people of Portland. But there is no denying the situation is grave.&quot;

====December 1926April 1927: Midwest and East Coast====

After leaving Portland in late November 1926, Nelson moved eastward, hitchhiking or stowing away on trains. On December 23, the body of Almira Berard, 41, was found inside her Council Bluffs, Iowa, home; she had been garroted with a shirt. Initially, local police presumed her death a suicide, as Brerard had recently been discharged from a psychiatric institution. This was dismissed after it was discovered that she had been raped. 

Two days after Christmas, 23-year-old Bonnie Pace of Kansas City, Missouri, was strangled to death and raped in her home, her body discovered in an upstairs room by her husband. On December 28, Germania Harpin, age 28, along with her eight-month-old infant son Robert, was found murdered in her Kansas City home. Both had been strangledRobert, with a diaperand Germania had been raped after death. Both she and Robert were discovered by her husband when he returned from work that evening.

Nelson continued to move further east, murdering and raping 53-year-old landlady Mary McConnell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on April 27. Several articles of jewelry were also stolen from McConnell&#x27;s residence. The following day, Nelson attempted to sell one of McConnell&#x27;s gold watches to pawn shop owner Marie Kuhn, but she declined. One month later, on May 27, Nelson arrived in Buffalo, New York, where he rented a room from 53-year-old Jennie Randolph, using the name &quot;Charles Harrison.&quot; Three days later, Randolph was discovered strangled to death and raped, her body stuffed under a bed in her home. Randolph&#x27;s brother, Gideon Gillett, had met &quot;Mr. Harrison&quot; when he first arrived at the residence, and described him as &quot;about thirty-three years old, with a stocky build, dark complexion, and black hair slicked straight back.&quot; Fred Merritt, a boarder in Randolph&#x27;s house, would later positively identify Nelson as &quot;Charles Harrison.&quot;

On June 1 in Detroit, Michigan, boardinghouse manager Fannie May, along with boarder Maureen Atorthy, were discovered murdered in the boardinghouse that May oversaw. Their bodies were found by the building owner, Leonard Sink, who had arrived to collect rent funds from May. May had been garrotted with an electrical cord cut from a table lamp. Police determined that the cord had been cut while the electric current was still circulating, and that the knife with which it had been done would show visible burning as well as a nicked blade. Two days later, Nelson murdered 27-year-old Mary Cecilia Sietsma in Chicago, Illinois. Sietsma was discovered by her husband on the floor of their home, strangled with an appliance cord. Several articles of men&#x27;s clothing were also stolen from the home.

====MayJune 1927: Canada; final crimes====
On June 8, 1927, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, 14-year-old Lola Cowan disappeared after leaving her home to sell artificial flowers door-to-door. On June 10, another local woman, Emily Patterson, went missing. She was discovered later that evening by her husband, raped and strangled to death under her son&#x27;s bed. She had also been bludgeoned with a claw hammer. Patterson&#x27;s husband discovered her body while kneeling at the bedside to say evening prayers. 

Upon investigation, police determined that several items were missing from the Patterson home, including a whipcord suit, Patterson&#x27;s gold wedding ring, the family Bible, and C$70 in ten-dollar bills. A knife bearing burn marks and nicks was also left behind in the home. Police found the knife to be consistent with that which had cut the lamp cord used in the May and Artorthy murders the week prior.

The day after Patterson&#x27;s murder, Fred England, a local jeweler in Winnipeg, unknowingly purchased Patterson&#x27;s wedding ring from Nelson for C$3.50, and clothing stolen from the home was subsequently discovered for sale in a local secondhand store. Both the jeweler and clothing store owner would positively identify Nelson as the man who provided them the ring and clothing. Nicholas Tabor, a barber who owned a shop next door to the secondhand store, told police he had given a man resembling Nelson a shave, haircut, and massage on the afternoon of June 10. While cutting the man&#x27;s hair, Tabor noticed dried blood on his scalp, as well as scratch marks. When he inquired about them, the man reportedly became agitated and requested that Tabor not touch them.

While performing a citywide search of boarding houses in Winnipeg on June 12, police entered the boarding house of Mrs. August Hill on 133 Smith Street, where Nelson had recently lodged. Upon a search of his room, the decaying, nude corpse of Cowan was discovered under the bed. Cowan&#x27;s body, unlike that of his other victims, had reportedly been mutilated in a manner &quot;reminiscent of [the victims of] Jack the Ripper.&quot; Her clothing and belongings were missing and it was evident the bed had not been slept in, leading police to determine that Nelson had spent the night sleeping with the body beneath the bed. 

After the discovery of Cowan&#x27;s body, Winnipeg City Council posted a C$1,500 reward for information leading to the &quot;conviction of the criminal degenerate&quot; responsible. This reward would subsequently become a point of dispute after several individuals came forward with information pertaining to Nelson&#x27;s whereabouts. Among them was a motorist who claimed to have given Nelson a ride from Emerson to Winnipeg on the day Cowan went missing.

==Capture==
Assuming that Nelson had fled to the United States, Canadian police sent descriptions of him to all U.S. police stations and post offices. In the intervening days, sightings of Nelson were reported in Regina, Saskatchewan, and Boissevain, Manitoba. A man matching Nelson&#x27;s description who gave his name as &quot;Mike Mowski&quot; was arrested on June 14 in the Manitoba/Minnesota border town of Warroad by Customs Officers, but he escaped the next day. On June 16, 1927, constables in Killarney, a Manitoba border town from the North Dakota border, arrested a man named &quot;Virgil Wilson&quot; who fit Nelson&#x27;s description. His demeanor was reportedly so calm and cooperative that the constables assumed they had the wrong individual. 

&quot;Wilson&quot; was incarcerated in the local jail, but managed to escape the same evening. Nelson made the mistake of trying to catch the same train that was transporting members of the Winnipeg police, and was recaptured twelve hours after his initial escape. He was officially arrested again the next morning by an officer from the Crystal City police department, on the rail line east of Wakopa.

Nelson was taken to the Rupert Street Police Station in Winnipeg where he was photographed, fingerprinted, measured, and prepared for identification lineups. Nearly 4,000 spectators awaited his arrival outside the station, hoping to glimpse the accused man. Photographs of Nelson taken by Winnipeg police were shortly sent out to police departments throughout the U.S.; this resulted in positive identifications from witnesses in Illinois and California who claimed the man was the same unknown renter they had had encounters with. Though he maintained that his identity was that of &quot;Virgil Wilson,&quot; fingerprints forwarded to Winnipeg from the San Francisco Police Department from his earlier arrests confirmed his identity as Earle Nelson. Nelson&#x27;s fingerprints matched those left behind at several of the crime scenes, and his teeth matched marks found on victims.

Initially, Nelson admitted to his crimes, bluntly telling reporters: &quot;I only do my lady killings on Saturday nights.&quot; However, he would subsequently retract his admission and claim he was innocent. Upon an interview with the &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot; shortly after his arrest, he said: &quot;I&#x27;m charged with two murders. But I&#x27;m not the one who done it.&quot; When asked about the various persons in the U.S. and Canada who had positively identified him as the &quot;Strangler,&quot; he simply responded: &quot;All of &#x27;em are wrong.&quot; Despite attempts on part of both U.S. and Canadian law enforcement agencies to elicit confessions, Nelson refused to admit to any of the murders of which he was suspected or accused.

==Trial and execution==

At the time of his arrest, Nelson was wanted in six U.S. cities, and was held to be tried in a Manitoba court for the murders of both Cowan and Patterson. He was also charged with two counts of attempted molestation and one count of burglary. Nelson&#x27;s trial was scheduled to begin June 27, 1927, but postponed at the request of his attorney, and instead began on November 1 at the Winnipeg Law Courts Building. The case was prosecuted by R. B. Graham, and overseen by Justice Andrew Dysart. 

Nelson was defended by court-appointed attorney James H. Stitt. Nelson&#x27;s ex-wife Mary Martin testified against him, claiming that he was &quot;absolutely insane.&quot; Additionally, over sixty individuals from both Canada and the U.S. testified, many placing Nelson at the scenes of the various crimes or linking him to property stolen from victims&#x27; homes. A jail guard who oversaw Nelson throughout his trial noted that he had become particularly obsessed with a certain Biblical passage from the Book of Proverbs, which read:
Closing statements in Nelson&#x27;s trial were completed on November 5, 1927. After forty minutes of deliberation, the jury found him guilty of murder and he received a mandatory death sentence. Relatives of victims McConnell and Cowan visited Nelson in prison after his conviction, and he continued to proclaim his innocence. In late December 1927, Stitt submitted a thirty-page document to Minister of Justice Ernest Lapointe, petitioning for clemency on the grounds that Nelson was insane and that his personal history had been unfairly presented to the jury via the press. 

The &quot;eloquent, even moving&quot; document consisted of twenty affidavits from persons who had known Nelson throughout his life who swore they were &quot;in a position to know full well the character and mentality of the said Earle Nelson that [they] verily believed without exaggeration or mental reservation [that he had] been for a long period of time a person of unsound mind.&quot; In one of the affidavits, Mrs. L. J. Casey, who had employed Nelson as a groundskeeper in 1926, attested to this, noting that she &quot;hear[d] him laughing and talking to himself all the time. One day while I happened to be there, he sat right outside in the drenching rain, looking at the sky, without a coat, until he was soaked through.&quot; Despite the abundance of affidavits, the appeal was denied, and Nelson&#x27;s execution was scheduled for the second Friday of January.

Nelson was executed by hanging at 7:30 a.m. on January 13, 1928 at the Vaughan Street Jail in Winnipeg. His final words were: &quot;I forgive those who have wronged me.&quot;

==&quot;Modus operandi&quot;==
When his identity was still unknown, law enforcement surmised that Nelson was a predator who &quot;possessed a dual personality,&quot; likening him to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. However, his &quot;modus operandi&quot; was clear even to investigators at the time of the crimes&#x27; occurrences.

Nelson&#x27;s victims were mostly landladies, whom he would approach on the pretext of renting a room. Many of these victims were targeted after having placed &quot;room for rent&quot; advertisements in local newspapers. Nelson, well-versed in Christian theology, often studied his worn Bible, using it to keep his victim at ease and off-guard. Once he had gained their trust and was able to access their homes, he would kill them (almost always by strangling) and sometimes engage in necrophilia with the corpse. Nelson would often hide the body, leaving it under the nearest bed. In several of his murders committed in Portland, he went to additional lengths to conceal the body, hiding it in the attic or in a steamer trunk within the house. Other victims were concealed in closets or behind furnaces in the house.

At the peak of his killing spree, Nelson was killing once every three weeks on average. His killings sometimes occurred in spurts. His last victim, Emily Patterson, had been his fifth victim in only ten days.

==Pathology==
Though there are many extant documents regarding Nelson and his trial, few of them contain psychiatric information regarding his pathology. During Nelson&#x27;s incarceration leading up to his trial, he was examined by Dr. Alvin T. Mathers, chief of the psychiatric ward and Winnipeg General Hospital, on five separate occasions between July 27 and October 24, 1927. Based on these sessions, Mathers testified in court: &quot;I did not find any evidence that to me would constitute insanity.&quot;

==Historical significance==
Nelson was the first serial murderer in American history whose crimes were subject to widespread media attention in newspapers, national magazines, and the then-new medium of the radio. His crimes and trial received international media attention, appearing in newspapers across the United States, Canada, and Australia. Nelson&#x27;s confirmed murder count, which exceeded twenty, remained a record high for nearly fifty years until the discovery of Juan Corona&#x27;s crimes in 1971. According to crime historians Harold Schechter and David Everitt, Nelson was the first serial sex murderer in twentieth-century America.

==Victims==
Though Nelson refused to admit to any of the crimes of which he was accused, he has been linked to a total of 22 murders that occurred between 1926 and 1927; his victims consisted nearly exclusively of women, along with one male infant child.

==In popular culture==
Nelson&#x27;s murder spree served as a source of inspiration for the 1943 Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, which focuses on a serial killer, the &quot;Merry Widow Murderer&quot; (portrayed by Joseph Cotten), who targets elderly widows.

<text>Frederick Anthony Picariello, Jr. (born December 4, 1936), better known by his stage name Freddy Cannon, is an American rock and roll singer. His biggest international hits included &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot;, &quot;Way Down Yonder in New Orleans&quot;, and &quot;Palisades Park&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Picariello was born in Revere, Massachusetts on December 4, 1936, and moved to neighboring Lynn, Massachusetts as a child. His father worked as a truck driver and also played trumpet and sang in local bands. Freddy grew up listening to the rhythm and blues music of Big Joe Turner, Buddy Johnson and others on the radio, and he learned to play guitar. He attended Lynn Vocation High School.

==Career==
Cannon made his recording debut as a singer in 1958, singing and playing rhythm guitar on a single, &quot;Cha-Cha-Do&quot; by the Spindrifts, which became a local hit. He had also played lead guitar on a session for an R&amp;B vocal group, the G-Clefs, whose record &quot;Ka-Ding Dong&quot; made No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1956. At a young age he joined the National Guard, took a job driving a truck, married, and became a father.

Inspired musically by Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Little Richard, he formed his own group, Freddy Karmon &amp; the Hurricanes, which became increasingly popular in the Greater Boston area, and began to develop a trademark strained singing style. He also became a regular on a local TV dance show, &quot;Boston Ballroom&quot;, and, in 1958, signed up to a management contract with Boston disc jockey Jack McDermott. With lyrics written by his mother, he prepared a new song which he called &quot;Rock and Roll Baby&quot;, and he produced a demo which McDermott took to the writing and production team of Bob Crewe and Frank Slay. They rearranged the song, rewrote the lyrics, and offered to produce a recording in return for two-thirds of the composing credits. The first recording of the song, now titled &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot;, with a guitar solo by session musician Kenny Paulson, was rejected by several record companies, but was then heard by TV presenter Dick Clark who part-owned Swan Records in Philadelphia. 

Clark suggested that the song be re-edited and overdubbed to add excitement, by highlighting the pounding bass drum sound and adding hand claps and Freddy&#x27;s cries of &quot;whoo!&quot;, which later became one of his trademarks. The single was finally released by Swan Records, with the company president, Bernie Binnick, suggesting Freddy&#x27;s new stage name of &quot;Freddy Cannon&quot;. After being promoted and becoming successful in Boston and Philadelphia, the single gradually received national airplay. In 1959, it peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the first of his 22 songs to appear on the Billboard chart, and also reached No. 13 on the R&amp;B singles chart. In the UK, where his early records were issued on the Top Rank label, it reached No. 17. &quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

He stayed on the Swan label with producer Frank Slay for the next five years and became known as Freddy &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Cannon for the thumping power of his recordings. Dick Clark brought him national exposure through his numerous appearances on his television program, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, a record of 110 appearances in total. In the words of writer Cub Koda:&quot;Freddy Cannon was a true believer, a rocker to the bone. Freddy Cannon made rock &amp; roll records; great noisy rock &amp; roll records, and all of them were infused with a gigantic drum beat that was an automatic invitation to shake it on down anyplace there was a spot to dance.&quot;

His second single &quot;Okefenokee&quot; (credited to Freddie Cannon, as were several of his other records) only made No. 43 on the charts, but the next record, &quot;Way Down Yonder In New Orleans&quot;, a rocked-up version of a 1922 song, became a gold record and reached No. 3 in the pop charts in both the US and the UK, where it was the biggest of his hits. It also sold over one million copies. Cannon toured in Britain and, in March 1960, his album &quot;The Explosive Freddy Cannon&quot; became the first album by a rock and roll singer to top the UK Albums Chart. 

For the next two years, until early 1962, he continued to have lesser chart hits in the U.S., in some cases with versions of old standards including &quot;Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy&quot; and Edward &quot;Kid&quot; Ory&#x27;s &quot;Muskrat Ramble&quot;. His hits also included &quot;Twistin&#x27; All Night Long&quot;, recorded with Danny &amp; the Juniors and also featuring Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons on backing vocals. However, one of his biggest hits came in May 1962 with &quot;Palisades Park&quot;, written by future TV &quot;Gong Show&quot; host Chuck Barris. Produced by Slay with overdubbed rollercoaster sound effects, it reached No. 3 on the Hot 100, No. 15 on the R&amp;B chart, and No. 20 in the UK. This release also sold over one million copies, gaining gold disc status.

Cannon also appeared with Bobby Vee, Johnny Tillotson and others, in the movie &quot;Just for Fun&quot;, made in the UK in 1962. Although his popularity in the US faded, he remained a popular touring act in Britain and elsewhere in the world for some years. In 1963, he signed for Warner Bros. Records where he recorded his last two US top twenty hits, &quot;Abigail Beecher&quot; (No. 16) in 1964 and the following year &quot;Action&quot; (No. 13), from Dick Clark&#x27;s TV show &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;, which he recorded with top Los Angeles session musicians including Leon Russell, James Burton, Glen Campbell, and David Gates. &quot;Action&quot; got a fourth gold disc for Cannon. Also in 1965, Slay acquired Cannon&#x27;s Swan recordings and sold them to Warner Bros.
He appeared, along with the Beau Brummels, in &quot;Village of the Giants&quot;, a teen movie with early film appearances by Beau Bridges and Ron Howard, and played himself, performing one of his songs, in the final episode of the teen soap opera, &quot;Never Too Young&quot;, on June 24, 1966. 

After leaving Warner Bros. Records in 1967, Cannon released singles on several labels, including Sire, Royal American, Metromedia, MCA, Andee, Claridge, Horn, and Amherst. In the 1970s he recorded and became a promotional man for Buddah Records, but returned to the lower reaches of the charts in 1981 with &quot;Let&#x27;s Put the Fun Back in Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll,&quot; recorded with the Belmonts for MiaSound Records and in 1982 appeared in the independent movie, &quot;The Junkman&quot;. After that, he continued to work with Dick Clark at his &quot;American Bandstand&quot; reunion concerts and toured all over the world. In 2002, he released an album of seasonal songs, &quot;Have A Boom Boom Christmas!!&quot;

One notable fan of Cannon&#x27;s was the late Box Tops and Big Star singer Alex Chilton; Chilton reportedly had a portrait of Cannon hanging on the wall of his home in New Orleans and had once offered the following comment about Cannon to a friend: &quot;Freddy Cannon’s shows always worked, because he moved through life with ease.&quot;

<doc id="1135527" wikidata="Q7409165" url="?curid=1135527" title="Same-sex marriage in Prince Edward Island">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Prince Edward Island since July 20, 2005. The Canadian province began the process of updating its laws to recognize same-sex marriage after the passage of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; in the House of Commons of Canada. Prince Edward Island had been one of only four provinces and territories, with Alberta, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, where same-sex marriage had not already been legalized by court challenges prior to the passage of the law.

==Background==
On December 10, 2004, Premier Pat Binns said that his government would wait for federal legislation to resolve the issue. It is unclear how Binns would have reacted if a provincial court had found the heterosexual definition of marriage in violation of the &quot;Charter&quot; rights of gays and lesbians. A spokeswoman for a local LGBT group said in June 2005 that the province should legalize same-sex marriage &quot;right away&quot;, noting that the island often lagged behind the rest of Canada on the issue of LGBT rights, &quot;It&#x27;s also sad to think in a province that could actually lead, on this particular issue, that they choose to stand by and wait for the federal government to make the decision. Thereby not having anyone in government make the commitment to these human rights issues.&quot;

==Civil Marriage Act==
After the House of Commons of Canada passed the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; in June 2005, provincial Attorney General Mildred Dover announced that the province would bring provincial legislation in line with the law, &quot;We have said all along that we would comply if the federal government passed same-sex legislation. They have the power to define marriage. We&#x27;re looking at the possibility of bringing in an omnibus bill that would say something to the effect of wherever the word spouse appears in our legislation, it includes same-sex and heterosexual marriages.&quot; The Act passed through the Canadian Senate on July 19 and received royal assent the next day on July 20, 2005, extending same-sex marriage rights across all of Canada.

However, Ms. Dover announced that marriage licences would not be issued to same-sex couples until the province&#x27;s laws were updated. This was different from how the process had worked in other provinces; in those where courts called for same-sex marriage, and in Alberta after the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; was passed. On July 22, Prince Edward Island was the only remaining province in the country where same-sex couples could not marry in practice. Dover said, &quot;We&#x27;ll do it as quickly as we can. We didn&#x27;t prepare beforehand because, if we had prepared and changed all the wording, then people would say &#x27;Why did you do that when it hadn&#x27;t passed?&#x27;&quot; Complaints immediately arose charging that the delay imposed by the province was illegal and violated the legal rights of same-sex couples. In response to these complaints, the province reversed its position. The first same-sex couple to wed on Prince Edward Island were Dr. Chris Zarow and Constance Majeau on August 20, 2005 in Vernon Bridge, as reported by the &quot;Charlottetown Guardian&quot;. Reverend Barry King officiated at the ceremony. He said: &quot;Today we celebrate the beginning of a journey for Connie and Chris. This journey is filled with joy because it&#x27;s filled with love. Connie and Chris chose this path because they love each other.&quot;

==Provincial legislation==
In May 2008, provincial law was finally brought in line with the federal legislation. A bill amending the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;, the &quot;Adoption Act&quot; and several other acts regarding family law was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island and given royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Barbara Oliver Hagerman. The law replaced references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; with the gender-neutral term &quot;spouses&quot;, and the &quot;Adoption Act&quot; was amended to allow married same-sex couples to adopt children jointly. The law took effect on 19 December 2009.

Prince Edward Island legislation also recognises cohabitation agreements which can be entered into by unmarried couples living together. These written agreements, recognized by the provincial &quot;Family Law Act&quot;, outline the rights and responsibilities of common-law partners. The agreement provides partners with some, but not all, of the rights and benefits of marriage. Common-law partners have the same rights to spousal support, child support and child custody as married couples. However, common-law couples are treated differently to married spouses with regard to inheritance and property rights. They have no right to inheritance if the partner were to die, and do not have the right to division of property or to stay in the common home upon separation or the death of the partner.

==Marriage statistics==
The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 230 same-sex couples living in Prince Edward Island.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. In September of the same year, Bishop Ron Cutler of the Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island issued a pastoral letter allowing local parishes to perform same-sex marriages.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council.

==Public opinion==
A 2017 CROP poll showed that 78% of respondents in Atlantic Canada supported same-sex marriage, but did not give a figure for each Atlantic province individually. Nationwide, 74% of Canadians found it &quot;great that in Canada, two people of the same sex can get married&quot;, while 26% disagreed.

<doc id="1135529" wikidata="Q1852702" url="?curid=1135529" title="Hardiness (plants)">
<text>Hardiness of plants describes their ability to survive adverse growing conditions. It is usually limited to discussions of climatic adversity. Thus a plant&#x27;s ability to tolerate cold, heat, drought, flooding, or wind are typically considered measurements of hardiness. Hardiness of plants is defined by their native extent&#x27;s geographic location: longitude, latitude and elevation. These attributes are often simplified to a hardiness zone. In temperate latitudes, the term most often describes resistance to cold, or &quot;cold-hardiness&quot;, and is generally measured by the lowest temperature a plant can withstand.

Hardiness of a plant may be divided into two categories: tender, and hardy. Tender plants are those killed by freezing temperatures, while hardy plants survive freezing—at least down to certain temperatures, depending on the plant. &quot;Half-hardy&quot; is a term used sometimes in horticulture to describe bedding plants which are sown in heat in winter or early spring, and planted outside after all danger of frost has passed. &quot;Fully hardy&quot; usually refers to plants being classified under the Royal Horticultural Society classifications, and can often cause confusion to those not using this method. When this distinction is made a fully tropical plant that requires hot temperatures to grow and display is termed a &quot;tender&quot; plant.

Plants vary greatly in their tolerance of growing conditions, and are capable of adaptation to changes in climate on their own to some extent. The selective breeding of varieties capable of withstanding particular climates forms an important part of agriculture and horticulture. Part of the work of nursery growers of plants consists of cold hardening, or hardening off their plants, to prepare them for likely conditions in later life.

==Winter hardiness==
Winter-hardy plants grow during the winter, or at least remain healthy and dormant. Apart from hardy evergreens, these include many cultivated plants, including varieties of cabbage and broccoli, and all kinds of carrot. Some bulbs – such as tulips – need cold winters to bloom, while others – such as freesia – can survive a freezing winter. Many domestic plants are assigned a hardiness zone that specifies the climates in which they can survive. Winter gardens are dependent upon the cultivation of winter-hardy plants.

===Mechanisms===
Woody plants survive freezing temperatures by suppressing the formation of ice in living cells or by allowing water to freeze in plant parts that are not affected by ice formation. The common mechanism for woody plants to survive down to –40 °C (–40 °F) is supercooling. Woody plants that survive lower temperatures are dehydrating their cells, allowing water to freeze between cell walls and the cells to survive. Plants normally considered hardy may not survive freezing if they are not readily acclimated, which renders them unable to use these mechanisms. Some plants are able to withstand freezing temperatures year-round, like those living in Antarctica such as Colobanthus quitensis. 

==Hardiness ratings==

Various hardiness ratings are published. In the United States (US), the most widely used is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) system of hardiness zones based on average minimum yearly temperatures. This system was developed specifically for the extremely diverse range of conditions in the US, from baking desert to frozen tundra. Another commonly used system is the Sunset Climate Zone system. This system is much more specific to climates (i.e. precipitation, temperature, and humidity based) and less dependent on the yearly minimum.

In contrast the United Kingdom (UK) and Western Europe have an oceanic climate, and experience a narrower range of temperatures that is tempered by the presence of the Gulf Stream. This results in areas like western Scotland experiencing relatively mild winter conditions and cool summers that enable the growing of some subtropical plants, despite being well to the north of subtropical climate areas. The Royal Horticultural Society has published a set of hardiness ratings applicable to the UK. The ratings range from H1a to H7. H1a, higher than , applies to tropical plants permanently under glass in heat; while H7, below , applies to very cold-tolerant plants such as heathers. Most outdoor plants in the UK fall within the range H4, (hardy in the average winter) to H5, (hardy in a cold winter). Also, the average minimum temperature in the UK is much warmer than the average minimums in much of the northern US, while the average maximums in the northern US are often much warmer in summer than the UK.

In addition to cold tolerance, plant hardiness has been observed to be linked to how much stress specific plants are undergoing into the winter, or even how fast the onset of cold weather is in a specific year. This means that often stressed plants will exhibit less cold tolerance than plants that have been well maintained. Plants may also die if the winter changes from balmy to exceptionally cold in a short period of time.

==Hardy plants==
Hardy plants are generally known as plants that can tolerate a variety of extreme (both cold and hot) temperatures , harsh environments, and poor or eroded soils, such as Milkweed and Cranesbill; and economically advantageous because of their little or negligible maintenance .

== Other hardiness ==
Tolerance to other climatic factors are often omitted from the &quot;hardiness&quot; discussion. This section provides a very brief overview of the topics.
* Heat tolerance may be displayed alongside cold-hardiness, such as in the American Horticultural Society&#x27;s &quot;Heat Zones&quot;. See and Breeding for heat stress tolerance.
* For drought tolerance, see and Breeding for drought stress tolerance.
* For flood tolerance, see cited review.
* The mechanisms of wind tolerance are still poorly understood. Wind not only causes mechanical stress, but also makes the plant colder and dryer. Plants may evolutionally adapt to wind by becoming smaller (to avoid wind) or bigger (to resist the wind). Physiologically, the mechanical force also causes a cascade of signals in the living plant.

<doc id="1135531" wikidata="Q7409172" url="?curid=1135531" title="Same-sex marriage in the Northwest Territories">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in the Northwest Territories since July 20, 2005. The Canadian territory began granting marriage licences to same-sex couples upon the granting of royal assent to the federal &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;. The Northwest Territories had been one of only four provinces and territories, with Alberta, Nunavut and Prince Edward Island, where same-sex marriage had not already been legalised by court challenges prior to the passage of the federal law.

==Court proceedings==
In December 2004, Justice Minister Charles Dent said that the Northwest Territories Government would not issue marriage licences to same-sex couples until a court ruling or federal legislation legalised same-sex marriage. However, he indicated that the territory would not contest any lawsuit on the subject, and would comply with such a ruling or law.

On May 20, 2005, a Yellowknife couple, Jason Perrino and Colin Snow, sued the territorial government over the right to get married, arguing that refusing them a licence was a violation of their &quot;Charter&quot; rights. The Northwest Territories Supreme Court was supposed to hear the case on May 27, 2005; however, it was adjourned for three weeks at the request of a couple who wanted intervenor status in the case to oppose same-sex marriage. Ruby and Laurin Trudel of Yellowknife applied to intervene in the lawsuit. They had been members of Yellowknife&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church until it started to share communion and the pulpit with the United Church, a denomination which had begun blessing same-sex unions. The couple was granted intervenor status, and on June 17, 2005, &quot;CBC North&quot; reported that the intervenors had requested party status in the case. If it had been granted by the Supreme Court, it would have given them more direct involvement in the case, and the right to appeal in the event the judge sided with the plaintiffs&#x27; request to allow same-sex marriage in the territory. The case was put off again for another three weeks, and was set to resume on July 6. On June 30, financial support for the Trudels evaporated. Their lawyer withdrew his services, and the Trudels decided to proceed alone, without legal representation.

On July 6, Ruby Trudel, alone, testified before the Supreme Court. She apologised to the court for her lack of knowledge of court procedures, and said that she was not homophobic, &quot;While we do not support, encourage or endorse their lifestyle, we hold nothing against them personally.&quot; She said that those who promote the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage had been &quot;rendered voiceless at the federal level.&quot; Actually, the debates in the Canadian Senate were in full swing at that time. She expressed concern over the possibility of persecution of Christian clergy if same-sex marriage were to become legalised, &quot;If the application before this court were to succeed, there is every reason to believe that repercussions against people of conscience and religion...will soon begin to occur here also.&quot; She asked that the court not impose costs on them, &quot;Costs incurred to this point already exceed our ability to pay.&quot;

A ruling never came from the Supreme Court, and royal assent was granted to the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; on July 20, 2005, legalising same-sex marriage nationwide in Canada. Perrino and Snow were awarded $5,000 in legal fees to cover court costs. On October 17, 2005, Supreme Court Justice Virginia Schuler ordered the federal government, and therefore Canadian taxpayers, to reimburse the plaintiffs for costs they incurred during their legal challenge. Perrino and Snow married following the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the territory.

==Territorial legislation==
In June 2002, the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories approved amendments to the &quot;Adoption Act&quot; allowing same-sex couples to adopt children jointly, and the &quot;Family Law Act&quot; changing the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; to grant same-sex couples limited legal rights. Further legislation was passed in March 2005.

On March 7, 2017, the Legislative Assembly approved the &quot;Marriage Act&quot;. The Act defines marriage as &quot;a voluntary union of two persons to the exclusion of all others&quot;, and uses gender-neutral language when referring to spouses. It received royal assent by acting Commissioner Gerald Kisoun on March 10, and went into effect on June 1, 2017.

==Marriage statistics==
The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 75 same-sex couples living in the Northwest Territories.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada narrowly rejected a motion to authorise same-sex marriage and allow clergy in the church to officiate at such marriages. Instead, the church synod passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. Clergy of the Diocese of The Arctic, including Bishop David Parsons, have been vocally opposed to the solemnisation of same-sex marriages within the church. Following the passage of the resolution, several dioceses, including those of Ottawa and Rupert&#x27;s Land, announced they would permit their clergy to solemnise same-sex marriages in accordance with the new resolution passed by the church synod. The Diocese of The Arctic chose to distance itself from these dioceses, but, responding to concerns that it might be leaving the Anglican Church of Canada, it released a statement, &quot;The Diocese of the Arctic remains a diocese within the Anglican Church of Canada, but must distance itself from those who violate the marriage canon. The implication of this is a state of &#x27;impaired communion&#x27;.&quot;

Some other religious organisations perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council.

<text>Memory scrubbing consists of reading from each computer memory location, correcting bit errors (if any) with an error-correcting code (ECC), and writing the corrected data back to the same location.

Due to the high integration density of modern computer memory chips, the individual memory cell structures became small enough to be vulnerable to cosmic rays and/or alpha particle emission. The errors caused by these phenomena are called soft errors. Over 8% of DIMM modules experience at least one correctable error per year. This can be a problem for DRAM and SRAM based memories. The probability of a soft error at any individual memory bit is very small. However, together with the large amount of memory modern computersespecially serversare equipped with, and together with extended periods of uptime, the probability of soft errors in the total memory installed is significant.

The information in an ECC memory is stored redundantly enough to correct single bit error per memory word. Hence, an ECC memory can support the scrubbing of the memory content. Namely, if the memory controller scans systematically through the memory, the single bit errors can be detected, the erroneous bit can be determined using the ECC checksum, and the corrected data can be written back to the memory.

== Overview ==
It is important to check each memory location periodically, frequently enough, before &quot;multiple&quot; bit errors within the same word are too likely to occur, because the &quot;one&quot; bit errors can be corrected, but the &quot;multiple&quot; bit errors are not correctable, in the case of usual (as of 2008) ECC memory modules.

In order to not disturb regular memory requests from the CPU and thus prevent decreasing performance, scrubbing is usually only done during idle periods. As the scrubbing consists of normal read and write operations, it may increase power consumption for the memory compared to non-scrubbing operation. Therefore, scrubbing is not performed continuously but periodically. For many servers, the scrub period can be configured in the BIOS setup program.

The normal memory reads issued by the CPU or DMA devices are checked for ECC errors, but due to data locality reasons they can be confined to a small range of addresses and keeping other memory locations untouched for a very long time. These locations can become vulnerable to more than one soft error, while scrubbing ensures the checking of the whole memory within a guaranteed time.

On some systems, not only the main memory (DRAM-based) is capable of scrubbing but also the CPU caches (SRAM-based). On most systems the scrubbing rates for both can be set independently. Because cache is much smaller than the main memory, the scrubbing for caches does not need to happen as frequently.

Memory scrubbing increases reliability, therefore it can be classified as a RAS feature.

=== Variants ===
There are usually two variants, known as &quot;patrol scrubbing&quot; and &quot;demand scrubbing&quot;. While they both essentially perform memory scrubbing and associated error correction (if it is doable), the main difference is how these two variants are initiated and executed. Patrol scrubbing runs in an automated manner when the system is idle, while demand scrubbing performs the error correction when the data is actually requested from main memory.

<text>&quot;Night Surf&quot; is a post-apocalyptic short story by Stephen King, first published in the spring 1969 issue of &quot;Ubris&quot;. In 1978 it was collected in King&#x27;s book &quot;Night Shift&quot;.

==Plot summary==
On an August night on Anson Beach, New Hampshire, a group of former college students have survived a plague caused by a virus called A6, or &quot;Captain Trips&quot;. They believe the virus spread out of Southeast Asia and wiped out most of humanity. 

The characters&#x27; outlook is grim. They encounter a delirious man dying of the plague and burn him alive on a pyre as a half-serious black magic human sacrifice. The protagonist, Bernie, reflects upon this new world and reminisces about &quot;the time before&quot; when he went to Anson Beach in his youth, years before the plague. All the members of Bernie&#x27;s group had survived a virus called A2, which supposedly made them immune to A6. But Needles reveals to Bernie that he has contracted A6. Bernie admits to himself that deep down they know that A2 is not a guarantee against A6 and that they will probably all be dead by Christmas. Bernie&#x27;s girlfriend keeps up the pretense, accepting Bernie&#x27;s explanation that Needles must have lied about having A2 so the others would not leave him behind.

== Publication ==
&quot;Night Surf&quot; was first published in the spring 1969 issue of &quot;Ubris&quot; magazine. A heavily revised version was published in the August 1974 issue of &quot;Cavalier&quot; magazine. In 1978, the story was collected in King&#x27;s first book of short stories, &quot;Night Shift&quot;. At eight pages long, it is one of King&#x27;s shortest short stories.

== Adaptations ==
Writer-director Peter Sullivan adapted &quot;Night Surf&quot; as a short film, produced in 2002. Optioned from King for a dollar, the film is part of the Dollar Baby collection of similar short films.

<text>Hans Berger (21 May 1873 – 1 June 1941) was a German psychiatrist. He is best known as the inventor of electroencephalography (EEG) in 1924, which is a method used for recording the electrical activity of the brain, commonly described in terms of brainwaves, and as the discoverer of the alpha wave rhythm which is a type of brainwave. Alpha waves have been eponymously referred to as the &quot;Berger wave.&quot;

== Biography ==
Berger was born in Neuses (now part of Coburg), Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Germany.

After attending Casimirianum, where he gained his abitur in 1892, Berger enrolled as a mathematics student at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena with the intention of becoming an astronomer. After one semester, he abandoned his studies and enlisted for a year of service in the cavalry. During a training exercise, his horse suddenly reared, and he landed in the path of a horse-drawn cannon. The driver of the artillery battery halted the horses in time, leaving the young Berger shaken but with no serious injuries. His sister, at home many kilometres away, had a feeling he was in danger and insisted their father telegram him. The incident made such an impression on Berger that, years later in 1940, he wrote: &quot;It was a case of spontaneous telepathy in which at a time of mortal danger, and as I contemplated certain death, I transmitted my thoughts, while my sister, who was particularly close to me, acted as the receiver.&quot;

On completion of his military service, and obsessed by the idea of how his mind could have carried a signal to his sister, Berger returned to Jena to study medicine with the goal of discovering the physiological basis of &quot;psychic energy.&quot; His central theme became &quot;the search for the correlation between objective activity in the brain and subjective psychic phenomena.&quot;

After obtaining his medical degree from Jena in 1897, Berger joined the staff of Otto Ludwig Binswanger (1852–1929), who held the chair in psychiatry and neurology at the Jena clinic. Habilitated in 1901, he qualified as a senior university lecturer in 1906 and physician-in-chief in 1912, eventually succeeding Binswanger in 1919. He also collaborated with two famous scientists and physicians, Oskar Vogt (1870–1959) and Korbinian Brodmann (1868–1918), in their research on lateralization of brain function. Berger married his technical assistant, Baroness Ursula von Bülow, in 1911 and later served as an army psychiatrist on the Western front during World War I. He was elected Rector of Jena University in 1927.

In 1924, Berger succeeded in recording the first human electroencephalogram (EEG), a term he coined. Filled with doubt, he took five years to publish his first paper in 1929, which demonstrated the technique for &quot;recording the electrical activity of the human brain from the surface of the head.&quot; His findings were met with incredulity and derision by the German medical and scientific establishments. Having visited the EEG laboratory at Jena in 1935, American roboticist William Grey Walter noted that Berger:... was not regarded by his associates as in the front rank of German psychiatrists, having rather the reputation of being a crank. He seemed to me to be a modest and dignified person, full of good humour, and as unperturbed by lack of recognition as he was later by the fame it eventually brought upon him. But he had one fatal weakness: he was completely ignorant of the technical and physical basis of his method. He knew nothing about mechanics or electricity. After British electrophysiologists Edgar Douglas Adrian and B. H. C. Matthews confirmed Berger&#x27;s basic observations in 1934, the importance of his discoveries in electroencephalography (EEG) was finally recognized at an international forum in 1937. By 1938, electroencephalography had gained widespread recognition by eminent researchers in the field, leading to its practical use in diagnosis in the United States, England, and France.
In 1938, at the retirement age of 65, Berger was made Professor Emeritus in Psychology. According to biographers Niedermeyer and Lopes da Silva, the appointment occurred in an unceremonious manner as his relationship with the Nazi regime was particularly strained. Numerous sources report that, given their hostile relationship, the Nazis forced Berger into retirement that same year with a complete ban of any further work on EEG. These biographical accounts were contradicted in 2005 by Ernst Klee, a German journalist specializing in the exposure and documentation of Nazi medical crimes. In 2005, Dr. Susanne Zimmermann, medical historian at the University of Jena, found evidence that Berger had not been forced into retirement but had &quot;served on the selection committee for his successor&quot; Berthold Kihn, who was sacked as a Nazi after the war. Moreover, official records at the University of Jena dating from the 1930s proved that Berger had served on the &quot;Erbgesundheitsgericht&quot; (Court for Genetic Health) that imposed sterilizations, while his diaries contained anti-Semitic comments. Dr Zimmermann&#x27;s findings corroborated research published in Germany in 2003, documenting Berger&#x27;s invitation by the SS racial hygienist Karl Astel to work for the EGOG (&quot;Erbgesundheitsobergericht&quot;, Higher Genetic Health Court) in 1941. Berger replied: &quot;I am gladly willing to work again as an assessor at the Court for Genetic Health in Jena, for which I thank you.&quot; Berger did not join the SS, SA, or Nazi Party &quot;despite the significant Nazification of the University of Jena, but was a supporting SS member, possibly for self-protection.&quot;

After a long period of clinical depression, and suffering from a severe skin infection, Berger died from suicide by hanging on June 1, 1941, in the southern wing of the clinic.

== Research ==
Among his many research interests in neurology, Berger studied brain circulation, psychophysiology, and brain temperature. One of his early experiments on the brain involved a gentleman with a cranial defect that left part of the brain exposed. The gentleman allowed Berger to insert a liquid-filled rubber tube through the hole in his skull. A latex cap sealed the opening, creating a pressure gauge. At the other end of the rubber tube was a pen that recorded the pressure fluctuations on paper wrapped around a rotating drum. Berger noticed that the pen recorded waves that would change when he asked his conscious participant to perform different cognitive tasks. He also observed changes when the participant experienced changes in emotions or sensory stimulation. Berger followed this work with his most significant contribution to modern science. British physician, Richard Caton (1842-1926), had previously described electrical potentials recorded from the exposed cortices of dogs and nonhuman apes. Berger&#x27;s patient gave him the opportunity to apply Caton&#x27;s technique to a human. The result was the first demonstration of human electroencephalography (EEG). In 1924, Berger made the first EEG recording of human brain activity and called it &quot;Elektrenkephalogramm&quot;.

Using the EEG, he was also the first to describe the different waves or rhythms that were present in the normal and abnormal brain, such as the alpha wave rhythm (7.812 to 13.28 Hz), also known as &quot;Berger&#x27;s wave&quot;; and its suppression (substitution by the faster beta waves) when the subject opens the eyes (the so-called &quot;alpha blockade&quot;). He also studied and described for the first time the nature of EEG alterations in brain diseases such as epilepsy.

His method involved inserting silver wires under the patients scalp, one at the front of the head and one at the back. Later, he used silver foil electrodes attached to the head by a rubber bandage. As a recording device, he first used the Lippmann capillary electrometer, but results were disappointing. He then switched to the string galvanometer and later to a double-coil Siemens recording galvanometer, which allowed him to record electrical voltages as small as one ten-thousandth of a volt. The resulting output, up to three seconds in duration, was then photographed by an assistant.

The EEG has been a useful tool in modern medical and psychological practices by allowing clinicians to describe and diagnose various conditions and diseases. If an individual goes to get an EEG, the doctor will look at the waveform patterns to determine how different stimuli affect the brain. These waveform patterns are called evoked potentials or EPs. If a patient&#x27;s brain waves do not follow the normal EP pattern, that is an indication of a deficit in the processing of the stimuli. There are also event-related potentials, or ERPs, which provide information about mental processing of patients. Both EPs and ERPs are tools that can help doctors determine any abnormalities. The studies researching ERPs have also been helpful in the development of the brain mapping technique.

== Hans-Berger-Preis ==
A prize awarded triennially by the &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Klinische Neurophysiologie&quot; (German Society of Clinical Neurophysiology) for long-standing, extensive academic work in theoretical or clinical neurophysiology was named after Berger: the &quot;Hans-Berger-Preis&quot;. In 2021, however, in part due to Berger&#x27;s and other namesakes&#x27; work&#x27;s associations with the Nazi regime (e.g., Gottlob Berger), the society decided to rename all its awards to a purely factual description: The Hans-Berger-Preis is now the &quot;Medal of Merit for Lifetime Achievement in Neurophysiology and Functional Imaging&quot;.

<doc id="1135556" wikidata="Q1251780" url="?curid=1135556" title="Doug Kershaw">
<text>Douglas James Kershaw (born January 24, 1936) is an American fiddle player, singer, and songwriter from Louisiana. Active since 1948, he began his career as part of the duo Rusty and Doug, along with his brother, Rusty Kershaw. He had an extensive solo career that included 15 albums and singles that charted on the Hot Country Songs charts. He is also a member of the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, being inducted in 2009.

== Early life ==
Born in an unincorporated community called Tiel Ridge in Cameron Parish, Kershaw spoke Louisiana French and did not learn English until the age of eight. By that time, he had mastered the fiddle, which he played from the age of five, and was on his way to teaching himself to play 28 instruments. His first gig was at a local bar, the Bucket of Blood, where he was accompanied by his mother on guitar.

Kershaw became interested in Cajun music during parties his parents would host on the family&#x27;s houseboat in Louisiana, where he first heard Cajun bands playing the music.

==&quot;Doug and Rusty&quot;==
Doug grew up surrounded by Cajun fiddle and accordion music. After teaching his brother, Rusty, to play guitar, he formed a band, the Continental Playboys, with Rusty and older brother Nelson &quot;Peewee&quot; Kershaw in 1948. With the departure of Peewee from the group, in the early 1950s, Rusty and Doug continued to perform as a duo. In 1955, when Kershaw was 19, Rusty and he performed on the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; KWKH radio broadcast in Shreveport. The two also performed at the WWVA Jamboree (later renamed Jamboree U.S.A.), in Wheeling, West Virginia.

Although the brothers initially sang in French, J. D. &quot;Jay&quot; Miller, owner of the Feature Records label, persuaded them to incorporate songs in English into their repertoire. In 1955, Doug and Rusty recorded their first single, &quot;So Lovely, Baby&quot;. Released on the Hickory label, the tune went to number 14 on the country music charts. Later that same year, Doug and Rusty were invited to become members of the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; cast. The Kershaws appeared at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and became regular members of the Opry cast the following year.
Despite the demands of his music career, Doug enrolled in McNeese State University, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where he earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics. At the peak of their early career, in 1958, Doug and Rusty both enlisted in the United States Army. They devoted their attention to the military until their discharge three years later.

== &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; and solo career ==
After fulfilling their military obligation, the two brothers recorded &quot;Louisiana Man&quot;, an autobiographical song that Doug had written while in the Army. The song not only sold millions of copies, but also over the years has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music. The song was eventually covered by more than 800 artists.

Thhree albums were released by the duo on Hickory Records, only one being released before they split up. The first was &quot;Rusty and Doug Sing Louisiana Man&quot; (LPM 103) in 1961. &quot;Kershaw (Genus Cambarus)&quot; (LPS 163) was released in 1972 and was a double LP. &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; (HR 4506) was the final Hickory album, released in 1974. By 1964, the brothers had elected to go their separate ways. Another three years passed before Kershaw signed a songwriter&#x27;s contract with BMI, in 1967.

In June 1969, Kershaw made his first network-television appearance on the debut of the &quot;Johnny Cash Show&quot;. After watching Kershaw&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Cash Show&quot; performance as an eight-year-old boy, Mark O&#x27;Connor became inspired to learn to play the fiddle. He capped the year with a week-long engagement at the New York City&#x27;s Fillmore East as opening act for Eric Clapton&#x27;s Derek and the Dominos. While it seemed to many rock and pop fans that Kershaw had appeared out of nowhere, he had already sold more than 18 million copies of the records he had made in the early &#x27;60s with his brother, Rusty. &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; had been a top-10 country hit in 1961 and its follow-up, &quot;Diggy Liggy Lo&quot;, had done almost as well. His performance in front of a national audience led to Warner Bros. Records signing him to a long-term contract. In July 1969, he performed at the Newport folk festival along with Joni Mitchell, Arlo Guthrie, Ramblin Jack Elliott, Big Mama Thornton, and Mimi Fariña, among others. Newcomers that year were Don McLean, James Taylor, and Jerry Jeff Walker. In November 1969, &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; was broadcast back to Earth by the crew of the Apollo 12 Moon mission. Beyond the southern venues, Kershaw became widely known in mainstream America as he played at major urban concert halls.

In 1970, Kershaw contributed a violin part to Arlo Guthrie&#x27;s record single &quot;Alice&#x27;s Rock and Roll Restaurant.&quot;

In 1971, Kershaw had an acting and musical cameo, appearring briefly as a sort of &quot;clairvoyant&quot; desert fiddler in the film dubbed the first &quot;electric&quot; Western film titled &quot;Zachariah&quot;, starring Don Johnson and John Rubinstein.

Kershaw&#x27;s playing was featured in the Richard Brooks 1971 film &quot;Dollars&quot;.

In 1972, Kershaw played electric fiddle in Grand Funk&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot; off their LP &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Capitol SMAS 11099

== Later life ==
Despite the success of his solo career, Kershaw was plagued by depression and sorrow. His father had committed suicide when he was only seven. Marrying his wife, Pam, at the Houston Astrodome on June 21, 1975, Kershaw began raising his own family that included five sons – Douglas Jr, Victor, Zachary, Tyler, and Elijah; two grandsons, Joshua and Levi; a granddaughter, Courtney; great-grandson, Ethan; and three great-granddaughters, Baya, Lillian, and Scarlet. His son Tyler played drums in his band, and managed his shows, as well.

In 1978, Kershaw appeared briefly as a fiddler in the film &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;.

Kershaw rebounded with his biggest-selling hit, &quot;Hello Woman&quot;, which reached the country music top 40. By 1984, Kershaw&#x27;s battle with drug and alcohol abuse came to a close and his previously erratic behavior changed for the better.

In 1988, he recorded a duet, &quot;Cajun Baby&quot;, with Hank Williams, Jr., that became a top-50 country hit. Kershaw released a French-language album, &quot;Two-Step Fever&quot;, in 1999, and Michael Doucet of BeauSoleil is featured on the duet &quot;Fievre de Deux Etapes&quot;. &quot;Hot Diggity Doug&quot; was released in mid-2000 and &quot;Still Cajun After All These Years&quot; followed in early 2001, in which Kershaw was joined on tour by his eldest grandson Josh Kershaw on guitar.
His brother Rusty died on October 23, 2001.

Kershaw formerly owned and operated the Bayou House, a restaurant in Lucerne, Colorado, but parted ways with his partners in 2007 due to his displeasure with management and ambiance.

In 2009, Doug was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

Doug&#x27;s third cousin is country music star Sammy Kershaw.

<doc id="1135560" wikidata="Q244739" url="?curid=1135560" title="Lloyd Shapley">
<text>Lloyd Stowell Shapley (; June 2, 1923 – March 12, 2016) was an American mathematician and Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist. He contributed to the fields of mathematical economics and especially game theory. Shapley is generally considered one of the most important contributors to the development of game theory since the work of von Neumann and Morgenstern. With Alvin E. Roth, Shapley won the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences &quot;for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.&quot;

== Life and career ==

Lloyd Shapley was born on June 2, 1923, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the sons of astronomers Harlow Shapley and Martha Betz Shapley, both from Missouri. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and was a student at Harvard when he was drafted in 1943. He served in the United States Army Air Corps in Chengdu, China and received the Bronze Star decoration for breaking the Soviet weather code.

After the war, Shapley returned to Harvard and graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1948. After working for one year at the RAND Corporation, he went to Princeton University where he received a Ph.D. in 1953 based on the thesis &quot;Additive and non-additive set functions&quot;. His thesis and post-doctoral work introduced the Shapley value and the core solution in game theory. Shapley defined game theory as &quot;a mathematical study of conflict and cooperation.&quot; After graduating, he remained at Princeton for a short time before going back to the RAND corporation from 1954 to 1981. In 1950, while a graduate student, Shapley invented the board game &quot;So Long Sucker&quot;, along with Mel Hausner, John Forbes Nash, and Martin Shubik. Israeli economist and Nobel Laureate Robert Aumann considered Shapley to be &quot;the greatest game theorist of all time.&quot;
From 1981 until his death, Shapley was a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), serving at the time of his death as a professor emeritus there, affiliated with the Mathematics and Economics departments. He died on March 12, 2016, in Tucson, Arizona, after suffering from a broken hip, at the age of 92.

Shapley was an expert Kriegspiel player, and an avid baseball fan.

== Contribution ==

Along with the Shapley value, stochastic games, the Bondareva–Shapley theorem (which implies that convex games have non-empty cores), the Shapley–Shubik power index (for weighted or block voting power), the Gale–Shapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem, the concept of a potential game (with Dov Monderer), the Aumann–Shapley pricing, the Harsanyi–Shapley solution, the Snow–Shapley theorem for matrix games, and the Shapley–Folkman lemma &amp; theorem bear his name. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Shapley &quot;may have thought of himself as a mathematician, but he cannot avoid being remembered for his huge contributions to economics&quot;. The American Economic Association noted that Shapley was &quot;one of the giants of game theory and economic theory&quot;.

Besides, his early work with R. N. Snow and Samuel Karlin on matrix games was so complete that little has been added since. He has been instrumental in the development of utility theory, and it was he who laid much of the groundwork for the solution of the problem of the existence of Von Neumann–Morgenstern stable sets. His work with M. Maschler and B. Peleg on the kernel and the nucleolus, and his work with Robert Aumann on non-atomic games and on long-term competition have all appeared in economic theory.

Shapley argued with his sons about whether he should accept the Nobel Prize at all. He opined that his father, the astronomer Harlow Shapley, deserved it more. His sons persuaded him to accept it and accompanied him to Stockholm.

<text>The Transmutation of species and transformism are 18th and early 19th-century ideas about the change of one species into another that preceded Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution through natural selection. The French &quot;Transformisme&quot; was a term used by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1809 for his theory, and other 18th and 19th century proponents of pre-Darwinian evolutionary ideas included Denis Diderot, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Erasmus Darwin, Robert Grant, and Robert Chambers, the anonymous author of the book &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;. Such ideas were associated with 18th century ideas of Deism and human progress. Opposition in the scientific community to these early theories of evolution, led by influential scientists like the anatomists Georges Cuvier and Richard Owen, and the geologist Charles Lyell, was intense. The debate over them was an important stage in the history of evolutionary thought and influenced the subsequent reaction to Darwin&#x27;s theory.

==Terminology==
Transmutation was one of the names commonly used for evolutionary ideas in the 19th century before Charles Darwin published &quot;On The Origin of Species&quot; (1859). Transmutation had previously been used as a term in alchemy to describe the transformation of base metals into gold. Other names for evolutionary ideas used in this period include &quot;the development hypothesis&quot; (one of the terms used by Darwin) and &quot;the theory of regular gradation&quot;, used by William Chilton in the periodical press such as &quot;The Oracle of Reason&quot;. &quot;Transformation&quot; is another word used quite as often as transmutation in this context. These early 19th century evolutionary ideas played an important role in the history of evolutionary thought.

The proto-evolutionary thinkers of the 18th and early 19th century had to invent terms to label their ideas, but it was first Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter who used the term &quot;transmutation&quot; to refer to species who have had biological changes through hybridization.

The terminology did not settle down until some time after the publication of the &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. The word &quot;evolved&quot; in a modern sense was first used in 1826 in an anonymous paper published in Robert Jameson&#x27;s journal and &quot;evolution&quot; was a relative late-comer which can be seen in Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Social Statics&quot; of 1851, and at least one earlier example, but was not in general use until about 1865–70.

==Historical development==

===Ideas before the 18th century===
In the 10th and 11th centuries, Ibn Miskawayh&#x27;s &quot;Al-Fawz al-Kabir (الفوز الأكبر)&quot;, and the Brethren of Purity&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (رسائل إخوان الصفا‎)&quot; developed ideas about changes in biological species. 
In 1993, Muhammad Hamidullah described the ideas in lectures:

[These books] state that God first created matter and invested it with energy for development. Matter, therefore, adopted the form of vapour which assumed the shape of water in due time. The next stage of development was mineral life. Different kinds of stones developed [over the] course of [time, their] highest form being mirjan (coral). It is a stone which has in it branches like those of a tree. After mineral life evolves vegetation. The evolution of vegetation culminates with a tree which bears the qualities of an animal. This is the date-palm. It has male and female genders. It does not wither if all its branches are chopped but it dies when the head is cut off. The date-palm is therefore considered the highest among the trees and resembles the lowest among animals. Then is born the lowest of animals. It evolves into an ape. This is not the statement of Darwin. This is what Ibn Maskawayh states and this is precisely what is written in the Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa. The Muslim thinkers state that ape then evolved into a lower kind of a barbarian man. He then became a superior human being. Man becomes a saint, a prophet. He evolves into a higher stage and becomes an angel. The one higher to angels is indeed none but God. Everything begins from Him and everything returns to Him.

In the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun further developed these ideas. According to some commentators, statements in his 1377 work, the Muqaddimah anticipate the
biological theory of evolution.

Robert Hooke proposed in a speech to the Royal Society in the late 17th century that species vary, change, and especially become extinct. His “Discourse of Earthquakes” was based on comparisons made between fossils, especially the modern pearly nautilus and the curled shells of ammonites.

=== 18th and early 19th century ===
In the 18th century, Jacques-Antoine des Bureaux claimed a &quot;genealogical ascent of species&quot;. He argued that through crossbreeding and hybridization in reproduction, &quot;progressive organization&quot; occurred, allowing organisms to change and more complex species to develop.

Simultaneously, Retif de la Bretonne wrote &quot;La decouverte australe par un homme-volant&quot; (1781) and &quot;La philosophie de monsieur Nicolas&quot; (1796), which encapsulated his view that more complex species, such as mankind, had developed step-by-step from &quot;less perfect&quot; animals. De la Bretonne believed that living forms undergo constant change. Although he believed in constant change, he took a very different approach from Diderot: chance and blind combinations of atoms, in de la Bretonne&#x27;s opinion, were not the cause of transmutation. De la Bretonne argued that all species had developed from more primitive organisms, and that nature aimed to reach perfection.

Denis Diderot, chief editor of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, spent his time poring over scientific theories attempting to explain rock strata and the diversity of fossils. Geological and fossil evidence was presented to him as contributions to Encyclopedia articles, chief among them &quot;Mammoth&quot;, &quot;Fossil&quot;, and &quot;Ivory Fossil&quot;, all of which noted the existence of mammoth bones in Siberia. As a result of this geological and fossil evidence, Diderot believed that species were mutable. Particularly, he argued that organisms metamorphosized over millennia, resulting in species changes. In Diderot&#x27;s theory of transformationism, random chance plays a large role in allowing species to change, develop and become extinct, as well as having new species form. Specifically, Diderot believed that given randomness and an infinite number of times, all possible scenarios would manifest themselves. He proposed that this randomness was behind the development of new traits in offspring and as a result the development and extinction of species.

Diderot drew from Leonardo da Vinci’s comparison of the leg structure of a human and a horse as proof of the interconnectivity of species. He saw this experiment as demonstrating that nature could continually try out new variations. Additionally, Diderot argued that organic molecules and organic matter possessed an inherent consciousness, which allowed the smallest particles of organic matter to organize into fibers, then a network, and then organs. The idea that organic molecules have consciousness was derived from both Maupertuis and Lucretian texts. Overall, Diderot’s musings all fit together as a &quot;composite transformist philosophy&quot;, one dependent on the randomness inherent to nature as a transformist mechanism.

==== Erasmus Darwin ====
Erasmus Darwin developed a theory of universal transformation. His major works, The Botanic Garden (1792), Zoonomia (1794–96), and The Temple of Nature all touched on the transformation of organic creatures. In both The Botanic Garden and The Temple of Nature, Darwin used poetry to describe his ideas regarding species. In Zoonomia, however, Erasmus clearly articulates (as a more scientific text) his beliefs about the connections between organic life. He notes particularly that some plants and animals have &quot;useless appendages&quot;, which have gradually changed from their original, useful states. Additionally, Darwin relied on cosmological transformation as a crucial aspect of his theory of transformation, making a connection between William Herschel’s approach to natural historical cosmology and the changing aspects of plants and animals.

Erasmus believed that life had one origin, a common ancestor, which he referred to as the &quot;filament&quot; of life. He used his understanding of chemical transmutation to justify the spontaneous generation of this filament. His geological study of Derbyshire and the sea- shells and fossils which he found there helped him to come to the conclusion that complex life had developed from more primitive forms (Laniel-Musitelli). Erasmus was an early proponent of what we now refer to as &quot;adaptations&quot;, albeit through a different transformist mechanism – he argued that sexual reproduction could pass on acquired traits through the father’s contribution to the embryon. These changes, he believed, were mainly driven by the three great needs of life: lust, food, and security. Erasmus proposed that these acquired changes gradually altered the physical makeup of organisms as a result of the desires of plants and animals. Notably, he describes insects developing from plants, a grand example of one species transforming into another.

Erasmus Darwin relied on Lucretian philosophy to form a theory of universal change. He proposed that both organic and inorganic matter changed throughout the course of the universe, and that plants and animals could pass on acquired traits to their progeny. His view of universal transformation placed time as a driving force in the universe’s journey towards improvement. In addition, Erasmus believed that nature had some amount of agency in this inheritance. Darwin spun his own story of how nature began to develop from the ocean, and then slowly became more diverse and more complex. His transmutation theory relied heavily on the needs which drove animal competition, as well as the results of this contest between both animals and plants.

Charles Darwin acknowledged his grandfather’s contribution to the field of transmutation in his synopsis of Erasmus’ life, The Life of Erasmus Darwin. Darwin collaborated with Ernst Krause to write a forward on Krause&#x27;s Erasmus Darwin und Seine Stellung in Der Geschichte Der Descendenz-Theorie, which translates into Erasmus Darwin and His Place in the History of the Descent Theory. Krause explains Erasmus&#x27; motivations for arguing for the theory of descent, including Darwin&#x27;s connection with and correspondence with Rousseau, which may have influenced how he saw the world.

==== Lamarck ====

Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed a hypothesis on the transmutation of species in &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot; (1809). Lamarck did not believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which he sometimes described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck also recognized that species were adapted to their environment. He explained this observation by saying that the same nervous fluid driving increasing complexity, also caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of that organ, just as muscles are affected by exercise. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that became closely associated with his name and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.

==== Ideas after Lamarck ====
The German Abraham Gottlob Werner believed in geological transformism. Specifically, Werner argued that the Earth undergoes irreversible and continuous change. The Edinburgh school, a radical British school of comparative anatomy, fostered a lot of debate around natural history. Edinburgh, which included the surgeon Robert Knox and the anatomist Robert Grant, was closely in touch with Lamarck&#x27;s school of French &quot;Transformationism&quot;, which contained scientists such as Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Grant developed Lamarck&#x27;s and Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s ideas of transmutation and evolutionism, investigating homology to prove common descent. As a young student Charles Darwin joined Grant in investigations of the life cycle of marine animals. He also studied geology under professor Robert Jameson whose journal published an anonymous paper in 1826 praising &quot;Mr. Lamarck&quot; for explaining how the higher animals had &quot;evolved&quot; from the &quot;simplest worms&quot; – this was the first use of the word &quot;evolved&quot; in a modern sense. Professor Jameson was a Wernerian, which allowed him to consider transformation theories and foster the interest in transformism among his students. Jameson&#x27;s course closed with lectures on the &quot;Origin of the Species of Animals&quot;.
==== &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; ====
The computing pioneer Charles Babbage published his unofficial &quot;Ninth Bridgewater Treatise&quot; in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with &quot;ad hoc&quot; miracles each time a new species was required. In 1844 the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers anonymously published an influential and extremely controversial book of popular science entitled &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for the origins of the solar system and life on earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed an ascent of animals with current animals being branches off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations led to the unfolding of a preordained orthogenetic plan woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Robert Grant, but its implication that humans were just the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. Both conservatives like Adam Sedgwick, and radical materialists like Thomas Henry Huxley, who disliked Chambers&#x27; implications of preordained progress, were able to find scientific inaccuracies in the book that they could disparage. Darwin himself openly deplored the author&#x27;s &quot;poverty of intellect&quot;, and dismissed it as a &quot;literary curiosity&quot;. However, the high profile of the public debate over &quot;Vestiges&quot;, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, and its popular success, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin&#x27;s theory a decade later. It also influenced some younger naturalists, including Alfred Russel Wallace, to take an interest in the idea of transmutation.

==Ideological motivations for theories of transmutation==
The proponents of transmutation were almost all inclined to Deism—the idea, popular among many 18th century Western intellectuals that God had initially created the universe, but then left it to operate and develop through natural law rather than through divine intervention. Thinkers like Erasmus Darwin saw the transmutation of species as part of this development of the world through natural law, which they saw as a challenge to traditional Christianity. They also believed that human history was progressive, which was another idea becoming increasingly popular in the 18th century. They saw progress in human history as being mirrored by the development of life from the simple to the complex over the history of the Earth. This connection was very clear in the work of Erasmus Darwin and Robert Chambers.

==Opposition to transmutation==
Ideas about the transmutation of species were strongly associated with the anti-Christen materialism and radical political ideas of the Enlightenment and were greeted with hostility by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by re-population, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier&#x27;s arguments and his reputation as a leading scientist helped keep transmutational ideas out of the scientific mainstream for decades.

In Britain, where the philosophy of natural theology remained influential, William Paley wrote the book &quot;Natural Theology&quot; with its famous watchmaker analogy, at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin. Geologists influenced by natural theology, such as Buckland and Sedgwick, made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck and Grant, and Sedgwick wrote a famously harsh review of &quot;The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;. Although the geologist Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology, he also believed in the immutability of species, and in his &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; (1830–1833) he criticized and dismissed Lamarck&#x27;s theories of development. Instead, he advocated a form of progressive creation, in which each species had its &quot;centre of creation&quot; and was designed for this particular habitat, but would go extinct when this habitat changed.
Another source of opposition to transmutation was a school of naturalists who were influenced by the German philosophers and naturalists associated with idealism, such as Goethe, Hegel and Lorenz Oken. Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator. They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology, as well as in the fossil record, but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought, with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity. Owen developed the idea of &quot;archetypes&quot; in the divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies, such as vertebrate limbs. Owen was concerned by the political implications of the ideas of transmutationists like Robert Grant, and he led a public campaign by conservatives that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community. In his famous 1841 paper, which coined the term dinosaur for the giant reptiles discovered by Buckland and Gideon Mantell, Owen argued that these reptiles contradicted the transmutational ideas of Lamarck because they were more sophisticated than the reptiles of the modern world. Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory, but the harsh treatment of Grant, along with the controversy surrounding &quot;Vestiges&quot;, would be factors in his decision to ensure that his theory was fully supported by facts and arguments before publishing his ideas.

<text>Autograph Collector Magazine was a U.S. magazine for autograph collectors. The magazine was started in 1986. They offered news, celebrity interviews and addresses, in-person signing event listings, counterfeit-detection articles, and in-depth articles on collecting autographs from people in various professions, from sports to Hollywood to business and more. The magazine was, in its later incarnation, a web-only publication. The print version was previously published on a monthly basis.

The magazine was headquartered in Corona, California.

<doc id="1135569" wikidata="Q20948" url="?curid=1135569" title="Acianthus">
<text>Acianthus, commonly known as mosquito orchids, is a genus of about twelve species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Mosquito orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single, heart-shaped, usually ground-hugging leaf and one to many small, green, pinkish or purplish flowers on a fleshy stalk. They are found in New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand.

==Description==
Orchids in the genus &quot;Acianthus&quot; are terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a single egg-shaped, heart-shaped or lobed leaf at the base. They have small, roughly spherical, underground tubers from which the flower stems arise. Lacking true roots, they have root-like stolons which develop &quot;daughter&quot; tubers at their ends. These orchids spend the dry, summer months dormant until, following late-summer or autumn rains, the leaf appears. The leaf is , sometimes ground-hugging, more usually held above the ground and is often purplish-red on the lower surface. Sometimes the leaves of plants with flowers are different from those lacking them. The leaves of all Australian species are very similar, making them hard to identify to species level in the absence of flowers.

Flowers appear in the cooler months, usually in autumn, winter or spring, There are one to many resupinate small, green, pinkish or purplish flowers in diameter. The flowers are held on an upright, narrow but fleshy stalk, blend in with their surrounding and often resemble mosquitoes. The sepals are longer than the petals and usually have a long, thin extension on their end. The sepal is broader than the ones and sometimes forms a hood over the column. The sepals project forward beneath the labellum and the petals spread widely or curve backwards against the ovary. The labellum is heart-shaped and has a prominent callus. The fruit is a thin-walled, glabrous capsule, containing a large number of winged seeds.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 in &quot;Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae&quot;. He described three species (&quot;A. fornicatus&quot;, &quot;A. exsertus&quot; and &quot;A. caudatus&quot;) but did not nominate a type species. Orchids in this genus are closely related to those in the genus &quot;Caladenia&quot;. Some Australian species included in &quot;Acianthus&quot; were at one time transferred to &quot;Acianthella&quot;, but are now accepted in &quot;Acianthus&quot;.

The genus name (&quot;Acianthus&quot;) is derived from the Greek &quot;ake&quot; or &quot;akis&quot;, &quot;a point, needle&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; &quot;flower&quot; referring to the pointed and the floral segments.

===Species===
The following is a list of &quot;Acianthus&quot; species accepted by Australian Plant Census as at March 2022, apart from &quot;A. sinclairii&quot; that is accepted by the New Zealand Plant Conservation Network:

*&quot;Acianthus apprimus&quot; – early mosquito orchid (New South Wales)
*&quot;Acianthus borealis&quot; – northern mosquito orchid (Queensland)
*&quot;Acianthus caudatus&quot; – mayfly orchid (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania)
*&quot;Acianthus collinus&quot; – hooded mosquito orchid (New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria)
*&quot;Acianthus cuneatus&quot; (New South Wales)
*&quot;Acianthus exiguus&quot; – tiny mosquito orchid (New South Wales)
*&quot;Acianthus exsertus&quot; – gnat orchid, large mosquito orchid (Queensland, New South Wales, ACT, Victoria )
*&quot;Acianthus fornicatus&quot; – pixie-caps (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria)
*&quot;Acianthus ledwardii&quot; – Ledward&#x27;s mosquito orchid (Queensland)
*&quot;Acianthus pusillus&quot; – small mosquito orchid (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania)
*&quot;Acianthus saxatilis&quot; (Queensland)
*&quot;Acianthus sinclairii&quot; – heart-leaved orchid, pixie cap (New Zealand)
Plants of the World Online considers &quot;A. apprimus&quot;, &quot;A. borealis&quot;, &quot;A. collinus&quot;, &quot;A. exiguus&quot; to be synonyms of &quot;A. fornicatus&quot; and in addition accepts two further species:
*&quot;Acianthus amplexicaulis&quot; (the Australian Plants Census considers this to be a synonym of &quot;Stigmatodactylus amplexicaulis&quot;)
*&quot;Acianthus scopulus&quot; 

==Distribution and habitat==
Of the Australian species of &quot;Acianthus&quot;, 7 are found in New South Wales, 6 in Queensland, 3 in Victoria and 2 in South Australia. The sole New Zealand example, &quot;A. sinclairii&quot; occurs on both North and South Islands, as well as on Raoul, Stewart, Chatham and Three Kings Islands.

Mosquito orchids species grow in small groups in forests on decaying litter, occasionally on partially decayed logs. They sometimes form dense vegetative colonies, in sheltered forest or heathland, and are often found underneath shrubs and bracken.

==Ecology==
The labellum of &quot;Acianthus&quot; species produces a sweet nectar which is contained in a sunken area at the base of the labellum. The flowers of Australian species open in sequence up the flowering spike, each flower open for a few days, and are d by fungus gnats from the families Anisopodidae, Sciaridae and Mycetophilidae. Usually only a small percentage of the plants in a colony have flowers. Flies on &quot;Acianthus caudatus&quot; have been observed to move up the labellum, probing with their proboscis until they reach the nectar, where the up and down &quot;pumping&quot; action of their bodies brings them into contact with the viscidium and pollinia which then adhere to the insect&#x27;s body. When these are carried to another flower, a similar action causes the pollinia to attach to the receptive stigma.

==Use in horticulture==
Mosquito orchids are easy to grow in plastic or ceramic pots. They need to be watered regularly except when dormant over summer and to be repotted every one or two years.

<text>The Lincoln Tomb is the final resting place of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States; his wife Mary Todd Lincoln; and three of their four sons: Edward, William, and Thomas. It is located in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, Illinois.

Constructed of granite, the tomb has a tall, story-and-a-half base in trapezoidal form, surmounted by an obelisk, with a semicircular receiving room entranceway on one end and a semicircular crypt or burial room opposite. On the exterior, four flights of balustraded stairs lead to a level terrace. The balustrade extends around the terrace to form a parapet, and there are several bronze statues, reliefs, and stone carvings located at the base of the obelisk. The obelisk rises 117 feet (36m) high.

A bronze recasting of Gutzon Borglum&#x27;s head of Lincoln stands on a pedestal in front of the entrance way; Borglum&#x27;s original marble bust is in the U.S. Capitol. Inside the tomb&#x27;s ground level entrance is a rotunda with connecting hallways to the burial room. Marble is used throughout the interior, and several well-known, specially cast bronze statues of Lincoln are displayed in the entrance room and hallways. A stained glass window and flags adorn the crypt, which is centered around an inscribed red marble monument.

At the close of the ceremonies and events marking Lincoln&#x27;s death, his body was placed in a nearby receiving tomb and later in the state tomb. The mausoleum is owned and administered by the State of Illinois as &quot;Lincoln Tomb State Historic Site.&quot; It was designated one of the first National Historic Landmarks in 1960, and thus became one of the first sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, when that designation was created.

On April 16, 1865, two days after President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, a group of Springfield citizens formed the National Lincoln Monument Association and spearheaded a drive for funds to construct a memorial or tomb. Upon arrival of the funeral train on May 3, Lincoln lay in state in the Illinois State Capitol for one night. After funeral and burial services the next day, his coffin was placed in a receiving vault at Oak Ridge Cemetery, the site Mrs. Lincoln requested for burial. In December, her husband&#x27;s remains were removed to a temporary vault not far from the proposed memorial site. In 1871, three years after laborers had begun constructing the tomb, the body of Lincoln and those of the three youngest of his sons were placed in crypts in the unfinished structure.

In 1874, upon completion of the memorial, which had been designed by Larkin Goldsmith Mead, Lincoln&#x27;s remains were interred in a marble sarcophagus in the center of a chamber known as the &quot;catacombs,&quot; or burial room. In 1876, however, after two Chicago criminals failed in an attempt to steal Lincoln&#x27;s body and hold it for ransom, the National Lincoln Monument Association hid it in another part of the memorial, first under wood and other debris and then buried in the ground within the tomb. When Mrs. Lincoln died in 1882, her remains were placed with those of Lincoln, but in 1887 both bodies were reburied in a brick vault beneath the floor of the burial room.

By 1895, the year the State acquired the memorial, it had fallen into disrepair. During a rebuilding and restoration program from 1899 to 1901, all five caskets were moved to a nearby subterranean vault. Following completion of the restoration, State officials returned them to the burial room and placed that of Lincoln in the sarcophagus it had occupied in 1874–76. Within a few months, however, at the request of Robert Todd Lincoln, the President&#x27;s only surviving son, Lincoln&#x27;s remains were moved to their final resting place – a concrete vault below the surface of the burial room. In 1930–31 the State reconstructed the interior of the memorial in an Art Deco style. Rededicated in the later year by President Herbert Hoover, it has undergone little change since that time. The Lincoln Tomb was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

==Design and layout==

The tomb is in the center of a 12½ acre (51,000 m2) plot. Constructed of granite from Biddeford, Maine, dressed at Quincy, Massachusetts, it has a rectangular base surmounted by a -high obelisk and a semicircular entranceway. A bronze reproduction by sculptor Gutzon Borglum of his head of Lincoln in the U.S. Capitol rests on a pedestal in front of the entranceway. Four flights of balustraded stairs—two flanking the entrance at the front and two at the rear—lead to a level terrace. The balustrade extends around the terrace to form a parapet. Originally open to the public, the terrace has since been closed due to safety concerns.

In the center of the terrace, a large and ornate base supports the obelisk. On the walls of the base are 40 hewn stones, cut to represent raised shields, 37 are engraved with the abbreviation of a State at the time the tomb was built. The remaining 3 are marked U, S, A. Each shield is connected to another by two raised bands, and thus the group forms an unbroken chain encircling the base. Four bronze statues adorn the corners of the latter. They represent the infantry, navy, artillery, and cavalry of the Civil War period. In front of the obelisk and above the entrance stands a full-length statue of Lincoln. The tomb&#x27;s design architect and sculptor, Larkin G. Mead, designed and executed these carvings and statues.

The interior of the memorial, constructed of marble from Minnesota, Missouri, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Utah, Italy, Spain, France, and Belgium, contains a rotunda, a burial room, and connecting corridors. A down-scaled bronze prototype by Daniel Chester French of his 1920 statue in the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., dominates the entrance foyer. The walls of the rotunda are decorated with 16 marble pilasters, which are separated by marble panels. The pilasters symbolize Lincoln and the 15 presidents who preceded him. The room also contains 36 bronze panels, one for each state at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s death. The ceiling is of palladium leaf.

Corridors lead from the rotunda to the burial room at the rear of the memorial. Located in niches along the corridor walls are eight statues by prominent sculptors depicting various phases of Lincoln&#x27;s life. Four bronze tablets on the walls are engraved with the Farewell Address, the Gettysburg Address, a portion of the Second Inaugural Address, and a biographical sketch. Large gold stars in sets of 12 at each corner of the memorial represent the 48 states in the Union at the time of its 1930 redecoration.

The burial room features black and white marble walls and a ceiling of gold leaf. At its center stands the memorial monument, a 7-ton block of reddish marble inscribed with Lincoln&#x27;s name and the years he lived. It marks the approximate location of the burial vault, which is 30 inches behind and 10 feet below. Nine flags are arranged in a semicircle around the cenotaph. Seven of them—the State flags of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois—commemorate the homes of Lincoln and his ancestors. The eighth and ninth are the U.S. flag and the Presidential flag. The inscription &quot;Now he belongs to the ages,&quot; reputedly spoken by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s death, is inscribed in the wall above a stained glass window. Along the south wall of the burial room are four crypts containing the remains of Mrs. Lincoln and three of Lincoln&#x27;s four sons, Edward, Willie, and Tad (the eldest, Robert Todd Lincoln, is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, alongside his wife and son).

The tomb was built with additional crypts for members of Lincoln&#x27;s family in addition to the four spaces already used. However, as the remaining members of Lincoln&#x27;s family chose to be buried elsewhere, the other crypts remain empty.

The original landscaping for the site was designed by William Saunders, a prominent landscape designer and federal employee who had previously designed the Oakridge Cemetery and the Soldiers National Cemetery at Gettysburg where Lincoln had delivered his famous speech.

==Adjacent memorials==
Also part of the site overseen by the State of Illinois, and a short distance from the tomb, three war memorials have been erected:
* The World War II Illinois Veterans Memorial was dedicated in December 2004. This memorial honors the 987,000 Illinois men and women who served in World War II and the 22,000 who gave their lives. Its focal point is a white 22-ton concrete globe flanked on two sides by black granite walls. Stainless steel buttons on the globe identify major battles, and quotations from military leaders, and Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman are engraved on the wall.
* The Korean War Memorial honors 1,748 Illinoisans killed during the 1950-53 Korean War. This memorial was dedicated on June 16, 1996. The memorial consists of a twelve-foot-tall bronze bell, with a diameter of twelve feet, mounted on a granite base. At the circumference of the bell are four niches, each with a larger-than-life figure representing a branch of the armed services. Inscribed on the base are the names of Illinoisans killed in Korea. A carillon system in the Memorial plays brief musical programs at regular intervals.
* The Vietnam Veterans Memorial honors the almost 3,000 Illinoisans killed during the Vietnam War, and was dedicated in 1988. The memorial has a circular layout allowing visitors to enter the interior courtyard from any direction. The names of those killed or missing in action are on five granite slabs, each slab representing one of the branches of the United States Military.

<text>Progressive disclosure is an interaction design pattern used to make applications easier to learn and less error-prone. It does so by deferring some advanced or rarely-used features to a secondary screen and designing workflows where information is revealed when it becomes relevant to the current task.

A classic example of this pattern is the print dialog in macOS. While printing a page, the print dialog shows only a small subset of choices. If the user wants more advanced options, they can click the &quot;Show Details&quot; button to reveal these features in a secondary screen.

In the physical world, progressive disclosure is used by modern theme park designers. Long waiting lines for rides can scare away visitors, so only a small segment of the line is made visible from any vantage point. As people move ahead in line, they only get to see discrete portions of the entire line. This design can make waiting more bearable for those in line.

== History ==
Kristina Hooper Woolsey, a founding member of the Apple Human Interface Group, wrote in 1985 what could be considered as the seminal idea for selectively disclosing to new users how a system works:&quot;In the design of interfaces one must also consider carefully how one selectively informs a user about a particular system, providing well-chosen bits and pieces that can constitute a general understanding of a system.&quot;

<doc id="1135580" wikidata="Q1750774" url="?curid=1135580" title="Roger Rees">
<text>Roger Rees (5 May 1944 – 10 July 2015) was a Welsh actor and director. He won an Olivier Award and a Tony Award for his performance as the lead in &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot;. He also received Obie Awards for his role in &quot;The End of the Day&quot; and as co-director of &quot;Peter and the Starcatcher&quot;. Rees was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in November 2015.

On television, he played Robin Colcord in &quot;Cheers&quot; and Lord John Marbury in &quot;The West Wing&quot;. He also appeared as the Sheriff of Rottingham in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;.

==Early life==
Rees was born in Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire, Wales, the son of Doris Louise (née Smith), a shop clerk, and William John Rees, a police officer. He and his parents moved to Balham, London, where he grew up. He studied art at the Camberwell College of Arts and the Slade School of Fine Art, turning to acting when he was painting backdrops at the Wimbledon Theatre and was asked to fill a part in a play.

==Career==

Rees continued his career with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He played Malcolm in the acclaimed Trevor Nunn 1976 stage and 1978 television production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Rees created the title role in the original production of &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, David Edgar&#x27;s stage adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel, winning a Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a New Play in 1980 and a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play in 1982. A recorded version of the play also earned him an Emmy nomination in 1983. He also starred in the original production of &quot;The Real Thing&quot; by Tom Stoppard at the Strand Theatre in London in 1982.

Rees began to work in television during the 1980s, appearing opposite Laurence Olivier in &quot;The Ebony Tower&quot; (1984). That same year, Rees portrayed Fred Hollywell in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which he also narrated, starring George C. Scott as Scrooge. In 1986, he played William Tyndale in &quot;God&#x27;s Outlaw&quot;. From 1988 to 1991 he starred in the British sitcom &quot;Singles&quot;, with co-star Judy Loe. From 1989 to 1993, he appeared intermittently on the long-running American television series &quot;Cheers&quot; as the English business tycoon Robin Colcord, a love interest for Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley). He played British Ambassador Lord John Marbury in several episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot; from 2000 to 2005. His later television appearances also include &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; as substitute teacher Mr. Racine, and James MacPherson on &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;. His film career began in the 1980s. Rees played the Sheriff of Rottingham in the Mel Brooks movie &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993). Rees&#x27; later film appearances include &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006).

Continuing his work in the theatre through the 1990s, both as an actor and a director, Rees was awarded an Obie Award for his 1992 performance in the Off-Broadway play &quot;The End of the Day&quot;. In 1995, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role in &quot;Indiscretions&quot;. He recorded many audiobooks, including &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; by Anne Rice.

From November 2004 to October 2007, Rees was artistic director of the Williamstown Theatre Festival, only the fourth person to hold the post in its half-century history. He replaced Nathan Lane in the role of Gomez Addams in the Broadway musical adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, on 22 March 2011 and remained until the end of the run on 31 December 2011.

In 2012, Rees took his one-man Shakespeare show, &quot;What You Will&quot;, to London&#x27;s West End, playing a three-week engagement at the Apollo Theatre.

In 2013, Rees directed Crispin Whitell&#x27;s play, &quot;The Primrose Path&quot;, at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis.

In 2014, Rees directed &quot;Dog and Pony&quot;, a musical written by Rick Elice and Michael Patrick Walker, which had its world premiere at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego.

His last role was as Anton Schell in the musical version of &quot;The Visit&quot;, opposite Chita Rivera, which opened on Broadway on 23 April 2015 and closed on 14 June 2015. Rees left the production in May 2015 owing to his illness.

Rees was to have directed a new musical written by Elice and Will Van Dyke, &quot;Magnificent Climb&quot;, in the fall of 2016 at MCC Theater in New York City. He was also scheduled to perform his one-man Shakespeare show, &quot;What You Will&quot; in New York in the autumn of 2015, and had hoped to return to the Royal Shakespeare Company for a stint in &quot;Don Quixote&quot; in 2016. He was inducted into the exclusive entertainment fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats, as a full member.

==Personal life==
Rees lived in the United States for more than 25 years and became a naturalized American citizen in 1989. He converted to Judaism in the 1980s. Rees married his partner of 33 years, playwright Rick Elice, in 2011, shortly after same-sex marriage in New York was legalised. Rees and Elice also collaborated professionally, including as co-playwrights of the comedic thriller &quot;Double Double&quot;. Elice co-wrote (with Marshall Brickman) the libretto for &quot;The Addams Family&quot; musical, the cast of which Rees had joined on 22 March 2011. In 2012, Elice and Rees received Tony Award nominations for Elice&#x27;s stage adaptation and Rees&#x27; co-direction (with Alex Timbers), respectively, of &quot;Peter and the Starcatcher&quot;. In October 2017, Elice wrote a memoir of his life with Rees, entitled &quot;Finding Roger: An Improbably Theatrical Love Story&quot;.

===Illness and death===
After a diagnosis of brain cancer in October 2014, Rees focused his energy on his commitment to playing opposite Chita Rivera on Broadway in &quot;The Visit&quot;, the final musical written by John Kander and Fred Ebb. While undergoing two brain surgeries, two courses of radiation and ongoing chemotherapy, Rees managed to rehearse, preview and open in &quot;The Visit&quot; on 23 April 2015. By the middle of May, it had become too difficult for him to speak, and he left the show. Rees died at age 71 at his home in New York City on 10 July 2015. On Wednesday, 15 July 2015, the marquee lights at all the theatres on Broadway were dimmed in his honour. His ashes were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean. Two months later, there was a memorial service for him at Broadway&#x27;s New Amsterdam Theatre. On 16 November 2015, Rees was inducted, posthumously, into the Broadway Theatre Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1135583" wikidata="Q516282" url="?curid=1135583" title="Battle of Raszyn (1809)">
<text>The first Battle of Raszyn was fought on 19 April 1809 between armies of the Austrian Empire under Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and the Duchy of Warsaw under Józef Antoni Poniatowski, as part of the War of the Fifth Coalition in the Napoleonic Wars. The battle was not decisive, but it did result in the Austrians obtaining their goal by capturing the Polish capital Warsaw.

==Battle==
The battlefield&#x27;s terrain is dominated by several villages and by the river Utrata, which during the April thaw is usually unfordable. The only way to cross the river is at the ponds of Raszyn, Dawidy or Michalowice, which were all under Polish control.

After a preparatory cannonade starting at 14.00, the Austrian infantry attacked the Polish screening forces around 15.00. The Poles gradually yielded terrain. Austrian attempts to outflank the Polish position near Jaworowo were unsuccessful. After the village of Falenty was captured at 16.00 Poniatowski launched a counterattack which evicted the Austrians from the town and re-established the Polish line. Around 17.00 a combined attack was launched against Raszyn. Repulsed by the Saxon units, the Austrians called up reinforcements and took the town around 19.00 but were unable to progress beyond the last houses of the village. The Poles again counterattacked at 21.00 and drove the Austrians from Raszyn but were unable to recapture the causeway. Fighting progressed until 22.00 when the Poles evacuated the battlefield.

==Aftermath==
As a result, the Austrians captured Warsaw, and the first days after that Polish society perceived it as a new partition. This allowed some sources to claim that the Austrians had won the battle. Polish historiography does not agree with this statement, which claims that the strategic objectives of the Austrians were not fulfilled, which ultimately led to negative actions throughout the war.

In the following weeks Greater Poland was defended by the Corps of General Henryk Dąbrowski and the Polish cavalry seized Lwów. Finally, Poniatowski left only a small force near Warsaw to prevent the Austrians from leaving it and moved the rest of his forces southwards, which led to capturing the city of Kraków.

On 14 October 1809 the Treaty of Schönbrunn was signed between Austria and France. According to it, Austria lost approximately 50,000 square kilometres of land inhabited by over 1,900,000 people. The territories annexed by the Duchy of Warsaw included the lands of Zamość and Kraków as well as 50% of income of the Wieliczka salt mines.

In the opinion of the Polish military historian, General Marian Kukiel, the Battle of Raszyn can be characterized as follows:
“The Battle of Raszyn on the Polish side is an example of pure defense; Poniatowski left the initiative to the enemy until the end, which is understandable considering the terrible ratio of forces and the size of the front. On the Austrian side, an energetic frontal attack on two tactical keys, Falenty and Raszyn, was combined in both cases with a maneuver on the flank of the appropriate group of our troops. However, there was no large-scale maneuver, although the advantage in numbers made it easier for the Austrians to bypass and surround our position. This is explained only by disregard of the enemy, who was considered before the battle as a kind of unruly and untrained militia.”

Afterwards, Poniatowski was presented with the &quot;grand-aigle de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, a saber of honor, and a lancer&#x27;s shako.

The Battle of Raszyn is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;RASZYN 19 IV 1809&quot;.

<text>The Victor Film Company was a motion picture company formed in 1912 by movie star Florence Lawrence and her husband, Harry Solter. The company established Victor Studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, when early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based there at the beginning of the 20th century. 

At a time when actors received no screen credits, Carl Laemmle of the Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP) had begun promoting Lawrence&#x27;s name and image, making her into America&#x27;s &quot;First Movie Star.&quot;

Harry Solter had already been directing Lawrence at IMP and with their own studio, he made a large number of film shorts starring his wife, many of which co-starred Owen Moore and King Baggot. In addition, the studio teamed Moore with Fritzi Brunette in several of its productions. However, with the amalgamation of several studios to create the colossal Universal Film Manufacturing Company, Lawrence and Solter had little choice but to sell out in 1913. With Solter no longer involved, Universal brought in young directors such as Allan Dwan and James Kirkwood, Sr. The Victor entity remained in use until 1917 when it was absorbed completely into Universal.

<doc id="1135593" wikidata="Q892159" url="?curid=1135593" title="Religion in the United Kingdom">
<text>Christianity is the dominant religion in the United Kingdom. Results of the 2021 Census for England and Wales showed that Christianity is the largest religion (though makes up less than half of the population), followed by the non-religious, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Among Christians, Anglicanism is the most common denomination, followed by Catholicism, Presbyterianism, Methodism, Unitarianism, and Baptism. Results for the 2022 census in Scotland the majority (51%) had no religion, but that 38.8% of the Scottish population identified as Christian (of which 20% identified with the Church of Scotland and 13% with the Catholic Church).

The Church of England is the state church of England, whilst the strictly Presbyterian Church of Scotland is likewise the official religion and state church of Scotland. The Church of England defines itself as neither fully reformed Protestant nor fully Catholic. The Monarch of the United Kingdom is the supreme governor of the Church. Both Northern Ireland and Wales have no state religion since the Irish Church Act 1869 and the Welsh Church Act 1914, respectively.

A large number of individuals have no religious affiliation, and many others are only nominally affiliated, and neither believe nor practice. Surveys find that agnosticism, nontheism, atheism and the like are views shared by a majority of Britons. In addition to secularisation, post-WWII immigration turned the religious landscape more diverse, adding non-Christian beliefs and traditions and turning society somewhat multi-faith.

==History==
===Prehistory–11th century: Paganism and Christianisation===

Before the Roman conquest of Britain, various types of British paganism were practiced which included ancestor worship. The history of Christianity in Britain begins at the latest in the 3rd century, when groups such as tradesmen, immigrants and soldiers introduced it to Roman Britain. Christianity seems to have stayed a minority religion throughout the 4th century, with evidence supporting the continuation of the Romano-Celtic religion during this time, and in the early 5th century there are records of British bishops asking for help from Gaul to deal with Pelagianism.

During the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries, Anglo-Saxon forms of Germanic paganism were introduced which became the dominant religion in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. While Bede stated that Christianity was completely absent from these areas, evidence suggests the continuation of small communities. The process of Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England began in the late 6th century with the Gregorian mission, which was later followed by the Hiberno-Scottish mission. The kings in England converted over the course of the 7th century, with Æthelberht being the first to adopt the new religion around 600 whilst Arwald of Wihtwara died as the last heathen Anglo-Saxon king during an invasion in 686 by Cædwalla of Wessex. Nordic forms of Germanic paganism closely related to the Anglo-Saxon traditional religion were introduced to regions of the British Isles in the 9th and 10th centuries by Scandinavian settlers who established the Kingdom of the Isles and the Danelaw. It is generally thought that the settlers in England converted within several generations, with Erik Bloodaxe, the last potentially heathen king in England, dying in 954, however it was adopted more slowly in other parts of the region. Orkney, for example, was not nominally Christianised until around 995 when, according to &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;, Olaf Tryggvason ordered that if the earl and his subjects did not convert, he would be killed and the islands ravaged. Some practices conceived of as heathen such as the worship of heathen gods and the leaving of offerings at trees, were made illegal in law codes in England beginning in the 640 and continuing into the 11th century, with punishments ranging from fines to execution. Other aspects of the pre-Christian culture blended with the incoming customs, however, such as the usage of Germanic words to refer to Christian concepts such as &quot;god&quot;, &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;hell&quot;, and the belief in beings such as dwarfs and elves, which continued into the modern period.

Insular Christianity as it stood between the 6th and 8th centuries retained some idiosyncrasies in terms of liturgy and calendar, but it had been nominally united with Roman Christianity since at least the Synod of Whitby of 664. Still in the Anglo-Saxon period, the archbishops of Canterbury established a tradition of receiving their pallium from Rome to symbolise the authority of the pope.

===12th–16th centuries: High Middle Ages and the Reformation===
The Catholic Church remained the dominant form of Western Christianity in Britain throughout the Middle Ages, but the (Anglican) Church of England became the independent established church in England and Wales in 1534 as a result of the English Reformation. It retains a representation in the UK Parliament and the British monarch is its supreme governor.

In Scotland, the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, established in a separate Scottish Reformation in the sixteenth century, is recognised as the national church. It is not subject to state control and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to &quot;maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government&quot; upon his or her accession.

The adherence to the Catholic Church continued at various levels in different parts of Britain, especially among recusants and in the north of England, but most strongly in Ireland. This would expand in Great Britain, partly due to Irish immigration in the nineteenth century, the Catholic emancipation and the Restoration of the English hierarchy.

===17th–19th centuries: Modernity===
Particularly from the mid-seventeenth century, forms of Protestant nonconformity, including Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers and, later, Methodists, grew outside of the established church. The (Anglican) Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and, as the (Anglican) Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.

The Jews in England were expelled in 1290, readmitted in the 1650s and only emancipated in the 19th century. British Jews had numbered fewer than 10,000 in 1800 but around 120,000 after 1881 when Russian Jews settled permanently in Britain.

===20th–21st centuries: Secularisation and multiculturalism===
The substantial immigration to the United Kingdom after World War II has contributed to the growth of foreign faiths, especially of Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism. Buddhism in the United Kingdom experienced growth partly due to immigration and partly due to conversion (especially when including Secular Buddhism).

As elsewhere in the Western world, religious demographics have become part of the discourse on multiculturalism, with Britain variously described as a post-Christian society, as &quot;multi-faith&quot;, or as secularised. Scholars have suggested multiple possible reasons for the decline, but have not agreed on their relative importance. Martin Wellings lays out the &quot;classical model&quot; of secularisation, while noting that it has been challenged by some scholars.

The familiar starting-point, a classical model of secularisation, argues that religious faith becomes less plausible and religious practice more difficult in advanced industrial and urbanised societies. The breakdown or disruption of traditional communities and norms of behaviour; the spread of a scientific world-view diminishing the scope of the supernatural and the role of God; increasing material affluence promoting self-reliance and this-worldly optimism; and greater awareness and toleration of different creeds and ideas, encouraging religious pluralism and eviscerating commitment to a particular faith, all form components of the case for secularisation. Applied to the British churches in general by Steve Bruce and to Methodism in particular by Robert Currie, this model traces decline back to the Victorian era and charts in the twentieth century &quot;a steady ebbing of the sea of faith&quot;.

==Statistics==
===Religious affiliations===

In the 2011 census, Christianity was the largest religion, stated as their affiliation by 60% of the total population.

Although there was no UK-wide data in the 2001 or the 2011 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, since they are asked only in the Scottish and in the Northern Irish Censuses, using the same principle as applied in the 2001 census, a survey carried out in the end of 2008 by Ipsos MORI and based on a scientifically robust sample, found the population of England and Wales to be 47.0% Anglican, 9.6% Catholic and 8.7% other Christians; 4.8% were Muslim, 3.4% were members of other religions. 5.3% were Agnostics, 6.8% were Atheists and 15.0% were not sure about their religious affiliation or refused to answer to the question.

The 2009 British Social Attitudes Survey, which covers Great Britain but not Northern Ireland, indicated that over 50 per cent would self-classify as not religious at all, 19.9 per cent were part of the Church of England, 9.3% non-denominational Christian, 8.6% Catholic, 2.2% Presbyterian/Church of Scotland, 1.3% Methodist, 0.53% Baptist, 1.17% other Protestant, 0.23% United Reformed Church/Congregational, 0.06% Free Presbyterian, 0.03% Brethren Christian and 0.41% other Christian.

In a 2016 survey conducted by BSA (British Social Attitudes) on religious affiliation; 53% of respondents indicated &#x27;no religion&#x27; and 41% indicated they were Christians, while 6% affiliated with non-Christian religions (Islam, Hinduism, Judaism etc.)

Eurostat&#x27;s Eurobarometer survey in December 2018 found that 53.6% of UK&#x27;s population is Christian, while 6.2% belong to other religions and 40.2% are atheists (30.3% Agnostics, 9.9% Anti-theists). The May 2019 Special Eurobarometer found that 50% were Christians (14% Protestants, 13% Catholics, 7% Orthodox and 16% other Christians), 37% atheist (9% anti-theists, 28% &#x27;nonbelievers and agnostics&#x27;), 5% Muslims (3% Sunnis, 1% Shias, 1% other Muslims), 1% Sikhs, 1% Hindus, fewer than 1% Jews, fewer than 1% Buddhists, 4% other religions, 1% didn&#x27;t know, and 1% refused to answer. The same year Pew Research center estimated that 73% of people in UK were Christian while 23% were unaffiliated and 4% were other religion or did not know.

The wording of the question affects the outcome of polls as is apparent when comparing the results of the Scottish census with that of the English and Welsh census. An ICM poll for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2006 asked the question &quot;Which religion do you yourself belong to?&quot; with a response of 64% stating &quot;Christian&quot; and 26% stating &quot;none&quot;. In the same survey, 63% claimed they are not religious with just 33% claiming they are.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICM/Gaudian 2006&quot;&gt;  Retrieved on 7 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the religious UK population identify themselves as having Christian beliefs, but maybe not as active &quot;church-goers&quot;.

Religions other than Christianity, such as Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and Judaism, have established a presence in the United Kingdom, both through immigration and by attracting converts. Others that have done so include the Baháʼí Faith, Modern paganism, and the Rastafari movement -which has 5000 followers in the UK as of a 2001 census.

The European Social Survey, carried out between 2014 and 2016, found that 70% of people between 16 and 29 were not religious.

===Historical trends since 1900===

*Sources: Based on Historical data/information, Religious Data since 1980s, Eurobarometer 2015 Data, and 2001 &amp; 2011 National U.K. Census. Specifications: Catholics include Roman Catholics (8%) and Anglo-Catholics (5%), Protestants include the majority of Anglicans (Traditional Anglicanism, Anglican Evangelical versions and part of Anglo-Catholics), Mainline Protestant Churches like Methodists or Presbyterians (7%) and Evangelical Protestants (4%), Other Christians historically were British Restoriationist Churches inspired by Mainline Protestant denominations (known as &quot;Free Churches&quot;), today the most numerous Christian minorities are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) (0.3%), and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (0.2%), also including Orthodox Christianity. Non-Religious since 2000s data were an adjusted by the specified non-religious and most of the non-response per cent. Other religions: Islam in the United Kingdom, British Jews, Hinduism in the United Kingdom, Sikhism in the United Kingdom.

===Censuses===
The statistics for current religion (not religion of upbringing where also asked) from the 2011 census and the corresponding statistics from the 2001 census are set out in the tables below.


===Surveys===
Religious affiliations of UK citizens are recorded by regular surveys, the four major ones being the UK Census, the Labour Force Survey, the British Social Attitudes survey and the European Social Survey. The different questions asked by these surveys produced different results:

*The census for England and Wales asked the question &quot;What is your religion?&quot;. In 2001 14.81% and in 2011 around a quarter (25.1%) of the population said they had &quot;none&quot; and 70% stated they were Christian.
*The census for Scotland asked the question &quot;What religion, religious denomination or body do you belong to?&quot;. In 2001 27.55% and in 2011 36.7% selected &quot;none&quot; and 53.8% stated they were Christian.
*The Labour Force Survey asked the question &quot;What is your religion even if you are not currently practising?&quot; with a response of 15.7% selecting &quot;no religion&quot; in 2004 and 22.4% selecting &quot;no religion&quot; in 2010.
*The British Social Attitudes survey asked the question &quot;Do you regard yourself as belonging to any particular religion?&quot; with 53% selecting &quot;no religion&quot; in 2016.
*The European Social Survey asked the question &quot;Which religion or denomination do you belong to at present?&quot; with 50.54% of respondents selecting &quot;no religion&quot; in 2002 and 52.68% selecting &quot;no religion&quot; in 2008.

Other surveys:

*In 1983, in a large public opinion survey, almost a third of Britons said they believed in Hell and the Devil. In Northern Ireland, 91 per cent of people said they believed in sin. This was reported in &quot;The Observer&quot; on 28 February 1983.
*In 2018, according to a study jointly conducted by London&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s University&#x27;s Benedict XVI Centre for Religion and Society and the Institut Catholique de Paris, and based on data from the European Social Survey 2014–2016 collected on a sample of 560, among 16 to 29 years-old British people 21% were Christians (10% Catholic, 7% Anglican, 2% other Protestant and 2% other Christian), 6% were Muslims, 3% were of other religions, and 70% were not religious. The data was obtained from two questions, one asking &quot;Do you consider yourself as belonging to any particular religion or denomination?&quot; to the full sample and the other one asking &quot;Which one?&quot; to the sample who replied with &quot;Yes&quot;.

The British Social Attitudes surveys and the European Social Surveys are fielded to adult individuals. In contrast, the United Kingdom Census and the Labour Force Surveys are household surveys; the respondent completes the questionnaire on behalf of each member of the household, including children, as well as for themselves. The 2010 Labour Force Survey claimed that 54% of children aged from birth to four years were Christian, rising to 59% for children aged between 5 and 9 and 65% for children aged between 10 and 14. The inclusion of children who are part of religious families influences the results of the polls.

Other major polls agree with the British Social Attitudes surveys and the European Social Surveys, with a YouGov survey fielded in February 2012 indicating that 43% of respondents claimed to belong to a religion and 76% claimed they were not very religious or not religious at all. An Ipsos MORI survey fielded in August 2003 indicated that 18% of respondents claimed to be &quot;a practising member of an organised religion&quot; and 25% claimed &quot;I am a non-practising member of an organised religion&quot;. A 2015 study estimated some 25,000 believers in Christ from a Muslim background, most of whom belong to an evangelical or Pentecostal community.

====Religious affiliation (%) in England, Scotland and Wales according to the Annual Population Survey 2007-2016====

The Annual Population Survey is a combined statistical survey of households in Great Britain which is conducted quarterly by the Office for National Statistics and combines results from the Labour Force Survey and the English, Welsh and Scottish Labour Force Survey, gathers information about the religious affiliation, reported in the table below. The change in the religious affiliation between the 2010 APS and the 2011 APS is due to a question change, which significantly influenced the final results.

===Attendance===

Society in the United Kingdom is markedly more secular than it was in the past and the number of churchgoers fell over the second half of the 20th century. Already in the mid-20th century, church attendance in Britain was relatively low. A Mass-Observation survey conducted in 1948 and 1949 found only 15% of Brittons attended church. The English Church survey found that attendance was 12% in 1979, 10% in 1989, and 7.5% in 1998. The Ipsos MORI poll in 2003 reported that 18% were &quot;a practising member of an organised religion&quot;. The Tearfund Survey in 2007 found that only 7% of the population considered themselves as practising Christians. Sometimes 10% attended church weekly and two-thirds had not gone to church in the past year. The Tearfund Survey also found that two-thirds of UK adults (66%) or 32.2 million people had no connection with the Church at present (nor with another religion). These people were evenly divided between those who have been in the past but have since left (16 million) and those who have never been in their lives (16.2 million).

A survey in 2002 found Christmas attendance at Anglican churches in England varied between 10.19% of the population in the diocese of Hereford, down to just 2.16% in Manchester. Church attendance at Christmas in some dioceses was up to three times the average for the rest of the year. Overall church attendance at Christmas has been steadily increasing in recent years; a 2005 poll found that 43 per cent expected to attend a church service over the Christmas period, in comparison with 39% and 33% for corresponding polls taken in 2003 and 2001 respectively.

A December 2007 report by Christian Research showed that the services of the Catholic Church had become the best-attended services of Christian denominations in England, with average attendance at Sunday Mass of 861,000, compared to 852,000 attending Anglican services. Attendance at Anglican services had declined by 20% between 2000 and 2006, while attendance at Catholic services, boosted by large-scale immigration from Poland and Lithuania, had declined by only 13%. In Scotland, attendance at Church of Scotland services declined by 19% and attendance at Catholic services fell by 25%. British Social Attitudes Surveys have shown the proportion of those in Great Britain who consider they &quot;belong to&quot; Christianity to have fallen from 66% in 1983 to 43% in 2009.

In 2012 about 6% of the population of the United Kingdom regularly attended church, with the average age of attendees being 51; in contrast, in 1980, 11% had regularly attended, with an average age of 37. It is predicted that by 2020 attendance will be around 4%, with an average age of 56. This decline in church attendance has forced many churches to close down across the United Kingdom, with the Church of England alone closing 1,500 churches between 1969 and 2002. Their fates include dereliction, demolition, and residential, artistic and commercial conversion. In October 2014 weekly attendance at Church of England services dropped below 1 million for the first time. At Christmas 2014, 2.4 million attended. For that year baptisms were 130,000, down 12% since 2004; marriages were 50,000, down 19%; and funerals 146,000, down 29%. The Church estimated that about 1% of churchgoers were lost to death each year; the Church&#x27;s age profile suggested that attendances would continue to decline.

One study showed that in 2004 at least 930,000 Muslims attended a mosque at least once a week, just outnumbering the 916,000 regular churchgoers in the Church of England. Muslim sources claim the number of practising Muslims is underestimated as nearly all of them pray at home.

===Belief===
There is a disparity between the figures for those identifying themselves with a particular religion and for those proclaiming a belief in a god:
*In a 2011 YouGov poll, 34% of UK citizens said they believed in a god or gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouGov/Cambridge 2011&quot;&gt;  Retrieved on 7 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*A Eurobarometer opinion poll in 2010 reported that 37% of UK citizens &quot;believed there is a god&quot;, 33% believe there is &quot;some sort of spirit or life force&quot; and 25% answered &quot;I don&#x27;t believe there is any sort of spirit, god or life force&quot;.
*The 2008 European Social Survey suggested that 46.94% of UK citizens never prayed and 18.96% prayed daily.
*A survey in 2007 suggested that 42% of adults resident in the United Kingdom prayed, with one in six praying daily.

===Jedi census phenomenon===

In the 2001 census, 390,127 individuals (0.7 per cent of total respondents) in England and Wales self-identified as followers of the Jedi faith. This Jedi census phenomenon followed an internet campaign that claimed, incorrectly, that the Jedi belief system would receive official government recognition as a religion if it received enough support in the census. An email in support of the campaign, quoted by BBC News, invited people to &quot;do it because you love Star Wars ... or just to annoy people&quot;. The Office for National Statistics revealed the total figure in a press release entitled &quot;390,000 Jedi there are&quot;.

==Christianity==

Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for over 1,400 years. The United Kingdom was formed by the union of previously autonomous states in 1707, and consequently most of the largest religious groups do not have UK-wide organisational structures. While some groups have separate structures for the individual countries of the United Kingdom, others have a single structure covering England and Wales or Great Britain. Similarly, due to the relatively recent creation of Northern Ireland in 1921, most major religious groups in Northern Ireland are organised on an all-Ireland basis.

===Protestantism===
====Anglicanism====


The Church of England is the established church in England. Its most senior bishops sit in the national parliament and the Monarch is its supreme governor. It is also the &quot;mother church&quot; of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The Church of England separated from the Catholic Church in 1534 and became the established church by Parliament in the Act of Supremacy, beginning a series of events known as the English Reformation. Historically it has been the predominant Christian denomination in England and Wales, in terms of both influence and number of adherents.

The Church of Ireland has 219,788 members in Northern Ireland where they make up 11.6% of the population across 418 congregations.

The Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the Anglican Communion (but not a &quot;daughter church&quot; of the Church of England), dates from the final establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1690, when it split from the Church of Scotland. In the 1920s, the Church in Wales became disestablished and independent from the Church of England, but remains in the Anglican Communion.

During the years 2012 to 2014 the number of members of the Church of England dropped by around 1.7 million.

In 2018, 12% of the population of Great Britain identify as Anglicans, a sharp decline from 1983 when 40% of the population identified as Anglicans.

==== Baptists ====


The Baptist Union of Great Britain, despite its name, covers just England and Wales. There is a separate Baptist Union of Scotland. The Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland is an all-Ireland organisation with 16,051 members in Northern Ireland (0.8% of the population) across 94 congregations. Other Baptist associations also exist in England, such as the Grace Baptist association and the Gospel Standard Baptists.

====Charismatics and Pentecostalism====
Assemblies of God in Great Britain are part of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship with over 600 churches in Great Britain. Assemblies of God Ireland cover the whole of the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland. The Apostolic Church commenced in the early part of the 20th century in South Wales and now has over 110 churches across the United Kingdom. Elim Pentecostal Church had over 500 churches across the United Kingdom.

There is also a growing number of independent, charismatic churches that encourage Pentecostal practices as part of their worship. These are broadly grouped together as the British New Church Movement and could number up to 400,000 members. The phenomenon of immigrant churches and congregations that began with the arrival of the HMT &quot;Empire Windrush&quot; from the West Indies in 1948 stands as a unique trend. West Indian congregations that started from this time include the Church of God, New Testament Assembly and New Testament Church of God.

Africans began to arrive in the early 1980s and established their own congregations. Foremost among these are Matthew Ashimolowo from Nigeria and his Kingsway International Christian Centre in London that may be the largest church in Western Europe.

====Methodism====


The Methodist movement traces its origin to John Wesley and the evangelical revival in the 18th century. The British Methodist Church, which has congregations throughout the nation, has around 188,000 members, and 4,110 churches (), though only around 3,000 members in 50 congregations are in Scotland. In the 1960s, the Methodist Church made ecumenical overtures to the Church of England, aimed at church unity. Formally, these failed when they were rejected by the Church of England&#x27;s General Synod in 1972. However, conversations and co-operation continued, leading on 1 November 2003 to the signing of a covenant between the two churches.

The Methodist Church in Ireland covers the whole of the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland where it is the fourth-largest denomination with 133 congregations. The Fellowship of Independent Methodist Churches has 16 churches in Northern Ireland. Combined, these two Methodist denominations have 45,881 members (2.4% of Northern Ireland&#x27;s population)

Other Methodist denominations in Britain include the Salvation Army, founded in 1865; the Free Methodist Church, a holiness church; and the Church of the Nazarene.

====Presbyterianism and Congregationalism====

The Church of Scotland was principally shaped by John Knox, in the Reformation of 1560, when it split from the Catholic Church and established itself as a church in the Reformed tradition. The church is nominally Calvinist with a Presbyterian system of church government. The annual meeting of its general assembly is chaired by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The Church of Scotland celebrates two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, as well as five other rites, such as Confirmation and Matrimony. The church adheres to the Bible and the Westminster Confession of Faith, and is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches.

In Northern Ireland the Presbyterian Church of Ireland is the largest single Protestant denomination with 440 congregations across the region. The Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland has 31 congregations in Northern Ireland, with the first Presbytery being formed in Antrim in 1725. Other smaller denominations include the Reformed Presbyterian Church (34 congregations) and the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster (57 congregations). Combined these presbyterian denominations account for 329,223 persons (17.3% of Northern Ireland&#x27;s population). In addition there are 20 churches in Northern Ireland affiliated with the Congregational Union of Ireland which collectively have 2,656 members.

The Presbyterian Church of Wales seceded from the Church of England in 1811 and formally formed itself into a separate body in 1823.

With its origins in the 16th century, English Presbyterianism, was initially contained with the Church of England until the Great Ejection of 1662. During the 18th century there were few Presbyterian congregations in England until they were revived by Scots who had moved south. In time, this led to the creation of Presbyterian Church of England in 1876. Its successor, the United Reformed Church (URC), a union of Presbyterian and Congregational churches, consists of about 1383 congregations in England, Scotland and Wales. There are about 600 Congregational churches in the United Kingdom. In England there are three main groups, the Congregational Federation, the Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches, and about 100 Congregational churches that are loosely federated with other congregations in the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches, or are unaffiliated. In Scotland the churches are mostly members of the Congregational Federation and in Wales which traditionally has a larger number of Congregationalists, most are members of the Union of Welsh Independents.

====Quakers====

The Britain Yearly Meeting is the umbrella body for the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Great Britain, the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man. It has 14,260 adult members. Northern Ireland comes under the umbrella of the Ireland Yearly Meeting.

===Catholicism===

The Catholic Church has separate national organisations for England, Wales, and Scotland, which means there is no single hierarchy for the Catholic Church in the United Kingdom. There is, however, a single apostolic nuncio to Great Britain, presently Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendía. Catholicism is the second largest denomination in England and Wales, with around five million members, mainly in England. Catholicism is also Scotland&#x27;s second largest Christian denomination, representing a fifth of the population. Catholicism is the largest single denomination of Christianity in Northern Ireland and in the 2021 census, for the first time since the establishment of the state, the Catholic Church attained a plurality (42.3%) of the Northern Irish population. The apostolic nuncio to the whole of Ireland (both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) is Luis Mariano Montemayor. Members of the Eastern Catholic Churches in the United Kingdom are served by their own clergy and do not belong to the Latin Church dioceses but are still in full communion with the Bishop of Rome.

The number of Catholics peaked in the 1960s, but has been on a gradual decline ever since, except in Northern Ireland where currently (2024) there are more Catholics than Protestants. In 2018, 7% of the population identified as Catholics.

===Orthodoxy===
Orthodox Christianity is a relatively minor faith in the United Kingdom when compared to Protestantism and Catholicism; most Orthodox churches cater to immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East and to a lesser extent, East Asia and South East Asia.
It is a relatively minor faith among Britons themselves. In 2013 there were roughly 464,000 members of Orthodox churches in the UK.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
Adherents of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in the United Kingdom are traditionally organised in accordance with patrimonial ecclesiastical jurisdictions.

The Russian Orthodox Church has a Diocese of Sourozh, which covers Great Britain and Ireland, and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia also has a diocese of Great Britain and Western Europe.

The Greek Orthodox Church is represented by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which has established the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, that covers England, Wales, Scotland and the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Ireland that covers Ireland.

The Patriarchate of Antioch has several parishes and missions within the Diocese of the British Isles and Ireland. Other Eastern Orthodox Churches represented in the United Kingdom include the Georgian Orthodox Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Albanian Orthodox Church, and the Arab Orthodox Church.

====Oriental Orthodoxy====
Adherents of Oriental Orthodox Christianity in the United Kingdom are also traditionally organised in accordance with their patrimonial ecclesiastical jurisdictions, each community having its own parishes and priests. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria has two regional Dioceses in the United Kingdom: the Diocese of Ireland, Scotland, North East England, and the Diocese of the Midlands. Other Oriental Orthodox Churches represented in the United Kingdom include the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The homegrown British Orthodox Church and Irish Orthodox Church, although both minor, are also represented.

===Other Trinitarian denominations===
Other denominations and groups include the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Seventh Day Baptists, the Plymouth Brethren, and Newfrontiers.

===Non-Trinitarian denominations===
====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints====

The first missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to proselytise in the British Isles arrived in 1837. By 1900 as many as 100,000 converts had joined the faith, but most of these early members soon emigrated to the United States to join the main body of the church. From the 1950s emigration to the United States began to be discouraged and local congregations grew more rapidly. Today the church claims just over 186,000 members across the United Kingdom, in over 330 local congregations, known as &#x27;wards&#x27; or &#x27;branches&#x27;. The church also maintains two temples in England, the first opening in the London area in 1958, and the second completed in 1998 in Preston and known as the Preston England Temple. Preston is also the site of the first preaching by LDS missionaries in 1837, and is home to the oldest continually existing Latter Day Saint congregation anywhere in the world. Restored 1994–2000, the Gadfield Elm Chapel in Worcestershire is the oldest extant chapel of the LDS Church.

====Other non-Trinitarian denominations====
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses had 137,631 &quot;publishers&quot; (a term referring to members actively involved in preaching) in the United Kingdom in 2015. The Church of Christ, Scientist is also represented in the UK.

The General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches is the umbrella organisation for Unitarian, Free Christian and other liberal religious congregations in the United Kingdom. The Unitarian Christian Association was formed in 1991.

There are an estimated 18,000 Christadelphians in the UK.

==Islam==

Estimates in 2009 suggested a total of about 2.4 million Muslims over all the United Kingdom. Muslims in the United Kingdom tend to live around the major population centers such as Cardiff and London. The vast majority of Muslims in the United Kingdom live in England and Wales: of 1,591,126 Muslims recorded at the 2001 Census, 1,546,626 were living in England and Wales, where they form 3 per cent of the population; 42,557 were living in Scotland, forming 0.8 per cent of the population; and 1,943 were living in Northern Ireland. Between 2001 and 2009 the Muslim population increased roughly 10 times faster than the rest of society.

Most Muslim immigrants to the United Kingdom came from former colonies. The biggest groups of Muslims are of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indian and Arab origins, with the remainder coming from Muslim-dominated areas such as Southwest Asia, Somalia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. During the 18th century, &quot;lascars&quot; (sailors) who worked for the British East India Company settled in port towns with local wives. These numbered only 24,037 in 1891 but 51,616 on the eve of World War I. Naval cooks also came from what is now the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh. From the 1950s onwards, the growing Muslim population has led to a number of notable Mosques being established, including East London Mosque, London Central Mosque, Manchester Central Mosque, London Markaz, Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and Cambridge Central Mosque. According to Kevin Brice, a researcher at the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, thousands convert to Islam annually and there are approximately 100,000 converts to Islam in Britain, where they run two mosques.

According to a Labour Force Survey estimate, the total number of Muslims in Great Britain in 2008 was 2,422,000, around 4 per cent of the total population. Between 2004 and 2008, the Muslim population grew by more than 500,000. In 2010, The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life estimated 2,869,000 Muslims in Great Britain.
The largest age-bracket within the British Muslim population were those under the age of 4, at 301,000 in September 2008. The Muslim Council of Britain and the Islamic Forum of Europe are the umbrellas organisations for many local, regional and specialist Islamic organisations in the United Kingdom, although it is disputed how representative this organisation is of British Muslims as a whole.

==Hinduism==
Hinduism in the United Kingdom resulted from the British rule in India. There are 835,394 Hindus in Great Britain according to the 2011 census constituting 1.32% of the population, although some estimates put this number at nearly 1.5 million. About half of all British Hindus live in London metropolitan area. Small Hindu Communities are also found in Scotland (0.31%) and in Wales (0.34%).

According to United Kingdom&#x27;s Office of National Statistics, of all ethnic minorities in Britain, the British Hindus had the highest rate of economic activity. Hindus are more likely than the general population to have higher education and Hindu men are more likely than the general population to be entrepreneurs. British Hindus also have the third highest poverty level and the lowest rates of arrest, trial or imprisonment. Hindus constitute less than 0.5% of the total Prison population in Britain.

==Sikhism==

There are 524,140 Sikhs in the United Kingdom constituting 0.88% of the population, according to the 2021 Census. While England is home to the majority of Sikhs in the United Kingdom, small communities also exist in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

The first recorded Sikh settler in the United Kingdom was Maharaja Duleep Singh, dethroned and exiled in 1849 at the age of 14, after the Anglo-Sikh wars. During the reign of King Edward VII the first Sikh society in the UK was founded in 1908, it was called The Khalsa Jatha.
The first Sikh Gurdwara was established in 1911, in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Putney, London. The first wave of Sikh migration came in the 1940s, mostly of men from the Punjab seeking work in industries such as foundries and textiles. These new arrivals mostly settled in London, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, the Midlands and West Yorkshire. Thousands of Sikhs from East Africa followed later.

==Judaism==

The first Jewish community in what is now the UK was attested from at least the 1060s, but was expelled in 1290, although non-practising Jews maintained themselves as a small but identifiable group until the 1560s in London. Practising Jews occasionally travelled to England, and individual Jews settled in various parts of the British Isles. In the early 1600s, a small community of Sephardic Jews was identified in Bristol, and ordered to leave in 1609. There have continuously been practising Jews in England since at least the 1630s, but it was not until 1656 that Oliver Cromwell made it known they would not be subject to expulsion. The largely Iberian and German early community grew only steadily from the mid 17th century until the late 19th century, when a large wave of Eastern European immigrants roughly quadrupled the population. Another wave of largely German refugees increased it by a further 50% between 1933 and 1945.

In 1841 Isaac Lyon Goldsmid was made baronet, the first Jew to receive a hereditary title. The first Jewish Lord Mayor of the City of London, Sir David Salomons, was elected in 1855. In 1858, practising Jews were allowed to become serving MPs; on 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild was finally allowed to sit in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom when the law restricting the oath of office to Christians was changed, although Benjamin Disraeli, a baptised, teenage convert to Christianity of Jewish parentage, was already an MP at this time and rose to become Prime Minister in 1874; David Ricardo, another convert to Christianity, had been an MP in the 1810s. In 1884 Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild became the first practising Jewish member of the British House of Lords; again Disraeli was already a member.

British Jews number around 300,000 with the United Kingdom having the fifth largest Jewish community worldwide. However, this figure did not include Jews who identified &#x27;by ethnicity only&#x27; in England and Wales or Scottish Jews who identified as Jewish by upbringing but held no current religion. The largest concentrations of Jews are in London and its environs, Greater Manchester, and Leeds.

==Buddhism==

In the UK census for 2011, there were about 178,000 people who registered their religion as Buddhism. The earliest Buddhist influence on Britain came through its imperial connections with Southeast Asia, and as a result the early connections were with the Theravada traditions of Burma, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. The tradition of study resulted in the foundation of the Pali Text Society, which undertook the task of translating the Pali Canon of Theravāda Buddhist Tradition into English. Buddhism as a path of practise was pioneered by the Theosophists, Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, and in 1880 they became the first Westerners to receive the Three refuges and Five precepts, the formal conversion ceremony by which one traditionally accepted and becomes a Buddhist.

In 1924 London&#x27;s Buddhist Society was founded, and in 1926 the Theravadin London Buddhist Vihara. The rate of growth was slow but steady through the century, and the 1950s saw the development of interest in Zen Buddhism. In 1967 Kagyu Samyé Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre, now the largest Tibetan Buddhist centre in Western Europe, was founded in Scotland. The first home-grown Buddhist movement was also founded in 1967, the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (now the Triratna Buddhist Community). Thai Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah was also established at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in West Sussex in 1979, giving rise to branch monasteries, including Amaravati Buddhist Monastery and Aruna Ratanagiri.There are also other groups like Order of Interbeing and Soka Gakkai in the United Kingdom.

==Other religions==
===Modern paganism===
In the United Kingdom, census figures do not allow an accurate breakdown of traditions within the Pagan heading, as a campaign by the Pagan Federation before the 2001 Census encouraged Wiccans, Heathens, Druids and others all to use the same write-in term &#x27;Pagan&#x27; in order to maximise the numbers reported. For the first time, respondents were able to write in an affiliation not covered by the checklist of common religions, and a total of 42,262 people from England, Scotland and Wales declared themselves to be Pagans by this method. These figures were not immediately analysed by the Office for National Statistics, but were released after an application by the Pagan Federation of Scotland.

In the 2001 Census, a total of 42,262 people from England, Scotland, and Wales declared themselves to be pagans or adherents of Wicca. However, other surveys have led to estimates of around 250,000 or even higher.

According to the 2011 UK Census, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England, and 3,448 in Wales,

====Wicca====
In the 2011 UK Census 11,026 people identified as Wiccans in England and 740 in Wales.

====Druidry====
Modern Druidry grew out of the Celtic revival in 18th century Romanticism. A 2012 Druid analysis estimates that there are roughly 11,000 Druids in Britain.

====Heathenry====

Heathenry consists of a variety of modern movements attempting to revive Germanic paganism, such as that practiced in the British Isles by the Anglo-Saxon and Norse peoples prior to Christianisation. In the 2011 UK Census 2,108 people identified as Heathens. Asatru UK was founded in 2013 and operates as a country-wide group for all inclusive Heathens. As of May 2021, Asatru UK had 2,903 members of its Facebook group. The group currently does not own land and thus is in the process of carving portable god posts that can be used in a vé. The first of these was of the god Woden and was consecrated at a gathering in 2021.

===Jainism===
As of 2011, there are around 20,288 Jains in the United Kingdom. Leicester houses one of the world&#x27;s few Jain temples outside of India. There is an Institute of Jainology at Greenford, London.

One of the first Jain settlers, Champat Rai Jain, was in England during 1892–1897 to study law. He established the Rishabh Jain Lending Library in 1930. Later, he translated several Jain texts into English.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The Baháʼí Faith in the United Kingdom has a historical connection with the earliest phases of the Baháʼí Faith starting in 1845 and has had a major effect on the development of communities of the religion in far flung nations around the world. It is estimated that between 1951 and 1993, Baháʼís from the United Kingdom settled in 138 countries. At the 2011 UK Census, there were 5,021 Baháʼís in just England and Wales. This declined by the 2021 UK Census to 4,725, a diminution of just under 6%.

===Zoroastrianism===
Zoroastrianism in the United Kingdom has a relatively long history. Britain&#x27;s first ethnically South Asian parliamentarian was Zoroastrian and there have been Zoroastrians in the UK for over a century. Many come from the Zoroastrian Parsi community of northwest India, which was under the control of the British Raj until 1948. According to the 2021 UK census, there were 4,105 Zoroastrians in England and Wales, of which 4,043 were in England. The majority (51%) of these (2,050) were in London, most notably the boroughs of Barnet, Harrow and Westminster. The remaining 49% of English Zoroastrians were scattered relatively evenly throughout the country, with the second and third largest concentrations being Birmingham (72) and Manchester (47).

==Religion and society==

===Religion and politics===
Though the main political parties are secular, the formation of the Labour Party was influenced by Christian socialism, Ethical humanism, and by leaders from a nonconformist backgrounds, such as Keir Hardie. Labour&#x27;s early development was also markedly influenced by non-religious philosophies such as humanism through Ethical movement, which gave rise to the Fabian Society and incubated prominent Labour people such as its first Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald (who even previously served as President of Humanists UK). Most Labour leaders have been atheists and agnostics (exceptions include Smith, Blair, Brown, and Corbyn). On the other hand, the Church of England was once nicknamed &quot;the Conservative Party at prayer&quot;, though this has changed since the 1980s as the Church has moved to the left of the Conservative Party on social and economic issues.

Some minor parties are explicitly &#x27;religious&#x27; in ideology: two &#x27;Christian&#x27; parties – the Christian Party and the Christian Peoples Alliance, fielded joint candidates at the 2009 European Parliament elections and increased their share of the vote to come eighth, with 249,493 votes (1.6% of total votes cast), and in London, where the CPA had three councillors, the Christian parties picked up 51,336 votes (2.9% of the vote), up slightly from the 45,038 gained in 2004.

The Church of England is represented in the UK Parliament by 26 bishops (the Lords Spiritual) and the British monarch is a member of the church (required under Article 2 of the Treaty of Union) as well as its supreme governor. The Lords Spiritual have seats in the House of Lords and debate government policies affecting the whole of the United Kingdom. The Church of England also has the right to draft legislative measures (related to religious administration) through the General Synod that can then be passed into law by Parliament. The Prime Minister, regardless of personal beliefs, plays a key role in the appointment of Church of England bishops, although in July 2007 Gordon Brown proposed reforms of the Prime Minister&#x27;s ability to affect Church of England appointments.

===Religion and education===
Religious education and Collective Worship are compulsory in many state schools in England and Wales by virtue of clauses 69 and 70 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Clause 71 of the act gives parents the right to withdraw their children from Religious Education and Collective Worship and parents should be informed of their right in accordance with guidelines published by the Department for Education; &quot;a school should ensure parents or carers are informed of this right&quot;. The content of the religious education is decided locally by the Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education.

In England and Wales, a significant number of state funded schools are faith schools with the vast majority Christian (mainly either of Church of England or Catholic) though there are also Jewish, Muslim and Sikh faith schools. Faith schools follow the same national curriculum as state schools, though with the added ethos of the host religion. Until 1944 there was no requirement for state schools to provide religious education or worship, although most did so. The Education Act 1944 introduced a requirement for a daily act of collective worship and for religious education but did not define what was allowable under these terms. The act contained provisions to allow parents to withdraw their children from these activities and for teachers to refuse to participate. The Education Reform Act 1988 introduced a further requirement that the majority of collective worship be &quot;wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character&quot;. According to a 2003 report from the Office for Standards in Education, a &quot;third of governing bodies do not fulfil their statutory duties adequately, sometimes because of a failure to pursue thoroughly enough such matters as arranging a daily act of collective worship&quot;.

In Scotland, the majority of schools are non-denominational, but separate Catholic schools, with an element of control by the Catholic Church, are provided within the state system. The Education (Scotland) Act 1980 imposes a statutory duty on all local authorities to provide religious education and religious observance in Scottish schools. These are currently defined by the Scottish Government&#x27;s Curriculum for Excellence (2005).

===Religion and prison===
Prisoners are given religious freedom and privileges while serving their sentences. This includes access to a chaplain or religious advisor, authorised religious reading materials, ability to change faith, as well as other privileges. Several faith-based outreach programmes provide faith promoting guidance and counselling.

Every three months, the Ministry of Justice collects data, including religious affiliation, of all UK prisoners and is published as the Offender Management Caseload Statistics. This data is then compiled into reports and published in the House of Commons library.

On 31 March 2015 the prison population of England and Wales was recorded as 49% Christian, 14% Muslim, 2% Buddhist, 2% other religions and 31% no religion. In this statistics, Muslims happen to be the most disproportionately represented religious group facing arrest, trial and imprisonment, with 13.1% of prisoners being Muslims while the community represents 4% of those aged 15 years or older within the general population. The Prison Officers&#x27; Association has put that down to thousands of prisoners becoming so-called &quot;convenience Muslims&quot; – converting to the religion to deliberately play the system. [ ...] It added they were also being made even more vulnerable to radicalisation.&quot;

===Religion and the media===
The Communications Act 2003 requires certain broadcasters in the United Kingdom to carry a &quot;suitable quantity and range of programmes&quot; dealing with religion and other beliefs, as part of their public service broadcasting. Prominent examples of religious programming include the BBC television programme &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;, aired on a Sunday evening with an average weekly audience of 2.5 million, and the &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; slot on BBC Radio 4. Channels also offer documentaries on, or from the perspective of a criticism of organised religion. A significant example is Richard Dawkins&#x27; two-part Channel 4 documentary, &quot;The Root of all Evil?&quot;. Open disbelief of, or even mockery of organised religion, is not regarded as a taboo in the British media, though it has occasionally provoked controversy – for example, the movie &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, the poem &quot;The Love That Dares to Speak Its Name&quot;, and the musical &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, all of which involved characters based on Jesus, were subject to public outcry and blasphemy allegations, while &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, a novel by British Indian author Salman Rushdie which includes a fantasy sequence about Muhammed, caused global protests including several by British Muslims.

=== Religion and social identity: patron saints of the home nations ===
*Saint George is the patron saint of England.
*Saint Andrew is the patron saint of Scotland.
*Saint David is the patron saint of Wales.
*Saint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland.

===Interfaith dialogue, tolerance, religious discrimination and secularism===
====Interfaith dialogue====
The Interfaith Network for the United Kingdom encompasses the main faith organisations of the United Kingdom, either directly with denominational important representatives or through joint bodies for these denominations, promotes local interfaith cooperation, promotes understanding between faiths and convenes meetings and conferences where social and religious questions of concern to the different faith communities can be examined together, including meetings of the Network&#x27;s &#x27;Faith Communities Consultative Forum&#x27;.

Ecumenical friendship and cooperation has gradually developed between Christian denominations and where inter-sect prejudice exists this has via education and employment policy been made a pressing public matter in dealing with its two prominent examples – sectarianism in Glasgow and Northern Ireland – where segregation is declining.

====Tolerance and Religious Discrimination====

In the early 21st century, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 made it an offence in England and Wales to incite hatred against a person on the grounds of their religion. The common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel were abolished with the coming into effect of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 on 8 July 2008.

2005–2010 polls have shown that public opinion in the United Kingdom generally tends towards a suspicion or outright disapproval of radical or evangelical religiosity, though moderate groups and individuals are rarely subject to less favourable treatment from society or employers.

The Equality Act 2010 prohibits discrimination against people on the basis of religion, in the supply of goods and services and selection for employment, subject to very limited exceptions (such as the right of schools and religious institutions to appoint paid ministers).

====Secularism====

There is no strict separation of church and state in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, most public officials may display the most common identifiers of a major religion in the course of their duties – for example, rosary beads. Chaplains are provided in the armed forces (see Royal Army Chaplains&#x27; Department, RAF Chaplains Branch) and in prisons.

Although school uniform codes are generally drawn up flexibly enough to accommodate compulsory items of religious dress, some schools have banned wearing the crucifix in a necklace, arguing that to do so is not a requirement of Christianity where they prohibit all other necklaces. Post-adolescence, the wearing of a necklace is permitted in some F.E. colleges who permit religious insignia necklaces on a wider basis, which are without exception permitted at universities.

Some churches have warned that the Equality Act 2010 could force them to go against their faith when hiring staff.

In 2011, judges ruled that the European Convention on Human Rights required bed-and-breakfast owners to rent rooms to same-sex couples.

In 2011, Clive Bone sued Bideford Town Council for opening meetings with prayer. The High Court ruled in Bone&#x27;s favor but, soon afterward, the government passed new laws permitting prayer at town meetings.

In 2011, two judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales upheld previous statements in the country&#x27;s jurisprudence that the (non-canon) laws of the United Kingdom &#x27;do not include Christianity&#x27;. Therefore, a local authority was acting lawfully in denying a Christian married couple the right to foster care because of stated negative views on homosexuality. In terms of the rights recognised &quot;in the case of fostering arrangements at least, the right of homosexuals to equality [pursuant to the Equality Act 2010] should take precedence over the right of Christians to manifest their beliefs and moral values&quot;.

==National and regional differences==
Levels of affiliation vary between different part of the UK, particularly between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The percentages declaring themselves Christians in the 2011 Census are 59.4 in England, 57.6 in Wales and 53.8 in Scotland, which decreased by 12.3, 14.3, and 11.3 percentage points respectively from the census of 2001. Northern Ireland remains one of the most religious nations in western Europe with 82.3% of the population claiming Christian affiliation, with a decline of only 3.5% by the 2011 census, while &quot;other religions&quot; have increased in membership. Religion has been seen as both a product and a cause of political divisions in Northern Ireland.

<text>The Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey, or &quot;TrES&quot;, used three 4-inch (10 cm) telescopes located at Lowell Observatory, Palomar Observatory, and Teide Observatory to locate exoplanets. It was made using the network of small, relatively inexpensive telescopes designed to look specifically for planets orbiting bright stars using the transit method. The array used 4-inch Schmidt telescopes having CCD cameras and automated search routines. The survey was created by David Charbonneau of the Center for Astrophysics, Timothy Brown of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Edward Dunham of Lowell Observatory.

The TrES survey is no longer operational.

==Discoveries==
The TrES project discovered a total of five planets in its years of operation. All were discovered using the transit method. Note that the discovery papers do not use the &quot;b&quot; suffix typically used in extrasolar planet designations. While forms with and without the b are used in the literature, the table here uses the designations assigned by the discoverers.

<doc id="1135598" wikidata="Q640953" url="?curid=1135598" title="Billy Sherwood">
<text>William Wyman Sherwood (born March 14, 1965) is an American multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, singer, record producer and mixing engineer. He is best known for his tenures in the English progressive rock band Yes as guitarist and keyboardist in 1994 and from 1997 to 2000 and as bassist since 2015, following the death of original bassist Chris Squire. He is also known for working with former and current Yes members on other projects.

In addition to his involvement with Yes, Sherwood is the frontman of progressive rock groups World Trade, Circa and formerly Lodgic. In 2017, he joined Asia after the death of original singer and bassist John Wetton. Outside of these bands, Sherwood has worked as a producer since the 1990s, most notably on tribute albums dedicated to Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Queen and many others. He is also a solo artist, having released ten studio albums to date.

==Early life==
Sherwood was born on March 14, 1965, in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was born into a musical family; his father Bobby Sherwood was an actor, musician, and big band leader and his mother Phyllis is a former singer and drummer. His brother Michael was a singer and keyboardist. Sherwood&#x27;s godfather was comedian Milton Berle.

==Career==
===Lodgic and World Trade===
Sherwood&#x27;s music career started when he joined a band called Lodgic formed by his brother Michael. Billy played bass and sang, while Michael played keyboards and sang back up. Lodgic also included Guy Allison on keyboards, Jimmy Haun on guitar and Gary Starns on drums. They eventually moved the band to Los Angeles in 1980. After many years of trying to get things together, they recorded their debut album &quot;Nomadic Sands&quot;, released in 1985.

After Lodgic broke up, Sherwood put together a new band with Guy Allison. They recruited guitarist Bruce Gowdy and drummer Mark T. Williams to form World Trade. They recorded their self-titled debut in 1989, with Sherwood taking on the roles of engineer, mixer, and producer again, along with his band duties as bassist and lead singer. Sherwood got back together with his bandmates from World Trade and released &quot;Euphoria&quot; in 1995, with Jay Schellen replacing Williams on drums.

In 2017, Sherwood reunited with World Trade to record a third album titled &quot;Unify&quot;, which was released on August 4, 2017.

===Yes===

By 1989, Sherwood was invited to meet Yes bassist Chris Squire after singer and record executive Derek Shulman suggested his name. By this time, Yes had suffered a setback when singer Jon Anderson had left and formed Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH). Sherwood was invited to jam with the remaining Yes members, Squire, guitarist Trevor Rabin, drummer Alan White, and keyboardist Tony Kaye, with the intention of Sherwood on lead vocals. By the time the five had recorded some demos, they merged with members of ABWH in 1990 to become an eight-man formation of Yes, which lasted until 1992. The two groups recorded songs for &quot;Union&quot; (1991), which features the first song that Sherwood and Squire wrote together, &quot;The More We Live - Let Go&quot;. Sherwood struck up a friendship with Squire that would lead him to work with him throughout the next 20 years.

In 1994, Sherwood toured with Yes as additional guitarist and keyboardist on their tour supporting &quot;Talk&quot; (1994). Sherwood would co-produce, engineer and mix the new studio tracks for their studio albums &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; (1996) and &quot;Keys to Ascension 2&quot; (1997). Following Rick Wakeman&#x27;s departure in 1997 Sherwood and Squire continued to write songs, which Yes decided to record for their next studio album, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; (1997). This made Sherwood become a full-time member of the group, playing rhythm guitar and keyboards. The addition of Igor Khoroshev in 1997 left Sherwood to handle backing guitar and vocals for live shows. In 2000, after recording and touring their next album, &quot;The Ladder&quot; (1999), Sherwood left the group. A live album and DVD of the show at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, Sherwood&#x27;s hometown, was released as &quot;House of Yes: Live from House of Blues&quot;.

On May 19, 2015, it was announced that Squire would be undergoing treatment for acute erythroid leukemia, and that Yes would continue their 2015 North American tour with Sherwood filling Squire&#x27;s role. After Squire&#x27;s death on June 27, 2015, Sherwood (along with other former and current members of Yes) made a public statement expressing his grief. In regards to his new role as the now-permanent bassist for Yes: &quot;Chris said to me, &#x27;play the music, be yourself and make me proud&#x27;. It&#x27;s my true desire now [to] live up to his wishes.&quot; His first studio album with Yes after returning to the band was &quot;The Quest&quot; (2021).

===Conspiracy===
After his departure from Yes, Sherwood worked with Squire to release the album &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, which includes some work they composed together some years before.

In 2003, Sherwood released &quot;The Unknown&quot;, another album with Squire as Conspiracy.

More recently, Sherwood has been working on further tribute albums, notably &quot;Back Against the Wall&quot; and &quot;Return to the Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, tributes to Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; respectively. The latter includes a new track recorded with Tony Kaye.

===Circa and Yoso===
In 2007, a new band with Sherwood, Alan White, Tony Kaye and Jimmy Haun was announced, called Circa. With the release of their debut album &quot;Circa 2007&quot; and a live DVD concert, Circa has played various live dates. White left the band and was replaced by Jay Schellen.

On January 14, 2009, Circa self-released on the Internet its second studio album, &quot;Circa HQ&quot;. This time, White was not available due to his commitments with Yes (who had begun a new tour). Sherwood&#x27;s long time friend, collaborator and drummer, Jay Schellen, replaced White on the album. After a short international tour, Sherwood and co. started another project with former Toto singer, Bobby Kimball. Kimball, Sherwood, Tony Kaye and Jimmy Haun formed new band, Yoso, with a debut studio album in April 2009. Haun later abandoned the line-up (in order to focus on his work for adverts). He was replaced by Yes tribute band guitarist, Johnny Bruhns. Schellen chose to focus on his work in Asia Featuring John Payne and, after a number of other drummers, the band toured with Scott Connor on drums. Yoso then disbanded.

In 2011, Circa returned with a new line-up of Sherwood, Kaye, Bruhns and Connor, while Sherwood released his fifth solo album, &quot;What was the Question?&quot;. In 2012, Sherwood wrote, produced, arranged and performed on &quot;The Prog Collective&quot;, an album featuring vocal or instrumental contributions from many of the progressive rock artists he had worked with over the years. He reprised the concept with a similar collection of artists for &quot;Epilogue&quot;, released in 2013.

On October 8, 2013, they released the official video to William Shatner&#x27;s record &quot;Ponder The Mystery&quot;, followed by a sold-out tour with Circa. &quot;Ponder The Mystery&quot; also features appearances of Steve Vai, Robby Krieger, Al Di Meola, George Duke, Vince Gill, Dave Koz, Rick Wakeman and Edgar Winter.

On July 8, 2016, Sherwood re-grouped with Circa to release their fourth album titled &quot;Valley Of The Windmill&quot;.

===Other projects===

During the hiatus of Yes, Squire put together the Chris Squire Experiment, having Sherwood as co-lead singer while playing some guitar and keyboards. Sherwood then went on to record a project called The Key with guitarist Marty Walsh, though they would not release the album until 1997.

Behind the board, Sherwood worked with Motörhead, Dangerous Toys, and Paul Rodgers (formerly of Free and Bad Company) as producer and engineer. Sherwood also guested on Toto&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; album, singing and playing bass. He also produced a couple of tribute albums, including &quot;Jeffology&quot;, a tribute to Jeff Beck. Sherwood then joined Yes on tour as an additional musician, playing guitar and keyboards for their tour in support of &quot;Talk&quot;.

Sherwood appeared along with William Shatner in the Season 14 premiere of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; where they met blue team as part of their reward for winning the signature dish challenge.

Sherwood is also credited for writing the theme song for the online anime series, &quot;Kung Fu Jimmy Chow&quot;.

Sherwood worked as producer, mixer and engineer, including on more tribute albums: &quot;Dragon Attack&quot;, a tribute to Queen; &quot;Salute to AC/DC&quot;; and &quot;Crossfire&quot;, a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan.

On 11 January 2017, Asia announced that Sherwood would be filling in on bass and lead vocals for John Wetton for tour dates in the spring of 2017 while Wetton underwent chemotherapy, having been chosen by Wetton himself. Wetton died on 31 January 2017 and the tour went forward with Sherwood. In 2019, Asia&#x27;s line-up changed with Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal joining on guitar and lead vocals and Sherwood remaining on just bass and backing vocals.

In May 2019, Sherwood and his partner Elisa Furr, along with Jay Schellen, Guy Allison and John Thomas (who has worked with Vixen) formed a new band together featuring Furr on vocals.

In July 2020, fellow Yes member Jon Davison announced a new side project with himself, Sherwood and Schellen called Arc of Life. He also said they had completed an album that would be released late 2020 or early 2021. In early 2021, Dave Kerzner revealed the rest of the band as himself and Jimmy Haun. The album was released on February 12, 2021.

===Solo career===
In 1999, Sherwood composed his first solo album called &quot;The Big Peace&quot; in which he played most of the instruments and also produced. The album was intended to be a back-to-basics of his progressive roots.

In August 2008, Sherwood released his third solo album, &quot;At the Speed of Life&quot;, for which he received an award as the best Progressive Rock Producer.

On May 20, 2019, it was announced that Sherwood was working on his tenth solo album, titled &quot;Citizen: In The Next Life&quot;, which was released on July 12, 2019.

==Equipment==
Sherwood mainly plays Carvin guitars, 6- and 12-string; his main guitar, which he&#x27;s played since his first stint in Yes, is a red Carvin, Telecaster-shaped, with a Roland V-guitar pickup. His acoustic guitars are made by Babicz. He uses Line 6 amplifiers with 4x12&quot; cabinets.

As a bassist, Sherwood was known for years for playing Spector basses through Tech-21 amps with 2-4X12&quot; cabinets.
In 2022, he was seen playing Ibanez basses in addition to his Spector instruments, and indicated by 2023 that he had completely switched over. He has also played Kubicki, Tobias, Fender and Turner basses in the past.

<text>Luc-Olivier Merson (21 May 1846 - 13 November 1920) was a French academic painter and illustrator. He was also known for his postage stamp and currency designs.
==Biography==
Born Nicolas Luc-Olivier Merson in Paris, France]], he grew up in an artistic household, the son of Charles-Olivier Merson, a painter and art critic. He studied under Gustave Chassevent at the École de Dessin and then Isidore Pils at the . Merson had his first work exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1866 and three years later was awarded the Prix de Rome. During the five years spent working in Italy, he concentrated on religious and historical subjects for his art.

Back in France, in 1875 he won the first-prize medal at the exhibition by the Société des artistes français. &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, one of Merson&#x27;s best-known paintings, was created in 1881 as a result of the huge popularity of the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. With its mystical Gothic imagery, its style reflects the influence of the then evolving Symbolist movement.

Merson did major decorative commissions for such institutions as the Palais de Justice, the Louis Pasteur Museum, and the mosaic in the chancel vault in the Basilica of the Sacré Cœur. He also did the artwork for stained-glass windows, an example of which can be found in the Church of the Holy Trinity Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His profile was raised considerably after being awarded a gold medal for his painting at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, and in 1892 he was elected to the Académie des beaux-arts.

Merson was one of the first artists to buy photographs from Eugène Atget.

By 1900 Merson was designing postage stamps for the French post and the Monaco post.
He was teaching at the Académie Vitti in 1903.
By 1908 he had been contracted by the Bank of France to create a number of designs for some of the country&#x27;s banknotes. Between 1906 and 1911 he taught at the École des Beaux-Arts, with students such as Clément Serveau, who would also eventually design stamps and banknotes himself. In recognition of his contribution to French culture, Merson was awarded the Legion of Honor. Also during this period, it is reported that Merson had under his tutelage the French painter Henri Alphonse Barnoin.

Merson died in Paris in 1920, his work largely forgotten as a result of the overwhelming popularity of the avant-garde art forms as seen in the works of the Impressionists and other artistic movements. Named as a Knight of the Legion of Honor during his life, he was elevated to the level of Commander posthumously.

Among Merson&#x27;s pupils were the American painter Claire Shuttleworth and the Swiss printmaker Martha Cunz.

<text>Ian John McKay, VC (7 May 1953 – 12 June 1982) was a British Army soldier and a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Wortley, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, McKay was the eldest of the three sons of Kenneth John McKay, a steel worker, and Freda Doreen Hargreaves. He was educated at Rotherham Grammar School.

McKay left school at seventeen and in August 1970 enlisted in the Army, training as a paratrooper. Posted to the 1st Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (1 Para) in early 1971, he served in Northern Ireland, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

On 30 January 1972, McKay was part of a patrol on the streets of Derry involved in the killing of unarmed civilians known as Bloody Sunday. In official reports concerning the massacre he is referred to as Soldier T. An inquiry concluded that McKay was likely responsible for firing the shot which wounded Patrick Brolly. However, the inquiry determined that he was the only soldier present who had not fired indiscriminately, had a valid reason to fire, and had not intended to shoot Brolly. The inquiry found that if he did fire the shots which wounded Brolly, he unintentionally hit him while aiming at another man who was throwing bottles containing acid at him.

By April 1982 he was platoon sergeant of 4 Platoon, B Company, 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, and deployed with his unit for service in the Falklands War. He was killed during the Battle of Mount Longdon, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Citation==
After initial burial in the Falklands, McKay was later brought home, and on 26 November 1982 he was re-buried with full military honours at Aldershot Military Cemetery.

==The medal==
McKay&#x27;s medals were sold by his wife around the year 1989, and his VC is now on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Legacy==
The Territorial Army centre in Sgt McKay&#x27;s home town of Rotherham is named &quot;McKay VC Barracks&quot;, also an accommodation block at the Defence Academy at Shrivenham was named McKay House in his honour.

In mid October 2011, the Sergeants and Warrant Officers bar at MPA, Falkland Islands, was renamed as &quot;Ian McKay VC Bar&quot; in his honour.

The McKay VC Gymnasium is a gym facility and sports hall located across the football fields at Vimy Barracks, Catterick Garrison. A facility that oversees the training of recruits from The Parachute Regiment and other Units.

McKay was profiled in the 2006 television docudrama &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot;, which included archive footage, dramatisations of his actions and an interview with his mother.

The Bloody Sunday Inquiry found that, of the soldiers who fired upon civilians, Private T (McKay) was the only one to do so with plausible cause if he was responsible for shooting Patrick Brolly and injuring him.

<doc id="1135616" wikidata="Q5524340" url="?curid=1135616" title="Garth Drabinsky">
<text>Garth Drabinsky (born 1949) is a Canadian film and theatrical producer and entrepreneur. In 2009, he was convicted and sentenced to prison for fraud and forgery. The sentence was reduced from 7 to 5 years in prison, on appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear a subsequent appeal. In April 2023, a judge dismissed Drabinsky’s defamation lawsuit against American Actor’s Equity for placing him on their ‘Do Not Work’ list, and in July 2024 the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this dismissal, along with his claim that the union&#x27;s conduct violated antitrust law. Drabinsky has attempted 3 comebacks all resulting in failure and millions of investor dollars being lost.

==Early life==
Drabinsky contracted polio at age 3 and had multiple operations until he was 12. Born to a Jewish family in Toronto, Ontario, Drabinsky graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1973, and was called to the bar in Ontario in 1975.

Drabinsky wrote a textbook, &quot;Motion Pictures and the Arts in Canada: The Business and the Law&quot;, while attending law school.

==Film and theatrical career==
===Film===
Entering into the entertainment business in 1978 as an independent commercial film producer (through Tiberius Entertainment Limited, formed with Joel Michaels) and film distributor (through Pan-Canadian Film Distributors Inc., formed with Nat Taylor), Drabinsky produced a series of projects in the 1970s and 1980s. He produced &quot;A Broadway Musical&quot;, &quot;The Disappearance&quot;, &quot;The Silent Partner&quot;, &quot;The Changeling&quot;, &quot;Tribute&quot;, &quot;The Amateur&quot;, &quot;Losin&#x27; It&quot;. However, he stopped producing films due to financial problems at Cineplex.

In April 1979, he and Nat Taylor co-founded Cineplex Theatres, which created a chain of multiplex theatres for the Canadian market. By May 1984, it had acquired the Canadian Odeon Theatre chain, thus becoming Cineplex Odeon and a major player in the industry. It expanded further through the acquisition of several US theatre chains, but he left the company in December 1989.

Other films:
:* &quot;The Gospel of John&quot; (2003)
:* &quot;Half Light&quot; (2004)
:* &quot;Barrymore&quot; (2011)

===Theatre===
He leveraged his ownership of the Pantages Theatre in Toronto to form the publicly traded theatre production company, Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada, Inc., also known as Livent. The company expanded, building or refurbishing several theatres, including the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, and entered into management deals with others in Toronto, Vancouver, and New York. It became noted for its productions (which earned a total of 20 Tony Awards out of a total of 71 nominations) of:

:* &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1989 Canadian production)
:* &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; (1992 Canadian production)
:* &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot; (1992 Canadian production)*
:* &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1993 Canadian production)**
:* &quot;Ragtime&quot;, (1996 original production)
:* &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1995 Canadian production)
:* &quot;Fosse&quot; (1999 Broadway production)*
:* &quot;Paradise Square&quot; (2022 Broadway production)

===After Livent===
Beginning in 2002, Drabinsky dabbled for a few years with the Toronto-based film production and direct marketing company, Visual Bible International Inc. (OTCBB: VBII). Although he and Livent co-founder Myron Gottlieb were both purported to be creative consultants to the company, they were instrumental in building VBII&#x27;s business model and trying to find an American executive to serve as president and CEO to serve as a mouthpiece to Wall Street. They were indeed running the company behind the scenes as fugitives from American prosecutors. One executive who was recruited by the executive search firm Korn Ferry and offered the position, Stuart Hotchkiss, a former Time Inc. executive, declined the job after learning about Drabinsky&#x27;s and Gottlieb&#x27;s legal woes and being told by then company chairman and Toronto dentist, Dr. Steven Small, that he would not be able to fire either consultant should the need arise. VBII was put into receivership by an Ontario court in 2005.

Drabinsky remained in the Canadian entertainment industry through Tiberius Entertainment (which later was known as Garth H. Drabinsky Productions). In 2011, it promoted the film &quot;Barrymore&quot; at the Toronto International Film Festival, based on the play with Christopher Plummer. Drabinsky then partnered with former CBC executive Richard Stursberg to raise funds for two musicals.

In 2022, Drabinsky was the lead producer for the Broadway musical &quot;Paradise Square&quot;. It began previews at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in New York City on March 15, 2022, and opened on April 3, 2022 receiving mixed reviews, and earning Drabinsky a Tony Award nomination for Best Musical. On July 11, 2022, it was announced the musical would close on July 17 due to low ticket sales. After several cast members and stage managers spoke out against the working conditions and unpaid benefits, Actors&#x27; Equity announced plans to put Drabinsky on the &quot;Do Not Work&quot; list, effectively banning him from producing any future Broadway shows.

==Livent insolvency and subsequent proceedings==
In November 1998, Livent sought bankruptcy protection in the US and Canada, claiming a debt of $334 million, and securities regulators in both Canada and the US began investigating Livent&#x27;s books.

===Canadian proceedings===
On March 25, 2009, Drabinsky and Livent co-founder Myron Gottlieb were found guilty of fraud and forgery in Ontario Superior Court for misstating the company&#x27;s financial statements between 1993 and 1998. Drabinsky was sentenced to seven years in jail on August 5, 2009, for his role in the case.

Drabinsky filed an appeal in the Ontario Court of Appeal with respect to his sentence on September 3, 2009. During that appeal, he remained free on bail. On September 13, 2011, the Court of Appeal, while upholding the convictions, reduced Drabinsky&#x27;s sentence to 5 years. Drabinsky applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the application was dismissed without costs on March 29, 2012. Drabinsky was originally held at Millhaven Institution, for assessment. In December 2011, he was transferred to serve out his sentence at Beaver Creek Institution, a minimum security prison, located in Gravenhurst, Ontario, and was released on day parole in February 2013. Drabinsky was granted full parole on January 20, 2014.

Administrative proceedings were initiated against Livent, Drabinsky and others by the Ontario Securities Commission in 2001, and they were suspended in 2002 until all outstanding criminal proceedings had been completed. In February 2013, the OSC announced that hearings would take place on March 19, 2013, in the matter. Myron Gottlieb and Gordon Eckstein, who were the other parties in the proceedings, subsequently entered into settlement agreements with the OSC in September 2014 and May 2015 respectively.

In 2017, the Ontario Securities Commission permanently banned Drabinsky from becoming a director or officer of any public company in Ontario. The OSC also prohibited him from acting as an investment promoter, and banned him from trading securities (other than as a retail investor, for trades within his RRSP or through a registered dealer for accounts in his name only).

===US proceedings===
In January 1999, Livent reached an administrative settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, while civil and criminal proceedings were simultaneously pursued against Drabinsky, Gottlieb and certain other former Livent employees.

In 2005, former investors in Livent corporate bonds won a $23.3 million judgment against Drabinsky and Gottlieb in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for which enforcement of the judgment was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 2008.

On June 25, 2019, legal authorities in New York dismissed all outstanding criminal charges against Drabinsky (almost 20 years after accusing him of fraud involving Livent Inc.) with prejudice. Assistant United States attorney, Sarah Eddy, said the dismissal is appropriate because Mr. Drabinsky had already been prosecuted in Canada for the fraud. While the outstanding charges had been dormant for many years, they impeded Mr. Drabinsky from being able to travel to the United States, for fear of extradition. Drabinsky is now free to travel to-and-from the United States, and has been doing so frequently while working on his new musical, &quot;Paradise Square&quot; (formerly titled, &quot;Hard Times&quot;).

===Disbarment===
On July 17, 2014, Drabinsky was disbarred by the Tribunal of the Law Society of Upper Canada for unbecoming conduct, having been found guilty of defrauding the public and forging certain financial statements. The Tribunal&#x27;s order, effective immediately, revoked his licence to practice law in the province of Ontario.

===Order of Canada===
On November 29, 2012, Governor General David Johnston signed an Ordinance of Termination revoking Drabinsky&#x27;s membership in the Order of Canada, originally conferred in 1995 in the Officer grade. Drabinsky subsequently filed an application in the Federal Court of Canada to block his removal, which was dismissed on January 9, 2014. He subsequently appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. The appeal was heard in December 2014, and rejected the following month, when the court held that there was &quot;no basis&quot; for it to intervene in the matter.

<doc id="1135617" wikidata="Q4747928" url="?curid=1135617" title="Amos Noë Freeman">
<text>Amos Noë Freeman (1809 —1893) was an African-American abolitionist, Presbyterian minister, and educator. He was the first full-time minister of Abyssinian Congregational Church in Portland, Maine, where he led a station on the Underground Railroad.

==Early life and education==
Amos Noë Freeman was born in Rahway, New Jersey. He was orphaned and raised within the church from an early age. As a child, he was sent to attend the African Free School in Manhattan, then matriculated to Phoenix High School in New York City, established by his mentor Rev. Theodore Sedgewick Wright.

Freeman returned to his native New Jersey to attend Rahway Academy, and later transferred to the Oneida Institute in Whitesboro, New York. It had recently been founded by radical Presbyterian minister, Rev. Beriah Green. Freeman was one of four African Americans in the first year class of 33; others were Amos Beman, who became a good friend; Alexander Crummell, and Henry Highland Garnet. Upon graduating from Oneida Institute in the early 1830s, Freeman moved back to New Jersey, first to New Brunswick, then Newark, to teach in the &quot;colored&quot; public schools.

==Marriage and family==
In 1839 in Newark, Freeman married Christiana Taylor Williams (1812–1903), born in Red Hook on Hudson, New York. She was a recently manumitted domestic slave and black descendant of Philip H. Livingston (1769, Jamaica-1831, New York), grandson of Philip Livingston, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; and Barbara Williams, an enslaved woman of African descent born in Jamaica. Christiana Williams had worked in one or more of Livingston&#x27;s households in New York state.

The Freemans had a family, including a daughter, Mary Freeman. She married Rev. Robert Foster Wheeler. One of their daughters, Laura Wheeler Waring, became a portrait painter known for her work during the Harlem Renaissance. She was among the first African-American artists to have works exhibited by the Harmon Foundation, and was commissioned by them to do portraits of prominent African Americans.

==Ministry==
Freeman was ordained as a minister by the New York Presbytery in 1840. In 1841, he and his wife moved to Portland, Maine, where he was installed as the first pastor of the Abyssinian Congregational Church, now the third oldest surviving black church in the United States. It became a center of the anti-slavery movement and part of the Underground Railroad. Freeman became the most well-known African American in Maine because of his leadership there; he was a strong supporter of education and also ran a school affiliated with the church. For a decade, he and his wife provided support to fugitive slaves at the church and in their home.

In 1852, Rev. Freeman became the pastor of Siloam Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York, founded in 1849. He served there from 1852 to 1860. He was a longtime friend of Amos Gerry Beman, a prominent black minister active in the Northeast. In 1853, he was a prominent attendee of the radical abolitionist National African American Convention in Rochester, New York. His was one of 5 names attached to the address of the convention to the people of the United States published under the title, &quot;The Claims of Our Common Cause&quot;, along with Frederick Douglass, James Monroe Whitfield, Henry O. Wagoner, and George Boyer Vashon. In 1857 Freeman moderated the annual meeting of the Evangelical Association of Colored Ministers of Congregational and Presbyterian Churches, which met from 1856 to 1859 to confirm their distinctive vocation; that year they met at the Central Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia. In 1859 Freeman hosted this meeting at the Siloam Church, by which time there were 27 black churches in the group.

While Rev. Freeman lived in Brooklyn in the mid-1850s, he secretly sheltered and aided Anna Maria Weems, a young fugitive slave, on her journey to freedom in Canada. Jacob Bigelow, a Washington, DC lawyer, disguised her as a boy. They met Dr. Ellwood Harvey of Philadelphia in front of the White House in November 1855, and Weems pretended to be a male buggy driver. She drove Harvey from Washington to Philadelphia, where Harvey took her to the house of another abolitionist, William Still, for Thanksgiving. The next day Dr. Harvey took Weems across the river to Camden, New Jersey, and on to New York City. In Brooklyn he took her to Rev. Charles Ray&#x27;s house. Ray took her to the home of Lewis Tappan, where the only photo of Weems was taken in her &quot;boy disguise&quot;. Rev. Freeman accompanied Weems from there by train to Canada, where she reached safety at her uncle and aunt&#x27;s house in Ontario. It is likely that is where Freeman first met the radical American abolitionist, John Brown. Later Brown stopped at Freeman&#x27;s church in Brooklyn in 1859, while en route to his raid at Harpers Ferry.

==Later years==
In 1860, Rev. Freeman was called as pastor of the Congregationalist Talcott Street Church in Hartford, Connecticut. Four years later, Rev. Freeman and family returned to Brooklyn, where he rejoined the congregation at Siloam Presbyterian Church. Freeman served there until his retirement in 1885. Christiana Williams Freeman worked at the Colored Orphans Home in New York City, where she helped protect the children during the New York Draft Riots of 1863. Rev. Freeman died at his home in Brooklyn. Both Freemans are buried at The Evergreen Cemetery in Brooklyn.

==Legacy and honors==
*The &quot;Home of Amos Noe and Christiana Williams Freeman&quot; is on the Portland Freedom Trail in Maine, and a plaque was installed in their honor.

<text>The Cathedral Church of St. James is an Anglican cathedral in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the location of the oldest congregation in the city, with the parish being established in 1797. The church, the fourth on the site, began construction in 1850 and opened for services on June 19, 1853. It was one of the largest buildings in the city at that time. It was designed by Frederick William Cumberland and is an example of Gothic Revival architecture.

The church building is designated under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;. It has been the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Toronto since 1936 after the &quot;cathedra&quot; was moved from the Diocese&#x27;s first cathedral, the Cathedral of St. Alban the Martyr. The church&#x27;s choir school is Royal St. George&#x27;s College in The Annex neighbourhood, which is open to boys in grades 3 through 12.

==History==
The Anglican parish of St. James was established in 1797 in the then-town of York. In 1807, the first church was built of wood. It was used in 1813 as a hospital during the War of 1812, and it was subsequently robbed and damaged by the American troops. Shortly after, in 1818, the church was enlarged and a bell tower addition was completed. The bell was used as a fire bell for the town.

In 1833, the wooden structure was taken down and replaced by a stone structure in the Neoclassical style. In January 1839, the church burned down and was reconstructed. It reopened in December 1839, and the church became a cathedral in 1936. St. James Cemetery, the parish cemetery, was moved in the 1840s to St. James-the-Less at Parliament and Bloor streets, although there are still unmarked graves under the church parking lot.

In 1849, the building was destroyed in the first Great Fire of Toronto. An international architectural competition was held to replace it, drawing eleven entries from Canada and the United States. The Gothic Revival design by Frederick William Cumberland and Thomas Ridout placed first, followed by the submissions of John Ostell and Kivas Tully respectively.

Construction began on July 1, 1850. The cornerstone was laid on November 20, 1850 by the Bishop of Toronto John Strachan and Reverend Grasset. Inside the cornerstone was placed a sealed bottle containing a Scobie&#x27;s 1851 almanac, reports and documents of the Church Society, and a collection of coins. The Ohio stone and brick church was opened to the public in 1853. Its original organ was built in 1853 by Samuel Russell Warren. Upon his death in 1867, Strachan, Toronto&#x27;s first Anglican bishop, was buried in a vault beneath the high altar. Dean Henry James Grasett (1808–1882) was also buried here.

It was not until 1873–1874 that the tower and spire, the transepts, and the pinnacles and finials were completed by architect Henry Langley. The spire was the tallest structure in Canada upon completion and would remain so for another 25 years until the construction of Toronto&#x27;s Old City Hall. The tower&#x27;s clock was installed one year later.

In 1889, side galleries and aisles were removed, and the choir stalls and organ console were installed in the chancel. In 1936, St. George&#x27;s Chapel was dedicated, and the organ was overhauled by Casavant Frères.

Major renovations were completed in 1982. The parish celebrated its bicentenary in 1997, when the peal of 12 change ringing bells was installed as the largest peal in North America. They are one of only nine peals of 12 bells outside the British Isles, and one of only two in North America, the other being located at Trinity Church in New York City.

To raise money to help pay for the rising costs of maintaining the cathedral, part of the grounds were planned to be sold to a condominium developer. Part of the land was to have been part of the original cemetery, and the developers planned to move the graves in order to clear the land. A public outcry ensued, and a deal was made to sell off a parking lot to the northwest of the cathedral for the SP!RE condominium development.

==Architecture==
St. James Cathedral&#x27;s Gothic Revival architecture is reflected throughout the structure. Every part of a Gothic cathedral is directly related to a &quot;core dimension&quot; which is used as an effort to achieve harmony and organic unity within the building where everything is linked rationally and proportionally, creating a coherent whole. Every element in the cathedral—including the stained glass windows, the pointed arches, high ceilings, the pinnacles, even the flying buttresses—allow as much light as possible to flood the interior. The Gothic style means an aesthetically unified whole, but the combination of different architectural elements such as the ribbed vaults, flying buttresses, and pointed arches allows for generous illumination of the interior space with natural light.

===Exterior===
The cathedral&#x27;s exterior is composed of white brick and Ohio sandstone. Several layers of brick in the facade create strong, square inset designs around the lancet windows of the clerestory. This allows for a play of light and shadow that dramatizes the heaviness of the wall, and was the effect of emphasizing the wall&#x27;s depth by partially cutting into it. The spires are built of stone and decorated with pinnacles and dormers, and ball flower ornaments atop the pinnacles. Tower walls are reinforced with square and octagonal buttresses that taper abruptly with generous weatherings at transitional points and terminate in pinnacles, some with slender colonettes abutting chamfered edges, with ribbed, stepped, or gable caps. These buttresses are accented by heavy weatherings in lighter coloured stone (creating visual contrast while drawing attention to the points of stress on the building), and topped with pinnacles, thus emphasizing their massiveness, structural function, and verticality. They provide spatial rhythm on the east and west facades.

A careful balance between horizontal and vertical elements can be observed throughout the interior and exterior of the church. On the exterior, a dog-toothed fret runs along the aisle roofline, while on the interior, a band of continuous painted bosses similarly run along the top of the aisle wall. These horizontal bands balance the composition against the verticality of the exterior tower and pinnacles, and the interior pointed arches of the nave arcade, creating a sense of stability and repose.

At , the tower and spire have remained the tallest in Canada and the second tallest in North America after St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York—although the spire of St. James is still shorter than the dome of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory in Montreal, which is the tallest church in the Western Hemisphere. The tower has five bells that still ring through the city today, and the chiming clock is &quot;one of the finest examples of a chiming public clock anywhere in the world.&quot; At the turn of the 20th century, St James&#x27; Cathedral was still the tallest building in Toronto, and was often the first thing immigrants noticed when they stepped off the train at the old Union Station.

The total length of the cathedral is , with a maximum width of . A four sided arch with steeple was erected alongside the cathedral as a military memorial. St. James Park neighbors the building.

===Interior===

Over the principal entrance, a carved organ cover rises over a royal coat of arms, while Minton tile-work lies underfoot. The organ has 5000 pipes and includes the original gallery organ from 1853 over the main south entrance at the rear of the cathedral. Trumpet pipes have since been added to the gallery organ. The front chancel and aisle pipes were added in 1916.

In the interior, the absence of galleries frees the vertical movement of the arcade and clerestory. A high-pitched roof of heavy timber, crowned with enriched ribs and carved bosses creates a sense of shelter to the nave. The exposed rafters of the roof of the nave are articulated structural elements, and broad tie-beams and decorative cornices accent the joints. The elegant vault of the apsidal chancel, though expressing the thrust from the vault in the ribs that flow down to the ground, is a sham vault of lath and plaster that is coloured to represent stone.

The division of the interior into six bays is reflected on the exterior by the buttresses along the east and west elevations.
Pews flow through the arcade in rows of four, gallery fronts, and chancel panelling is all black walnut, as are the Corinthian capitals. Glazing bars of windows in sash of varying widths are reminiscent of Gothic tracery, creating divisions in the stained glass.

The cathedral is oriented on a north–south axis, whereas the traditional orientation is on an east–west axis with the altar at the east end. The orientation, decided by the design committee at the time, conforms to the symbolic representation of the church at the time, when the conflict with the American troops was apparent. The pews are oriented in central rows, with aisles on each side. The comfort of the seating was not highly regarded in the design.

==Notable funerals==
In addition to the funerals of former Bishops of Toronto, there have been notable funerals at St. James for other prominent people from the Toronto area, including:
* George Snell (1907–2006), former Bishop of Toronto from 1966 to 1972 – funeral in 2006
* Ted Rogers (1939–2008), businessman and founder of Rogers Communications – funeral on December 9, 2008
* Jim Flaherty (1949–2014), former Ontario MPP, federal MP and minister of finance – state funeral on April 16, 2014
* Rob Ford (1969–2016), former mayor of Toronto and city councillor (Ward 2) – civic funeral on March 30, 2016
Rev. George Okill Stuart, who served from 1800 to 1812, and the Rev. John Strachan have the only graves located within the cathedral.

<doc id="1135652" wikidata="Q161218" url="?curid=1135652" title="SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer">
<text>SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer () was (from 1942 to 1945) the highest commissioned rank in the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS), with the exception of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, which became a commissioned rank when held by SS commander Heinrich Himmler. The rank is translated as &quot;highest group leader&quot; and alternatively as &quot;colonel group leader&quot;. The rank was correctly spelled &quot;Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; to avoid confusion with the more junior rank of &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;.

== Overview ==
&quot;Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; was considered the equivalent of a colonel general (&quot;Generaloberst&quot;) in the German Army, which is generally seen as the equivalent of a four-star general or army general in other armed forces. Under Himmler, the title became the highest possible commissioned rank in the SS hierarchy of the .

The rank of &quot;Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; was first proposed in early 1942 as a possible future rank for Waffen-SS commanders who might be promoted to command Army Groups. The &quot;Heer&quot; leadership immediately opposed the creation of an SS-Colonel General rank, since army commanders felt that no SS general should hold such a large amount of authority and that SS combat commands should be restricted to the Corps and Division level. The idea of SS Armies and Army Groups was something few wished to see develop – two SS Armies would eventually be established, (the 6th and the 11th SS Armies). No SS Army Groups were ever created.

== Promotion history ==

In April 1942, on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal authority, the rank of SS-&quot;&quot; was first bestowed. The appointment was to Nazi Party treasurer and RZM chief Franz Xaver Schwarz. On the same day orders were issued for a dual promotion within the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;, making Kurt Daluege an &quot;Generaloberst der Polizei&quot; at the same time. Daluege&#x27;s rank was the only police promotion to this rank.

The last two of the four &quot;Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; promotions were made in 1944, this time to Waffen-SS generals. Dietrich&#x27;s date of rank was back-dated to 1942, making him the most senior officer of the Waffen-SS. The final seniority list was as follows:

* Franz Xaver Schwarz, 20 April 1942 (&quot;... der Allgemeinen SS&quot;)
* Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Dietrich, 20 April 1942 (&quot;... und Panzer-Generaloberst der Waffen-SS&quot;)
* Kurt Daluege, 20 April 1942 (&quot;... und Generaloberst der Polizei&quot;)
* Paul Hausser, 1 August 1944 (&quot;... und Generaloberst der Waffen-SS&quot;)

Franz Xaver Schwarz, who held &quot;Ehrenführer&quot; (honorary leader), was the only holder of the rank who was not granted equivalent police or Waffen-SS rank. The &quot;Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; rank was worn on the field-grey Waffen-SS tunic, the grey SS service tunic, or in Daluege&#x27;s case the German police uniform. There are no photographic records of the insignia ever being worn on the black ceremonial uniform, which had largely fallen into disuse by the time the rank was created.

In 1944, Himmler offered to appoint Albert Speer to the honorary rank of &quot;Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot;. Speer declined, not wishing to formally be subordinate to Himmler. Himmler&#x27;s successor, Karl Hanke, never held the rank of &quot;Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot;, but was appointed &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; from the lower grade of &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. Hans-Adolf Prützmann claimed to have been promoted to the rank in April 1945 by personal decree of Adolf Hitler; Prützmann&#x27;s claim is not supported by either documentary or photographic evidence, leading most history texts to list his final rank as &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;.

== Murder of Eric Levack ==
In 2003, grade nine student Eric Levack, 14, was murdered in the wooded area behind the school during lunch break. The perpetrator was classmate Justin Morton, also 14. Morton pleaded guilty to first degree murder and in 2004 was sentenced as an adult to life in prison, with no eligibility of parole for seven years. Morton was the first person in Canada charged with first degree murder under the newly enacted &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot;, which came into force on April 1, 2003, the day of the murder. Morton anonymously appeared in the 2007 documentary film &quot;In the Shadow of Feeling&quot;, which focused on psychopathic personalities, and spoke about the murder. A lilac tree, planted in memory of Levack, stands on the lawn in front of Heart Lake Secondary School.

<doc id="1135654" wikidata="Q4676391" url="?curid=1135654" title="Acrophobia (game)">
<text>Acrophobia is an online multiplayer word game. The game was originally conceived by Andrea Shubert, and programmed by Kenrick Mock and Michelle Hoyle in 1995. Originally available over Internet Relay Chat, the game has since been developed into a number of variants, as a download, playable through a browser, via Twitter or through Facebook.

==Background==
Created by Andrea Shubert in the mid to late 1990s, she developed a &quot;spiritual successor&quot; called TAG: The Acronym Game for startup gaming company play140.

==Gameplay==
Players enter a channel hosted by a bot which runs the game. In each round, the bot generates a random acronym. Players compete by racing to create the most coherent or humorous sentence that fits the acronym - in essence, a backronym. After a set amount of time expires, each player then votes anonymously via the bot for their favorite answer (aside from their own).

Points are awarded to the most popular backronym. Bonus points also may be given based on the fastest response and for voting for the winning option. Some implementations give the speed bonus to the player with the first answer that received at least one vote; this is to discourage players from quickly entering gibberish just to be the first. Bonus points for voting for the winner helps discourage players from intentionally voting for poor answers to avoid giving votes to answers that might beat their own.

Some versions of the game were criticized for the ease with which players could disrupt games with obscenities, and the anonymous nature of the site meant that there were no repercussions for this behavior. Usually, nonsense backronyms will score low and the most humorous sounding backronym which effectively makes a sentence from the initials will win. Some rounds may have a specific topic that the answers should fit, although enforcement of the topic depends on solely on the other players&#x27; willingness to vote for off-topic answers.

&quot;Acrophobia&quot; was commended as an online game that showed the potential for educational use, and that its use of technology allowed &quot;imaginative play, instant feedback, and [an] unusual scoring system.&quot;

An example game typically goes as follows:
*a 3-letter round
*a 4-letter round
*a 5-letter round
*a 6-letter round
*a 7-letter round

Then, it goes back to 3 letters and starts the cycle over.

Once one player reaches 30 points, the top two players at this point are chosen to face-off. In the face-off rounds, the two players enter their acronyms and everyone else votes not knowing which acronym is from which player. Each face-off round lasts about 20 seconds and consists of:
*a 3-letter round
*a 4-letter round
*a 5-letter round
The player with the most points from the face-off round wins the game.

==Reception==
&quot;Acrophobia&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1997 &quot;Puzzle Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Smart Games Challenge 2&quot;. However, it won GameSpot&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Best Online-Only Game&quot; award; the editors wrote, &quot;Besides being a fun and very addictive game, the great thing about Acrophobia is the social experience.&quot;

<doc id="1135655" wikidata="Q7165973" url="?curid=1135655" title="People of the Black Mountains">
<text>People of the Black Mountains is an historical novel by Raymond Williams.

This book is a work in two volumes, published in 1989 and 1990. It features a great diversity of people in a single place across the ages. Most of them are ordinary people living unprivileged lives. It is told through a series of flashbacks featuring an ordinary man in modern times. He is looking for his grandfather who has not returned from a hill-walk, but has visions of the past as it might have been.

It begins in the Old Stone Age and extends through to the Middle Ages, telling a series of fictionalized short stories about ordinary people in the Welsh-border region of the Black Mountains where he was born and grew up.

The series is solidly based on what archaeologists have found – some of the tales are speculative reconstructions based on real burials. It has been praised for &quot;brilliant clarity and imaginative vision&quot; (&quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;) and hailed as &quot;the great historic novel Wales has long deserved&quot; (&quot;Wales on Sunday&quot;).

The story-sequence would have extended to modern times had Williams lived to finish it. What exists is a complete story arc extending from the Old Stone Age to the late-Mediaeval period. The story begins in the Old Stone Age and was intended to come right up to modern times, always focusing on ordinary people. He had completed it as mediaeval times when he died in 1988. It was prepared for publication by his wife Joy Williams and was published in two volumes, along with a Postscript that gives a brief description of what the remaining work would have been.

== Stories include ==

* Primitive hunters living before the last Ice-age
* Similar hunter gatherers returning after the ice, and their possible marriage-customs
* The arrival of the first Neolithic farmers; in this case pastoralists with sheep, which the local hunters don&#x27;t initially recognise as creatures they should not hunt.
* A visiting astronomer-priest from the culture that later produced the Stonehenge trilithons
* Peaceful people are hit by murderous raiders, and realise that they will have to adapt to be secure
* The same people a few generations on get taken over by a professional warrior, who says he is there to help
* Celtic warriors now dominate, and their values contradict those of the older peoples
* The defeat of a Roman force by Welsh tribesmen, the Silures. 
* &#x27;King Arthur&#x27;, here seen as Artorius, a warlord who had defeated the Saxons but here seen as a burden to the ordinary farmers who produced the food that the warriors ate. 
* Harold Godwinson riding through, having briefly chased out the Normans during the reign of Edward the Confessor. 
* The Normans pushing into Wales after 1066
* A local revolt that merges into the general rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr in the early 15th century.
* Sir John Oldcastle seeking refuge after being persecuted for supporting the Lollards.

<doc id="1135658" wikidata="Q302528" url="?curid=1135658" title="Toronto Marathon">
<text>The Toronto Marathon, held annually on the first Sunday of May, is a race from Yonge and Sheppard, in the north end of Toronto, to Exhibition Place, via Humber Bay Park. The origins of the event trace back to 1977, and the race was initially called the Canadian International Marathon. In 2003, its name was changed to the Toronto Marathon. It was held previously on the third Sunday in October, the first Sunday after Canadian Thanksgiving, for 16 consecutive years. In 2011, the race was moved to May due to pressure from the government of Toronto over repeated road closures in October due to the Toronto Waterfront Marathon also held that month and from Scotiabank, the sponsor of the Waterfront Marathon. The Toronto Marathon was moved to the first Sunday of May in 2012. The event was temporarily held mid-May in 2011, due to other events in the city that year. 

In addition to a full marathon, the event also includes a half marathon, a 10K run, a 5K run, and an eight-person relay across the marathon course. The marathon meets international standards and is a qualifier for the Boston Marathon. The event is a member of AIMS and Athletics Ontario and meets their criteria.

The race featured women marathoners prior to the opening of the Olympic competition for the women. In 1984, Anne Hird won the race as winds gusted and a large field pursued her. In 1988, the winner was Susan Stone, who had just become the Canadian National Champion in the 10K two weeks prior to the race.

Regularly attracting 8,000 to 10,000 participants from over 55 countries, and every Province and Territory in Canada, the event is also a major fundraiser for many charities. A Runners Expo is held on the Friday and Saturday at the Queen Elizabeth building on the Exhibition Grounds immediately prior to race day and features over 60 vendors as well as the race kit pick-up for event participants. 

== COVID-19 pandemic ==
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition of the race was cancelled, while the 2021 edition of the race was virtualized, as organizers stated that COVID-19 vaccine distribution will not be wide enough by May 2021 in order to allow the live in-person racing event to be safely held by that spring.

== 2018 distance controversy ==
In 2018, the Toronto Marathon was accused of having an incorrect distance. Participants using GPS devices believed that the marathon course was 43km even though it was supposed to be 42.2km. The organizers claim that this is not true and that &quot;the distance is 100 per cent correct&quot; The course was proven to be measured correctly and km points designated accurate. It is known that when using a GPS, the signal can be inaccurate, especially around tall structures like those found in the downtown core, and that it caused an inaccurate reading for some runners using this technology. The course is certified by AIMS and Athletics Canada meeting their measurement criteria and is re-surveyed every 5 to 10 years as required by these respective organizations.

<doc id="1135659" wikidata="Q7475315" url="?curid=1135659" title="WATFIV">
<text>WATFIV (Waterloo FORTRAN IV), developed at the University of Waterloo, Canada is an implementation of the Fortran computer programming language. It is the successor of WATFOR.

WATFIV was used from the late 1960s into the mid-1980s. WATFIV was in turn succeeded by later versions of WATFOR.
Because it could complete the three usual steps (&quot;compile-link-go&quot;) in just one pass, the system became popular for teaching students computer programming.

==History==
In the early 1960s, newly formed computer science departments started university programs to teach computer programming languages. The Fortran language had been developed at IBM, but suffered from slow and error-prone three-stage batch processing workflow. In the first stage, the compiler started with source code and produced object code. In the second stage, a linker constructed a complete program using growing libraries of common functions. Finally, the program was repeatedly executed with data for the typical scientific and business problems of customers. Each step often included a new set of punched cards or tape. Students, on the other hand, had very different requirements. Their programs were generally short, but usually contained logic and syntax errors, resulting in time-consuming repetition of the steps and confusing &quot;core dumps&quot; (It often took a full day to submit and receive the successful or failed output from the computer operator). Once their programs worked correctly, they were turned in and not run again.

In 1961, the University of Wisconsin developed a technology called FORGO for the IBM 1620 which combined some of the steps.
Similar experiments were carried out at Purdue University on the IBM 7090 in a system called PUFFT.

===WATFOR 7040===
In summer 1965, four undergraduate students of the University of Waterloo, Gus German, James G. Mitchell
Richard Shirley and Robert Zarnke, led by Peter Shantz, developed a Fortran compiler for the IBM 7040 computer called WATFOR. Its objectives were fast compilation speed and effective error diagnostics at both compile and execution time. It eliminates the need for a separate linking step and, as a result, FORTRAN programs which contain no syntax errors are placed into immediate execution. Professor J. Wesley Graham provided leadership throughout the project.

This simple, one-step process allowed non-experienced programmers to learn programming with lower cost in time and computing resources.
To aid in debugging, the compiler uses an innovative approach to checking for undefined variables (an extremely common mistake by novice programmers). It uses a diagnostic feature of the 7040 that can deliberately set areas of memory to bad parity. When a program tries to reference variables that hadn&#x27;t been set, the machine takes an interrupt (handled by the Watfor runtime routines) and the error is reported to the user as an undefined variable. This has the pleasant side effect of checking for undefined variables with essentially no CPU overhead.

WATFOR quickly gained popularity and over 75 institutions installed it on their IBM 7040 systems. The distribution of the compiler was handled by Sandra Bruce (née Hope).

===WATFOR 360===
In 1966, the University planned to replace the 7040 with an IBM System/360 computer, which was much faster but not software compatible. A team of full-time employees and undergraduate students was formed to write an IBM 360 version. The project members, Betty Schmidt, Paul Dirksen, Paul H. Cress, Lothar K. &quot;Ned&quot; Kesselhut, Bill Kindree and Dereck Meek, were later joined by Mike Doyle, Rod Milne, Ron Hurdal and Lynn Williams, completed 360 WATFOR in the early part of 1967. Many other institutions (universities, colleges, businesses and governmental agencies) started using the WATFOR compiler to meet needs similar to those experienced at the University of Waterloo. The distribution of the software and customer support was carried on by Sandra Ward.

===WATFIV===
As a result of proposals from the SHARE user group Fortran committee and others, a new version called WATFIV was produced in 1968. WATFIV introduced new features such as CHARACTER variables and direct-access input-output. The Association for Computing Machinery presented Paul Cress and Paul Dirksen the Grace Murray Hopper Award for contributions to the WATFOR and WATFIV projects in 1972. The WATFIV compiler was included in the DATAPRO Honour Roll for 1975 and 1976.
People involved with maintenance and enhancement included Bernie Murphy, Martin Wiseman and Yvonne Johnson.

WATFIV was pronounced as &quot;WHAT FIVE&quot;, but, as was realized at the time, could also (almost) still be pronounced as &quot;WHAT FOR&quot;, as in WAT-F-IV (Waterloo Fortran IV).

Universities and corporations used these compilers and a number of other software products have been developed in the WATFOR tradition.
For example, a version for the COBOL programming language is called WATBOL.
Daniel D. McCracken said &quot;it is no exaggeration to suggest that WATFOR revolutionized the use of computers in education.&quot; At one point, more than 3,000 mini and mainframe computer licenses and over 100,000 microcomputer licenses were held worldwide for this family of software products.

===WATFOR-11, -S and -11S===
In 1974, a compiler with characteristics similar to the IBM implementation was created for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer and called WATFOR-11. The team members, Jack Schueler, Jim Welch and Terry Wilkinson, were later joined by Ian McPhee who had added new control statements to the WATFIV compiler for structured programming (SP). These new statements included the block IF (later included in the ANSI X3.9-1978 language standard), WHILE, UNTIL, and others. WATFIV-S was announced in 1974 and a few months later, WATFOR-11S (the &quot;S&quot; indicating the new SP features) was also announced. The original SP features were later enhanced with additional statements by Bruce Hay in WATFIV-S in 1980 and by Jack Schueler in WATFOR-11S in 1981.

===WATFOR-77===
During the 1970s, the ANSI X3J3 subcommittee (the FORTRAN language standard group) developed a new language standard which was officially approved in April, 1978. This standard, designated FORTRAN 77, introduced many new statements into the language. In fact, the previous language standard FORTRAN 66 is a very small document and describes, what is in effect, a subset of most implementations of FORTRAN. For example, the WATFIV and WATFOR-11 implementations are based upon the IBM definition of FORTRAN-IV.

As programmers used the FORTRAN 77 features, a new compiler was required to combine the advantages of the WATFIV compiler with the new language standard. In January 1983, a project to develop a FORTRAN 77 compiler was started at Watcom Systems Inc. Under the leadership of Jack Schueler, Watcom employees and undergraduate students from the University of Waterloo&#x27;s Co-operative Computer Science program became involved in the creation of the WATFOR-77 compiler. The major work was done by Geno Coschi, Fred Crigger, John Dahms, Jim Graham, Jack Schueler, Anthony Scian and Paul Van Oorschot. They were assisted by Rod Cremasco, John McCormick, David McKee and Brian Stecher. Many of the team members from former compiler projects provided input. These included Bruce Hay, Ian McPhee, Sandra Ward, Jim Welch and Terry Wilkinson.

Unlike previous compilers, a significant portion of WATFOR-77 was written in a portable systems language to ease the implementation of the compiler on other computer systems. Earlier WATFOR compilers were written entirely in machine-dependent assembly language.

Two components of the compiler are not portable. The code generator translates FORTRAN statements into native computer instructions and stores them in memory. The first version of WATFOR-77 generates instructions for the IBM 370 computer architecture. Most of the execution-time support (undefined variable checking, subscript evaluation, intrinsic functions) was written in assembly language for good performance.
In September 1984, the first version was installed at the University of Waterloo for the Department of Computing Services. It was an implementation for IBM 370 computers running the VM/SP CMS operating system.

A few months earlier, in May 1984, a project started to implement the WATFOR-77 compiler on the IBM Personal Computer. This project included Geno Coschi, Fred Crigger, Tim Galvin, Athos Kasapi, Jack Schueler, Terry Skomorowski and Brian Stecher.
In April 1985, this second version of WATFOR-77 was installed at the University of Waterloo for use by students of the Faculty of Engineering. The compiler can run on a 256K IBM Personal Computer using IBM PC DOS 2.0 and does not require special floating-point hardware.

In the fall of 1985, a Japanese version of WATFOR-77 was delivered to IBM Japan for the IBM JX Personal Computer. This version produces Japanese language error messages and supported the Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana character sets for variable names and character strings. To support the JX, the Language Reference manual and User&#x27;s Guide were translated into Japanese. Another version of WATFOR-77 with the same features mentioned above was also developed for Japanese IBM PS/55 family of personal computers in Spring 1988.

During the summer of 1986, the IBM PC version of WATFOR-77 was adapted to run on the Unisys ICON which runs the QNX operating system. Since QNX is quite different from IBM PC DOS, parts of the run-time system were rewritten. This implementation of WATFOR-77 was made available in September 1986.

During the summer of 1985, a project was started to adapt WATFOR-77 to the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX computer series running the VMS operating system. The members of this project included Geno Coschi, Marc Ouellette, Jack Schueler and Terry Skomorowski. This implementation was made available in March 1987.

Also, in the spring of 1988, a new project was begun to develop an optimizing FORTRAN 77 compiler. This compiler uses the code generator from the Watcom C compiler, which produces superior machine code to other C compilers. The FORTRAN 77 optimizing compiler was first shipped in mid-1990.

In October 1990, the 25th anniversary of WATFOR was celebrated. Many involved in the development of the WATFOR compilers were invited to the University of Waterloo for a reunion.

In spring 1992, a version of WATFOR-77 was adapted to the NEC PC-9801 family of personal computers. This version was similar to the IBM PS/55 version but modified to accommodate architectural differences.
In January 1992, development of a 32-bit version of WATFOR-77 for Intel 80386 and Intel 80486 personal computers began. The first version was shipped in the fall of 1992.

As late as 1995, classes for programming in WATFIV were still being held at the University of Mississippi, led by Professor Charles H. (Chuckie) Franke.

<text>Steve J. Morse (born July 28, 1954) is an American guitarist and songwriter. A seven-time Grammy nominee, he is best known as the founder of the Dixie Dregs and as the longest serving guitarist for Deep Purple. Morse also enjoyed a successful solo career and was a member of the group Kansas in the mid-1980s. Most recently, Morse became a member of the supergroup Flying Colors.

== Early life and education ==

Steve Morse was born in Hamilton, Ohio. His family soon moved to Tennessee and then to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where Morse spent his childhood. Although familiar with piano and clarinet, Morse ultimately became a guitarist.

Morse worked briefly with his older brother Dave in a band called the Plague until the family moved to Augusta, Georgia. In the late 1960s, he played in a band called Three with his older brother and a junior high schoolmate, William Gerald (Jerry) Wooten, who played keyboards. The three performed at a local psychedelic youth club, the Glass Onion, and at Legion Halls and church functions.

While enrolled in the Academy of Richmond County, Morse met bassist Andy West and together they formed the Dixie Grit, adding keyboardist Johnny Carr and guitarist and vocalist Frank Brittingham, with Dave Morse drumming. This short-lived group played material from groups such as Led Zeppelin and Cream. West and Morse continued to play as a duet billed as the Dixie Dregs until Morse&#x27;s expulsion from school in the 10th grade for refusing to cut his hair.

Steve completed 11th grade at a local Catholic school and was eligible for early college enrollment. He enrolled at the University of Miami School of Music. 

During the 1970s, the University of Miami played host to a number of future influential musicians, including Bruce Hornsby, Pat Metheny, and Jaco Pastorius. Andy West also enrolled at the University of Miami, and with Morse, drummer Bart Yarnold, keyboardist Frank Josephs and violinist Allen Sloan, collaborated in a lab project entitled Rock Ensemble II. In 1975, the group compiled a recording used for promotional efforts. It was originally released on vinyl in 1976, and again on CD in 1997 as &quot;The Great Spectacular&quot;.

From late 1987 to early 1988, Morse worked as a commercial airline co-pilot. He has lived in Ocala, Florida since 1991, where he is involved in hay farming.

== Dixie Dregs ==
Upon Morse&#x27;s graduation from the University of Miami, he and West officially named their group Dixie Dregs. A fellow University of Miami alumnus, Rod Morgenstein, replaced the injured Bart Yarnold and the band began performing regularly; with some of their own compositions, along with material by John McLaughlin and southern rock favorites. An increasingly heavier performance schedule eventually led to the attention of Capricorn Records recruiters including Allman Brothers Band manager Twiggs Lyndon, and in late 1976, the group was signed by the southern rock label.

Their first effort for Capricorn, &quot;Free Fall&quot;, established Morse as an important newcomer to the fusion genre, and he was recognized for both his compositional skills (having written all 11 tracks) and his musicianship. Although receiving positive reviews as a pivotal jazz fusion album, it sold poorly.

&quot;What If&quot; was released in 1978. Writing credits were more collaborative and the band&#x27;s sound had matured into more than what was strictly considered fusion at the time. Southern rock, classical, folk and country elements were combined to form a cohesive and listenable music. Although supported by a tour, record sales remained flat, but gained Morse and the band an invitation to perform at Montreux Jazz Festival on July 23, 1978. Four songs from the recorded performance were released the following year on &quot;Night of the Living Dregs&quot;. Capricorn went bankrupt in late 1979, and the Dixie Dregs were left without a label.

Arista Records signed the band in 1979 to record three albums. Production control was handed to Morse, and &quot;Dregs of the Earth&quot; was released in May 1980. All eight tracks were written by Morse, and the album peaked at number 27 on Billboard&#x27;s Jazz Album Chart.

Arista became increasingly concerned about Dixie Dregs&#x27; album sales and pressured the band to change their name to simply the Dregs in an attempt to increase the band&#x27;s visibility in the public eye. &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; included seven new Morse compositions, plus a shortened re-arrangement of &quot;Cruise Control,&quot; in early 1981, but the name change did little to address Arista&#x27;s worries. The Dregs felt compelled by label management to add lyrics to their next release, appropriately titled &quot;Industry Standard&quot;.

Morse&#x27;s compositions on &quot;Industry Standard&quot; began to sound more like his evolving solo work than Dregs&#x27; collaborations, and the album received critical and public praise. &quot;Industry Standard&quot; was voted &quot;Best Guitar LP&quot; by readers of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine in their annual reader&#x27;s poll that year. Additionally, Morse was voted &quot;Best Overall Guitarist&quot; in the same poll, an honor that he would hold for five consecutive years (which ended his eligibility by retiring him into their &quot;Gallery of Greats&quot;, a distinction shared only by Steve Howe of Yes and Eric Johnson). After fulfilling their commitment to Arista, the Dregs&#x27; members, who had tired of touring, disbanded in early 1983.

In the late 1980s, the group reunited for a tour featuring former members Morse, Morgenstein, Lavitz and Sloan. Their return was complemented by a &quot;Best Of&quot; release entitled &quot;Divided We Stand&quot;. Bassist Dave LaRue completed the lineup for a seven date tour culminating in the 1992 live album &quot;Bring &#x27;em Back Alive&quot;. Violinist Jerry Goodman, of Mahavishnu Orchestra fame, filled in for Sloan, who was frequently absent as a result of his medical career. They signed a deal with former label Capricorn Records for their first studio album in years, entitled &quot;Full Circle&quot;, in 1994.

== Steve Morse Band and Kansas ==
After the 1983 breakup of the Dregs, Morse then formed the Steve Morse Band, a trio with bassist Jerry Peek and drummer Doug Morgan (formerly a member of Glass Moon). After the first tour of the eastern United States, Morgan left for previous commitments; the choice to replace Morgan was Rod Morgenstein. They began recording &quot;The Introduction&quot; in September, which included British country guitarist Albert Lee making a guest appearance on the track General Lee. The group toured Germany in early 1984 with Morse conducting clinics, and the group was signed by Elektra Records, who released &quot;The Introduction&quot; mid-year. A second German tour began in December 1984 and &quot;Stand Up&quot; was released in 1985. This effort included guest vocalists and guitarists (Eric Johnson, Alex Ligertwood, Peter Frampton, Albert Lee, Van Temple), and violinist Mark O&#x27;Connor. He toured with Rush as a main opener on their Power Windows tour.

In 1986, Morse joined the rock group Kansas. During his time with the band they released two albums, &quot;Power&quot; and &quot;In the Spirit of Things&quot;. While he was with the band, Kansas had its last big hit, &quot;All I Wanted,&quot; which reached the Billboard Top 20 and on which Morse received co-writing credit. Morse left the band after touring behind the latter album. He re-joined the band for part of its 1991 tour.

Following this, Morse resumed the Steve Morse Band with new personnel (bassist Dave LaRue and drummer Van Romaine) and has released several further recordings, even after joining Deep Purple.

== Deep Purple ==
In 1994, Morse joined the British hard rock group Deep Purple, replacing Ritchie Blackmore (after Joe Satriani had initially replaced Blackmore on a temporary basis, for the final leg of The Battle Rages On tour in Japan, and European dates the following summer). With 28 years as a member of the band, Morse was their longest-serving guitarist and played on eight studio albums with them, between 1996&#x27;s &quot;Purpendicular&quot; and 2021&#x27;s &quot;Turning to Crime&quot;, and appeared on several live albums.

His departure from Deep Purple, announced on 23 July 2022, was driven by the illness of his wife Janine.

== Living Loud ==
In addition to playing with Deep Purple, Morse, together with Jimmy Barnes, Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake and Don Airey, formed Living Loud in 2003. The group released one studio album and a live DVD in 2004/2005. In Spring 2010 it was reported that Steve Morse and Bob Daisley started work on a new studio album which was set for a release in 2011, but nothing came of this.

== Angelfire ==
Morse began a collaboration with singer Sarah Spencer in 2007 entitled Angelfire. The album, of the same name, was released on August 10, 2010, on Radiant Records. The album features Dave LaRue and Van Romaine of the Steve Morse Band on bass and drums, respectively. The album has a textural, acoustic sound that differs from Morse&#x27;s previous work. Angelfire opened for the Steve Morse Band for several shows in California (January) and Florida (March) of 2010.

== Flying Colors ==
In 2011, Morse joined Flying Colors, an American supergroup composed of Mike Portnoy, Dave LaRue, Casey McPherson and Neal Morse, whose debut eponymous album was released on March 26, 2012, and debuted at No. 9 on Billboard&#x27;s Hard Rock chart, and No. 11 on the BBC&#x27;s Rock Album charts. Flying Colors released its second album, Second Nature, in 2014, and third album, Third Degree, in 2019, both to critical acclaim.

== G3 ==
In 2012 Steve Morse joined G3 project on their South American and European tour together with Steve Vai, John Petrucci and Joe Satriani.

== Artistry ==
Morse has proven himself throughout his career as capable of playing highly complex chord structures in classical sequences, as well as being able to play fast, alternate picked arpeggios. He is well known for using harmonics and improvising them in songs during live performances, such as in Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming&quot;.
=== Songwriting ===
Steve Morse has been characterized as a musical &quot;jack of all trades&quot;. In the words of &quot;Guitar Player&quot;&#x27;s Jas Obrecht, Morse seamlessly blends &quot;heavy metal, Baroque/classical, freeform jazz/rock, bluegrass, chicken pickin&#x27; country, Irish jigs&quot; with &quot;energy and finesse&quot;. In regard to his songwriting method, Morse stated:

Steve Morse is well-versed in a number of techniques - trilling, string skipping, alternate picking, artificial harmonics and legato - which he employs on his solos, guitar riffs and chord progressions.

=== Picking ===
Morse consciously avoids the use hammer-ons and pull-offs. While he contends these work for the blues-inspired licks of guitarists such as Alvin Lee, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, for faster and more technical music it&#x27;s better to pick all notes. This change of technique was inspired by Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, especially the guitar solos. One of his friends had a guitar magazine and showed him an article about the band. He said to Morse: &quot;Look, [Page] practices nine hours a day and he picks every note!&quot; Morse tried it out; he said that he &quot;lost a lot of the soul and fluidity of my playing, but I kept at it&quot; until he finally &quot;started to get a breakthrough.&quot; The definite turning point came when he watched the Mahavishnu Orchestra at the University of Miami playing &quot;Inner Mounting Flame&quot; (1971) live. That &quot;made a big impression&quot;. He also he noted that John McLaughlin &quot;was picking everything.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Morse is considered one of the hardest working guitarists in the world. He is widely known for his stylistically diverse compositional skills and was voted &quot;Best Overall Guitarist&quot; by &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine for five years in a row, qualifying him for its &quot;Guitar Player Hall of Fame&quot;, the only other members being Steve Howe of Yes and Eric Johnson. He is regularly cited by John Petrucci as a major influence. Guitarist Shawn Lane regarded Steve Morse as one of the most talented guitarists of his time. Ritchie Blackmore, who preceded Morse in Deep Purple, has stated, &quot;Steve Morse is an incredible player. A lot of people try to get some wisecrack out of me, but when you&#x27;re talking about guitar players along Morse&#x27;s caliber, they&#x27;re brilliant.&quot;

==Gear and equipment==
=== Guitars ===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Morse used his custom &quot;FrankenTele&quot; guitar. It was made up of a Fender Telecaster body with a Stratocaster neck, a Gibson trapeze-style tailpiece (coming from a twelve-string guitar) and four pickups in HSSH configuration. At one time, the guitar had a fifth pickup, a hexaphonic pickup with a separate output for each string; it provided the signal to drive a 360 Systems Spectre guitar synthesizer. Morse has an exact replica of this guitar at home &quot;in case the worst happens.&quot;

Morse also used a black Fender Lead III circa 1982, being featured on the ads of this guitar series.

Morse worked with Music Man Guitars to create two signature models: a modernized version of Morse&#x27;s first &quot;Frankenstein Telecaster&quot; guitar (Steve Morse Signature), and the Steve Morse SM Y-2D, is an updated version with quilted maple top.

===Pickups===
Morse has released two signature humbuckers with DiMarzio; the DP 205 Neck model and the DP 200 Bridge model. They are evenly balanced to allow playing all over the fretboard, since Morse plays high notes on the neck pickup and low ones on the bridge. They are the main pickups into his signature model. Dimarzio also wires a custom wound single coil pickup for Music Man to use into the SM signature model.

===Amplification===
Morse is an endorser of ENGL amps. He has released a signature model, the ENGL E-656 Steve Morse signature amplifier. It is a three channel amp specially designed by Morse with a custom version of the famous ENGL &quot;midrange matrix&quot;. In the past he used Peavey 5150 amps with Deep Purple, Marshall Jubilee, Peavey VTM 120 and Ampeg V4.

===Live setup===
Morse&#x27;s live equipment includes two ENGL E 656 Signature heads and several Music Man guitars (both models), his #1 still being his favorite. He splits up his signal to six different cabinets; four dry (without any FX) and two wet (with FX). He uses three Ernie Ball expression pedals to blend the fx into the mix. He uses a custom Skrydstrup R&amp;D switching system to perform all the switching and the blending. His FX are very simple, consisting only of a Boss OC-3 Octaver and two delays: Electro-Harmonix Memory Man now replaced with the newest TC Electronic FlashBack TonePrint delay (Morse has created custom presets). He is also using a TC Electronic Polytune Mini guitar tuner.
His live setup for Deep Purple is discussed by him for Premier Guitar magazine&#x27;s Rig Rundown.

<text>Saint Deiniol (died 572) was traditionally the first Bishop of Bangor in the Kingdom of Gwynedd, Wales. The present Bangor Cathedral, dedicated to Deiniol, is said to be on the site where his monastery stood. He is venerated in Brittany as Saint Denoual. In English and Latin his name is sometimes rendered as Daniel.

==Life==
According to a Latin &quot;Life of Deiniol&quot;, preserved in Peniarth MS226 and transcribed in 1602 by Sir Thomas Williams of Trefriw, he was the son of Abbot Dunod Fawr, son of Pabo Post Prydain. The family, having lost their land in the North of England, were given land by the king of Powys, Cyngen Glodrydd. 

Deiniol embraced the religious life and is said to have studied under Cadoc of Llancarfan. Sir David Trevor describes Deiniol as one of the seven blessed cousins who had spent part of his early life as a hermit &quot;on the arm of Pembrokeshire&quot; but was called to be a bishop despite deficiencies in his formal education. Deiniol soon left Powys for Gwynedd where he founded the monastery of Bangor, Gwynedd under the patronage of Maelgwn Gwynedd who endowed it with lands and privileges, later raising it to the rank of the official seat of a bishop, sharing a common boundary with the principality of Gwynedd. Deiniol is said to have been consecrated to that See by St. Dubricius in the year 516. Deiniol spent the remainder of his days there as Abbot and Bishop.

He attended the Synod of Llanddewi Brefi in c. 545 with Saint David when the subject of rules for penance was being discussed. According to the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; Deiniol died in 584 and was buried on Bardsey Island. It is possible that this date, like the dates given for the deaths of David and Kentigern, is twelve years later than it should be, in which case the correct date is 572. The Cathedral Church of Saint Deiniol in Bangor is dedicated in his name.

==Legacy==
His cult in North Wales was quite extensive and several churches are dedicated to him, including Worthenbury near Wrexham and Hawarden, Flintshire in the north of Wales (as well as other churches in Flintshire). There are also dedicated churches at Llangarron, Llanfor, Llanuwchllyn, Eyton, and Itton; near Cardigan Bay there is a village of Llanddeiniol - &quot;parish of St Deiniol&quot; - which was once the name of Itton.

The church of Marchwiel is dedicated to Deiniol and there are also dedications at Itton in Monmouthshire and Llangarron in Herefordshire.

William Ewart Gladstone dedicated St Deiniol&#x27;s Library, a residential library in Hawarden, Flintshire, for arts students, in 1896.

In the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar for Wales and that of the Anglican Church in Wales, he is commemorated on the traditional date of 11 September. 
His name has been given to the Deiniol Centre, a shopping centre in Bangor.

He may be referenced in the name of the hymn tune, St. Denio (&quot;Immortal, invisible&quot;).

<doc id="1135697" wikidata="Q16237979" url="?curid=1135697" title="Mayo College">
<text>Mayo College (informally Mayo) is a boys-only private boarding school in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. It was founded in 1875 by the 6th Earl of Mayo, who was the Viceroy of India from 1869 to 1872, making it one of the oldest public boarding schools in India. 

The idea for the college was proposed in 1869 by Colonel Walter. It was founded in 1875 and Colonel Sir Oliver St John became its first principal. The founder intended to create an &quot;Eton of India&quot;. The 2nd Baron Lytton, Viceroy of India, said in a speech on campus in 1879: 
: &quot;The idea was well expressed long ago by Colonel Walter in an excellent and most suggestive report which may have influenced Lord Mayo when he founded the present college. In that very sensible report, Colonel Walter pointed out that what was then most needed for the education of India&#x27;s young rulers and nobles was an Indian Eton. Mayo is India&#x27;s Eton and you are India&#x27;s Eton boys&quot;.
It aimed to provide the leaders of the princely states with an education similar to that given by Eton College. The British built Mayo for the sons of the Indian upper classes, particularly the princes and nobles of India. Mayo College holds the privilege of educating many members of the Indian Royal Families and also the Royal family of Oman, Said bin Taimur (the 13th Sultan of Muscat and Oman) attended Mayo College from 1922 to 1927 where he mastered English and Urdu.

Mayo has been considered as one of the best Boarding School in the world.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms was composed from the design furnished by Lockwood Kipling, a former principal of the School of Arts, Lahore, and father of Rudyard Kipling.

In the upper centre of the shield are Mayo Arms and Quarterings, a Lion Rampant and an open hand. On the right and left are the sun and the moon, typical of Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi, the two great families of Rajputs. Below are the Panch Rang, the five sacred colours of the Rajputs, Red, Gold, Blue, White and Green. In the centre is a Rajput fort – two towers connected by a curtain. The supports are on the right: a Bhil warrior with string bow and full quiver of arrows. On the left a Rajput, armed at all points, wearing a steel helmet with three plumes, a shield on his back, a dagger and katar in his belt, and a suit of chain covered with embroidered cloth and gauntlet on his hand.

The motto &quot;Let there be Light&quot; is derived from the Bible. The badge is a peacock, the sacred bird of Rajputana, standing on a double-edged, two-handed Rajput sword called Khanda.

== History and traditions ==
* Mayo&#x27;s first student, H.H. Maharaja Mangal Singh of Alwar, arrived at the school gates in October 1875 on the back of an elephant accompanied by 300 retainers and a menagerie of tigers, camels and horses.
* One of the school&#x27;s traditions is meeting for tea on the lawns known as Mughal Gardens immediately after the Annual Prizegiving ceremony. It is believed that M.N. Kapur (who went on to become one of Modern School New Delhi&#x27;s most respected principals) did away with using a rope to divide English and Indian guests at this ceremony.
* The Annual Prizegiving, one of the oldest ceremonies at Mayo, has seen chief guests including Lord Irwin, Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford, governor general of India, Maharaja Hari Singh, last ruler of Kashmir, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, ex-president of India, Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur, Gayatri Devi of Jaipur, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, Zakir Hussain, ex-president of India, Karan Singh, Indira Gandhi, ex-prime minister of India, field marshal Sam Manekshaw, Sayyid Faher Bin Taimur of Oman, Birendra Shah, King of Nepal, Khushwant Singh, Madhavrao Scindia, Peter Ustinov, Jaswant Singh and LK Advani.

<text>Victor Josef Papanek (; 22 November 192310 January 1998) was an Austrian-born American designer and educator, who became a strong advocate of the socially and ecologically responsible design of products, tools, and community infrastructures. His book &quot;Design for the Real World&quot;, originally published in 1971 and translated into more than 24 languages, had lasting international impact.

== Early life ==
Victor Josef Papanek was born in Vienna, Austria, on 22 November 1923. There have been conflicting published information on Papanek&#x27;s birth date, and the dates range between 1923 and 1927. His mother was Helene (née Spitz) and his father was Richard Papanek, a Jewish deli owner. Victor was born during a time in Austria when it was a Social Democratic led state. He attended school in England. His father died in 1935, while serving in the French Army.

In 1939, following Nazi Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria, 15-year-old Papanek emigrated to the United States via Ellis Island as a refugee. In 1940, he taught German lessons at the New York YMCA.

Upon arrival to New York City, the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair was happening which included work by Raymond Loewy, this shaped some of Papanek&#x27;s early ideas on design as a form of Democracy. In the late 1940s, Papanek created his first New York City-based design consultancy called, &quot;Design Clinic&quot;.

==Education==
Papanek studied architecture with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Arizona in 1949. Papanek earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Cooper Union in New York (1950) and completed graduate studies in design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.A. 1955).

The Berlin emigre Paul Zucker had a significant influence on Papanek during his studies at Cooper Union.

== Career ==
Papanek created product designs for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Volvo of Sweden contracted design work with him, in order to create a taxi for the disabled.

He worked with a design team that prototyped an educational television set that could be utilized in the developing countries of Africa and produced in Japan for $9.00 per set (cost in 1970 dollars).

His designed products also included a remarkable transistor radio, made from ordinary metal food cans and powered by a burning candle, that was designed to actually be produced cheaply in developing countries. His design skills also took him into projects like an innovative method for dispersing seeds and fertilizer for reforestation in difficult-to-access land, as well as working with a design team on a human-powered vehicle capable of conveying a half-ton load, and another team to design a very early three-wheeled, wide-tired all-terrain vehicle.

Papanek received numerous awards, including a Distinguished Designer fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1988. The following year in 1989, he received the IKEA Foundation International Award.

=== Ideology and pedagogy ===
Papanek&#x27;s ideas on iconoclastic design, journalism, and his unique global approach to pedagogic initiatives was a radical shift away from the existing design movements of the 1960s and 1970s. His perception of design was of an object or system, specifically working as a political tool. With his interest in all aspects of design and how design affected people and the environment, Papanek felt that much of what was manufactured was inconvenient, often frivolous and even unsafe. His book &quot;Design for the Real World&quot; (1971), outlined many of these ideas.

=== Teaching ===
Throughout most of his career, Papanek taught design courses. He was an associate professor and the Head of the Department of Product Design in the School of Design at North Carolina State College (1962). Additionally, Papanek taught at the Ontario College of Art, the Rhode Island School of Design, Purdue University, the California Institute of the Arts (where he was dean), Kansas City Art Institute (from 1976 to 1981), University of Kansas (J.L. Constant Professor of Architecture and Design, 1982–1998), and other places in North America, Europe and elsewhere.

== Death and legacy ==
Papanek died on January 10, 1998, in Lawrence, Kansas, aged 74.

The &quot;Victor J Papanek Social Design Award&quot; was created as a joint venture between the Papanek Foundation, the University of Applied Arts Vienna, the Museum of Arts and Design and the Austrian Cultural Forum, to give an award to designed “projects that upheld Papanek’s vision of environmental and/or social responsibility”.

In 2015, the Parsons School of Design and the Victor Papanek Foundation of the University of Applied Arts Vienna held a symposium and exhibition, &quot;How Things Don’t Work: The Dreamspace of Victor Papanek.&quot;

In 2018–2021, the Vitra Design Museum and the Victor Papanek Foundation of the University of Applied Arts Vienna held a posthumous solo exhibition, &quot;Victor Papanek: The Politics of Design.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Papanek was married four times and had two daughters. His last spouse was Harlanne Herdman (married from 1966 to 1989, divorced), together they had one daughter. Winifred N. Nelson Higginbotham (married from 1951 to 1957, divorced), together they had one daughter. He often referred to Winifred as his first wife, even though she was not, and the last name &quot;Higginbotham&quot; was from Winifred&#x27;s first marriage. His first two wives were of Russian-Jewish ethnicity from Brooklyn, Ada M. Epstein (married from 1949 to , divorced) and Anna Lipschitz (married from 1944, divorced).

In June 1945, Papanek became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

<doc id="1135711" wikidata="Q3790100" url="?curid=1135711" title="David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson">
<text>Henry David Reginald Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson, PC (26 July 1890 – 24 December 1965) was a British Conservative politician, most popularly remembered for his tenure as Government Chief Whip in the 1930s. His reputation was of a stern disciplinarian who was one of the harshest and most effective whips. His sense of the popular mood led him know when to sacrifice unpopular ministers. He protected the appeasement-supporting government as long as he could.

However, some argue that there were weaknesses of his system because of the number of high-profile rebellions during his tenure.

==Background and education==
Margesson was the third child and elder son of Sir Mortimer Margesson and Lady Isabel, daughter of Frederick Hobart-Hampden, Lord Hobart, and sister of the 7th Earl of Buckinghamshire. He grew up in Worcestershire and was educated at Harrow School and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He did not complete his degree, choosing instead to seek his fortune in the United States of America. Margesson volunteered at the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and served as an adjutant in the 11th Hussars.

==Early political career, 1922–1931==
After the war, Margesson entered politics at the suggestion of Lord Lee of Fareham. In the 1922 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Upton.

Very soon after his election, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of Labour, Anderson Montague-Barlow. In the 1923 general election, he lost his seat, but at the 1924 general election, he returned to Parliament for Rugby, the seat for which he would sit for the next eighteen years. He defeated future Liberal National leader Ernest Brown in the process.

Margesson was appointed Assistant Government Whip. Two years later, he became a more senior whip with the title Junior Lord of the Treasury until the Conservatives&#x27; defeat, in the 1929 general election. In August 1931, he was reappointed to the same position upon the formation of the National Government.

==Government Chief Whip, 1931–1940==
Following the November 1931 general election, he was promoted to the senior position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (Government Chief Whip). Margesson&#x27;s position was in many ways unprecedented, having the task of keeping in power a grouping composed of the Conservatives, National Labour and two groups of Liberals (the official Liberal Party and the Liberal National Party) all behind a single government that sought to stand above partisan politics. With the government commanding the support of 556 MPs, as opposed to just 58 opposition members, his main task was to ensure that the government stayed together and was able to pass contentious legislation without risking a major breach within the government.

That proved tricky several times, as different sections of the National combination came to denounce areas of government policy. Margesson adopted a method of strong disciplinarianism combined with selective use of patronage and the social effect of ostracism to secure every vote possible. An example of his methods was his letter to the House of Commons&#x27; youngest member, the future minister John Profumo, after the Norway Debate, in which Profumo had opposed other Conservatives. Margesson&#x27;s letter included the following extraordinary passage: &quot;And I can tell you this, you utterly contemptible little shit. On every morning that you wake up for the rest of your life you will be ashamed of what you did last night.&quot; On that occasion, his methods failed.

Despite such behaviour, Margesson remained a much-liked individual, with many members expressing personal admiration for him. Away from his duties he was known to be quite sociable, and within the parliamentary party; few bore him ill. However, a major faultline lay over the question of introducing protective tariffs on imports as a prelude to negotiating a customs union within the British Empire. The proposed policy had deeply divided the Conservatives over the previous 30 years, but by then, they, with most of the National Labour and Liberal National members of the government, had become in favour of the policy during the Great Depression.

However the Liberal Party remained committed to the principle of free trade and were deeply reluctant to compromise. Whilst the Liberals themselves barely commanded the support of 33 MPs, they were one of only two parties in the government with a long independent history, and there were fears that their withdrawal would turn the National Government into a mere Conservative rump, something that National Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald wished to avoid.

At one stage, it was agreed that members of the cabinet would suspend the principle of cabinet collective responsibility and agree to differ on tariffs.

Matters were complicated again by the question of Cabinet appointments. When the Liberal President of the Board of Education Sir Donald Maclean died, Margesson insisted that to appoint another Liberal, merely on the basis of party balance, would inflame tensions in Conservative MPs, could lead to a poor appointment and would maintain an imbalance, the Liberals having one more Cabinet minister than the Liberal Nationals did despite the latter having two more MPs. National Labour Lord Privy Seal Lord Snowden was increasingly siding with the Liberals on all key divisions, thus providing a surrogate. The appointment of the Conservative Lord Irwin upset the Liberals, who had no promise that the next Cabinet vacancy would be filled by a Liberal.

In the summer of 1932, the Ottawa Agreement was negotiated between the dominions, and free trade seemed a dead cause within government. In September, the Liberals resigned their ministerial offices but did not withdraw complete support for the government until the following November. However the National Government did not break up, as the remaining National Labour and Liberal National elements remained in government.

In 1933, Margesson was appointed to the Privy Council.

In 1935, the Government came under fire from the Diehard Conservative wing of the Conservative Party over plans to implement the Government of India Act 1935, which would grant India more autonomy. The policy was widely felt to be a hangover from the previous Labour government and one that few Conservative governments would have implemented. Many believed that the plan would not have been pursued except for both a desire to prove the government&#x27;s nonpartisan credentials and Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s determination to implement the policy. For some, the question of the success of the policy became a question of the survival of the National Government. Opponents to Indian Home Rule found several spokespersons, most notably Winston Churchill, and they harried the government at every stage, with nearly one hundred Conservative MPs voting against the third reading of the Bill, the highest number of Conservatives to vote against a three-line whip in the twentieth century. Still, the Bill passed easily.

Margesson was retained as Chief Whip when Baldwin became Prime Minister in June 1935 but had to face further rifts in the party over foreign policy and other matters. The government&#x27;s majority was cut to 250 in the November 1935 general election. In December, the leaking of the proposed Hoare-Laval Plan to grant two-thirds of Abyssinia to Italy outraged some Conservative MPs. Margesson&#x27;s reading of the mood led to the Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare being dropped from the government to soothe feelings and keep the government in power.

The late 1930s were a turbulent time within the National Government, with rebellions over foreign policy, over unemployment, over agriculture and other matters routinely threatened to rock the government. Margesson was instrumental in heading off many of the rebellions and limiting damage caused by others. He was instrumental in warding these off for Baldwin and then Neville Chamberlain. However, a well of discontent with the government&#x27;s foreign policy grew, especially after Britain entered World War II. Eight months into the conflict, severe reverses in the Norwegian campaign led to the two-day &quot;Norway Debate&quot; of 7 and 8 May 1940 in which the government came under severe criticism from its own supporters and witnessed a massive rebellion on a motion of confidence. The government maintained a majority, but Margesson&#x27;s soundings revealed that that majority was imperilled unless the political composition of the government was widened. When Chamberlain realised that he was unable to do so, he resigned and was succeeded by Churchill.

Margesson was referred to in the book &quot;Guilty Men&quot; by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym &quot;Cato&quot;), published in 1940 as an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany.

==Secretary of State for War, 1940–1942==
Many were surprised that Churchill retained Margesson as Chief Whip, little realising that there was no personal animosity between the two and that Churchill would have had less regard for Margesson if he had not carried out his functions as Chief Whip. Margesson proved a useful buttress of support as Churchill consolidated his position in government.

Margesson, who was living at the Carlton Club since his recent divorce, was present when it was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 14 October 1940. He was left homeless and had to sleep for a time on a makeshift bed in the underground Cabinet Annexe.

When, at the end of 1940, the position of Secretary of State for War fell vacant, Margesson was promoted to it. Margesson proved competent and efficient, but in February 1942, Britain suffered severe military setbacks, including the loss of Singapore. Churchill was forced to make changes to his ministerial team and find scapegoats for the disasters. Margesson was dropped and replaced by his own Permanent Under-Secretary P. J. Grigg, an unprecedented move. Margesson was first told of the change by Grigg himself but accepted his fate as necessary for the government&#x27;s future. Later that year, he was made Viscount Margesson, of Rugby in the County of Warwick. His political influence waned sharply. He subsequently worked in the City of London.

==Family==
Margesson married Frances, the half-sister of Alberta Montagu, Countess of Sandwich and daughter of Francis Howard Leggett and Betty Leggett, in 1916. They had one son and two daughters but were divorced in 1940. Their second daughter, the Hon. Mary, married Lord Charteris of Amisfield. Lord Margesson died in the Bahamas in December 1965, aged 75, and was succeeded in the viscountcy by his only son, Francis.

<text>The Brauerei zur Malzmühle (&quot;Brewery at the Malt Mill&quot;) is a Kölsch brewery located in Cologne, Germany. The brewery was founded in 1858 by Hubert Koch as the &quot;Bier und Malzextrakt Dampfbrauerei Koch, Cöln&quot; (&quot;Beer and Malt Extract Steam Brewery, Cologne&quot;) located at the &quot;Heumarkt&quot; in Cologne. In 1912, the brewery was taken over by the brewer Gottfried Joseph Schwartz, who gave the brewery its current name.

The brewery&#x27;s main product is &quot;Mühlen-Kölsch&quot;, a traditional top-fermented style of beer local to the city.

<doc id="1135719" wikidata="Q291031" url="?curid=1135719" title="Allgemeine SS">
<text>The Allgemeine SS (; &quot;General SS&quot;) was a major branch of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany; it was managed by the SS Main Office (&quot;SS-Hauptamt&quot;). The &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; was officially established in the autumn of 1934 to distinguish its members from the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS Dispositional Troops or SS-VT), which later became the Waffen-SS, and the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS Death&#x27;s Head Units or SS-TV), which were in charge of the Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps. SS formations committed many war crimes against civilians and allied servicemen.

Starting in 1939, foreign units of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; were raised in occupied countries. From 1940 they were consolidated into the Directorate of the Germanic-SS (&quot;Leitstelle der germanischen SS&quot;). When the war first began, the vast majority of SS members belonged to the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, but this proportion changed during the later years of the war after the Waffen-SS opened up membership to ethnic Germans and non-Germans.

==Early years==
Adolf Hitler in 1925 ordered Julius Schreck to organise the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; (&quot;Protection Command&quot;). Hitler wanted a small group of tough ex-soldiers like Schreck, who would be loyal to him. The unit included old &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; members like Emil Maurice and Erhard Heiden. The unit made its first public appearance on 4 April 1925. That same year, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; was expanded to a national level. It was also successively renamed the &quot;Sturmstaffel&quot; (&quot;Storm Squadron&quot;) and then finally the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (&quot;Protection Squadron&quot;; SS) on 9 November 1925. The SS was subordinated to the SA and thus a subunit of the SA and the NSDAP. It was considered to be an elite organization by both party members and the general population.

The main task of the SS was the personal protection of the Führer of the Nazi Party, Adolf Hitler. In 1925 the SS had only 200 active members and in 1926, it ended the year with the same number. There were 280 members in 1928 as the SS continued to struggle under the SA. After Heinrich Himmler took over the SS in January 1929, he worked to separate the SS from the SA. By December 1929, the number of SS members had grown to 1,000. Himmler began to systematically develop and expand the SS with stricter requirements for members as well as a general purge of SS members who were identified as drunkards, criminals, or otherwise undesirable for service in the SS. Himmler&#x27;s ultimate aim was to turn the SS into the most powerful organization in Germany and most influential branch of the party. By 1930 Himmler had persuaded Hitler to run the SS as a separate organisation, although it was officially still subordinate to the SA.

==Formation and service==
After the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; (seizure of power) by the NSDAP in January 1933, the SS began to expand into a massive organization. By the end of 1932 it included over 52,000 members. By December 1933 the SS increased to 204,000 members and Himmler ordered a temporary freeze on recruitment.

On 20 April 1934, Göring and Himmler agreed to put aside their differences, largely because of their mutual hatred of the SA. Göring transferred control of the Gestapo to Himmler, who was also named chief of all German police forces outside Prussia. Two days later Himmler named Reinhard Heydrich the head of the Gestapo. The SS was further cemented when both it and the Gestapo participated in the destruction of the SA leadership during the Night of the Long Knives from 30 June to 2 July 1934. They either killed or arrested every major SA leader, above all Ernst Röhm.

Himmler was later named the chief of all German police in June 1936, and the Gestapo was incorporated with the Kripo (Criminal Police) into sub-branches of the SiPo. Heydrich was made head of the SiPo and continued as chief of the SD.

In August 1934, Himmler received permission from Hitler to form a new organisation from the &quot;SS Sonderkommandos&quot; and the &quot;Politischen Bereitschaften&quot;, the &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT). This was a paramilitary force, which in war was to be subordinate to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (&quot;Armed Forces&quot;), but remained under Himmler&#x27;s control in times of peace and under Hitler&#x27;s personal control regardless. According to this restructure, the SS now housed three different subordinate commands:

# &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;
# &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppe&quot; (SS-VT)
# &quot;SS-Wachverbände&quot;, known as the SS-&quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV) from 29 March 1936, forward

Himmler further conducted additional purges of the SS to exclude those deemed to be opportunists, alcoholics, homosexuals, or of uncertain racial status. This &quot;house cleaning&quot; removed some 60,000 SS members by December 1935. By 1939, the SS had risen again and reached its peak with an estimated 240,000 members.

By the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the SS had solidified into its final form. Correspondingly, the term &quot;SS&quot; could be applied to three separate organizations, mainly the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; and the Waffen-SS, which until July 1940 was officially known as the SS-VT. When the war first began, the vast majority of SS members belonged to the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, but this statistic changed during the later stages of the war when the Waffen-SS opened up membership for non-Germans. Further, with Himmler as Chief of the German Police, the SS also controlled the uniformed &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police).

==Hierarchy and structure==

The term &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; referred to the &quot;General SS,&quot; meaning those units of the SS considered &quot;main, regular, or standard.&quot; By 1938, the Allgemeine SS was administratively divided into several main sections:

* Full-time officers and members of the main SS departments
* Part-time volunteer members of SS regional units
* SS security forces, e.g., the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo – Gestapo &amp; Kripo) and &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD)
* Concentration Camp staffs of the &quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot;
* Reserve, honorary or otherwise inactive SS members

After World War II began, the lines between the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; and the Waffen-SS became increasingly blurred, due largely to the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; headquarters offices having administrative and supply command over the Waffen-SS. By 1940, all of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; had been issued grey war-time uniforms. Himmler ordered that the all-black uniforms be turned in for use by others. They were sent east where they were used by auxiliary police units and west to be used by Germanic-SS units such as the ones in the Netherlands and Denmark.

===Full time SS personnel===

Approximately one third of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; were considered &quot;full time&quot; meaning that they received a salary as government employees, were employed full-time in an SS office, and performed SS duties as their primary occupation. The vast majority of such full-time SS personnel were assigned to the main SS offices that were considered part of the Allgemeine SS. By 1942, these main offices managed all activities of the SS and were divided as follows:

*&quot;Hauptamt Persönlicher Stab Reichsführer-SS&quot; (Main Office Personal Staff Reichsführer-SS; HaPerStab)
*&quot;SS-Hauptamt&quot; (SS Main Office; SS-HA)
*&quot;SS-Führungshauptamt&quot; (SS Leadership Main Office; SS-FHA)
*&quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; (Reich Security Main Office; RSHA)
*&quot;SS-Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt&quot; (SS Main Economic and Administrative Office; SS-WVHA)
*&quot;Ordnungspolizei Hauptamt&quot; (Order Police Main Office)
*&quot;Hauptamt SS-Gericht&quot; (SS Court Main Office; HA SS-Gericht)
*&quot;SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt&quot; (SS Race and Settlement Main Office; RuSHA)
*&quot;SS Personalhauptamt|SS-Personalhauptamt&quot; (SS Personnel Main Office; SS PHA)
*&quot;Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle&quot; (Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans; VoMi)
*&quot;SS-Schulungsamt&quot; (SS Education Office)
*&quot;Reichskommissar für die Festigung deutschen Volkstums; RKFDV&quot; (Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood; RKF or RKFDV)

Main office commanders and staff were exempt from military conscription, although many, such as Heydrich, served as reservists in the regular German military. Main office members did join the Waffen-SS, where they could accept a lower rank and serve in active combat or be listed as inactive reservists. By 1944, with Germany&#x27;s looming defeat, the draft exemption for the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; main offices was lifted and many junior members were ordered into combat with senior members assuming duties as Waffen-SS generals.

===SS regional units===
The core of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; was part-time mustering formations spread throughout Germany. Members in these regional units would typically meet once a week in uniform, as well as participate in various Nazi Party functions. Activities including drill and ideological instruction, marching in parades, and providing security at various Nazi party rallies.

Regional SS units were organized into commands known as &quot;SS-Oberabschnitt&quot; meaning &quot;SS-Senior Sector&quot; responsible for commanding a (region), which were subordinate to the SS-HA; &quot;SS-Abschnitt&quot; (SS-Sector) was the next lower level of command, responsible for administering a (District); &quot;Standarten&quot; (regiment), which were the basic units of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;. Before 1934, SS personnel received no pay and their work was completely voluntary. After 1933, the &quot;Oberabschnitt&quot; commanders and their staff became regarded as &quot;full time&quot; but the rank and file of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; were still part-time only. Regular &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; personnel were also not exempt from conscription and many were called up to serve in the Wehrmacht.

===Security forces===
In 1936, the state security police forces of the Gestapo and Kripo (Criminal Police) were consolidated. The combined forces were folded into the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo) and placed under the central command of Reinhard Heydrich, already chief of the party &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD). Later from 27 September 1939 forward, the SD, Gestapo, and Kripo were folded into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) that was placed under Heydrich&#x27;s control. As a functioning state agency, the SiPo ceased to exist. The ordinary uniformed German police, known as the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Orpo), were under SS control after 1936 but were never incorporated into the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;; although many police members were also dual SS members.

The death squad units of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were formed under the direction of Heydrich and operated by the SS before and during World War II. In September 1939, they operated in territories occupied by the German armed forces following the invasion of Poland. Men for the units were drawn from the SS, the SD, and the police. Originally part of the SiPo, in late September 1939 the operational control of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; was taken over by the RSHA. When the killing units were re-formed prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the men of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were drawn from the SD, Gestapo, Kripo, Orpo, civilian (SS auxiliary) and Waffen-SS. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; units perpetrated atrocities in the occupied Soviet Union, including mass murder of Jews, communists, prisoners of war, and hostages, and played a key role in the Holocaust.

===Concentration camp personnel===
All Concentration Camp staff were originally part of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; under the office of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate (&quot;Inspektion der Konzentrationslager&quot; or IKL). First headed by Theodor Eicke, the Concentration Camp personnel were formed into the &quot;SS-Wachverbände&quot; in 1933, which later became known as the SS-&quot;Totenkopfverbände&quot; (SS-TV). Thereafter, the SS-TV branch increasingly became divided into the camp service proper and the military &quot;Totenkopf&quot; formation controlled by the SS-VT (forerunner of the Waffen-SS).
As the Nazi regime became more oppressive and World War II escalated, the concentration camp system grew in size, lethal operation, and scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified. Intensification of the killing operations took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; for mass killings.

Victims at these new extermination camps were killed with the use of carbon monoxide gas from automobile engines. During Operation Reinhard, three death camps were built in occupied Poland: Bełżec (operational by March 1942), Sobibór (operational by May 1942), and Treblinka (operational by July 1942). On Himmler&#x27;s orders, by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.

After 1942, the entire camp service was placed under the authority of the Waffen-SS for a variety of administrative and logistical reasons. The ultimate command authority for the camp system during World War II was the &quot;SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt&quot; (WHVA) under Oswald Pohl. Beside the camp operations, the WHVA was the organization responsible for managing the finances, supply systems and business projects for the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;. By 1944, with the concentration camps fully integrated with the Waffen-SS and under the control of the WVHA, a standard practice developed to rotate SS members in and out of the camps, based on manpower needs and also to give assignments to wounded Waffen-SS officers and soldiers who could no longer serve in front-line combat. This rotation of personnel is the main argument that nearly the entire SS knew of the concentration camps, and what actions were committed within them, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

===Other units===
By late 1940 the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; controlled the Germanic SS (&quot;Germanische SS&quot;), which were collaborationist organizations modeled after the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; in several Western European countries. Their purpose was to enforce Nazi racial doctrine, especially anti-Semitic ideals. They typically served as local security police augmenting German units of the Gestapo, SD, and other main departments of the Reich Main Security Office.

The &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; also consisted of the &quot;SS-Frauenkorps&quot; (literally, &quot;Women&#x27;s Corps&quot;) which was an auxiliary reporting and clerical unit, which included the &quot;SS-Helferinnenkorps&quot; (Women Helper Corps), made up of female volunteers. Members were assigned as administrative staff and supply personnel, and served in command positions and as guards at women&#x27;s concentration camps in places such as Ravensbrück concentration camp. Like their male equivalents in the SS, females participated in atrocities against Jews, Poles, and others.

In 1942, Himmler set up the &quot;Reichsschule für SS Helferinnen&quot; (Reich school for SS helpers) in Oberehnheim to train women in communications so that they could free up men for combat roles. Himmler also intended to replace all female civilian employees in his service with &quot;SS-Helferinnen&quot; members, as they were selected and trained according to NSDAP ideology. The school was closed on 22 November 1944 due to the Allied advance.

===Ranks===
The ranks of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; and the Waffen-SS were based upon those of the SA and used the same titles. However, there was a distinctly separate hierarchical subdivision of the larger Waffen-SS from its general-SS counterpart and an SS member could in fact hold two separate SS ranks. For instance, in 1940 Hermann Fegelein held the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; rank of a &quot;Standartenführer&quot; (full colonel), yet was only ranked an &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (lieutenant colonel) in the Waffen-SS. If this same SS member were an architectural engineer, then the &quot;SS-Hauptamt&quot; would issue a third rank of &quot;SS-Sonderführer&quot;.

SS members could also hold reserve commissions in the regular military as well as a Nazi Party political rank. Add to this that many senior SS members were also employees of the Reich government in capacities as ministers, deputies, etc. In 1944, nearly every SS general was granted equivalent Waffen-SS rank, without regard to previous military service. This was ordered so to give SS-generals authority over military units and POW camps and apparently to try to provide potential protection under the Hague Convention rules of warfare. In the event of capture by the Allies, SS-Generals thereby hoped they would be given status as military prisoners rather than captured police officials.

==Social background of SS-Officers==
==Total manpower==
In 1944, the stated membership estimate for the SS was 800,000. The Waffen-SS had approximately 600,000 of those members in their ranks. The Waffen-SS had grown from three regiments to over 38 divisions during World War II, and served alongside the &quot;Heer&quot; (regular army), but never formally a part of it. In comparison, by the end of the war the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; only had a little over 40,000 men still in its ranks.

===Order of battle===
The mustering formations of part-time SS members, considered before 1938 to be the core of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, were maintained in their own order of battle, beginning with regiment sized &quot;Standarten&quot; units and extending upwards to division strength &quot;Oberabschnitte&quot; commands. Within the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; &quot;Standarten&quot; there were in turn subordinate battalions of &quot;Sturmbann&quot; themselves divided into company &quot;Sturme&quot;.

For most rank and file members of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;, the &quot;Sturm&quot; level was the highest which the ordinary SS member would typically associate with. The &quot;Sturm&quot; itself was further divided into platoon sized &quot;Truppen&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;Zug&quot;) which were in turn divided into squad sized &quot;Scharen&quot;. For larger &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; commands, the &quot;Scharen&quot; would be further divided into &quot;Rotte&quot; which were the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot; equivalent of a fire team.

Himmler had grand visions for the SS and authorized SS and Police Bases (&quot;SS- und Polizeistützpunkte&quot;) to be established in occupied Poland and occupied areas of the Soviet Union. They were to be &quot;armed industrialized agricultural complexes&quot;. They would also maintain order in the areas they were established. They did not go beyond the planning stage.

<text>The fall of Saigon was the capture of Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, by North Vietnam on 30 April 1975. This decisive event led to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government and the evacuation of thousands of U.S. personnel and South Vietnamese civilians, and marked the end of the Vietnam War. The aftermath ushered in a transition period under North Vietnamese control, culminating in the formal reunification of the country as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam under communist rule on 2 July 1976.

The People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC), under the command of General Văn Tiến Dũng, began their final attack on Saigon on 29 April 1975, with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces commanded by General Nguyễn Văn Toàn suffering a heavy artillery bombardment. By the afternoon of the next day, the PAVN/VC had occupied the important points of the city and raised their flag over the South Vietnamese presidential palace.

The capture of the city was preceded by Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of almost all American civilian and military personnel in Saigon, along with tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians who had been associated with the Republic of Vietnam. A few Americans chose not to be evacuated. United States ground combat units had left South Vietnam more than two years prior to the fall of Saigon and were not available to assist with either the defense of Saigon or the evacuation. The evacuation was the largest helicopter evacuation in history. In addition to the flight of refugees, the end of the war and the institution of new rules by the communist government contributed to a decline in the city&#x27;s population until 1979, after which the population increased again.

On 2 July 1976, the National Assembly of the unified Vietnam renamed Saigon in honor of Hồ Chí Minh, the late Chairman of the Workers&#x27; Party of Vietnam and founder of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam).

==Names==
Various names have been applied to these events. The Vietnamese government officially calls it the &quot;Day of the Liberation of the South and National Reunification&quot; () or &quot;Liberation Day&quot; (), while the term &quot;fall of Saigon&quot; is commonly used in Western accounts. It is alternatively called the &quot;Day the Country Was Lost&quot; (), &quot;Black April&quot; (), &quot;National Day of Shame&quot; () or &quot;National Day of Resentment&quot; () by many overseas Vietnamese who were refugees from the former South Vietnam. It is also known by the neutral name &quot;April 30, 1975 incident&quot; () or simply &quot;April 30&quot; ().

== North Vietnamese advance ==
The rapidity with which the South Vietnamese position collapsed in 1975 was surprising to most American and South Vietnamese observers, and probably to the North Vietnamese and their allies as well. A memo prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and U.S. Army Intelligence, published on 5 March, indicated that South Vietnam could hold out through the current dry season—i.e., at least until 1976. These predictions proved to be grievously in error. Even as that memo was being released, Dũng was preparing a major offensive in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, which began on 10 March and led to the capture of Buôn Ma Thuột. The ARVN began a disorderly and costly retreat, hoping to redeploy its forces and hold the southern part of South Vietnam, south of the 13th parallel.

Supported by artillery and armor, the PAVN continued to march towards Saigon, capturing the major cities of northern South Vietnam at the end of March—Huế on the 25th and Đà Nẵng on the 28th. Along the way, disorderly South Vietnamese retreats and the flight of refugees—there were more than 300,000 in Đà Nẵng—damaged South Vietnamese prospects for a turnaround. After the loss of Đà Nẵng, those prospects had already been dismissed as nonexistent by CIA officers in Vietnam, who believed that nothing short of B-52 strikes against Hanoi could possibly stop the North Vietnamese.

By 8 April, the North Vietnamese Politburo, which in March had recommended caution to Dũng, cabled him to demand &quot;unremitting vigor in the attack all the way to the heart of Saigon.&quot; On 14 April, they renamed the campaign the &quot;Hồ Chí Minh campaign&quot;, after revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh, in hopes of wrapping it up before his birthday on 19 May. Meanwhile, South Vietnam failed to garner any significant increase in military aid from the United States, snuffing out President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu&#x27;s hopes for renewed American support.

On 9 April, PAVN forces reached Xuân Lộc, the last line of defense before Saigon, where the ARVN 18th Division made a last stand and held the city through fierce fighting for 11 days. The ARVN finally withdrew from Xuân Lộc on 20 April having inflicted heavy losses on the PAVN, and President Thiệu resigned on 21 April in a tearful televised announcement in which he denounced the United States for failing to come to the aid of the South. The North Vietnamese front line was now just from downtown Saigon. The victory at Xuân Lộc, which had drawn many South Vietnamese troops away from the Mekong Delta area, opened the way for PAVN to encircle Saigon, and they soon did so, moving 100,000 troops in position around the city by 27 April. With the ARVN having few defenders, the fate of the city was effectively sealed.

The ARVN III Corps commander, General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, had organized five centers of resistance to defend the city. These fronts were so connected as to form an arc enveloping the entire area west, north, and east of the capital. The Cu Chi front, to the northwest, was defended by the 25th Division; the Binh Duong front, to the north, was the responsibility of the 5th Division; the Bien Hoa front, to the northeast, was defended by the 18th Division; the Vung Tau and 15 Route front, to the southeast, were held by the 1st Airborne Brigade and one battalion of the 3rd Division; and the Long An front, for which the Capital Military District Command was responsible, was defended by elements of the re-formed 22nd Division. South Vietnamese defensive forces around Saigon totalled approximately 60,000 troops. However, as the exodus made it into Saigon, along with them were many ARVN soldiers, which swelled the &quot;men under arms&quot; in the city to over 250,000. These units were mostly battered and leaderless, which threw the city into further anarchy.

==Evacuation==
The rapid PAVN advances of March and early April led to increased concern in Saigon that the city, which had been fairly peaceful throughout the war and whose people had endured relatively little suffering, was soon to come under direct attack. Many feared that once the communists took control of the city, a bloodbath of reprisals would take place. In 1968, PAVN and VC forces had occupied Huế for close to a month. After they were ejected, American and ARVN forces had found mass graves. A study indicated that the VC had targeted ARVN officers, Catholics, intellectuals, businessmen, and other suspected counterrevolutionaries. More recently, eight Americans captured in Buôn Ma Thuột had vanished and reports of beheadings and other executions were filtering through from Huế and Đà Nẵng, mostly spurred on by government propaganda. Most Americans and citizens of other countries allied to the United States wanted to evacuate the city before it fell, and many South Vietnamese, especially those associated with the United States or South Vietnamese government, wanted to leave as well.

As early as the end of March, some Americans were leaving the city. Flights out of Saigon, lightly booked under ordinary circumstances, were full. Throughout April the speed of the evacuation increased, as the Defense Attaché Office (DAO) began to fly out nonessential personnel. Many Americans attached to the DAO refused to leave without their Vietnamese friends and dependents, who included common-law wives and children. It was illegal for the DAO to move these people to American soil, and this initially slowed down the rate of departure, but eventually the DAO began illegally flying undocumented Vietnamese to Clark Air Base in the Philippines.

On 3 April, President Gerald Ford announced &quot;Operation Babylift&quot;, which would evacuate about 2,000 orphans from the country. One of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy planes involved in the operation crashed, killing 155 passengers and crew and seriously reducing the morale of the American staff. In addition to the over 2,500 orphans evacuated by Babylift, Operation New Life resulted in the evacuation of over 110,000 Vietnamese refugees. The final evacuation was Operation Frequent Wind which resulted in 7,000 people being evacuated from Saigon by helicopter.

===Ford administration&#x27;s plans for the final evacuation===
By this time, the Ford administration had also begun planning a complete evacuation of the American presence. The planning was complicated by practical, legal, and strategic concerns. The administration was divided on how swift the evacuations should be. The Pentagon sought to evacuate as fast as possible, to avoid the risk of casualties or other accidents. The U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, Graham Martin, was technically the field commander for any evacuation since evacuations are part of the purview of the State Department. Martin drew the ire of many in the Pentagon by wishing to keep the evacuation process as quiet and orderly as possible. His desire for this was to prevent total chaos and to deflect the real possibility of South Vietnamese turning against Americans and to keep all-out bloodshed from occurring.

Ford approved a plan between the extremes in which all but 1,250 Americans—few enough to be removed in a single day&#x27;s helicopter airlift—would be evacuated quickly; the remaining 1,250 would only leave when the airport was threatened. In the meantime, as many Vietnamese refugees as possible would be flown out.

American evacuation planning was set against the Ford administration&#x27;s other policies. Ford still hoped that he would be able to gain additional military aid for South Vietnam. Throughout April, he attempted to get Congress behind a proposed appropriation of $722 million, which might cover the cost of the reconstitution of some of the South Vietnamese forces that had been destroyed. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was opposed to a full-scale evacuation as long as the aid option remained on the table because the removal of American forces would signal a loss of faith in Thiệu and severely weaken him.

There was also a concern in the administration over whether the use of military forces to support and carry out the evacuation was permitted under the newly passed War Powers Act. Eventually, White House lawyers determined that the use of American forces to rescue citizens in an emergency was unlikely to run afoul of the law, but the legality of using military assets to withdraw refugees was unknown.

===Refugees===
While American citizens were generally assured of a simple way to leave the country just by showing up to an evacuation point, South Vietnamese who wanted to leave Saigon before it fell often resorted to independent arrangements. The under-the-table payments required to gain a passport and exit visa jumped sixfold, and the price of seagoing vessels tripled. Those who owned property in the city were often forced to sell it at a substantial loss or abandon it altogether; the asking price of one particularly impressive house was cut 75 percent within a two-week period. American visas were of enormous value, and Vietnamese seeking American sponsors posted advertisements in newspapers. One such ad read: &quot;Seeking adoptive parents. Poor diligent students&quot; followed by names, birthdates, and identity card numbers. A disproportionate fraction of Vietnamese in the 1975 wave of emigration who later achieved refugee status in the United States were former members of the South Vietnamese government and military. Though most expected to find political and personal freedom in the United States on account of their anti-Communist bonafides, they often encountered an unexpected and complex resettlement process, involving stays in U.S. military-operated processing centers for varying lengths of time before they could begin their new lives in America.

==Political movements and attempts to effect a negotiated solution==
As the North Vietnamese chipped away at more and more of South Vietnam&#x27;s territory, internal opposition to Thiệu continued to accumulate. For instance, in early April, the Senate unanimously voted through a call for new leadership, and some top military commanders were pressing for a coup. In response to this pressure, Thiệu made some changes in his cabinet, and Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm resigned. This did little to reduce the opposition to Thiệu. On 8 April, a South Vietnamese pilot and secret communist, Nguyễn Thành Trung, bombed the Independence Palace and then flew to a PAVN-controlled airstrip; Thiệu was not hurt.

Many in the American mission—Martin in particular—along with some key figures in Washington, believed that negotiations with the communists were still possible, especially if Saigon could stabilize the military situation. Martin&#x27;s hope was that North Vietnam&#x27;s leaders would be willing to allow a &quot;phased withdrawal&quot; whereby a gradual departure might be achieved to allow helpful locals and all Americans to leave (along with full military withdrawal) over a period of months.

Opinions were divided on whether any government which would be headed by Thiệu could effect such a political solution. The foreign minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) had indicated, on 2 April, that the PRG might negotiate with a Saigon government that did not include Thiệu. Thus, even among Thiệu&#x27;s supporters, pressure was growing for his ouster.

Thiệu resigned on 21 April. His remarks were particularly hard on the Americans, first for forcing South Vietnam to accede to the Paris Peace Accords, second for failing to support South Vietnam afterwards, and all the while asking South Vietnam &quot;to do an impossible thing, like filling up the oceans with stones.&quot; The presidency was turned over to Vice President Trần Văn Hương. The view of the North Vietnamese government, broadcast by Radio Hanoi, was that the new regime was merely &quot;another puppet regime.&quot;

==Last days==
:&quot;All times given are Saigon time.&quot;

===PAVN&#x27;s encirclement===

On 27 April, Saigon was hit by PAVN rockets—the first in more than 40 months.

With his overtures to the North rebuffed out of hand, Tran resigned on 28 April and was succeeded by General Duong Van Minh. Minh took over a regime that was by this time in a state of utter collapse. He had longstanding ties with the Communists, and it was hoped he could negotiate a ceasefire; however, Hanoi was in no mood to negotiate. On 28 April, PAVN forces fought their way into the outskirts of the city. At the Newport Bridge (), about five kilometres (three miles) from the city centre, the VC seized the Thảo Điền area at the eastern end of the bridge and attempted to seize the bridge but were repulsed by the ARVN 12th Airborne Battalion. As Bien Hoa was falling, Toan fled to Saigon, informing the government that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat.

At 18:06 on 28 April, as Minh finished his acceptance speech three A-37 Dragonflies piloted by former Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) pilots, who had defected to the Vietnamese People&#x27;s Air Force at the fall of Da Nang, dropped six Mk81 250 lb bombs on Tan Son Nhut Air Base damaging aircraft. RVNAF F-5s took off in pursuit, but they were unable to intercept the A-37s. C-130s leaving Tan Son Nhut reported receiving PAVN .51 cal and 37 mm anti-aircraft (AAA) fire while sporadic PAVN rocket and artillery attacks also started to hit the airport and air base. C-130 flights were stopped temporarily after the air attack but resumed at 20:00 on 28 April.

At 03:58 on 29 April, C-130E, #72-1297, flown by a crew from the 776th Tactical Airlift Squadron, was destroyed by a 122 mm rocket while taxiing to pick up refugees after offloading a BLU-82 at the base. The crew evacuated the burning aircraft on the taxiway and departed the airfield on another C-130 that had previously landed. This was the last USAF fixed-wing aircraft to leave Tan Son Nhat.

At dawn on 29 April the RVNAF began to haphazardly depart Tan Son Nhut Air Base as A-37s, F-5s, C-7s, C-119s and C-130s departed for Thailand while UH-1s took off in search of the ships of Task Force 76. Some RVNAF aircraft stayed to continue to fight the advancing PAVN. One AC-119 gunship had spent the night of 28/29 April dropping flares and firing on the approaching PAVN. At dawn on 29 April, two A-1 Skyraiders began patrolling the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut at until one was shot down, presumably by an SA-7 missile. At 07:00 the AC-119 was firing on PAVN to the east of Tan Son Nhut when it too was hit by an SA-7 and fell in flames to the ground.

At 06:00 on 29 April, Dũng was ordered by the Politburo to &quot;strike with the greatest determination straight into the enemy&#x27;s final lair.&quot; After one day of bombardment and general offensive, the PAVN were ready to make their final push into the city.

At 08:00 on 29 April Lieutenant General Trần Văn Minh, commander of the RVNAF and 30 of his staff arrived at the DAO Compound demanding evacuation, signifying the complete loss of RVNAF command and control.

===Operation Frequent Wind===

The continuing rocket fire and debris on the runways at Tan Son Nhut caused General Homer D. Smith, the U.S. defense attaché in Saigon, to advise Martin that the runways were unfit for use and that the emergency evacuation of Saigon would need to be completed by helicopter. Originally, Martin had intended to effect the evacuation by use of fixed-wing aircraft from the base. This plan was altered at a critical time when a South Vietnamese pilot decided to defect, and jettisoned his ordnance along the only runways still in use (which had not yet been destroyed by shelling).

Under pressure from Kissinger, Martin forced Marine guards to take him to Tan Son Nhat in the midst of continued shelling, so he might personally assess the situation. After seeing that fixed-wing departures were not an option (a decision Martin did not want to make without firsthand knowledge of the situation on the ground, in case the helicopter lift failed), Martin gave the green light for the helicopter evacuation to begin in earnest.

Reports came in from the outskirts of the city that the PAVN were closing in. At 10:48, Martin relayed to Kissinger his desire to activate Operation Frequent Wind, the helicopter evacuation of U.S. personnel and at-risk Vietnamese. At 10:51 on 29 April, the order was given by CINCPAC to commence Operation Frequent Wind. The American radio station began regular play of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;, the signal for American personnel to move immediately to the evacuation points.

Under this plan, CH-53 and CH-46 helicopters were used to evacuate Americans and friendly Vietnamese to ships, including the Seventh Fleet, in the South China Sea. The main evacuation point was the DAO Compound at Tan Son Nhat; buses moved through the city picking up passengers and driving them out to the airport, with the first buses arriving at Tan Son Nhat shortly after noon. The first CH-53 landed at the DAO compound in the afternoon, and by the evening, 395 Americans and more than 4,000 Vietnamese had been evacuated. By 23:00 the U.S. Marines who were providing security were withdrawing and arranging the demolition of the DAO office, American equipment, files, and cash. Air America UH-1s also participated in the evacuation.

The original evacuation plans had not called for a large-scale helicopter operation at the United States Embassy, Saigon. Helicopters and buses were to shuttle people from the embassy to the DAO Compound. However, in the course of the evacuation it turned out that a few thousand people were stranded at the embassy, including many Vietnamese. Additional Vietnamese civilians gathered outside the embassy and scaled the walls, hoping to claim refugee status. Thunderstorms increased the difficulty of helicopter operations. Nevertheless, the evacuation from the embassy continued more or less unbroken throughout the evening and night.

At 03:45 on the morning of 30 April, Kissinger and Ford ordered Martin to evacuate only Americans from that point forward. Reluctantly, Martin announced that only Americans were to be flown out, due to worries that the North Vietnamese would soon take the city and the Ford administration&#x27;s desire to announce the completion of the American evacuation. Martin was ordered by Ford to board the evacuation helicopter. The call sign of that helicopter was &quot;Lady Ace 09&quot;, and the pilot carried direct orders from Ford for Martin to be on board. The pilot, Gerry Berry, had the orders written in grease-pencil on his kneepads. Martin&#x27;s wife, Dorothy, had already been evacuated by previous flights, and left behind her suitcase so a South Vietnamese woman might be able to squeeze on board with her.

&quot;Lady Ace 09&quot; from USMC squadron HMM-165 and piloted by Berry, took off at 04:58—though he didn&#x27;t know it, had Martin refused to leave, the Marines had a reserve order to arrest him and carry him away to ensure his safety. The embassy evacuation had flown out 978 Americans and about 1,100 Vietnamese. The Marines who had been securing the embassy followed at dawn, with the last aircraft leaving at 07:53. 420 Vietnamese and South Koreans were left behind in the embassy compound, with an additional crowd gathered outside the walls.

The Americans and the refugees they flew out were generally allowed to leave without intervention from either the North or South Vietnamese. Pilots of helicopters heading to Tan Son Nhat were aware that PAVN anti-aircraft guns were tracking them, but they refrained from firing. The Hanoi leadership, reckoning that completion of the evacuation would lessen the risk of American intervention, had instructed Dũng not to target the airlift itself. Meanwhile, members of the police in Saigon had been promised evacuation in exchange for protecting the American evacuation buses and control of the crowds in the city during the evacuation.

Although this was the end of the American military operation, Vietnamese continued to leave the country by boat and, where possible, by aircraft. RVNAF pilots who had access to helicopters flew them offshore to the American fleet, where they were able to land. Many RVNAF helicopters were dumped into the ocean to make room on the decks for more aircraft. RVNAF fighters and other planes also sought refuge in Thailand while two O-1s landed on .

Martin was flown out to the , where he pleaded for helicopters to return to the embassy compound to pick up the few hundred remaining hopefuls waiting to be evacuated. 

Many Vietnamese nationals who were evacuated were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act.

Decades later, when the U.S. government reestablished diplomatic relations with Vietnam, the former embassy building was returned to the United States. The historic staircase that led to the rooftop helicopter pad in the nearby apartment building used by the CIA and other U.S. government employees was salvaged and is on permanent display at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

===Final assault ===
In the early hours of 30 April, Dũng received orders from the Politburo to attack. He then ordered his field commanders to advance directly to key facilities and strategic points in the city. The first PAVN unit to enter the city was the 324th Division. By now, the government had not made any sort of appeals to the people for donations of blood, food, etc.

On the morning of 30 April, PAVN sappers attempted to seize the Newport Bridge but were repulsed by the ARVN Airborne. At 09:00 the PAVN tank column approached the bridge and came under fire from ARVN tanks which destroyed the lead T-54, killing the PAVN Battalion commander.

The ARVN 3rd Task Force, 81st Ranger Group commanded by Major Pham Chau Tai defended Tan Son Nhut and they were joined by the remnants of the Loi Ho unit. At 07:15 on 30 April, the PAVN 24th Regiment approached the Bay Hien intersection () 1.5 km from the main gate of Tan Son Nhat Air Base. The lead T-54 was hit by M67 recoilless rifle and then the next T-54 was hit by a shell from an M48 tank. The PAVN infantry moved forward and engaged the ARVN in house to house fighting forcing them to withdraw to the base by 08:45. The PAVN then sent three tanks and an infantry battalion to assault the main gate and they were met by intensive anti-tank and machine gun fire knocking out the three tanks and killing at least twenty PAVN soldiers. The PAVN tried to bring forward an 85 mm antiaircraft gun but the ARVN knocked it out before it could start firing. The PAVN 10th Division ordered eight more tanks and another infantry battalion to join the attack, but as they approached the Bay Hien intersection they were hit by an airstrike from RVNAF jets operating from Binh Thuy Air Base which destroyed two T-54s. The six surviving tanks arrived at the main gate at 10:00 and began their attack, with two being knocked out by antitank fire in front of the gate and another destroyed as it attempted a flanking manoeuvre. Also on 30 April 1975 as the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Corps deep penetration unit advanced towards Saigon, soldiers at Thủ Đức Military Academy engaged the PAVN armored column on Route 15. Several tanks were detached to deal with the resistance and one was destroyed before the soldiers at the academy surrendered.

At 9:30, Minh announced an unconditional surrender. He ordered all ARVN troops &quot;to cease hostilities in calm and to stay where they are&quot;, while inviting the Provisional Revolutionary Government to engage in &quot;a ceremony of orderly transfer of power so as to avoid any unnecessary bloodshed in the population&quot;.

At approximately 10:30 Pham at Tan Son Nhut Air Base heard of the surrender broadcast and went to the Joint General Staff Compound to seek instructions. He called Minh who told him to prepare to surrender. Pham reportedly told Minh, &quot;If Viet Cong tanks are entering Independence Palace we will come down there to rescue you, sir.&quot; Minh refused Pham&#x27;s suggestion and Pham then told his men to withdraw from the base gates. At 11:30 the PAVN entered the base.

At Newport Bridge the ARVN and PAVN continued to exchange tank and artillery fire until the ARVN commander received Minh&#x27;s capitulation order over the radio. While the bridge was rigged with approximately of demolition charges, the ARVN stood down and at 10:30 the PAVN column crossed the bridge.

=== Capitulation and final surrender announcement ===

PAVN 203rd Tank Brigade (from 2nd Corps of Major general Nguyễn Hữu An) under the command of Commander Nguyễn Tất Tài and Political Commissar Bùi Văn Tùng was the first unit to burst through the gates of the Independence Palace around noon. Tank 843 (a Soviet T-54 tank) was the first to directly hit and struck the side gate of the Palace. This historic moment was recorded by the Australian cameraman Neil Davis. Tank 390 (a Chinese Type 59 tank) then crashed through the main gate in the middle to enter the front yard. For many years, the official record of Vietnamese government and international historical sources maintained that tank 843 was the first one to enter the Presidential Palace. However, in 1995, French war photographer Françoise Demulder published her photo showed that tank 390 entered the main gate while tank 843 was still behind the steel columns of the smaller gate on the right hand side (view from inside) and tank 843&#x27;s commander Bui Quang Than was running with the Vietcong flag on his hand. Both tanks were declared national treasures in 2012 and each was displayed in a different museum in Hanoi. Lieutenant Bui Quang Than pulled down the Flag of South Vietnam on top of the Palace and raised the Viet Cong flag at 11:30 am on 30 April 1975.

The Tank Brigade 203 soldiers entered the Palace and found Minh and all members of his cabinet sitting and waiting for them. The political commissar Lieutenant colonel Bùi Văn Tùng arrived at the Palace ten minutes after the first tanks. Minh realised this was the highest-ranking officer around then said: &quot;We are waiting to hand over the cabinet&quot;, Tung replied immediately: &quot;You have nothing to hand over but your unconditional surrender to us&quot;. Tung then wrote a speech announcing the surrender and dissolution of what remained of the South Vietnamese government. He then escorted Minh to the Radio Saigon to read it to avoid further needless bloodshed. The surrender announcement was recorded by German journalist Börries Gallasch&#x27;s tape recorder.

Colonel Bùi Tín, a military journalist was at the Palace around noon to witness the events. In his memoir, he confirmed that Lt.-Col Bùi Văn Tùng was the one who accepted the surrender and wrote the statement for Minh. However, in an interview with WGBH Educational Foundation in 1981, he falsely claimed that he was the first high officer who met Minh and accepted the surrender (with Tung&#x27;s words). This claim was repeated after his defection from Vietnam and sometimes cited mistakenly by foreign correspondents and historians.

At 2:30 Minh announced the formal surrender of South Vietnam:
Bùi Văn Tùng then took the microphone and announced, &quot;We, the representatives for the forces of the Liberation Army of South Vietnam, solemnly declare that the City of Saigon was completely liberated. We accepted the unconditional surrender of General Dương Văn Minh, the president of the Saigon administration&quot;. This announcement marked the end of the Vietnam War.

==Aftermath==

===Turnover of Saigon===
The communists renamed the city after Ho Chi Minh, former President of North Vietnam, although the name &quot;Saigon&quot; continued to be used by many residents and others. Order was slowly restored, although the by-then-deserted U.S. Embassy was looted, along with many other businesses. Communications between the outside world and Saigon were cut. The Viet Cong machinery in South Vietnam was weakened, owing in part to the Phoenix Program, so the PAVN was responsible for maintaining order and General Trần Văn Trà, Dũng&#x27;s administrative deputy, was placed in charge of the city. The new authorities held a victory rally on 7 May.

One objective of the Communist Party of Vietnam was to reduce the population of Saigon, which had become swollen with an influx of people during the war and was now overcrowded with high unemployment. &quot;Re-education classes&quot; for former soldiers in the ARVN indicated that to regain full standing in society they would need to move from the city and take up farming. Handouts of rice to the poor, while forthcoming, were tied to pledges to leave Saigon for the countryside. According to the Vietnamese government, within two years of the capture of the city one million people had left Saigon, and the state had a target of 500,000 further departures.

Following the end of the war, according to official and non-official estimates, between 200,000 and 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to re-education camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while they were being forced to do hard labor.

===The evacuation===
Whether the evacuation had been successful or not has been questioned following the end of the war. Operation Frequent Wind was generally assessed as an impressive achievement—Dũng stated this in his memoirs and &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as being carried out with &quot;efficiency and bravery&quot;. On the other hand, the airlift was also criticized for being too slow and hesitant, and it was inadequate in removing Vietnamese civilians and soldiers who were connected with the American presence.

The U.S. State Department estimated that the Vietnamese employees of the U.S. Embassy in South Vietnam, past and present, and their families totaled 90,000 people. In his testimony to Congress, Martin asserted that 22,294 such people were evacuated by the end of April. In 1977, &quot;National Review&quot; alleged that some 30,000 South Vietnamese had been systematically killed using a list of CIA informants left behind by the U.S. embassy.

An iconic photograph of evacuees entering an Air America helicopter on the roof of the apartment building at 22 Gia Long Street is frequently mischaracterized as showing an evacuation from the &quot;U.S. Embassy&quot; via a &quot;military&quot; helicopter.

==Commemoration==
30 April is celebrated as a public holiday in Vietnam as Reunification Day (though the official reunification actually occurred on 2 July 1976) or &quot;Liberation Day&quot; (Ngày giải phóng). Along with International Workers&#x27; Day on 1 May, most people take the day off work and there are public celebrations.

Among most overseas Vietnamese, the week of 30 April is referred to as &quot;Black April&quot; and it is also commemorated as a time of lamentation for the fall of Saigon and South Vietnam as a whole.

==In popular culture==

<text>Ralph Sheheen (born August 23, 1964) is an American sports announcer. He was one of the lead broadcasters of NASCAR Xfinity Series on NBCSN, and was the lead commentator of Feld Entertainment&#x27;s AMA Supercross Championship from 2006 until 2020. He also is the co-owner of the &quot;Speed Sport&quot; franchise through his stake in Turn 3 Media, LLC, which publishes the aforementioned magazine, the Web site, and both radio and television shows.

Sheheen was born in Utica, New York. Sheheen&#x27;s work at Speed Channel included anchoring &quot;SpeedNews&quot;, and being the lap-by-lap announcer for the World of Outlaws&#x27; Knoxville Nationals. His broadcasting career began in 1988, when he did an IMSA sports car race for ESPN. Sheheen&#x27;s career has grown since. He has worked for ESPN2, FSN, TNN (now Paramount Network), and CBS. While at TNN, his first job in 1992 was as a pit reporter for their coverage of the ASA. He eventually moved up to the lead lap-by-lap announcer for TNN&#x27;s ASA coverage around 1995. He became the lead announcer of TNN&#x27;s coverage of the NHRA Drag Racing Series and shared hosting duties with Steve Evans on TNN&#x27;s coverage of the World of Outlaws. He also occasionally anchored their now-defunct racing news show, &quot;NASCAR RaceDay&quot;, and at CBS, he was a pit reporter for their coverage of Winston Cup Series races, most notably the Daytona 500. In 2005, Sheheen did lap-by-lap for Dorna-produced CBS&#x27;s broadcasts of the San Marino Grand Prix, the Spanish Grand Prix, the Canadian Grand Prix, and the German Grand Prix.

Until 2005, Sheheen was the host/narrator of Speed&#x27;s coverage of the World Rally Championship, and of the network&#x27;s magazine show, &quot;WRC Rally Magazine&quot;. Sheheen has since been replaced. Speed&#x27;s on-site WRC reporter, former co-champion Nicky Grist, has seen an increase in his role.

Since 2007, Sheheen has been a pit reporter for Speed-produced &quot;NASCAR on TNT&quot;. At the 2009 New Hampshire race, he filled in for Bill Weber as the lead announcer. On July 1, 2009, it was announced by TNT and NASCAR that Sheheen will fill in for Weber at the Coke Zero 400 and the LifeLock.com 400, the final two races of TNT&#x27;s 2009 schedule.

From 2007 to 2008, Sheheen has also been the announcer for AMA Motocross Championship on the SPEED Channel, until he was replaced with the current announcer Jason Weigandt beginning in the 2009 Season.

One of Sheheen&#x27;s early positions was as a trackside race announcer at northern California&#x27;s American Federation of Motorcyclists (AFM) road course races at Sonoma Raceway in the early 1980s.

For his contributions to covering sprint car races, Sheheen was inducted into the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 2023.

<doc id="1135729" wikidata="Q1737209" url="?curid=1135729" title="Primitive Methodism in the United Kingdom">
<text>Primitive Methodism was a major movement in English and Welsh Methodism from about 1810 until the Methodist Union in 1932. It emerged from a revival at Mow Cop in Staffordshire. &quot;Primitive&quot; meant &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;relating to an original stage&quot;; the Primitive Methodists saw themselves as practising a purer form of Christianity, closer to the earliest Methodists. Although the denomination did not bear the name &quot;Wesleyan&quot; (unlike the older Wesleyan Methodist Church), Primitive Methodism was Wesleyan in theology, in contrast to the Calvinistic Methodists.

==Features==
Primitive Methodists were marked by the relatively plain design of their chapels and their low church worship, compared with the Wesleyan Methodist Church, from which they had split. Their social base was among the poorer members of society, who appreciated its content (damnation, salvation, sinners and saints) and its style (direct, spontaneous and passionate). It was democratic and locally controlled, as compared with the more middle-class Wesleyan Methodists and the establishment-controlled Church of England, which were not democratic in governance. Even so, it was too formal for some adherents, who moved on to Pentecostalism. Growth was strong in the mid-19th century, but declined after 1900 with the growing secularism in society, competition from other Nonconformisms such as William Booth&#x27;s Salvation Army, a resurgence of Anglicanism among the working classes, and competition among various Methodist bodies.

Gradually the differences between the Primitive Methodists and the Wesleyans lessened and the two denominations eventually merged with the United Methodists, to become the Methodist Church of Great Britain in 1932. In the United States, the Primitive Methodist Church has continued to this day, and some individual British Methodist churches also retain their Primitive traditions.

==Origins==
Primitive Methodism originated in &quot;camp meetings&quot; held in the area of The Potteries at Mow Cop, Staffordshire, on 31 May 1807. This led in 1811 to a joining of two groups, the &#x27;Camp Meeting Methodists&#x27; and the Clowesites led by Hugh Bourne and William Clowes, respectively.

The movement was spawned by followers of these men. Bourne and Clowes were charismatic evangelists with reputations for zeal and sympathy for ideas the Wesleyan Connexion condemned. Their least acceptable belief for the Wesleyan Connexion was support for the so-called camp meetings: day-long, open air meetings involving public praying, preaching and Love Feasts.

Clowes was a first-generation Methodist convert — at the age of 25 he renounced his desire to be the finest dancer in England. The movement was also influenced by the backgrounds of the two men: Clowes had worked as a potter while Bourne had been a wheelwright. Both had been expelled from the Wesleyan Connexion — Bourne in 1808, and Clowes in 1810. The reason given for Clowes&#x27; expulsion was that he had behaved &quot;contrary to the Methodist discipline&quot; and therefore &quot;that he could not be either a preacher or leader unless he promised to attend no more Camp Meetings.&quot;

It seems likely that this was not the only concern over the pair. Bourne&#x27;s association with the American evangelist Lorenzo Dow would have put him in a dim light with Wesleyan leaders. The Wesleyan leadership&#x27;s hostility to Dow is demonstrated by a threat Dow received from prominent Wesleyan Thomas Coke (twice president of the Conference, in 1797 and 1805) on his arrival in London about 1799. Coke threatened to &quot;write to Lord Castlereagh to inform him who and what you are, [and] that we disown you... Then you&#x27;ll be arrested and committed to prison.&quot;

The Wesleyan Connexion was also concerned about Bourne and Clowes&#x27; association with the &quot;Magic Methodists&quot; or &quot;Forest Methodists&quot; led by James Crawfoot, the &quot;old man of Delamere Forest&quot;. Crawfoot was significant to both Bourne and Clowes and was for a time their spiritual mentor. He held prayer meetings where people had visions and fell into trances. Crawfoot, according to Owen Davies, had developed a reputation for possessing supernatural powers. Indeed, Henry Wedgwood, writing later in the century, recalled that many locals at the time were terrified of the magical powers of an innkeeper called Zechariah Baddeley, but that they considered Baddeley&#x27;s powers as nothing next to Crawfoot&#x27;s prayers and preaching.

The enthusiasm associated with revivalism was seen as disreputable by the early 19th century establishment. In 1799, the Bishop of Lincoln claimed that the &quot;ranter&quot; element of Methodism was so dangerous that the government must ban itinerancy. Men like Bourne and Clowes were not educated, and their preaching and mass conversion was felt as threatening. The Wesleyan Methodists, such as Coke, wanted to distance themselves from such populism. The death of John Wesley removed a restraining influence on popular Methodism: there was no obvious leader or authority, and power was invested in the Wesleyan Conference. The Wesleyans formally split from the Church of England, which led to greater organisation and self-definition. The leadership could then withhold the tickets of members like Bourne and Clowes, who did not behave in the way expected by the Conference. The result was less tolerance for internal dissent and weakening of the movement&#x27;s leadership.

The Camp Meeting Methodists looked back to the early days of the Methodist movement, when field preaching was acceptable. Despite their exclusion from the Connexion, Clowes and Bourne and assistants who appeared to help them became involved in a task which &quot;The Romance of Primitive Methodism&quot; saw as a work of primary evangelisation. The same book also regards the Primitive Methodist denomination as an independent growth rather than as an offshoot of mainstream Methodism.

==Response to the political situation==
The leadership of the newly formed Methodist Church was made particularly sensitive to criticism by international events. Britain had been involved in almost perpetual war with France since 1793. A succession of defeats to allies and the threat of the &quot;Continental System&quot; increased tension at home.

The establishment faced a threat from the revolutionary anti-monarchical beliefs of the French government. The war and the French Revolution encouraged a fear of a rebellion in Britain. The repressive laws enacted by the second Pitt ministry came from fear of internal dissent.

In this atmosphere the Methodist leadership feared repression and strove to avoid antagonising the government. The Methodist movement challenged the Church of England — an institution widely regarded as a bulwark of national stability. As Hugh McLeod highlights, Methodist members and preachers could be outspoken in their criticism of the Church of England. The movement grew rapidly, especially amongst the expanding working classes.

The combination of rapid growth, popular appeal, and enthusiasm alarmed many. Fear of the Methodist membership seems to have been shared to an extent by the Wesleyan leadership. Dr Coke even suggested he would not be surprised if, &quot;in a few years some of our people, warmest in politics and coolest in religion, would toast… a bloody summer and a headless king.&quot;

The leadership reacted to criticism and their own fears by introducing further discipline. They expelled the prominent Alexander Kilham in 1795, and one year later they forbade any itinerant from any publishing without the sanction of the newly created book committee.

From 1805 the use of hymnals not issued by the Book Room was banned, and in 1807 Camp Meetings were condemned. Through discipline they hoped to evade the tarnish of disloyalty.

The leadership reacted badly to Lorenzo Dow and Bourne&#x27;s association with him. Dow was a republican and a millenarian. He made wild anti-establishment speeches and drew no distinction between religion and politics. In a tract of 1812, he preached: &quot;May not the &#x27;Seventh Trumpet&#x27; now be sounding, and the &#x27;seven last plagues&#x27; be pouring out?&quot; Dow accused the British government of tyranny and repugnance to God&#x27;s laws of nature. As a separate church, conscious of their own public image and fearing repression, they felt they had to disassociate themselves from him. The Wesleyan leadership&#x27;s measures to evade repression led to greater internal discipline. Members who were seen as a liability were expelled. Views that were anti-establishment were condemned.

==Wesleyan propaganda==

The Wesleyan leadership did not seek to improve its reputation with discipline alone. Through propaganda it capitalised on a greater level of discipline in an attempt to reform its image. Hempton claims the Methodists used propaganda to project an industrious and well disposed image. The &quot;Methodist Magazine&quot; printed supportive tracts about the monarchy, praising the King&#x27;s wariness of reformers. The movement was portrayed as a conservative force, with the leadership claiming Methodism promoted &quot;subordination and industry in the lower orders&quot;. In promoting this image of Methodists, the Wesleyan leaders also sought to escape old slurs. One obstacle to Methodist respectability was its association with ignorance and superstition. In Wales in 1801, the leadership warned its members against involvement in sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. In 1816, 50 members of the Portland Methodist Society were struck off for maintaining belief in the supernatural. This demonstrates that the Wesleyan transition to denominational conservatism resulted in less toleration for alternate beliefs and non-bourgeois beliefs. So the association of Bourne and Clowes with Crawfoot was unacceptable to the leadership. It also suggests a gulf between the outlook of the Wesleyan leadership and the Methodist rank and file.

==Disillusionment with Wesleyan leaders==
There was disillusionment with the Wesleyan leadership&#x27;s conservatism and with financial policies. The reaction of the Yorkshire membership to its support of the government after Peterloo is illustrated by a rumour that it had &quot;lent the government half a million of money to buy cannon to shoot them with&quot;. When a local preacher in North Shields criticised the actions of the magistrates at Peterloo, he faced criticism from itinerants and &quot;respectable friends&quot;. The leadership judged, however, that it could not afford to expel this preacher because of the support he commanded locally. The incident showed that the leadership was not representing the interests and views of some Methodists. Its policies frequently clashed with poorer Methodists. In efforts to raise money, it introduced weekly and quarterly dues, yearly collections, the payment of class and ticket money, and seat rents. Such fees bore severely on the poor in the war years and the subsequent depression, opening a gulf between richer and poorer members. Seat rents marginalised a chapel&#x27;s poor, while exalting the rich. The poor were often relegated to the least popular part of the chapel, and their involvement was implicitly devalued. At one of the earliest chapels, Walpole Old Chapel in Suffolk, attendance had once been an act of pride in the face of social superiors, but now reinforced inferiority. Such developments led to the disillusionment of rural Methodists. The poor contributions of many rural societies to the Connexion funds led to pastoral neglect. To illustrate the disillusionment of many, a pamphleteer in 1814 said, &quot;You complain the preachers never call to see you unless you are great folks... Well you may see the reason; you can do nothing for them; money they want and money they must and will have.&quot; Such disillusionment of many Methodists with the leadership of the Wesleyan Conference increased the possibility of schism.

==What was at stake==
The crucial factor was that the events came at a time when the movement had more to lose than ever before. Its withdrawal from the Church of England made chapel building and a larger ministry a necessity, while the Connexion also invested in schools, pension funds and foreign missions. Hard work and clean living had allowed many Methodists to increase their wealth and own property. All this could be lost to a fearful wartime government or a baying mob.

The Wesleyan &quot;clergy&quot; derived its income from the Church and had a vested interest in ensuring a conservative policy. It was easier for men from the lower sorts, artisans like Bourne and Clowes. Bourne was a successful businessman (a carpenter whose contacts included supplying pit-props for local coal mines) and Clowes was a master potter, who had worked his way up from working in potteries as a young boy and married into the Wedgwood family. They both had considerable education, though not at university like John Wesley, but through their own hard work earning a living. Did they have less to lose? What counted for them was a sensed call of God to continue the evangelistic work of John Wesley. In taking the name &quot;Primitive Methodist&quot;, the &quot;Prims&quot; looked back to the original and unspoiled Christianity of both John Wesley and (Wesley&#x27;s reference) of the Book of Acts. By contrast to the academic treatises on Primitive Methodism, original Primitive Methodist sources included definitive histories by Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, early biographies of Hugh Bourne like that by Jesse Ashworth from personal acquaintance, and Joseph Ritson&#x27;s classic &quot;The Romance of Primitive Methodism&quot;. These illustrate a vibrant movement which the establishment was unwilling to entertain, due partly to weariness of persecutions in the 18th century, and to political upheavals after the French Revolution and various wars in which Britain was engaged. In fact Bourne was much concerned that things be done decently and in order, and worked hard to build up the official (Wesleyan) Methodist Circuit of which he had once been a member. He had founded and built at least one Chapel, largely at his own expense, given to the Circuit. It was the issue of Camp Meetings, which Bourne and his companions saw as blessed by God, that led to their expulsion. They had not sought to found a new and separate denomination or put revivalism ahead of expediency. They had less to lose. So the Primitive Methodist movement can be seen as a reaction to the Wesleyan drive towards respectability and denominationalism. It was led by the poor and for the poor.

==Similarities and differences==
Perceived irreconcilable differences led to the schism in the Methodist movement and the formation of Primitive Methodism, but in the early 20th century, the Wesleyans and Primitives were reconciled and reunited.

The structure of the Primitive Methodists, though broadly similar to the Wesleyan Connexion, showed some pronounced differences. Both Primitives and Wesleyans employed a connexion system, employing a combination of itinerant and local preachers. Both included an array of local, circuit, district, and connexion officials and committees. According to James Obelkevich, Primitive Methodism was more decentralised and democratic. Julia Werner concurs that the movement was decentralised. Most decisions and day-to-day policy were decided at a local level. The circuits were virtually autonomous and their administration was not dominated by church officials, but by the laity.

The expansion of the movement through commissioning new missions was directed by individuals or circuits, not by a central authority. Decisions affecting the whole movement were taken at annual meetings. Even these were highly democratic, with the laity outnumbering the itinerants in voting power. The &quot;church&quot; could not dictate policy to its members. Compare the expulsions of Kilham from the Wesleyans (1795) and an outspoken &quot;malcontent&quot; from the Primitive Methodists (1824). While Bourne had to engage in a long and difficult argument before winning a vote, Dr Coke rejected a democratic decision-making process. In the early years of Primitive Methodism the membership had considerable power and freedom.

Although the Wesleyans tended towards respectability, Primitives were poor and revivalist. According to J. E. Minor, Primitive Methodist preachers were less educated and more likely &quot;to be at one with their congregations&quot; or even &quot;dominated by them&quot;. Primitive Methodist preachers were plain-speaking, in contrast to Wesleyan services &quot;embellished with literary allusions and delivered in high-flown language&quot;. Primitive Methodist preachers were plainly dressed and poorly paid. Though Wesleyan ministers in 1815 could command about £100, a house and a horse, the Primitive Methodist superintendent of the Gainsborough circuit received £62 12s in 1852. The second minister at the Gainsborough circuit received £36, about as much a farm labourer. If Primitive Methodist preachers lacked money, they were expected to turn to the Lord for support. There was also a disparity in the wealth of congregations. The Wesleyan ones were more likely to be from a lower middle class or artisan, background than the Primitive Methodists. Primitive Methodists were most likely to be small farmers, servants, mill workers, colliers, agricultural labourers, weavers and framework knitters.

The Primitive Methodists exalted its poor congregations by glorifying plain dress and speech, for two reasons: they thought plain dress was enjoined by the Gospel, and because it made them distinctive. In a time when Wesleyans sought assimilation and respectability, they wanted to stand out as a &quot;peculiar people&quot;. The Primitive Methodist movement made a virtue out of difference.

===Preaching and revivalism===
The Primitives were more likely to go against society&#x27;s norms. This is indicated in the Primitive Methodists&#x27; maintenance of revivalism. They were visible and noisy; they made use of revivalist techniques such as open-air preaching.

Their services involved a fanatical zeal that Wesleyan leaders would have found embarrassing. The hymns they sang were strongly marked by popular culture and not seen as respectable. They were often sung to popular tunes and full of references to Heaven as a place of opulence. As Werner comments, their hymns were a contrast to the &quot;more staid hymns sung in Wesleyan chapels&quot;. All their members were seen as equal and addressed as brother or sister; even children could participate fully. Many children actually became preachers, for instance boy preachers such as Thomas Brownsword, Robinson Cheeseman and John Skevington. There were also many girl preachers, such as Elizabeth White and Martha Green, who preached as 15-year-olds.

The Wesleyan Conference condemned female ministry in 1803, so effectively closing its doors to female preaching. Women were limited to working in Sunday Schools and speaking at &quot;Dorcas Meetings&quot;. By contrast, Primitive Methodism allowed the poor, the young, and women to gain public influence. Mary Dunnell was preaching from before the formation of the Primitive Methodists in 1807 and Sarah Bembridge was preaching in 1813 or 1814 at Sutton on the Hill. The Primitive Methodists were more receptive to such views, and so took a different line on the supernatural. Wesleyans tried hard to distance themselves from superstition, and superstitious popular culture. The Primitive Methodists engaged with popular beliefs in presenting God as one whose powers could be called upon by preachers.

Examples were published in the &quot;Primitive Methodist Magazine&quot;. For instance, the December 1824 edition contains an anecdote of a cripple being healed through her conversion to Primitive Methodism. The November edition from the same year contains a chapter on &quot;raising the dead&quot; under the title &quot;A Treatise on the Cultivation of the Spiritual Gifts&quot;. The &quot;Primitive Methodist Magazine&quot; of 1821 asserting that the movement had begun &quot;undesigned of man&quot; and was an example of &quot;Divine Providence&quot;. The magazine continues to reveal further examples of God&#x27;s power and favour towards them. A man who set out against the Primitive Methodists was struck down by illness, and a preacher who became lost and stranded was saved when the Lord sent people to find him.

The leadership believed in what many would deride as superstition. Clowes claimed to have fought with the Kidsgrove Boggart as a young man and Bourne believed in witches. About a woman he met at Ramsor, Bourne wrote, &quot;I believe she will prove to be a witch. These are the head labourers under Satan, like as the fathers are the head labourers under Jesus Christ... For the witches throughout the world all meet and have connection with the power devil.&quot; The magazine finds exaltations of the laity to be important at Camp Meetings. For instance, it reports that at Sheshnall in 1826, a woman fell to the ground under the purifying power of the Lord, and another cried aloud.

In the 1870s Stewart Hooson was a notable Primitive Methodist circuit preacher.

===Common factors===
The Primitive and the Wesleyan Methodists had much in common. They were both initially very anti-Catholic. Their social background was not completely different. There were many poor Wesleyans. It was in influence that middle-class Wesleyans dominated the movement, not in numbers. Many Wesleyans did not agree or abide by official policy. Many were sympathetic to revivalism and popular culture. The existence of an alternative sect, Primitive Methodism, did not end dissent.

In official policy and outlook the two movements had much in common. They both centred their teaching on the Bible and shared a similar outlook on society and morality. The Primitives were more radical than the Wesleyan Methodists. Armstrong claims Thomas Cooper found the Primitive Methodists &quot;demurred to [his] reading any book but the Bible, unless it was a truly religious book.&quot; Likewise, both wanted to reform popular behaviour. Again the Primitives were more radical than the Wesleyans and less in keeping with bourgeois correctness. Bourne was not just in favour of temperance, he disagreed with alcohol altogether and thought of himself as the father of the teetotal movement. The Primitive Methodists were a religion of popular culture. While the Wesleyans attempted to impose elements of middle-class culture on the lower classes, Primitive Methodists offered an alternate popular culture. They timed their activities to coincide with sinful events. For instance, they vied against the race week at Preston by organising a Sunday School children&#x27;s parade and a &quot;frugal feast&quot;. Both tried to inculcate the doctrine of self-help into the working class. They promoted education through Sunday Schools, though the Primitives distinguished themselves by teaching writing. Through a combination of discipline, preaching and education both Primitive and Wesleyan Methodism sought to reform their members&#x27; morality.

By 1850 the Primitives and Wesleyans were showing signs that they could surmount their differences. Primitive Methodism was mellowing. It was less distinctively non-middle-class by 1850 and more in keeping with social norms. Less emphasis was placed on the supernatural. In 1828 Bourne said of trances, &quot;This thing still occasionally breaks out. It is a subject at present not well understood and which requires to be peculiarly guarded against impropriety and imposture.&quot; Hymns about hell were sung less frequently. The Providence section of the &quot;Primitive Methodist Magazine&quot; declined in importance and was dropped altogether in 1862. The revivalist enthusiasm of the Primitive leadership dimmed. Even Clowes, once an ardent enthusiast, became &quot;convinced that religion does not consist in bodily movements, whether shouting, jumping, falling, or standing.&quot;

The Primitives became less ardent in their support of the female right to ecclesiastical equality. In 1828 women were forbidden from becoming superintendents, and in mid-century there ceased to be biographies eulogising female preachers in the &quot;Methodist Magazine&quot;. Elizabeth Bultitude, the last of the women roving preachers died in 1890. Preaching changed considerably. Services became marked by decorum and the ministry increasingly professional. The dress code was dropped in 1828 and preaching became more urban based. The community&#x27;s values were more in line with middle-class respectability: Parkinson Milson reported that local preachers and class leaders were offended at his plain speech.

===Convergence begins===
In the 1820s the Primitive Methodists were showing signs of increased conformity. At the same time the Wesleyan Methodists were relaxing their opposition to revivalism.

In 1820 the Conference permitted an altered form of camp meeting but gave it a different name. Wesleyan preachers adopted door-to-door techniques and in 1822 there were numerous open-air meetings. The official Wesleyan attitude was not only softening in regard to Primitive Methodist revivalist techniques. It was also softening in regard to the Primitive Methodist promotion of non-worldliness. The &quot;Methodist Magazine&quot; printed a series of articles &quot;On the Character of the Early Methodists&quot;. The magazine praised their &quot;plain dress&quot; and &quot;simplicity of manners&quot;. This represented an attempt to re-engage with the poor. By 1850, both Primitive and Wesleyan Methodists were finding that their differences were less significant and passionate.

In 1864 the Primitives established Elmfield College in York.

The Primitives were becoming more like the Wesleyan Methodists. The same forces that promoted schism in Wesleyan Methodism operated on Primitive Methodism. Their leaders became more conservative as they got older. They showed signs of moving away from revivalism and intending to impose greater discipline on the membership. They experienced some schisms in the 1820s. These Primitive Methodist troubles were blamed on the admission of &quot;improper&quot; preachers and &quot;questionable characters&quot;. The sentiment of this explanation is similar to Bunting&#x27;s comments that &quot;schism from the body will be a less evil than schism in it.&quot; The problems in the 1820s were often related to money matters. A decision by the conference of 1826 to impose tighter financial discipline on the circuits led to an exodus of members and 30 itinerants. The movement became more geared towards consolidation through greater organisation. In 1821 preachers were called upon to record their activities and in 1822 a preachers&#x27; manual was published. Preachers now had guidelines, an element of accountability had been introduced, and the leadership had stated that the connexional accounts had priority over spreading the word.

==Methodist Union==

In 1932 the Primitive Methodist Church merged with the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the United Methodists to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain. The Primitive Methodist Church was represented at the merging denominations&#x27; Uniting Conference by William Younger, who had been elected President that year.

==Bible==
A leading theologian of the Primitive Methodists was Arthur Peake, Professor of Biblical Criticism at University of Manchester in 1904–1929. He popularized modern biblical scholarship, including the new &quot;higher criticism&quot;. He approached the Bible not as the infallible word of God, but as a record of revelation written by fallible humans.

==Organisation and conferences==

In Scotland the Primitive Methodists were poorly funded and had trouble building churches and supporting ministers. Organisationally, the Prims followed many Wesleyan precedents, including grouping local societies into Circuits, and from 1824, grouping Circuits into Districts. By 1824 there were 72 Circuits and four Districts — Tunstall, Nottingham, Hull, and Sunderland.

From 1820, the Primitive Methodists held an annual conference, which was nominally the church&#x27;s ultimate legal authority. However, from 1843 to 1876 the District Meetings grew in power and popularity at the expense of Conference (Lysons: 22 and ch. 4).

<text>iStumbler is a utility for finding wireless networks and devices with AirPort or Bluetooth-enabled Macintosh computers.

== History ==
iStumbler was originally based on MacStumbler source code. Its early development focused on detection of open wireless (802.11) networks, but more recent versions support the detection of Bluetooth wireless devices and Bonjour network services.

Up to release 99, iStumbler was open-source under a BSD license. It was later changed to nagware, having a pop-up screen every 30 minutes but otherwise being fully functional. Current releases require a payment to use.

The app has been delisted from the Mac App Store by the developers due to it not functioning properly on macOS Monterey and above.

== Usage ==
iStumbler uses the AirPort card built into Macs. It automatically scans for Wi-Fi and WLAN networks, and can also detect Bluetooth, Bonjour, and other AirPort networks. The software shows a graph which displays the network name, the type of security, the vendor, the signal, the channel, and the MAC address of listed networks. A graph showing the history of signal strength can also be displayed. It can be used to join listed AirPort networks without configuration and to join Bluetooth networks as well. It uses GPS data to display the coordinates of the computer being used and nearby Wi-Fi points.

iStumbler works by sending out probe requests to all available access points and displaying the information received from those requests.

<text>York Mills is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is centred around Yonge Street and York Mills Road located in the district of North York. In 2010, it encompassed the fourth and seventh most affluent postal codes in Canada. It is recognized as a millionaires&#x27; mile, alongside the other Toronto neighbourhoods of The Bridlepath, Forest Hill, and Rosedale.

Part of the area is also known as Hoggs Hollow, named for James Hogg, a Scottish settler who settled in the area in 1824 and operated the mill on Yonge Street at the Don River north of the Town of York (now Toronto), by his sons John and William in 1856. Another portion is named St. Andrew-Windfields. St. Andrew-Windfields most famous resident was the popular Canadian Philanthropist E. P. Taylor who left Canada towards the latter years of his life and donated Parkland (now Windfields Park) and his mansion (now the Canadian Film Centre).

==History==
The area name is linked to saw and grist mills that dotted the Don River, which flows through York Mills. The Town of York Mills became part of the Township of North York. 

The area once linked by radial railways (Metropolitan line and the successor North Yonge Railways) and Highway 11, now can be reached via Highway 401, GO Transit, and Toronto Transit Commission buses and York Mills station on the Yonge-University Spadina subway line.

In 1953, York Mills, along with North York, was severed from York County, joining other municipalities to form the regional government of Metropolitan Toronto. The area was the site of a tragic accident on March 17, 1960, when five Italian construction workers on a water main project were killed in a tunnel fire. North York later became a borough, and then a city, and was merged with five other municipalities and a regional government to form the new &quot;City of Toronto&quot; in 1998.

Today, the area is home to luxury condos and high-end homes. Houses in York Mills are highly distinguishable and contribute greatly to the proclaimed affluence of the neighbourhood. 50% of occupied dwellings are single detached houses. Many have been rebuilt and customized to taste, with heavily renovated front yards. In between 2001 and 2006, property values have increased by 47.6%. The second type of most occupied dwelling is apartments reaching five or more storeys, inhabited by 28% of the population. The average price for condominiums in the area ranges from C$800,000 to C$3,000,000, while the average price of a detached home is just above C$4,000,000.

===St. Andrew&#x27;s Golf Course===

From 1927 to 1950s the area south of Highway 401 and east of Yonge Street was home to St. Andrew&#x27;s Golf Course. Designed by Stanley Thompson as an 18-hole course and later as 27 hole course, it was sold to developers and now a residential area centred at Old Yonge Street and the Links Road. The course hosted the Canadian Open in 1935 and 1936.

==Geography==

From Yonge Street eastward, the roads slope upward but plateau as they reach Bayview Avenue. The natural environment is also highly integrated into the neighbourhood, with development seeming to build around it. The presence of greenery is a protected and distinguishable feature of York Mills.

===Man-made environment===
South of York Mills Road and Yonge Street sits the sub-neighbourhood of Hoggs Hollow. Houses in this residential area are embedded into the natural landscape, which ascends southward. The directional slope and other natural features serve as identifiable landmarks, edges, and paths, making this area highly legible in terms of a Lynchian analysis. The area has more community-oriented characteristics that make it distinct from the rest of York Mills. Most notably, residents manage a community board located in the centre of this sub-neighbourhood.

As York Mills is a mainly residential neighbourhood, commercial activity occurs strictly at intersections of major arterials. At Yonge Street and York Mills Road, the tallest commercial building in the neighbourhood, York Mills Centre, holds large office and retail spaces.

Along York Mills Road in between major intersections, there are only single detached houses. The pedestrian paths are very close to roads. Residential area here leaves no space for any commercial opportunities, thus commercial nodes are only available at the intersection of major arterial roads.

There is very little public space. Properly maintained parks are often playgrounds for children. Actual parks do not properly serve the public as well with its lack of seating and walkways, which discourages overall usage. Free parking compared to the high hourly rates of the rest of Toronto points to space in York Mills as being an inexpensive commodity, yet there is very little space actually available for development.
The current Official Plan does not provide for the anticipation of future development.

====Landmarks====

Points of interest in York Mills:

* George S. Pratt House
* Miller Tavern
* St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church
* William and Elizabeth Harrison House
* Windfields Park
==Education==
Two public school boards operate schools in York Mills, the English-first language Toronto District School Board (TDSB), and the French-first language Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV).

TDSB also operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, York Mills Collegiate Institute.

TDSB also operate six schools that provide primary education. They include:

* Dunlace Public School
* Harrison Public School
* Owen Public School
* St. Andrew&#x27;s Middle School
* Windfield Middle School

CSV operates one secondary school in the neighbourhood, École secondaire Étienne-Brûlé. They do not operate an elementary school in the neighbourhood, with CSV elementary students residing in York Mills, attending schools in other neighbourhood.

The separate school boards for the City of Toronto, the English-based Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the French-based Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM) also offer schooling to residents of York Mills, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood, with CSCM/TCDSB students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

==Transportation==

As a result of the man-made environment, large lots, and sprawled out nodes of commercial activity, the neighbourhood is highly reliant on the automobile for everyday activities, with approximately two thirds of the York Mills population using it as a primary mode of transportation . Having Highway 401 in such close proximity adds to the benefits of owning a car, as the degree of mobility to the rest of Toronto greatly increases. Public transit is reported to be less than a quarter of the population&#x27;s primary method of commute.

Deeper in the residential areas, pedestrian walkways are often only found on one side of the road. As much of the land surrounding the major arterials are claimed by private residences, there is no room to develop along pedestrian paths and make walking a more appealing option. The combined effect of this lack of appeal, poor infrastructural maintenance, and extended distance in between points of interests justify the populations&#x27; avoidance of walking, with a mere three percent of the population claim walking as their primary mode of commute. York Mills is an example of a neighbourhood stuck within the cycle of auto-dependency.

Public transportation is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Services provided TTC include Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway, and several bus routes. The TTC operates one subway station in the neighbourhood, York Mills station. Oriole GO Station is also situated in the northeast of the neighbourhood, providing access to GO Transit&#x27;s regional commuter railway.

<text>Thistletown is a culturally diverse neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It consists of the area surrounding the intersection of Albion Road and Islington Avenue. The borders of Thistletown are generally delineated by the Humber River: the West Branch to the south, slightly beyond the river to the east, and to the William Osler Health Centre - Etobicoke General Hospital just above the river in the north. The western border is Kipling Avenue, though the part of the neighbourhood west of Islington is sometimes considered a separate area named Beaumonde Heights.

Established as a postal village in 1847, it served the surrounding farms of Etobicoke Township. The area remained largely agricultural until after World War II, joining Metropolitan Toronto in 1953. By the 1970s, residential subdivisions replaced the farm lands of Thistletown. Today the area is fully urban.

This area has seen many changes and many ethnic groups arrive and flourish. Presently the corners of Albion and Islington in Thistletown has a large presence of East Indian stores and services. They are joined by a variety of Caribbean, Indian, Sri Lankan, and Pakistani stores. 43% of those living in this area, more specifically the CT-0250.05 are of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Nepali origin, with those of black origin making up 22%. One landmark is the Franklin Carmichael Art Group at 34 Riverdale Drive, is named for Group of Seven member Franklin Carmichael by an art foundation founded by his widow and Dr. Ann Curtin.

==History==

The village of Thistletown (originally called St Andrew&#x27;s) was planned for John Grubb (1783-1850) in 1847 around the intersection of Albion Road and Islington Avenue. Grubb migrated from Scotland to Etobicoke in 1833. The property was part of John Grubb&#x27;s farmlands. Grubb was a promoter of the Albion and the Weston plank toll road companies, an elected member of the Home District Council and a magistrate. Although originally known as St. Andrew&#x27;s (likely to honour his Scottish roots after the Patron Saint of Scotland), Thistletown was renamed in honour of Dr. William Thistle, the local physician.

In 1933, Thistletown became a Police village and 2 trustees were elected.

In the late 1950s development from the expanding city of Toronto reached Thistletown when a subdivision, Albion Gardens, was developed on local potato farm to the north and east of Albion Road.

==Institutions==
*Thistletown Regional Centre of Children and Adolescents - started as The Hospital for Sick Children Thistletown Branch in 1927
*Albion West Plaza

;Parks
*Albion Gardens Park
*Beaumonde Heights Park
*Kipling Heights Park
*Rowntree Mills Park - named for Joseph Rowntree, a 19th century settler who established the &quot;Greenholme Mills&quot; on the Humber River, including a grist mill built in 1848 in Etobicoke.

;Churches
*Our Saviour Lutheran Church (1957)
*Thistletown Baptist Church
*Fellowship (2012 merger of Albion Gardens and Pine Ridge) Presbyterian Church
*St Andrews Roman Catholic Church

==Schools==
The original school in the district was Thistletown Public School which opened in 1874. It was a one room school house built on the east side of Islington Av., just south of Albion Rd. before moving eastward to Village Green in 1901. A new building was erected in 1947 and the school was renamed to Thistletown Middle School before closing in 1985 by the Etobicoke Board of Education. Today, the school now operates as a multi-service community centre.

Today, five elementary schools operate in the neighbourhood:

*Braeburn Junior School
*St Andrews Catholic Elementary School
*St John Vianney Catholic Elementary School
*Beaumonde Heights Junior Middle School
*École élémentaire catholique Saint-Noël-Chabanel

The Toronto District School Board is the only school board to operate a secondary school in the area, Thistletown Collegiate Institute.

<doc id="1135738" wikidata="Q5610561" url="?curid=1135738" title="Grosse Pointe Yacht Club">
<text>The Grosse Pointe Yacht Club (GPYC) is a private yacht club located on the shore of Lake St. Clair in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan. The club is a member of the Detroit Regional Yacht-racing Association (DRYA). The clubhouse is prominently visible and a well-known landmark along the shoreline of the lake north of Detroit.

==History==
The club was initially founded as the Grosse Pointe Ice Boat Club in 1910 by Frank Verheyden. However, in 1918, the club was converted into the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club.

The Mediterranean Revival clubhouse was conceptualized by Boston architect Guy Lowell, who was commissioned in the 1920s to design the building. Lowell died at sea before his plans were fully developed, but his concept of the clubhouse was posthumously adopted for the club.

After several budget cutbacks and cost overruns, the clubhouse officially opened on July 4, 1929. The original clubhouse included a ball room and several dining rooms, with the largest being able to seat 250. However, increasing budget overruns left the clubhouse in debt during the Great Depression, causing it to foreclose despite attempts from the club to solicit more members. Several optimistic members purchased the club back from creditors during the beginning of World War II, as they predicted an increase in household spending power. 

In 1984, the board hired Charles Terrence McCafferty &amp; Associates for $1,000,000 to redesign the dining and social facilities of the clubhouse. After a successful proposal, Edward V. Monahan, Inc. was contracted to build the expansions.

In 1997 the GPYC was named the “Number One Yacht Club in America” and is still considered among the best, earning &quot;Club of Excellence&quot; and &quot;Distinguished Club&quot; awards in consecutive years since 2019. The GPYC provides all the traditional amenities of a classic yacht club, including an Olympic-sized swimming pool, tennis and bowling facilities, as well as elegant dining rooms and a ballroom. Boating members enjoy the GPYC’s central location on Lake St. Clair and the club maintains a spacious deep-water marina with a private gas dock.

The GPYC maintains membership in the Detroit Regional Yachting Association and holds two annual DRYA-sanctioned sailing regattas each year in addition to numerous other sailing-related events and programs.

The bell tower serves as a navigational aid for boaters on the lake.

==Clubhouse==

Upon entering the club a 50-foot foyer leads to a rotunda which leads to points throughout the club. A bronze sculpture of Wheeler Williams, entitled &quot;Rhythm of the Waves&quot;, is a prominent feature. Amenities of the club, besides the marina itself, include a bowling alley that is open year round, an Olympic-size pool, several clay tennis courts, two lighted paddle tennis courts, pickle ball courts and a sailing center.

The club includes 3 dining rooms, a main ballroom, six bars, a pool deck and two wine cellars. The club facilities have been updated and modernized several times. The harbor has been enlarged and improved as membership quadrupled. However, the architectural integrity of Lowell&#x27;s original design and the views of Lake St. Clair have been maintained. A view of the club is shown as a background to the rolling credits at the end of the movie &quot;Gran Torino&quot; (2008) starring Clint Eastwood. as well as an aerial view of the club&#x27;s tower panning to encompass Lakeshore Dr. in a scene in the 1997 John Cusak film &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot;.

<text>Hadag Nahash ( &quot;&quot;, ) is an Israeli hip hop and funk band, founded in 1996 in Jerusalem, which makes leftist political statements in many of its protest songs.

==History==
Hadag Nahash has been a major contributor to the Israeli hip-hop scene, and is presently one of Israel&#x27;s most successful bands, with eight studio albums released to date.
The band&#x27;s songs call for peace, tolerance and equality, and include political and social protest. Most songs are written by Sha&#x27;anan Streett, the band&#x27;s lead vocalist. &quot;We demand the freedom to write whatever we want at any given time, and that can be about, for example, marijuana or just having a good time, as well as social injustice. It’s not one or the other. Our lives contain both. And when we want to keep it real, we have to speak about both.&quot;

Yossi Fine also produced the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Homer Mekomi&quot; (, &quot;Local Material&quot;), which was released in 2004. The biggest hit out of the album was &quot;Shirat Hasticker&quot; (, &quot;The Sticker Song&quot;), which was written by Israeli novelist David Grossman.

In 2006, Hadag Nahash released their fourth studio album, &quot;Be&#x27;ezrat Hajam&quot; (, &quot;With Help of the Jam&quot;, a wordplay on the expression &quot;With God&#x27;s Help&quot;), which was named Album of the Year at the Israel Music Awards. The album, recorded at In the Pocket studios in California, was the first album in which the vocals were divided equally between Sha&#x27;anan Streett and DJ Guy Mar. &quot;Be&#x27;ezrat Hajam&quot; contained the hit &quot;Hine Ani Ba&quot; (, &quot;Here I Come&quot;) written by Guy Mar about moving from his hometown Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. &quot;Hine Ani Ba&quot; is also an example of a song with a political or cultural message, as it depicts a cultural struggle between Jerusalem, a symbol of Israel&#x27;s heritage, and Tel Aviv, a hub for young people and nightlife. 

In December 2009, Hadag Nahash released the first single from its sixth album (fifth studio album), &quot;6&quot;: a protest song against the rising internal violence in Israeli society, called &quot;Od Ach Ehad&quot; (, &quot;One More Brother&quot;). 

Their second-most recent song, , was released as a single on 3 August 2020 and was produced by Johnny Goldstein. The lyrics reference ongoing protests against the thirty-fifth government of Israel, calling to &quot;break the cycle of Miri, Bibi, Miki, Bibi, Benny, Bibi&quot; and asking for the release of Avera Mengistu.

<text>Orange Amps is an English amplifier manufacturing company, noted for their products&#x27; distinctive sound and the bright orange Tolex-like covering of their heads and speaker cabinets. The company was founded in 1968 by Cliff Cooper, who decided to build his own amplifiers when vendors refused to supply his West End musical instrument store, Orange Store, due to Cooper&#x27;s youth and countercultural image. Cooper also founded related companies, including the Orange record label in 1969.

The brand&#x27;s early amps were adopted by Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac and were used on Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot;, which brought Orange worldwide recognition. The brand&#x27;s &quot;Pics Only&quot; models—nicknamed for their use of symbols rather than text on their control panels—were released in the early 1970s to much success and established a signature &quot;Orange sound.&quot; However, large-scale production of Orange Amps ceased in 1978 and Cooper spent the &#x27;80s building and selling amps in limited numbers. After a line of reissue models licensed by Gibson in the early &#x27;90s proved unsuccessful, Cooper regained control of the brand and found new success with the 1998 release of the AD30, with notable fans like Jimmy Page. In 2003, Orange released the Rockerverb series, which has become a favorite amp among heavy metal guitarists.

==History==
===1960s===

Orange was founded in 1968 by musician and electronics designer Clifford Cooper of London, and opened premises at 3 New Compton Street in London&#x27;s West End. Initially, Cooper used only the basement as a professional recording studio. The original studio featured an IBC mixing console originally owned by Joe Meek, producer of The Millionaires. Because the studio failed to meet its business costs, on September 2, 1968 the ground floor premises were opened as a music shop. In order to cover wage costs for the business, Cooper sold his own electronic musical equipment.

Difficulties in obtaining stock meant that the new Orange shop at first dealt only in second hand equipment. Many musicians around that time preferred older, used, or beaten-up guitars as they were considered to be of better quality and have more character than the new ones available. The Orange shop was the first to cater for this market. The difficulties faced in stocking the shop led Cooper to design Orange&#x27;s own amplifiers. In late autumn of 1968, Huddersfield based company Radio Craft, owned by Mat Mathias, was appointed to produce the first Orange-branded amplifiers.

Whilst in London, Orange shop salesman Mick Dines became closely involved with the design of Orange cabinets. Because Dines was a touring musician, he understood how road travel strained equipment and led to breakdown. Dines ensured that durability was at the forefront of the Orange design, with features such as the basketweave grillecloth. Additionally, wooden skids provided strength and improved the sound dramatically by acoustically coupling the cabinet to the stage or wooden floor.

It is a common misconception that the earliest Orange amplifiers were jointly produced by Orange and Matamp, the brand name that Mathias used on his own design of amplifiers. This was not the case. Radio Craft produced hi-fi guitar amplifiers which, whilst ideal for bass guitar, produced a tone far too clean and flat for electric lead guitars. Early Orange Matamp amplifiers were built by Radio Craft to Cooper&#x27;s specification to provide a new generation of guitarists with the sustain they demanded. The front end was modified and Cooper changed the chassis from lightweight aluminium to enamelled steel. The Orange logo was designed to be clearly visible on stage. When the design was delivered to Radio Craft, Mathias suggested that a small Matamp logo be added. As a courtesy to Mathias, Cooper agreed to this request, making Matamp a model name.

The first of the Orange Matamp amplifiers were 100 watt valve amps and were produced in very small numbers in the rear of a tobacconist shop owned by Mathias. Demand for Orange amplifiers grew quickly and Radio Craft was unable to keep up with orders. It became apparent that larger premises were required for business growth.

Mathias was unable to finance the move at the time. In 1969, Cooper Mathias Ltd was formed to replace Radio Craft. Cooper&#x27;s feeling was that a 50/50 partnership would be to the advantage of all parties, rather than to simply finance Radio Craft with the benefit of cheaper overheads in Huddersfield than in London. The central plan behind Cooper Mathias was to increase capacity and productivity to a level at which the service could be offered to other amplifier companies.

===1970s===
The factory in Cowcliffe near Huddersfield was opened in early 1970. Mathias would drive from Huddersfield with a small number of completed amplifier chassis which would be fitted into sleeves, boxed, and despatched from the Orange Shop in London. At this time business in London was moving very rapidly; however, the situation in Huddersfield was much slower. Whilst visiting the factory for a production meeting, Cooper was struck by the slow pace of production. Large numbers of back orders meant that production at Cowcliffe was failing to keep up with demand and the low number of units being produced caused the operation to be non cost effective and not covering its overheads.

The decision was taken to end Orange&#x27;s relationship with Matamp. Cooper and Mathias remained on friendly terms despite the split, with Cooper describing Mathias as &quot;a real gentleman for whom I have always had nothing but the greatest admiration.&quot; After the decision to cease production in Huddersfield, Cooper located premises in a derelict shop on the corner of Neil&#x27;s Yard and Shorts Gardens in the Covent Garden area of London. This move was to increase productivity and to provide more room for cabinet making, amp testing, and storage, with cabinets being produced on the ground floor and amplifiers in the basement.
In 1971, whilst driving in London, Cooper noticed the new road signs being introduced into the UK used graphic symbols rather than words and asked the design team to come up with a set of custom symbols that would clearly show what the control was for and would make sense to users who may not be familiar with English.

It was in 1972 that John James, Orange&#x27;s Research and Development Engineer, designed what would become one of the world&#x27;s most iconic amplifiers, The &quot;Graphic Valve Amplifier,&quot; nicknamed simply &quot;Pics Only&quot;, which was a reference to the unique front graphic panels. Early models of the Pics Only were known as &quot;Plexis&quot; because they had a plastic reverse printed perspex panel secured on an orange steel backplate fixed to the chassis. With later models the front panel was not plastic but silk screen printed metal plates. The Pics Only was the start of the new sound now associated with Orange and has remained the influence for the design and sound of Orange Amplifiers. With demand for Orange amplifiers still increasing it was necessary once again to seek larger premises and locate a proper factory facility.

In 1973, production was moved to 17 Upland Road, Bexleyheath, in Kent. There a proper production line was possible, and this resulted in a marked increase in the number of amplifiers and cabinets being completed, an average of one amp per worker per day. This more industrial approach meant that amplifiers and cabinets could be lined up, 20–30 units at a time, and completed sequentially. This period saw distribution of Orange products in the US for the first time. It was also in 1973 that the Pics Only was redesigned. As well as some electronic modifications, the front panel was amended resulting in the Graphic 120 &quot;Pics &amp; Text&quot; amplifier which was launched in 1974.

In 1975, Orange launched the Custom Reverb Twin MKII which was introduced to compete directly with the Fender Twin Reverb; similarly priced, this amp featured a Hammond spring reverb, a tremolo, and a master volume. It was initially available only as a 50 Watt but the success of this model as a versatile studio amplifier led to a 100 Watt version being produced. Unusually, this model featured black with silver fleck speaker cloth rather than the iconic Basketweave grille cloth.

The Orange brand was well established as a manufacturer of valve amps by the mid-1970s, but Cooper was keen to diversify the Orange product range and include solid state amplifiers for the first time. OMEC, which stands for Orange Music Electronic Company, was formed. Cooper engaged designer Peter Hamilton with the brief to design a computerised amp. The only way to achieve this was with the use of SSI and MSI (small and medium scale logic chips.)

At the time there was a stark choice, largely due to cost, between TTL (transistor-transistor logic) which consumed a large amount of power but was readily available and well proven or a new technology from RCA called COS-MOS which was low power consumption but prone to static damage. At the time COS-MOS was considered too risky to use. That technology led to today&#x27;s CMOS microcontrollers with built in static protection, low power consumption, and millions of transistors on a single chip. Hamilton&#x27;s design was known as the OMEC Digital Programmable Amplifier and was the world&#x27;s first digitally programmable amplifier. Real DSP was not readily available until the mid-1990s so the OMEC Digital was effectively a digitally controlled analogue amplifier. A drawback to using TTL became apparent quite quickly as the programmable memory took almost an amp at 5 watts, so any settings were lost as soon as the amplifier was turned off. A backup battery was added in the event of a brief power cut but these would only last approximately one hour. Ultimately, the OMEC Digital Amplifier proved to be innovative but ahead of its time and would require a huge amount of investment to make it financially viable.

Whilst the programmable computerised amplifier was perhaps released a decade too soon, Orange continued to produce solid state amplifiers, with the denim clad Jimmy Bean amp being released in 1976. The low cost but high quality integrated circuit chips used in the OMEC allowed for a wealth of innovative signal processing technology to be adapted to other amplifiers and, when coupled with a proven power amp design, led to the launch of a series of solid state amps and matching cabinets throughout 1976 to 1979.

By the late 1970s the music world had moved on significantly from the psychedelic hippie movement of the 1960s and the decision was taken to update the design of the range. The typeface was changed to a more modern font, the sleeve was lowered to give a sleeker look, and the basketweave grille was changed to a black material with a different level of sound transparency. As part of this major makeover in 1978/1978 Orange divided its product range into Orange Sound Reinforcement and Orange Instrument Amplification. Sound reinforcement included PA, mixing desks, and solid state power amps. Examples of models from this period include the Series Two and the Hustler range of guitar and bass amplifiers.

In 1978 the Orange Shop closed when the buildings on New Compton Street were demolished. Production ceased at the Bexleyheath factory in 1979 when two major overseas distributors going into liquidation within a short period of time made the production line no longer viable.

===1980s===

Throughout the 1980s production of Orange Amplifiers was extremely limited with Cooper continuing to build and sell in small quantities to special order.

===1990s===

====The Orange Gibson Years 1993–1997====
Following Mathias&#x27; death in 1989, his sons Peter and Richard continued the business until 1992 when the company was sold to amplifier enthusiast Jeff Lewis. In 1993, Gibson licensed the name to manufacture Orange Amplification. Gibson decided to have their Orange amplifiers made by Matamp in Huddersfield again in order to keep the &quot;Made in England&quot; identity. The first Gibson era Orange reissues released were the Graphic 120 and Overdrive 120 launching in 1994 followed by the Graphic 80 and Overdrive 80.

Sonically, there was a marked difference between these reissues and the original 1970s Pics &amp; text heads. The capacitors fitted in the EQ section had Series Two Overdrive Head values. A small number of Orange Super Bass 120 reissues were also made based on the circuit of the 1979 Series Two Super Bass. The 1990s Orange reissues were not commercially successful and it was mutually agreed that the licence would not be renewed. In February 1997, Gibson handed the Orange name back to Cliff Cooper.

====1997–1999====

=====Renewed success=====
With the brand back under Cooper&#x27;s control, guitarist and valve amplifier expert, Adrian Emsley was brought in as technical director with the brief to update and refresh the product range. Guitarist Noel Gallagher had used Orange almost exclusively on the early Oasis albums and as in the early days of Orange, Cooper was keen to get opinions from leading guitarists so Cooper and Emsley approached Gallagher to talk through any requirements that would improve his sound.

Gallagher was using an Orange Overdrive which he required more crunch from. As a result, changes were made to the Overdrive circuit, including modifications to the phase inverter and preamp. A standby switch replaced the output socket on the rear. The modifications suggested by Gallagher formed the basis of the OTR amplifier (Oscillatory Transition Return).

In 1998, the AD Series was launched. Initially consisting of the AD30 head without reverb, the AD30R, a 2×12 combo with reverb, and the AD15 combo, which was available with 10&quot; or 12&quot; speakers. The range received critical and commercial acclaim and attracted major artists such as former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page and ex-Fleetwood Mac guitarist Jeremy Spencer. In 1999, The AD15 won the Editor&#x27;s Pick Award from the US &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine – Orange being the first British company in that category to do so. The award saw global interest not only in the AD15 but in Orange as a brand and was a major factor in re-establishing the company.

===2000s===
The millennium era has seen unprecedented diversification of the Orange product range, from clothing to personal computers. Some notable events during this period include:
* 2001 Orange opens USA offices in Atlanta, Georgia.
* 2006 The Tiny Terror is launched.
* 2008 40th anniversary year – Orange produce 40 hand made Custom Shop amps each with a girl&#x27;s name.
* 2009 Orange move into new headquarters in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.
* 2010 Cliff Cooper&#x27;s son Charlie designs and launches the OPC (Orange Personal Computer) aimed at the musician/home studio market. Orange open a custom designed factory in China.
* 2018 50th anniversary of the founding of the company.

==Legacy Companies==

===Orange Studios===
Before Orange Amps, there was Orange Studios. Cliff Cooper built the studio with his friend Brian Hatt over the course of the summer, hand-cutting, stripping, and soldering every wire. &quot;Our basement studio had a great vibe,&quot; Cooper recounts, &quot;It was very large and, as nobody lived or worked on either side, volume wasn&#x27;t an issue. Most bands preferred to come in for night sessions.&quot;

===Orange Hire===

Orange Hire was created to provide the PA and backline for larger venues and outdoor summer festivals such as Reading and the Isle of Wight. A fleet of Mercedes 405D vans were converted into state-of-the-art hire vehicles all were radio equipped and had full amp repair facilities fitted. In 1972, Orange Hire was awarded the contract to provide PA equipment for music at the Olympic Games in Munich.

===Orange Management===

Orange Management was formed in 1969 signing up artists such as John Miles, Smokie, Nigel Benjamin (ex Mott The Hoople) and his band English Assassin, Cock Sparrer and The Realistics amongst others. Not limited to musical artists, in 1971 motorcycle stunt rider and model Eddie Kidd was signed to Orange Management.

===Orange Records===

While the studio recorded demos, artists found it difficult to secure a record deal. This led to the establishment of the Orange record label in 1969. A pressing and distribution deal was signed with Pye Records for the UK in 1972 and soon afterwards for other territories. The &quot;Voice of the World&quot; logo of an Orange tree sitting upon a globe was used for the label with a full colour sleeve; however, with the flower power movement waning, it was decided in the early 1970s to change the look to a black background with gold lettering.

===Orange Publishing===

Orange publishing was formed in 1969. Former Head of Copyright at EMI, Dennis Sinnott was appointed by Cliff Cooper to establish Orange Publishing and over the next five years signed a variety of bands including Cock Sparrer, The Little Roosters, The Tremeloes and Kenny Ball. Many of whom had records out on the Orange label. Orange Publishing, (now known as Orange Songs.) has a large catalogue with numerous copyrights, including the Grand Rights to several musicals and film scores.

===Orange Agency===

Orange Agency was also formed in 1969 as a means to tie together all Orange music related activities. Working from premises at 4 New Compton Street bands and artists were booked into venues around the UK. Joe Cocker was booked into The Pheasantry Club in London&#x27;s Kings Road in Chelsea, which resulted in Orange Agency becoming the sole booking agents for the venue. Bookings for The Marquee and other famous London venues followed the business grew rapidly and began booking tours, flying in acts from America to tour throughout Europe.

<text>Newtonbrook is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the area around Yonge Street and Finch Avenue in the district of North York between the east and west branches of the Don River. Officially, the area is divided into two neighbourhoods; Newtonbrook West and Newtonbrook East.

==History==
The area was settled by Europeans in the early 19th century. Newtonbrook&#x27;s early industries included saw and grist mills on the east and west branches of the Don River. The town&#x27;s Newton Brook Wesleyan Church was named after Reverend Robert Newton.

In 1847, Lieutenant Colonel William S. Durie of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada subdivided part of his Newtonbrook property. The resulting subdivision is now Drewry Avenue.

In the 1950s, Newtonbrook was subdivided for a massive residential development. Most of the town&#x27;s landmarks were removed, except for the Newtonbrook Schoolhouse and the Newtonbrook General Store. Just one house from the original Drewry Avenue subdivision remains.

As of the end of 2006, Newtonbrook was the northernmost area of Toronto to be affected by the infill development (mainly along the Finch Ave. and Yonge St. corridors). Older detached and semi-detached houses from the 1950s were demolished (or converted to mixed residential-commercial use), with townhouse complexes built in their place. There is also an increasing number of new custom built homes in this neighbourhood. A new low-rise condo building was built on the northwest corner of Yonge and Drewry.

==Demographics==

Newtonbrook contains a large community of Persian, Mandarin, Russian and Korean-speaking residents. English is the most spoken language of both Newtonbrook neighbourhoods, with Persian and Russian being the next most spoken languages of Newtonbrook West and Newtonbrook East, respectively.

The average income in the area is above the average for Toronto. Along with this, a majority of residents live in single detached or semi-detached houses which they own. 

==Education==

Three public school boards operate schools that offer primary and secondary education.

The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a secular public school board that operates two secondary schools in the neighbourhood, Newtonbrook Secondary School and Drewry Secondary School. Both schools are part of the North York Board of Education.

The Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) is a separate public school board that also operates an all-boys secondary school in Newtonbrook, Brebeuf College School. In addition to English-based public school boards, the Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM) also operates a secondary school in Newtonbrook, École secondaire catholique Monseigneur-de-Charbonnel (formerly Lewis S. Beattie Secondary School). CSCM is a French-based separate public school board. The school and headquarters are leased from the TDSB. However before 1998, Brebeuf and Charbonnel were part of the Metropolitan Separate School Board when it was an English and French board at the time.

TCDSB and TDSB operate several schools in Newtonbrook that provide primary education. They include:

* Cummer Valley Middle School (TDSB), opened in 1960 as Northmount Junior High School
* Fisherville Senior Public School (TDSB)
* Pleasant Public School (TDSB)
* R. J. Lang Elementary and Middle School (TDSB)
* St. Agnes Catholic School (TCDSB)
* St. Paschal Baylon Separate School (TCDSB)
==Recreation==

There are several shopping malls and plazas located within the neighbourhood, including Centerpoint Mall, on Steeles Avenue and Yonge Street, and Toronto Iranian Plaza. The former Newtonbrook Plaza at Yonge and Cummer was demolished in 2018-2019 for the development of M2M Condos.

Newtonbrook is also home to several municipal parks, as well as the Finch Hydro Corridor. Parks in the neighbourhood are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division.

==Transportation==
Public transportation in the neighbourhood is also serviced by the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) bus service. Newtonbrook is served by Finch subway station, which is the northern terminus of the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) Line 1 Yonge–University, located just south of the neighbourhood. In addition to TTC services, public transit services may also be accessed at Finch Bus Terminal, which provides access to GO Transit&#x27;s commuter and regional buses. York Region Transit and Viva Rapid Transit may also be accessed from the terminal.

==Notable people==
It is the birthplace and hometown of Nobel Prize winner and Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. Pearson was born at a manse in the intersection of Yonge Street and Hendon Avenue, now the site of the North American Life Centre. His father was the local Methodist minister and Lester was born in the parsonage.
