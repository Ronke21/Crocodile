<text>DNA methylation is a biological process by which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule. Methylation can change the activity of a DNA segment without changing the sequence. When located in a gene promoter, DNA methylation typically acts to repress gene transcription. In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, repression of transposable elements, aging, and carcinogenesis.

As of 2016, two nucleobases have been found on which natural, enzymatic DNA methylation takes place: adenine and cytosine. The modified bases are N6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine and N4-methylcytosine.

Cytosine methylation is widespread in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, even though the rate of cytosine DNA methylation can differ greatly between species: 14% of cytosines are methylated in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, 4% to 8% in &quot;Physarum&quot;, 7.6% in &quot;Mus musculus&quot;, 2.3% in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, 0.03% in &quot;Drosophila&quot;; methylation is essentially undetectable in &quot;Dictyostelium&quot;; and virtually absent (0.0002 to 0.0003%) from &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot; or fungi such as &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;S. pombe&quot; (but not &quot;N. crassa&quot;). Adenine methylation has been observed in bacterial and plant DNA, and recently also in mammalian DNA, but has received considerably less attention.

Methylation of cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine occurs at the same 5 position on the pyrimidine ring where the DNA base thymine&#x27;s methyl group is located; the same position distinguishes thymine from the analogous RNA base uracil, which has no methyl group. Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine converts it to thymine. This results in a T:G mismatch. Repair mechanisms then correct it back to the original C:G pair; alternatively, they may substitute A for G, turning the original C:G pair into a T:A pair, effectively changing a base and introducing a mutation. This misincorporated base will not be corrected during DNA replication as thymine is a DNA base. If the mismatch is not repaired and the cell enters the cell cycle the strand carrying the T will be complemented by an A in one of the daughter cells, such that the mutation becomes permanent. The near-universal use of thymine exclusively in DNA and uracil exclusively in RNA may have evolved as an error-control mechanism, to facilitate the removal of uracils generated by the spontaneous deamination of cytosine. DNA methylation as well as many of its contemporary DNA methyltransferases have been thought to evolve from early world primitive RNA methylation activity and is supported by several lines of evidence.

In plants and other organisms, DNA methylation is found in three different sequence contexts: CG (or CpG), CHG or CHH (where H correspond to A, T or C). In mammals however, DNA methylation is almost exclusively found in CpG dinucleotides, with the cytosines on both strands being usually methylated. Non-CpG methylation can however be observed in embryonic stem cells, and has also been indicated in neural development. Furthermore, non-CpG methylation has also been observed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and it occurred mainly in a CpApC sequence context.

== Conserved function of DNA methylation ==

The DNA methylation landscape of vertebrates is very particular compared to other organisms. In mammals, around 75% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated in somatic cells, and DNA methylation appears as a default state that has to be specifically excluded from defined locations. By contrast, the genome of most plants, invertebrates, fungi, or protists show &quot;mosaic&quot; methylation patterns, where only specific genomic elements are targeted, and they are characterized by the alternation of methylated and unmethylated domains.
High CpG methylation in mammalian genomes has an evolutionary cost because it increases the frequency of spontaneous mutations. Loss of amino-groups occurs with a high frequency for cytosines, with different consequences depending on their methylation. Methylated C residues spontaneously deaminate to form T residues over time; hence CpG dinucleotides steadily deaminate to TpG dinucleotides, which is evidenced by the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome (they occur at only 21% of the expected frequency). (On the other hand, spontaneous deamination of unmethylated C residues gives rise to U residues, a change that is quickly recognized and repaired by the cell.)

=== CpG islands ===

In mammals, the only exception for this global CpG depletion resides in a specific category of GC- and CpG-rich sequences termed CpG islands that are generally unmethylated and therefore retained the expected CpG content. CpG islands are usually defined as regions with: 1) a length greater than 200bp, 2) a G+C content greater than 50%, 3) a ratio of observed to expected CpG greater than 0.6, although other definitions are sometimes used. Excluding repeated sequences, there are around 25,000 CpG islands in the human genome, 75% of which being less than 850bp long. They are major regulatory units and around 50% of CpG islands are located in gene promoter regions, while another 25% lie in gene bodies, often serving as alternative promoters. Reciprocally, around 60-70% of human genes have a CpG island in their promoter region. The majority of CpG islands are constitutively unmethylated and enriched for permissive chromatin modification such as H3K4 methylation. In somatic tissues, only 10% of CpG islands are methylated, the majority of them being located in intergenic and intragenic regions.

=== Repression of CpG-dense promoters ===

DNA methylation was probably present at some extent in very early eukaryote ancestors. In virtually every organism analyzed, methylation in promoter regions correlates negatively with gene expression. CpG-dense promoters of actively transcribed genes are never methylated, but, reciprocally, transcriptionally silent genes do not necessarily carry a methylated promoter. In mouse and human, around 60–70% of genes have a CpG island in their promoter region and most of these CpG islands remain unmethylated independently of the transcriptional activity of the gene, in both differentiated and undifferentiated cell types. Of note, whereas DNA methylation of CpG islands is unambiguously linked with transcriptional repression, the function of DNA methylation in CG-poor promoters remains unclear; albeit there is little evidence that it could be functionally relevant.

DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in &quot;cancer.&quot;

=== Repression of transposable elements ===

DNA methylation is a powerful transcriptional repressor, at least in CpG dense contexts. Transcriptional repression of protein-coding genes appears essentially limited to very specific classes of genes that need to be silent permanently and in almost all tissues. While DNA methylation does not have the flexibility required for the fine-tuning of gene regulation, its stability is perfect to ensure the permanent silencing of transposable elements. Transposon control is one of the most ancient functions of DNA methylation that is shared by animals, plants and multiple protists. It is even suggested that DNA methylation evolved precisely for this purpose.

=== Genome expansion ===
DNA methylation of transposable elements has been known to be related to genome expansion. However, the evolutionary driver for genome expansion remains unknown. There is a clear correlation between the size of the genome and CpG, suggesting that the DNA methylation of transposable elements led to a noticeable increase in the mass of DNA.

=== Methylation of the gene body of highly transcribed genes ===

A function that appears even more conserved than transposon silencing is positively correlated with gene expression. In almost all species where DNA methylation is present, DNA methylation is especially enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes. The function of gene body methylation is not well understood. A body of evidence suggests that it could regulate splicing and suppress the activity of intragenic transcriptional units (cryptic promoters or transposable elements). Gene-body methylation appears closely tied to H3K36 methylation. In yeast and mammals, H3K36 methylation is highly enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes. In yeast at least, H3K36me3 recruits enzymes such as histone deacetylases to condense chromatin and prevent the activation of cryptic start sites. In mammals, DNMT3a and DNMT3b PWWP domain binds to H3K36me3 and the two enzymes are recruited to the body of actively transcribed genes.

== In mammals ==
=== During embryonic development ===
DNA methylation patterns are largely erased and then re-established between generations in mammals. Almost all of the methylations from the parents are erased, first during gametogenesis, and again in early embryogenesis, with demethylation and remethylation occurring each time. Demethylation in early embryogenesis occurs in the preimplantation period in two stages – initially in the zygote, then during the first few embryonic replication cycles of morula and blastula. A wave of methylation then takes place during the implantation stage of the embryo, with CpG islands protected from methylation. This results in global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells. In the post-implantation stage, methylation patterns are stage- and tissue-specific, with changes that would define each individual cell type lasting stably over a long period. Studies on rat limb buds during embryogenesis have further illustrated the dynamic nature of DNA methylation in development. In this context, variations in global DNA methylation were observed across different developmental stages and culture conditions, highlighting the intricate regulation of methylation during organogenesis and its potential implications for regenerative medicine strategies.

Whereas DNA methylation is not necessary &quot;per se&quot; for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a &quot;locked&quot; state that definitely inactivates transcription. In particular, DNA methylation appears critical for the maintenance of mono-allelic silencing in the context of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their methylation status, and loss of DNA methylation results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their methylation status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline. DNA methylation appears absolutely required in differentiated cells, as knockout of any of the three competent DNA methyltransferase results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, DNA methylation is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since DNA methylation appears to directly regulate only a limited number of genes, how precisely DNA methylation absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question.

Due to the phenomenon of genomic imprinting, maternal and paternal genomes are differentially marked and must be properly reprogrammed every time they pass through the germline. Therefore, during gametogenesis, primordial germ cells must have their original biparental DNA methylation patterns erased and re-established based on the sex of the transmitting parent. After fertilization, the paternal and maternal genomes are once again demethylated and remethylated (except for differentially methylated regions associated with imprinted genes). This reprogramming is likely required for totipotency of the newly formed embryo and erasure of acquired epigenetic changes.

===In cancer===

In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for epigenetic therapy. In developmental contexts, dynamic changes in DNA methylation patterns also have significant implications. For instance, in rat limb buds, shifts in methylation status were associated with different stages of chondrogenesis, suggesting a potential link between DNA methylation and the progression of certain developmental processes.

Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. Typically, there is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of oncogenes.

Generally, in progression to cancer, hundreds of genes are silenced or activated. Although silencing of some genes in cancers occurs by mutation, a large proportion of carcinogenic gene silencing is a result of altered DNA methylation (see DNA methylation in cancer). DNA methylation causing silencing in cancer typically occurs at multiple CpG sites in the CpG islands that are present in the promoters of protein coding genes.

Altered expressions of microRNAs also silence or activate many genes in progression to cancer (see microRNAs in cancer). Altered microRNA expression occurs through hyper/hypo-methylation of CpG sites in CpG islands in promoters controlling transcription of the microRNAs.

Silencing of DNA repair genes through methylation of CpG islands in their promoters appears to be especially important in progression to cancer (see methylation of DNA repair genes in cancer).

===In atherosclerosis===

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation have been implicated in cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis. In animal models of atherosclerosis, vascular tissue, as well as blood cells such as mononuclear blood cells, exhibit global hypomethylation with gene-specific areas of hypermethylation. DNA methylation polymorphisms may be used as an early biomarker of atherosclerosis since they are present before lesions are observed, which may provide an early tool for detection and risk prevention.

Two of the cell types targeted for DNA methylation polymorphisms are monocytes and lymphocytes, which experience an overall hypomethylation. One proposed mechanism behind this global hypomethylation is elevated homocysteine levels causing hyperhomocysteinemia, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High plasma levels of homocysteine inhibit DNA methyltransferases, which causes hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of DNA affects genes that alter smooth muscle cell proliferation, cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and increase inflammatory mediators, all of which are critical in forming atherosclerotic lesions. High levels of homocysteine also result in hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene, causing its down regulation. ERα protects against atherosclerosis due to its action as a growth suppressor, causing the smooth muscle cells to remain in a quiescent state. Hypermethylation of the ERα promoter thus allows intimal smooth muscle cells to proliferate excessively and contribute to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion.

Another gene that experiences a change in methylation status in atherosclerosis is the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In atherosclerosis patients, there is an increase in methylation of the CpG islands in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The downregulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An ex vivo experiment using the demethylating agent Decitabine (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependent manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat atherosclerosis, although no human studies have been conducted thus far.

===In heart failure===

In addition to atherosclerosis described above, specific epigenetic changes have been identified in the failing human heart. This may vary by disease etiology. For example, in ischemic heart failure DNA methylation changes have been linked to changes in gene expression that may direct gene expression associated with the changes in heart metabolism known to occur. Additional forms of heart failure (e.g. diabetic cardiomyopathy) and co-morbidities (e.g. obesity) must be explored to see how common these mechanisms are. Most strikingly, in failing human heart these changes in DNA methylation are associated with racial and socioeconomic status which further impact how gene expression is altered, and may influence how the individual&#x27;s heart failure should be treated.

===In aging===
In humans and other mammals, DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately estimate the age of tissues and cell types, forming an accurate epigenetic clock.

A longitudinal study of twin children showed that, between the ages of 5 and 10, there was divergence of methylation patterns due to environmental rather than genetic influences. There is a global loss of DNA methylation during aging.

In a study that analyzed the complete DNA methylomes of CD4+ T cells in a newborn, a 26 years old individual and a 103 years old individual were observed that the loss of methylation is proportional to age. Hypomethylated CpGs observed in the centenarian DNAs compared with the neonates covered all genomic compartments (promoters, intergenic, intronic and exonic regions). However, some genes become hypermethylated with age, including genes for the estrogen receptor, p16, insulin-like growth factor 2, ELOVL2 and FHL2

===In exercise===

High intensity exercise has been shown to result in reduced DNA methylation in skeletal muscle. Promoter methylation of PGC-1α and PDK4 were immediately reduced after high intensity exercise, whereas PPAR-γ methylation was not reduced until three hours after exercise. At the same time, six months of exercise in previously sedentary middle-age men resulted in increased methylation in adipose tissue. One study showed a possible increase in global genomic DNA methylation of white blood cells with more physical activity in non-Hispanics.

=== In B-cell differentiation ===

A study that investigated the methylome of B cells along their differentiation cycle, using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), showed that there is a hypomethylation from the earliest stages to the most differentiated stages. The largest methylation difference is between the stages of germinal center B cells and memory B cells. Furthermore, this study showed that there is a similarity between B cell tumors and long-lived B cells in their DNA methylation signatures.

=== In the brain ===

Two reviews summarize evidence that DNA methylation alterations in brain neurons are important in learning and memory. Contextual fear conditioning (a form of associative learning) in animals, such as mice and rats, is rapid and is extremely robust in creating memories. In mice and in rats contextual fear conditioning, within 1–24 hours, it is associated with altered methylations of several thousand DNA cytosines in genes of hippocampus neurons. Twenty four hours after contextual fear conditioning, 9.2% of the genes in rat hippocampus neurons are differentially methylated. In mice, when examined at four weeks after conditioning, the hippocampus methylations and demethylations had been reset to the original naive conditions. The hippocampus is needed to form memories, but memories are not stored there. For such mice, at four weeks after contextual fear conditioning, substantial differential CpG methylations and demethylations occurred in cortical neurons during memory maintenance, and there were 1,223 differentially methylated genes in their anterior cingulate cortex. Mechanisms guiding new DNA methylations and new DNA demethylations in the hippocampus during memory establishment were summarized in 2022. That review also indicated the mechanisms by which the new patterns of methylation gave rise to new patterns of messenger RNA expression. These new messenger RNAs were then transported by messenger RNP particles (neuronal granules) to synapses of the neurons, where they could be translated into proteins. Active changes in neuronal DNA methylation and demethylation appear to act as controllers of synaptic scaling and glutamate receptor trafficking in learning and memory formation.

==DNA methyltransferases (in mammals)==

In mammalian cells, DNA methylation occurs mainly at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides and is carried out by two general classes of enzymatic activities – maintenance methylation and &quot;de novo&quot; methylation.

Maintenance methylation activity is necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Without the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase that is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells.

It is thought that DNMT3a and DNMT3b are the &quot;de novo&quot; methyltransferases that set up DNA methylation patterns early in development. DNMT3L is a protein that is homologous to the other DNMT3s but has no catalytic activity. Instead, DNMT3L assists the &quot;de novo&quot; methyltransferases by increasing their ability to bind to DNA and stimulating their activity. Mice and rats have a third functional &quot;de novo&quot; methyltransferase enzyme named DNMT3C, which evolved as a paralog of &quot;Dnmt3b&quot; by tandem duplication in the common ancestral of Muroidea rodents. DNMT3C catalyzes the methylation of promoters of transposable elements during early spermatogenesis, an activity shown to be essential for their epigenetic repression and male fertility. It is yet unclear if in other mammals that do not have DNMT3C (like humans) rely on DNMT3B or DNMT3A for &quot;de novo&quot; methylation of transposable elements in the germline. Finally, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) has been identified as a DNA methyltransferase homolog, containing all 10 sequence motifs common to all DNA methyltransferases; however, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) does not methylate DNA but instead methylates cytosine-38 in the anticodon loop of aspartic acid transfer RNA.

Since many tumor suppressor genes are silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, there have been attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2&#x27;-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes&#x27; degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must be incorporated into the genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have led to the development of antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.

==In plants==
Significant progress has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a CpG site, in plants the cytosine can be methylated at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but not guanine. Overall, &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; DNA is highly methylated, mass spectrometry analysis estimated 14% of cytosines to be modified. Later, bisulfite sequencing data estimated that around 25% of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; CG sites are methylated, but these levels vary based on the geographic location of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; accessions (plants in the north are more highly methylated than southern accessions).

The principal &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which transfer and covalently attach methyl groups onto DNA, are DRM2, MET1, and CMT3. Both the DRM2 and MET1 proteins share significant homology to the mammalian methyltransferases DNMT3 and DNMT1, respectively, whereas the CMT3 protein is unique to the plant kingdom. There are currently two classes of DNA methyltransferases: 1) the &quot;de novo&quot; class or enzymes that create new methylation marks on the DNA; 2) a maintenance class that recognizes the methylation marks on the parental strand of DNA and transfers new methylation to the daughter strands after DNA replication. DRM2 is the only enzyme that has been implicated as a &quot;de novo&quot; DNA methyltransferase. DRM2 has also been shown, along with MET1 and CMT3 to be involved in maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication. Other DNA methyltransferases are expressed in plants but have no known function (see the Chromatin Database).

Genome-wide levels of DNA methylation vary widely between plant species, and &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; cytosines tend to be less densely methylated than those in other plants. For example, ~92.5% of CpG cytosines are methylated in &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;. The patterns of methylation also differ between cytosine sequence contexts; universally, CpG methylation is higher than CHG and CHH methylation, and CpG methylation can be found in both active genes and transposable elements, while CHG and CHH are usually relegated to silenced transposable elements.

It is not clear how the cell determines the locations of &quot;de novo&quot; DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that for many (though not all) locations, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is involved. In RdDM, specific RNA transcripts are produced from a genomic DNA template, and this RNA forms secondary structures called double-stranded RNA molecules. The double-stranded RNAs, through either the small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) pathways direct de-novo DNA methylation of the original genomic location that produced the RNA. This sort of mechanism is thought to be important in cellular defense against RNA viruses and/or transposons, both of which often form a double-stranded RNA that can be mutagenic to the host genome. By methylating their genomic locations, through an as yet poorly understood mechanism, they are shut off and are no longer active in the cell, protecting the genome from their mutagenic effect. Recently, it was described that methylation of the DNA is the main determinant of embryogenic cultures formation from explants in woody plants and is regarded the main mechanism that explains the poor response of mature explants to somatic embryogenesis in the plants (Isah 2016).

==In insects==

Diverse orders of insects show varied patterns of DNA methylation, from almost undetectable levels in flies to low levels in butterflies and higher in true bugs and some cockroaches (up to 14% of all CG sites in &quot;Blattella asahinai&quot;).

Functional DNA methylation has been discovered in Honey Bees. DNA methylation marks are mainly on the gene body, and current opinions on the function of DNA methylation is gene regulation via alternative splicing

&quot;DNA methylation levels in Drosophila melanogaster&quot; are nearly undetectable. Sensitive methods applied to Drosophila DNA Suggest levels in the range of 0.1–0.3% of total cytosine. A 2014 study of found that the low level of methylation in fruit fruit flies appeared &quot;at specific short motifs and is independent of DNMT2 activity.&quot; Further, highly sensitive mass spectrometry approaches, have now demonstrated the presence of low (0.07%) but significant levels of adenine methylation during the earliest stages of Drosophila embryogenesis.

==In fungi==

Many fungi have low levels (0.1 to 0.5%) of cytosine methylation, whereas other fungi have as much as 5% of the genome methylated. This value seems to vary both among species and among isolates of the same species. There is also evidence that DNA methylation may be involved in state-specific control of gene expression in fungi. However, at a detection limit of 250 attomoles by using ultra-high sensitive mass spectrometry DNA methylation was not confirmed in single cellular yeast species such as &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; or &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;, indicating that yeasts do not possess this DNA modification.

Although brewers&#x27; yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces&quot;), fission yeast (&quot;Schizosaccharomyces&quot;), and &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; have no detectable DNA methylation, the model filamentous fungus &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; has a well-characterized methylation system. Several genes control methylation in &quot;Neurospora&quot; and mutation of the DNA methyl transferase, &quot;dim-2&quot;, eliminates all DNA methylation but does not affect growth or sexual reproduction. While the &quot;Neurospora&quot; genome has very little repeated DNA, half of the methylation occurs in repeated DNA including transposon relics and centromeric DNA. The ability to evaluate other important phenomena in a DNA methylase-deficient genetic background makes &quot;Neurospora&quot; an important system in which to study DNA methylation.

==In other eukaryotes==

DNA methylation is largely absent from &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; where it appears to occur at about 0.006% of cytosines. In contrast, DNA methylation is widely distributed in &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; where 5-methylcytosine makes up as much as 8% of total cytosine

==In bacteria==

Adenine or cytosine methylation are mediated by restriction modification systems of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A methylase is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific restriction enzymes and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by bacteriophage.

&quot;E. coli&quot; DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) is an enzyme of ~32 kDa that does not belong to a restriction/modification system. The target recognition sequence for &quot;E. coli&quot; Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNA–Dam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the &quot;E. coli&quot; genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in an increased spontaneous mutation rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair.

One region of the DNA that keeps its hemimethylated status for longer is the origin of replication, which has an abundance of GATC sites. This is central to the bacterial mechanism for timing DNA replication. SeqA binds to the origin of replication, sequestering it and thus preventing methylation. Because hemimethylated origins of replication are inactive, this mechanism limits DNA replication to once per cell cycle.

Expression of certain genes, for example, those coding for pilus expression in &quot;E. coli&quot;, is regulated by the methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells&#x27; environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the pilus gene transcription is locked in the on or off position until the DNA is again replicated. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, these pili operons have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics.

On the other hand, DNA cytosine methylase targets CCAGG and CCTGG sites to methylate cytosine at the C5 position (C meC(A/T) GG). The other methylase enzyme, EcoKI, causes methylation of adenines in the sequences AAC(N6)GTGC and GCAC(N6)GTT.

In &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, DNA methylation at the target motif CAAAAA was shown to impact sporulation, a key step in disease transmission, as well as cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization.

===Molecular cloning===

Most strains used by molecular biologists are derivatives of &quot;E. coli&quot; K-12, and possess both Dam and Dcm, but there are commercially available strains that are dam-/dcm- (lack of activity of either methylase). In fact, it is possible to unmethylate the DNA extracted from dam+/dcm+ strains by transforming it into dam-/dcm- strains. This would help digest sequences that are not being recognized by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.

The restriction enzyme DpnI can recognize 5&#x27;-GmeATC-3&#x27; sites and digest the methylated DNA. Being such a short motif, it occurs frequently in sequences by chance, and as such its primary use for researchers is to degrade template DNA following PCRs (PCR products lack methylation, as no methylases are present in the reaction). Similarly, some commercially available restriction enzymes are sensitive to methylation at their cognate restriction sites and must as mentioned previously be used on DNA passed through a dam-/dcm- strain to allow cutting.

==Detection==

DNA methylation can be detected by the following assays currently used in scientific research:
* Mass spectrometry is a very sensitive and reliable analytical method to detect DNA methylation. MS, in general, is however not informative about the sequence context of the methylation, thus limited in studying the function of this DNA modification.
* Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP), which is based on a chemical reaction of sodium bisulfite with DNA that converts unmethylated cytosines of CpG dinucleotides to uracil or UpG, followed by traditional PCR. However, methylated cytosines will not be converted in this process, and primers are designed to overlap the CpG site of interest, which allows one to determine methylation status as methylated or unmethylated.
* Whole genome bisulfite sequencing, also known as BS-Seq, which is a high-throughput genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. It is based on the aforementioned sodium bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA, which is then sequenced on a Next-generation sequencing platform. The sequences obtained are then re-aligned to the reference genome to determine the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides based on mismatches resulting from the conversion of unmethylated cytosines into uracil.
* Enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) works similarly to bisulfite sequencing, but uses enzymes, APOBEC and TET2, to deaminate unmethylated cytosine into uracil prior to sequencing. EM-seq libraries are less prone to DNA damage than bisulfite-treated libraries.
* Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, also known as RRBS knows several working protocols. The first RRBS protocol was called RRBS and aims for around 10% of the methylome, a reference genome is needed. Later came more protocols that were able to sequence a smaller portion of the genome and higher sample multiplexing. EpiGBS was the first protocol where you could multiplex 96 samples in one lane of Illumina sequencing and were a reference genome was no longer needed. A de novo reference construction from the Watson and Crick reads made population screening of SNP&#x27;s and SMP&#x27;s simultaneously a fact.
* The HELP assay, which is based on restriction enzymes&#x27; differential ability to recognize and cleave methylated and unmethylated CpG DNA sites.
* GLAD-PCR assay, which is based on a new type of enzymes – site-specific methyl-directed DNA endonucleases, which hydrolyze only methylated DNA.
* ChIP-on-chip assays, which is based on the ability of commercially prepared antibodies to bind to DNA methylation-associated proteins like MeCP2.
* Restriction landmark genomic scanning, a complicated and now rarely used assay based upon restriction enzymes&#x27; differential recognition of methylated and unmethylated CpG sites; the assay is similar in concept to the HELP assay.
* Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP), analogous to chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunoprecipitation is used to isolate methylated DNA fragments for input into DNA detection methods such as DNA microarrays (MeDIP-chip) or DNA sequencing (MeDIP-seq).
* Pyrosequencing of bisulfite treated DNA. This is the sequencing of an amplicon made by a normal forward primer but a biotinylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide at a time to the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mismatch, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mismatch is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage of methylation per CpG island.
* Molecular break light assay for DNA adenine methyltransferase activity – an assay that relies on the specificity of the restriction enzyme DpnI for fully methylated (adenine methylation) GATC sites in an oligonucleotide labeled with a fluorophore and quencher. The adenine methyltransferase methylates the oligonucleotide making it a substrate for DpnI. Cutting of the oligonucleotide by DpnI gives rise to a fluorescence increase.
* Methyl Sensitive Southern Blotting is similar to the HELP assay, although uses Southern blotting techniques to probe gene-specific differences in methylation using restriction digests. This technique is used to evaluate local methylation near the binding site for the probe.
* MethylCpG Binding Proteins (MBPs) and fusion proteins containing just the Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) are used to separate native DNA into methylated and unmethylated fractions. The percentage methylation of individual CpG islands can be determined by quantifying the amount of the target in each fraction. Extremely sensitive detection can be achieved in FFPE tissues with abscription-based detection.
* High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRM or HRMA), is a post-PCR analytical technique. The target DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils, while methylated cytosines are preserved. PCR amplification is then carried out with primers designed to amplify both methylated and unmethylated templates. After this amplification, highly methylated DNA sequences contain a higher number of CpG sites compared to unmethylated templates, which results in a different melting temperature that can be used in quantitative methylation detection.
* Ancient DNA methylation reconstruction, a method to reconstruct high-resolution DNA methylation from ancient DNA samples. The method is based on the natural degradation processes that occur in ancient DNA: with time, methylated cytosines are degraded into thymines, whereas unmethylated cytosines are degraded into uracils. This asymmetry in degradation signals was used to reconstruct the full methylation maps of the Neanderthal and the Denisovan. In September 2019, researchers published a novel method to infer morphological traits from DNA methylation data. The authors were able to show that linking down-regulated genes to phenotypes of monogenic diseases, where one or two copies of a gene are perturbed, allows for ~85% accuracy in reconstructing anatomical traits directly from DNA methylation maps.
* Methylation Sensitive Single Nucleotide Primer Extension Assay (msSNuPE), which uses internal primers annealing straight 5&#x27; of the nucleotide to be detected.
* Illumina Methylation Assay measures locus-specific DNA methylation using array hybridization. Bisulfite-treated DNA is hybridized to probes on &quot;BeadChips.&quot; Single-base base extension with labeled probes is used to determine methylation status of target sites. In 2016, the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip was released, which interrogates over 850,000 methylation sites across the human genome.

==Differentially methylated regions (DMRs)==
Differentially methylated regions, which are genomic regions with different methylation statuses among multiple samples (tissues, cells, individuals or others), are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. The identification of DMRs among multiple tissues (T-DMRs) provides a comprehensive survey of epigenetic differences among human tissues. For example, these methylated regions that are unique to a particular tissue allow individuals to differentiate between tissue type, such as semen and vaginal fluid. Current research conducted by Lee et al., showed DACT1 and USP49 positively identified semen by examining T-DMRs. The use of T-DMRs has proven useful in the identification of various body fluids found at crime scenes. Researchers in the forensic field are currently seeking novel T-DMRs in genes to use as markers in forensic DNA analysis. DMRs between cancer and normal samples (C-DMRs) demonstrate the aberrant methylation in cancers. It is well known that DNA methylation is associated with cell differentiation and proliferation. Many DMRs have been found in the development stages (D-DMRs) and in the reprogrammed progress (R-DMRs). In addition, there are intra-individual DMRs (Intra-DMRs) with longitudinal changes in global DNA methylation along with the increase of age in a given individual. There are also inter-individual DMRs (Inter-DMRs) with different methylation patterns among multiple individuals.

QDMR (Quantitative Differentially Methylated Regions) is a quantitative approach to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy. The platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR makes it potentially applicable to various methylation data. This approach provides an effective tool for the high-throughput identification of the functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation. QDMR can be used as an effective tool for the quantification of methylation difference and identification of DMRs across multiple samples.

Gene-set analysis (a.k.a. pathway analysis; usually performed tools such as DAVID, GoSeq or GSEA) has been shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. MeDIP-seq, MeDIP-ChIP, HELP-seq etc.), and a wide range of studies have thus mistakenly reported hyper-methylation of genes related to development and differentiation; it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numbers of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.

==DNA methylation marks==
DNA methylation marks – genomic regions with specific methylation patterns in a specific biological state such as tissue, cell type, individual – are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in a cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks are associated with the cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type-specific hypomethylation.

The entropy-based Specific Methylation Analysis and Report Tool, termed &quot;SMART&quot;, which focuses on integrating a large number of DNA methylomes for the de novo identification of cell type-specific methylation marks. The latest version of SMART is focused on three main functions including de novo identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by genome segmentation, identification of DMRs from predefined regions of interest, and identification of differentially methylated CpG sites.

=== In identification and detection of body fluids ===
DNA methylation allows for several tissues to be analyzed in one assay as well as for small amounts of body fluid to be identified with the use of extracted DNA. Usually, the two approaches of DNA methylation are either methylated-sensitive restriction enzymes or treatment with sodium bisulphite. Methylated sensitive restriction enzymes work by cleaving specific CpG, cytosine and guanine separated by only one phosphate group, recognition sites when the CpG is methylated. In contrast, unmethylated cytosines are transformed to uracil and in the process, methylated cytosines remain methylated. In particular, methylation profiles can provide insight on when or how body fluids were left at crime scenes, identify the kind of body fluid, and approximate age, gender, and phenotypic characteristics of perpetrators. Research indicates various markers that can be used for DNA methylation. Deciding which marker to use for an assay is one of the first steps of the identification of body fluids. In general, markers are selected by examining prior research conducted. Identification markers that are chosen should give a positive result for one type of cell. One portion of the chromosome that is an area of focus when conducting DNA methylation are tissue-specific differentially methylated regions, T-DMRs. The degree of methylation for the T-DMRs ranges depending on the body fluid. A research team developed a marker system that is two-fold. The first marker is methylated only in the target fluid while the second is methylated in the rest of the fluids. For instance, if venous blood marker A is un-methylated and venous blood marker B is methylated in a fluid, it indicates the presence of only venous blood. In contrast, if venous blood marker A is methylated and venous blood marker B is un-methylated in some fluid, then that indicates venous blood is in a mixture of fluids. Some examples for DNA methylation markers are Mens1(menstrual blood), Spei1(saliva), and Sperm2(seminal fluid).

DNA methylation provides a relatively good means of sensitivity when identifying and detecting body fluids. In one study, only ten nanograms of a sample was necessary to ascertain successful results. DNA methylation provides a good discernment of mixed samples since it involves markers that give &quot;on or off&quot; signals. DNA methylation is not impervious to external conditions. Even under degraded conditions using the DNA methylation techniques, the markers are stable enough that there are still noticeable differences between degraded samples and control samples. Specifically, in one study, it was found that there were not any noticeable changes in methylation patterns over an extensive period of time.

The detection of DNA methylation in cell-free DNA and other body fluids has recently become one of the main approaches to Liquid biopsy. In particular, the identification of tissue-specific and disease-specific patterns allows for non-invasive detection and monitoring of diseases such as cancer. If compared to strictly genomic approaches to liquid biopsy, DNA methylation profiling offers a larger number of differentially methylated CpG sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRSs), potentially enhancing its sensitivity. Signal deconvolution algorithms based on DNA methylation have been successfully applied to cell-free DNA and can nominate the tissue of origin of cancers of unknown primary, allograft rejection, and resistance to hormone therapy.

==Computational prediction==
DNA methylation can also be detected by computational models through sophisticated algorithms and methods. Computational models can facilitate the global profiling of DNA methylation across chromosomes, and often such models are faster and cheaper to perform than biological assays. Such up-to-date computational models include Bhasin, &quot;et al.&quot;, Bock, &quot;et al&quot;., and Zheng, &quot;et al&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1186/1755-8794-6-S1-S13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Together with biological assay, these methods greatly facilitate the DNA methylation analysis.

<text>Alphonse Chapanis (March 17, 1917 – October 4, 2002) was an American pioneer in the field of industrial design, and is widely considered one of the fathers of ergonomics or human factors – the science of ensuring that design takes account of human characteristics.

==Biography==

Chapanis received a PhD in Psychology from Yale University in 1943.

He was notably active in improving aviation safety around the time of World War II, although his career covered a wide range of domains and applications.

One of his major contributions was shape coding in the aircraft cockpit. After a series of runway crashes of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Chapanis found that certain cockpit controls were confused with each other, due partly to their proximity and similarity of shape. Particularly, the controls for flaps and landing gear were confused, the consequences of which could be severe. Chapanis proposed attaching a wheel to the end of the landing gear control and a triangle to the end of the flaps control, to enable them to be easily distinguished by touch alone. Thereafter for that aircraft there were no further instances of the landing gear being mistakenly raised while the aircraft was still on the ground. This particular shape-coding of the landing gear lever is still regulated for use in civil aircraft.

In 1949 he published the first textbook on the subject of ergonomics, &quot;Applied Experimental Psychology: Human Factors in Engineering Design&quot;.

In the 1950s, Chapanis worked with Bell Labs on the design of push-button telephone handsets, conducting experiments that led to the present layout of the keys.

<text>ICF syndrome (or Immunodeficiency, Centromere instability and Facial anomalies syndrome) is a very rare autosomal recessive immune disorder.

==Presentation==
It is characterized by variable reductions in serum immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM and/or IgA) levels which cause most ICF patients to succumb to infectious diseases before adulthood. ICF syndrome patients exhibit facial anomalies which include hypertelorism, low-set ears, epicanthal folds and macroglossia. Other frequent symptoms observed in individuals with ICF syndrome include intellectual disability, recurrent and prolonged respiratory infections, and integumentary and digestive system infections.

==Genetics==

Mutations in four genes can cause this syndrome: Cell division cycle associated protein 7 (CDCA7), DNA-methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3B), Lymphoid specific helicase (HELLS) and Zinc finger- and BTB domain containing protein 24 (ZBTB24).

The CDCA7 gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q31.1).

The DNMT3B gene is located on chromosome 20 (20q11.2)).

The HELLS gene is located on chromosome 10 (10q23.33)

The ZBTB24 gene is located on chromosome 6 (6q21)

This disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis can occur using a karyotype or linkage analysis or DNA sequence analysis. This can occur prior to birth in families with a known history of the condition. 

==Treatment==
For ICF patients the most diffused therapy consists of repeated intravenous infusions of immunoglobulins for the patients entire lifespan. In 2007, Gennery et al. cured the humoral and cellular immunological defect in three ICF1 patients by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The only side effect was related to the development of autoimmune phenomena in two of them. This is the only documented case of restoring the immune conditions and growth improvement in these patients.

Lee was born in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. His father was an RCMP officer. He attended Neil McNeil High School and graduated in 1966. Before entering politics, he was a political assistant to member of Parliament (MP) Paul Cosgrove in 1982 and also Ontario Housing Minister Alvin Curling in 1985.

He is married to Ingrid Lee and has two children.

==Politics==
In 1984, he lost a nomination bid for Liberal candidacy in the old riding of York—Scarborough. In 1988, he was first elected to the House of Commons in Scarborough—Rouge River and was re-elected in every election until he retired in 2011. In the run-up to the 1993 Federal election, he was in danger of losing a nomination battle to challenger Gobinder Randhawa. However, Liberal leader Jean Chrétien intervened and designated Lee as the candidate. From 1999 to 2001 he was the parliamentary secretary to the leader of the government in the House of Commons.

During his tenure as MP, he supported judicial reform. In 1993, he tabled a private member&#x27;s bill that would have given rape victims the right to have blood samples taken from an offender.

On March 24, 2011, Lee announced he was retiring from politics. He said it was &quot;time to press the refresh button&quot; for the riding that he has represented for 23 years.

==Books==
Lee has written two books which discuss the regulations of the House of Commons:

* Matters related to the review of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner: report of the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates. (2003).
* Improving the Supreme Court of Canada appointments process: report of the Standing Committee on Justice, Human Rights, Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. (2004).

==Beliefs==
While Lee was a member of the Liberal party, he espoused social conservative viewpoints. Contrary to Liberal party policy, he expressed anti-abortion views, and also supported the death penalty. He said, &quot;I believe the death penalty should always be available to reflect the degree of society&#x27;s disgust at certain capital crimes.&quot; He also opposed same sex marriage.

Lee also received criticism for his support of the controversial Church of Scientology. Lee addressed Scientology seminars and appeared in a promotional video for the Church of Scientology. Lee identifies as a Roman Catholic and is not a member of the Church of Scientology. He once considered becoming a priest but he is no longer drawn to the Roman Catholic religion. &quot;I have done some cursory reading. I&#x27;m not personally drawn to [Catholicism], but I have to say that about many religious faiths.&quot;

<doc id="1137241" wikidata="Q159421" url="?curid=1137241" title="Savings account">
<text>A savings account is a bank account at a retail bank. Common features include a limited number of withdrawals, a lack of cheque and linked debit card facilities, limited transfer options and the inability to be overdrawn. Traditionally, transactions on savings accounts were widely recorded in a passbook, and were sometimes called passbook savings accounts, and bank statements were not provided; however, currently such transactions are commonly recorded electronically and accessible online.

People deposit funds in savings account for a variety of reasons, including a safe place to hold their cash. Savings accounts normally pay interest as well: almost all of them accrue compound interest over time. Several countries require savings accounts to be protected by deposit insurance and some countries provide a government guarantee for at least a portion of the account balance.

There are many types of savings accounts, often serving particular purposes. These may include accounts for young savers, accounts for retirees, Christmas club accounts, investment accounts, and money market accounts. Some savings accounts also have other special requirements, such as a minimum initial deposit, deposits made regularly, and notices of withdrawal.

==Regulations==
===United States===
In the United States, Sec. 204.2(d)(1) of Regulation D (FRB) previously limited withdrawals from savings accounts to six transfers or withdrawals per month, a limitation which was removed in April 2020, though some banks continue to impose a limit voluntarily as of 2021. There is no limit to the number of deposits into the account. Violations of the regulation may result in a service charge or may result in the account being changed to a checking account.

Regulation D sets smaller reserve requirements for savings account balances. In addition, customers can plan withdrawals to avoid fees and earn interest, which contributes to more stable savings account balances on which banks can lend. A savings account linked to a checking account at the same financial institution can help avoid fees due to overdrafts and reduce banking costs.

==== High yield savings accounts ====
High yield savings accounts, sometimes abbreviated to HYSA, are a type of savings account with higher interest than normal savings accounts. These accounts typically earn 10 times more in interest than a normal savings account. HYSAs can be a good option for short-term investing.

===India===
Savings accounts are very popular in India, and almost 80% of the population have one, with many having multiple savings accounts. The reserve bank has also introduced Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account which has certain limits, but allows customer to start a bank account with no minimum balance.

They were not popular among the common man until the 1920s. Savings accounts did not exist at most banks in India for a lot of time. People relied primarily on fixed deposits for preserving their savings. Canara Bank (earlier Canara Banking Corporation Limited) introduced the concept of a savings account in 1920, with a set of very rigid rules. If a customer wanted to, he could deposit a minimum of ₹1, and a maximum of ₹1000. They were not allowed to carry a balance beyond ₹2000. They had to give a notice of three days to the bank to be able to withdraw their money. The banks also enjoyed the freedom to fix the interest rate on deposits on the lowest credit balance of any one day of each month.

Banks found innovative ways of adding to their income from savings accounts. For every passbook, which was a essential physical book that the customers update to keep a record of all account transactions, the customers were asked to pay 25 paise. It is now usually given free of cost. For some time, the rate of interest on the balance in the savings account in Indian banks was regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. However, the bank can now keep any rate of interest they deem fit.

Banks have to follow the RBI&#x27;s know your customer guidelines to allow an individual to open a savings account.

Almost every bank deposit in India is insured by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), to a maximum of ₹5,00,000 or their deposit amount, whichever is lower.

<doc id="1137242" wikidata="Q3182063" url="?curid=1137242" title="John McKay (Ontario politician, born 1948)">
<text>John Norman McKay (born March 21, 1948) is a Canadian lawyer and politician. He is the Liberal Member of Parliament for the riding of Scarborough-Guildwood. McKay was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance from 2003 to 2006 during the government of Paul Martin, then served as an opposition MP and critic until November 2015 during the government of Stephen Harper. He currently serves as Chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence; Chair of the Canadian Section of the Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence; and Co-Chair of the Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group.

McKay was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on December 12, 2003, and carries the designations of &quot;Honourable&quot; and &quot;Privy Councillor&quot; (PC) for life.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, McKay has lived most of his life in Scarborough district of Toronto. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto at Scarborough and a Bachelor of Laws degree from Queen&#x27;s University. He attends an evangelical church in Toronto.

After practising private law, he was elected to represent Scarborough East in 1997 and was re-elected in 2000. In 2003 the Scarborough East riding was abolished and McKay went on to win election to the new Scarborough—Guildwood riding in 2004. McKay has been re-elected in each subsequent elections for the riding, most recently in 2021.

==Early life and career==
A lifelong resident of Scarborough, McKay went to five of the area&#x27;s public schools. He attended and graduated at Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute. McKay attended the University of Toronto Scarborough campus where he earned his Bachelor of Arts. He later earned his Bachelor of Laws from Queen&#x27;s University. After completing his degree he went into private practice as a real estate attorney, assuming positions of leadership in the legal community. Most notably, he was the President of the Durham Bar Association, an Executive Member of County and District Law Association, Real Estate Executive of the Canadian Bar Association, and a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada&#x27;s Committee on Title Insurance.

==Election to Federal Parliament==
McKay was first elected to the House of Commons in June 1997 as a Liberal during the general election of the 36th Canadian Parliament. McKay was twice elected to the former electoral district of Scarborough East, in 1997 and 2000, with 54.3 and 59.8 percent of the vote respectively. After 2000, the riding of Scarborough East was abolished and became Scarborough-Guildwood, which acquired parts of Scarborough Southwest and Scarborough Centre. McKay is the Member of Parliament for Scarborough-Guildwood and was elected as the representative for the riding in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2021 with 57.5, 53.3, 50.2, 36.2, 60.0, 61, and again with 61 percent of the vote respectively.

==Parliamentary experience==

===Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance===
From 2003 to 2006, McKay served as Parliamentary Secretary to then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale. Paul Martin, during his tenure as Prime Minister, implemented a number of reforms aimed at making parliament more democratic. One of these reforms gave greater authority to MPs serving as Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister, in contrast to their previous role that had been largely clerical with little purview over government policy. To this end, McKay was given ministerial responsibility for the improvement of partnerships between the public and private sectors.

During the 2003–2006 period the Ministry of Finance tabled two consecutive balanced budgets and implemented its productivity strategy, aimed at improving economic growth through innovation, elimination of domestic trade barriers, competitive taxes, and improved infrastructure among other initiatives.

===Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence===
Between 2015 and 2019 McKay served as the Parliamentary Secretary to then Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan.

===Critic portfolios===
McKay served as the Critic for the Environment for the Liberal Party of Canada during the government of Steven Harper He was appointed to the role by Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau on August 21, 2013. His positions include:

* Liberal Party of Canada Critic for Environment – 2013–2015
* Liberal Party of Canada Critic for Defence – 2011–2013
* Official Opposition Critic for Small Business and Tourism – 2008
* Official Opposition Critic for Crown Corporations – 2006

===Committees===
McKay was the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights (2001–2003), Member of the Standing Committee of Finance (2004–2011), Chair of the Standing Committee on Government Operations (2011–2012), and vice-chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence (2011–2013). He was a member of the Standing Committee on Environment from 2013 to 2015. Currently (April 2019), he serves as Chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security; Chair of the Canadian Section of the Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence; and vice-president of the Canada-United Kingdom Inter-Parliamentary Association, along with membership in several other groups and committees.

===Other Parliamentary experience===

* Vice-chair of Canada-U.S Inter-Parliamentary Association – Present
* Chair of the Liberal Caucus Committee on Economic Prosperity - 2007–2008
* Chair of the Canada-Caribbean Parliamentary Friendship Group – 2006
* Head of Canadian delegation at Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting - Barbados 2005, St. Kitts 2004
* Chair of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group from 2001 to 2004
* Head of Canadian delegation to Taiwan 2003

==Successful Private Members’ Bills==
McKay has successfully sponsored two Private Members&#x27; Bills during his tenure as a Member of Parliament:

* C-260, passed in 2003, requires cigarette manufacturers to produce ‘fire-safe’ cigarettes (cigarettes that extinguish when left unattended, reducing their flammability).
* C-293, passed in 2008, outlines specific requirements for the disbursement of Canadian foreign aid. The Bill requires that Canadian foreign aid be exclusively targeted toward the goal of poverty reduction, and requires timely and transparent reporting of how such funds are spent.

Private Members&#x27; Bills rarely receive Royal Assent as most bills originate from the cabinet of the party controlling the most seats (the party in government).

===An Act to amend the Hazardous Products Act (fire-safe cigarettes) - C-260===
In 2002 McKay introduced Bill C-260, an amendment to the already existing Hazardous Products Act, which forces tobacco manufacturers to produce fire safe cigarettes in response to the threat of fire posed by cigarettes left unattended. The Bill requires that cigarettes meet regulated ignition propensity standards (RIPs) by law and provide evidence to the Minister of Health of compliance with the regulation. As of October 1, 2005, all cigarettes in Canada are manufactured to self-extinguish before burning to the cigarette filter, thus reducing the risk that it will start a fire when forgotten or when the smoker falls asleep.

Prior to the C-260, the Canadian Ministry of Health estimated that unattended cigarettes resulted in 2085 fires, 70 deaths and $28.1 million in damages to property. Health Canada further estimated that RIP cigarettes would prevent 34-68% of fire loss damages.

After C-260 received Royal Assent in 2003, Canada became the first country to introduce nationwide ignition propensity regulations on cigarettes, and has become an example used by advocacy groups in other nations for the imposition of such regulations.

===The Development Assistance Accountability Act - C-293===
In 2006 McKay introduced Private Members’ Bill C-293, which called for significant changes to the manner in which Canada&#x27;s official development assistance is delivered and administered. Often referred to as the ‘Better Aid Bill,’ its primary purpose is to mandate that the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) target Canada&#x27;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the specific goal of poverty reduction in developing nations.

Prior to the passage of C-293, parliamentary committees and NGOs had called for a clearer mandate for ODA. Critics of Canada&#x27;s aid spending noted that assistance was often sent to countries that have recently experienced strong economic growth and prosperity or have dubious records regarding human rights. In an article from 19 June 2007, National Post columnist John Ivison reported that Canada had sent $7.7 million to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for job creation programs and reconciliation projects, despite the country&#x27;s healthy economy, lower taxation rate and higher per capita GDP. In another example, Ivison noted that in 2004-2005 China received $57 million in ODA, amid concerns held by the international community about human rights abuses.

The Bill established a set of principles that CIDA must take into account when adjudging how aid is to be spent. First, it requires that the perspectives and concerns of those who receive ODA be taken into account. This means that Canadian aid flows will have to respect the priorities of its beneficiaries - the people living in poverty. Secondly, it requires that ODA be promulgated in a manner consistent with Canadian values and foreign policy, sustainable development, and the promotion of democracy and human rights. The Bill also requires that Canadian foreign aid spending be more transparent and accountable to Parliament and must be reported in a timely manner.

Due to the legislated focus on long-term poverty reduction, ODA cannot be redirected towards international military efforts or short-term disaster relief (areas of policy that the Canadian government must fund separately) and is subject to judicial review and oversight by the Minister.

Senator Roméo Dallaire moved third reading of C-293 in the Senate. Senator Dallaire hailed the Bill saying: &quot;My colleague in the other place, the Honourable John McKay, introduced Bill C-293 in the House of Commons in May 2006, almost two years ago. It has come a long way since then and has been put through many valuable and essential debates. I believe the debates initiated by Bill C-293 were so important that they will inform the nature of any future essential international development policy and legislation in this country. It is a first step.&quot;

On 20 March 2008, C-293 passed third reading in the House of Commons with unanimous support from all parties. It received Royal Assent on May 29, 2008, thus becoming law as the Development Assistance Accountability Act, (An Act respecting the provision of official development assistance abroad).

Canada&#x27;s Development Assistance Accountability Act represents a trend among other nations that provide foreign aid toward legislated mandates for the provision of foreign aid. In 2002 the U.K. passed the International Development Act that entrenched poverty reduction as the preponderant focus of its foreign aid. Other countries with similar legislation include Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark and Belgium.

McKay is one of the more active Members of the Canadian Parliament on the issue of aid to developing nations, having been the Vice President of CIDO; an organization devoted the development of microfinancing in developing nations. In 2007 McKay travelled with Michael Savage M.P. (Liberal), Alexa McDonough M.P. (NDP), and Bill Casey M.P. (Conservative) to Kenya as part of a Parliamentary envoy to assess the efficacy and potential of ODA in developing nations. Though C-293 had been introduced prior to the trip, according to McKay the Kenyan sojourn gave greater urgency to the need for ODA reform. &quot;We did not come away with easy answers regarding development and poverty, but a much clearer sense that we do have the capacity for meaningful change.&quot;

C-293 has received praise from a diverse array of groups and organizations including Canada&#x27;s Coalition to End Global Poverty,
Make Poverty History, Engineers without Borders and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada.

==&quot;The Responsible Mining Bill&quot; - Private Members&#x27; Bill C-300==

===Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act - Bill C-300===
On February 9, 2009, John McKay introduced his latest Private Member&#x27;s Bill C- 300 to the House of Commons. The Bill was defeated on 26 October 2010, during its third reading.

Bill C- 300, also cited as the Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act, has the stated purpose of promoting &quot;environmental best practices and to ensure the protection and promotion of international human rights standards in respect of the mining, oil or gas activities of Canadian corporations in developing countries&quot;. The Act would require the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of International Trade to investigate and report on any single complaint against the activities of a Canadian extractive sector company in a developing country. The Ministers could also investigate matters on their own initiative. The Ministers would publish the results of any specific investigation, and submit annual reports of activities carried out under the Act to the House of Commons and the Senate for review. The Act would also amend the laws governing Export Development Canada, the Canada Pension Plan, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, to require those organizations to withdraw financial support and consular support from companies acting &quot;inconsistently&quot; with corporate social responsibility (CSR) Guidelines. McKay has stated that the intent of the bill is that these investigations be carried out within the existing organization and with the existing personnel available to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of International Trade.

Said McKay: &quot;NGOs and government officials who have expressed concerns about the practices of some mining, oil, and gas operations in developing countries will be encouraged by Bill C-300. This Bill will provide strong incentives for Canadian corporations in developing countries to follow environmental and human rights standards.&quot;

However, the intended and actual scope and impact of the Bill is not clear. John McKay sometimes characterizes the bill as a modest law that would merely ensure that the Canadian government does not directly support extractive industry companies that do not adhere to CSR standards. However, it appears that the law would oblige or empower (oblige in response to a complaint, empower if they believe warranted) the Ministers to investigate and report on any Canadian mining or oil company regardless of whether it was currently receiving support – so the potential sanction of government condemnation would apply to any extractive industry company, if one of the Ministers decides it is not acting consistently with the CSR guidelines.

C-300 is not without controversy. While there has been no disagreement with the bill&#x27;s stated intent in continuing to improve Canada&#x27;s performance in CSR, many groups argue that the bill has flaws that would prevent it from achieving its objective. The mechanism of the bill is not aimed at changing the CSR performance of projects in developing countries, only from dissuading Canadian companies from initiating or maintaining investments in projects that may be found inconsistent with the CSR Guidelines. John McKay has used Talisman Energy divesting of its share of a venture in Sudan as an example of how it would be feasible for Canadian companies to comply with the bill. While this did eliminate Talisman&#x27;s exposure to the poor CSR performance of that venture, there is evidence that this actually reduced CSR performance in Sudan by eliminating Talisman&#x27;s advocacy for CSR measures. This approach contrasts to the National Roundtables on CSR 2007 Advisory Group&#x27;s recommendations, and the current government initiatives, that are aimed at supporting and enforcing improved performance in the developing world.

Export Development Canada (EDC) would be required to withdraw even existing financing from a company that has been found in a Ministerial investigation to have activities inconsistent with the guidelines to be established under Bill C-300. EDC notes that they currently conduct CRS assessments of financings in sensitive markets or for sensitive projects, and work with companies to ensure that required standards are met before receiving EDC support. EDC believes that by working with companies to resolve CSR issues they contribute more to CSR than if they were forced to exit the relationship as soon as the guidelines are not met. EDC&#x27;s support in this sector helped generate $21.4 billion in Canadian GDP and sustain 139,000 Canadian jobs in communities across the country and this might be in jeopardy if Bill C-300 were to become law.

Representatives of the mining industry also note that key stakeholders were not consulted in the development of the bill, and is not in keeping with the spirit and intent of the recommendations of the National Roundtable on CSR. Representatives of the legal community in Canada and the extractive industry have noted that C-300 is problematic in several ways, including Canada&#x27;s capacity, expertise or jurisdiction to enforce CSR guidelines abroad or to supersede local authorities. It also forces the Canadian government into a punitive approach, rather than allowing the government to assist companies is resolving CSR issues.

As is evidenced through public statements and media appearances, Bill C-300&#x27;s critics represent a wide array of extractive industry and business interests. However, Bill C-300 is also supported by a wide array of public academics, and NGOs both internationally and within Canada. Supporters of the Bill include (but are not limited to): Amnesty International, the Halifax Initiative, Make Poverty History, MiningWatch Canada, Africa Files, World Vision, The North-South Institute, Canadian Labour Congress, Development and Peace (Canada), Ecojustice Canada, Rights and Democracy, Social Justice Committee of Montreal, and Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. Various private individuals and foreign governments have weighed-in both as supporters and as critics of the Bill.

Professor Richard Janda of the McGill University Faculty of Law produced a report entitled, &quot;Bill C-300: Sound and Measured Reinforcement for CSR.&quot; According to Professor Janda Bill C-300 would make Canadian companies world leaders in CSR, and that good CSR performance would give Canadian extractive companies a competitive edge and international business advantage. Industry submissions agree that good CSR performance is generally a source of competitive advantage. Professor Janda&#x27;s report does not examine the current position of Canadian companies and CSR, nor does it examine whether C-300 is required in order to make Canadian companies world leaders, both which are beyond the scope of the report. However, John McKay has stated that Canadian companies already have a competitive advantage in some developing countries because they are held to higher standards of practice and more likely to fulfill licensing conditions. Essentially, there is agreement that CSR is important, and that Canada is already in many ways a strong player - the debate is whether C-300 will improve CSR performance, and if so whether it is the most appropriate way to do so.

An important difference between the basis of Professor Janda&#x27;s conclusions and the concerns of industry is the presumption of how easy, or not, it will be for the Minister receiving a complaint to determine if it is &quot;frivolous or vexatious&quot;. Professor Janda states that &quot;the general requirement that a complaint appear to be reasonable on its face is nevertheless sufficiently stringent to allow the Minister in question efficiently to screen out complaints that are frivolous and vexatious&quot;, whereas industry representatives state that this will not be an easy determination, given that the complaints will likely relate to activities in remote areas and particularly if the complaint comes from an individual outside of Canada (in a developing country).

A second important difference in the view of the Janda report and submissions from industry and other members of the legal community is the presumption of how complaints will be investigated. Professor Janda refers to the legality in Canada for the Canadian government to hear evidence from &quot;witnesses abroad&quot;, and gives examples of foreign fact-finding related to assistance in natural disasters to coordinate relief efforts. However, he does not address the practicality or legality of investigating matters related to breaches of laws in foreign countries, which may include investigation of the actions of the foreign government. Submissions critical of C-300 point out that many of the various allegations made against Canadian companies also imply breaches of law in the host country, or include accusations against the police or military of the host country, or challenge the conformity of host country laws with international standards (such as for recognition of indigenous peoples) - and that these would likely be difficult to investigate from Canada, or for the Canadian government to investigate in the host country.

The Janda report also finds Bill C-300 is consistent with the National Roundtables Advisory Group&#x27;s recommendations, with an even more modest set of proposals. However, this is based on examination of the 6 &quot;major components&quot; of the proposed Canadian CSR Framework, which is a central recommendation in the Advisory Group report, rather than the 26 specific recommendations contained in the Advisory Group report. In fact, the Bill does not reflect any of the specific recommendations of the Roundtables, although it is frequently referenced to the Ombudsman called for in the Roundtable recommendations. Supporters of C-300 state that the Bill is a better representation of the Ombudsman than the recently created Office of the Extractive Sector CSR Counsellor, because C-300 can force investigations and impose sanctions. However, the Ombudsman office described in the recommendations was not to have the power to impose sanctions, it was proposed to &quot;provide advisory, fact-finding and reporting functions&quot;. A separate &quot;standing tripartite Compliance Review Committee&quot; (presumably representing government, business, and civil society) was proposed that, in cases of serious non-compliance, would make recommendations with regard to the &quot;withdrawal of financial and/or nonfinancial services&quot; by the government.

The Janda report rebuts further criticism by claiming Bill C-300&#x27;s direct effects to be within federal jurisdiction, and therefore, not extraterritorial. However, this opinion does not address the legitimacy of the Canadian government investigating allegations related to the activities of foreign governments, nor investigation of crimes (other than &quot;crimes of universal jurisdiction&quot;) occurring in foreign countries, nor investigation of the activities of foreign nationals working in their home country. As noted above, critics of the bill point out that allegations that have been presented as justification for the bill would require these sorts of extraterritorial investigations. The Janda report insists that Bill C-300&#x27;s expectations on Canadian corporations have a strong legal foundation.

Bill C-300 supporters claim that since the mining companies receive investment from Export Development Canada (EDC), which is funded by Canadian taxpayers, and Canadian Pension Plan (CPP) their actions ought to be transparent and accountable to Canadians. The submissions critical of C-300 do not argue against this principle, and have noted that the existing CSR Commitment of EDC, and CPP Policies and Reports on Responsible Investing currently provide at least a measure of such transparency and accountability. Additionally, C-300 does not include any of the transparency measures included in the recommendations of the National Roundtables 2007 Advisory Group report - many of which would not require government expenditure and therefore would be suitable for a Private Member&#x27;s Bill.

==&quot;The Sunshine Bill&quot; – Bill C-474==

On February 26, 2013, McKay tabled Bill C-474, or &quot;The Sunshine Bill,&quot; borrowing from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Bradeis’ famous phrase on transparency, &#x27;sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.&#x27;

Responding to allegations of corrupt corporate payments made to foreign entities, the bill would have required Canadian extractive sector companies to submit an audited, annual transparency report to the Government of Canada disclosing all payments to foreign governments. The bill would also have given the Government of Canada the power to conduct investigations of payments to foreign governments, as well as levy a fine of up to $5 million and allow for complaints to be tried in a court with jurisdiction over the company.

According to McKay, &quot;the Sunshine Bill&quot; was modelled on the United States’ Cardin-Lugar amendment (2016) to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform &amp; Consumer Protection Act that required oil, gas, and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments or potentially be de-listed from U.S. stock exchanges.

As noted by CNBC: &quot;The goal is to prevent foreign leaders from skimming off the payments that drillers and miners make to their countries. Such corruption, which enriches the politically connected but deprives regular people of their country’s mineral wealth, is known as the ‘resource curse.’&quot;

Said McKay in the House of Commons on May 24, 2013: &quot;This is serious stuff. The common pattern is the conviction gets registered, the officials get fired, the stock gets hammered, so there is a bunch of unhappy people and the most unhappy of all are the shareholders. All of us are shareholders in many of these companies because they are all on the TSX and our Canada pension plan has large holdings on many of these companies.&quot;

He continued in a speech on January 31, 2014: &quot;The best companies operate at the highest ethical standards, but they are frankly helpless when less ethical companies bribe their way into lucrative concessions… (i)t frustrates the CEOs who want to do the right thing. It makes him or her unnecessarily vulnerable and, frankly, it trashes Canada&#x27;s reputation.&quot;

While McKay’s &quot;Sunshine Bill&quot; was defeated by the Conservatives under Prime Minister Stephen Harper on April 9, 2014, the Harper government later adopted a similar measure in C-43, the omnibus budget implementation act, introduced on October 23, 2014 as the Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act.

The Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act requires, oil, gas, and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign entities. Penalties for offenses under the Act include fines and the potential for summary conviction.

==&quot;The Modern Slavery Act&quot; – Bill C-423==

===&quot;Ending the Use of All Forms of Child Labour in Supply Chains&quot; – Report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development===
In October of 2018 McKay participated in the House of Commons Subcommittee on International Human Rights study on child labour and modern slavery that resulted in &quot;A Call to Action: Ending the Use of All Forms of Child Labour in Supply Chains.&quot; The Committee released a set of recommendations for the Government of Canada on how to reduce child labour in supply chains.

The Committee concludes the report by calling on the Government of Canada to take action against the use of child and forced labour in supply chains, arguing that taking concerted international action to implement the recommendations of the subcommittee is the best way to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating all forms of child labour worldwide. As a result of the report, the Government of Canada began to explore legislation to stop child and forced labour in supply chains.

===Bill C-423===
Bill C-423, or The Modern Slavery Act, was introduced by McKay in December 2018 following the committee report released in October saying &quot;(t)his bill gives an opportunity for consumers to know whether, in fact, anywhere along the supply chain of the product they are buying or the service they are using, slave or forced labour conditions applied.&quot;

The purpose of the Modern Slavery Act is to implement Canada&#x27;s international commitment to confirm supply chain transparency and contribute to the fight against modern slavery. The Act requires companies that have assets over CAD $20 million and revenue over CAD $40 million to ensure that their supply chains are transparent and free of goods produced by slavery if they wish to do business in Canada. If passed, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness through the Canadian Border Services Agency could impose an import ban on goods or materials partially or fully produced by forced labour. Entities found to have imported tainted goods can be subjected to a fine of up to CAD $250,000. This is in addition to the reputational damages, which often far exceeds the costs of fines or import bans. However, Bill C-423 did not proceed in the House of Commons due to the 2019 Federal Election.

===All Party Parliamentary Group to End Modern Slavery===
Following the 2019 Federal Election, McKay continued his work on modern slavery legislation with the All-Party Parliamentary Group to End Modern Slavery as a co-chair. Senator Julie Miville-Deschene, a co-chair of the APPG, introduced S-216 into the Senate in February 2020. S-216 was initially introduced into the House of Commons as McKay&#x27;s Private Members Bill C-423.

During the 2021 Federal Election, the Liberal and Conservative Parties of Canada outlined platform commitments for supply chain legislation to end modern slavery in Canadian supply chains. The APPG is expected to introduce a third version of the bill once the 44th parliament resumes.

==Conservation efforts==

From 1998 to 2000, McKay represented the Federal Government as a board member on the Rouge Park Alliance, a group of government representatives and community leaders dedicated to the conservation, ecological protection, and enhancement of the Rouge River watershed and lakefront areas (The former riding of Scarborough East bordered on the Rouge River area). McKay has also helped with efforts to extend the Waterfront Trail along parts of the Scarborough shoreline and enhance its public accessibility.

==Miscellaneous==
McKay is a leading social conservative in the Liberal Party. He strongly opposed his own party&#x27;s bill which legalised same-sex marriage in Canada in 2005. McKay is a past board member of the Doris McCarthy Gallery at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus.

<doc id="1137252" wikidata="Q1018612" url="?curid=1137252" title="Byron Janis">
<text>Byron Janis (né Yanks; March 24, 1928 – March 14, 2024) was an American classical pianist. He made numerous recordings for RCA Victor and Mercury Records, and occupies two volumes of the Philips series &quot;Great Pianists of the 20th Century&quot;. His discography covered repertoire from Bach to David W. Guion and included major piano concertos from Mozart to Rachmaninoff and Liszt to Prokofiev.

==Biography==
Janis was born Byron Yanks in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, on March 24, 1928, the younger of two children of Hattie Horelick and Samuel Yankilevitch, who had shortened his surname to Yanks after emigrating to America, before finally setting on the surname Janis. His parents were Russian Jews. After demonstrating perfect pitch on a toy xylophone in kindergarten, Janis studied with Abraham Litow until he was 8 years old. Byron moved to New York with his mother and sister in 1936 to study with Josef and Rosina Lhévinne, and a year later, he began studying with their associate, Adele Marcus, who would remain his teacher for six years. When Marcus moved to Dallas in 1941, Yanks followed her there to continue his piano studies. He remained in Texas for three years, attending Woodrow Wilson High School. Byron Yanks made his recital debut in 1937 at the Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh, and a year later, his musical sponsor, Samuel Chotzinoff, persuaded him to change his name to Byron Jannes; he would later change the spelling to Janis.

After attending one of Janis&#x27; concerts in Pittsburgh in 1944, at which he played Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Concerto No. 2, Vladimir Horowitz offered to take the fifteen-year-old on as his first pupil. Janis studied with Horowitz from 1944 until 1948. Horowitz had advised Janis to concertize to build self-confidence and stage presence, so he postponed his successful Carnegie Hall debut until 1948.

Janis was also a composer. He wrote music for musical theater, including the score for a 1993 Off-Broadway adaptation of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, for television shows, and in collaboration on several pieces with Cy Coleman.

In 1967, Janis accidentally unearthed what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;That rarest of all musical items...&quot;, two previously unknown manuscripts of published Chopin waltzes (Op. 18 and Op. 70, No. 1) at the Chateau de Thoiry in France. Several years later, Janis found the same two waltzes in different versions at Yale University. These manuscripts were published together in the 1978 book &quot;The Most Dramatic Musical Discovery of the Age&quot;.

In 1973, Janis developed severe arthritis in both hands and wrists. In 1985, he talked about his difficulties in public for the first time and became the First Ambassador for the Arthritis Foundation. In June 2012, he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work in Arthritis Advocacy.

Janis and his wife, Maria Cooper, daughter of screen actor Gary Cooper, wrote his autobiography &quot;Chopin and Beyond: My Extraordinary Life in Music and the Paranormal&quot;, which was released in 2010. Sony also released an eleven-CD set in 2011 which reissued the LPs he made for RCA and Mercury Records during the 1950s and 1960s. In the DVD &quot;A Voyage With Byron Janis&quot;, he hosts a musical journey through Chopin&#x27;s life. In 2016, it was reported that Martin Scorsese was developing a Byron Janis biopic for Paramount Pictures from a script by Peter Glanz, adapted from Janis&#x27; autobiography.

Janis died at a hospital in Manhattan, New York, on March 14, 2024, at the age of 95.

==Honors==

Janis received several awards and honors including: 
* Commander of the French Légion d&#x27;Honneur for Arts and Letters
* Grand Prix du Disque
* Stanford Fellowship, the highest honor of Yale University 
* Distinguished Pennsylvania Artist Award

He received an honorary doctorate at Trinity College and the gold medal from the French Society for the Encouragement of Progress, the first musician to receive this honor since its inception in 1906. He was invited six times by four sitting Presidents to perform at the White House and was written into the Congressional Record of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, honoring him as &quot;a musician, a diplomat and an inspiration.&quot; He was featured in the PBS documentary, by Emmy-award-winning producer Peter Rosen, &quot;The Byron Janis Story&quot;, which highlighted his struggles with arthritis.

<text>Vincennes Bay is a large V-shaped bay, 105 km (65 mi) wide at its entrance between Cape Nutt and Cape Folger in Antarctica, marked by several large, steep glaciers near its head, lying along Knox and Budd Coasts. It was photographed from the air by US Navy Operation Highjump in 1946–47. The bay was entered in January 1948 by US Navy Operation Windmill icebreakers Burton Island and stations in the Windmill Islands in the NE portion of the bay. Named by the US-ACAN for the sloop of war , flagship of the USEE under Wilkes, from which a series of coastal landfalls along Wilkes Land were discovered and plotted during January–February 1840. Wilkes&#x27; chart suggests a possible coastal recession corresponding closely with the longitudinal limits for Vincennes Bay, although pack ice conditions prevented close reconnaissance by the USEE of the coast in this immediate area.

Vincennes Bay is roughly triangular, 120 km north–south and 150 km east–west at its northern extremity, and thus covers an area of about 9,000 km2. To the east lies the icecap of Law Dome and the north–south oriented Windmill Islands coast of Precambrian basement, which is the setting for Antarctic stations Wilkes (USA, 1957–59) and Casey (Australia, 1959–present day). The Knox Coast forms the western boundary of Vincennes Bay, where the East Antarctic ice sheet terminates in continuous ice cliffs. The southern coastline of Vincennes Bay is marked by the Vanderford and Adams Glaciers. The Vanderford Glacier drains the western hemisphere of Law Dome and together with the Adams Glacier, drains the main East Antarctic ice sheet via the Aurora subglacial basin, a major feature of East Antarctica. Petersen Bank (&lt;200 m) is located on the eastern side of the bay and another shallow bank is located on the western side; however, much of Vincennes Bay lies deeper than 1000 m below sea level.

Glacial erosion has produced an over-deepened glacial trough on the inner shelf, up to 2,100 m in depth locally, and most of the inner shelf area is characterised by exposed basement rocks as seen on GI-gun seismic profiles. Glacial marine sedimentation processes in the bay are characterised by siliciclastic sediments dominating over biogenic sediments even in deep, inner shelf troughs. Water circulation in the Bay involves landward flow at depth, bringing warmer ocean water into contact with the base of the Vanderford Glacier. This water becomes mixed with fresh meltwater and suspended glacial sediments to form a buoyant plume that rises and flows in a seaward direction under the ice shelf.

Brooks Point is a rock headland on its western shore.

<text>The Canadian Opera Company (COC) is an opera company in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the largest opera company in Canada and one of the largest producers of opera in North America. The COC performs at the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, which was purpose-built for opera and ballet and is shared with the National Ballet of Canada. For forty years until April 2006, the COC had performed at the O&#x27;Keefe Centre (now known as Meridian Hall).

==History==

Nicholas Goldschmidt and Herman Geiger-Torel founded the organization in 1950 as the Royal Conservatory Opera Company. Geiger-Torel became the COC&#x27;s artistic director in 1956 and its general director in 1960. The company was renamed the Canadian Opera Association in 1960, and the Canadian Opera Company in 1977. Geiger-Torel retired from the general directorship in 1976. Lotfi Mansouri was the COC&#x27;s general director from 1976 to 1988. In 1983, the COC introduced surtitles (supertitles) to their productions, the first company to use them in an opera house. Productions included Joan Sutherland&#x27;s first performance of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;.

Brian Dickie served as the COC&#x27;s general director from 1988 to 1993. Dickie named Richard Bradshaw the COC&#x27;s chief conductor and head of music in 1989. Elaine Calder was the COC&#x27;s general director from 1994 to 1997. In 1998, Bradshaw was named general director. During his tenure, Bradshaw secured funding for the COC&#x27;s new permanent home, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts. Previously, the COC had been performing at the O&#x27;Keefe Centre (renamed to the Hummingbird Centre and then the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts).

In 2006, the COC opened its new opera house with an all-new production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. Michael Levine was the designer, and there were four directors: Michael Levine (&quot;Das Rheingold&quot;), Atom Egoyan (&quot;Die Walküre&quot;), François Girard (&quot;Siegfried&quot;), and Tim Albery (&quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;).

In 2006, Bradshaw&#x27;s contract as general director was renewed for another 10 years. Bradshaw died of a sudden heart attack on August 15, 2007. In June 2008, Alexander Neef was named the COC&#x27;s general director; he formally assumed the position in October 2008. In October 2008, Johannes Debus made his debut with the COC as a conductor in a production of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, where he earned critical acclaim. In January 2009, the COC announced Debus&#x27;s appointment as music director. Sandra Horst, who runs the University of Toronto&#x27;s Opera Division, has long served as the company&#x27;s chorus master.

The 2019/2020 COC theatre season was cut short due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on which the COC ceased all productions after March 2020 due to restrictions on large indoor gatherings. The COC hoped to restart the shortened 2020/2021 theatre season by January 2021, however on October 6, 2020, company management announced that the entire 2020/2021 COC theatre season was cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic.

Neef became director general of the Paris Opera in September 2020 and was replaced by Briton Perryn Leech in March 2021. In June 2024, Perryn Leech left and was replaced as general director by David C. Ferguson, a retired banker and accountant.

<text>The Act of Uniformity 1558 was an Act of the Parliament of England, passed in 1559, to regularise prayer, divine worship and the administration of the sacraments in the Church of England. In so doing, it mandated worship according to the attached 1559 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The Act was part of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement in England instituted by Elizabeth I, who wanted to unify the church. Other Acts concerned with this settlement were the Act of Supremacy 1558 and the Thirty-Nine Articles.

==Background==
Elizabeth was trying to achieve a settlement after 30 years of turmoil during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I, during which England had swung from Roman Catholicism to Protestantism and back to Catholicism. The outcome of the Elizabethan Settlement was a sometimes tense and often fragile union of High Church and Low Church elements within the Church of England and Anglicanism worldwide.

== The Act ==
The Act set the order of prayer to be used in the 1559 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. All persons had to attend Anglican services once a week or be fined 12 pence (equal to about three days wages or around £24 today).

==Repeal==
On 27 September 1650, the Act was repealed by the Rump Parliament of the Commonwealth of England with the &quot;Act for the Repeal of several Clauses in Statutes imposing Penalties for not coming to Church&quot;, but this Act was rendered null and void with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Most of the Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1888.

<text>Campbell Island / Motu Ihupuku is an uninhabited subantarctic island of New Zealand, and the main island of the Campbell Island group. It covers of the group&#x27;s , and is surrounded by numerous stacks, rocks and islets like Dent Island, Folly Island (or Folly Islands), Isle de Jeanette-Marie, and Jacquemart Island, the latter being the southernmost extremity of New Zealand. The island is mountainous, rising to over in the south. A long fiord, Perseverance Harbour, nearly bisects it, opening out to sea on the east coast.

The island is listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The island is an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district, but instead &quot;Area Outside Territorial Authority&quot;, like all other outlying islands, other than the Solander Islands. It is the closest piece of land to the antipodal point of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the city furthest away is Limerick, Ireland.

Campbell Island was gazetted as a nature reserve in 1954, and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998 as part of the designation of all of the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands.

==History==
Campbell Island was discovered in 1810 by Captain Frederick Hasselborough of the sealing brig &quot;Perseverance&quot;, which was owned by shipowner Robert Campbell&#x27;s Sydney-based company Campbell &amp; Co. (whence the island&#x27;s name). Captain Hasselborough drowned on 4 November 1810 in Perseverance Harbour on the south of the island, along with a young woman and a boy.

The island became a seal hunting base, and the seal population was almost totally eradicated. The first sealing boom was over by the mid-1810s. The second was a brief revival in the 1820s. The sealing era lasted from 1810 till 1912 during which time 49 vessels are recorded visiting for sealing purposes, one of which was lost off the coast.

The whaling boom extended here in the 1830s and &#x27;40s. In 1874, the island was visited by a French scientific expedition intending to view the transit of Venus. Much of the island&#x27;s topography is named after aspects of, or people connected with, the expedition.
In December 1840 Campbell Island was the last landfall before the Ross expedition explored the Antarctic.

In 1883 the American schooner &quot;Sarah W. Hunt&quot;, a whaler, was near Campbell Island. Twelve men in two small whaleboats headed for the island in terrible weather looking for seals. One of the boats disappeared, and the other boat with six men aboard managed to make it ashore. Sanford Miner, the captain of the &quot;Sarah W. Hunt&quot;, assumed all the whalers were lost, and sailed away to Lyttelton, New Zealand. Fortunately for the stranded whalers, a seal protection boat, the &quot;Kekeno&quot;, happened to arrive at the island, and rescued the castaways. The captain&#x27;s behaviour caused an international scandal.

In the late 19th century, the island became a pastoral lease. Sheep farming was undertaken from 1896 until the lease, along with the sheep and a small herd of cattle, was abandoned in 1931 because of the Great Depression.

In 1907, a group of scientists spent eight days on the island group surveying. The 1907 Sub-Antarctic Islands Scientific Expedition conducted a magnetic survey and also took botanical, zoological and geological specimens.

During World War II, a coastwatching station was operative at Tucker Cove at the north shore of Perseverance Harbour as part of the Cape Expedition program.

In 1992, a Campbell Island scene was incorporated into the reverse side design of the New Zealand five-dollar note in the fifth series of New Zealand bank notes. The scene includes a yellow-eyed penguin or &quot;hoiho&quot; (&quot;Megadyptes antipodes&quot;), a subantarctic lily (&quot;Bulbinella rossii&quot;), a daisy (&quot;Pleurophyllum speciosum&quot;), and bull kelp or &quot;rimurapa&quot; (&quot;Durvillaea antarctica&quot;).

Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the island was officially altered to Campbell Island / Motu Ihupuku.

An amateur radio DXpedition organised by the Hellenic Amateur Radio Association of Australia visited Campbell Island during November–December 2012. The team consisted of ten amateur radio operators from around the world, a NZ Department of Conservation Officer, and the ship&#x27;s crew of six, including the captain, on the sailing vessel &quot;Evohe&quot;. The ZL9HR DXpedition team made 42,922 on-air contacts during an eight-day operating period.

== Weather station ==

After World War II, the coast watching station at Tucker Cove was converted for use as a meteorological station until the summer of 1958, when a new base was established at Beeman Cove, a few hundred metres further east. The new location provided improved exposure for the weather instruments, particularly wind recordings, and more modern accommodation for up to 12 full-time staff.

The new meteorological station (WMO ID 93944) at Beeman Cove was operated by the New Zealand Meteorological Service with ten full-time staff. Each team undertook 12-month expeditions to the island to undertake three hourly weather reports and twice daily radiosonde flights using hydrogen filled balloons. Weather reports were radioed back to New Zealand using HF radio to ZLW Wellington Radio. In addition to its primary purpose as a meteorological station, staff at the station also operated a seismic monitoring station, made measurements of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, the ionosphere, and aurora australis, and undertook Albatross banding and whale counts of primarily Southern Right Whales for the New Zealand Wildlife Service.

In April 1992, staff of the weather station were snorkelling at Northwest Bay when one of them, Mike Fraser, was attacked by a great white shark some offshore from the beach at Middle Bay. Fraser managed to return to shore with the assistance of one of his team, Jacinda Amey, after suffering severe lacerations to both his arms. The team kept Fraser alive at the bay—some from the main base—while a rescue helicopter from Taupō was called and made an emergency flight to the island to repatriate him to Invercargill Hospital. This was the longest ever single-engine helicopter rescue in the world.
Jacinda Amey was awarded the New Zealand Cross—the highest bravery medal for civilians—for assisting the injured team member from the water. The rescue helicopter pilot, John Funnell, was awarded the New Zealand Bravery Medal.

In 1995, station staff were permanently withdrawn when the manual weather observation programme was replaced by an automated weather station, and the upper air soundings ceased. Today periodic visits to the island are undertaken by Meteorological Service staff to maintain the weather station on Royal New Zealand Navy vessels, which also transport conservation staff undertaking field research. Other visitors to the island include occasional summer time eco-tourism cruises.

In May 2018, scientists in New Zealand documented what they believe is the largest wave ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere to date. The wave was measured by a weather buoy near the island.

==The legend of &quot;The Lady of the Heather&quot;==
&quot;The Lady of the Heather&quot; is the title of a 1945 romantic novel by Will Lawson. The novel is a mixture of facts and fiction elaborating on the incidents surrounding Captain Hasselburg&#x27;s death on Campbell Island. The story is about a daughter of Bonnie Prince Charlie, exiled to Campbell Island after she is suspected of treachery to the Jacobite cause.
Her character was inspired by Elizabeth Farr. Farr was probably what would now be called a &quot;ship girl&quot;, but the presence of a European woman at this remote place, and her death, gave rise to &quot;The Lady of the Heather&quot; story.

The accident happened when William Tucker was present on the &quot;Aurora&quot;. Tucker was another unusual character in the sealing era who became the source of a legend and a novel. The remoteness and striking appearance of the sealing grounds, whether on mainland New Zealand or the subantarctic islands, and the sealing era&#x27;s early place in Australasia&#x27;s European history, supply the elements for romance and legend which are generally absent in the area&#x27;s colonial history.

==Climate==
Campbell Island has a maritime tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). The island receives only 647 hours of bright sunshine annually and it can expect less than an hour&#x27;s sunshine on 215 days (59%) of the year. The peaks of the island are frequently obscured by clouds. It has an annual rainfall of , with rain, mainly light showers or drizzle (although it often snows in the winter and spring), falling on an average of 325 days a year. It is a windy place, with gusts of over occurring on at least 100 days each year. Variations in daily and annual temperatures are small with a mean annual temperature of , rarely rising above . The warmest temperature ever recorded was and the coldest was .

==Flora and fauna==

===Important Bird Area===
Campbell Island is the most important breeding area of the southern royal albatross. The island is part of the Campbell Island group Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds as well as the endemic Campbell teal and Campbell snipe. Campbell Island also hosts numerous penguin species that breed on the island, including the yellow-eyed penguin, the rockhopper penguin, and the erect-crested penguin. Other albatross species breed on the island as well, such as the endemic Campbell black-browed albatross, a few pairs of Antipodean albatross, the light-mantled sooty albatross, Black-browed mollymawk and the grey-headed mollymawk. Other bird species that breed on the island include the sooty shearwater, the grey petrel, the white-chinned petrel, the endemic Campbell Island shag, the grey duck, the southern skua, the southern black-backed gull, the red-billed gull, the Antarctic tern, the song thrush, the Common blackbird, the Dunnock (Hedge sparrow), the New Zealand pipit, the white-eye, the lesser redpoll, the chaffinch, and the starling.

===World&#x27;s most remote tree===
Campbell Island is home to what is believed to be the world&#x27;s most remote tree – a solitary Sitka spruce, more than 100 years old. The nearest tree is over away on the Auckland Islands. The tree is believed to have been introduced by Lord Ranfurly between 1901 and 1907. Australian academics have proposed designating the tree as a golden-spike signal-marker for the start of the anthropocene epoch.

===Conservation===
In 1954, the island was gazetted as a nature reserve. Feral Campbell Island cattle were eliminated by about 1984, and feral Campbell Island sheep were culled during the 1970s and 1980s, with their eventual extermination in 1992. In 2001, brown rats (Norway rats) were eradicated from the island nearly 200 years after their introduction. This was the world&#x27;s largest rat eradication programme. The island&#x27;s rat-free status was confirmed in 2003. Since the eradication, vegetation and invertebrates have been recovering, seabirds have been returning and the Campbell teal, the world&#x27;s rarest duck, has been reintroduced. An undescribed &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot; parakeet was discovered (in fossil bones) in 2004, along with evidence of a falcon or harrier. Banded dotterel (&quot;Charadrius bicinctus&quot;) are also believed to have inhabited the island at one point. Other native landbirds include the New Zealand pipit and the Campbell snipe, a race of the Subantarctic snipe, &quot;Coenocorypha aucklandica&quot;, described race perseverance. It was discovered only in 1997 on a tiny rat-free island off the south coast, Jacqeumart Island. The snipe had survived there and began recolonising the main island after the rats had been removed.

Marine mammals have shown gradual recovery in the past decades. Sea lions and southern elephant seals have begun to re-colonize the island. Some southern right whales still come into bays in the winter to winter or calve, most notably at Northwest Bay and Perseverance Harbour, but in much smaller number than in the Auckland Islands. Historically, fin whales used to inhabit close to shore.

The area is one of five subantarctic island groups designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

== Geology ==
Campbell Island is an extinct alkaline shield volcano that marine erosion has worn down into its present shape. The volcano has been extinct for some six million years, and glacial ice cover prevented vegetation from growing on the island until approximately 15,000 years ago. Basalt, hawaiite, mugearite and trachyte are the dominant volcanic rocks comprising Campbell Island. They were erupted between 6.5 and 11 million years ago during the Miocene epoch. The island is considered to be part of the submerged continent of Zealandia.

==Research==
During World War II, the Cape Expedition coast watching programme included trained naturalists who made observations of the geology, flora, and fauna of Campbell Island.

To mark the 200th anniversary of its discovery, the Campbell Island Bicentennial Expedition (CIBE) was undertaken from December 2010 to February 2011. The research expedition was the largest multidisciplinary expedition to the island in over 20 years, and aimed to document the island&#x27;s human history, assess recovery of the island&#x27;s flora and invertebrate fauna since the removal of sheep and the world&#x27;s largest rat eradication programme, study the island&#x27;s plentiful but little understood streams and characterise the unusual stream fauna, and reconstruct past environmental conditions and deduce long term climate change from tarn sediment cores.

The expedition was run by the 50 Degrees South Trust, a charitable organisation established to further research and education on New Zealand&#x27;s Subantarctic Islands, and to support the preservation and management of these World Heritage ecosystems. The expedition and the programme outputs can be followed at the CIBE website.

<doc id="1137268" wikidata="Q7637305" url="?curid=1137268" title="Summer Desire">
<text>Summer Desire is the name of the first and only night-time special aired under the &quot;Another World&quot; soap opera banner. Touted as special event programming, the hour-long episode aired just before the Daytime Emmy Awards on June 23, 1992.

Unlike other soaps, which also aired one-off specials at night, the &quot;Another World&quot; special followed existing storylines, in the hopes that viewers tuning in early for the Daytime Emmys would be intrigued with what they saw and, by extension, would watch the show in the afternoon.

The universal theme was love, and the stories followed four existing (and popular) couples in the series. To appeal to many demographics, thirtyish couple Cass (Stephen Schnetzer) and Frankie (Alice Barrett) were featured, as well as twentysomethings Ryan and Vicky (Paul Michael Valley and Jensen Buchanan) and Jake and Paulina (Tom Eplin and Judi Evans Luciano). Teen supercouple Dean and Jenna (Ricky Paull Goldin and Alla Korot) received most of the story in the special episode, as a party was being thrown in honor of his new album. On the show, Dean was a budding singer, and an album was produced. One of his songs, &quot;Ladykiller&quot;, became wildly popular and was played on the Times Square Jumbotron in the special episode.

Other stories revolved around Jake and Paulina seeking out a justice of the peace to get married, only to end up calling it off, while Ryan and Vicky fought their attraction to one another, only to give in to their desires at the end of the episode.

The special brought in low ratings, ranking 78th out of 96 programs that week with a 6.1/11 rating/share, ranking a distant third in its timeslot, behind &quot;Full House&quot; (#11, 12.7/24) and &quot;Home Improvement&quot; (#3, 14.8/27) on ABC, and &quot;Rescue 911&quot; (#14, 12.3/23) on CBS. Another &quot;AW&quot; nighttime special was not attempted, although its sister show, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, produced more one-off episodes.

<text>Staff is a kind of artificial stone used for covering and ornamenting temporary buildings. 
It is chiefly made of plaster of Paris (powdered gypsum), with a little cement, glycerin, and dextrin, mixed with water until it is about as thick as molasses. When staff is cast in molds, it can form any shape. To strengthen it, coarse cloth or bagging, or fibers of hemp or jute, are put into the molds before casting. It becomes hard enough in about a half-hour to be removed and fastened on the building in construction. Staff may easily be bent, sawed, bored, or nailed. Its natural color is murky white, but it may be made to resemble any kind of stone.

Staff was invented in France in about 1876 and was used in the construction and ornamentation of the buildings of the Paris Expositions of 1878 and of 1889. It was also largely used in the construction of the buildings of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, at the Omaha and Buffalo Expositions in 1898 and 1901, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, and at later expositions, and on temporary buildings of other kinds.

<doc id="1137274" wikidata="Q4540356" url="?curid=1137274" title="$40 a Day">
<text>$40 a Day was a Food Network show hosted by Rachael Ray. In each episode, Ray takes a one-day trip to an American, Canadian, or European city with only $40 US, to spend on food. While touring the city, she finds restaurants to go to (often based on local recommendations), and usually manages to fit three meals and some sort of snack or after-dinner drink into her small budget.

The show premiered on April 1, 2002, five months after the debut of &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot;, making it her second show on the Food Network. Some clips are sometimes used in Ray&#x27;s later series, &quot;Rachael Ray&#x27;s Tasty Travels&quot;. Another Food Network series, &quot;Giada&#x27;s Weekend Getaways&quot; starring Giada De Laurentiis, is similar in format, as noted by Anthony Bourdain. In 2010, The Travel Channel began airing reruns of the show. As of 2013, the show is no longer in reruns on the Travel Channel.

==Details==
According to Ray, visiting a fast food restaurant, particularly those of national chains, is considered cheating (she says so explicitly in the Orlando episode). On occasion, smaller sit-down restaurant chains (such as Bahama Breeze in the Las Vegas episode, or Bongos in the South Beach episode) are visited. Generally, non-food items and non-food-related activities are not included in her budget.

Ray always offers tips on what to see in the various cities, as well as hints on how to save money and find bargains while traveling. She also emphasizes researching whatever city she plans to visit through the Internet and asking the local citizens for their recommendations.

Initially, Ray only used item prices against her $40 limit. She started including applicable taxes and tips during the first season. On occasion, she does go over budget; however, during her trips to Philadelphia and Arizona, she did so on purpose. Her cheapest day was in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2003, when she spent just under $25 USD including taxes and tips (at the time, less than $40 Canadian, although she budgeted for $40 USD). On occasions, she has had to get creative to stay on-budget; for example, she accidentally blew half her budget on her second meal in her first Miami episode.

The pilot, shot in Los Angeles, had a 12-hour limit, but subsequent episodes raised it to 24 hours. Usually episodes begin in the morning with breakfast, occasionally brunch. Episodes almost always feature four paid meals, but on at least one occasion, in the Research Triangle (Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC), she did five meals. Also on rare occasion, only three meals are paid, and a fourth ends up being free. On only one occasion, in Antigua, she partook of a hotel&#x27;s free Continental breakfast, but she still did four paid meals in that episode.

On her first visit to Las Vegas during the first season, Ray began with dinner and stayed overnight, ending with breakfast.

She did several episodes in Europe when the euro was still valued less than the U.S. dollar. She has not visited Europe since the U.S. dollar has fallen under the euro in value. She has also visited several island locales, including Bermuda and Antigua, both of which generally accept the U.S. dollar.

Ray has occasionally drawn controversy when some meals end up calculating with less-than-traditional tips.

<text>The Leverett Glacier () is about long and wide, flowing from the Antarctic Plateau to the south end of the Ross Ice Shelf through the Queen Maud Mountains.
It is an important part of the South Pole Traverse from McMurdo Station to the Admundson–Scott South Pole Station, providing a route for tractors to climb from the ice shelf through the Transantarctic Mountains to the polar plateau.

==Discovery and naming==

The Leverett Glacier was discovered in December 1929 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Laurence Gould, and named by him for Frank Leverett, an eminent geologist at the University of Michigan and an authority on the glacial geology of the central United States.

==Course==

The Leverett Glacier forms on the polar plateau to the west of the California Plateau.
The Stanford Plateau is to the east.
It flows north through the Watson Escarpment between Mount Beazley to the west and McLean Peak to the east, then turns to flow in a north-north-west direction between the Tapley Mountains and Harold Byrd Mountains.
It passes Price Peak, Mount Webster, George Nunatak, Marsh Ridge and Kelley Nunatak.
It turns northwest and flows to the southwest to the Ross Ice Shelf, which it enters between Reynolds Nunatak to the west and Mount Fridovich to the east.
The Leverett Glacier terminates to the east of the Scott Glacier. 
There are no named tributaries.

According to &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1960), &quot;The Leverett Glacier fronting the Watson Escarpment is imperfectly defined on its eastern and northern margins. This glacier of comparatively low gradient brings a large volume of ice from the eastern plateau to the Ross shelf ice. The outlet glaciers, from the Liv to the Robert Scott, produce a common piedmont in front of the flanking foothills; this piedmont is deflected northwestward by the ice flow descending from the Leverett Glacier and the ice sheet northward of it. This stream, descending from the eastward plateau, produces extensive folding and other disturbances of the shelf ice between the Liv and Robert Scott Glaciers, and this broken area likely extends some distance northwestward.&quot;

==South Pole Traverse==

The Leverett Glacier is on the route through the Transantarctic Mountains for the South Pole Traverse (SPoT), an overland supply route between McMurdo Station and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station.
Until 2005 all fuel and other supplies were carried from the McMurdo Station to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station by Lockheed LC-130 Hercules aircraft equipped with skis, at considerable cost.
Starting in 2005 the South Pole Traverse was opened to deliver fuel using modified agricultural tractors pulling sleds holding bladders of fuel.
The trip takes about 40 days each way.
The route leads southeast over the McMurdo Ice Shelf and the Ross Ice Shelf for about .
It then climbs up the Leverett Glacier to the Antarctic Plateau, rising along the glacier.
The remainder of the route is a direct line of across the Antarctic Plateau.

The glaciological and meteorological conditions in the Leverett Glacier area are highly variable.
The inbound South Pole Traverse (SPoT) in December 2013 found an open crevasse about long and wide near the transverse route.
Crevasses of this nature are potentially dangerous, and are hard to predict.

==Features==
The glacier passes various isolated features:

===Price Peak===
A peak, high, located at the north side of Leverett Glacier, north of the extremity of California Plateau.

<text>Trefeca (also Trefecca, Trevecca, and Trevecka), located between Talgarth and Llangorse Lake in what is now south Powys in Wales, was the birthplace and home of the 18th-century Methodist leader Howell Harris (1714–1773), (). It was also the site of two Calvinistic Methodist colleges at different times; the first sponsored by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, (an English Methodist leader) in the late-18th century; the second supported by the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Church in the later 19th century.

==Teulu Trefeca==
In 1752, Harris, who was born in Trefeca and was one of the foremost leaders of the Welsh Methodist revival, established a Christian community there known as &quot;Teulu Trefeca&quot; (&#x27;the Trefeca Family&#x27;), modelled on the Moravian Herrnhutt community of Count von Zinzendorf.

John Wesley preached for Harris&#x27;s &#x27;family&#x27; when visiting Trevecca in August 1769 for the first anniversary of Trevecca College.

The additions to Harris&#x27;s family house were in an unusual neo-Gothic architectural style, one of the first examples in Wales, completed by 1772.

==Trevecca College (1768–1792)==
In 1768, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, established a theological seminary in Trevecca. The remote site was chosen partly in order that Harris, the Countess&#x27;s friend, could keep watch on the new institution for her. The opening of the college coincided with the expulsion from St Edmund Hall, Oxford of six students because of their alleged Methodist leanings. Most of the six were sponsored by Lady Huntingdon to form part of the inaugural student body at her college.

The use of the term &#x27;college&#x27; set Trevecca apart from the Dissenting Academies, but was controversial in the mid-eighteenth century, implying some measure of equivalence with the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Many students at Trevecca, however, were not of sufficient means to attend the ancient universities and, unlike an exclusively scholarly setting, and despite their isolated situation, studies at Trevecca were frequently interrupted by long preaching assignments around Britain.

The college transferred to Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, in 1792. The building used is now a farmhouse (College Farm).

Cheshunt College was later affiliated with the Congregational Union of England and Wales. It moved again in 1906 to Cambridge and merged with Westminster College, Cambridge in 1967.

===Notable students===
* Samuel Eyles Pierce, English preacher, theologian, and Calvinist divine
* John Eyre (evangelical minister), co-founder of the London Missionary Society

==Trevecca College (1842–1906)==
Thomas Charles, a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist had tried to arrange for taking over the Trevecca College buildings when the trustees of the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion removed their seminary to Cheshunt in 1792; but the Bala revival broke out just at the time, and, when things grew quieter, other matters pressed for attention. A college had been mooted in 1816, but the intended tutor died suddenly, and the matter was for the time dropped.

Candidates for the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Connexional ministry were compelled to shift for themselves until 1837, when Lewis Edwards (1809–1887) and David Charles (1812–1878) opened a school for young men at Bala. North and South alike adopted it as their college, the associations contributing a hundred guineas each towards the education of their students. In 1842, the South Wales Association opened a college at Trevecca in the old home of Howell Harris. The Rev. David Charles became principal of Trevecca (from 1842 to 1863), and the Rev. Lewis Edwards of Bala. After the death of Dr Lewis Edwards, Dr. Thomas Charles Edwards resigned the principalship of the University College at Aberystwyth to become head of Bala (1891), now a purely theological college, the students of which were sent to the university colleges for their classical training.

In 1872, a Harris Memorial Chapel was added to Trefeca, designed by R. G. Thomas of Menai Bridge. The building is now Coleg Trefeca, a lay training centre for the Presbyterian Church of Wales.

In 1905 David Davies of Llandinam, one of the leading laymen in the Connexion, offered a large building at Aberystwyth as a gift to the denomination for the purpose of uniting North and South in one theological college; but in the event of either association declining the proposal, the other was permitted to take possession, giving the association that should decline the option of joining at a later time. The Association of the South accepted, and that of the North declined, the offer; Trevecca College was turned into a preparatory school on the lines of a similar institution set up at Bala in 1891. In 1906 this became the United Theological College in Aberystwyth under its Principal Owen Prys.

===Howell Harris Museum===
The Howell Harris Museum is located at Coleg Trefeca. Open by appointment, the exhibits focus on the life of Howell Harris and the community of Teulu Trefeca that he founded.

<doc id="1137283" wikidata="Q1053661" url="?curid=1137283" title="Westland Tai Poutini National Park">
<text>Westland Tai Poutini National Park is a national park located on the western coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Established in 1960 as Westland National Park to commemorate the centenary of the European settlement of Westland District, it covers of largely mountainous terrain and forest. The park borders the Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park along the Main Divide of the Southern Alps, and includes many of the West Coast&#x27;s glaciers, most notably including the Fox / Te Moeka o Tuawe and Franz Josef / Kā Roimata o Hine Hukatere glaciers.

The small tourist towns of Fox Glacier and Franz Josef / Waiau are the main settlements within the park, while remnants of old gold mining towns can be found along the coast. The park offers hunting opportunities for red deer, chamois, and tahr, while helicopters allow hunters to access the rugged, mountainous areas. The popular Copland Track runs upstream from the Karangarua River bridge. Along with the mountain scenery visible from the track, there are hot springs at Welcome Flat Hut.

==History==
Ngāi Tahu historically travelled in Westland coastal areas gathering pounamu. Settlements were located along the coast, with larger villages at Maitahi and Makāwhio, and a pā at Ōkārito. The Ngāi Tahu were known to traverse the inland features now in the park, having high familiarity with the landmarks of the area. Many local Māori mountaineers are remembered, and served as guides for European explorers.

Colonial European expansion and settlement in the area was in part driven by desire for coal and gold, leading to the West Coast gold rush in the mid-1860&#x27;s. The presence of alluvial gold led to mining of beaches and waterways now located within the modern-day park. As a result of the gold rush, settlements at Gillespies Beach, Ōkārito, Three Mile beach and Five Mile beach were created or expanded. The conquest for gold subsided within a decade, though further surveying and familiarity of the area among Europeans led to more visitors seeking out its scenic vistas. Within a short period of time, with access to the area improving, tourism and hospitality-related businesses grew rapidly.

While numerous registered archaeological and historic sites are located in the park, few relate to pre-European history. This under-representation is acknowledged in relation to management of the park, while noting that existing Māori wāhi tapu (sacred sites) are not disclosed.

===Park expansion===
The park has been progressively expanded since its establishment, largely through incorporating nearby forest reserves or other conservation land. Ōkārito and Waikukupa State Forests were added to the park in 1982, followed by the upper Karangarua Valley in 1983, North Ōkārito and Saltwater State Forests in 2002, and over of other land scattered throughout the park in 2010.

==Geography==

Westland Tai Poutini National Park covers exclusively on the western side of the South Island&#x27;s main divide, making it New Zealand&#x27;s fifth largest national park. The park covers a wide variety of environments, ranging from high alpine tundra near the park&#x27;s border with Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park to coastal wetlands around Ōkārito Lagoon. This contributes to a large variation in elevation within the park, which extends from sea level to at Mount Tasman. The mountains are also responsible for the high degree of orographic rainfall which occurs in the park due to the prevailing westerlies, contributing in turn to the dense temperate rainforest found throughout the park.

== Ecology ==

=== Fauna ===
The coastal wetlands provide excellent habitat for wading bird species. Lake Māpōurika is home to the threatened Kāmana / Pūteketeke, while Ōkārito Lagoon is known for the presence of kōtuku. Kea are typically found throughout the park.

The only population of Okarito kiwi (rowi) reside in the lowland forests of the park.

<text>Massey Hall is a performing arts theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1894, it is known for its outstanding acoustics and was the long-time hall of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. An intimate theatre, it was originally designed to seat 3,500 patrons, but after extensive renovations in the 1940s, it now seats only up to 2,765. It has an extensive history of concerts by artists of many musical genres which continues today.

Massey Hall was a gift to the people of Toronto from industrialist Hart Massey. Massey Hall was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on June 15, 1981. The hall closed in July 2018 for a two-year-long renovation including a new seven-storey addition and two smaller concert rooms. It re-opened in 2021.

It is operated by The Corporation of Massey Hall and Roy Thomson Hall, a non-profit charitable organization. It is located at the intersection of Shuter and Victoria Streets, just east of Yonge Street, in downtown Toronto.

==History==

The idea of Massey Music Hall (its original name) began with Hart Massey, who wanted to build a music hall in order to fill the need for a secular meeting place where people from Toronto and area could meet and enjoy choral music not of a religious theme. Massey also wanted to construct the building in memory of his son Charles, who loved music. Massey also did not want the music hall to make large profits. He wanted both rich and poor to attend events. Ideally, once all expenses were paid, Massey wanted tickets for a season of lectures to sell for $1.

The building was designed with a neoclassical facade and features Moorish arches that span the width of the interior hall. This interior was inspired by the Alhambra Palace in Spain as well as Louis Sullivan&#x27;s Chicago Auditorium. The exterior is Palladian architecture while the interior is Moorish Revival architecture. The exterior neoclassical facade was a preference voiced from Lillian, Hart Massey&#x27;s daughter. Around the top of the hall are thirty stained glass windows, each depicting a famous composer made by the Faircloth Brothers glass firm. The foyer is finished in Art Deco style.

Designed by architect Sidney Badgley, Massey Hall was completed in 1894 at a cost of . Construction was financed by Massey, the founder of the Massey Manufacturing (later Massey Ferguson) manufacturing conglomerate. The hall&#x27;s debut concert was a choral performance of Handel&#x27;s &#x27;Messiah&#x27; on June 14, 1894.

Ten years after the completion of construction (after the 1904 Toronto Great Fire), a pair of fire escape staircases were installed along the front face of the building. They were installed to deal with fire concerns of the building. These fire escapes (now removed) were considered an iconic part of Massey Hall&#x27;s exterior. At some point in its renovation history, three of the windows at the front of the venue were converted into doors. The doors at the front of the venue were painted red (from their earlier brown-gold colour), a giant neon sign was hung above the main entrance, and notice boards listing upcoming acts were revamped on either side of those doors.
The Albert Building, at 15 Shuter Street, was added as a janitorial residence in 1917 and later converted as backstage space. It has since been demolished and replaced by a new addition during the 2010s renovations. It had a unique two-storey oriel window. In 1933, the Massey Foundation undertook further renovations to the hall. The venue simplified its name to Massey Hall at this time. Further renovations occurred in the 1940s.

Sister venue Roy Thomson Hall was known as New Massey Hall during the early planning stages. It was intended to replace Massey Hall as the primary venue for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, although the intention was always for Massey Hall to remain open for other purposes following renovations. Its permanent name as Roy Thomson Hall was announced in January 1982, following a donation from media mogul and philanthropist Roy Thomson.

In 1994, to commemorate the hall&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the basement was completely refurbished to include Centuries, a fully stocked bar. Prior to this addition, alcohol was not permitted in the hall. The decor of Centuries includes hundreds of photos of artists who have performed there over the years (largely collecting portraits of popular music stars since the eighties), including many autographs. Centuries has a capacity of 220 people and often hosts CD releases and post-show parties for visiting artists. Roughly five years after Centuries was created, an additional bar in the balcony lounge was added.

In 2013, Massey Hall began a long-awaited major renovation, which included the demolition of the Albert Building and preparing the rear space for construction activities. In July 2018, Massey Hall announced phase two of the renovation, entitled &quot;Massey Hall Forever,&quot; which included extensive exterior and interior renovations, expanded stage, a new seven-story addition, two new smaller concert rooms and a new retractable seating system. The new addition is called the Allied Music Centre, located on the site of the Albert Building. It incorporates an artists&#x27; lab, studio, lounge and theatre. It was completed in 2022.

===Historic designations===
In 1973, Toronto City Council designated Massey Hall a Heritage Property under the province&#x27;s &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;. Massey Hall was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on June 15, 1981.

==Notable performers and events==
The primary use of the hall has been for musical performances, but the hall has been used for many types of events, including public memorials, speaking tours, and boxing, among others. Many dignitaries have attended the hall since its inauguration. In 1901, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (the future King George V and his wife Queen Mary) visited with Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier. Many prominent choirs, comedians, musicians, musical groups, singers and speakers have appeared on the stage of Massey Hall. The hall was also a prominent location for political speeches before the development of television.

Until 1984, the primary performer at the hall was the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, along with the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. Operatic singers have included Montserrat Caballe, Maria Callas, Enrico Caruso, Luciano Pavarotti and Vladimir Rosing. Classical musicians have included George Gershwin, Glenn Gould, Vladimir Horowitz, Oscar Peterson and Arturo Toscanini.

Lightfoot played the hall over 170 times in his career, the most of any artist, including both the last show in 2018 before it was closed for renovations and the first show after it reopened in 2021.

Speakers at the hall have included William Booth, Winston Churchill, Helen Keller, Thomas Mann and the Dalai Lama. Comics have included Jerry Seinfeld and Russell Peters.

===Notable appearances, concerts and related media===
In May 1953, Massey Hall was the location of a notable jazz concert put on by five of the genre&#x27;s most prominent artists of the era: Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Charles Mingus, and Max Roach. The performance was recorded and released as &quot;Jazz at Massey Hall&quot;.

Neil Young&#x27;s performance on January 19, 1971, was recorded and later released as a live album, entitled &quot;Live at Massey Hall 1971&quot;. Young has since performed several times at Massey Hall.

In June 1976, Rush recorded the live album &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; here. Max Webster, a Toronto band, opened for Rush and would later headline at the venue in 1977 and 1978, followed by a solo performance by Kim Mitchell, formerly of Max Webster, in 1984.

On January 8, 1995, Ronnie Hawkins celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert at Massey, which was documented on the album &quot;Let It Rock&quot;. The concert featured performances by Hawkins, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Band and Larry Gowan. Jeff Healey sat in on guitar for most, if not all, of the performances. Hawkins&#x27; band, The Hawks, or permutations of it, backed most, if not all, of the acts. All of the musicians performing that night were collectively dubbed &quot;The Rock ‘N’ Roll Orchestra.&quot;

The May 2008 performance by Matthew Good at Massey was released as a live album, entitled &quot;Live at Massey Hall&quot;.

In 2013, folk-rock band Whitehorse made their first appearance at the venue. In conjunction with the concert, the band released the 2013 EP &quot;The Road to Massey Hall&quot;, comprising covers of songs by other musicians who had played the hall in the past.

In 2015, Canadian rock band Spirit of the West performed at Massey. The preparations for it are profiled in the 2016 documentary film &quot;Spirit Unforgettable&quot;.

Toronto-born comedian, Russell Peters&#x27; April 2016 appearances at Massey Hall, were recorded for his Netflix stand-up special &quot;Almost Famous&quot;.

For the Juno Awards of 2021, which was performed from a variety of venues across Canada, the surviving members of the Tragically Hip performed their 2002 single &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life If You Don&#x27;t Weaken&quot; with Feist on lead vocals, which marked the band&#x27;s first televised performance since Gord Downie&#x27;s death.

On February 29, 2024, singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith staged a retrospective concert at the hall to mark his sixtieth birthday.

== Revitalization ==
In 2013, the Corporation of Roy Thomson and Massey Hall announced the closing of the performance space at Massey Hall for a revitalization project. The then 119-year-old building would proceed to undergo a two-phase renovation to restore some of the building&#x27;s historic elements and the construction of new spaces to improve the community-driven centre.

=== Phase One ===
Phase one of the Massey Hall Restoration began in 2013 and was completed in 2017. This project consisted of the deconstruction of the adjacent Albert Building to prepare for the foundation of the new tower that was planned to be constructed in Phase Two.
=== Phase two ===
The second and primary phase of the renovation was a project with a budget of up to million, including contributions of million from the Ontario and Canadian governments. The main aspects of the second phase included a full restoration of the interior and exterior elements and the construction of the new addition. The phase was completed in 2022. However, Massey Hall reopened for performances in November 2021.

==== Phase Two Full restoration ====

The renovation of the interior of Massey Hall incorporated upgrading the technology by implementing mechanized removable seating to provide space for a standing general-admission area during performances and enhancing the audio and lighting systems. This refurbishment allowed for more flexibility for a variety of performances. The audio enhancements included diminishing the echo effect of sound that occurs during performances by introducing sound-absorbing plaster into the space.
The refurbishment also restored the mixed architectural styles of Moorish revival, Palladian revival, and Art Deco found within the interior of the building while also ensuring the structural integrity of the building. The main idea was to make sure the Hall looked as if nothing had changed. This refurbishment procedure included the original wood, steel beams and restorers, repairing details, and making new plaster moulds of arch features if they were beyond repair. The ceiling had previously been covered in chicken wire to protect the audience below from debris. The renovation allowed audiences to see the repaired detailed ceiling. The interior renewal also consisted of keeping the Hall’s original brass railings and new seats, which mimicked the originals.

The renovation moreover, focused on re-establishing the 100 original stained-glass windows that had been concealed with plywood since the 1950s due to sound disturbances. The refurbishment of the panes involved the fitting of noise defensive shades for the glass during concerts and performances. The renovation also facilitated the updating of Massey Hall to meet current Canadian accessibility standards. These updates included a Passerelle to connect the old Massey Hall to the addition and an elevator allowing individuals easy access to the upper levels. The grand stage was rebuilt and lifted to provide better visibility from the upper gallery seats. The restoration additionally re-established new backstage artist and performer accommodations.
==== Allied Music Centre ====
The construction of the new southern seven-story glass addition, named the Allied Music Centre, was designed to accommodate more support spaces for the hall. Accessible through the outdoor passerelles, the addition contains rehearsal spaces, a performance studio, a lounge, new washrooms, dressing rooms for performers, and a loading dock for equipment and deliveries. On the fourth floor, is the new 500 seat TD Music Centre. It additionally contains the Deane Cameron Recording Studio, which gets its name from the late Massey Hall CEO. Located in the basement is a bar that has another performance space as well. The new modern glass passerelles leading to the tower hangs off the side of Massey Hall and contrasts with the original brick structure creating a connection between the new and the old. This state-of-the-art facility was designed and designated as a space for the community, artistic development and outreach initiatives.

=== Architects ===
The two-phase restoration process of Massey Hall was led by Marianne McKenna of KPMB Architects and Christopher Borgal of GBCA Architects. KPMB mainly focused on the architecture and interior design aspects, while GBCA focused on the heritage impact and restoration perspective. The total budget was million.

==Public transportation==
An entrance to Queen subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University is located nearby at the corner of Shuter Street and Yonge Street.

The 501 Queen streetcar line stops at the corner of Victoria Street and Queen Street.

<text>Roy Thomson Hall is a concert hall in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Located downtown in the city&#x27;s entertainment district, it is home to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, and the esports team Toronto Defiant. Opened in 1982, its circular architectural design exhibits a sloping and curvilinear glass exterior. It was designed by Canadian architects Arthur Erickson and Mathers and Haldenby. Itzhak Perlman acted as a special advisor to the architects on accessibility needs for disabled performers and guests.

The hall seats 2,630 guests and features a pipe organ built by Canadian organ builder Gabriel Kney from London, Ontario.

The hall was formerly known as The New Massey Hall during its construction and pre-construction phase. It acquired its official name on January 14, 1982, as thanks to the family of Roy Thomson (first Lord Thomson of Fleet and founder of the publishing empire Thomson Corporation), who had donated C$4.5 million to complete the fundraising efforts for the new hall.

The hall was renovated over a period of six months in 2002, after years of complaints from musicians about the quality of its acoustics.

Filmmaker Jeffery Klassen&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Toronto Architecture&quot; interviews Arthur Erickson about the structure. Erickson speaks of the point of the grey structure being that of a container which people were to fill up with their own decorations. The pond was originally designed to be used as a skating rink in the winter. The building was influenced by Erickson&#x27;s journeys in Japan and his relationship with the North American Aboriginals.

The hall is one of the main venues used by the Toronto International Film Festival, with many gala screenings held there each year including a festival-closing screening of the year&#x27;s People&#x27;s Choice Award winner. The concert hall was used in scenes of the 2000 film &quot;X-Men&quot;. The science fiction television series &quot;The Expanse&quot; uses it as the setting for the United Nations headquarters. The Amazon series &quot;The Boys&quot; also uses the hall as the bottom base for the otherwise digitally created superheroes&#x27; tower Vought Headquarters.

The hall was the venue of the state funeral of federal Leader of the Official Opposition and NDP leader Jack Layton on August 27, 2011.

<doc id="1137289" wikidata="Q7804455" url="?curid=1137289" title="Tim Watson">
<text>Timothy Michael Watson (born 13 July 1961) is a former AFL player for Essendon and current broadcaster for more than 30 years, with the Seven Network since 1992 &amp; 1116 SEN radio.

After retiring from the game, he also continued working in the Australian football industry as a coach.

Watson was the fourth-youngest player ever to play in the VFL/AFL competition and made a comeback after retirement which included another premiership.

Watson has been a prominent and popular sports journalist and media personality.

==Playing career==
===Essendon===
Watson made his VFL debut in 1977 for Essendon at the age of fifteen years and 305 days, the fourth-youngest player in the history of the League.

Watson won the Essendon best-and-fairest award four times (1980, 1985, 1988 and 1989). In 1989, he won the AFL Players Association MVP award, now known as the Leigh Matthews Trophy.

Watson played the ruck-rover in Essendon&#x27;s 1984 and 1985 grand final victories. He was made captain in 1989 and held that position until 1991, before retiring from the game due to the injury problems that had plagued the later part of his career. In the 1992 pre-season draft, Watson was recruited by the West Coast Eagles even though he had signalled his intention to retire. He never played a game for the club, instead continuing a commentary role with the Seven Network for 1992, which included working as a boundary rider in that year&#x27;s grand final, which the Eagles won. 

====Comeback====
Early in the 1993 season, Essendon senior coach Kevin Sheedy lured Watson out of retirement. Although Watson was not as fit as he had once been, and was never able to recapture his top form, he played a vital role in the forward line, kicking some important goals throughout the year. His experience in what was a very young team was instrumental in helping Essendon win an unexpected premiership that year. 

After the 1994 season, Watson retired for good as a player, having played 307 games and kicked 335 goals for Essendon. He was also a member of Essendon&#x27;s 1984, 1985 and 1993 premiership teams. 

Since his retirement, Watson was named the sixth-greatest player to ever play for Essendon in the &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot; list, and he was named ruck-rover in their &quot;Team of the Century&quot;.

==Coaching career==

===St Kilda Football Club senior coach (1999–2000)===
Watson became senior coach of the St Kilda Football Club, when he replaced Stan Alves, after Alves was sacked at the end of the 1998 season. Watson was then the senior coach of the St Kilda Football Club in the 1999 season and the 2000 season. His success was limited, with the side winning only 12 of the 44 matches they played while he was in charge, including drawing once and losing 31, bringing the winning percentage to 27 percent. In the 1999 season, St Kilda finished tenth on the ladder with ten wins and twelve losses. In the 2000 season, St Kilda won only two games for the entire season, with one draw and 19 losses, where they finished 16th (last on the ladder) for the wooden spoon, and Watson resigned during the middle of the 2000 season, where he would step down at season&#x27;s end, forgoing the final year of his three-year contract. Watson was then replaced by Malcolm Blight as St Kilda Football Club senior coach.

==Media career==
Like many past players, Watson has become a media personality, serving as a sports presenter on &quot;Seven News&quot; in Melbourne as well as having a special comments role on Seven&#x27;s AFL coverage.

He has also appeared on many football-related TV shows: as a sports columnist in &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper, and from 2004 until 2013 as a co-host on the &quot;Morning Glory&quot; show with Andrew Maher on Melbourne radio station 1116 SEN.

In November 2013, Watson resigned from 1116 SEN to spend more time at the Seven Network; it was later announced that he would replace Sandy Roberts as weeknight sport presenter on &quot;Seven News&quot; in Melbourne. In 2015, Watson returned to the breakfast shift at 1116 SEN.

In November 2024, Watson announced his retirement from the Seven Network. Rebecca Maddern has been confirmed as his replacement. 

==Personal life==
During the late 1970s, Watson&#x27;s older brother Larry also played at Essendon as well as before moving to Adelaide to play with West Adelaide in 1981, going on to win the SANFL premiership with Wests in 1983.

In 1993, Watson was named &#x27;Victorian Father of the Year&#x27;. In the 2002 National Draft, his son, Jobe Watson, was drafted by Essendon under the father–son rule. Tim and Jobe were both coached by Kevin Sheedy.
Tim also has a younger brother Rick who currently lives in Tocumwal in New South Wales.

Tim is married to Susie Watson; their children include son Jobe and daughters Billie, Tess and Grace.

First observed in December 1929 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Laurence Gould. 
Visited in December 1934 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Quin Blackburn, and named by Byrd for James G. Stahlman, newspaper publisher of Nashville, Tennessee, a supporter of the expedition.

===Mount Wallace===
One of the Tapley Mountains, high, standing at the south side of the mouth of Roe Glacier at the juncture with Scott Glacier. 
Named by US-ACAN for J. Allen Wallace, Jr., meteorologist, South Pole Station winter party, 1960.

===Mount Bushnell===
Mountain, high, between Mount Durham and Pincer Point in the northwest part of Tapley Mountains.

<text>The Bezold effect is an optical illusion, named after a German professor of meteorology Wilhelm von Bezold (1837–1907), who discovered that a color may appear different depending on its relation to adjacent colors. 

It happens when small areas of color are interspersed. An assimilation effect called the von Bezold spreading effect, similar to spatial color mixing, is achieved. 

The opposite effect is observed when large areas of color are placed adjacent to each other, resulting in color contrast.

<doc id="1137305" wikidata="Q2614377" url="?curid=1137305" title="Four Seasons Centre">
<text>The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts is a 2,071-seat theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located at the southeast corner of University Avenue and Queen Street West, across from Osgoode Hall. The land on which it is located was a gift from the Government of Ontario. It is the home of the Canadian Opera Company (COC) and the National Ballet of Canada. The building&#x27;s modernist design by was created by Canadian firm Diamond Schmitt Architects, headed by Jack Diamond. It was completed in 2006, and the interior design includes an unusual glass staircase.

==History==
In the 1980s, the Canadian Opera Company and financier Hal Jackman, president of the Ballet Opera House Corporation, had begun lobbying for a new building to replace the O&#x27;Keefe Centre (now known as Meridian Hall). This building had housed the opera company for about 40 years. The company had also previously been housed in the Royal Alexandra Theatre on King Street and the Elgin Theatre on Yonge Street. Earlier in the city&#x27;s history, the Grand Opera House stood at Bay and Adelaide until it was demolished in 1927.

===Bay Street proposal===
In 1984, Ontario premier Bill Davis promised that a piece of provincially owned land at Bay Street and Wellesley Street would be the home for the new opera house. The lot was estimated to be worth some million.

A design competition was won by the postmodern project of Moshe Safdie. In 1988, the project was approved and the existing stores and government offices on the site were demolished.

After a new Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) provincial government under Bob Rae was elected in 1990, inheriting a large deficit because of a recession, the million project was deemed excessively costly. The province was also dealing with the unexpectedly high million cost of the SkyDome project. When the opera house corporation refused to modify the design to lower costs, the government withdrew its funding commitment two months after the election. In 1992, the province cancelled the project and the land was sold to developers. Two towers in the &quot;Opera Place I and II&quot; development have been built on Bay Street (1998), but as of June 2011, the rest of the property remained vacant until the Teahouse Condo was completed in 2020.

===University Avenue project===
In 1997, the province allocated a parking lot, which previously housed offices for the Supreme Court of Ontario at Queen and University, for the project. The lot was valued at million, and the federal and provincial governments also pledged funding for a new more modest project that would cost about million. The original plan called for a tower of offices and condominiums to be built by Olympia and York which would help fund the project. It would be further supplemented by a million donation by Christopher Ondaatje. However, both Olympia and York and Ondaatje developed concerns about the project and withdrew. More importantly, the municipal government of Toronto refused to provide any municipal funding. The project collapsed again in 2000.

In 2002, the opera company under Richard Bradshaw issued an invitation in 2002 for designs. The company had secured a million donation from the Four Seasons hotel chain in exchange for perpetual naming rights to the complex. Ten architectural firms submitted proposals and the modernist design by Canadian company Diamond Schmitt Architects, headed by Jack Diamond, was selected.

The complex took three years to construct at an estimated cost of million. To provide wheelchair accessibility, elevator access to the concourse level of Osgoode subway station was integrated into the construction of the centre. The centre had its grand opening on 14 June 2006, with regularly scheduled performances commencing on 12 September 2006 with the inaugural production in the new opera house being Richard Wagner&#x27;s epic tetralogy &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (&quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;). Governor General Michaëlle Jean and other prominent Canadians attended the event. Three complete Ring Cycles were performed in September 2006.

==R. Fraser Elliott Hall design==

The five-tiered, horseshoe-shaped auditorium was modelled after European opera houses. Collaborating with Diamond Schmitt, New York-based theatre planning and design specialists Fisher Dachs Associates arranged the room&#x27;s geometry and seating configuration to bring each of the 2,000 seats, including tiered balconies, as close to the stage as possible while maintaining an unobstructed view.

The acoustics were designed by Bob Essert of Sound Space Design and a team that included Aercoustics Engineering, Wilson Ihrig and Engineering Harmonics. The undulating back walls of the venue, which diffuse the sound throughout the auditorium by reflecting the sound waves back to the stage, account for about 90 percent of the audible sound for the audience. To prevent audience members from detecting specific sounds and vibrations including traffic noise, the rumble from the adjacent Line 1 Yonge–University subway line and 501 Queen streetcar line, and even the sirens of the emergency vehicles rushing to the nearby hospitals, the theatre sits on 489 rubber insulating pads.

Other design elements reflect historic performance halls, including the Roman Amphitheatre.

==Exterior==
The hall was constructed on a limited budget, using contrasting materials. The City Room glass walls, curtain walls held by steel fixtures, look out on University Ave and Queen Street. The east, south and north sides are clad in dark brick. Windows on the north side have a view of Osgoode Hall, but the exterior on that side is unadorned.

On the west is the sidewalk extension City Room, which is transparent and which illuminates the street. The solid, massive eastern facade broken only by horizontal windows, in contrast, blends into its office building and brick surroundings, towards York Street. John Bentley Mays states in his 2006 &quot;Canadian Architect&quot; article that East wall is &quot;unresponsive to the need of vitality on the street.&quot; The southern, Richmond Street facade, also plain brick punctuated by dressing room windows, is opposite the Hilton Hotel. Architect Diamond defends his rather plain design, stating, &quot;You do not make a city out of iconic pieces.&quot;

==Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre==
The Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre in the City Room links Rings 3 and 4. It provides seating for 100 patrons. During the season several concerts per week in a variety of genres are presented here.

==Operatic and other production history==
Outside of the standard opera repertory, some of the less-often performed, new works, or national premieres performed by the Canadian Opera Company include:

<doc id="1137313" wikidata="Q16955605" url="?curid=1137313" title="Neon (Australian band)">
<text>Neon were a three-piece Australian rock band from Melbourne. Founders were Josh Bitmead on guitar and vocals, Britt Spooner on bass guitar and Jamie Gurney on drums. Their four-track extended play, &quot;A Man&quot; (October 2004) reached the top 50 of the Australian singles chart. It received critical acclaim in the British music media. Their debut album, &quot;Neon&quot;, appeared in July 2005.

==History==

Two Neon members, Josh Bitmead and Jamie Gurney, were originally from Broken Hill, New South Wales. The pair had played in a band, Porcelein, which won a Triple J Unearthed contest in the mid-to-late 1990s. After finishing year 12 they moved to Melbourne in 1996, Bitmead recalled &quot;I had to start life in a new town, looking to play in bands whilst holding down a boring job.&quot; Neon were formed in 2001 in that city to work on songs written by Bitmead (guitar, vocals), which included Gurney on drums and Britt Spooner on bass guitar. Spooner moved from Mildura in 1999 and is the sister of Bitmead&#x27;s friend; Bitmead and Spooner became a domestic couple before forming the trio. In the early years of Neon, Gurney also worked as a University admissions officer. Their first performance was in July 2001. The band started recording demos and supported shows by Dallas Crane, Magic Dirt, Rocket Science and You Am I.

Neon signed a record deal with Ivy League Records in 2001. Rocket Science&#x27;s lead guitarist Roman Tucker had passed on their demos to Ivy League&#x27;s Pete Lusty in October. Early in 2002 the trio signed with talent management company Winterman &amp; Goldstein, owned by Lusty and Andy Cassell (also co-owners of Ivy League). A demo tape was also sent to Steve McDonald of United States group Redd Kross who offered to produce a record for them in Los Angeles. In November 2002 Neon performed in LA, New York and London. A year late they took up McDonald&#x27;s offer and recorded an album&#x27;s worth of tracks. Recordings included contributions from Pat Smear and Dale Crover (Melvins drummer). Former Blur guitarist Graham Coxon had also heard their demo tape and released their extended play, &quot;A Man&quot;, on his Transcopic Records in April 2004. They followed with another EP, &quot;Hit Me Again&quot; in August, which Johnny Loftus of AllMusic rated at three-out-of-five, describing how their &quot;spry, sugary harmonies lock into guitars that rev like muscle cars racing over California viaducts&quot; while &quot;drums are pretty loud throughout&quot; which prevent this work from becoming &quot;contemporary power pop&quot;.

Their four-track EP &quot;A Man&quot; was released in Australia on 29 October 2004, which included the title track and re-recordings of three demo tracks – it was produced by McDonald and issued by Ivy League/Warner Music Group. The EP received good reviews from the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and BBC Radio 1. &quot;Oz Music Project&quot;″s Andrew Tuttle praised the title track, &quot;power pop of a high calibre&quot; and the &quot;excellent&quot; track, &quot;Hit Me Again&quot;. The EP reached No. 48 on the ARIA singles chart. Neon also supported Jet, the Vines and the Living End on their Aussie Invasion tour of the US.

The band signed a record deal in November 2004 with V2 Records for international distribution. The trio&#x27;s four-track EP &quot;Dizziness&quot; was issued on 27 May 2005, which reached the ARIA singles chart top 100. Their debut self-titled album followed on 8 July 2005 through Ivy League/Warner. It peaked at No. 13 on the ARIA Hitseekers albums chart. Gareth Bowles of &quot;Hybrid Magazine&quot; was disappointed by &quot;Neon&quot;, &quot;[it] has some appealing tunes, but they tend to be subsumed by the trite lyrics and over-eagerness of the players&quot;.

Anthony Troiano replaced Gurney on drums in early 2009. This lineup spent three months in a studio recording two new songs, &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Never Again&quot;. Troiano later worked as a jeweler after being tutored by a relative. From 2013 to 2016 he was the drummer for Palace of the King.

<doc id="1137326" wikidata="Q1637220" url="?curid=1137326" title="Hobble skirt">
<text>A hobble skirt was a skirt with a narrow enough hem to significantly impede the wearer&#x27;s stride. It was called a &quot;hobble skirt&quot; because it seemed to hobble any woman as she walked. Hobble skirts were a short-lived fashion trend that peaked between 1908 and 1914.

==History==

The hobble skirt may have been inspired by the Japanese kimono and by one of the first women to fly in an airplane. At a 1908 Wright Brothers demonstration in Le Mans, France, Mrs. Edith Ogilby Berg asked for a ride and became the first American woman to fly as a passenger in an airplane, soaring for two minutes and seven seconds. She tied a rope securely around her skirt at her ankles to keep it from blowing in the wind during the flight. According to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, a French fashion designer was inspired by the way Mrs. Berg walked away from the aircraft with her skirt still tied and created the hobble skirt based on her ingenuity.

The French fashion designer in the Berg story might have been Paul Poiret who claimed credit for the hobble skirt, but it is not clear whether the skirt was his invention or not. Skirts had been rapidly narrowing since the mid-1900s. Slim skirts were economical because they used less fabric.

The hobble skirt became popular just as women were becoming more physically active.

Hobble skirts inspired hundreds of cartoons and comic postcards. One series of comic cards called it the &quot;speed-limit skirt.&quot; There were several reports of women competing in hobble-skirt races as a joke.

Boarding a streetcar in a hobble skirt was difficult. In 1912, the New York Street Railway ran hobble-skirt cars with no step up. Los Angeles introduced similar streetcars in 1913.

Hobble skirts were directly responsible for several deaths. In 1910, a hobble-skirt-wearing woman was killed by a loose horse at a racetrack outside Paris. A year later, eighteen-year-old Ida Goyette stumbled on an Erie Canal bridge while wearing a hobble skirt, fell over the railing, and drowned.

To prevent women from splitting their skirts, some women wore a fetter or tied their legs together at the knee. Some designers made alterations to the hobble skirt to allow for greater movement. Jeanne Paquin concealed pleats in her hobble skirts while other designers such as Lucile offered slit or wrap skirts.

The trend began to decline in popularity at the beginning of World War I, as the skirt&#x27;s limited mobility did not suit the wartime atmosphere.

==The post-hobble skirt era==
The next time skirts would be narrow enough to impede movement would be with the sheath skirts of the 1950s, first introduced at the end of the 1940s. Though shorter lengths (from just below the knee to the lower calf) and advances in fabric would enable a little more movement than in the hobble-skirt era, the 1950s sheath skirt&#x27;s new waist-to-hem tightness, said to reveal the shape of the leg, still created problems of mobility, with split seams a familiar occurrence. Nonetheless, they were widely promoted by designers and the fashion industry, their narrowness exaggerated even more by having models pose with one leg directly in front of the other. Some other skirt styles of the time also had very narrow hems, particularly the knee-length puffball/pouf skirts shown by Pierre Cardin, Yves Saint Laurent, and others from 1957 to 1960. A few of Saint Laurent&#x27;s 1959 skirts were so narrow at the hem that some fashion writers revived the word &quot;hobble&quot; to refer to them. Sheath skirts remained part of the fashion picture into the early 1960s and then went very much out of style with the rise of the flared miniskirts of the mid- to late sixties and the easy, comfortable clothes of the 1970s.

Toward the end of the seventies, beginning in fall of 1978, some designers began reviving the narrow skirt silhouettes of decades past. Initially, many of them allowed some movement via slits, though not always. Some were so inhibiting that the word hobble was once again used to describe them. When the tight silhouette of the 1950s sheath skirt was revived in the early 1980s, it was somewhat less restricting, as it was now usually produced in stretchier, often knit fabrics and could even be in mini lengths, though there is only so much movement possible in a knee-length or longer skirt that is tight all the way to the hem. These 1980s-style stretch sheath skirts in various lengths have been revived off and on ever since.

<doc id="1137328" wikidata="Q1199349" url="?curid=1137328" title="Money market fund">
<text>A money market fund (also called a money market mutual fund) is an open-end mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper. Money market funds are managed with the goal of maintaining a highly stable asset value through liquid investments, while paying income to investors in the form of dividends. Although they are not insured against loss, actual losses have been quite rare in practice.

Regulated in the United States under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and in Europe under Regulation 2017/1131, money market funds are important providers of liquidity to financial intermediaries.

==Explanation==
Money market funds seek to limit exposure to losses due to credit, market, and liquidity risks. Money market funds in the United States are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Rule 2a-7 of the act restricts the quality, maturity and diversity of investments by money market funds. Under this act, a money fund mainly buys the highest rated debt, which matures in under 13 months. The portfolio must maintain a weighted average maturity (WAM) of 60 days or less and not invest more than 5% in any one issuer, except for government securities and repurchase agreements.

Securities in which money markets may invest include commercial paper, repurchase agreements, short-term bonds and other money funds. Money market securities must be highly liquid and of the highest quality.

== History ==
In 1971, Bruce R. Bent and Henry B. R. Brown established the first money market fund. It was named the Reserve Fund and was offered to investors who were interested in preserving their cash and earning a small rate of return. Several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years. Money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general, which until that time, were not widely utilized.

Money market funds in the United States created a solution to the limitations of Regulation Q, which at the time prohibited demand deposit accounts from paying interest and capped the rate of interest on other types of bank accounts at 5.25%. Thus, money market funds were created as a substitute for bank accounts.

In the 1990s, bank interest rates in Japan were near zero for an extended period of time. To search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits, investors used money market funds for short-term deposits instead. However, several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in 2001 due to the bankruptcy of Enron, in which several Japanese funds had invested, and investors fled into government-insured bank accounts. Since then the total value of money markets have remained low.

Money market funds in Europe have always had much lower levels of investments capital than in the United States or Japan. Regulations in the EU have always encouraged investors to use banks rather than money market funds for short-term deposits.

==Breaking the buck==

Money market funds seek a stable net asset value (NAV) per share (which is generally $1.00 in the United States). They aim to never lose money. The $1.00 is maintained through the declaration of dividends to shareholders, typically daily, at an amount equal to the fund&#x27;s net income. If a fund&#x27;s NAV drops below $1.00, it is said that the fund &quot;broke the buck&quot;. For SEC registered money funds, maintaining the $1.00 flat NAV is usually accomplished under a provision under Rule 2a-7 of the 40 Act that allows a fund to value its investments at amortized cost rather than market value, provided that certain conditions are maintained. One such condition involves a side-test calculation of the NAV that uses the market value of the fund&#x27;s investments. The fund&#x27;s published, amortized value may not exceed this market value by more than 1/2 cent per share, a comparison that is generally made weekly. If the variance does exceed $0.005 per share, the fund could be considered to have broken the buck, and regulators may force it into liquidation.

Buck breaking has rarely happened. Up to the 2008 financial crisis, only three money funds had broken the buck in the 37-year history of money funds.

While money market funds are typically managed in a fairly safe manner, there would have been many more failures over this period if the companies offering the money market funds had not stepped in when necessary to support their fund (by way of infusing capital to reimburse security losses) and avoid having the funds break the buck. This was done because the expected cost to the business from allowing the fund value to drop—in lost customers and reputation—was greater than the amount needed to bail it out.

The first money market mutual fund to break the buck was First Multifund for Daily Income (FMDI) in 1978, liquidating and restating NAV at 94 cents per share. An argument has been made that FMDI was not technically a money market fund as, at the time of liquidation, the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years. However, prospective investors were informed that FMDI would invest &quot;solely in Short-Term (30-90 days) MONEY MARKET obligations&quot;. Furthermore, the rule restricting the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in, Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, was not promulgated until 1983. Prior to the adoption of this rule, a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a money market fund, which FMDI did. Seeking higher yield, FMDI had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities, and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio. In order to meet increasing redemptions, the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a 3% loss, triggering a restatement of its NAV and the first instance of a money market fund &quot;breaking the buck&quot;.

The Community Bankers US Government Fund broke the buck in 1994, paying investors 96 cents per share. This was only the second failure in the then 23-year history of money funds and there were no further failures for 14 years. The fund had invested a large percentage of its assets into adjustable rate securities. As interest rates increased, these floating rate securities lost value. This fund was an institutional money fund, not a retail money fund, thus individuals were not directly affected.

No further failures occurred until September 2008, a month that saw tumultuous events for money funds. However, as noted above, other failures were only averted by infusions of capital from the fund sponsors.

==September 2008==

Money market funds increasingly became important to the wholesale money market leading up to the crisis. Their purchases of asset-backed securities and large-scale funding of foreign banks&#x27; short-term US-denominated debt put the funds in a pivotal position in the marketplace.

The week of September 15–19, 2008, was very turbulent for money funds and a key part of financial markets seizing up.

===Events===
On Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. On Tuesday, September 16, The Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck when its shares fell to 97 cents after writing off debt issued by Lehman Brothers.

Continuing investor anxiety as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and other pending financial troubles caused significant redemptions from money funds in general, as investors redeemed their holdings and funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on redemptions. Through Wednesday, September 17, prime institutional funds saw substantial redemptions. Retail funds saw net inflows of $4 billion, for a net capital outflow from all funds of $169 billion to $3.4 trillion (5%).

In response, on Friday, September 19, the US Department of the Treasury announced an optional program to &quot;insure the holdings of any publicly offered eligible money market mutual fund—both retail and institutional—that pays a fee to participate in the program&quot;. The insurance guaranteed that if a covered fund had broken the buck, it would have been restored to $1 NAV. The program was similar to the FDIC, in that it insured deposit-like holdings and sought to prevent runs on the bank. The guarantee was backed by assets of the Treasury Department&#x27;s Exchange Stabilization Fund, up to a maximum of $50 billion. This program only covered assets invested in funds before September 19, and those who sold equities, for example, during the subsequent market crash and parked their assets in money funds, were at risk. The program immediately stabilized the system and stanched the outflows, but drew criticism from banking organizations, including the Independent Community Bankers of America and American Bankers Association, who expected funds to drain out of bank deposits and into newly insured money funds, as these latter would combine higher yields with insurance. The guarantee program ended on September 18, 2009, after one year, with no losses and generated $1.2 billion (~$ in ) in revenue from the participation fees.

===Analysis===
The crisis, which eventually became the catalyst for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed into a run on money funds: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their short-term debt, potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, and do not have cash on hand to pay it back, they will default on their obligations, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression.

The drop in demand resulted in a &quot;buyers strike&quot;, as money funds could not (because of redemptions) or would not (because of fear of redemptions) buy commercial paper, driving yields up dramatically: from around 2% the previous week to 8%, and funds put their money in Treasuries, driving their yields close to 0%.

This is a bank run in the sense that there is a mismatch in maturities, and thus a money fund is a &quot;virtual bank&quot;: the assets of money funds, while short term, nonetheless typically have maturities of several months, while investors can request redemption at any time, without waiting for obligations to come due. Thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions, the assets may be liquidated in a fire sale, depressing their sale price.

An earlier crisis occurred in 2007–2008, where the demand for asset-backed commercial paper dropped, causing the collapse of some structured investment vehicles. As a result of the events, the Reserve Fund liquidated, paying shareholders 99.1 cents per share.

== Statistics ==
The Investment Company Institute reports statistics on money funds weekly as part of its mutual fund statistics, as part of its industry statistics, including total assets and net flows, both for institutional and retail funds. It also provides annual reports in the ICI Fact Book.

At the end of 2011, there were 632 money market funds in operation, with total assets of nearly US$2.7 trillion. Of this $2.7 trillion, retail money market funds had $940 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). Institutional funds had $1.75 trillion under management.

== Types and size of money funds ==

In the United States, the fund industry and its largest trade organization, the Investment Company Institute, generally categorize money funds into the type of investment strategy: Prime, Treasury or Tax-exempt as well as distribution channel/investor: Institutional or Retail.

=== Prime money fund ===
A fund that invests generally in variable-rate debt and commercial paper of corporations and securities of the US government and agencies. Can be considered of any money fund that is not a Treasury or Tax-exempt fund.

=== Government and Treasury money funds ===
A Government money fund (as of the SEC&#x27;s July 24, 2014 rule release) is one that invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are &quot;collateralized fully&quot; (i.e., collateralized by cash or government securities). A Treasury fund is a type of government money fund that invests in US Treasury Bills, Bonds and Notes.

=== Tax-exempt money fund ===
The fund invests primarily in obligations of state and local jurisdictions (&quot;municipal securities&quot;) generally exempt from US Federal Income Tax (and to some extent state income taxes).

=== Institutional money fund ===
Institutional money funds are high minimum investment, low expense share classes that are marketed to corporations, governments, or fiduciaries. They are often set up so that money is swept to them overnight from a company&#x27;s main operating accounts. Large national chains often have many accounts with banks all across the country, but electronically pull a majority of funds on deposit with them to a concentrated money market fund.

=== Retail money fund ===
Retail money funds are offered primarily to individuals. Retail money market funds hold roughly 33% of all money market fund assets.

Fund yields are typically somewhat higher than bank savings accounts, however these are different products with differing risks (e.g., money fund accounts are not insured and are not deposit accounts). Since retail funds generally have higher servicing needs and thus expenses than institutional funds, their yields are generally lower than institutional funds.

SEC rule amendments released July 24, 2014, have &#x27;improved&#x27; the definition of a retail money fund to be one that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit its shareholders to natural persons.

=== Money fund sizes ===

As of February 2025 total money market fund assets were $6.9 trillion including $4.1 trillion held by institutional investors and nearly $2.8 trillion held by retail investors. The vast majority of those assets were held in government securities. Among the largest companies offering institutional money funds are JPmorgan, BlackRock, Western Asset, Federated Investors, Bank of America, Dreyfus, AIM and Evergreen (Wachovia). The largest retail money fund providers include: Fidelity, Vanguard, and Schwab.

== Similar investments ==

=== Money market accounts ===
Banks in the United States offer savings and money market &quot;deposit accounts&quot;, but these should not be confused with money &quot;mutual funds&quot;. These bank accounts offer higher yields than traditional passbook savings accounts, but often with higher minimum balance requirements and limited transactions. A money market account may refer to a money market mutual fund, a bank money market deposit account (MMDA) or a brokerage sweep free credit balance.

===Ultrashort bond funds===
Ultrashort bond funds are mutual funds, similar to money market funds, that, as the name implies, invest in bonds with extremely short maturities. Unlike money market funds, however, there are no restrictions on the quality of the investments they hold. Instead, ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return. Since these high-risk securities can experience large swings in price or even default, ultrashort bond funds, unlike money market funds, do not seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and may lose money or dip below the $1.00 mark in the short term. Finally, because they invest in lower quality securities, ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of 2007–2010.

=== Enhanced cash funds ===
Enhanced cash funds are bond funds similar to money market funds, in that they aim to provide liquidity and principal preservation, but which:
* Invest in a wider variety of assets, and do not meet the restrictions of SEC Rule 2a-7;
* Aim for higher returns;
* Have less liquidity;
* Do not aim as strongly for stable NAV.

Enhanced cash funds will typically invest some of their portfolio in the same assets as money market funds, but others in riskier, higher yielding, less liquid assets such as:
* Lower-rated bonds;
* Longer maturity;
* Foreign currency–denominated debt;
* Asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP);
* Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs);
* Structured investment vehicles (SIVs).

In general, the NAV will stay close to $1, but is expected to fluctuate above and below, and will break the buck more often. Different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash – some consider preservation of principal as paramount, and thus take few risks, while others see these as more bond-like, and an opportunity to increase yield without necessarily preserving principal. These are typically available only to institutional investors, not retail investors.

The purpose of enhanced cash funds is not to replace money markets, but to fit in the continuum between cash and bonds – to provide a higher yielding investment for more permanent cash. That is, within one&#x27;s asset allocation, one has a continuum between cash and long-term investments:
* Cash – most liquid and least risky, but low yielding;
* Money markets / cash equivalents;
* Enhanced cash;
* Long-term bonds and other non-cash long-term investments – least liquid and most risky, but highest yielding.

Enhanced cash funds were developed due to low spreads in traditional cash equivalents.

There are also funds which are billed as &quot;money market funds&quot;, but are not 2a-7 funds (do not meet the requirements of the rule). In addition to 2a-7 eligible securities, these funds invest in Eurodollars and repos (repurchase agreements), which are similarly liquid and stable to 2a-7 eligible securities, but are not allowed under the regulations.

==Systemic risk and global regulatory reform==
=== US regulatory reform ===
A deconstruction of the September 2008 events around money market funds, and the resulting fear, panic, contagion, classic bank run, emergency need for substantial external propping up, etc. revealed that the US regulatory system covering the basic extension of credit has had substantial flaws that in hindsight date back at least two decades.

It has long been understood that regulation around the extension of credit requires substantial levels of integrity throughout the system. To the extent regulation can help insure that base levels of integrity persist throughout the chain, from borrower to lender, and it curtails the overall extension of credit to reasonable levels, episodic financial crisis may be averted.

In the 1970s, money market funds began disintermediating banks from their classic interposition between savers and borrowers. The funds provided a more direct link, with less overhead. Large banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Notably, the Fed is itself owned by the large &quot;private&quot; banks, and controls the overall supply of money in the United States. The OCC is housed within the Treasury Department, which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multi-trillion dollar debt of the US government. The overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs. actual ongoing tax receipts. Unquestionably, the private banking industry, bank regulation, the national debt, and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected. Interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the Fed, and inflation (all else being equal) allows today&#x27;s fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars. The third major bank regulator, designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that are failing, with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself. They also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits.

From the outset, money market funds fell under the jurisdiction of the SEC as they appeared to be more like &quot;investments&quot; (most similar to traditional stocks and bonds) vs. &quot;deposits and loans&quot; (cash and &quot;cash equivalents&quot; the domain of the bankers). Although money market funds are quite close to and are often accounted for as &quot;cash equivalents&quot; their main regulator, the SEC, has zero mandate to control the supply of money, limit the overall extension of credit, mitigate against boom and bust cycles, etc. The SEC&#x27;s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk, and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets. After adequate disclosure, the SEC adopts a hands off, &quot;let the buyer beware&quot; attitude.

To many retail investors, money market funds are confusingly similar to traditional bank demand deposits. Virtually all large money market funds offer check writing, ACH transfers, wiring of funds, associated debit and credit cards, detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions, copies of canceled checks, etc. This makes it appear that &quot;cash&quot; is actually in the individual&#x27;s account. With net asset values reported flat at $1.00, despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets, an impression of rock solid stability is maintained. To help maintain this impression, money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses, or cut their management fee, on an ad hoc and informal basis, to maintain that solid appearance of stability.

To illustrate the various blending and blurring of functions between classic banking and investing activities at money market funds, a simplified example will help. Imagine only retail &quot;depositors&quot; on one end, and S&amp;P 500 corporations borrowing through the commercial paper market on the other. The depositors assume:
* Extremely short duration (60 days or less)
* Extremely broad diversification (hundreds, if not thousands of positions)
* Very high grade investments.
After 10–20 years of stability the &quot;depositors&quot; here assume safety, and move all cash to money markets, enjoying the higher interest rates.

On the borrowing end, after 10–20 years, the S&amp;P 500 corporations become extremely accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, which are very stable. Initially, perhaps they only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed to be available to them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year. In these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs. They were however dependent on these sources to be available to them, as needed, on an immediate daily basis.

Over time, money market fund &quot;depositors&quot; felt more and more secure, and not really at risk. Likewise, on the other end, corporations saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper. Using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets. This expands credit. It&#x27;s also over time clearly &quot;long-term borrowing&quot; on one end, funded by an &quot;on-demand&quot; depositor on the other, with some substantial obfuscation as to what is ultimately going on in between.

In the wake of the crisis two solutions have been proposed. One, repeatedly supported over the long term by the GAO and others is to consolidate the US financial industry regulators. A step along this line has been the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to address systemic risk issues that have in the past, as amply illustrated by the money market fund crisis above, fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators. Proposals to merge the SEC and CFTC have also been made.

A second solution, more focused on money market funds directly, is to re-regulate them to address the common misunderstandings, and to ensure that money market &quot;depositors&quot;, who enjoy greater interest rates, thoroughly understand the actual risk they are undertaking. These risks include substantial interconnectedness between and among money market participants, and various other substantial systemic risks factors.

One solution is to report to money market &quot;depositors&quot; the actual, floating net asset value. This disclosure has come under strong opposition by Fidelity Investments, The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and the US Chamber of Commerce as well as others.

The SEC would normally be the regulator to address the risks to investors taken by money market funds, however to date the SEC has been internally politically gridlocked. The SEC is controlled by five commissioners, no more than three of which may be the same political party. They are also strongly enmeshed with the current mutual fund industry, and are largely divorced from traditional banking industry regulation. As such, the SEC is not concerned over overall credit extension, money supply, or bringing shadow banking under the regulatory umbrella of effective credit regulation.

As the SEC was gridlocked, the Financial Stability Oversight Council promulgated its own suggested money market reforms and threatens to move forward if the SEC doesn&#x27;t button it up with an acceptable solution of their own on a timely basis. The SEC has argued vociferously that this is &quot;their area&quot; and FSOC should back off and let them handle it, a viewpoint shared by four former SEC chairmen, Roderick Hills, David Ruder, Richard Breeden, and Harvey Pitt, and two former commissioners, Roel Campos and Paul S. Atkins.

=== US Reform: SEC Rule Amendments released July 24, 2014 ===

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued final rules that are designed to address money funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits.

There are several key components:

Floating NAV required of institutional non-government money funds

The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted these funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable NAV, i.e., they will have to transact sales and redemptions as a market value-based or &quot;floating&quot; NAV, rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000).

Fees and gates

The SEC is giving money fund boards of directors the discretion whether to impose a liquidity fee if a fund&#x27;s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and/or to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to &quot;gate&quot; funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund&#x27;s weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund&#x27;s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund.

Other provisions

In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Additionally, stress testing will be required and a key focus will be placed on the funds ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least 10%. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC.

=== EU regulatory reform ===
In parallel with the US Reform, the EU completed drafting of a similar regulation for the money market fund product.

On June 30, 2017, Regulation (EU) 2017/1131 for money market funds was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, introducing new rules for MMFs domiciled, managed or marketed in the European Union. This entered into effect in March 2019. The regulation introduces four new categories of fund structures for MMFs: 

* Public Debt Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) MMFs are short-term MMFs. Funds must invest 99.5% in government assets. Units in the fund are purchased or redeemed at a constant price rounded to the nearest percentage point. 
* Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) MMFs are short-term MMFs. Funds around are purchased or redeemed at a constant price so long as the value of the underlying assets do not deviate by more than 0.2% (20bit/s) from par (i.e. 1.00).
* Short Term Variable NAV – Short-term Variable Net Asset Value (VNAV) MMFs are primarily invested in money market instruments, deposits and other MMFs. Funds are subject to looser liquidity rules than Public Debt CNAV and LVNAV funds. Units in the funds are purchased or redeemed at a variable price calculated to the equivalent of at least four significant figures (e.g. 10,000.00).
* Standard Variable NAV VNAV– Standard MMFs must be VNAV funds. Funds are primarily invested in money market instruments, deposits and other short-term assets. Funds are subject to looser liquidity rules than Public Debt CNAV and LVNAV funds AND may invest in assets of much longer maturity. Units in the funds are purchased or redeemed at a variable price calculated to the equivalent of at least four significant figures (e.g. 10,000.00).

Although the starting products were similar, there are now considerable differences between US and EU MMFs. Whilst EU MMF investors mostly moved to successor fund types, investors in US MMFs undertook a huge and persisting switch from Prime into Government MMF. 

The EU MMF Regulation does not make any reference to either fund or portfolio external credit rating requirements. Throughout the transition EU MMFs overwhelmingly retained their existing ratings, and the credit rating agencies have confirmed their commitment to the MMF-specific rating criteria they each maintain.

A major difference in scope is that, on a like-for-like basis, US MMFs may be compared only to EU short-term MMFs.

<doc id="1137329" wikidata="Q2449842" url="?curid=1137329" title="Suspicious Minds">
<text>&quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; is a 1968 song written and first recorded by the American songwriter Mark James. After this recording failed commercially, it was recorded by Elvis Presley with the producer Chips Moman. Presley&#x27;s version reached No.1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, his 18th and final no. 1 single on that chart. In 1999, Presley&#x27;s RCA Victor Records version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

== Song ==
The song is about a mistrusting and dysfunctional relationship, and the need of the characters to overcome their issues in order to maintain it. Written in 1968 by Mark James, who was also the co-writer of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; (which Elvis Presley would later record), the song was first recorded and released by James on Scepter Records in 1968. Chips Moman had asked James to come to Memphis to write songs for American Sound Studio. At the time, James was residing in Houston. He had written three songs that became No.1 hits in the Southern United States. American Sound Studio was gaining a reputation in the industry, as the Box Tops had just recorded &quot;The Letter&quot; there, so James relocated to Memphis.

James said that late one night, he was fooling around on his Fender guitar and using his Hammond organ pedals for a bass line and came up with what he thought was a catchy melody. At the time, he was married to his first wife Shirley Yates but still had feelings for his childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston. James&#x27;s wife had suspicions about his feelings. He felt it was a confusing time for him and that all three were &quot;caught in this trap that they could not walk out of&quot;. At the recording session, James sang the lead vocals and the studio band backed him; Moman produced. The horns, strings, and vocals of the Holladay Sisters were later overdubbed. After the tape was mixed, James and Moman flew to New York, where James&#x27;s manager had contacts with Scepter Records. The label loved the song and put it out, but Scepter did not have the money to promote new artists and the song did not make the charts.

Later that year, Don Crews, Moman&#x27;s partner, told James that Presley had booked their studio to record what would become the &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; album. Crews kept asking James if he had any songs that would be right for Presley. James felt Presley needed a mature rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll song to bring him back, as Tom Jones was a popular artist at the time. Crews and James thought of &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; and James began urging others to get Presley to hear it. Though James&#x27;s recording had not been commercially successful, upon reviewing the song, Presley decided he could turn it into a hit.

== Elvis Presley version ==
=== Background ===
Presley had not recorded in Memphis since 1955. Presley&#x27;s 1969 recordings at American Sound Studio were a direct consequence of the &quot;&#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot;, that interested Chips Moman in producing recordings in Presley&#x27;s new style; he was making his comeback to the Memphis musical scene by recording rock, gospel, country, rhythm &amp; blues, and soul. Marty Lacker, a close friend of Elvis, suggested the record at the studio. These sessions produced the album &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot;.

=== American Sound Studio session ===
&quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; was a product of a session that took place between 4 and 7 a.m. on Thursday, January 23, 1969. James was in Memphis, but he was not at the recording session. A few days earlier, he had walked into the recording studio during a session and sensed that Presley was uncomfortable with his presence. James did not want to jinx the song, so he stayed away. When he heard the track the day after it was recorded, he initially thought it sounded too slow. When he later heard the embellished version, he said he was blown away. In later years, whenever Presley saw James, he would cross the room to say hello.

Production of the song was nearly scuttled over a copyright dispute. Presley&#x27;s business people Hill &amp; Range said they wanted half of Moman&#x27;s publishing rights. Moman accused them of stealing and threatened to halt the recording session. Harry Jenkins of RCA agreed with Moman because he sensed that &quot;the song would be a big hit and there would be plenty to go around&quot;.
The songs &quot;I&#x27;ll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms)&quot;, &quot;Without Love (There Is Nothing)&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; were recorded in the same session. On August 7, &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; was again overdubbed to stereo and mono in Las Vegas, where the final master was produced. The song&#x27;s time signature changes in the bridge section, from 4/4 to the slower 6/8, then back again to the faster 4/4 rhythm. The instrumental arrangement uses an electric guitar, bass guitar, organ, strings, trumpets, trombones, and drums. As &quot;Parade&quot; magazine wrote in a survey of some of Presley&#x27;s biggest hits, the recording &quot;boasts one of the most innovative arrangements in Elvis&#x27; career ... two time-signature changes, a jangling electric guitar, spiraling strings, pumping horns and a barreling backup choir&quot;.

RCA staff producer Felton Jarvis decided to add a fade-out to the song starting at 3:36 and lasting for nearly 15 seconds before fading back in. The first verse then continues repeatedly until the song completely fades out at 4:22. In a 2012 interview with Marc Myers of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Moman disclosed that Jarvis was never happy with Presley recording at American Sound Studio, saying &quot;it was a control thing&quot;. He added: &quot;So when Jarvis took the tape of &#x27;Suspicious Minds&#x27;, he added this crazy 15-second fade toward the end, like the song was ending, and brought it back by overdubbing to extend it. I have no idea why he did that, but he messed it up. It was like a scar. None of which mattered. Soon after the song was released, Elvis was back on top of the charts.&quot;

Future Grateful Dead vocalist Donna Jean Godchaux sang backing vocals on the track.

&quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; was one of the singles that revived Presley&#x27;s chart success in the U.S., following his &quot;&#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot;. It was his 18th and last &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No.1 single in the United States. In December 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 91 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Session guitarist Reggie Young played on both the James and Presley versions.

The song was later included on the legacy edition of &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; and the Follow That Dream reissue of &quot;Back In Memphis&quot;.

== Fine Young Cannibals version ==

In 1986, the band Fine Young Cannibals&#x27; cover version, which features backing vocals by Jimmy Somerville, reached No. 8 on the UK Singles Chart. It was filmed in black and white and is mostly shown that way, only colorized following the bridge section. It pays homage to Elvis Presley in its monochromaticity (common during his early career) and the shiny spangled suits the band wears in the second half.

== Warwick, Jennings and Staton versions ==
Dee Dee Warwick, Dionne Warwick&#x27;s sister, covered &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; while Elvis Presley&#x27;s version was still on the charts. Warwick&#x27;s version was a minor U.S. pop hit, peaking at No. 80 in 1970. It reached No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for May 8, 1971.

Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter recorded the song for RCA in 1970. Their version reached No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country chart in November of that year. The Jennings-Colter version was re-released by RCA in 1976, topping out at No. 2, and was included on the album &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot; that same year. Their version was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards.

Candi Staton had a No. 31 UK hit with her revival in 1982.

<text>Bulmer Cavern is New Zealand&#x27;s longest cave system, running for through Mount Owen in the Tasman region of the northwest South Island. John Patterson discovered the cave on New Year&#x27;s Day 1984, by dropping a rock down and counting the seconds until it reached the bottom.

Bulmer Cavern was the location of a major cave rescue effort in 1998, when it took 80 cavers several days to extract another caver who had fallen and broken his jaw deep in the cavern.

<doc id="1137333" wikidata="Q2302468" url="?curid=1137333" title="Meridian Hall (Toronto)">
<text>Meridian Hall is a performing arts venue in Toronto, Ontario, and it is the country&#x27;s largest soft-seat theatre. The facility was constructed for the City of Toronto municipal government and is currently managed by TO Live, an arms-length agency and registered charity created by the city. Located at 1 Front Street East, the venue opened as the O&#x27;Keefe Centre on October 1, 1960. From 1996 to 2007, the building was known as the Hummingbird Centre for the Performing Arts. From 2007 to 2019, it was known as the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts. On September 15, 2019, it was re-branded as Meridian Hall.

In 2008, the City of Toronto designated the theatre a heritage building. That year, it also underwent renovations to restore features such as the marquee canopy and York Wilson&#x27;s lobby mural, &quot;The Seven Lively Arts&quot;. Restoration of the wood, brass and marble was undertaken, along with audience seating, flooring upgrades, new washrooms and reconfigured lobby spaces. Following two years of renovations and restoration work, the building reopened on October 1, 2010, fifty years to the date of the first opening night performance.

==History==
The Centre was built on land formerly occupied by a series of commercial buildings, including the Canadian Consolidated Rubber Company, and previously it was the site of the Great Western Railway Terminal (later the Toronto Wholesale Fruit Market).

The idea for a performing arts centre that could serve the needs of an increasingly dynamic city predates the building&#x27;s opening by almost 20 years. In the mid-1940s, Nathan Phillips issued a challenge to Toronto industrialists to underwrite the cost of a multipurpose centre for theatre, music and dance. Response to Phillips&#x27; challenge was not immediate. E.P. Taylor, the racehorse-loving head of Canadian Breweries, which owned O&#x27;Keefe Brewing, offered in early 1955 to build a performing arts centre that would not only serve the needs of local institutions but increase the diversity of entertainment options available in Toronto. Toronto City Council immediately accepted the proposal in principle, but not until 1958 was the project finally approved to be built. Among others, United Church spokesmen opposed the idea that money from the sale of beer would be used for community development. Taylor assigned one of his key executives, Hugh Walker, to oversee building what was to be known, during its first 36 years, as the O&#x27;Keefe Centre.
The O&#x27;Keefe Centre opened on October 1, 1960, with a red-carpet gala. The first production was Alexander H. Cohen&#x27;s production of the pre-Broadway premiere of Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s &quot;Camelot&quot;, starring Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet. Camelot was followed by musical productions featuring such artists as Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Angela Lansbury, Alfred Drake, Yul Brynner, Carol Channing, Pearl Bailey, Katharine Hepburn and Rudolf Nureyev.

Popular music artists including Bob Dylan, Janet Jackson, Elton John, Steve Earle, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello (November 1978), David Bowie (June 1974), Lou Reed (June 2000), and bands such as The Grateful Dead, The Who, Jefferson Airplane (August 1967), Led Zeppelin (November 1969), Radiohead (June 2006), The Carpenters, The Clash (September 1979) and Beastie Boys (September 2007) played concerts at the performing arts venue.

Other artists who have performed on the arts venue&#x27;s stage in a range of solo shows, revues and jazz spectaculars include: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Marlene Dietrich, Diana Ross, Anne Murray, Tom Jones, Danny Kaye, Judy Garland, Sammy Davis Jr., Bill Cosby, Jack Benny, Liza Minnelli and Liberace. The venue has also played host to several large-scale ballet and dance performances: the National Ballet of Canada held seasonal performances at the venue from 1964 to 2006, and the venue has also seen frequent visits by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. The venue has also welcomed a wide range of international dance companies such as Les Ballets Africains, Britain&#x27;s Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Dutch National Ballet, the National Ballet of Cuba, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ballet Folklorico of Mexico, as well as the Kirov and Bolshoi Ballet companies from the then-Soviet Union. It was during a 1974 Bolshoi visit that a young Mikhail Baryshnikov defected from the Soviet Union by escaping the venue into a waiting getaway car, aided by later Jim Peterson and businessman Tim Stewart.

Like The National Ballet, The Canadian Opera Company made the Centre its home stage, from as early as 1961 to 2006. Many of Canada&#x27;s greatest singers, as well as many international opera stars, have performed for Centre audiences in COC productions. In addition, although touring opera is now rare, in earlier days the performing arts venue played host to The Met and to such well-known performers as Birgit Nilsson, Plácido Domingo and Renata Scotto.
In early February 1996, the facility was renamed the Hummingbird Centre in recognition of a major gift from a Canadian software company, Hummingbird Communications Ltd. The $5-million donation allowed the Centre to undertake a number of capital improvements and repairs, including the installation of an elevator and an acoustic reinforcement system for the auditorium. In October 2006, OpenText acquired Hummingbird and declined to renew its contract with the centre. In September 2007, Sony bought the naming rights to the Centre for $10-million, and a ten-year partnership was born. When the Ballet and Opera moved to the Four Seasons Centre in 2006, it left a hole in the theatre&#x27;s schedule. At this point, programming shifted to a multicultural schedule by include more content appealing to Toronto&#x27;s many ethnic diasporas. Notable performances that reflect this mandate include &quot;The Last Empress&quot; (a Korean historical musical), the Virsky Ukrainian Dance Company, South Africa&#x27;s Soweto Gospel Choir, The Shaolin Warriors, Ricky Cheng, David Rudder &amp; Friends and Club Tropicana.

In 2006, the performing arts venue received approval from the City of Toronto for the development of a high-rise condominium building beside the Centre. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind (who also designed the Crystal addition to the Royal Ontario Museum), the L Tower was built on the southwest corner of the property. The Sony Centre closed on 26 June 2008 to begin the theatre renovations, which were unveiled on October 1, 2010.

In June 2012, the Sony Centre hosted the Canadian premiere of the Philip Glass and Robert Wilson opera &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;.

On 21 January 2019, the City of Toronto announced a C$30.75 million 15-year partnership with Meridian Credit Union, re-branding the Sony Centre into Meridian Hall, and the Toronto Centre for the Arts into the Meridian Arts Centre. The arts venues formally adopted their new names on September 15, 2019.

Designed by Peter Dickinson, the performing arts venue is an example of a mid-twentieth century modern performing arts venue. It is four stories high and is broken up into three main forms: the entrance block, auditorium and fly tower. The central form of the building is highly symmetrical with an open floor plan. Structurally, the performing arts venue uses steel trusses and concrete to hold the majority of the building together. In addition to the structure, the performing arts venue&#x27;s auditorium houses an acoustic system, which gives the audience the sense that the sound is surrounding them.

When it comes to materiality, the majority of the original materials are still in the building today. Materials used include: Alabama limestone, glazing, granite, copper, bronze, Carrara marble, carpet, cherry plywood panels and Brazilian rosewood. The performing arts venue is very diverse in its range of materials and employs them in such a way that they are not overshadowed by the unique forms of the building.

The interior also features a grand double-height foyer with coffered ceilings, a wide mural by the famous Toronto-born artist York Wilson, cantilevered stairs, polished bronze auditorium doors, and a fan-shaped auditorium with a curving balcony.

<doc id="1137338" wikidata="Q1405940" url="?curid=1137338" title="Kustom Kulture">
<text>Kustom Kulture is the artworks, vehicles, hairstyles, and fashions of those who have driven and built custom cars and motorcycles in the United States of America from the 1950s through today. 
It was born out of the hot rod culture of Southern California of the 1960s.

In the early days of hot rodding, many fashions and styles developed. Over time, each of these distinct styles of customizing have blended together and reshaped American culture. Artists such as Von Dutch (Kenny Howard), Robert Williams, and custom car builder Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth; along with Lyle Fisk, Dean Jeffries; hot rod and lowrider customizers such as the Barris Brothers (Sam and George Barris); along with numerous tattoo artists, automobile painters, and movies and television shows such as &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;The Munsters&quot; (The Munster Koach, DRAG-U-LA) have all helped to form what is known as Kustom Kulture.

Kustom Kulture is usually identified with the greasers of the 1950s, the drag racers of the 1960s, and the lowriders of the 1970s. Other subcultures that have had an influence on Kustom Kulture are the Skinheads, mods and rockers of the 1960s, the punk rockers of the 1970s, the metal and rockabilly music, along with the scooterboys of the 1980s, and psychobilly of the 1990s. Each separate culture has added their own customizations to the cars, their own fashions, influenced the music, and added their own ideas of what is cool, what is acceptable, and what is not. Everything from wild pinstriped paintjobs, to choptop Mercurys, to custom Harley-Davidson and Triumph motorcycles, to metal-flake and black primer paint jobs, along with music, cartoons, and monster movies have influenced what defines anyone and anything who is part of this automobile subculture.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Kustom Kulture had taken on a rebirth of American subcultures from the 1950s and 1960s with DIY activities. Each style is distinct, and has its roots in American automobile history. Many styles that would not have tolerated each other in the past now come together in large car shows.

==Kustom Graphics==
The rebirth of Kustom Kulture has seen the use of the term “Kustom Graphics” to describe the style of artwork associated with the subculture when applied to posters, flyers, T-shirts and logos.

== Sweden, Norway and Finland ==
Locals in these countries, influenced by American culture, have created a local hot rod culture which is vibrant in Sweden, Norway and Finland where enthusiasts gather at meetings such as Power Big Meet and clubs like Wheels and Wings in Varberg, Sweden have established themselves in Hot Rod culture. Since there is very little &quot;vintage tin&quot; the hot rods in Sweden are generally made with a home made chassis (usually a Model T or A replica), with a Jaguar (or Volvo 240) rear axle, a small block V8, and fiberglass tub, but some have been built using for instance a Volvo Duett chassis. Because the Swedish regulations required a crash test even for custom-built passenger cars between 1969 and 1982, the Duett option was preferred, since it was considered a rebodied Duett rather than a new vehicle.

Some 1950s and 1960s cars are also hot rodded, like Morris Minor, Ford Anglia, Volvo Amazon, Ford Cortina, &#x27;57 Chevy, to name but a few. These are known as custom cars (sometimes spelled Kustom).

<doc id="1137340" wikidata="Q7228652" url="?curid=1137340" title="Pooling (resource management)">
<text>In resource management, pooling is the grouping together of resources (assets, equipment, personnel, effort, etc.) for the purposes of maximizing advantage or minimizing risk to the users. The term is used in finance, computing and equipment management.

==Finance==
Pooling is the grouping together of assets, and related strategies for minimizing risk. For example:
*Asset-backed securities (ABS) is a security whose income payments are backed by a specified pool of underlying assets. 
*Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is a type of asset-backed security whereas the underlying assets are mortgages.

Debt instruments with similar characteristics can be pooled into a new security, for example:
*Collateralized debt obligations (CDO) is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS).
*Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO) is a type of complex debt security that repackages and directs the payments of principal and interest from a collateral pool to different types and maturities of securities, thereby meeting investor needs.

In general, pooling different assets or debt-like obligations into a new security is called securitization, a practice commonly used by structured finance.
==Accounting==
*In acquisition, pooling of interest was a merger-accounting method that was taken out of the market in the United States by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on June 30, 2001. The method combines the book value of assets and liabilities of the two companies to create the new balance sheet of the combined companies.

==Supply chain management==
*Intergovernmental risk pool is the use of the risk pool risk management technique commonly practiced by private insurance companies, but applied to public entities (e.g. made up of government agencies, school districts, county governments and municipalities) who come together to form a pool to provide protection against catastrophic risks such as floods or earthquakes.

==Computing==
Pooling IT (equipment and staff) resources involves virtualization of typical IT stacks server, storage and networking (but also on the level of datacenter power and cooling). Users benefit from lower individual investments since resources are shared. Although shared infrastructures have huge benefits potential issues on the environment have impact on the complete environment. A thorough analysis of the infrastructure is recommended to identify potential single point of failure (SPOF). One may opt for &#x27;private&#x27; instances (private clouds) for specific needs or for specific reasons. On the level of resource pooling, bigger suppliers tend to have the benefit of being able to provide shared support environments with round the clock service. Do you prefer access to a service desk round the clock with potential less expertise or do you want to rely on a single support engineer (who is &#x27;on duty&#x27; during off peak hours)&quot;

*Memory pooling is the use of a pool for memory management that allows dynamic memory allocation by preallocating a number of memory blocks with the same size called the memory pool, and is an alternative to dynamic memory allocation by techniques such as malloc and C++&#x27;s operator new which can suffer from fragmentation because of variable block sizes.
*Thread pooling is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program by maintaining a pool of multiple threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by a supervising program, and increases performance and avoids latency due to frequent creation and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks
*Object pooling is a software design pattern that keeps a pool of initialized objects ready that are ready to be used, rather than allocating and destroying them on demand. 
*Connection pooling in computer science is a caching technique used to enhance the performance of executing commands on a database.

The resource management concepts of pooling can easily be abstracted and virtualized.

==Equipment==
Pooling of equipment is used to maintain &quot;ready for use&quot; equipment while damaged or dirty equipment is repaired and cleaned, by replacing it with an identical piece of equipment from the pool.

==Automotive==
Carpooling is sharing of car journeys so that not all of the persons need to drive to a location themselves.

<doc id="1137342" wikidata="Q1422835" url="?curid=1137342" title="Acoustic reflex">
<text>The acoustic reflex (also known as the stapedius reflex, stapedial reflex, auditory reflex, middle-ear-muscle reflex (MEM reflex, MEMR), attenuation reflex, cochleostapedial reflex or intra-aural reflex) is an involuntary muscle contraction that occurs in the middle ear in response to loud sound stimuli or when the person starts to vocalize.

When presented with an intense sound stimulus, the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles of the ossicles contract. The stapedius stiffens the ossicular chain by pulling the stapes (stirrup) of the middle ear away from the oval window of the cochlea and the tensor tympani muscle stiffens the ossicular chain by loading the tympanic membrane when it pulls the malleus (hammer) in toward the middle ear. The reflex decreases the transmission of vibrational energy to the cochlea, where it is converted into electrical impulses to be processed by the brain.

==Acoustic reflex threshold==
The acoustic reflex threshold (ART) is the sound pressure level (SPL) from which a sound stimulus with a given frequency will trigger the acoustic reflex. The ART is a function of sound pressure level and frequency.

People with normal hearing have an acoustic reflex threshold (ART) around 70–100 dB SPL. People with conductive hearing loss (i.e., bad transmission in the middle ear) may have a greater or absent acoustic reflex threshold.

The acoustic reflex threshold is usually 10–20 dB below the discomfort threshold. However the discomfort threshold is not a relevant indicator of the harmfulness of a sound: industry workers tend to have a higher discomfort threshold, but the sound is just as harmful to their ears.

The acoustic reflex threshold can be decreased by the simultaneous presentation of a second tone (facilitator). The facilitator tone can be presented to either ear. This facilitation effect tends to be greater when the facilitator tone has a frequency lower than the frequency of the elicitor (i.e. the sound used to trigger the acoustic reflex).

==Characteristics and effects==
* For most animals, the acoustic reflex is the contraction of both middle ear muscles: the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles. However, in humans, the acoustic reflex only involves the contraction of the stapedius muscle, not the tensor tympani.
* The contraction of the stapedius muscle occurs bilaterally in normal ears, no matter which ear was exposed to the loud sound stimulation.
* The prevalence of bilateral acoustic reflexes in persons 18–30 years old is 85.3% (82.9%, 87.4%) 95th percentile confidence interval N = 3280 and in all persons 74.6% (73.2%, 75.9%) N = 15,106.
* The acoustic reflex mostly protects against low frequency sounds.
*When triggered by sounds 20 dB above the reflex threshold, the stapedius reflex decreases the intensity of the sound transmitted to the cochlea by around 15 dB.
* The acoustic reflex is also invoked when a person vocalizes. In humans, the vocalization-induced stapedius reflex reduces sound intensities reaching the inner ear by approximately 20 decibels. The reflex is triggered in anticipation of the onset of vocalization. While the vocalization-induced stapedius reflex in humans results in an approximate 20 dB reduction in transduction to the inner ear, birds have a stronger stapedius reflex that is invoked just before the bird tweets.

== Hypothesized function==
The main hypothesized function of the acoustic reflex is the protection of the organ of Corti against excessive stimulation (especially that of the lower frequencies). This protection has been demonstrated both in humans and animals, but with limited effects.

According to the article &quot;Significance of the stapedius reflex for the understanding of speech&quot;, the latency of contraction is only about 10ms, but maximum tension may not be reached for 100 ms or more.
According to the article &quot;Le traumatisme acoustique&quot;, the latency of contraction is 150 ms with noise stimulus which SPL is at the threshold (ATR), and 25–35 ms at high sound pressure levels. Indeed, the amplitude of the contraction grows with the sound pressure level stimulus.

Because of this latency, the acoustic reflex cannot protect against sudden intense noises. However, when several sudden intense noises are presented at a pace higher than 2–3 seconds of interval, the acoustic reflex is able to play a role against auditory fatigue.

Moreover, the full tension of the stapedius muscle cannot be maintained in response to continued stimulation. Indeed, the tension drops to about 50% of its maximum value after a few seconds.

In damage risk criteria for exposure to impulse noise, the acoustic reflex is integral to the Auditory Hazard Assessment Algorithm for Humans model and the Integrated Cochlear Energy models. These two models estimate the response of the basilar membrane in response to an input stimulus and summate the vibration of the segments of the basilar membrane to predict the potential risk for hearing loss. The acoustic reflex can be activated before an impulse reaches the ear through an assumed conditioned response or it can be activated after the stimulus exceeds a specific level (e.g. 134 dB).

Recent measurements of the acoustic reflex with a group of 50 subjects found that only 2 of the subjects exhibited any pre-activation of the reflex in the warned (countdown) or volitional control of the eliciting stimulus.

An alternative hypothesis for the role of the acoustic reflex is the prevention of auditory masking of high-frequencies by low-frequencies, which are predominant in natural sounds.

==Measurement==
Most of the time, the stapedius reflex is tested with tympanometry. The contraction of the stapedius muscle stiffens the middle-ear, thus decreasing middle-ear admittance; this can be measured thanks to tympanometry.
The acoustic stapedius reflex can also be recorded by means of extratympanic manometry (ETM).

The stapedial reflex can be measured with laser Doppler velocimetry. Jones et al. focused a laser on the light reflex of the manubrium in awake human subjects. The amplitude of a 500 Hz probe tone was used to monitor the vibrations of the tympanic membrane. Various elicitors were presented to the subjects: 1000 Hz tone-burst for 0.5 s at 100 dB SPL, recorded .22 caliber gunshot noise with a peak level of 110 dB SPL. The amplitude of the 500 Hz probe tone was reduced in response to the eliciting stimuli. Time constants for the rate of onset and recovery were measured to be about 113 ms for the tone and 60-69 ms for the gunshot recordings. 
As the stapedius muscle is innervated by the facial nerve, a measurement of the reflex can be used to locate the injury on the nerve. If the injury is distal to the stapedius muscle, the reflex is still functional.

A measurement of the reflex can also be used to suggest a retrocochlear lesion (e.g., vestibular schwannoma).

The acoustic reflex normally occurs only at relatively high intensities; contraction of middle ear muscles for quieter sounds can indicate ear dysfunction (e.g. tonic tensor tympani syndrome -TTTS).

The pathway involved in the acoustic reflex is complex and can involve the ossicular chain (malleus, incus and stapes), the cochlea (organ of hearing), the auditory nerve, brain stem, facial nerve, superior olivary complex, and cochlear nucleus. Consequently, the absence of an acoustic reflex, by itself, may not be conclusive in identifying the source of the problem.

<doc id="1137344" wikidata="Q7000533" url="?curid=1137344" title="Nettlebed Cave">
<text>Nettlebed Cave is a limestone cave located in the Mount Arthur region of the northwest South Island of New Zealand. The presence of ongaonga (&quot;Urtica ferox&quot;), an endemic tree nettle, near the bottom entrance gives the cave its name.

Nettlebed Cave was connected to Stormy Pot in January 2014, making the system the deepest known cave in the Southern Hemisphere. Nettlebed Cave drops below its upper entrance (Big Friendly Giant, Stormy Pot) to its lower exit (the Pearse River resurgence) and is long.

==Exploration==
Nettlebed Cave was first explored by cavers in 1969 through the dry overflow passage of a large spring pouring into the Pearse River. By 1973 of passages had been mapped. It was not until 1979 that a flowstone squeeze known as the Hinkle-horn-honking-holes was passed, making further explorations possible. Five successive Christmas expeditions (1979–80 through 1983–84) utilising underground camps at Salvation Hall and Soft Rock Cafe led to the exploration and mapping of a further .

In 1986 another cave (Blizzard Pot) was connected with Nettlebed Cave, providing an upper entrance to the system, and made the overall depth from the highest point in Blizzard Pot to the deepest point in Nettlebed Cave.

The long-sought-after connection between Nettlebed and Stormy Pot was made from the Nettlebed side on 29 February 2014, at the end of a week-long camp at Soft Rock Cafe. After a kerosene smoke test had previously indicated a likely point of connection, a team of four (Kieran McKay, Bruce Mutton, Gavin Holden and Jonathan Ravens) dug out the rubble from a choked, drafting, rift to reach the bottom of a small muddy shaft. A tight squeeze at the top of this climb was enlarged slightly with a rock hammer to emerge at the bottom of the urinal pitch for the Rover&#x27;s Return bivvi (a low sandy passage used as a temporary campsite at one of Stormy Pot&#x27;s further reaches). The team were extremely grateful for the NZSS policy of carrying out all solid human waste. The overall depth of the combined system (from the top entrance, Big Friendly Giant, to the deepest surveyed point in Nettlebed&#x27;s Midas Chambers) was later confirmed as when an accurate GPS survey of the entrance locations was undertaken in December 2015. As of December 2019, the total surveyed length of Nettlebed/Stormy Pot is .

==Pearse Resurgence==
The Pearse Resurgence is the source of the Pearse Stream, and is the resurgence point for all caves on Mt Arthur, including all water flowing in Nettlebed Cave (under normal water levels). This has been confirmed by positive dye tests from caves in the Ellis Basin to the south, from Windrift to the west, and from Nettlebed Cave itself.

On 21 March 2007, a team of international cave divers set a New Zealand cave diving record by reaching a depth of 177m (581 feet below ground level) in the Pearse Resurgence.

In 2011, divers reached depth by placing four decompression habitats along the cave main tunnel but were still unable to trace the source.

During the 2014 Wet Mules diving expedition, the Pearse was dived to a record depth of .

In 2016, Richard Harris and Dave Hurst pushed the limits of the main spring with a 13-hour dive to explore the &quot;Second Breakfast&quot; passage to a depth of before lights began to implode causing them to turn back.

In 2020, Richard Harris and Craig Challen reached a depth of in the resurgence.

<text>Allen Road, formally known as William R. Allen Road, is a short municipal expressway and arterial road in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It starts as a controlled-access expressway at Eglinton Avenue West, heading north to just south of Transit Road, then continues as an arterial road north to Kennard Avenue, where it continues as Dufferin Street. Allen Road is named after Metro Toronto chairman William R. Allen and is maintained by the City of Toronto. Landmarks along the road include the Lawrence Heights housing project, Yorkdale Shopping Centre and Downsview Park, and Downsview Airport. A section of the Line 1 Yonge–University subway is located within the median of the expressway from Eglinton Avenue to north of Wilson Avenue.

The portion south of Transit Road was originally constructed as part of the Spadina Expressway project. The Spadina was proposed in the 1950s as a north–south freeway, intended to connect downtown Toronto to the suburbs of North York and to serve the Yorkdale Shopping Centre project; it was only partially built before being cancelled in 1971 due to public opposition. Initially proposed in the 1950s as part of a network of freeways surrounding Toronto, its cancellation in 1971 ended proposals for other proposed expressways into and around Metro Toronto. Despite this, extensions were opened south to Eglinton in 1976 and north to Kennard Avenue in 1982.

In 1983, the Province of Ontario, the City of Toronto and the government of Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) agreed to a land transfer that saw a strip of land south of Eglinton, as well as the right-of-way for the proposed expressway, transferred to the city in exchange for the fully-constructed arterial extension of Highway 400 now known as Black Creek Drive. Various proposals since to extend Allen Road south of Eglinton—either above or below ground—have never gained traction, and the route remains a backlogged stub of the original proposals. Despite this, the decision to cancel the Spadina—and by extension similar expressways into downtowns—has been regarded as one of the defining moments of urban planning in Canada.

== Route description ==
Allen Road is a road located within Toronto. The four-to-eight lane route connects Eglinton Avenue West with Kennard Avenue, north of which the roadway continues as Dufferin Street. It is classified by the City of Toronto as an expressway from Eglinton Avenue to Transit Road and as a major arterial from Transit Road to Kennard Avenue. As such, bicycles and pedestrians are prohibited on the route south of Transit Road. The outermost lanes of Allen Road from Sheppard West station north to Kennard Avenue are high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV).

Allen Road begins at Eglinton Avenue West with two separate signalized intersections serving the opposing directions of travel on the expressway. The northbound lanes intersect Eglinton Avenue West to the east of Eglinton West station, while the two southbound lanes connect to Eglinton Avenue west of the station. It proceeds north to Lawrence Avenue West as a four-lane expressway with a speed limit of in the northerly direction until north of Eglinton Avenue.

The tracks of the Line 1 Yonge–University subway are situated between the carriageways in a right-of-way, with each station&#x27;s TTC bus terminal also being located between them. The roadway intersects with Lawrence Avenue West, with the ramps to and from each carriageway meeting at a set of traffic lights. North of Lawrence Avenue, the route is eight lanes, with a speed limit of . Ramps connect to and from Yorkdale Road, flanking Yorkdale station between them.
The Allen proceeds on bridges over the lanes of Highway 401, with ramps from the Allen to Highway 401 passing overhead. The interchange also serves to connect Yorkdale Road with Highway401. The exit from the northbound Allen to Highway401 serves as a ramp to both directions of Highway401, with two lanes proceeding north of Highway401. Similarly, two lanes are provided southbound over Highway401, and access from the eastbound and westbound 401 merges with the Allen south of Yorkdale Road. Access to Yorkdale Road from the eastbound 401 is provided at the partial Dufferin Street interchange to the west. The southbound ramp from the Allen to the eastbound 401 flies over the whole interchange and connects with the eastbound 401 collector lanes. The subway is situated on bridges over Highway401 between the northbound and southbound lanes.

North of Highway401, the Allen is four or six lanes. It passes over Wilson Avenue, with Wilson station being above the namesake avenue within the median of Allen Road, and meets with Transit Road at a signalized intersection. The subway diverges from the route just north of Wilson Avenue, where there is a large subway yard and bus garage known as Wilson Yard, to the west of the road. Just south of Transit Road is a partial interchange with Wilson Heights, the former northern terminus of the road until 1982.

North of Transit Road, Allen Road is an arterial road with four or six lanes. It features a concrete barrier between the opposing lanes north to a signalized intersection with Sheppard Avenue West. The speed limit along Allen Road through this section is . It continues north, with signalized intersections at Rimrock and Kennard Avenue. The road becomes Dufferin Street north of Kennard Avenue.

== History ==
=== The Spadina Expressway ===
The Spadina Expressway was one of several intraurban freeways proposed in the 1950s to crisscross Toronto. It was intended to carry commuter traffic from the Toronto suburbs north of Highway 401 into the downtown of Toronto, via the Cedarvale and Nordheimer Ravines and Spadina Road. Various versions of the proposal showed it starting to the north of North York at today&#x27;s highway 407, between Bathurst and Dufferin Streets. It then travelled south to meet highway 401 a half-mile east of Dufferin. It was cancelled due to public opposition, although not before the northern section was started and the expropriation of a number of homes.

The interchange at Highway401 evolved to a complex three-level turbine design featuring 26 bridges, the most-complex in Canada at the time. At the same time, Highway401 was being widened from four lanes into a twelve-lane highway. From Highway401 south to Eglinton, the roadway was to be in a trench, with the rapid-transit line in the middle. South of Eglinton, it continued into the Cedarvale Park below ground level. Plans were initially for the road to be on the surface of the ravines and the subway below the surface as far as Spadina Road, with a tunnel under St. Michael&#x27;s College north of St. Clair. Another plan projected the roadway to be completely underground through this stretch, on top of the subway line. From Spadina Road south of St. Clair, the roadway would be underground to its end at Davenport Road.

Various proposals for the Spadina south of Bloor Street were made. The 1969 functional design proposed an express route in the centre of Spadina Avenue, and parallel two-lane service roads on either side to provide access to properties. Other proposals included no highway south of Sussex Street, near Harbord Street.

=== 1943–1961: Planning for the route ===

By the 1940s, urban development extended past the boundaries of Toronto. It was recognized within the planning department that the farmland surrounding the city would soon be developed. In 1943, the City of Toronto Planning Board developed a plan for the area within a nine-mile radius of Yonge Street and Queen Street. It included a network of superhighways, one of which followed a similar routing to the future Spadina Expressway proposal.

In November 1947, the City of Toronto Civic Work Committee approved a plan submitted by the Toronto City Planning Board for two new arterial roads: one running east–west along the lakeshore named the Waterfront Highway and another running north–south to the west of downtown. The north–south route entailed construction of a new road from Front Street to St. Clair Avenue along the route of the existing Spadina Avenue and Spadina Road. The jog at Bloor Street connecting the two existing roads would be straightened and a new cut of the Davenport Road escarpment would be made, adjacent to Casa Loma. The proposal was added to the January1, 1948, municipal election, where it was narrowly approved by voters 34,261 to 32,078. While the proposal was adopted, the narrow approval led councillors to hold off on approval of construction.

A proposal for a highway from the northwest to downtown was developed in 1949 by the Toronto and Suburban Planning Board, part of a plan for numerous expressways in the Toronto area, including the &quot;Lakeshore Expressway&quot; (the eventual Gardiner Expressway) and Don Valley Parkway. It was to be named &quot;North West Drive&quot;, or the &quot;Spadina Road Extension&quot;. The route was laid out by two members of the board, future Metro chairman Fred Gardiner and James P. Maher, chairman of the Toronto Planning Board. The proposal died when York Township rejected the idea.

Shortly after Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) was formed in 1953, it proposed building &quot;superhighways&quot; into and out of downtown, as well as encircling the downtown with an &quot;expressway ring&quot;. The routes of the Lakeshore and Don Valley expressways were less controversial and allowed to proceed, while others were put off for further study, as they would cut through developed areas and were considered lower priority. The Spadina Expressway was first conceptualized in December 1953 and became part of the Metro official transportation plan in 1959. The original plan intended to connect a &quot;Highway403 bypass&quot; in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Highway407 in the city of Vaughan south through the borough of North York, just east of Downsview Airport, then south between Dufferin Street and Bathurst Street to Eglinton. The highway would have entered Castle Frank Brook south to St. Clair Avenue through the borough of York. It would then enter Toronto proper south through the Annex neighbourhood, connecting to the east–west Crosstown Expressway north of Dupont Street before ending at the intersection of Bloor Street and Spadina Avenue.

=== 1961–1962: Proposals and approval ===
The Spadina was considered critical for the development of the planned ($ in dollars) Yorkdale Shopping Centre, southwest of the Highway401 interchange, and the developers of the mall threatened to cancel its construction if the highway was not approved. Only after Metro Council formally approved the expressway project in 1962 did the land owners, T. Eaton Co. Limited, commit to its construction. The estimated cost of the expressway in 1961 was ($ in dollars), By 1969, the cost had risen to $136.2million ($ in dollars). On December12, 1961, Metro Council approved the Spadina Expressway project in a 13 to 8 vote, committing $5million to the project. This covered the cost of the first section from Lawrence Avenue to Highway401. However, council also deferred approving the whole route.

Opposition to the project was already mounting by this point. In 1960, members of the Cedarvale Ratepayers Association disrupted meetings of the Metro Toronto Roads Committee discussing the project. York Township, which became the Borough of York, opposed the construction of the highway, particularly through the Cedarvale Ravine, characterized as &quot;the only park area west of Bathurst Street and north of St. Clair Avenue available to serve 100,000citizens&quot;. Members of the association proposed studying the need for the expressway as well as studying an alternate route along Dufferin Street. The Roads Committee turned down their requests, and York Township threatened to go to the Supreme Court of Canada to block Metro from taking their park. Metro chairman Fred Gardiner opined, &quot;I can&#x27;t see how anyone would allow one of 13municipalities to block an expressway.&quot;

In 1961, the Metro Roads Committee held meetings to hear submissions on the routing of the expressway. Forest Hill Village objected to the proposed route of the expressway though the village. The road and the interchange at Eglinton Avenue would require the demolition of 276 buildings and bisect the village. Forest Hill proposed a tunnel from the Cedarvale Ravine north, under Forest Hill. Gardiner, former reeve of Forest Hill, admitted that the project would be harmful to the village, &quot;but there is urgent need for an expressway to serve the northwest Metro area&quot; and that the route through the village was the only one that would allow the expressway to enter the Cedarvale Ravine. In June 1961, the section of the Spadina Expressway south of the Crosstown Expressway was cancelled. The Spadina would now terminate at an interchange with the Crosstown, and Spadina Road north of Bloor Street would be widened.

Ratepayers Associations banded together to object to the municipal expressway plan, forming the &quot;Coordinating Committee of Toronto Ratepayers Associations&quot; and the &quot;Metro Ratepayers Transportation Committee&quot;. University of Toronto professor James Acland of the Rathnelly Residents Association spoke of the futility of combining rapid transit and expressways on one route. &quot;They won&#x27;t persuade anyone to park his car and take rapid transit when there is a wonderful expressway inviting him to drive downtown.&quot; S. A. Hudson, president of the Lawrence Heights Ratepayer Association, cited figures showing the roadway would carry 10,000 vehicles into the core at rush hour, requiring for parking alone. The group placed ads in newspapers prior to the December 12, 1961, vote of Metro Council, urging the rejection of the plan. The pressure was partially effective as council voted 19 to 2 to remove the Crosstown, but approved the first stage of the Spadina by a vote of 13 to 8 while deferring a vote on construction south of Lawrence.

The vote put the whole project in doubt. The province wanted Metro council approval for the whole project before releasing any funds, but the vote covered only the Lawrence to Highway401 section. Transportation minister William Goodfellow wrote to council to state that since Metro had not voted to approve the entire project, the province would not consider connecting Spadina with Highway401. The vote to have Metro&#x27;s Road Committee study the route south of Lawrence led to the Roads Committee to hold public hearings. North York Council voted unanimously to fight for approval of the whole project. The hearings heard from more than 30 ratepayer associations. Strong support was heard from North York associations and opposition was mostly from York, Forest Hill and the City of Toronto associations. Opponents proposed a $10 auto tax and $25 truck tax to pay for the cost of Metro expressways instead of paying the costs from property taxes and wanted Metro to finish the Gardiner and Don Valley expressways first.

On February 19, 1962, Metro Roads Committed approved the whole project by a 5 to 1 vote, the only dissenter being future Toronto Mayor William Dennison. The meeting was picketed by opponents with signs proclaiming &quot;Spadina Expressway No!&quot;, &quot;Taxes at Critical Level&quot; and &quot;We are Watching How You Vote&quot;. The committee also recommended removing the Crosstown from the plan. Metro Chairman William R. Allen, whom the road would ultimately be named after, spoke in favour of the project based on the rapid transit portion of the project, which included commuter parking lots at northern stations. &quot;If this does not get the motorist out his vehicle and back to rapid transit, Metro Council cannot be blamed.&quot;

On March 6, 1962, the full Metro Council voted 14 to 8 to approve the whole project, with the Lawrence to 401 section to start construction in 1964. The approval would allow Metro to purchase lands for the project, but approval to actually construct the highway would not take place until the 1967 budget. By this time, opposition had developed on several points:

* the high cost of the project, and the tax burden
* putting the highway through a section of Cedarvale Park
* building the Spadina will make the Crosstown inevitable, leading to further demolitions in the city
* property owners whose properties would be affected
* the addition of more cars to the downtown

=== 1963–1969: Construction ===
By 1963, costs had risen to over $73million for the plan. Metro, which was also constructing the Gardiner Expressway, Don Valley Parkway and Bloor–Danforth subway lines had fallen under the scrutiny of the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) over its spending. The OMB had to approve the 1963 budget before Metro could. The Spadina was separated from the 1963 budget, and the OMB held hearings into the project. In submissions to the OMB, the townships of Forest Hill and York again objected. CCTTRA, and the CCTRA noted its objections. The OMB upheld the Spadina project. The OMB stated in its decision that the &quot;sectional interest must give way to the public need of the larger area.&quot; On the issue of the ravine parklands, the OMB stated &quot;The board should and does expect that any park land that may be lost to York Township as a result of this undertaking will be replaced, insofar as may be possible in the circumstances, by suitable alternative lands for that purpose.&quot;

Construction started in 1963 with the clearing of the route. The area north of Lawrence Avenue was open land. South of Lawrence, dozens of homes were demolished. Coinciding with the opening of the Yorkdale mall, an interim roadway was opened from Lawrence north to Yorkdale Road on February25, 1964. In 1964, Metro released another transportation plan, which proposed the Spadina route south of Bloor, again requiring the demolition of homes south of Davenport. Toronto City Council adopted an Official Plan opposing the Crosstown Expressway and the Christie Expressway completely. Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Municipal Affairs overruled the city, and modified the city&#x27;s Plan to allow for the construction of both expressways. The City and Metro were now in disagreement.

On December15, 1966, the section from Lawrence Avenue north to Transit Road was opened to traffic. Construction then started on the section south to Eglinton Avenue. York Council had dropped its opposition to the expressway and made an agreement with Metro on the use of Cedarvale Park for the expressway. This agreement provided for the creation of of park lands in the Borough of York to replace the park lands lost to the expressway trench. This plan would have meant the expropriation of homes for the replacement lands and residents of York protested the plan to the Council. The cost of the expropriation plan was an estimated $4million of construction, plus the loss of the assessment, while putting a cover over the roadway within the park would have cost $5million. The opposition led Metro to agree to building the expressway within a tunnel under the park.

As construction proceeded, opposition to the expressway grew among City of Toronto residents. In October 1969, the &quot;Stop Spadina, Save Our City Co-ordinating Committee&quot; (SSSOCCC, or &quot;Stop Spadina&quot;) was formed, under the chairmanship of University of Toronto professor Allan Powell. The group was a coalition of students, academics, politicians, ratepayer groups and business people. Notable among the opposition was urban theorist Jane Jacobs, who moved to the Annex in 1969, fresh from a battle to stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway in New York City. Marshall McLuhan, too, was opposed to the expressway and said: &quot;Toronto will commit suicide if it plunges the Spadina Expressway into its heart... our planners are 19th century men with a naive faith in an obsolete technology. In an age of software Metro planners treat people like hardware — they haven&#x27;t the faintest interest in the values of neighbourhoods or community. Their failure to learn from the mistakes of American cities will be ours too.&quot; In the 1969 civic election, three councilors were elected in Toronto on a platform of immediately ending Spadina construction: Ying Hope, William Kilbourn and John Sewell.

=== 1969–1971: Review and cancellation ===
By 1969, all but $10million of the approved $76million was spent, completing the roadway only to Lawrence Avenue, and the road bed to Eglinton Avenue. Metro learned that the project would require a further $80million for completion and halted construction and decided to review the project. The total cost of the project (including the rapid transit line) was now $237million. A trench had been dug in Cedarvale Park, and Metro Roads and Traffic Commissioner Sam Cass attempted to commit Metro to construction south of Eglinton by arranging to call for tenders in building a tunnel in the park. The call, going against Metro Council&#x27;s explicit instructions, was noticed only one day before they would be published. The call was cancelled by Metro Chairman Albert Campbell.

Stop Spadina developed its public campaign, producing a short film by McLuhan entitled &quot;The Burning Would&quot; explaining the reasons to stop the project while poking fun at expressway backers. The group also held public lectures with Jacobs and started a petition campaign. Members David and Nadine Nowlan, professors at University of Toronto, released their book &quot;The Bad Trip&quot;, an economic analysis of the project and explanation of their opposition.

Metro Council voted to apply to the OMB for permission to borrow the funds and requested that the OMB held hearings. OMB Hearings began on January 4, 1971. Opposition groups banded together under the banner of &quot;The Spadina Review Corporation&quot; and hired one of Canada&#x27;s top trial lawyers, John Josiah &quot;J. J.&quot; Robinette, to plead their case. Metro presented its case based on technical studies showing the road was needed to manage expected traffic. Council was represented by its solicitor and its witnesses included Metro and City Commissioners and American transportation planner Alan Voorhees. Opposition groups based their case on the factors of noise, pollution, destruction of homes and the expected increase of traffic the roadway would cause. Their witnesses included Jack Fensterstock of the New York City Department of Air Resources, neighbourhood residents, as well as urban planners, economists and architects. No elected officials, nor the Metro chairman, appeared to defend or oppose the project. The Board held 16 days of hearings and gave its approval by a vote of 2–1, OMB chairman J. A. Kennedy dissenting, on February 17, 1971.
The Corporation then proceeded to appeal directly to the provincial government cabinet. On June 3, 1971, the provincial government of Bill Davis withdrew its support, effectively killing the project. The province would support the new Spadina subway line extension only. Speaking in the Ontario Legislature, Davis said:

If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.

Toronto Mayor Dennison was shocked at the result. &quot;It&#x27;s shocking that a group who never at any time suggested workable alternative routes has successfully opposed something as important in the growth of Metro as was the Don Valley&quot;. Metro Toronto chairman Albert Campbell was incensed at the provincial government, stating, &quot;It may mean that we will never build another expressway.&quot;

==== Ramifications ====
The debate over the Spadina Expressway, and its eventual cancellation, is regarded as a watershed moment in local politics. Toronto City Council was changing at the time to oppose the &quot;top-down&quot; planning of the Metro government. A &quot;Reform Era&quot; in Toronto politics was beginning, which brought to Toronto City Hall David Crombie, John Sewell, Allan Sparrow and Colin Vaughan. This new council viewed the Metro government and its officials with suspicion as not being accountable to local residents. In the 1950s and 1960s, Metro and City Councils had pushed through numerous large projects in transportation, and housing. The impacts on the central neighbourhoods had been substantial and had led to grassroots organizing. Councillors Sewell and Vaughan came directly from the grassroots campaigns.

According to Albert Rose in his study of Metro from 1953 to 1971, the cancellation of the project raised four issues that would affect Metro Council afterwards:

* Who plans? – Until this point, planning had been done by professional planners or Metro department heads based on technical issues, such as projected traffic congestion. Metro had not provided a policy for the planners to follow.
* Role of the OMB in policy – The OMB was in charge of approving capital borrowing, a consideration dating from the days of the Depression. In the case of the Spadina, it had had to decide on an issue far beyond approving whether a municipality could afford the project.
* Role of the OMB in planning – The OMB became an approver of land development disputes, which often pitted municipalities or residents or developers against each other. Was this an appropriate role for the OMB?
* Role of the Metro chairman – The Metro chairman did not appear at the OMB to defend the project. Chairman Campbell took a neutral position on a very important project.

Premier Davis called a provincial election not long after the decision, in October 1971. Davis&#x27; campaign strategy used the Spadina decision to differentiate his government from past Progressive Conservative governments. Davis, who was both attacked and lauded for the Spadina cancellation, was re-elected with increased support in Toronto. Davis would remain in power in Ontario until 1985, when he retired from politics.

In the opinion of critics, the move set &quot;in motion a trend that has yet to abate: politicians overruling the painstaking work of urban and transportation planners&quot;. There is often a long line of vehicles in the southbound lanes from as far north as Lawrence Avenue queued to exit on Eglinton and often long lineups of cars on Eglinton trying to get on Allen Road. The Spadina subway line, designed by the transportation planners within the median of the expressway, has been criticized as the &quot;worst place to put that route... The stations that serve the Allen Road corridor are among the most uninviting, unwalkable places in the city.&quot;

=== 1971–present===
At the time of cancellation in 1971, the expressway was paved to Lawrence Avenue, while the portion running further south to Eglinton Avenue had been graded only and was given the nickname the &quot;Davis ditch&quot;. Traffic from and to the southerly end of the road at Lawrence spilled onto neighbourhood streets, as the activists predicted, especially onto Marlee Avenue. Esther Shiner, who lived near the Lawrence intersection, was elected to North York Council in 1973 on a platform to get the expressway completed to Eglinton Avenue. She headed the &quot;Go Spadina&quot; public campaign that was successful in persuading Metro, against the wishes of the City of Toronto, to pave the ditch and open the road to Eglinton on September8, 1976.

In response, Davis made plans to transfer a strip of land south of Eglinton to the City of Toronto to block any further extension. Metro and the province ended their dispute in an agreement to build the Black Creek Drive arterial road, a southerly extension of Highway 400. Metro would transfer its Spadina lands south of Eglinton to the province, and the province would build Black Creek Drive south to Weston Road. Metro officials dragged their feet by attempting to get the buffer strip moved to Bathurst and St. Clair, enabling a possible future extension to Bathurst, and a widened Bathurst street, but the province threatened to simply expropriate the lands and the lands were turned over to the province in 1984.

On February 7, 1985, on his final day in office, Davis delivered to the City of Toronto a wide strip of the land on the south side of Eglinton Avenue West at the Allen intersection, with a 99-year lease, blocking any possible extension to the south. Opponents such as Shiner had wanted the province to hold onto the land, hoping that a future premier would be willing to consider the highway. Shiner felt that &quot;the expressway will be built, bit by bit, into the city&quot;. Shiner had received a $20million estimate from Metro officials to extend Spadina as a four-lane south to Davenport.

After the land transfer, North York Council made several attempts to get Premier David Peterson to reconsider Davis&#x27;s actions, but he refused to meet Council representatives over the issue. Shiner attempted to get a Metro-wide plebiscite but failed. North York sponsored a telephone survey of Toronto residents to show support for extending the expressway, but a majority supported transit improvements instead. Shiner&#x27;s attempts ended only when she died of cancer in 1987. Metro chairman Dennis Flynn and Metro planners still pushed for the completion as late as 1988, with the release of a traffic study of northwestern Metro that recommended extending the Spadina south, but Metro Council defeated further studies in a 14–12 vote on July 5, 1988. Another proponent, long-time Metro Commissioner of Roads and Traffic Sam Cass, retired that year.

The Spadina subway line was built in the median of the project right-of-way from Wilson to Eglinton. The route south of Eglinton follows the approximate route planned for later sections of the expressway, albeit underground. Construction of the subway had yet to begin when the expressway was cancelled in 1971. Route studies occurred again, the original route was confirmed once more, and the province approved it in January 1973 and construction began; it opened to Wilson station on January 27, 1978.

In 1996, Metro Council voted to end the matter finally and sell the 112 expropriated properties south of Eglinton Avenue. The properties were appraised and sold at fair market value, offered first to their former owners. The proceeds were divided between Metro and Ontario, with Metro keeping two-thirds up to $30million, and proceeds above $30million split equally. One home purchased by Metro in 1967 for $50,000 had appreciated in value to $440,000 by 1997.

During the 2010 Toronto mayoral election, Rocco Rossi proposed completing the expressway in a tunnel to meet the Gardiner Expressway. Later that week, after much criticism of Rossi by other candidates and the media, Rossi revised his position to one of &quot;studying&quot; building a tunnel.

===Chronology===
The road opened in three phases:

* Lawrence Avenue to Yorkdale Mall – Four lanes (future southbound lanes) opened to serve Yorkdale Mall on February 25, 1964.
* Lawrence Avenue West to Wilson Heights Boulevard – December15, 1966
* Lawrence Avenue West to Eglinton Avenue West – September8, 1976
* Wilson Heights Boulevard to Kennard – June 1982

== Future ==
In September 2014, the City of Toronto completed a study of Allen Road and its operation, its effect on nearby neighbourhoods, and the changes made to it since it opened. The city released six options for the terms of reference for an environmental assessment. The options were as follows:

# Maintain the roadway as is.
# Maintain the roadway, make conditions for pedestrians easier, and enhance access to subway stations.
# Make significant improvements to the corridor through the addition of HOV lanes, bike paths and pedestrian infrastructure.
# Transform the roadway to a surface roadway. 
# Transform the roadway to a tunnel or deck.
# Eliminate the roadway entirely and open up the space for other uses. Subway service would remain in place.

<doc id="1137348" wikidata="Q2716967" url="?curid=1137348" title="Gen¹³">
<text>Gen13 is a superhero team and comic book series originally written by Jim Lee and Brandon Choi and illustrated by J. Scott Campbell. It was published by WildStorm under the Image Comics banner, which went on to become an imprint for DC Comics, who continued publishing the &quot;Gen13&quot; title. The comic features a loosely organized team of super-powered beings composed of five teens and their mentor.

==Publication history==
The series takes place in Jim Lee&#x27;s Wildstorm Universe, and &quot;Gen13&quot;″s stories and history intertwine with those from his own works, such as &quot;Wildcats&quot; and &quot;Team 7&quot; (in fact, each of the main characters in &quot;Gen13&quot; is the child of a Team 7 member).

The setup of the series is that a group of teens are invited to take part in a government project, which is in actuality a prison-like testing ground on &quot;gen-active&quot; teens. The teens make their escape, but not before they manifest superhuman powers, and are labelled dangerous fugitives. They rely on each other to fight their foes and unveil the personal secrets that linked them to Team 7 and International Operations.

After a very successful run ending with issue #20, co-creator and illustrator J. Scott Campbell handed the reins of &quot;Gen13&quot; over to other creative teams, saying that leaving freed him up to work on both the &quot;Gen13&quot;/Batman crossover and his own new series (&quot;Danger Girl&quot;).

Following the run of Choi and Campbell were John Arcudi and Gary Frank. Their realistic style, both in writing and art, was a drastic change from the title&#x27;s more fantastic elements. Following their run, Scott Lobdell returned the title to its less-serious, more-sexual roots, but still the title was not received well by fans.

After Lobdell&#x27;s run, Adam Warren was assigned to the title. He had previously proven himself writing two stories using &quot;Gen13&quot; characters (&quot;Grunge: The Movie,&quot; published in &quot;Gen13 Bootleg&quot;, and the standalone mini-series &quot;Magical Drama Queen Roxy&quot;), as well as a two-issue fill-in piece featuring a pop idol who threatened to take over the world with a catchy song. Warren&#x27;s run was well received by fans and critics, but sales did not support the title.

Despite outrageous story arcs and many artist collaborations, the popularity of the book dwindled to the point where Wildstorm decided to blow up the entire team with a six-megaton bomb (&quot;Gen13&quot; vol. 2, #76, June 2002). This served as the catalyst to revamp the series with a new first issue written by Chris Claremont with pencils by Ale Garza. This title featured an all new team mentored by Caitlin Fairchild, and spawned a spin-off series titled &quot;21 Down&quot;. However, this title was cancelled after barely a year. The final issue of the series revealed that the original team was, in fact, still alive, and that the new series had taken place in an alternate dimension which had in some fashion crossed over with the known continuity.

During the height of its popularity, &quot;Gen13&quot; spawned two spin-off books, &quot;DV8&quot; and &quot;Gen13 Bootleg&quot;, as well as a number of specials and mini-series. The team also starred in crossovers with other comic book characters such as Superman, Spider-Man, the Maxx, Monkeyman and O&#x27;Brien, two crossovers with the Marvel Comics teen hero team Generation X, and a crossover with the Fantastic Four. At one point in the early years, Wildstorm and DC were planning a teamup between the team and Batman. However, due to creative differences between creator Brandon Choi and DC, the crossover never happened, although J. Scott Campbell did create artwork showing Fairchild, Grunge, Roxy and Batman in a promotional image.

The title was &quot;rebooted&quot; in October 2006, initially written by Gail Simone with art from Talent Caldwell. At first, the title had no continuity with earlier series. The series was involved in the &quot;&quot; crossover event and then taken over in 2008 with a new creative team, Scott Beatty and Mike Huddleston, as part of &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;.

The new series was canceled along with the rest of the Wildstorm titles published at the time when the line folded. When the Wildstorm universe was subsequently folded into the DC Universe following &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, several of the members of Gen 13 began appearing in other titles. Caitlin Fairchild played a supporting role in &quot;Superboy&quot; and eventually began starring in the spin-off title &quot;The Ravagers&quot;.

==Fictional team history==

===The original Gen13===
International Operations started &quot;government internship&quot; for gifted youths, taking place in an isolated training facility. Following the manifestation of Caitlin Fairchild&#x27;s powers, she fled the complex with Roxy Spaulding, Grunge, Burnout and Threshold in disguise. They were later joined by Sarah Rainmaker. The project was revealed to be a gathering of the gen-active progeny of Team 7.

Threshold tricked the group, sans Fairchild, to return to base to help free the other kids, but upon their return they were apprehended for further testing. With the help of Pitt and John Lynch, the kids finally escaped. The group retreated to La Jolla, California, and officially formed as the group Gen13. They opposed I.O. and their violent counterpart, DV8. (&quot;Gen13&quot; loosely refers to the 13th generation of Americans. Team 7 had been part of a project called Gen12.)

The team spent a lot of time delving into the past of Team 7 to learn more about themselves. Fairchild and Freefall learned they were half-sisters and Lynch was revealed to be Burnout&#x27;s father. Also during this time, Freefall and Grunge began to date, while Rainmaker revealed herself to be bisexual.

The team was caught in an explosion of a six-megaton bomb and believed to be dead. Fairchild was the only survivor and mentored a new Gen13 team, effectively taking Lynch&#x27;s role. However, this team existed in what is later revealed to be an alternate reality which was similar to the mainstream Wildstorm universe except for its point of divergence, the last issue of &quot;Gen13&quot; volume 2. At the end of volume 3, the rest of the original Gen13 team was revealed to be alive and, after time-traveling to avoid the detonation that &quot;killed&quot; them, the reunited group returned to the mainstream Wildstorm universe.

===Wildstorm===
In early 2006, Wildstorm brought all its in-continuity comics since &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; #1 to an end. The universe&#x27;s finale came in the form of the crossover miniseries &quot;Captain Atom: Armageddon&quot;. Following the conclusion of this limited series, the entire Wildstorm line was relaunched with &quot;Worldstorm.&quot; A new &quot;Gen13&quot; series began. The entire world had a &quot;soft reset&quot;; the surroundings were mostly familiar, but there were changes throughout.

In the first arc, the future Gen13 are taken away from their home lives. It is revealed that their parents have been assigned to raise the children to encourage the emergence of specific personality traits. In different areas of the country, Caitlin Fairchild, Roxy Spaulding, Eddie Chang, Bobby Lane and Sarah Rainmaker wake up, each wearing a uniform recognized by their parents. Strike teams immediately attempt to capture the kids; many of their foster parents are terminated.

In the course of the series, it is eventually revealed that (in contrast to the previous iterations) these Gen13s were manipulated and formulated from birth by an unscrupulous biogenetics firm from I.O., called Tabula Rasa. Furthermore, the &quot;souls&quot; of the previous iterations of the Gen13s, previously collected by the Authority&#x27;s Doctor, have settled into these bodies, and when the five of them are together, they cause people to forget their previous history, even those who knew them.

As a result of these new origins, the personalities, histories and abilities of each character have displayed mild-to-massive differences from the previous canon. For instance, Burnout is now a former juvenile hall-resident-turned-reggae-loving pacifist, and John Lynch is a young grunt in I.O.&#x27;s employ. Rainmaker is retconned into being a lesbian rather than bisexual, Fairchild is suspicious and unhappy about her excessive beauty, and Grunge is portrayed as being secretly more intelligent than even Caitlin. Outside of her newfound origins, the character of Freefall remains mostly consistent to previous iterations, save for a slightly greater level of confidence and self-reliance.

===World&#x27;s End===

The series resumes following &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; as part of the &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot; storyline, with the group coming out of a teleportation system in which they had been held (due to power loss) into a devastated New York approximately six months following the events of &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;.

Once they reach the surface from the underground lair, the group is shocked to see what has happened in New York (aside from Burnout, who is blind at this point). While Grunge is quick to claim that an asteroid, global warming, and other natural disasters were responsible for the destruction, Rainmaker blames terrorists. After a confrontation with several crazed metahuman-hunters, the group finally manages to escape New York.

Once outside of New York, the group finds themselves trapped in a mall with several mutated monsters, one of which seemingly infects Fairchild. While the group is holding together, tensions have begun to rise between Fairchild and Rainmaker, with the latter being attracted to the first. Burnout, while still blind, gains some semblance of vision with the ability to sense heat patterns.

During their stay at a skater park run by teens, Grunge is crowned king. He is originally thrilled about it but later finds out that his predecessor is to be eaten in a soup. Rainmaker, having witnessed Caitlin and Bobby kiss in a tent, grabs her gear and leaves the group without saying goodbye to anyone.

The other teens are confronted by the cloned scientist Dr. Cross, who created them after their original deaths; however, he and his assistant Megan are both stuck at ages five and nine, respectively, due to the loss of electricity caused by the cataclysm, while retaining their memories and intellects. They manage to save Grunge and to overpower the heavily armed children-scientists due to the intervention of Goo, a Gen14. As they flee, it is revealed that Caitlin&#x27;s power has failed, most probably due to the infection, and she suffers a serious knife injury.

Having nowhere else to go, they join the children-scientists, who promise to heal Caitlin. They arrive in a small town that is under the &quot;protection&quot; of a World War II supervillain team, the Fearsmiths (the imprisoned villains from &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;). The two groups clash, with Gen13 being easily beaten. Following another defeat, they are separated from Fairchild and the scientists as they are abducted by the Paladins, who offer to train them.

Unknown to any them, Goo was sent by the remnants of the U.S. military—specifically a branch who specialized in fighting metahumans. The squad was designed to apprehend Gen13 and have accordingly been practicing on a small group of Gen14s, of which Goo is a member. Naturally, their practice sessions ended with the Gen14s being killed, cloned, and their minds transferred and later modified so that they do not remember their ordeal. Oddly enough, Goo seems to be regaining some of her memories.

Currently on orders from the general in charge of the military squad, Gen14 has invaded the Paladins&#x27; headquarters and are ready to confront Gen13, which currently consists only of Burnout, Grunge and Freefall.

The fight between the gen-actives and the military branch is over quickly with the Gen14 and military winning. Once they have been captured, Gen13 are offered an ultimatum: either join the military and serve them or be executed. In order to prove his point, the general shoots and kills Gen14&#x27;s Windsprint. His plans, however, are crossed by Roxy, who levitates the Paladin base into space, knocking them all out due to oxygen deprivation.

In the meantime, Caitlin has fully mutated due to the Warhol virus to which she was exposed and is rampaging across town in a Hulk-like fashion. Her rampage is cut short as the Paladin base crash-lands next to her. The gen-actives band together and take on Caitlin, hoping to calm her down, but they do not succeed. Seeing no alternative, Goo sacrifices herself in order to short-circuit the virus, thus reverting Caitlin to her former self.

Three weeks later, Bobby, Roxy, Grunge, Caitlin and the surviving Gen14s Runt and Ditto arrive at Tranquility (a town of retired super-heroes), only to find a crater where the town had been. The group decides not to despair and to go on even if it means that are heading into trouble.

===The New 52===
Following the New 52 continuity reboot, Gen13 briefly debuts in the epilogue of &quot;Supergirl&quot; issue #33; membership consists of the original lineup.

==Characters==
The original lineup of Gen13 was:
* Caitlin Fairchild: Once an ordinary girl, Caitlin&#x27;s muscles spontaneously increased in density, granting her superhuman strength, agility, speed and endurance. The manifestation of her &quot;Gen-active&quot; status caused her body mass and size to increase from a petite young woman into that of a statuesque Amazon, shredding her clothing at the time. Fairchild is by far the most intelligent of the group. She is also Freefall&#x27;s half-sister. Often, she is portrayed as being either naively unaware of or mildly uncomfortable with her newly curvaceous figure.
* Bobby &quot;Burnout&quot; Lane: Son of John Lynch (Gen13&#x27;s mentor), Bobby manifested the ability to generate and manipulate high-energy coherent plasma, which ignites on exposure to oxygen. He later developed the ability to fly as well as certain psionic abilities.
* Roxanne &quot;Freefall&quot; Spaulding: &quot;Roxy&quot; is the youngest gen-active teen, with the ability to control the effects of gravity on herself and on others. She can nullify gravity (and float) or multiply it (making objects ultraheavy). It is also suggested by some other characters that if she thought about it and used her powers to their fullest advantage, she could manipulate spacetime as this is related to gravity. She has a crush on Grunge and is jealous of Fairchild&#x27;s physique. Keeps Queelocke as a &quot;pet.&quot; It was later revealed that Spaulding and Fairchild were half-sisters, both the daughters of Alex Fairchild from Team 7.
* Sarah Rainmaker: Rainmaker can influence local weather systems, manipulating air currents to grant herself flight and direct water with a gesture. Amplifier bands on her wrists augment her ability to project lightning. Rainmaker is Apache and is Stephen Callahan&#x27;s daughter and Threshold and Bliss&#x27; half-sister. Among the main characters, she is the most concerned with social and political issues. The rest of the team is still adjusting to her sexual orientation (she is attracted to women).
* Percival Edmund &quot;Grunge&quot; Chang: Able to mimic the molecular structure of any material he touches (and partially bestow this effect on others), Grunge is a surf rat who enjoys sleeping late. He possesses brown belts in five martial arts styles and has few if any redeeming characteristics—though he does possess a photographic memory that allowed him to take the same classes as Fairchild does (much to her surprise) during the period that the team went to college. His father is Team 7 member Phillip Chang.
* John Lynch: The team&#x27;s mentor and father of Robert &quot;Burnout&quot; Lane. Lynch was the leader of Team 7 and close friend of the children&#x27;s parents. His eye has been replaced after he gouged it out as a result of a mental attack. Like all surviving members of Team 7, Lynch was granted powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities that are highly unstable and dangerous. Because of this, he avoids using his powers if at all possible.
* Anna: a heavily armed covert-assassination gynoid programmed to serve Gen13 as a maid and to love them as her own children.

The team recently added newcomers:
* Holly &quot;Breakdown&quot; Denton: Occasionally known as Goo, Holly has the ability to disassemble molecules, seemingly causing objects to melt into goo. She was formerly a member of Gen14. As of &quot;Gen13&quot; vol. 4, #32, Holly has sacrificed her life to save Caitlin and was once more seen as an incubating clone.
* Amber &quot;Ditto&quot; LeRoux: Not much is known about Amber, only that Holly refers to her as a typical airhead. A former Gen14. Her power is infinite multiplicity which allows her to make an unlimited number of copies of herself.
* Guillermo &quot;Runt&quot; Sandoval: Not much is known about Guillermo. A former Gen14. His powers allow him to grow and shrink.
* Lance &quot;Hardbody&quot; Wieder: The second-in-command of the former Gen14. Not much is known about him at this point; during a fight between him and Gen13, his face was scarred by Holly, who was defending herself. He and Windsprint were left behind in order to recover. His powers include augmented strength/stamina and increased dermal density which makes him super-strong and near-invulnerable. Doctor Cross (the maker of the current Gen program) expressed interest in potential offspring between him and Caitlin Fairchild.
* Shaqira &quot;Windsprint&quot; Johnson: The speedster of Gen14. She was shot in the head by a crazed general and believed to be dead. However, it is revealed that her enhanced physiology also included a heightened metabolism allowing her to survive the gunshot. She and Hardbody had been originally left behind in order to recuperate.

==Collected editions==
There have been a number of trade paperbacks collecting the Gen13 comic books, spin-off series, limited series and specials.

==In other media==

===Animation===

Kevin Altieri (&quot;&quot;) directed a &quot;Gen13&quot; animated feature for Buena Vista Pictures. It was shelved by the studio soon after Wildstorm was bought by DC Comics and never released in the U.S., but it has seen a limited video release in Europe and Australia in 2000. Grunge was voiced by Flea, Lynch was voiced by John de Lancie, and Threshold was voiced by Mark Hamill.

===Novels===
Three &quot;Gen13&quot; paperback novels were released:
*&quot;Time and Chance&quot;, by Jeff Mariotte and Scott Ciencin, features a criminal mastermind who enjoys gambling. He captures the formula for creating superpowered beings and plans to use it to increase his power.
*&quot;Netherwar&quot;, written by Jeff Mariotte and Christopher Golden, begins with an old ally of Lynch meeting with the group. International Operations has apparently made contact with the realm of Hell itself underneath a casino it secretly owns. Gen13 must infiltrate the already-affected building and close down the portal before all of humanity is doomed.
*&quot;Version_2.0&quot;, written by Sholly Fisch, focuses on the diabolic plan of the team&#x27;s old International Operations nemesis Ivana Baiul, who has fallen from the good graces of the government.

===Video games===
In February 1996, it was announced Electronic Arts had signed a deal with WildStorm to develop a series of action-adventure games based on &quot;Gen13&quot;.

<text>The Support Force Glacier () is a major glacier in the Pensacola Mountains, draining northward between the Forrestal Range and Argentina Range to the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf.

==Mapping and name==
The Support Force Glacier was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photographs in 1956–66. It was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for the United States Naval Support Force Antarctica, which provided logistical support for the United States Antarctic Program during this period.

==Location==

The Support Force Glacier flows in a north-northeast direction past the Forrestal Range to its west. It is fed by the Chambers Glacier from the west, which separates the Saratoga Table from the Lexington Table in the Forrestal Range. Further north it passes the Argentina Range to the east. The San Martín Glacier enters from the east, flowing between the Schneider Hills and the Panzarini Hills in this range.
==Tributaries and features==
===Chambers Glacier===

A glacier in the Forrestal Range, draining east from Mount Lechner and Kent Gap, at the juncture of the Saratoga and Lexington Tables, to enter Support Force Glacier. It was discovered and photographed on January 13, 1956 on a transcontinental patrol plane flight of United States Navy Operation Deep Freeze I from McMurdo Sound to the vicinity of Weddell Sea and return. It was named by the US-ACAN after Captain Washington I. Chambers, United States Navy, one of the pioneers in the development of the airplane catapult for ships.

===Thompo Icefall===

An icefall at the northeast edge of Saratoga Table between Mount Hummer and Mount Hook, in the Forrestal Range. It was mapped by USGS in 1967 from ground surveys and United States Navy aerial photographs taken in 1964. It was named by US-ACAN in 1979 after Robert W. Thompson, photographer of United States Navy Squadron VX-6 in the Balleny Islands and Sky-Hi Nunataks areas, 1963-64, and in the Pensacola Mountains, 1964-65. &quot;Thompo&quot; is a nickname by which he and other family members have been known.

===Kovacs Glacier===

Glacier on the southeast side of Lexington Table, flowing east-northeast into Support Force Glacier in the Forrestal Range. It was named by US-ACAN in 1979 after Austin Kovacs, leader of the 1973-74 USARP-CRREL survey party (with G. Erlanger and G. Abele) in this area; also worked in the McMurdo Sound area.

===San Martín Glacier===

A broad glacier flowing westward and bisecting the Argentina Range. It was mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1956-67. It was named by US-ACAN for the Argentine icebreaker &quot;General San Martín&quot;, which brought the first party to General Belgrano Station on the Filchner Ice Shelf in 1954-55 and made numerous relief and resupply voyages to the area.

<text>Lee Na-young (born February 22, 1979) is a South Korean actress. She is best known for her leading roles in television series such as &quot;Ruler of Your Own World&quot; (2002), &quot;Ireland&quot; (2004) and &quot;Romance Is a Bonus Book&quot; (2019), as well as the films &quot;Someone Special&quot; (2004) and &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; (2006). Aside from acting, Lee is also known for appearing in numerous commercials.

== Career ==
Lee Na-young began her modeling career in a Jambangee Jeans TV commercial in 1998, then made her acting debut that same year. Following supporting roles in 1999 television dramas &quot;Did We Really Love?&quot;, &quot;KAIST&quot;, and &quot;Queen&quot;, Lee starred in the tepidly received 2001 Hong Kong sci-fi action film &quot;Dream of A Warrior&quot; starring Leon Lai. She also appeared in the 2001 music video for &quot;Catherine&#x27;s Wheel&quot; by Britpop band Rialto.

But Lee rose to fame in 2002 with the critically acclaimed series &quot;Ruler of Your Own World&quot;. She played an indie rock musician who unexpectedly falls for a terminally ill grifter, and Lee and her fellow cast members were praised for their realistic, nuanced acting. She later reunited with &quot;Ruler of Your Own World&quot; screenwriter In Jung-ok for &quot;Ireland&quot;, a 2004 drama about a Korean adoptee who journeys to her homeland, but its reception was less positive.

During this time, Lee had become one of the top-ranked and highest-paid commercial models, endorsing diverse products such as cosmetics (notably Laneige and Lancôme), electronics, clothing lines, beverages, food, telecommunications, and construction companies. She is considered to have one of the most beautiful and idealized faces in Korea. Lee later became the first Korean to appear on the cover of fashion magazine &quot;W Korea&quot;, for its November 2009 issue.

But unlike her graceful and glamorous public persona in advertisements, her image in film has been the opposite, with Lee choosing to portray women who are awkward and eccentric. In 2002, she starred in the cyber romance &quot;Who R. U.?&quot; as an introverted character similar to her role in &quot;Ruler of Your Own World&quot;. Lee then played a quirky, English-challenged civil servant in Kim Sung-su&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Please Teach Me English&quot; (2003) and the harmless stalker of a struggling baseball player in Jang Jin&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Someone Special&quot; (2004).
She won several Best Actress prizes for &quot;Someone Special&quot;, notably from the prestigious Blue Dragon Film Awards.

Lee again drew praise in 2006, this time for her dramatic chops in &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot;, Song Hae-sung&#x27;s film adaptation of Gong Ji-young&#x27;s novel &quot;Our Happy Time&quot; about a suicidal rape victim who develops a close bond with a death row inmate. She next played an emotionally tormented sleepwalker in Kim Ki-duk&#x27;s &quot;Dream&quot; (2008), and nearly died while filming a scene where her character hangs herself.

In 2010, Lee headlined &quot;Lady Daddy&quot;, playing a trans woman photographer whose life is disrupted with the sudden arrival of a young boy who claims that she&#x27;s his biological father. To promote the film, she made a guest appearance in the sitcom &quot;High Kick Through the Roof&quot;. Lee then returned to television with the big-budget action-mystery series &quot;The Fugitive: Plan B&quot;, in which she performed her own action scenes without a stunt double.

When Lee&#x27;s contract with talent agency KeyEast expired in 2011 (she had signed with KeyEast in 2006, and with the William Morris Agency in 2009), she joined Eden 9 Entertainment. In 2012, she starred in Yoo Ha&#x27;s suspense thriller &quot;Howling&quot;, about a veteran detective (played by Song Kang-ho) who teams up with a female rookie (Lee) to solve a series of murders involving a mysterious wolfdog.

In 2013, Lee appeared in a minor role in the two-part Japanese film &quot;&quot;. She then played an actress having a secret romance with a boom operator in &quot;Sad Scene&quot;; it was among the three short films in the omnibus &quot;Woman, Man&quot; commissioned by &quot;W Korea&quot; for its 10th anniversary in 2015.

In 2018, Lee returned to the silver screen with the North Korean refugee drama &quot;Beautiful Days&quot;, which premiered at the 23rd Busan International Film Festival.

In 2019, Lee returned to the small screen after nine years by starring in the romance comedy drama &quot;Romance Is a Bonus Book&quot; alongside Lee Jong-suk. She played a main character named Kang Dan-yi who is a new temporary worker of book publishing company.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and children ===
Lee married actor Won Bin on May 30, 2015, in a small, private ceremony in a wheat field near an inn in Won&#x27;s hometown, Jeongseon County, Gangwon Province, South Korea. The couple belong to the same talent agency Eden 9, and reportedly began dating in August 2012 (though Eden 9 only confirmed the relationship in July 2013). A press release from Eden 9 on December 19, 2015, announced that Lee had given birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a son.

<text>David Ouimet (born 1965) is an American artist, author, and musician. He was a band member of Cop Shoot Cop, Motherhead Bug, Firewater, and Sulfur but has since moved on to interests other than music.

He grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, in a music oriented household. Having been introduced to synthesizers in his teenage years, he developed an interest in editing. He studied film at Rhode Island School of Design where he developed a friendship with his future bandmate Tod Ashley.

In the early 1990s, Ouimet co-founded the noise rock group Cop Shoot Cop, playing sampler and keyboards. He left after their first album to form the legendary Gypsy Klezmer Punk outfit Motherhead Bug, as songwriter, vocalist and trombonist. He has also recorded and toured with Foetus and Swans.

Ouimet&#x27;s illustrations of creepy, bipedal, fez-capped insect creatures (usually wielding scimitars or smoking hookahs) appeared on Motherhead Bug&#x27;s singles and album, and he has continued his career as an illustrator with Robert D. San Souci&#x27;s &quot;Dare to be Scared&quot; series and Nancy Etchmendy&#x27;s &quot;Cat in Glass and other Tales of the Unnatural&quot;.

&quot;Daydreams for Night&quot;, stories by the Canadian musician John Southworth and illustrated by David Ouimet, was published by Simply Read books in 2015. School Library Journal described the book as &quot;gorgeously illustrated&quot; and Publishers Weekly noted &quot;Ouimet&#x27;s haunting b&amp;w illustrations follows in the tradition of Shaun Tan&#x27;s Tales of Suburbia and Chris Van Allsburg&#x27;s Mysteries of Harris Burdock.&quot; Ouimet created an animated trailer for the book.

In 2015 Ouimet began modeling and has appeared in magazines, billboards, and major international print advertising campaigns.

A Japanese edition of &quot;Daydreams for Night&quot; was published by Asuka Shinsha Japan in January 2016.

Ouimet&#x27;s work was selected for the Society of Illustrators Annual 59 and was exhibited at the Museum of American Illustration in New York City in February 2017.

His street art began appearing in New York City in 2016 and has since appeared throughout the world. Ouimet&#x27;s primary imagery revolves around his Hoodiebird characters, cloaked birds generally embellished with ornate filagree.

In September 2019 Ouimet&#x27;s debut book as an author and illustrator, &quot;I Go Quiet&quot;, was published in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India by Canongate Books. In early 2020 the book was published in the U.S. by W.W. Norton, and in a Portuguese edition by Companhia das Letras, A Turkish Edition by Cinar, a German edition by MVG Verlag, an Italian edition by Terre di Mezzo Editore, a Spanish edition by Minotauro, and a Chinese Edition by the CITIC Press Group, among others.

&quot;I Get Loud&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;I Go Quiet&quot; was published by Canongate books in the summer of 2021, with numerous translated editions.

&quot;I Go Quiet&quot; was the winner of the 2020 East Sussex Children&#x27;s Book Award, and was a finalist for the 2021 Kate Greenaway Medal.

In March 2022 “ Eu Fico Em Silencio “, the Brazilian edition of “ I Go Quiet “ was selected for the UNESCO 2021 Books of Distinction.

In March of 2022 David directed his debut animated music video, “ Glide “ from Earth Moon Earth featuring Skye Edwards of the British Band Morcheeba.

In the summer of 2023 David relocated to Europe, where he is working on his next children’s book.

<text>Cliffside is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located along the Scarborough Bluffs in the district of Scarborough. Its boundaries are Kennedy Road to the west (where Kingston and Danforth Road merge), St. Clair Avenue East to the north, Brimley Road to the east, and the Bluffs on the lakeshore to the south.

==History==

Cliffside was developed as a modern large scale suburban housing subdivision in the early 1950s, during the post–World War II period with the baby boom, subdividing of farmland. The area south of Kingston Road was previously a golf course. Some homes were built prior to this period with the development of Birch Cliff to the west.

The population consists of a large number of those with ancestral backgrounds from the British Isles: English 19.8% Scottish 14.4% Irish 11.8%, totalling 46% (source: 2001 Census).

==Education==

Two public school boards operate elementary schools in Cliffside, the secular Toronto District School Board, and the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board. Neither school board operates a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with students attending TCDSB or TDSB secondary schools in adjacent neighbourhoods.

The French first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Cliffside, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood.

In addition to primary and secondary institutions, Cliffside is also home to an independent post-secondary Catholic seminary, St. Augustine&#x27;s Seminary.

==Recreation==
Cliffside is home to a number of parks, most of which are near the waterfront and the Scarborough Bluffs including Scarborough Crescent Park, Scarborough Heights Park, Midland Ravine Park, and the eastern portion of Bluffer&#x27;s Park. Bluffers Park hosts a number of amenities including the Bluffer&#x27;s Park Yacht Club.

Municipal parks in Cliffside are operated by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division.

==Transportation==
Public transportation is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s (TTC) bus system, with several routes operating through the neighbourhood. In addition to TTC bus routes, access to GO Transit commuter rail lines, Lakeshore East and Stouffville may be accessed from Scarborough GO station.

Major east–west roads in Cliffside include St. Clair Avenue, and Kingston Road.

<doc id="1137361" wikidata="Q4636038" url="?curid=1137361" title="38th Parallel (band)">
<text>38th Parallel was a Christian rock band formed in Ames, Iowa. Before being signed they received extensive airplay in Iowa markets alongside other CCM Artists. Unknown to them, they were entered into a talent search contest for Christian music giant Word Records created by former A&amp;R Alvin V. Williams. Alvin Williams signed the group to Word Records, but they soon signed and released their first project on, Squint Entertainment.

Their name is a play on the 38th parallel north, which divides North Korea from South Korea. Their first album, &quot;Turn the Tides&quot;, was released in 2002, following the band&#x27;s nationwide tour with artists Skillet and The Benjamin Gate. The album received a Dove Award nomination in 2003 for Rock Album of the Year.

Following the disbandment of 38th Parallel, vocalist Mark Jennings, guitarist Jason Munday, and drummer Aaron Nordyke formed the Harry Potter-themed electronica band Ministry of Magic.

In 2005, 38th Parallel made available the demo tracks for their second album that were never finished or released.

On August 2, 2006, band member Mark Jennings announced, via the band&#x27;s MySpace blog, that it is unlikely that 38th Parallel will release another album. The decision was influenced by shifting priorities in the personal lives of the members such as marriage.

On June 16, 2007, 4 out of the 5 members of 38th Parallel played 5 songs at Bash on the Farm in Garner, IA.

Currently, Mark Jennings, Jason Munday, and Aaron Nordyke are all still involved with the wizard rock band called Ministry of Magic, along with Luke Conard, Ryan Seiler, and Jeremy Jennings. They currently have four albums (&quot;The Tri Wizard&quot; LP, &quot;Goodbye Privet Drive&quot;, &quot;Onward and Upward&quot;, &quot;Magic is Might&quot;, and &quot;Songs from Gringott&#x27;s Vault&quot;) and perform when possible.

<doc id="1137362" wikidata="Q5292339" url="?curid=1137362" title="Don Burke">
<text>Donald William Burke (born 16 July 1947) is an Australian television presenter, television producer, author and horticulturist. He is best known as the longtime host of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Backyard&quot;, a lifestyle program produced by his wife&#x27;s company CTC Productions, which ran for 17 years from 1987 to late 2004 on the Nine Network. He was also responsible for the creation of garden makeover program &quot;Backyard Blitz&quot;, starring former colleague Jamie Durie.

==Career==
In 2004, &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot; listed Burke among its top 50 entertainers list, saying he earned an estimated A$7.2 million in 2004.

Burke is a professional horticulturist and former board member of Landcare Australia and has been active in a number of other public roles. Burke spent 20 years working on his own home and garden. He has been an outspoken critic of numerous environmental advocacy groups. From July 2005 to late 2008, Burke was the Chair of the climate-change-denying Australian Environment Foundation. 

Burke was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) on 26 January 2010 for service to conservation and the environment through advisory roles, to the horticultural industry, and to the media as a television presenter.

Burke appeared on &quot;A Current Affair&quot; in July 2015, with his wife Marea, discussing her health battles including arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and breast cancer.

==Sexual misconduct allegations==
An investigation started when journalist Tracey Spicer announced on Twitter that she was investigating the sexual harassment by powerful men in the Australian entertainment industry. Spicer said, &quot;One name kept recurring – Don Burke&quot;.
On 26 November 2017, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; published a joint investigative piece containing claims that Burke had sexually harassed, sexually assaulted, and bullied women throughout his television career. The report quotes alleged female victims, as well as both female and male witnesses, including David Leckiethe former head of the Nine Network, on which Burke&#x27;s programs airedcomparing Burke to American producer Harvey Weinstein. Kate McClymont, Lorna Knowles, Tracey Spicer and Alison Branley received a Walkley Award for their investigation.

Other former Channel Nine executives went &quot;on the record&quot; to comment on the allegations.

Sam Chisholm said, &quot;Don Burke was a disgrace because of his behaviour internally and externally. This precluded him from ever becoming a major star.&quot;

Peter Meakin said, &quot;There was gossip about inappropriate language and he was incredibly demanding. If someone fell short of the mark, he would excoriate them. He was unforgiving.&quot;

In response to the allegations, Burke released a lengthy statement which said he was &quot;deeply hurt and outraged at the false and defamatory claims&quot; and suggested the &quot;baseless&quot; claims were from former employees who &quot;bear grudges against me&quot;. Burke also stated that he has had a &quot;life-long opposition to sexism and misogyny&quot;.

Burke claimed to have self-diagnosed Asperger&#x27;s syndrome and, in a media interview following revelations about his alleged misconduct, said that these &quot;genetic failings&quot; were to blame for some of his conduct. In response, Autism Awareness Australia stated that Burke&#x27;s claim was &quot;beyond appalling&quot; and &quot;gobsmacking&quot;.

In the following days, many celebrities came forward to recount their observations of Burke&#x27;s sexist and offensive behaviour, including Susie O&#x27;Neill, Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Di Morrissey, Debra Byrne, Tottie Goldsmith, Amity Dry and Mike Carlton.

Following the interview on &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, one of the women sued Burke for defamation on the grounds that he said she had lied about the sexual harassment allegation and that she made the false allegation as part of a &quot;witch hunt&quot; during the interview. She lost the case on the grounds that Justice David Mossop did not find Burke&#x27;s denial in the interview was credible, so viewers would not conclude that she was a liar or part of a witch hunt, and thus was not defamed.

<text>Guildwood, also known as Guildwood Village, is a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the eastern area of the city, in the district of Scarborough. It is bounded by the Scarborough Bluffs, south of Kingston Road, from Grey Abbey Trail in the east.

==History==
Its oldest building is the 18th century Osterhout Log Cabin situated along the bluffs. The log cabin is one of Toronto&#x27;s oldest buildings still standing, although its exact date of construction is unknown.

In 1914, the Guild Inn was opened. Initially a private residence, it later became an art colony, and a hotel. From 1941 to 1947, the inn was leased by the Government of Canada as a base for the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service, HMCS &quot;Bytown II&quot;, and later a military hospital.

After Metropolitan Toronto was formed in 1954, taxes on the Guild Inn property increased to the point that the owners Rosa and Spencer Clark decided to sell of their property, which became the basis for the Guildwood Village subdivision. The Clarks remained involved with the development of the subdivision, in its design and layout to preserve as many trees in the area as possible. Development started in 1957 with the famous &quot;Avenue of Homes&quot; display of upscale homes. The community introduced a number of new ideas in subdivision design, including winding roads and cul-de-sacs to reduce through traffic, and underground power and phone lines. &quot;Rear-lot parks were modelled after English footpaths as walkways within the community.&quot;

The Clarks helped design the entrance gates to the subdivision. After most of Toronto&#x27;s Stanley Barracks (New Fort York) was demolished in 1953, its gates were salvaged and re-erected at the entrance to Guildwood Village. These gates, now called the &quot;Guildwood Gates&quot; still provide a unique and grand entrance to the community at the corner of Kingston Road and Guildwood Parkway.

Guild Park is famous for its historical architectural fragments from the façades of demolished buildings in Downtown Toronto. Just west of the Guild Inn is Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute.

== Guildwood Village Flag==

The Guildwood Village Flag was designed by Marsha Leverock Westergaard and was adopted by the Guildwood Village Community Association (GVCA) on June 12, 2018. The Guildwood Village flag can be seen flying in Guildwood Village from cars, store windows and residential flag poles.

The flag has deep meaning in its symbols and colours. The four quadrants read Guild – Wood – Village – on the Bluffs and represent Guildwood Village’s rich history of arts and culture, the abundant woods and green spaces, unique mid-century architecture, the Scarborough bluffs and a strong, vibrant Guildwood Village community.

==Education==

The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a secular public school board that operates several schools in the neighbourhood, including one secondary school, Sir Wilfrid Laurier Collegiate Institute. In addition to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, TDSB also operates several elementary schools in Guildwood. They include:

* Guildwood Junior Public School
* Elizabeth Simcoe Junior Public School
* Jack Miner Senior Public School
* Poplar Road Junior Public School

Other public school boards that provides schooling for students in Guildwood include the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). CSV is a French-based secular public school board, whereas CSCM and TCDSB are separate public school boards, the former being French-based.

==Recreation==

Guildwood is home to several municipal parks, all of which are managed by Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. Many of these parks are situated near the Scarborough Bluffs and the Toronto waterfront.

Parks in Guildwood include Elizabeth Simcoe Park, Grey Abbey Park, Guild Park and Gardens, South Marine Park, and Sylvan Park. Guild Park and Gardens is notable for its collection of relics, collected from the remains of demolished buildings primarily from Downtown Toronto.

==Transportation==
Public transportation in Guildwood is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC operates several bus routes through the neighbourhood.

In addition to TTC routes, GO Transit&#x27;s commuter rail service may be accessed from Guildwood GO Station. In addition to being a station for the GO Transit Lakeshore East line, the station is also used by Via Rail, an intercity train service.

===Street===

Guildwood Parkway is the main roadway in Guildwood. The eastern end of the roadway splits north, and east, with the northern portion forming Morningside Avenue. Many of the streets in the Guildwood development were named by Rosa and Spencer Clark.

* Bethune - after Dr. Norman Bethune
* Bledlow - after the England home of Spencer Clark&#x27;s grandmother

<text>Kenepuru Sound is one of the larger of the Marlborough Sounds in the South Island of New Zealand. The drowned valley is an arm of Pelorus Sound / Te Hoiere, it runs for from the northeast to southwest, joining Pelorus Sound a quarter of the way down the latter&#x27;s path to the Cook Strait.

Queen Charlotte Sound, the largest sound in Marlborough, lies to the southeast, parallel to Kenepuru Sound. Some of the small side arms of the two sounds are only hundreds of metres apart, at Te Mahia Bay and Portage Bay, but are separated by a steep serrated range of hills. Not surprisingly, one of the settlements on this stretch of coast is called Portage, named for the simplest method of passing between the two sounds. Queen Charlotte Track runs along the ridge of hills between Kenepuru Sound and Queen Charlotte Sound.

Early road development linking Picton with Kenepuru contributed to Kenepuru Sound being used as a holiday destination. Resorts and holiday houses are dotted along the coast and at Te Mahia Bay and Portage Bay. A sealed, but windy, narrow road leads along the southern shore of Kenepuru Sound all the way to Kenepuru Head. From there, unsealed roads continue further and along the less populated northern shore.

<text>Juan Eugenio Serrallés Colón (1836–1921) was the founder of Hacienda Mercedita in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and what was to become Destileria Serralles, producers of &quot;Don Q&quot;, a brand of Puerto Rican rum.

==Family and early years==
Juan Serrallés Colón, born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, was the son of Sebastian Serrallés, a wealthy Spaniard from Catalonia who settled in Ponce in the early 19th century and went into the sugarcane business, and Juana Colon. Serrallés Colón was the owner of &quot;Hacienda Mercedita&quot; as well as the neighboring Hacienda Fe and Hacienda Laurel.

Juan Serrallés was raised in Ponce and educated in Spain. When Juan Serrallés returned to the island, he returned to lead the work in his hacienda (plantation).

==&quot;Don Q&quot; rum==
In 1865, Juan imported a still which he purchased in France and produced his first few casks of rum. He named the rum &quot;Don Q&quot; in honor of the legendary Spanish fictional character Don Quixote. Soon after, the &quot;Don Q&quot; brand of rum became very popular in Puerto Rico and the family business began to grow.

In 1903 the Serrallés family, under the leadership of Juan Serrallés, installed the first continuous still in Puerto Rico. Juan Serrallés died in 1921 just as the production of rum was being halted because of the United States Prohibition Act of the 1920s. Juan&#x27;s family continued to run the sugar side of the business but for the distillery side started to produce medical alcohol instead of the outlawed rum. It was called &quot;Alcoholado Superior 70&quot;.

==Personal life==
Juan Serrallés Colón married Mercedes Perez (1845–1922), after whom he named his sugar plantation. They had three sons and two daughters. His eldest son, Juan Eugenio Serrallés, became the head of the Serrallés family business after Juan died in 1921. Juan&#x27;s grandchildren – via Juan Eugenio&#x27;s marriage to Rosa Maria Sanchez – were Rosa, Juan Eugenio, and Felix Juan.

Juan Eugenio built a huge castle in Ponce, called the Serralles Castle, for his three children some ten years after his father&#x27;s death, a testament to the prosperity of the plantation business that Juan Serrallés had started the previous century. Eventually one of these grandchildren, Felix Juan, became the next in line to run the sugar plantation and rum distillery businesses, which he did until his death in 1985.

==Currently==
The sugarcane business ceased to operate in 1994, with only the rum distillery that Juan had spearheaded decades before still operating. Today, Juan Serrallés Colón&#x27;s great-grandson, Felix Juan Serrallés, Jr., presides over Destileria Serralles, Inc.

==Legacy==
The Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has honored the memory of Juan Serrallés Colon by naming both a grade school and a high school in Ponce after him. There is also an elementary school named after his wife Mercedes.

<doc id="1137374" wikidata="Q45544" url="?curid=1137374" title="Summer Scent">
<text>Summer Scent () is a 2003 South Korean television series starring Song Seung-heon, Son Ye-jin, Ryu Jin, and Han Ji-hye. It is the third installment of season-themed tetralogy &quot;Endless Love&quot; drama series directed by Yoon Seok-ho. It aired on KBS2 from July 7 to September 9, 2003, on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 (KST) for 20 episodes.

The series had an average viewership rating of 10.7% and reached a peak viewership of 11.6%.

==Plot==
Yoo Min-woo&#x27;s (Song Seung-heon) first love was Seo Eun-hye (Shin Ae). However, Eun-hye gets into a car accident and dies. Without Min-woo&#x27;s knowledge, her parents decide to donate her organs. Shim Hye-won (Son Ye-jin) has suffered from a possibly fatal heart disease ever since childhood. Miraculously, she finds that she will be obtaining a heart from a donor, the deceased Eun-hye.

Suffering from the pain of losing his girlfriend, Min-woo goes to Italy to study, with the memories of Eun-hye still lingering in his heart. When he returns to Korea, fate takes a turn and brings Hye-won and Min-woo together. When the two first meet at the airport, Hye-won&#x27;s heart (Eun-hye&#x27;s heart) oddly beats faster when she is around Min-woo.

Park Jung-jae (Ryu Jin) is Hye-won&#x27;s fiancé. Jung-jae&#x27;s younger sister, Park Jung-ah (Han Ji-hye) meets Min-woo in Italy and falls for him. Meanwhile, Min-woo feels guilt towards Eun-hye, because his feelings of love are stirred once again as he keeps being around Hye-won.

Coincidentally, Min-woo ends up being hired as the art director for Jung-jae&#x27;s project &quot;Summer Scent,&quot; with Hye-won as their florist. Hiding their prior encounter in the forest, they awkwardly greet each other as if they&#x27;d never met. During the project, their fondness deepens, and Min-woo begins to &quot;recognize&quot; similarities between Eun-hye and Hye-won. Hye-won, on the other hand, believes it to be fate that her heart beats faster whenever Min-woo is near. Their fondness for each other soon triggers Jung-ah&#x27;s and shortly thereafter, Jung-jae&#x27;s suspicions. Jung-jae, however, chooses to turn a blind eye as he deeply loves Hye-won. It is then Hye-won&#x27;s turn to be confused as to whether her feelings for Min-woo are true, or a physiological result of Eun-hye&#x27;s past feelings for him. As a result, she decides to leave Min-woo, trying to cover up her feelings of guilt towards Jung-jae and Jung-ah. She returns to Jung-jae&#x27;s side and agrees to marry him.

To forget Hye-won, Min-woo decides to leave for Italy indefinitely, but only after seeing her one last time. At Hye-won&#x27;s wedding, Min-woo casts one last glance at her and then leaves. With Min-woo near, Hye-won&#x27;s heart once more signals his presence, and thus alerted, she sees Min-woo leaving. Desperately trying to catch Min-woo, Hye-won collapses. Min-woo rushes Hye-won to the hospital with Jung-jae arriving a little later. Jung-jae, angry at Min-woo for having caused Hye-won&#x27;s collapse, tells him to leave for Italy but Min-woo agrees to leave only after Hye-won has regained consciousness. Soon, Hye-won wakes up and a deeply angered Jung-jae forbids Min-woo to see her, ordering him to leave on the spot. However, Min-woo agrees to leave only after Hye-won promises him to undergo heart surgery, for not having the operation would mean her certain demise.

Soon after his arrival in Italy, Min-woo receives a letter notifying him that Hye-won died during the operation. In fact, she has survived the initial surgery and gone to the United States for another heart transplant.

Three years later, with memories of Hye-won in his heart, Min-woo returns to Korea as the manager of an Art Centre. During his absence, Hye-won has undergone a heart transplant after the initial surgery, and then traveled to the United States for another transplant. On his way up the steps to the Art Centre and on her way down after her delivery, they meet again. The abnormal beating of Hye-won&#x27;s new heart signals Min-woo&#x27;s presence to her, and thus once and for all, confirms their love for each other to be authentic.

<text>Calliope is a rural town and locality in the Gladstone Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Calliope had a population of 5,263 people.

== Geography ==
Calliope is near the &#x27;cross-roads&#x27; of the Bruce Highway and the Dawson Highway in Central Queensland, SSW of the port city of Gladstone. Gladstone–Monto Road (State Route 69) runs south from the Dawson Highway through the locality.

== History ==

The town takes its name from the Calliope River, which in turn was named after HMS &quot;Calliope&quot; by the Governor of New South Wales, Charles Augustus FitzRoy, on 18 April 1854, after travelling from Sydney to Port Curtis on board that ship.

Industries of the town and surrounds since that time have included gold mining, beef, timber, and more recently heavy industry (Aluminium, Coal, LNG), shipping and tourism.

Alluvial gold was mined in the area after its discovery in 1862. The following year, Queensland&#x27;s first goldfield was officially proclaimed.

Calliope Post Office opened on 1 March 1864.

Calliope State School opened on 2 September 1872.

Booroom State School opened in 1911 and closed in 1939. Booroom is a parish west of Calliope.

== Demographics ==
In the , the locality of Calliope had a population of 3,058 people.

In the , the locality of Calliope had a population of 3,438 people.

In the , the locality of Calliope had a population of 5,263 people.

== Local attractions ==
The Calliope River Historical Village is situated on the banks of the Calliope River. Lake Awoonga resulted from the construction of a dam on the Boyne River. Lake Awoonga supplies water to the city of Gladstone, and Calliope and other townships in the region, as well as supplying the major industries for which the Gladstone region is known. Total capacity of Lake Awoonga is 777,000 megalitres (203,412,500,000 gallons). The catchment area contributing to the Lake is 2,240 square kilometres (864.87 square miles) and is surrounded by the Boyne, Dawes and Many Peaks Ranges.

Lake Awoonga is home to a thriving array of native animals, several of which are of conservation significance. Two fauna species are listed as vulnerable: the yellow-bellied glider and the grey-headed flying fox. For the bird-watching enthusiast, Lake Awoonga is a paradise with more than 225 species or over 27% of Australia&#x27;s bird species found in the region. The southern squatter pigeon is listed as vulnerable and of conservation significance, and twenty-seven species are listed on International Migratory Conservation Agreement lists. Lake Awoonga is arguably one of the most important near-coast bird refuges on the East Coast of Australia.

The Gladstone Area Water Board operates a fish hatchery which breeds barramundi and mangrove jack for release into Lake Awoonga. Barramundi over are regularly caught, and the heaviest caught by August 2008 weighed in at . In addition, the mangrove jack breeding program has resulted in Lake Awoonga holding the largest stocks in Australia with over 13,000 released. Since 1996 over two and a half million barramundi fingerlings and 340,000 mullet fingerlings have been released into Lake Awoonga.

Calliope has an 18-hole golf course with club and a bowls club. There are two pubs and an annual rodeo held each year. The town also has a swimming pool, racecourse, sports fields, Hazelbrook Park and a skateboard ramp.

Recent years have seen the introduction of a child care centre, supermarket shopping, specialty stores, doctors surgeries and other essential services. A large number of new homes and town houses have been built in Calliope due to its proximity to Gladstone Port and associated industries such as LNG.

== Amenities ==
Until 2008, Calliope was the council headquarters of the Calliope Shire which included Boyne Island, Tannum Sands, Ambrose, Mount Larcom and most of the industrial plants plus Awoonga dam. Calliope has now become one of the towns under the umbrella of the Gladstone Regional Council after the merger of the Calliope Shire Council and the former Gladstone City Council. GRC still maintain significant offices in Calliope.

The Calliope Library is on Don Cameron Drive; it is operated by the Gladstone Regional Council. There is a Gladstone Regional Council administration centre at 5 Don Cameron Drive.

Media: Calliope is serviced by Christian FM radio 87.6FM.

The Calliope branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association meets at the CWA Hall at 2 Bloomfield Street.

== Education ==
Calliope State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Stirrat Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 613 students with 48 teachers (41 full-time equivalent) and 24 non-teaching staff (16 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program.

After many years of lobbying from local residents fighting for a high school to be established in the town, Calliope State High School opened to students for the first time on 28 January 2020. A total of 165 students in Years 7 and 8 were the first students to attend the school. Facilities at the school include ten general learning spaces, 12 specialty learning spaces, a technology centre, a science centre, hospitality centre, a multi-purpose hall and an oval. An administration building, resource centre and a canteen were also among the new school&#x27;s facilities upon its opening.

<text>Kugelmugel, officially the Republic of Kugelmugel (), is a spherical art object located in Vienna, Austria.

It came about as the result of the artist Edwin Lipburger constructing the 8 square meter diameter spherical object without permissions from the authorities in Austria. After the dispute between the artist and authorities, the artist declared it a micronation, and it was eventually granted asylum by the then-mayor Helmut Zilk in Vienna where it is housed in the Prater park.

The &#x27;Republic&#x27; is currently administered by Linda Treiber as president.

==History==

In 1971, the 8 meter in diameter building was constructed by Edwin Lipburger and his son Nikolaus in Katzelsdorf near Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria. A prolonged dispute between the authorities and Lipburger ensued over the following years over the unpermitted construction. Lipburger declared Kugelmugel as its own micronation, even issuing passports. In August 1975, the township of Neudörfl offered to house the building and discussion of how to transport the building, potentially via helicopter were discussed, but ultimately didn&#x27;t pan out. In 1979, Lipburger was sentenced to prison for 10 weeks for &quot;unlawful assumption of a public authority&quot; ().

In 1982 the building was taken apart and transported to Vienna in the Prater park, near the Hauptallee, and surrounded by eight-foot-tall barbed-wire fences. The house occupies the only address within the proclaimed Republic: &quot;2., Antifaschismusplatz&quot; (&quot;2nd district of Vienna; Anti-Fascism Square&quot;). In 1982 the building was officially adopted by the city of Vienna by then-mayor Helmut Zilk who granted the object &quot;asylum&quot;. However it was then assumed by the city that the artistic object would only be temporary, so the legal dispute continued on with the city of Vienna after power and water was cut to Kugelmugel. Various lawsuits have been filed subsequently and eventually rose all the way to the Supreme Administrative Court of Austria in 2007. However all lawsuits failed with no formal agreement ever reached between Lipburger and the city. The city has stopped any attempts at reclaiming it and has accepted it as part of Vienna&#x27;s culture and is allowing the building in its existence as a &quot;building built without a permit&quot; ().

Lipburger died in January 2015, but the Republic retains an official population of more than 650 non-resident citizens. 
Following Lipburger&#x27;s passing, his son Nikolaus Lipburger took over the management of the nation. Subsequently in 2022, Nikolaus Lipburger hired Linda Treiber as new president of the nation to manage Kugelmugel.
Closed for sometime during the COVID-19 pandemic, the &quot;republic&quot; reopened its borders to visitors on the 1st of June 2024. Visitors get issued a &quot;visa permit&quot; with stamp and signature for a fee to visit the art nation.

In German, the word &quot;Kugel&quot; means &quot;ball&quot; or &quot;sphere&quot;; &quot;Mugel&quot; is an Austrian German expression for a bump or a hill on a field, from which mogul skiing is also derived.

== In popular culture ==
Kugelmugel is a character in &quot;&quot;, a Japanese webcomic, manga and anime about personified countries. In the series, Kugelmugel is a short boy with braids who has a passion for art and claims everything is art, referring to how Kugelmugel is an art object itself.

<doc id="1137385" wikidata="Q3373484" url="?curid=1137385" title="Hikurangi Trough">
<text>The Hikurangi Trough (previously known as the Hikurangi Trench) is a sea floor feature of the Pacific Ocean off the north-east South Island and the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It has been forming for about 25 million years and is turbidite-filled, particularly in its south. This characteristic can be used to distinguish it from the sediment-poor and deeper Kermadec Trench, which is its continuation to the north. Sediment currently passing through the trough represents about 0.5% of the total sediment input to the world oceans. The trough has deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems that are unique.

== Geography ==
Although shallower than the trenches north of it, the Hikurangi Trough reaches depths of as close as from shore. The southern trough structure is wide off the coast of northern Canterbury with an initial local depth of about , and towards its northern portions it has structures more like those found in oceanic trenches. The trough widens about the latitude of Cook Strait to between up to the Māhia Peninsula. There are various mappings of its northern limits as the Ruatōria debris avalanche was a poorly understood structure. The limits of the trough are not defined by standard geographical works and various geological works have different mappings.

A meandering depression within the trough like structure, the Hikurangi Channel (also known as Hikurangi Sea Channel or Hikurangi Seachannel), commences in the south and trends to the eastern side of the trough. By the latitude of Cook Strait the channel is about below the general level of the trough. The seafloor Hikurangi Channel continues along its eastern side, until at the Māhia Peninsula it breaks off towards the east through the Hikurangi Plateau and discharges into the south-west Pacific abyssal plains. The channel has a total length between , but only the initial portion is in the trough.

The trough to the south has related structures such as the undersea Pūkākī, Okains and Pegasus canyons at the latitude of Pegasus Bay, the Hurunui Canyon which is beyond the Hurunui River mouth, and the sudden coastal shelving to just south-east of Kaikōura of the Kaikōura Canyon, where the sea floor drops to the depth of the trough. Extending from the hilly coast north of Kaikōura the undersea Kowhai canyons are to the west of the trough. Towards the north eastern part of Cook Strait is the Cook Strait Canyon with part of the trough being deep. Off Cape Palliser, a part of the trough is deep, less than the Hikurangi Plateau&#x27;s on the eastern side of the trough at this latitude. The Hikurangi Plateau extends east of the trough between the Chatham Rise to the south and a point north of New Zealand&#x27;s East Cape. On the east coast of the North Island between the Pāhaoa and Māhia canyons there is not direct drainage from the coast into the trough as the seafloor has a number of intermediate ridges and basins. In terms of being a definite trench with two sides, this is found on the sea floor north of the Māhia Peninsula but is broken by the Tuaheni submarine landslide at about 38°50&#x27;S, and the submarine Ruatōria debris avalanche at about 38°S. Beyond the Ruatōria debris avalanche the Hikurangi Margin joins the Ruatōria Scarp and then drops away from the undersea East Cape Ridge and commences trench–like structures to depths of assigned by many authorities to the Kermadec Trench which further north has a distinct transition to a much greater depth.

== Geology ==
The Hikurangi Trough is sediment filled as a result of being a key part of the eastern New Zealand oceanic sedimentary system for several million years. The present North Island subduction and accretion that began in the middle and late Oligocene, caused thick sedimentary sequences to form in the then trench with enhanced abyssal erosion in the late Miocene. More recently it has sediment from the erosion of the uplifting mountains of the South Island of New Zealand such as the Southern Alps, which formed from 6.4 million years ago. This system currently contributes about 0.5% of the total sediment input to the world oceans. The sediments in the trench are up to deep in the south and where they exit the Kaikōura Canyon have acoustic characteristics of gravel turbidites. The turbidites thin to about in the north. Gas hydrates have been identified in the sediments and there are widespread methane seeps. Radiodating analysis of the carbonate rocks formed at such seeps show that the carbonate formation has been going on for periods between 2,360±70 years BP to 12,400±160 years BP.

The active turbidite channel represented by the Hikurangi Channel, guides turbidity currents into the path of the Pacific deep western boundary current to the north. The Hikurangi Channel is known to be less than 3.5 million years old. Initially the channel developed during the late Pliocene and extended along the Hikurangi Trench northwards. The sediments are predominantly delivered by submarine canyons and slope gullies that cut across or circumvent obstructions to flow, and the Kaikōura Canyon is known to be the dominant current active and longterm contributor in the case of the Hikurangi Trench. Exceptionally, the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake precipitated submarine mudslides and sediment flows that displaced about of sediment into the trench from the Kaikōura Canyon, with a turbidity current that travelled more than along the Hikurangi Channel. The furtherest marine core sampled in the channel so far revealed more than of fresh sediment. The full analysis is nuanced, with flows from ten turbide triggering catchments but also flows that may be due to submarine land sliding from shaking associated with ground-motion amplitude peaks that produce failure in muddy sediments. The catchment of the Cook Strait Canyon was a large contributor to the turbidite deposits from the earthquake.

=== Tectonics ===
The Hikurangi Margin subduction zone is where the thick oceanic Hikurangi Plateau has been subducting for about 25 million years beneath continental crust of the old Indo-Australian plate possibly without an intermediate continental crust microplate, although there are rotation features. The relative motion at the north is at East Cape and is down to at Cape Turnagain with regard to convergence. The net vector is to with a vector direction of 266° and in a direction of 259° at the Canterbury end. This is split into convergence near the trench, strike-slip motion around the top of the forearc ridge, and extension in the Taupō Rift. There is not a continuous trench with two sides at the margin and some complexity in the trench or trough like structures is due to the complex transitional tectonics and old subducting seamounts. By contrast, the Kermadec and Tonga trenches represent the parts of the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone where the oceanic crust of the Pacific plate is subducting beneath oceanic crust of the Kermadec and Tonga microplates which also abut oceanic crust of the current Australian plate.

== Ecology ==

Because of the delivery of waters by the Lower Circumpolar Deep Waters and current and coastal drainage and surface currents such as the East Cape Current a rich marine ecosystem exists in the coastal waters over the trench. The trench ecosystem itself has been much less studied as it is even deeper than the economically important deep marine fisheries. The middle and southern Hikurangi Margin includes fisheries for hoki, alfonsino and orange roughy. The far south area of the trough near the Kaikōura Canyon, the Subtropical Front forms a convergence zone between the subtropical and subantarctic water masses represented by the Southland Current down to about . This region of ocean has been determined to be one of the most productive marine ecosystems on the planet. At this end of the trench, many deep water species are found close to the shore. This food source attracts the whales for which the town of Kaikōura is famous. The 2016 Kaikōura earthquake profoundly disturbed this ecosystem, but there is evidence of recovery.

In one study, biological sampling of the walls of the trough took place at six sites between deep. Compared to similar sampling in the more northern Bay of Plenty there were higher abundances in the Hikurangi Margin of many crustaceans and worms such as mud dragons, ostracods, nematode worms, copepods, tanaidacea, segmented worms, isopods and amphipods.

=== Methane seeps ===
In the trough itself, deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems are associated with methane cold seeps that with authigenesis usually create carbonate mounds. The single cell organisms responsible for these ecosystems are similar to those found at methane seeps worldwide. Unlike other areas of the deep ocean no methane–associated mud volcanoes have been found on the margin.

Bacterial mats, often white, are seen in video imaging. Some of these systems differ from any others so far described worldwide. For example, there are dense populations of bristle worms in dark sulphide-rich soft sediment microhabitats where there is a high flux of both methane and sulphides. These dark patches have distinctive pitting associated with the worm burrows. Because bristle worms are found at cold seeps worldwide it is possible that the role of aerobic methanotrophy may have been underestimated in seafloor methane chemosynthetic ecosystems, as over 25% of the methane escaping from the Hikurangi Margin cold seeps is metabolised aerobically.
In general such methane seeps have anaerobic single cell organisms in the subsurface anoxic layers, with anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing myxococcota. In highly reduced seep habitats the surface is dominated by bacterial mats, while where partial oxidation has happened the bristle worm ecosystem previously mentioned is found associated with aerobic methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. Genetically, many of these have been characterised as related to the chemosynthetic endosymbionts of marine invertebrates. Sulfide is exploited as an energy resource by both the tubeworms and the clams. With more advanced oxidation the ecosystem becomes dominated by chemosynthetic frenulate tubeworms of the genus &quot;Lamellibrachia&quot; closely related to those found in the Lau Basin, and clams, mussels, and various &quot;Demospongiae&quot; sponges. The saltwater clams are of the genus &quot;Calyptogena&quot;, the mussels are in the deep-sea sub-family &quot;Bathymodiolinae&quot;.

<doc id="1137386" wikidata="Q17017062" url="?curid=1137386" title="Just Won't Burn">
<text>Just Won&#x27;t Burn is the second studio album by American blues artist Susan Tedeschi, recorded in 1997. The album had national success upon release in 1998. An expanded 25th Anniversary edition of the album was released in 2023.

==Reception==

The album earned Tedeschi a nomination for &quot;Best New Artist&quot; at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.

&quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Chris Morris called the album &quot;a striking showcase for her gravel-voiced shouting and fiery axework,&quot; and noted that she is being &quot;pegged... as a rising successor to Bonnie Raitt.&quot;

Jana Pendragon of AllMusic stated that Tedeschi &quot;slings, aims, and hits her target,&quot; and commented: &quot;What a talent! Singer, songwriter, player, performer, and more, the lady from Boston can do it all... A brave heart with spunk and plenty of soul.&quot;

The authors of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings&quot; wrote that, in relation to her previous release, &quot;Just Won&#x27;t Burn&quot; features songwriting that is &quot;both more stylish... and... markedly more personal.&quot;

Writing for &quot;JazzTimes&quot;, Bill Milkowski remarked: &quot;She sings and plays with a lot of heart and also demonstrates a talent for songwriting on this strong debut. Yeah, she&#x27;s real.&quot;

Ed Kopp of &quot;All About Jazz&quot; described the album as &quot;a perfect vehicle for Tedeschi&#x27;s powerful singing,&quot; which, he noted, is &quot;emotionally charged and very engaging.&quot;

&quot;The Music Box&quot;&#x27;s John Metzger called the album &quot;a truly amazing effort that is full of promise for the future, even as it looks to the past,&quot; and wrote: &quot;Tedeschi is the real deal, and... the comparisons to Joplin and Raitt truly are warranted. She approaches songs with the same level of passion, hiding her pain beneath the strength of her voice.&quot;

<doc id="1137395" wikidata="Q271598" url="?curid=1137395" title="Fishing net">
<text>A fishing net is a net used for fishing. Some fishing nets are also called fish traps, for example fyke nets. Fishing nets are usually meshes formed by knotting a relatively thin thread. Early nets were woven from grasses, flaxes and other fibrous plant material. Later cotton was used. Modern nets are usually made of artificial polyamides like nylon, although nets of organic polyamides such as wool or silk thread were common until recently and are still used.

==History==

Fishing nets have been used widely in the past, including by stone age societies. The oldest known fishing net is the net of Antrea, found with other fishing equipment in the Karelian town of Antrea, Finland, in 1913. The net was made from willow, and dates back to 8300 BC. Recently, fishing net sinkers from 27,000 BC were discovered in Korea, making them the oldest fishing implements discovered, to date, in the world. The remnants of another fishing net dates back to the late Mesolithic, and were found together with sinkers at the bottom of a former sea. Some of the oldest rock carvings at Alta (4200–500 BC) have mysterious images, including intricate patterns of horizontal and vertical lines sometimes explained as fishing nets. American Native Indians on the Columbia River wove seine nets from spruce root fibers or wild grass, again using stones as weights. For floats they used sticks made of cedar which moved in a way which frightened the fish and helped keep them together. With the help of large canoes, pre-European Maori deployed seine nets which could be over one thousand metres long. The nets were woven from green flax, with stone weights and light wood or gourd floats, and could require hundreds of men to haul.

Fishing nets are well documented in antiquity. They appear in Egyptian tomb paintings from 3000 BC. In ancient Roman literature, Ovid makes many references to fishing nets, including the use of cork floats and lead weights. Pictorial evidence of Roman fishing comes from mosaics which show nets. In a parody of fishing, a type of gladiator called retiarius was armed with a trident and a cast net. He would fight against a secutor or the murmillo, who carried a short sword and a helmet with the image of a fish on the front. Between 177 and 180 the Greek author Oppian wrote the &quot;Halieutica&quot;, a didactic poem about fishing. He described various means of fishing including the use of nets cast from boats, scoop nets held open by a hoop, and various traps &quot;which work while their masters sleep&quot;. Here is Oppian&#x27;s description of fishing with a &quot;motionless&quot; net:

The fishers set up very light nets of buoyant flax and wheel in a circle round about while they violently strike the surface of the sea with their oars and make a din with sweeping blow of poles. At the flashing of the swift oars and the noise the fish bound in terror and rush into the bosom of the net which stands at rest, thinking it to be a shelter: foolish fishes which, frightened by a noise, enter the gates of doom. Then the fishers on either side hasten with the ropes to draw the net ashore.
In Norse mythology the sea giantess Rán uses a fishing net to trap lost sailors. References to fishing nets can also be found in the New Testament. Jesus Christ was reputedly a master in the use of fishing nets. The tough, fibrous inner bark of the pawpaw was used by Native Americans and settlers in the Midwest for making ropes and fishing nets. The archaeological site at León Viejo (1524–1610) has fishing net artifacts including fragments of pottery used as weights for fishing nets.

Fishing nets have not evolved greatly, and many contemporary fishing nets would be recognized for what they are in Neolithic times. However, the fishing lines from which the nets are constructed have hugely evolved. Fossilised fragments of &quot;probably two-ply laid rope of about 7 mm diameter&quot; have been found in one of the caves at Lascaux, dated about 15,000 BC. Egyptian rope dates back to 4000 to 3500 BC and was generally made of water reed fibers. Other rope in antiquity was made from the fibers of date palms, flax, grass, papyrus, leather, or animal hair. Rope made of hemp fibres was in use in China from about 2800 BC. 

In modern times, hemp was almost the only material in large scale use in fishing gear until 1900 when it found competition from cotton. By 1950s cotton had taken over a large fraction of fishing nets, although hemp nets were still in use in large quantities. The first nylon fishing nets emerged in Japan in 1949 (although tests of similar equipment were taking place around the world in the last years of the 1940s). In the 1950s they were adopted worldwide, replacing nets made from cotton or hemp that were used before. The introduction of synthetic fibres in fishing gear from around 1950 changed a way of using natural materials that goes back several thousands of years. In the following decades (for example in Norway in 1975, 95% of all fishing gear was made of synthetic fibre), the new synthetic materials conquered the hegemony in net fishing.


==Types==

==Fishing lines==
Ropes and lines are made of fibre lengths, twisted or braided together to provide tensile strength. They are used for pulling, but not for pushing. The availability of reliable and durable ropes and lines has had many consequences for the development and utility of fishing nets, and influences particularly the scale at which the nets can be deployed.

==Floats==

Some types of fishing nets, like seine and trammel, need to be kept hanging vertically in the water by means of floats at the top. Various light &quot;corkwood&quot;-type woods have been used around the world as fishing floats. Floats come in different sizes and shapes. These days they are often brightly coloured so they are easy to see.

* Small floats were usually made of cork, but fishermen in places where cork was not available used other materials, like birch bark in Sweden, Finland, and Russia, as well as the pneumatophores of mangrove apple in Southeast Asia. These materials have now largely been replaced by plastic foam.
* Subsistence fishermen in some areas of Southeast Asia make corks for fishing nets by shaping the pneumatophores of mangrove apple into small floats.
*Across the Indo-Pacific ocean, many subsistence fishermen utilise discarded flip-flops as floats. This is especially common in the Western Indian Ocean on drag nets made from mosquito nets.
* &quot;Entelea&quot;: The wood was used by Māori for the floats of fishing nets
* Native Hawaiians made fishing net floats from low density wiliwili wood.
* Glass floats were large glass balls for long oceanic nets, now substituted by hard plastic. They were used by fishermen in many parts of the world, not only to keep fishing nets afloat, but also for dropline and longline fishing. Often larger floats have marker flags for easier spotting. Glass floats are now collectors&#x27; items. 

==Weights and anchors==
The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, BC to 2750 BC in Eastern Europe, created ceramic weights in various shapes and sizes which were used as loom weights when weaving, and also were attached to fishing nets.

Despite their ornamental value, dog conches are traditionally used by local fishermen as sinkers for their fishing nets.

==Production==
Fishing nets are usually manufactured on industrial looms, though traditional methods are still used where the nets are woven by hand and assembled in home or cottage industries.

==Environmental impact==
Fisheries often use large-scale nets that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along; sea turtle, dolphin, or shark. Bycatch is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths. Longline, trawl, and gillnet fishing are three types of fishing with the most sea turtle accidents. Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the sea turtle was ensnared and could not come up for air. Cubs of endangered Saimaa ringed seal also drown to fishing nets.

Fishing nets, usually made of plastic, can be left or lost in the ocean by fishermen. Known as ghost nets, these entangle fish, whales, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other creatures, restricting movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and, in those that need to return to the surface to breathe, suffocation.

==Miscellany==

Divers may become trapped in fishing nets; monofilament is almost invisible underwater. Divers often carry a net cutter. This is a small handheld tool carried by scuba divers to extricate themselves if trapped by a fishing net or fishing line. It has a small sharp blade such as a replaceable scalpel blade inside the small notch. There is a small hole at the other end to for a lanyard to tether the cutter to the diver.

<text>The baffles is the area in the water directly behind a submarine or ship through which a hull-mounted sonar cannot hear. This blind spot is caused by the need to insulate the sonar array, commonly mounted near the bow, from the noise of the vessel&#x27;s machinery.

During the Cold War, one submarine would frequently attempt to follow another by hiding in its baffles. This led to the practice of &quot;clearing the baffles&quot;, that is, turning to observe the blind spot and detect any followers. Related maneuvers included the &quot;Crazy Ivan&quot;, a hard turn to clear the baffles and position the submarine to attack any followers, and &quot;Angles and Dangles&quot;, a five-hour process of rapid direction and speed changes to ensure that all items aboard were properly for hard maneuvering and would not fall or shift suddenly, producing noise that the enemy could detect. The baffles-clearing maneuvers undertaken by Soviet &quot;Yankee&quot;-class submarines were dubbed &quot;Yankee Doodles&quot;.

Hiding in a sub&#x27;s baffles is dangerous because of the risk of collision. Such tactics have fallen out of use since the advent of the towed-array sonar, which negates the baffles&#x27; blind spot.

==Background and etymology==
Since a sonar array is extremely sensitive to underwater sounds, it must be protected from the noise generated by machinery on the vessel on which the sonar is installed. Otherwise, its own noise would tend to drown out other sonar targets, making the sonar array ineffective. To reduce noise, sound-attenuating material is placed between the sonar and the rest of the vessel. This makes the sonar much more effective, but causes a blind spot where this material is: as most hull-mounted sonars are located at the front of the vessel; the ship&#x27;s bow, the resulting blind spot is located directly behind the array, most commonly sternwards.

The term baffles is likely derived from a of the word itself, that of &quot;a partition that prevents interference between sound waves in a loudspeaker.&quot; In the instance of its usage in terminology pertaining to submarines, the definition can be expanded and slightly modified to, &quot;an area behind the submarine that due to the cavitation and the wake left by the propulsion system impedes the ability for on-board sonar systems to accurately establish what, if anything, is behind the submarine.&quot;

==Maneuvers related to the baffles==
===Clearing the baffle area===
A submarine tracking another submarine can take advantage of its target&#x27;s baffles to follow at a close distance without being detected. Periodically, a submarine will perform a maneuver called &quot;clearing the baffles&quot;, in which the boat will turn left or right far enough to listen with the forward array sonar for a few minutes in the area that was previously blocked by the baffles. Good tactics require a submarine to clear baffles at irregular intervals and in different directions so that a pursuing submarine cannot predict when and how the next baffle-clearing maneuver will be made. When a submarine clears its baffles, a pursuing submarine must take measures to avoid detection by, or worse, collision with, the submarine ahead.

In some cases, submarine commanders could choose to clear baffles by executing one or a series of hard turns in order to not only clear the baffles, but also be in a favorable position to attack the potentially following submarine. Such extreme maneuvers were more commonly used by Soviet Navy submarines during the Cold War than by other forces, leading to the maneuver&#x27;s nickname: &quot;Crazy Ivan&quot;. The &quot;crazy&quot; came from the danger such a maneuver posed to both submarines, first being detection of the following submarine, which was commonly avoided by stopping the engines and going to maximum silence, and secondly by collision, as the momentum of the pursuing boat could result in collision with the leading submarine. The sudden, unexpected nature of the maneuver led to the term being used in the English-speaking world.

The term &quot;Crazy Ivan&quot; has sometimes separately been used to describe the possibility of a rogue Soviet leader committing to military action, typically in reference to a limited launch of ICBMs against the US, originating from the Tom Clancy novel &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

===Angles and Dangles===
Although not specifically a baffle-clearing maneuver, the exercise known as &quot;Angles and Dangles&quot; (a series of random figure eights, sharp turns, and depth changes) is intended to eliminate the unintended self-noise which could occur during a baffle-clearing event. The exercise is executed at the start of a voyage to determine if loose items aboard the submarine are properly stowed for maneuvers; loose items can fall or shift position during the sudden maneuvers required during baffle clearing, making noise that could be detected by the opposing submarine.

===Use of towed array sonars===
Nuclear submarines of the late Cold War and contemporary era, starting with the Soviet Project 667BDR, Project 671RTM/K, and American USS Narwhal, and ships, especially those equipped for anti-submarine warfare, carry a towed array sonar: a sonar sensor mounted on a long tow cable streamed out behind the vessel. This detects acoustic energy in the area behind the ship, reducing or even removing the need for baffle-clearing maneuvers. One reason for this is that towed-array sonars typically have a different frequency response than hull-mounted sonar sensors. Towed array sensors have conical-shaped beams and these beams become very broad when steered in a direction aligned with the array elements, known as the &quot;end-fire&quot; direction. As a result, have poor directivity in the &quot;end-fire&quot; regions of the array.

<doc id="1137411" wikidata="Q4898461" url="?curid=1137411" title="Better Days (Susan Tedeschi album)">
<text>Better Days is the debut album by American blues artist Susan Tedeschi, originally released in 1995 under the name Susan Tedeschi Band, but later re-released in 1998 after she found national success with &quot;Just Won&#x27;t Burn&quot;.

==Reception==

In a review for AllMusic, Erik Crawford stated that the album &quot;finds Tedeschi&#x27;s guitar prowess and eminent vocals proliferating the musical landscape in the same manner of blues legends who have gone before her,&quot; and wrote that she has &quot;proven herself worthy of sharing the stage with the masters.&quot;

The authors of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings&quot; praised Tedeschi&#x27;s voice, describing it as &quot;rich in volume, consistency and natural ease, with a use of melisma that hints at classic soul.&quot; However, they criticized her lyrics, noting that they &quot;undermine the authority that [she] establishes with her voice.&quot;

<doc id="1137413" wikidata="Q7252681" url="?curid=1137413" title="Provincial secretary">
<text>The provincial secretary was a senior position in the executive councils of British North America&#x27;s colonial governments, and was retained by the Canadian provincial governments for at least a century after Canadian Confederation was proclaimed in 1867. The position has been abolished in almost all provinces in recent decades (Quebec in 1970, Ontario 1985, most recently by British Columbia in 2000); the exceptions are Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia, where it still exists but is no longer a standalone senior portfolio (in Nova Scotia it is held by Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Nova Scotia since 1993, but co-held with Government Services and Consumer Affairs from 1980 to 1993; held by the Premier 1848 to 1878 and Provincial Treasurer 1878 to 1946).

== History ==
The position existed prior to Confederation in the Province of Canada (as well as in the previous provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada) and the various governments in Atlantic Canada under British rule, though in Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island the title was colonial secretary. British Columbia also had a colonial secretary prior to becoming a province of Canada in 1871. Before the granting of responsible government and the emergence of the position of premier, the provincial secretary was the leading position in the executive councils appointed by the various governors and lieutenant-governors of British North America. Frequently, provincial secretaries during these periods were the most powerful elected representatives in their jurisdictions.

The provincial secretary was the equivalent of the former Canadian Cabinet position of Secretary of State for Canada. Like its federal counterpart it included an eclectic variety of responsibilities that were not assigned to other ministers, most of which would eventually evolve into portfolios of their own. In Nova Scotia, where the position originated in 1720, the provincial secretary was also the treasurer of the province until 1946. The provincial secretary was also responsible for official communications between the provincial government and the Colonial Office in London as well as with other provincial and colonial governments (and after 1867 the federal government). As well, the position also included various duties related to ceremonial occasions, visits by dignitaries, protocol, relations between the government and the office of lieutenant-governor and commemorative events particularly in relation to the monarchy.

Generally, the provincial secretary acted as a province&#x27;s registrar-general and was responsible for formal documents and records such as licences, birth and death certificates, land registries and surveys, business registrations and writs. As well, the position was generally responsible for the administration of the civil service and of elections. Provincial secretaries were usually the most senior member of the provincial cabinet outside of the premier, and the office holder was often designated as acting premier when the premier was out of province, ill or otherwise unavailable.

The position of provincial secretary was particularly important in Manitoba from 1870 to 1874, as that province&#x27;s institutions were being established. The province had no premier during this period, and its lieutenant-governors acted as the de facto leaders of government. The early provincial secretaries (including Alfred Boyd and Henry Joseph Clarke) were the most prominent elected officials in the province, and are retroactively regarded as premiers in many modern sources.

The provincial secretary continued to oversee miscellaneous government activities into the twentieth-century (Nova Scotia&#x27;s &quot;Public Service Act&quot; conferred on the position responsibility for all matters not specifically assigned to any other minister). Frequently, twentieth-century provincial secretaries would concurrently hold other cabinet portfolios.

==Non-governmental==
In many organizations in Canada the provincial secretary is also the name of a senior officer at the provincial level. The Monarchist League of Canada, for instance, has provincial secretaries in various parts of the country who are primarily responsible for the organizing the league&#x27;s activities in a specific province.

In the provincial sections of the New Democratic Party, the provincial secretary is the senior administrative officer, and may be by title or function chief executive officer, of the non-parliamentary wing of the party and is responsible for organizing provincial conventions, provincial councils and other meetings, membership drives, fundraising and other day-to-day operations. As well, the provincial secretary usually has a senior role in administering the party&#x27;s electoral campaigns.

<doc id="1137419" wikidata="Q891381" url="?curid=1137419" title="Porophyllum ruderale">
<text>Porophyllum ruderale is an herbaceous annual plant whose leaves can be used for seasoning food. The taste has been described as &quot;somewhere between arugula, cilantro and rue&quot;. The plant is commonly grown in Mexico and South America for use in salsas. When fully grown, the plant measures about in height and in diameter.

The plant is easy to grow from seed in a well-drained soil, which should be allowed to dry between watering.

==Culture==

Having been used by many cultures, Porophyllum ruderale is known by many names, including Bolivian coriander, quillquiña (also spelled quirquiña or quilquiña), yerba porosa, killi, pápalo, tepegua, rupay wachi, mampuritu, pápaloquelite and summer cilantro. Despite the name &quot;Bolivian coriander&quot; and &quot;summer cilantro&quot;, this plant is not botanically related to &quot;Coriandrum sativum&quot;.

The terms pápaloquelite and pápalo are used in Mexico, and the herb there commonly accompanies tacos. Not all Mexicans enjoy its taste, but some find that it improves the flavor of tacos and typical Mexican salsas and soups.

In Bolivia it is typically used as an ingredient along with tomatoes and locotos to prepare llajwa.

In Puebla cuisine, pápalo is used as a condiment on traditional cemita sandwiches, a regional type of Mexican torta.

Pápalo was used in the Azteca era, but never as medicine, only as food.

<text>Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with over 90 genera and just over 680 species. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as &quot;plecos&quot;, notably the suckermouth catfish, &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot;, and are popular as aquarium fish.

==Common names==
Members of the family Loricariidae are commonly referred to as loricariids, suckermouth catfishes, armoured catfish, or suckermouth armoured catfish. The name &quot;plecostomus&quot;, and its shortened forms &quot;pleco&quot; and &quot;plec&quot;, are used for many Loricariidae, since &quot;Plecostomus plecostomus&quot; (now called &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot;) was one of the first loricariid species imported for the fish-keeping hobby.

Some loricariids are not normally considered &quot;plecostomus&quot;, such as &quot;Farlowella&quot; catfish.

In their native range, these fish are known as &quot;cascudos&quot; or &quot;acarís&quot;.

===L-numbers===

Some types of loricariids are often referred to by their &#x27;L-number&#x27;; this has become common since imports of loricariid catfish from South America often included specimens that had not been taxonomically described. Currently, L-numbers are used not only by fish-keeping enthusiasts, but also by biologists, since they represent a useful stopgap until a new species of fish is given a full taxonomic name. In some cases, two different L-numbered catfish have turned out to be different populations of the same species, while in other cases, multiple (but superficially similar) species have all been traded under a single L-number. 

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Because of their highly specialized morphology, loricariids have been recognized as a monophyletic assemblage in even the earliest classifications of the Siluriformes, meaning they consist of a natural grouping with a common ancestor and all of its descendants. Loricariidae is one of seven families in the superfamily Loricarioidea, along with Amphiliidae, Trichomycteridae, Nematogenyidae, Callichthyidae, Scoloplacidae, and Astroblepidae. Some of these families also exhibit suckermouths or armor, although never in the same individual, as in loricariids.

This is the largest catfish family, including about 684 species in around 92 genera, with new species being described each year. However, this family is in flux, and revisions are likely. For example, the subfamily Ancistrinae is accepted as late as the 2006 edition of Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;; it later becomes grouped as a tribe, because of its recognition as a sister group to the Pterygoplichthyini. Under Ambruster, six subfamilies are recognized: Delturinae, Hypoptopomatinae, Hypostominae, Lithogeneinae, Loricariinae, and Neoplecostominae.

Monophyly for the family is strongly supported, except, possibly, the inclusion of &quot;Lithogenes&quot;. &quot;Lithogenes&quot; is the only genus within the subfamily Lithogeneinae. This genus and subfamily, the most basal group in Loricariidae, is the sister group to the rest of the family. Neoplecostominae are the most basal group among the loricariids with the exception of Lithogeneinae. However, the genera of Neoplecostominae do not appear to form a monophyletic assemblage. The two subfamilies Loricariinae and Hypoptopomatinae appear to be generally regarded as monophyletic. However, the monophyly and composition of the other subfamilies are currently being examined and will likely be altered substantially in the future. The Hypostominae are the largest subfamily of Loricariidae. It is made up of five tribes. Four of the five tribes, Corymbophanini, Hypostomini, Pterygoplichthyini, and Rhinelepini, include about 24 genera. The fifth and largest tribe, Ancistrini (formerly recognized as its own subfamily), includes 30 genera.

Loricariid fossils are extremely rare. The earliest known definitive taxon is &quot;Taubateia&quot; from the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene in Brazil. The putative Cenomanian member &quot;Afrocascudo&quot;, initially described as the earliest loricariid catfish in 2024, might represent a juvenile obaichthyid lepisosteiform, possibly a junior synonym of &quot;Obaichthys&quot;, though this has been disputed based on the complete ossification of the bones indicating full maturity and the absence of important holostean characters. Within the superfamily Loricarioidea, the Loricariidae are the most derived; in this superfamily, the trend is toward increasingly complex jaw morphology, which may have allowed for the great diversification of the Loricariidae, which have the most advanced jaws.

==Distribution and habitat==
The family Loricariidae is vastly distributed over both the east and west sides of the Andes mountains, however, most species are generally restricted to small geographic ranges. They are primarily found in freshwater habitats of South America, but several loricariines and hypostomines are native to Panama, and two species (&quot;Fonchiiichthys uracanthus&quot; and &quot;Hemiancistrus aspidolepis&quot;) are native to Costa Rica. Species occur in swift-flowing streams from the lowlands up to in elevation. They can also be found in a variety of other freshwater environments. They can be found in torrential mountain rivers, quiet brackish estuaries, black acidic waters, and even in subterranean habitats.

==Description and biology==
This family has extremely variable color patterns and body shapes. Loricariids are characterized by bony plates covering their bodies, similar to the bony plates in callichthyids. (In Latin, &quot;lorica&quot; means corselet). These fish exhibit a ventral suckermouth, with e (small projections) on the lips. When present, the adipose fin usually has a spine at the forward edge. These fish have, when they are present, a unique pair of maxillary barbels. These fish have relatively long intestines due to their usually herbivorous or detrivorous diets. The body is characteristically flattened in this family. Taste buds cover almost the entire surface of the body and fin spines. Body lengths can range from in &quot;Nannoplecostomus eleonorae&quot; to over in &quot;Panaque&quot;, &quot;Acanthicus&quot;, and &quot;Pterygoplichthys&quot;.

One of the most obvious characteristics of the loricariids is the suckermouth. The modified mouth and lips allow the fish to feed, breathe, and attach to the substrate through suction. The lips were once believed to be unable to function as a sucker while respiration continued, as the inflowing water would cause the system to fail; however, respiration and suction can function simultaneously. Inflowing water passing under the sucker is limited to a thin stream immediately behind each maxillary barbel; the maxillae in loricariids support only small maxillary barbels and are primarily used to mediate the lateral lip tissue in which they are embedded, preventing failure of suction during inspiration. To achieve suction, the fish presses its lips against the substrate and expands its oral cavity, causing negative pressure.

Also, unlike most other catfishes, the premaxillae are highly mobile, and the lower jaws have evolved towards a medial position, with the teeth pointed ; these are important evolutionary innovations. The fish rotates its lower and upper jaws to scrape the substrate. Of the two, the lower jaws are more mobile.

Loricariid catfishes have evolved several modifications of their digestive tracts that function as accessory respiratory organs or hydrostatic organs. These complex structures would have been independently evolved a number of times within the family. This includes an enlarged stomach in the Pterygoplichthyini, &quot;Hypostomus&quot;, and &quot;Lithoxus&quot;, a U-shaped diverticulum in Rhinelepini, and a ring-like diverticulum in &quot;Otocinclus&quot;. It may be noted that even loricariids with unmodified stomachs have a slight ability to breathe air.

Considerable sexual dimorphism occurs in this family, most pronounced during the breeding season. For example, in &quot;Loricariichthys&quot;, the male has a large expansion of its lower lip, which it uses to hold a clutch of eggs. &quot;Ancistrus&quot; males have snouts with fleshy tentacles. In loricariids, odontodes develop almost anywhere on the external surface of the body and first appear soon after hatching; odontodes appear in a variety of shapes and sizes and are often sexually dimorphic, being larger in breeding males. In most Ancistrini species, sharp evertible cheek spines (elongated odontodes) are often more developed in males and are used in intraspecific displays and combat.

=== Omega iris ===

Unusual for bony fish, many species have a modified iris called an omega iris. The dorsal segment of the iris expands downward over the pupil to form a loop which can expand and contract, called an iris operculum; when light levels are high, the pupil reduces in diameter and the loop expands to cover the center of the pupil, giving rise to a crescent-shaped, light-transmitting partial pupil. This feature gets its name from its similarity to an upside-down uppercase Greek letter omega (Ω). The origins of this structure are unknown, but breaking up the outline of the highly visible eye has been suggested to aid camouflage in what are often highly mottled animals. Species in the tribe Rhinelepini are an exceptional group among loricariids, having a circular iris. The presence or absence of the iris operculum can be used for identification of species in the subfamily Loricariinae.

==Genetics==

As of 2000, only 56 loricariid species have been cytogenically investigated. The basal diploid number of chromosomes is 2n = 54 in this family, but with a wide variation in the chromosome number in this fish group, ranging from 2n = 36 in the Loricariinae, &quot;Rineloricaria latirostris&quot;, to 2n = 96 in a species of &quot;Upsilodus&quot; (&quot;Hemipsilichthys&quot;). Most members of the Ancistrini and Pterygoplichthyini have 52 chromosomes. Karyotypic evolution by means of centric fusions and centric fissions seems to be a common feature among loricariids; this is demonstrated by a higher number of biarmed chromosomes in species with lower diploid number and many uniarmed chromosomes in species with higher diploid numbers. Studies conducted with representatives of some genera of Hypostominae showed, within this group, the diploid number ranges from 2n = 52 to 2n = 80. However, the supposed wide karyotypic diversity the family Loricariidae or the subfamily Hypostominae
would present is almost exclusively restricted to the genus &quot;Hypostomus&quot;, and the species from the other genera had a conserved diploid number. In some species, there is a ZZ/ZW sex-determination system.

==Ecology==

The suckermouth exhibited by these catfish allows them to adhere to objects in their habitats, even in fast-flowing waters. The mouth and teeth also are adapted to feed on a variety of foods, such as algae, invertebrates, and detritus. Some species, notably the &quot;Panaque&quot;, are known for xylophagy, or the ability to digest wood.

Most species of loricariids are nocturnal animals. Some species are territorial, while others, such as &quot;Otocinclus&quot;, prefer to live in groups.

Air-breathing is well known among many loricariids; this ability is dependent on the risk of hypoxia faced by a species; torrent-dwelling species tend to have no ability to breathe air, while low-land, pool-dwelling species, such as those of &quot;Hypostomus&quot;, have a great ability to breathe air. &quot;Pterygoplichthys&quot; is known for being kept out of water and sold alive in fish markets, surviving up to 30 hours out of water. Loricariids are facultative air breathers; they will only breathe air if under stress and will only use their gills in situations when oxygen levels are high. The dry season is a likely time for this; there would be little food in the stomach, which would allow its use for air breathing.

Loricariids exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, including cavity spawning, attachment of eggs on the underside of rocks, and egg-carrying. Parental care is usually good, and the male guards the eggs and sometimes the larvae. The eggs hatch after four to 20 days, depending on the species.

Three species known from subterranean habitats are true troglobites with reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes: &quot;Ancistrus cryptophthalmus&quot;, &quot;A. galani&quot; and &quot;A. formoso&quot;. Similar adaptions with reduced pigmentation are known from two loricariids found in deep water in large Amazonian rivers, &quot;Peckoltia pankimpuju&quot; and &quot;Panaque bathyphilus&quot;.

==In the aquarium==

Loricariids are popular aquarium fish, where they are often sold as &quot;plecs&quot;, &quot;plecos&quot; or &quot;plecostomus&quot;. These fish are often purchased because of their algae-eating habits, though this role may not be carried out. Loricariid are either vegetarian, omnivore, carnivore or wood-eaters. A great many species of loricariids are also sold for their ornamental qualities, representing many body shapes and colors.

Most species of loricariids are nocturnal and will shy away from bright light, appreciating some sort of cover to hide under throughout the day. As they often originate from habitats with fast-moving water, filtration should be vigorous.

A number of species of loricariids have been bred in captivity.

<doc id="1137426" wikidata="Q570401" url="?curid=1137426" title="Anstruther">
<text>Anstruther ( ; ) is a coastal town in Fife, Scotland, situated on the north-shore of the Firth of Forth and south-southeast of St Andrews. The town comprises two settlements, Anstruther Easter and Anstruther Wester, which are divided by a stream, the Dreel Burn. With a population of 3,500, it is the largest community on the Firth of Forth&#x27;s north-shore coastline known as the East Neuk. To the east, it merges with the village of Cellardyke.

==Description==
Founded as a fishing village, Anstruther is home to the Scottish Fisheries Museum. Recreational vessels are now moored in the harbour, and a golf course is situated near the town. Anstruther Pleasure Cruises operate sightseeing/wildlife cruises from the harbour to the Isle of May, the UK&#x27;s primary puffin location, on board the vessel the &quot;May Princess&quot; from April to October. An abundance of other wildlife, including seal colonies, also inhabit the island.

The Waid Academy, the local state comprehensive school, is a focus of the community and through its secondary role as a community centre. Anstruther has a parish church at its centre that is on a small hill. This structure incorporates a tower/spire feature rare to Britain, but common to the area.

Anstruther War Memorial is located in the cemetery, somewhat further inland. It is of an unusual war memorial form, being totally flat to the ground, in the centre of a landscaped roundel, broadly adopting the shape of a celtic cross.

The town has several fish and chip shops. The Anstruther Fish Bar, which won Fish and Chip shop of the year in 2001–2002, was awarded the same prize once again by the Sea Fish Organisation in 2009.

Anstruther is home to Scotland&#x27;s only true-scale model Solar System. The model, which shows the Sun and planets and the distances between them all at the same scale of 1 to ten thousand million, is located mostly in the town centre. It stretches almost 600 m from the Sun to Pluto.

Anstruther is close to the Caves of Caiplie situated on the coastal path to Crail.
Following the end of the Cold War, one of Anstruther&#x27;s best-kept secrets has become a major tourist attraction. A secret nuclear bunker, built in 1951 and operational until 1993, is located on the B940 near the village. During its operational life, it looked like an ordinary domestic dwelling, but has been renovated and is now open to the public as a museum. The bunker was a subsidiary Regional Seat of Government in time of possible nuclear emergency and would have been occupied by the UK Armed Forces, UKWMO, Royal Observer Corps and other Civil Service personnel.

Somewhat out from the town centre, in Anstruther Wester, stands the Dreel Tavern, taking its name from the adjacent burn. This building dates from the 17th century. Nearby is Buckie House, built in the late 17th century and restored in 1968 by W Murray Jack. The east gable was decorated with scallop shells and whelks or &#x27;buckies&#x27; by the slater Andrew Batchelor in the mid 19th century. Its exterior was restored in 2010.

==History==
The name of Anstruther derives from Scottish Gaelic. The second element is &quot;sruthair&quot; (&#x27;burn, stream&#x27;), but the first element less certain: it is possibly Gaelic &quot;á(i)n&quot; (&#x27;driving&#x27;) or &quot;aon&quot; (&#x27;one&#x27;), thus meaning either &#x27;driving current or burn&#x27; or &#x27;(place of or on) one burn&#x27;. The name of Anstruther Easter derives from Scots &quot;easter&quot; (&#x27;eastern&#x27;), since the village lies to the east of Anstruther, and Anstruther Wester correspondingly from Scots &quot;wester&quot; (&#x27;western&#x27;).

Anstruther-Easter and Anstruther-Wester are separated by a small stream called Dreel Burn.

Local tradition states that early in the 12th century, Alexander I of Scotland granted the lands of Anstruther to a William de Candela. However, no records survive of this original grant, and the earliest recorded lord of Anstruther was mentioned in a charter of 1225. There have been several theories as to the origin of the, possibly mythical, William, but recent research has suggested he may have been a Norman from Italy. There is evidence that William the Conqueror sought assistance from William, Count of Candela. He sent his son (or possibly his grandson). It may be this was the William de Candela, who received the grant of land from Alexander. William de Candela&#x27;s son, another William, was said to be a benefactor to the monks of Balmerino Abbey. Balmerino was founded in 1229, long after the likely lifetime of this William. Land in Anstruther Easter, on which a chapel was built and now occupied by the Scottish Fisheries Museum, was gifted to Balmerino by another William, sometime in the 1280s. Both this suggestion, and the Italian origin theory are inaccurate. The de Candela family actually came from Dorset, coming to England probably from Normandy in or around 1066. The de Candela name was dropped by a later generation, in a charter confirming a grant of land to Dryburgh Abbey in 1225, Henry is described as &#x27;Henricus de Aynstrother dominus ejusdem&#x27;. His son, also called Henry, was a companion of Louis IX in his crusades to the Holy Land and also swore fealty to Edward I in 1292 and again in 1296.

In 1225, it took the intervention of Pope Honorius III to settle a teinds dispute between the monks of Dryburgh Abbey and the fishermen of Anstruther, suggesting that the fishing was sufficiently good to warrant arguing over. In December 1583, James VI of Scotland gave the town the status of a Royal Burgh and trading rights, recognizing the importance of the port, called the &quot;draucht of Anstruther&quot;. The bounds of the new Burgh were the &quot;Silver Dyke&quot; on the east, the low water line on the south, the Anstruther burn to the west, and the Kylrynnie march road.

James Melville&#x27;s diary provides a graphic account of the arrival of a ship from the Spanish Armada to Anstruther. Local tradition has long held that some of the survivors remained and intermarried with the locals. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the town was home to The Beggar&#x27;s Benison, a gentleman&#x27;s club devoted to &quot;the convivial celebration of male sexuality&quot;.

By the 19th century, Anstruther-Easter, Anstruther-Wester, and Kilrenny were all separate royal and parliamentary boroughs. Anstruther-Easter held tanning, shipbuilding, and fish-curing establishments, as well as a coasting trade. In 1871, the royal burgh of Anstruther-Easter had a population of 1169; the parliamentary burgh, 1289. Anstruther-Wester held 484. The Board of Fisheries constructed a new harbour in the 1870s, completed by 1877 at a cost of £80,000. By the First World War, the communities were connected to St Andrews by the North British Railway.

The Dreel Halls complex incorporates the former Anstruther Wester Town Hall, which dates from 1795, while Anstruther Easter Town Hall was completed in 1872.

Herring fishing remained a feature of the area until the mid-20th century when, after a record catch in 1936, the shoals mysteriously declined until the industry effectively disappeared by 1947. At one time, the town was well served by trains on the Fife Coast Railway. The line was closed to passengers in 1965.

In the summer of 2018 a decision by Fife Council to build a new care home facility on the town&#x27;s Bankie Park was reversed after a campaign by residents.

==Twinning==
Anstruther has been twinned with Bapaume, France since October 1991.

==Bus services==
Stagecoach East Scotland operates two primary bus services which run via Anstruther. These are:
* 95 from Leven to St Andrews via Pittenweem and Crail
* X60 from Edinburgh to St Andrews via Kirkcaldy, Leven and Pittenweem

==Notable inhabitants==
* James Anstruther (d. 1606) was a laird of Anstruther and a courtier, and his son Robert Anstruther was a diplomat during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Sir James Lumsden, a soldier of fortune under Gustavus Adolphus was born in the parish of Kilrenny about 1598.
* William Tennant&#x27;s poem &quot;Anster Fair&quot; concerns the town&#x27;s celebration.
* Thomas Chalmers, co-founder of the Free Church of Scotland, was born and raised in Anstruther-Easter, where his house has been preserved.
* The Goodsir brothers were born and brought up in Anstruther. They were John Goodsir (1814–1867), the anatomist; Harry Goodsir, surgeon on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, Robert Anstruther Goodsir who travelled to the Arctic searching for him, and Joseph Taylor Goodsir, who became a minister and theologian.
* David Martin (1737–1798), the painter and engraver was a native of Anstruther. 
* Author Jessie Kerr Lawson (1838–1917) lived for a time in the town, and her sons Andrew Cowper Lawson (1861–1952), geologist, and James Kerr Lawson (1862–1939), painter, were born there. Andrew discovered and named the San Andreas Fault and the mineral Lawsonite is named after him. The family emigrated to Canada where another son, Abercrombie Anstruther Lawson (1870–1927), founding professor of botany at the University of Sydney, was born.
* Princess Titaua Marama, Chiefess of Haapiti in Polynesia lived in Anstruther from 1892 until she died there in 1898, aged 55. A blue plaque marks the house in which she lived. A book has been written about her life by the British-American author, Fiona J Mackintosh.
* Archibald Constable, Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s publisher, was born in the parish of Carnbee, about three miles to the north of Pittenweem.
* Sir Robert Hamilton Bruce Lockhart (1887–1970), director-general of the Political Warfare Executive during World War II, was also born in Anstruther.
* Belle Patrick (1895–1972), missionary was born in the town.
* Sports writer Graham Spiers hails from Anstruther. 
* It was the childhood home of BBC Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman.

==Politics==
Traditionally, the two Anstruthers returned a single Member of Parliament (MP) together with Kilrenny, Pittenweem, St Andrews, Cupar and Crail.

Currently, Anstruther is in the North East Fife UK Parliament constituency. The sitting member is Wendy Chamberlain of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. In the 2017 General Election, then-MP Stephen Gethins of the SNP retained his seat by a majority of only two votes, narrowly defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate Elizabeth Riches, a resident of Anstruther and former local councillor, after three recounts.

Anstruther is in the North East Fife Scottish Parliament constituency. The MSP is currently Willie Rennie, who won back the seat for the Liberal Democrats from Roderick Campbell of the SNP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election and retained it in 2021. For the purposes of the additional member system used to elect MSPs to the Scottish Parliament, Anstruther is in the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. In local politics, the ward of East Neuk and Landward (of which Anstruther is part) elects three councillors to Fife Council under the single transferable vote system.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, Anstruther was part of the Scotland European Parliament constituency.

<doc id="1137427" wikidata="Q761816" url="?curid=1137427" title="San Juan Bautista (ship)">
<text>San Juan Bautista (&quot;St. John the Baptist&quot;) was one of Japan&#x27;s first Japanese-built Western-style sailing ships. She crossed the Pacific in 1614. She was of the Spanish galleon type, known in Japan as nanban-sen (南蛮船, &quot;Southern Barbarian ships&quot;).

She transported a Japanese diplomatic mission of 180 people during the first leg of their trip to the Vatican as envoys to Pope Paul V, headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga and accompanied by the Spanish friar Luis Sotelo. After transporting Hasekura to Acapulco in the Spanish possession of New Spain, the ship returned to Japan. Hasekura and the embassy went on to Europe, eventually reaching Rome.

==Construction==
&quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; was built in 1613 by Date Masamune, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Sendai in northern Japan, in Tsuki-No-Ura harbour (Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture). The project had been approved by the Bakufu, the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s government in Edo.

The &quot;shōgun&quot; already had two smaller ships (80 and 120 tons) built for him by the English pilot William Adams. The larger, the &quot;San Buena Ventura&quot;, was given to Spanish shipwrecked sailors to return to New Spain in 1610. The &quot;shōgun&quot; also issued numerous permits for Red seal ships, destined for Asian trade and incorporating many elements of Western ship design.

&quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; is reported to have required 45 days&#x27; work, with the participation of technical experts from the Bakufu, 800 shipwrights, 700 smiths, and 3000 carpenters. Two Spanish men also participated to the endeavour: the friar Luis Sotelo, and the Spanish captain Sebastián Vizcaíno.

These efforts were seen with disapproval by the Spanish government in Manila, and Los Rios Coronel suggested that Luis Sotelo should not be allowed into Japan any further (C. R. Boxer).

==Two trans-Pacific round-trips==


Upon completion, the ship left on October 28, 1613, for Acapulco in New Spain, with around 180 people on board, consisting of 10 samurai of the &quot;shōgun&quot; (led by the Minister of the Navy Mukai Shōgen Tadakatsu), 12 samurai from Sendai, 120 Japanese merchants, sailors, and servants, and around 40 Spaniards and Portuguese. The ship arrived in Acapulco on January 25, 1614, after three months at sea.

After a year in Acapulco, the ship returned to Japan on April 28, 1615, as Hasekura continued to Europe. It seems that around 50 specialists in mining and silver-refining were invited to Japan on this occasion, so that they could help develop the mining industry in the Sendai area. A group of Franciscans led by Father Diego de Santa Catalina, sent as a religious embassy to Tokugawa Ieyasu also sailed on the ship. The &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; arrived in Uraga, Japan on August 15, 1615.

In September 1616 the &quot;San Juan Batista&quot; headed again to Acapulco, at the request of Luis Sotelo. She was sailed by Captain Yokozawa Shōgen, but the trip went wrong and around 100 sailors died en route. &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; finally arrived in Acapulco in May 1617. Sotelo and Hasekura met in Mexico for the return trip back to Japan. In April 1618 the ship arrived in the Philippines, where she was sold to the Spanish government there with the objective of building up defenses against the Dutch. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620.

During his absence Japan had changed quite drastically: Christianity was being eradicated, and Japan was moving towards a period of seclusion. Because of these persecutions, the trade agreements with New Spain he had been trying to establish were also denied. In the end, his efforts seem to have had few results, and he died two years later of illness.
==1993 replica ship==

A new &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; was reconstructed in 1993 on the basis of the records of the House of Date. Although its blueprints have not been found, the ship&#x27;s dimensions were recorded properly, permitting a speculative reconstitution. The ship is currently on display in a theme park in Ishinomaki, in northern Japan, close to the location where she was originally built. The replica survived the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami with some damage, and there were hopes in 2011 of using the ship as a symbol of the town&#x27;s reconstruction.

In November 2013 the repaired &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; was rededicated. Assistance had come from a British Columbia lumber company who supplied the massive logs to create masts that had been damaged in the tsunami. However, the replica ship was deemed to be unsafe to the public due to structural damage from floodwater and other factors, and the Miyagi prefectural government decided to demolish the ship rather than to continue repairing it. Dismantling began in November 2021. The government plans to build a new ship in its place, using fibre-reinforced plastic and reducing the size to one quarter of the original.

<doc id="1137430" wikidata="Q6745045" url="?curid=1137430" title="Malvern, Toronto">
<text>Malvern is a neighbourhood in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with a population of 44,315. It is located in the northeast corner of the city.

There are over 60 different cultures represented in Malvern, with the most dominant ethnic groups being Caribbean Canadians (mostly Jamaican, Trinidadian, and Guyanese) and South Asian Canadians (mostly Sri Lankan Tamil, Indian, and Pakistani). The neighbourhood has the highest concentration of young people in Canada.

==History==
The history of Malvern began in 1856, when the Malvern Post Office was opened in David Brown&#x27;s general store, which stood at the south-east corner of Finch Avenue and Markham Road. This post office was named after a resort town in England. A year after the post office was opened, Senator David Reesor — formerly of Markham Village — began selling &quot;Village Lots&quot; in Malvern. Reesor trumpeted Malvern as the future &quot;Capital of Scarborough,&quot; anticipating that the Grand Trunk Railway would extend a branch line through here. However, when the Grand Trunk Railway began service to this area in 1871, it bypassed Malvern in favour of the neighbouring village of Agincourt. The village centre and post office had by that time moved south to the corner of today&#x27;s Sheppard Avenue and Markham Road, which was named Malcolm&#x27;s Corners at the time. The Malvern Primitive Methodist Church (from 1884 Malvern Methodist and 1925 Malvern United Church) on the east side of Markham Road north of Sheppard, discontinued services in 1969 but the graves in the cemetery remain today in the care of the Toronto United Church Council. The congregation, reorganized and renamed Malvern Emmanuel United Church, was relocated to 25 Sewells Road in the 1980s, until it closed in 2020, and the building razed in January 2021. 

While Malvern never did become a prosperous railway centre, it flourished as a farming community for over one hundred years. In the late 1950s, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation expropriated Malvern&#x27;s farms to build a &quot;model community&quot; of affordable homes. The first residents of this modern day Malvern community moved into their homes in 1972.

The Malvern community has attempted to improve following &quot;Project Impact&quot;, in which hundreds of police officers from the Greater Toronto Area cracked down on known associates of the &quot;Malvern Crew&quot; street gang, in early morning raids across the city on May 12, 2004. During the raids, 71 warrants were executed resulting in the arrest of 65 people. Further raids, and the implementation of &quot;Project Pathfinder&quot; would result in arrests of the Malvern Crew&#x27;s rival gang, the &quot;Galloway Boys&quot;, in West Hill.

In the early 21st century, the area saw public investment in the community, including a major renovation of the Malvern Branch of the Toronto Public Library, the construction of new housing developments, the opening of a new park in 2004, and the opening of the Nike Malvern Sports Complex in 2006. The Toronto Zoo, Rouge River, and Rouge Valley Park are also located in the vicinity of Malvern, as was Mammoth Hall, a wooden structure that was once a municipal office, meeting hall and curling rink. The Malvern Community Coalition serves as an active incorporated, non-profit, grassroots community organization which exists to promote and enhance the Malvern Community by engaging, empowering, and connecting community, organizations and institutions.

==Education==

Two public school boards operate schools in Malvern, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB).

Both TCDSB and TDSB operate one public secondary school in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates St. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy, while TDSB operates Lester B. Pearson Collegiate Institute. In addition to secondary schools, both school boards operate several public elementary schools in the Malvern. They include:

* Alexander Stirling Public School (TDSB)
* Berner Trail Junior Public School (TDSB)
* Burrows Hall Junior Public School (TDSB)
* Dr. Marion Hilliard Senior Public School (TDSB)
* Emily Carr Public School (TDSB)
* Fleming Public School (TDSB)
* Grey Owl Junior Public School (TDSB)
* Heritage Park Public School (TDSB)
* Lucy Maud Montgomery Public School (TDSB)
* Malvern Junior Public School (TDSB)
* Mary Shadd Public School (TDSB)
* Sacred Heart Catholic School (TCDSB)
* St. Barnabas Catholic School (TCDSB)
* St. Bede Catholic School (TCDSB)
* St. Columba Catholic School (TCDSB)
* St. Florence Catholic School (TCDSB)
* St. Gabriel Lalemant Catholic School (TCDSB)
* Tom Longboat Junior Public School (TDSB)
The French-first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Malvern, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood, with CSCM/CSV students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

The former S.S. #3 Schoolhouse, serving the Malvern area, built in 1872 stood on of land purchased from George Pearson, is still standing today at 5810 Finch Avenue East. The building is presently used by a private school, Whitefield Christian Academy.

==Transportation==
Several major roadways are located in Malvern. The neighbourhood is bounded to the south by Highway 401 is a major east-west controlled access highway that passes through Greater Toronto. Several other major roadways include Morningside Avenue and Sheppard Avenue. Located on Sewells Road, the Sewells Road Bridge is a bridge over the Rouge River, in the northeast of Malvern.

===Public transit===
Malvern is served by several Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus routes (39 Finch East, 85 Sheppard East, 102 Markham Rd, 116 Morningside, 131 Nugget, 132 Milner, 133 Neilson, 134 Progress, 902 Markham Rd Express, 939C Finch Express, and 985B Sheppard East Express). In the 1980s, there was a plan to bring rapid transit to Malvern by extending the Scarborough line, but lack of government funding prevented any extension of the line. In August 2006, city councillors representing Scarborough rallied for the expansion of the Scarborough line, or its possible light rail replacement, to the Malvern community.

====Scarborough line extension to Malvern====
Back in 2012, the TTC considered extending the RT from McCowan to Malvern Town Centre. They have also made a motion that the current study should include the addition of a station where the existing line crosses Brimley Road. The proposal is moot now as Line 3 Scarborough RT is scheduled to be torn down and replaced by the extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth.

In 2006, a study was completed on the prospects of this line. It recommended upgrading the line to handle larger ART Mark II vehicles, at a cost of $360 million (2006 dollars). Extending the Bloor–Danforth line (either along the current Scarborough RT route, or along a different alignment directly to Scarborough Centre) was not considered cost-effective or justifiable.

On June 15, 2007, the Ontario government had released MoveOntario 2020, a plan that would fund 52 different transit projects throughout Toronto and Hamilton for the cost of $17.5 billion, including the Scarborough RT extension to Sheppard Avenue, which would meet the proposed Sheppard East LRT line, also to be funded by MoveOntario 2020. Unfortunately, in a 2010 budget release, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty had chosen to postpone necessary funding for the project.

With the construction of Line 5 Eglinton nearing its end, there have been discussions and studies about either extending this LRT line or constructing a brand new LRT line to Malvern via University of Toronto Scarborough Campus. In May 2023, the city decided to plan a stand-alone light-rail line running from Kennedy station to Malvern via Eglinton Avenue, Kingston Road, Morningside Avenue and Sheppard Avenue. The new line, dubbed the Eglinton East LRT, would mostly follow the route of the previously proposed but cancelled Scarborough Malvern LRT.
====Scarborough Malvern LRT====
The Scarborough Malvern LRT line, part of the TTC&#x27;s Transit City plan, would run for 15 km, estimated to account for 14 million trips in 2021. The southern terminus of the line would be built at Kennedy Station at Kennedy Road and Eglinton Avenue, with a connection to the Bloor-Danforth subway, the Scarborough RT, and the Eglinton Crosstown LRT line. The whole line would be built within Scarborough. The line would run along Eglinton Avenue East until it reaches Kingston Road, then continues northeast until Morningside Avenue is reached, then continues north until Sheppard Avenue East, where it turns west, sharing the same tracks and stops as in the Sheppard East LRT line. Finally, the line turns north at Neilson Road, terminating at Malvern Town Centre.

Newly elected Rob Ford cancelled the Malvern LRT shortly after he came to office in 2010.
The Malvern LRT would cross the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus.
According to &quot;The Varsity&quot;, the paper for students at the University of Toronto, when students at the Scarborough campus were asked to contribute $30 million towards the construction of an Olympic class pool on their campus, which would first be used for competitions during the 2015 Pan American Games, they were promised two LRT lines would be brought to campus. &quot;The Varsity&quot; reported that the students had held up their part of the bargain and resented that the city dropped plans to build the LRT lines.

In May 2023, the city decided to resurrect the Scarborough Malvern LRT proposal but renaming it the Eglinton East LRT.

==== Sheppard East RT ====
Metrolinx is looking into an extension of Line 4 Sheppard to Meadowvale Road along Sheppard Avenue East. This extension would run through southern Malvern. 

==Economy==

===Malvern Town Centre===
Although Scarborough Town Centre is a short drive away, Malvern Town Centre provides some retail options and amenities to local residents. Built in the late 1980s, the mall&#x27;s primary tenants are Freshland Supermarket, an Asian grocery store; Planet Fitness; and Labels, a discount clothing store. There are plans in the works to redevelop the mall and replace it with residential condo towers and green space. The proposed plan would include a new 16,616 square-metre public park immediately abutting the existing forested area. 

==Demographics==
In 2016, the Malvern neighbourhood was home to 43,794 residents. 51% of the population spoke English as their first language, 12.5% spoke Tamil, 6% spoke Tagalog, 5% spoke Urdu, 3.9% spoke Cantonese and 3.6% spoke Gujarati.

<text>In the philosophy of science and some other branches of philosophy, a &quot;natural kind&quot; is an intellectual grouping, or categorizing of things, that is reflective of the actual world and not just human interests. Some treat it as a classification identifying some structure of truth and reality that exists whether or not humans recognize it. Others treat it as intrinsically useful to the human mind, but not necessarily reflective of something more objective. Candidate examples of natural kinds are found in all the sciences, but the field of chemistry provides the paradigm example of elements. Alexander Bird and Emma Tobin see natural kinds as relevant to metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of language, as well as the philosophy of science.

John Dewey held a view that belief in unconditional natural kinds is a mistake, a relic of obsolete scientific practices. Hilary Putnam rejects descriptivist approaches to natural kinds with semantic reasoning. Hasok Chang and Rasmus Winther hold the emerging view that natural kinds are useful and evolving scientific facts.

==John Dewey==
In 1938, John Dewey published &quot;Logic: The Theory of Inquiry&quot;, where he explained how modern scientists create kinds through induction and deduction, and why they have no use for natural kinds.
:The philosophical issue is how humans can dependably predict that unobserved examples of a kind will have the same traits as a few observed examples. The traditional answer grew out of Aristotle&#x27;s assertion that humans describe things they know in two kinds of propositions. Existential kinds—known by observing traits—are stated in &quot;generic&quot; propositions. Conceptual kinds—known by intuitive recognition of groups of traits—are stated in &quot;universal&quot; propositions.

Dewey argued that modern scientists do not follow Aristotle in treating inductive and deductive propositions as facts already known about nature&#x27;s stable structure. Today, scientific propositions are intermediate steps in inquiry, hypotheses about processes displaying stable patterns. Aristotle&#x27;s generic and universal propositions have become conceptual tools of inquiry warranted by inductive inclusion and exclusion of traits. They are provisional means rather than results of inquiry revealing the structure of reality.
:    Propositions as such are ... provisional, intermediate and instrumental. Since their subject-matter concerns two kinds of means, material and procedural, they are of two main categories: (1) Existential [generic means, known by induction], referring directly to actual conditions, as determined by experimental observation, and (2) ideational or conceptual [universal means, known by deduction], consisting of interrelated meanings, which are non-existential in content ... but which are applicable to existence through the operations they represent as possibilities.

Modern induction starts with a question to be answered or a problem to be solved. It identifies problematic subject-matter and seeks potentially relevant traits and conditions. Generic existential data thus identified are reformulated—stated abstractly as if-then universal relations capable of serving as answers or solutions: If formula_1, then water. For Dewey, induction creates warranted kinds by observing constant conjunction of relevant traits.

:    No grounded generic propositions can be formed save as they are the products of the performance of operations indicated as possible by universal propositions. The problem of inference is, accordingly, to discriminate and conjoin those qualities [kinds] of existential material that serve as distinguishing traits (inclusively and exclusively) of a determinate kind.

Dewey used the example of &quot;morning dew&quot; to describe these abstract steps creating scientific kinds. From antiquity, the common-sense belief had been that all dew is a kind of rain, meaning dew drops fall. By the early 1800s the curious absence of rain before dew and the growth of understanding led scientists to examine new traits. Functional processes changing bodies [kinds] from solid to liquid to gas at different temperatures, and operational constants of conduction and radiation, led to new inductive hypotheses &quot;directly suggested by &quot;this&quot; subject-matter, not by any data [kinds] previously observable. ... There were certain [existential] conditions postulated in the content of the new [non-existential] conception about dew, and it had to be determined whether these conditions were satisfied in the &quot;observable&quot; facts of the case.&quot;

After demonstrating that dew could be formed by these generic existential phenomena, and not by other phenomena, the universal hypothesis arose that dew forms following established laws of temperature and pressure. &quot;The outstanding conclusion is that inductive procedures are those which &quot;prepare&quot; existential material so that it has convincing evidential weight with respect to an inferred generalization. Existential data are not pre-known natural kinds, but become conceptual statements of &quot;natural&quot; processes.
:    Objects and qualities [kinds] as they naturally present themselves or as they are &quot;given,&quot; are not only not the data of science but constitute the most direct and important obstacles to formation of those ideas and hypotheses that are genuinely relevant and effective.
:    We are brought to the conclusion that it is modes of &quot;active response&quot; which are the ground of generality of logical form, not the existential immediate qualities of that which is responded to.

Dewey concluded that nature is not a collection of natural kinds, but rather of reliable processes discoverable by competent induction and deduction. He replaced the ambiguous label &quot;natural kind&quot; with &quot;warranted assertion&quot; to emphasize the conditional nature of all human knowings. Assuming kinds to be given unconditional knowings leads to the error of assuming that conceptual universal propositions can serve as evidence for generic propositions; observed consequences affirm unobservable imagined causes. &quot;For an &#x27;inference&#x27; that is not &quot;grounded&quot; in the evidential nature of the material from which it is drawn is &quot;not&quot; an inference. It is a more or less wild guess.&quot; Modern induction is not a guess about natural kinds, but a means to create instrumental understanding.

==Willard Van Orman Quine==
In 1969, Willard Van Orman Quine brought the term &quot;natural kind&quot; into contemporary analytic philosophy with an essay bearing that title. His opening paragraph laid out his approach in three parts. First, it questioned the logical and scientific legitimacy of reasoning inductively by counting a few examples posting traits imputed to all members of a kind: &quot;What tends to confirm an induction?&quot; For Quine, induction reveals warranted kinds by repeated observation of visible similarities.
Second, it assumed that color can be a characteristic trait of natural kinds, despite some logical puzzles: hypothetical colored kinds such as non-black non-ravens and green-blue emeralds. Finally, it suggested that human psychological structure can explain the illogical success of induction: &quot;an innate flair that we have for natural kinds&quot;.

He started with the logical hypothesis that, if all ravens are black—an observable natural kind—then non-black non-ravens are equally a natural kind: &quot;... each [observed] black raven tends to confirm the law [universal proposition] that all ravens are black ...&quot; Observing shared generic traits warrants the inductive universal prediction that future experience will confirm the sharing: &quot;And every reasonable [universal] expectation depends on resemblance of [generic] circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.&quot; &quot;The notion of a kind and the notion of similarity or resemblance seem to be variants or adaptations of a single [universal] notion. Similarity is immediately definable in terms of kind; for things are similar when they are two of a kind.&quot;

Quine posited an intuitive human capacity to recognize criteria for judging degrees of similarity among objects, an &quot;innate flair for natural kinds”. These criteria work instrumentally when applied inductively: &quot;... why does our innate subjective spacing [classification] of [existential] qualities accord so well with the functionally relevant [universal] groupings in nature as to make our inductions tend to come out right?&quot;

He admitted that generalizing after observing a few similarities is scientifically and logically unjustified. The numbers and degrees of similarities and differences humans experience are infinite. But the method is justified by its instrumental success in revealing natural kinds. The &quot;problem of induction&quot; is how humans &quot;should stand better than random or coin-tossing chances of coming out right when we predict by inductions which are based on our innate, scientifically unjustified similarity standards.&quot;
:    A standard of similarity is in some sense innate. This point is not against empiricism; it is a commonplace of behavioral psychology. A response to a red circle, if it is rewarded, will be elicited by a pink eclipse more readily than by a blue triangle; the red circle resembles the pink ellipse more than the blue triangle. Without some such prior spacing of qualities, we could never acquire a [classification] habit; all stimuli would be equally alike and equally different.

Quine credited human ability to recognize colors as natural kinds to the evolutionary function of color in human survival—distinguishing safe from poisonous kinds of food. He recognized that modern science often judges color similarities to be superficial, but denied that equating existential similarities with abstract universal similarities makes natural kinds any less permanent and important. The human brain&#x27;s capacity to recognize abstract kinds joins the brain&#x27;s capacity to recognize existential similarities.
:    Credit is due to man&#x27;s inveterate ingenuity, or human sapience, for having worked around the blinding dazzle of color vision and found the more significant regularities elsewhere. Evidently natural selection has dealt with the conflict [between visible and invisible similarities] by endowing man doubly: with both a color-slanted quality space and the ingenuity to rise above it.&lt;br&gt;    He has risen above it by developing modified systems of kinds, hence modified similarity standards for scientific purposes. By the [inductive] trial-and-error process of theorizing he has regrouped things into new kinds which prove to lend themselves to many inductions better than the old.
:    A man&#x27;s judgments of similarity do and should depend on his theory [universal propositions], on his beliefs; but similarity itself, what the man&#x27;s judgments purport to be judgments of, [is] an objective relation in the world. It belongs in the [generic] subject matter not of our [universal] theory ... about the world, but of our [universal] theory of the [generic] world itself. Such would be the acceptable and reputable sort of similarity concept, if it could be defined.

Quine argued that the success of innate and learned criteria for classifying kinds on the basis of similarities observed in small samples of kinds, constitutes evidence of the existence of natural kinds; observed consequences affirm imagined causes. His reasoning continues to provoke philosophical debates.

== Hilary Putnam ==
In 1975, Hilary Putnam rejected descriptivist ideas about natural kind by elaborating on semantic concepts in language. Putnam explains his rejection of descriptivist and traditionalist approaches to natural kinds with semantic reasoning, and insists that natural kinds can not be thought of via descriptive processes or creating endless lists of properties.

In Putnam&#x27;s Twin Earth thought experiment, one is asked to consider the extension of &quot;water&quot; when confronted with an alternate version of &quot;water&quot; on an imagined &quot;Twin Earth&quot;. This &quot;water&quot; is composed of chemical XYZ, as opposed to H2O. However, in all other describable aspects, it is the same as Earth’s &quot;water.&quot; Putnam argues that the mere descriptions of an object, such as &quot;water&quot;, is insufficient in defining natural kind. There are underlying aspects, such as chemical composition, that may go unaccounted for unless experts are consulted. This information provided by experts is what Putnam argues will ultimately define natural kinds.

Putnam calls the essential information used to define natural kind &quot;core facts.&quot; This discussion arises in part in response to what he refers to as &quot;Quine’s pessimism&quot; of theory of meaning. Putnam claims that a natural kind can be referred to via its associated stereotype. This stereotype must be a normal member of the category, and is itself defined by core facts as determined by experts. By conveying these core facts, the essential and appropriate use of natural kind terms can be conveyed.

The process of conveying core facts to communicate the essence and appropriate term of a natural kind term is shown in Putnam&#x27;s example of describing a lemon and a tiger. With a lemon, it is possible to communicate the stimulus-meaning of what a lemon is by simply showing someone a lemon. In the case of a tiger, on the other hand, it is considerably more complicated to show someone a tiger, but a speaker can just as readily explain what a tiger is by communicating its core facts. By conveying the core facts of a tiger (e.g. big cat, four legs, orange, black stripes, etc.), the listener can, in theory, go on to use the word &quot;tiger&quot; correctly and refer to its extension accurately.

==Hilary Kornblith==
In 1993, Hilary Kornblith published a review of debates about natural kinds since Quine had launched that epistemological project a quarter-century earlier. He evaluated Quine&#x27;s &quot;picture of natural knowledge&quot; as natural kinds, along with subsequent refinements.

He found still acceptable Quine&#x27;s original assumption that discovering knowledge of mind-independent reality depends on inductive generalisations based on limited observations, despite its being illogical. Equally acceptable was Quine&#x27;s further assumption that instrumental success of inductive reasoning confirms both the existence of natural kinds and the legitimacy of the method.
:    I argue that natural kinds make inductive knowledge of the world possible because the clustering of properties characteristic of natural kinds makes inferences from the presence of some of these properties to the presence of others reliable. Were it not for the existence of natural kinds and the causal structure they require, any attempt to infer the existence of some properties from the presence of others would be no more than quixotic; reliable inductive inference would be impossible. The [generic] causal structure of the world as exhibited in [universal] natural kinds thus provides the natural ground of inductive inference.

Quine&#x27;s assumption of an innate human psychological process—&quot;standard of similarity,&quot; &quot;subjective spacing of qualities&quot;—also remained unquestioned. Kornbluth strengthened this assumption with new labels for the necessary cognitive qualities: &quot;native processes of belief acquisition,&quot; &quot;the structure of human conceptual representation,&quot; &quot;native inferential processes,&quot; &quot;reasonably accurate detectors of covariation.&quot; &quot;To my mind, the primary case to be made for the view that our [universal] psychological processes dovetail with the [generic] causal structure of the world comes ... from the success of science.

Kornblith denied that this logic makes human classifications the same as mind-independent classifications: &quot;The categories of modern science, of course, are not innate.&quot; But he offered no explanation of how kinds that work conditionally can be distinguished from mind-independent unchanging kinds.
:    If the scientific categories of mature sciences did not correspond, at least approximately, to real kinds in nature, but instead merely grouped objects together on the basis of salient observable properties which somehow answer to our interests, it would be utterly miraculous that inductions using these scientific categories tend to issue in accurate predictions. Inductive inference can only work ... if there is something in nature binding together the [generic] properties which we use to identify kinds. ... Unobservables [universal propositions] are then postulated to explain the constant conjunction of observable properties.
:    We approach the world by presupposing that it contains natural kinds. Our inferences depend on this presupposition... This presupposition thus gives us a built-in advantage in understanding what the world is like, and thereby makes inductive understanding of the world a real possibility.
:    When a population [kind] is uniform with respect to some [generic] property, [inductive] inferences from small samples, and indeed, &quot;from a single case&quot;, are perfectly reliable. If I note that a [generic] sample of [universal] copper conducts electricity and straightaway conclude that all copper conducts electricity, then I will do just as well as someone ... checking a very large number of copper samples for their conductivity.

Kornblith didn&#x27;t explain how tedious modern induction accurately generalizes from a few generic traits to all of some universal kind. He attributed such success to individual sensitivity that a single case is representative of all of a kind.
:    If we are sensitive to the situations in which a population is uniform with respect to some property, then making inferences on the basis of very small samples will be a reliable and efficient way to gain information about a population [natural kind].&quot;. He argued that even human infants are intuitively sensitive to natural classifications. :    &quot;From the beginning, children assume that the natural world is divided into kinds on the basis of underlying features which are responsible for their superficial similarities, and that these similarities are an uncertain guide to that real underlying structure.&quot;

Accepting intuition as a legitimate ground for inductive inferences from small samples, Kornblith criticized popular arguments by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman that intuition is irrational. He continued to argue that traditional induction explains the success of modern science.
:    Our [universal] conceptual and inferential tendencies jointly conspire, at least roughly, to carve nature at its [generic] joints and project the features of a kind which are essential to it. This preestablished harmony between the [generic] causal structure of the world and the [universal] conceptual and inferential structure of our minds produces reliable inductive inference.

==Hasok Chang and Rasmus Winther==
Hasok Chang and Rasmus Winther contributed essays to a collection entitled &quot;Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice&quot;, published in 2016. The editor of the collection, Catherine Kendig, argued for a modern meaning of natural kinds, rejecting Aristotelian classifications of objects according to their &quot;essences, laws, sameness relations, fundamental properties ... and how these map out the ontological space of the world.&quot; She thus dropped the traditional supposition that natural kinds exist permanently and independently of human reasoning. She collected original works examining results of discipline-specific classifications of kinds: &quot;the empirical use of natural kinds and what I dub &#x27;activities of natural kinding&#x27; and &#x27;natural kinding practices&#x27;.&quot; Her natural kinds include scientific disciplines themselves, each with its own methods of inquiry and classifications or taxonomies..

Chang&#x27;s contribution displayed Kendig&#x27;s &quot;natural kinding activities&quot; or &quot;practice turn&quot; by reporting classifications in the mature discipline of chemistry—a field renowned for examples of timeless natural kinds: &quot;All water is H2O;&quot; &quot;All gold has atomic number 79.&quot;

He explicitly rejected Quine&#x27;s basic assumption that natural kinds are real generic objects. &quot;When I speak of a (natural) kind in this chapter, I am referring to a [universal] classificatory concept, rather than a collection of objects.&quot; His kinds result from humanity&#x27;s continuous knowledge-seeking activities called science and philosophy. &quot;Putting these notions more unambiguously in terms of concepts rather than objects, I maintain: if we hit upon some stable and effective classificatory concepts in our inquiry, we should cherish them (calling them &#x27;natural kinds&#x27; would be one clear way of doing so), but without presuming that we have thereby found some eternal essences.

He also rejected the position taken by Bird and Tobin in our third quote above. &quot;Alexander Bird and Emma Tobin’s succinct characterization of natural kinds is helpful here, as a foil: ‘to say that a kind is &quot;natural&quot; is to say that it corresponds to a grouping or ordering that does not depend on humans’. My view is precisely the opposite, to the extent that scientific inquiry does depend on humans.&quot;

For Chang, induction creates conditionally warranted kinds by &quot;epistemic iteration&quot;—refining classifications developmentally to reveal how constant conjunctions of relevant traits work: &quot;fundamental classificatory concepts become refined and corrected through our practical scientific engagement with nature. Any considerable and lasting [instrumental] success of such engagement generates confidence in the classificatory concepts used in it, and invites us to consider them as &#x27;natural&#x27;.&quot;

Among other examples, Chang reported the inductive iterative process by which chemists gradually redefined the kind &quot;element&quot;. The original hypothesis was that anything that cannot be decomposed by fire or acids is an element. Learning that some chemical reactions are reversible led to the discovery of weight as a constant through reactions. And then it was discovered that some reactions involve definite and invariable weight ratios, refining understanding of constant traits. &quot;Attempts to establish and explain the combining-weight regularities led to the development of the chemical atomic theory by John Dalton and others. ... Chemical elements were later redefined in terms of atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus).&quot;

Chang claimed his examples of classification practices in chemistry confirmed the fallacy of the traditional assumption that natural kinds exist as mind-independent reality. He attributed this belief more to imagining supernatural intervention in the world, than to illogical induction. He did not consider the popular belief that innate psychological capacities enable traditional induction to work. &quot;Much natural-kind talk has been driven by an intuitive metaphysical essentialism that concerns itself with an objective [generic] order of nature whose [universal] knowledge could, ironically, only be obtained by a supernatural being. Let us renounce such an unnatural notion of natural kinds. Instead, natural kinds should be conceived as something we humans may succeed in inventing and improving through scientific practice.&quot;

Rasmus Winther&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice&quot; gave new meaning to natural objects and qualities in the nascent discipline of Geographic Information Science (GIS). This &quot;inter-discipline&quot; engages in discovering patterns in—and displaying spatial kinds of—data, using methods that make its results unique natural kinds. But it still creates kinds using induction to identify instrumental traits.

&quot;Collecting and collating geographical data, building geographical data-bases, and engaging in spatial analysis, visualization, and map-making all require organizing, typologizing, and classifying geographic space, objects, relations, and processes. I focus on the use of natural kinds ..., showing how practices of making and using kinds are contextual, fallible, plural, and purposive. The rich family of kinds involved in these activities are here baptized mapping kinds.&quot;

He later identified sub-kinds of mapping kinds as &quot;calibrating kinds,&quot; &quot;feature kinds,&quot; and &quot;object kinds&quot; of &quot;data model types.&quot;

Winther identified &quot;inferential processes of abstraction and generalization&quot; as methods used by GIS, and explained how they generate digital maps. He illustrated two kinds of inquiry procedures, with sub-procedures to organize data. They are reminiscent of Dewey&#x27;s multiple steps in modern inductive and deductive inference. Methods for transforming generic phenomena into kinds involve reducing complexity, amplifying, joining, and separating. Methods for selecting among generic kinds involves elimination, classification, and collapse of data. He argued that these methods for mapping kinds can be practiced in other disciplines, and briefly considered how they might harmonize three conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds.

Some philosophers believe there can be a &quot;pluralism&quot; of kinds and classifications. They prefer to speak of &quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot; kinds rather than eternal &quot;natural&quot; kinds. They may be called social constructivists whose kinds are human products. Chang&#x27;s conclusions that natural kinds are human-created and instrumentally useful would appear to put him in this group.

Other philosophers, including Quine, examine the role of kinds in scientific inference. Winther does not examine Quine&#x27;s commitment to traditional induction generalizing from small samples of similar objects. But he does accept Quine&#x27;s willingness to call human-identified kinds that work natural.

&quot;Quine holds that kinds are &quot;functionally relevant groupings in nature&quot; whose recognition permits our inductions to &quot;tend to come out right.&quot; That is, kinds ground fallible inductive inferences and predictions, so essential to scientific projects including those of GIS and cartography.&quot;

Finally, Winther identified a philosophical perspective seeking to reconstruct rather than reject belief in natural kinds. He placed Dewey in this group, ignoring Dewey&#x27;s rejection of the traditional label in favor of &quot;warranted assertions&quot;.

&quot;Dewey resisted the standard view of natural kinds, inherited from the Greeks ... Instead, Dewey presents an analysis of kinds (and classes and universals) as fallible and context-specific hypotheses permitting us to address problematic situations effectively.&quot;
Winther concludes that classification practices used in Geographic Information Science are able to harmonize these conflicting philosophical perspectives on natural kinds.

&quot;GIS and cartography suggest that kinds are simultaneously discovered [as pre-existing structures] and constructed [as human classifications]. Geographic features, processes, and objects are of course real. Yet we must structure them in our data models and, subsequently, select and transform them in our maps. Realism and (social) constructivism are hence not exclusive in this field.&quot;

<text>Some of the National Treasures of Japan

A is the most precious of Japan&#x27;s Tangible Cultural Properties, as determined and designated by the Agency for Cultural Affairs (a special body of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology). A Tangible Cultural Property is considered to be of historic or artistic value, classified either as &quot;buildings and structures&quot; or as &quot;fine arts and crafts&quot;. Each National Treasure must show outstanding workmanship, a high value for world cultural history, or exceptional value for scholarship.

Approximately 20% of the National Treasures are structures such as castles, Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, or residences. The other 80% are paintings; scrolls; sutras; works of calligraphy; sculptures of wood, bronze, lacquer or stone; crafts such as pottery and lacquerware carvings; metalworks; swords and textiles; and archaeological and historical artifacts. The items span the period of ancient to early modern Japan before the Meiji period, including pieces of the world&#x27;s oldest pottery from the Jōmon period and 19th-century documents and writings. The designation of the Akasaka Palace in 2009, the Tomioka Silk Mill in 2014 and of the Kaichi School added three modern, post-Meiji Restoration, National Treasures.

Japan has a comprehensive network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection is typical of Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, as well as financial support in the form of grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and public display of the properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect the built environment of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works.

Kansai, the region of Japan&#x27;s capitals from ancient times to the 19th century, has the most National Treasures; Kyoto alone has about one in five National Treasures. Fine arts and crafts properties are generally owned privately or are in museums, including national museums such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Nara, public prefectural and city museums, and private museums. Religious items are often housed in temples and Shinto shrines or in an adjacent museum or treasure house.
==History==

===Background and early protection efforts===

Japanese cultural properties were originally in the ownership of Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and aristocratic or samurai families. Feudal Japan ended abruptly in 1867–68 when the Tokugawa shogunate was replaced by the Meiji Restoration. During the ensuing &quot;haibutsu kishaku&quot; (&quot;abolish Buddhism and destroy Shākyamuni&quot;) triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism and anti-Buddhist movements propagating the return to Shinto, Buddhist buildings and artwork were destroyed. In 1871, the government confiscated temple lands, considered symbolic of the ruling elite. Properties belonging to the feudal lords were expropriated, historic castles and residences were destroyed, and an estimated 18,000 temples were closed. During the same period, Japanese cultural heritage was impacted by the rise of industrialization and westernization. As a result, Buddhist and Shinto institutions became impoverished. Temples decayed, and valuable objects were exported.

In 1871, the Daijō-kan issued a decree to protect Japanese antiquities called the . Based on recommendations from the universities, the decree ordered prefectures, temples, and shrines to compile lists of important buildings and art. However, these efforts proved to be ineffective in the face of radical westernisation. In 1880, the government allotted funds for the preservation of ancient shrines and temples. By 1894, 539 shrines and temples had received government funded subsidies to conduct repairs and reconstruction. The five-storied pagoda of Daigo-ji, the &quot;kon-dō&quot; of Tōshōdai-ji, and the &quot;hon-dō&quot; of Kiyomizu-dera are examples of buildings that underwent repairs during this period. A survey conducted in association with Okakura Kakuzō and Ernest Fenollosa between 1888 and 1897 was designed to evaluate and catalogue 210,000 objects of artistic or historic merit. The end of the 19th century was a period of political change in Japan as cultural values moved from the enthusiastic adoption of western ideas to a newly discovered interest in Japanese heritage. Japanese architectural history began to appear on curricula, and the first books on architectural history were published, stimulated by the newly compiled inventories of buildings and art.

===Ancient Temples and Shrines Preservation Law===
On June 5, 1897, the (law number 49) was enacted; it was the first systematic law for the preservation of Japanese historic art and architecture. Formulated under the guidance of architectural historian and architect Itō Chūta, the law established (in 20 articles) government funding for the preservation of buildings and the restoration of artworks. The law applied to architecture and pieces of art relating to an architectural structure, with the proviso that historic uniqueness and exceptional quality were to be established (article 2). Applications for financial support were to be made to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (article 1), and the responsibility for restoration or preservation lay in the hands of local officials (article 3). Restoration works were financed directly from the national coffers (article 3).

A second law was passed on December 15, 1897, that provided supplementary provisions to designate works of art in the possession of temples or shrines as . The new law also provided for pieces of religious architecture to be designated as a . While the main criteria were &quot;artistic superiority&quot; and &quot;value as historical evidence and wealth of historical associations&quot;, the age of the piece was an additional factor. Designated artworks could be from any of the following categories: painting, sculpture, calligraphy, books, and handicrafts. Swords were added later. The law limited protection to items held at religious institutions, while articles in private ownership remained unprotected. Funds designated for the restoration of works of art and structures were increased from 20,000 yen to 150,000 yen, and fines were set for the destruction of cultural properties. Owners were required to register designated objects with newly created museums, which were granted first option of purchase in case of sale. Initially, 44 temple and shrine buildings and 155 relics were designated under the new law, including the &quot;kon-dō&quot; at Hōryū-ji.

The laws of 1897 are the foundation for today&#x27;s preservation law. When they were enacted, only England, France, Greece, and four other European nations had similar legislation. As a result of the new laws, Tōdai-ji&#x27;s &quot;Daibutsuden&quot; was restored beginning in 1906 and finishing in 1913. In 1914, the administration of cultural properties was transferred from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ministry of Education (today MEXT).

===Extension of the protection===
At the beginning of the 20th century, modernization transformed the Japanese landscape and posed a threat to historic and natural monuments. Societies of prominent men such as the &quot;Imperial Ancient Sites Survey Society&quot; or the &quot;Society for the Investigation and Preservation of Historic Sites and Aged Trees&quot; lobbied and achieved a resolution in the House of Peers for conservation measures. Eventually these efforts resulted in the 1919 , protecting and cataloguing such properties in the same manner as temples, shrines, and pieces of art.

By 1929, about 1,100 properties had been designated under the 1897 &quot;Ancient Shrines and Temples Preservation Law&quot;. Most were religious buildings dating from the 7th to early 17th century. Approximately 500 buildings were extensively restored, with 90% of the funding provided by the national budget. Restorations during the Meiji period often employed new materials and techniques.
In 1929 the was passed and went into effect on July 1 of that year. The law replaced the 1897 laws and extended protection for National Treasures held by public and private institutions and private individuals in an effort to prevent the export or removal of cultural properties. The focus of protection was not only for old religious buildings but also for castles, teahouses, residences, and more recently built religious buildings. Many of these structures had been transferred from feudal to private ownership following the Meiji restoration. Some of the first residential buildings to be designated National Treasures were the Yoshimura residence in Osaka (1937) and the Ogawa residence in Kyoto (1944). The designation &quot;National Treasure&quot; was applied to objects of art and to historical buildings. The new law required permits to be obtained for future alterations of designated properties.

The restoration of Tōdai-ji&#x27;s &quot;Nandaimon&quot; gate in 1930 saw improved standards for preservation. An architect supervised the reconstruction works on-site. Extensive restoration reports became the norm, including plans, results of surveys, historical sources, and documentation of the work done. During the 1930s, about 70–75% of restoration costs came from the national budget, which increased even during the war.

In the early 1930s, Japan suffered from the Great Depression. In an effort to prevent art objects not yet designated National Treasures from being exported because of the economic crisis, the was passed on April 1, 1933. It provided a simplified designation procedure with temporary protection, including protections against exportations. About 8,000 objects were protected under the law, including temples, shrines, and residential buildings. By 1939, nine categories of properties consisting of 8,282 items (paintings, sculptures, architecture, documents, books, calligraphy, swords, crafts, and archaeological resources) had been designated as National Treasures and were forbidden to be exported.

During World War II many of the designated buildings were camouflaged, and water tanks and fire walls were installed for protection. Nonetheless, 206 designated buildings, including Hiroshima Castle, were destroyed from May to August 1945. The ninth-century Buddhist text &quot;Tōdaiji Fujumonkō&quot;, designated a National Treasure in 1938, was destroyed by a fire in 1945 as a result of the war.

===Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties===

When the &quot;kon-dō&quot; of Hōryū-ji, one of the oldest extant wooden buildings in the world and the first to be protected under the &quot;Ancient Temples and Shrines Preservation Law&quot;, caught fire on January 26, 1949, valuable seventh-century wall paintings were damaged. The incident accelerated the reorganization of cultural property protection and gave rise to the , which was drafted on May 30, 1950, and went into effect on August 29 of that year.
The new law combined the laws of 1919, 1929, and 1933. The scope of the previous protection laws was expanded to cover &quot;intangible cultural properties&quot; such as performing and applied arts, &quot;folk cultural properties&quot;, and &quot;buried cultural properties&quot;. Before the enactment of this law, only intangible cultural properties of especially high value at risk of extinction had been protected. Even by international standards, a broad spectrum of properties was covered by the 1950 law. The law was the basis for the establishment of the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Properties, a precursor of today&#x27;s Agency for Cultural Affairs. It allowed the selection of the most important cultural properties; set restrictions on the alteration, repair and export of cultural properties; and provided measures for the preservation and utilization of such properties.

The regulations implementing the law specified three broad categories of properties: tangible/intangible cultural properties and &quot;historic sites, places of scenic beauty, and natural monuments&quot;. Tangible cultural properties were defined as objects of &quot;high artistic or historic value&quot; or archaeological materials (or other historic material) of &quot;high scholarly value&quot;. Designated buildings were required to be outstanding in design or building technique, have a high historic or scholarly value, or be typical of a movement or area.

A system for tangible cultural properties was established with two gradings: Important Cultural Property and National Treasure. The minister of education designates important cultural properties as National Treasures if they are of &quot;particularly high value from the standpoint of world culture or outstanding treasures for the Japanese people.&quot; All previously designated National Treasures were initially demoted to Important Cultural Properties. Some have been designated as new National Treasures since June 9, 1951. Following a decision by the National Diet, properties to be nominated as a World Heritage Site are required to be protected under the 1950 law.

===Recent developments in cultural properties protection===
National Treasures have been designated according to the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties starting from June 9, 1951. This law, which is still in force, has since been supplemented with amendments and additional laws that reorganized the system for protection and preservation and extended its scope to a larger variety of cultural properties. Some of these changes indirectly affected the protection of designated National Treasures.
In the 1960s, the spectrum of protected buildings was expanded to include early examples of western architecture. In 1966, the &quot;Law for the Preservation of Ancient Capitals&quot; was passed. It was restricted to the ancient capitals of Kamakura, Heijō-kyō (Nara), Heian-kyō (Kyoto), Asuka, Yamato (present day Asuka, Nara), Fujiwara-kyō (Kashihara), Tenri, Sakurai, and Ikaruga, areas in which a large number of National Treasures exist. In 1975, the law was extended to include groups of historic buildings not necessarily located in capitals.

The second significant change of 1975 was that the government began to extend protection not only to tangible or intangible properties for their direct historic or artistic value but also to the &quot;techniques for the conservation of cultural properties.&quot; This step was necessary because of the lack of skilled craftsmen resulting from industrialization. The techniques to be protected included the mounting of paintings and calligraphy on scrolls; the repair of lacquerware and wooden sculptures; and the production of Noh masks, costumes, and instruments.
The two-tier system of &quot;National Treasures&quot; and &quot;Important Cultural Properties&quot; was supplemented in 1996 with a new level of &quot;Registered Cultural Property&quot; for items in significant need of preservation and use. Initially limited to buildings, the newly established level of importance functioned as a waiting list for nominated Important Cultural Properties and as an extension for National Treasures. A large number of mainly industrial and historic residences from the late Edo to the Shōwa period were registered under this system. Compared to Important Cultural Properties and National Treasures, the registration of Cultural Property entails fewer responsibilities for the owner. Since the end of the 20th century, the Agency for Cultural Affairs has focused on designating structures built between 1868 and 1930 and those in underrepresented regions. The insufficient supply of raw materials and tools necessary for restoration works was recognized by the agency. In 1999, protective authority was transferred to prefectures and designated cities. As a result of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake, 714 cultural properties including five National Treasure buildings suffered damage. The affected National Treasures are Zuigan-ji (Main Hall and Priest&#x27;s Quarters), Ōsaki Hachiman-gū, Shiramizu Amidadō and the Buddha Hall of Seihaku-ji.

==Designation procedure==

Cultural products with a tangible form that possess high historic, artistic, and academic value for Japan are listed in a three-tier system. Properties in need of preservation and use are catalogued as &quot;Registered Cultural Properties&quot;. Important objects are designated as &quot;Important Cultural Properties&quot;.

Important cultural properties that show truly exceptional workmanship, a particularly high value for world cultural history, or an exceptional value to scholarship can be designated as &quot;National Treasures&quot;. In order to achieve the designation, the owner of an important cultural property contacts or is contacted by the Agency for Cultural Affairs for information regarding the registration. In the latter case, the agency always asks the owner for consent beforehand, even though not required by law. The agency then contacts the Council for Cultural Affairs, which consists of five members appointed by the minister of education for their &quot;wide and eminent views on and knowledge of culture.&quot; The council may seek support from an investigative commission and eventually prepares a report to the Agency for Cultural Affairs. If they support the nomination, the property is placed on the registration list of cultural properties, the owner is informed of the outcome, and an announcement is made in the official gazette. The designation policy is deliberately restrained, keeping the number of designated properties low. In this respect the South Korean protective system is similar to that of Japan. In the 21st century, up to nine properties were designated every year.

==Categories==
The Agency for Cultural Affairs designates tangible cultural properties as National Treasures in thirteen categories based on type. The agency generally distinguishes between and . Each main category is divided into subcategories. The 231 structural cultural properties are separated into eight categories, and the 912 fine arts and crafts cultural properties are separated into seven categories.

===Castles===

The category includes nine designated National Treasures located at five sites (Himeji Castle, Matsumoto Castle, Inuyama Castle, Hikone Castle, and Matsue Castle) and comprises eighteen structures such as donjons, watch towers, and connecting galleries. Himeji Castle, the most visited castle in Japan and a World Heritage Site, has five National Treasures; the other castles each have one. The designated structures represent the apogee of Japanese castle construction, and date from the end of the Sengoku period, from the late 16th to the first half of the 17th century. Built of wood and plaster on a stone foundation, the castles were military fortifications as well as political, cultural, and economic centers. They also served as residences for the &quot;daimyō&quot;, his family, and retainers. The oldest structure in the category is a Bunroku-era secondary donjon called the Northwest Small Tower, which is located at Matsumoto Castle.

===Modern and historical residences===

Residential architecture includes two categories: from the Meiji period onward and , which date to before 1867. Presently, the only modern residential National Treasure is the Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, which was built in 1909. Fourteen National Treasures, dating from between 1485 and 1657, are listed in the historical residences category. Ten are located in Kyoto. The structures include teahouses, &quot;shoin&quot;, and guest or reception halls.

===Structures related to industry, transportation and public works===
In 2014, the former Tomioka Silk Mill, Japan&#x27;s oldest modern model silk reeling factory was designated as the only National Treasure in the category of . Established in 1872 by the government, this is—after the Akasaka Palace—the second modern (post-Meiji) structural National Treasure. The designated property includes several buildings such as the silk reeling mill and the East and West cocoon warehouses.

===Schools===
One of Japan&#x27;s oldest schools, the Kaichi School in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture was designated in 2019 as the only National Treasure in the category of . The institution was established shortly after the Meiji Restoration and relocated to the extant western-style building in 1876.

===Shrines===

National Treasures in the category of include main halls (&quot;honden&quot;), oratories (&quot;haiden&quot;), gates, offering halls (&quot;heiden&quot;), purification halls (&quot;haraedono&quot;), and other structures associated with Shinto shrines. Presently there are 43 National Treasures in this category, dating from the 12th century (late Heian period) to the 19th century (late Edo period). According to the tradition of &quot;, the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals, adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day. The oldest designated extant shrine structure is the main hall at Ujigami Shrine, which dates from the 12th century (late Heian period). About half of the designated structures are located in three prefectures: Kyoto, Nara, and Shiga, all of which are in the Kansai region of Japan. Nikkō Tōshō-gū has five National Treasures.

===Temples===

Structures associated with Buddhist temples such as main halls (&quot;butsuden&quot;, &quot;hon-dō&quot; and &quot;kon-dō&quot;), pagodas, belfries, corridors, and other halls or structures are designated in the category . Presently 158 National Treasures have been designated in this category, including two of the oldest wooden structures in the world—from the 6th century, Hōryū-ji and Tōdai-ji&#x27;s &quot;Daibutsuden&quot;, the largest wooden building in the world. The structures cover more than 1,000 years of Japanese Buddhist architecture, from the 6th century (Asuka period) to the 19th century (late Edo period). About three quarters of the designated properties are located in the Kansai region, with 59 National Treasure temple structures in Nara Prefecture and 32 in Kyoto Prefecture. The temple Hōryū-ji has the largest number of designated National Treasure buildings, with 18 structures.

===Miscellaneous structures===
There are five that do not fall into any of the other categories. They are the North Noh stage in Kyoto&#x27;s Nishi Hongan-ji, the auditorium of the former Shizutani School in Bizen, the Roman Catholic Ōura Church in Nagasaki, the Tamaudun royal mausoleum of the Ryukyu Kingdom in Shuri, Okinawa, and the Tsūjun Bridge.

The North Noh stage, dating to 1581, is the oldest extant structure of its kind, consisting of a stage, a , a , and a .

Built during the mid-Edo period in 1701, the Auditorium of the Shizutani school, an educational institute for commoners, is a single-story building. It has a hip-and-gable (&quot;irimoya&quot;) tile roof composed of flat broad concave tiles and semi-cylindrical convex tiles that cover the seams. The structure is built of high-quality woods such as zelkova, cedar, and camphor.

Ōura Church was established in 1864 by the French priest Bernard Petitjean of Fier to commemorate the 26 Christian martyrs executed by crucifixion on February 5, 1597, at Nagasaki. The façade of the church faces Nishizaka hill, the place of their execution. It is a gothic structure and the oldest extant wooden church in Japan.

Built in 1501 by King Shō Shin, the Tamaudun consists of two stone-walled enclosures and three tomb compartments that in compliance with tradition temporarily held the remains of Ryūkyūan royalty.

Tsūjun Bridge is an long arch bridge and aqueduct built in 1854 used for irrigation and representing the highest level of technology at the time.

===Ancient documents===

Valuable Japanese historical documents are designated in the category . There are 63 items or sets of items in this category, ranging from letters and diaries to records. One National Treasure is a linen map, and another is an inscription on stone. However, all other objects in the category were created with a writing brush on paper and in many cases present important examples of early calligraphy. The oldest item dates from the late 7th century and the most recent from the 19th century (late Edo period). Approximately half of the entries in the category are located in Kyoto.

===Archaeological materials===

The category includes some of the oldest cultural properties, with 50 designated National Treasures. Many of the National Treasures in this category consist of large sets of objects originally buried as part of graves or as offering for temple foundations, and subsequently excavated from tombs, kofun, sutra mounds, or other archaeological sites. The oldest items are stone tools from the paleolithic period and flame-shaped pottery and &quot;dogū&quot; clay figurines from the Jōmon period that reflect early Japanese civilization. Other items listed include bronze mirrors and bells, jewellery, ancient swords, and knives. The most recent object, a hexagonal stone column, dates to the Nanboku-chō period, 1361. Most of the materials (31) are located in museums, with six National Treasures in the Tokyo National Museum.

===Crafts===
The category includes 254 National Treasures, of which 122 are swords and 132 are other craft items.

==== Swords ====

Swords are included in the crafts category, and either the sword itself or a sword mounting is designated as a National Treasure. Currently 110 swords and 12 sword mountings are National Treasures. The oldest designated properties date to the seventh century (Asuka period). However, 86 of the items are from the Kamakura period, with the most recent object from the Muromachi period. The designated items are located in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, museums, and private collections.

==== Non-swords ====

The crafts category includes pottery from Japan, China and Korea; metalworks such as mirrors and temple bells; Buddhist ritual items and others; lacquerware such as boxes, furniture, harnesses, and portable shrines; textiles; armor; and other objects. These items date from classical to early modern Japan —and are housed in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and museums. Also included in this category are sacred treasures that worshippers presented to Asuka Shrine, Tsurugaoka Hachimangū, Itsukushima Shrine, Kasuga-taisha, and Kumano Hayatama Taisha. The treasures were dedicated to the enshrined deity of the respective shrine. They comprise garments, household items, and other items.

===Historical materials===

Three National Treasure sets are catalogued in the category . One set consists of 1,251 items related to the Shō family, the kings of Ryūkyū, who ruled over most of the Ryukyu Islands between the 15th and 19th century. The designated items date to the second Shō Dynasty (between the 16th and 19th century), and are located in the Naha City Museum of History. Within this set are 1,166 documents or records, including construction plans or registers of funeral items; 85 are craft items including articles of clothing and furniture.

The second set comprises paintings, documents, ceremonial tools, harnesses, and items of clothing Hasekura Tsunenaga brought back from his 1613 to 1620 trade mission (Keichō Embassy) to Europe. Sent by Date Masamune, Lord of the Sendai Domain, Hasekura traveled via Mexico City and Madrid to Rome before returning to Japan. Located in the Sendai City Museum, the designated set of items consists of 47 objects: a Roman citizenship document dating from November 1615; a portrait of Pope Paul V; a portrait of Hasekura in prayer following his conversion in Madrid; 19 religious paintings; pictures of saints; ceremonial items such as rosaries; a cross and medals; 25 items of harnesses and clothing such as priests&#x27; garments; an Indonesian and Benjamin Tenze kris; and a Ceylonese dagger.

A third set consists of 2,345 Edo period items related to the Japanese surveyor and cartographer Inō Tadataka. The designated objects are in custody of the Inō Tadataka Memorial Hall in Katori, Chiba, and include 787 maps and drawings, 569 documents and records, 398 letters, 528 books, and 63 utensils such as surveying instruments.

===Paintings===

Japanese and Chinese paintings from the 8th-century Classical Nara period to the early modern 19th-century Edo period are listed in the category . The 166 National Treasures in the category include Buddhist themes, landscapes, portraits, and court scenes. Various base materials have been used: 92 are hanging scrolls; 40 are hand scrolls or emakimono; 24 are byōbu folding screens or paintings on sliding doors (fusuma); and three are albums. They are located in museums, Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, private collections, a university, and two tombs (Takamatsuzuka Tomb and Kitora Tomb). A large proportion of items are housed in the national museums of Tokyo, Kyoto, and Nara. The greatest number of National Treasure paintings are located in Kyoto with 51, and Tokyo with 51, and more than half of the Tokyo paintings are located in the Tokyo National Museum.

===Sculptures===

Sculptures of Buddhist and Shintō deities, or of priests venerated as founders of temples, are listed in the category . There are 141 National Treasure sculptures or groups of sculptures from the 7th-century Asuka period to the 13th-century Kamakura period. Most (109) sculptures are wooden, twelve entries in the list are bronze, eleven are lacquer, seven are made of clay, and one entry, the Usuki Stone Buddhas, consists of a group of stone sculptures. The statues vary in size from just to and for the Great Buddhas of Nara and Kamakura. Seventy-seven of the 141 entries are located in Nara Prefecture while another 42 are in Kyoto Prefecture. With few exceptions, the sculptures are located in Buddhist temples. Hōryū-ji and Kōfuku-ji are the locations with the most entries, with 18 and 18 designations respectively. The Okura Museum of Art in Tokyo, the Nara National Museum in Nara and the Yoshino Mikumari Shrine in Yoshino, Nara each have a single National Treasure in the sculpture category; one National Treasure that consists of four sculptures of Shinto gods is located at Kumano Hayatama Taisha; and the Usuki Stone Buddhas belong to Usuki city.

===Writings===

Written materials of various type such as sūtra transcriptions, poetry, historical books, and specialist books are designated in the category . The 235 items or sets of items are National Treasures that date predominantly to classical Japan and the Imperial era of China from the 6th century to the Muromachi period. Most were made with a writing brush on paper and in many cases present important examples of calligraphy.

==Preservation and utilization measures==

To guarantee the preservation and utilization of designated National Treasures, a set of measures was laid down in the &quot;Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties&quot; of 1950. These direct measures are supplemented by indirect efforts aimed at protecting the built environment (in the case of architecture), or techniques necessary for restoration works.

The owners or managers of a National Treasure are responsible for the administration and restoration of the work. Should the property be lost, destroyed, damaged, altered, moved, or ownership be transferred, they must advise the Agency for Cultural affairs. Alterations to the property require a permit, and the agency is to be notified 30 days in advance when repairs are conducted.(§ 43). If requested, owners must supply information, and report to the commissioner of the Agency for Cultural Affairs, regarding the condition of the property (§ 54). If a National Treasure is damaged, the commissioner has the authority to order the owner or custodian to repair the property; if the owner is non-compliant, the commissioner may carry out repairs. If a National Treasure is to be sold, the government retains the first option to buy the item (§ 46). Transfers of National Treasures are generally restrictive, and export is prohibited.

If subsidies were granted to the property, the commissioner has the authority to recommend or order public access or a loan to a museum for a limited period.(§ 51). The requirement that private owners must allow access or cede rights to the property has been considered a reason that the properties under supervision of the Imperial Household Agency have not been designated as a National Treasure, with the exception of the Shōsōin and more recently five artworks from the Museum of the Imperial Collections. The Imperial Household Agency considers that Imperial properties have sufficient protection, and do not require additional protection provided by the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. The government satisfies scientific and public interest in cultural properties by a system of documentation, and through the operation of museums and centres for cultural research.

Protection measures are not limited to the responsibilities of ownership. Apart from the prestige gained through the designation, owners are entitled to advantages such as local tax exemption, including fixed assets tax, special property tax, and city planning tax, as well as reduction of national taxes applied to the transfer of properties.

The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners or custodians with advice and guidance on matters of administration, restoration, and the public display of National Treasures. The agency promotes local activities aimed at the protection of cultural properties, such as activities for the study, protection, or transmission of cultural properties. A custodian can be named for a National Treasure (usually a local governing body) if the following circumstances exist: the owner cannot be located, the property is damaged, adequate protection of the property has not been provided, or public access to the property has not been allowed.

The government provides grants for repairs, maintenance, and the installation of fire prevention facilities and other disaster prevention systems. Subsidies are available to municipalities for purchasing land or cultural property structures. Designated properties generally increase in value.
The budget allocated by the Agency for Cultural Affairs in fiscal 2009 for the &quot;Facilitation of Preservation Projects for National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties&quot; amounted to 12,013 million yen or 11.8% of the total budget of the agency. &quot;Enhancements of Cultural Properties Protection&quot;, including the former contingent, were allocated 62,219 million yen, or 61.0% of the total budget.

==Statistics==
The Agency for Cultural Affairs of Japan publishes the list of National Treasures and other designated Japanese cultural artefacts at the Database of National Cultural Properties. As of March 22, 2024, there are 912 National Treasures in the arts and crafts category, and 232 in the buildings and structures category. The total number of arts and crafts items, as well as the total number of structures, is actually higher because related objects are sometimes grouped under a common name.

About 89% of structural National Treasures are religious in nature. Residences account for 8% of designated buildings; the remaining are castles and miscellaneous structures. More than 90% are wooden buildings, and about 13% of designated buildings are in private ownership. Of &quot;fine arts and crafts&quot; category, more than 30% of National Treasures are written materials such as documents, letters, or books. Swords, paintings, sculptures, and non-sword craft items each account for about 15% of National Treasures in this category.

===Geographical distribution===
The geographical distribution of National Treasures in Japan is highly uneven. Remote areas such as Hokkaido and Kyushu have few designated properties, and most prefectures may only have a couple of National Treasure structures. Two prefectures—Miyazaki and Tokushima—do not have any National Treasures.

Four prefectures in the Kansai region of central Honshū each have more than ten National Treasure structures: Hyōgo (11), Kyoto (52), Nara (64), and Shiga Prefecture (22). Together they comprise 149 or 66% of all structural National Treasures in Japan. Three sites have 92 structural National Treasures: Kyoto, the capital of Japan and the seat of the imperial court for more than 1,000 years; Hōryū-ji, founded by Prince Shōtoku around 600; and Nara, capital of Japan from 710 to 784.

Fine arts and crafts National Treasures are distributed in a similar fashion, with fewer in remote areas, and a higher concentration in the Kansai region. The seven prefectures of the region harbor 499, or 56%, of all arts and crafts National Treasures. Tokyo, which has only two National Treasure buildings, has an exceptionally high number of cultural properties in this category. Of the 217 properties located in Tokyo, 88 are at the Tokyo National Museum.

===Age===
The designated items provide an overview of the history of Japanese art and architecture from ancient to modern times, with the earliest archaeological National Treasures dating back 6,500 years, and the Akasaka Palace dating from the early 20th century. Items from any one of the categories of National Treasures may not represent the entire interval of time, but rather a shorter period of time determined by historical events, and coinciding with the time in which the specific artistry or type of architecture flourished.

Temple National Treasures cover the time from the late 7th century—about 150 years after the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in the mid-6th century—to the 19th century (early modern Japan). The history of Shinto shrines in Japan is even older than that of temples. However, because of the tradition of rebuilding shrines at regular intervals, known as , the oldest designated shrine structures date to the late 12th century. The archetypical Japanese castles are a product of a period of 50 years that began with the construction of Azuchi Castle in 1576, which marked a change in style and function of castles. Castle construction ended in 1620; the Tokugawa shogunate destroyed the Toyotomi clan in 1615 and subsequently prohibited the building of new castles.

Stone tools dated to 13,000–28,000 BC from the Japanese paleolithic reflect the beginning of human habitation in Japan and have been designated as the oldest National Treasures in the &quot;archaeological materials&quot; category.

The first indications of stable living patterns and civilization date to the Jōmon period, from about 14,000 BC to 300 BC. Clay figurines (dogū) and some of the world&#x27;s oldest pottery, discovered at sites in northern Japan, have been designated as the second oldest National Treasures in the &quot;archaeological materials&quot; category. Some of the earliest items in this category are objects discovered in sutra mounds from the Kamakura period.

The starting date of designated &quot;crafts&quot;, &quot;writings&quot;, and &quot;sculptures&quot; is connected to the introduction of Buddhism to Japan in 552. A proportion of the oldest designated National Treasures of these categories were directly imported from mainland China and Korea. After the Kamakura period, the art of Japanese sculpture, which had been mainly religious in nature, deteriorated. Consequently, there are no National Treasure sculptures from after the Kamakura period.

<text>The Karwendel is the largest mountain range of the Northern Limestone Alps. It is located on the Austria–Germany border. The major part belongs to the Austrian federal state of Tyrol, while the adjacent area in the north is part of Bavaria, Germany. Four chains stretch from west to east; in addition, there are a number of fringe ranges and an extensive promontory (&quot;Vorkarwendel&quot;) in the north.

==Geography==
The term Karwendel describes the part of the Alps between the Isar river and the Seefeld Saddle mountain pass in the west and Achen Lake in the east. In the north it stretches to the Bavarian Prealps. In the south the Lower Inn Valley with the city of Innsbruck separates the Karwendel from the Central Eastern Alps. Other major settlements include Seefeld in Tirol and Mittenwald in the west, as well as Eben am Achensee in the east. Neighbouring ranges are the Wetterstein and Mieming Mountains in the west and the Brandenberg Alps in the east.

The mountaineer Hermann von Barth created the tradition of naming the Karwendel chains ranges after the valleys limiting them in the south: Karwendel valley, Hinterau valley and Vomper Loch, Gleirsch valley, Hall valley, and Inn valley: 
*Northern Karwendel Chain
*Hinterautal-Vomper Chain (a.k.a. main Karwendel Range),
*Gleirsch-Halltal Chain
*Nordkette (a.k.a. Solstein Range or Inn Valley Range). 
Side ranges are the Erlspitze Group, Soiern Group and Vorkarwendel, Falken Group, Gamsjoch Group and Sonnjoch Group.

<doc id="1137441" wikidata="Q1755056" url="?curid=1137441" title="Hypostomus">
<text>Hypostomus is a genus of catfish in the family Loricariidae. They are native to tropical and subtropical South America. &quot;H. plecostomus&quot; is the popular freshwater aquarium fish formerly known as &quot;Plecostomus plecostomus&quot;. The taxonomic structure of the Loricariidae is still being expanded by scientists. &quot;Hypostomus&quot; is a highly species-rich and widely distributed catfish genus.
==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
This genus is the type member of its tribe Hypostomini and subfamily Hypostominae. The type species of &quot;Hypostomus&quot; is &quot;H. guacari&quot;.

With the inclusion of &quot;Aphanotorulus&quot;, &quot;Isorineloricaria&quot; and &quot;Squaliforma&quot;, the genus &quot;Hypostomus&quot; is by far the largest genus of Loricariidae and the second largest genus of catfish. However, a good way to split up the genus further is unclear. Species level taxonomy of &quot;Hypostomus&quot; is still poorly known as well as the phylogenetic relationships within and of the genus. It has been shown that the genus does not form a natural group. However, small monophyletic groups are known to exist within the genus &quot;Hypostomus&quot;, such as the &quot;H. cochliodon&quot; group. &quot;Aphanotorulus&quot; and &quot;Isorineloricaria&quot; are considered separate genera by some authors based on molecular information.

Studies conducted with representatives of some genera of Hypostominae showed that within this group, the diploid number ranges from 2n = 52 to 2n = 80. However, the supposed wide karyotypic diversity that the family Loricariidae or the subfamily Hypostominae would present is almost exclusively restricted to the genus &quot;Hypostomus&quot; and the species from the other genera had a conserved diploid number.

==Distribution and habitat==
These species are originate from freshwater habitats of South America and the Caribbean island of Trinidad. They are found throughout most of the range of loricariids except for drainages west of the Atrato River (northwest Colombia). They are essentially ubiquitous throughout their range. Maximum diversity in number of species of &quot;Hypostomus&quot; occurs in rivers of the Paraná-Paraguay system.

&quot;Hypostomus&quot; species are found in almost all aquatic habitats, from large rivers to small rivulets. The typical habitat would be relatively fast moving water over a shallow gravel bed. Most species are lowland, sluggish stream- and lake-dwellers usually found associated with submerged wood; however, many species may be found among rocks in piedmont to mountain streams with moderate to swift flow. Members of this genus may be found over a range of substrates such mud, detritus, gravel, and sand. Many species spawn in hollows dug into mud banks or within hollow logs.

==Description and ecology==
As in all loricariids, these species have a suckermouth. They use their mouth as well as the pectoral, pelvic and caudal fin areas, to interact with the rocky river-bottom. The comb-toothed inferior mouth of &quot;Hypostomus&quot; is able to grasp green algae on the river bottom. With the help of the suckermouth, which anchor the fishes, in conjunction with the arched design of pectoral and pelvic fin spines, they are also able to remain upright while exploring this substratum. In addition, their large, concave caudal fin is associated with fast locomotion over short distances.

Also like other loricariids, &quot;Hypostomus&quot; species exhibit plates of armor over their body. The colouration among &quot;Hypostomus&quot; species varies. They may have a white ground color and black spots, or brown and spotted, or even black with red, gold, or white spots. Abdomen also varies in color from white to black and may be spotted or not. The caudal fin is forked with the lower lobe longer than upper. Most species have stout bodies, but some do have thinner, elongate bodies.

In most species, males develop hypertrophied odontodes on the leading edge of the pectoral fin spine and the end of the spine may become swollen. In some species, the males may also develop hypertrophied odontodes on the body during the breeding season.

&quot;Hypostomus&quot; species are well known for the ability to breathe air. This is achieved through a slightly modified stomach that is larger and thinner than in non-air breathers. To breathe air, &quot;Hypostomus&quot; must orient itself vertically.

Species of the &quot;H. cochliodon&quot; group are fairly large loricariids that reach about 30 centimetres (12 in) SL. Their colouration is typically dark brown with spots generally developed over most surfaces; however, most species of this group have been observed to have a well-developed ability to alter color according to substrate. Except for &quot;H. sculpodon&quot;, these species tend to have a deep body at the dorsal fin origin; this makes the body appear humped. Along with &quot;Panaque&quot;, species of the &quot;H. cochliodon&quot; group are unique among loricariids for xylophagy, or the ability to digest wood, accomplished through specialized spoon-shaped teeth. In &quot;H. hemicochliodon&quot; and &quot;H. sculpodon&quot; appear to be intermediate between other species of &quot;Hypostomus&quot; and the &quot;H. cochilodon&quot; group by feeding less on wood and lacking specialized teeth; many other &quot;Hypostomus&quot; will occasionally eat wood, but wood only amounts to a very small fraction of their diet.

==Species==


There are currently 156 recognized species in this genus:

<text>Pariah (Kell Mossa) is a fictional character in stories published by DC Comics. He is a cosmologist who first appeared as a pivotal character during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline.

==Publication history==
Pariah first appeared in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #1 (April 1985), and was created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez.

==Fictional biography==
Pariah is a scientist from an unidentified alternate universe that was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor. The Monitor rescues him and forces him to witness the destruction of others universes.

In &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Anti-Monitor escapes his prison and ravages the multiverse. After the Anti-Monitor is destroyed and the multiverse reduced to a singular universe, Pariah, Lady Quark, and Harbinger embark to explore it.

Years later, Pariah is killed by Alexander Luthor Jr. In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, he is temporarily resurrected as a Black Lantern.

Pariah is resurrected in &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, where he makes a minor appearance as a prisoner of A.R.G.U.S.

In &quot;Dark Crisis&quot;, Pariah is corrupted by the Great Darkness and battles the Justice League before being killed by his anti-matter cannon.

==Powers and abilities==
Pariah is seemingly indestructible and immortal. He possesses superhuman physical abilities and can fly and teleport between universes. Using the Great Darkness, he can create pocket dimensions and erase others from existence.

==In other media==
* An original incarnation of Pariah, Nash Wells, appears in the Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (2019), portrayed by Tom Cavanagh.
* An original incarnation of Pariah, John Constantine, appears in the Tomorrowverse films &quot;Green Lantern: Beware My Power&quot; and &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, voiced by Nolan North.

<doc id="1137448" wikidata="Q3216027" url="?curid=1137448" title="Lady Quark">
<text>Lady Quark is a fictional character, a superheroine in the DC Universe. In the DC Comics 12-issue limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (1985-1986), the character was one of the rulers of Earth-Six, which was ruled by royalty. In 2011 introduction of The New 52 DC Multiverse, she and her husband Lord Volt are now the monarchs of Earth 48, which appears to be a modern analogue of Earth-Six in the original DC multiverse.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Lady Quark comes from Earth-Six, where the American Revolutionary War was not won by the Thirteen Colonies and where technology has become more advanced than Earth-One. Lady Quark, her husband Karak (&quot;Lord Volt&quot;), and daughter Liana (&quot;Princess Fern&quot;) make up the royal family that rules Earth-6. While Lord Volt and Princess Fern are both killed when Earth-Six is destroyed during the Crisis, Lady Quark is saved at the last minute by Pariah, a dimensional traveler. Lady Quark helps most of the multiverse&#x27;s surviving heroes and they journey to the Dawn of Time to battle the Anti-Monitor. After the Crisis is over, Lady Quark resettles on Earth with Pariah and the Harbinger.

Missing her husband, Lady Quark approaches Will Payton with the idea of having him become her consort in &quot;Starman&quot; #8 (March 1989), but Payton rejects her advances.

===L.E.G.I.O.N.===
Lady Quark is eventually recruited by Vril Dox to become a member of the peace-keeping force L.E.G.I.O.N. in &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;90&quot; #18. Lady Quark is apparently killed in &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;94&quot; #62 after a parasitic shapeshifter absorbs her memories and powers. The shapeshifter replaces her in L.E.G.I.O.N., but later dies in &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N. &#x27;94&quot; #70. Lady Quark&#x27;s corpse is later seen floating in space, heavily maimed.

===Return===
Eleven years later, Lady Quark returns alive and well without explanation in &quot;Villains United&quot; #5 (2005), in which she is captured by Sinestro at the request of Alexander Luthor, Jr. She is imprisoned in Luthor&#x27;s tower as part of his plan to bring the core Earths of the Multiverse back into existence. Lady Quark is later freed and joins Earth&#x27;s heroes in defeating Luthor in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005-2006).

Lady Quark appears again in several splash pages of &quot;Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime&quot; (December 2007), and again in a double page spread of Legionnaires and characters associated with the Legion of Super-Heroes in &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; #5 (July 2009).

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; 2011 reboot of &quot;Vibe&quot;, Lady Quark is revealed to be one of Amanda Waller&#x27;s and A.R.G.U.S&#x27;s interdimensional prisoners. Vibe releases Lady Quark, along with Gypsy, Pariah, and several other formerly absent characters, and the former prisoners begin to attack Amanda Waller and A.R.G.U.S.

===Multiversity: Earth-48===
In Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Multiversity&quot; series, Lady Quark and her husband, Lord Volt, appear as residents of Earth 48 of &quot;The New 52&quot; &#x27;s modified DC Multiverse. According to subsequent information, this iteration of Earth-48 is a fusion of the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Six and Warworld (&quot;52&quot; &#x27;s Earth-48). Lady Quark, Lord Volt and their daughter Liana are members of Earth 48&#x27;s royal family, much as they were on Earth-Six.

===Infinite Frontier===
==Powers and abilities==
Lady Quark is a metahuman with the ability to absorb and emit nuclear energies. She can direct these energies as percussive forces from her body. Her powers allow her to fly and travel through space. If her unexplained reappearance is taken as is, it may be assumed she can regenerate herself even from seeming death.

==Other versions==
An older version of Lady Quark becomes one-half of the tyrannical ruler of L.E.G.I.O.N.

Lady Quark is featured-along with Lord Volt in a &quot;Convergence&quot; tie-in, fighting Matrix-Supergirl. Her daughter, Princess Fern, is featured in another &quot;Convergence&quot; tie-in, fighting Parallax. Fern&#x27;s parents are seen on Monitor screens.

<doc id="1137458" wikidata="Q7960415" url="?curid=1137458" title="Wait for Me (Susan Tedeschi album)">
<text>Wait for Me is the third studio album by American blues artist Susan Tedeschi, released in 2002.

==Reception==

The track titled &quot;Alone&quot; earned Tedeschi a nomination for &quot;Best Female Rock Vocal Performance&quot; at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, while the album earned her a nomination for &quot;Best Contemporary Blues Album&quot; at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards.

In a review for AllMusic, Hal Horowitz wrote: &quot;With classy yet scorching performances and songs infused with roots rock, blues, funk, and even pop, it&#x27;s a crossover album that oozes with integrity, terrific playing, and a loose yet distinctive direction.&quot;

The authors of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings&quot; called Tedeschi&#x27;s voice &quot;flexible and soaring,&quot; but criticized the inclusion of songs that &quot;are awash with clichés that suppress individuality.&quot;

Geoffrey Himes of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that Tedeschi &quot;possesses a powerful soprano, an appealing blues-mama persona and good taste in songwriters,&quot; and suggested that her collaboration with Derek Trucks &quot;sound[s] so comfortable that one wishes the married couple would join forces permanently.&quot;

Writing for &quot;All About Jazz&quot;, Charlie B. Dahan stated that Tedeschi &quot;has matured and thus as an artist she must progress. &quot;Wait For Me&quot; examines the soulful side of music and does a damn good job of it.&quot;

&quot;The Morning Call&quot;&#x27;s Jodi Duckett called the album &quot;a significant step forward,&quot; and noted that &quot;Tedeschi has widened her musical scope considerably.&quot;

Chris Gardner of &quot;Jambands.com&quot; praised &quot;the gritty authenticity of the music,&quot; and remarked: &quot;The album cover suggests a woman trying hard to impress. The music within doesn&#x27;t try to impress. It just does.&quot;

In an article for &quot;The Music Box&quot;, John Metzger described the album as &quot;a welcome comeback — one that often recalls the gospel blues of Etta James mixed with the soulful folk of Van Morrison,&quot; but noted that &quot;it still falls a bit short of what she is capable of producing.&quot;

<doc id="1137460" wikidata="Q6938803" url="?curid=1137460" title="Murney Tower">
<text>Murney Tower is a Martello tower in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, whose construction dates to January 1846. The Tower was built in response to the Oregon Crisis, which was a tense dispute over the border between British North America and the United States in the 1840s.

The tower is one of five components of Kingston&#x27;s fortifications that defended Kingston Harbour, the Naval Dockyard, military supply depot and the southern entrance of the Rideau Canal. Murney Tower complements the fortifications of Fort Henry, Ontario, Cathcart Tower on Cedar Island, Shoal Tower in the Confederation Basin and Fort Frederick on the grounds of the Royal Military College of Canada. In addition to protecting the harbour and approaches to Kingston, these fortifications were designed to concentrate fire on Gardiners Island; it being the only place to effectively land artillery at the time.

== History ==
=== Background ===
When the tower was first constructed they planned to call it Murray Tower after the Master General of Ordnance. The land however, was owned by the Murney family and was called Murney Point by the locals. They thus began calling the tower, Murney Tower. This name stuck. The original inscription stone above the door read ‘Murray Tower.’ An ‘N’ was affixed over the first ‘R’ so that the current sign reads ‘MURNAY TOWER’, a hybrid spelling of the two versions.

Construction began on the tower on February 7, 1846. On June 15 of the same year the Oregon treaty was resolved, reducing tensions with the Americans. On June 19, the walls were built to their full height. Construction of the tower was finished on November 10, 1846.

=== Life in the tower ===
The tower was occupied from 1848 until 1885. The main floor (ground level) was the barracks level where the soldiers and their families lived, ate, and slept. It was manned by the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment until 1870, then by Battery A until 1880, and Battery B until 1884. After 1885 it was watched by the Princess of Wales Own Regiment. It could house a maximum of 24 soldiers and one officer or multiple soldiers and their families.

A birth was recorded in the tower in 1882. Sergeant Thomas Pugh and his wife Martha Mary lived in the tower with their seven children: William, Thomas, James, Murney May, Lillian, Bertha, and Sydney. Murney May Pugh was born in May while her family was living in the Tower. She eventually left Kingston to become a nurse and served overseas in the First World War. The Pugh family have had a significant impact on Kingston and Canada&#x27;s history, serving over 470 years in the military.

== Architecture and defenses ==

The tower stands surrounded by a dry-ditch and is accessible only by a bridge. When the tower was originally built, there was no bridge to cross the dry-ditch. It is likely that soldiers would have accessed the tower through two ladders placed in the ditch. Murney Tower was constructed with locally quarried limestone with special brickwork on the barracks and basement levels of the tower&#x27;s interior. On the thickest side the walls are about 15 ft. thick at the base and 13 ft. thick up top. On the weaker side the walls are about 8 ft. thick. The walls are thicker on the south side because a naval attack from the Americans was the most likely form of attack and thus is what the tower is prepared for. Cannonballs from enemy ships should have theoretically bounced right off the walls.

Currently, the barracks has two internal carronade cannons that would have fired 32-lb cannonballs directed out shuttered windows. These carronades had a range of 400 metres and would have been used for anti-personnel warfare in case of a land attack. These cannons could be moved about the interior embrasures, and so cover multiple approaches, including the bridge.

The lower floor contained the ventilated gunpowder and artillery magazines and storage rooms, along with 4 capponieres, which acted as a defense system for the dry-ditch surrounding the Tower, allowing soldiers to fire through small loopholes at troops attacking the Towers base. Caponiers were unique to the Kingston Martello Towers, due to controversy surrounding them. The walls are much thinner in the caponiere than in the rest of the tower and are thus more vulnerable to attack. However, they also provided troops with the opportunity to protect the dry ditch through rifle loops, with strategic additional doors and rifle holes meant to keep out any enemy who successfully breached the caponier.

The uppermost level is the artillery or gun platform, which supports a Blomefield cannon (which also fired 32-lb cannonballs) that could be rotated along an iron track, thus, providing full coverage around the Tower&#x27;s entire circumference. The Blomefield cannon was redesigned by Thomas Blomefield, Inspector of Artillery and Superintendent of the Royal Brass Foundry in 1780. Blomefield redesigned the Armstrong cannon that had been previously used by the British forces, replacing it with a cannon that was simpler in design, lighter, and had more effective recoil restraint. The cannon weighs 6429 lbs, with a range of 2000 metres. 
Roofs are not original Mediterranean design of Martello towers, but a temporary snow roof was later added to the open gun platform two years after the tower&#x27;s construction protects the gun and keeps out the large amounts of snow. The addition of a roof is a common feature on Canadian Martellos. The original roof was installed in 1849. In 1921 a windstorm removed the original wooden and tin roof. Parts of the roof date to the reconstruction that followed in 1925, but the majority of the present roof dates from the 1970s and is not removable for safety reasons. 
Despite being one of the most sophisticated Martello towers designed and built by the British, Murney Tower quickly became obsolete due to improvements made in military weaponry and ship design.

== Present day ==
In 1925, the museum was opened as a museum for the public by the Kingston Historical Society. It continues to be operated by the Kingston Historical Society as the Murney Tower Museum through the summer months (May - Labour Day in September). Displays include three cannons (32-pounder), period uniforms, muskets, and other mid-19th century military artifacts.

Although 14 Martello towers were built in Canada, only 9 are still standing, 4 of them in Kingston. Currently, only Murney Tower Museum is open to the public. Fort Henry has two towers that resemble Martello towers, however, they are branch ditch towers.

=== Designations ===

In 1930 Murney Tower was designated a national historic site due to its sophisticated design.

In 1989 the Kingston Fortifications were designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

In 2007, the Rideau Canal and Kingston Fortifications (including Murney Tower) were recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was recognized as having played an important role in the defense of British North America and in enabling Canada to develop its own political and cultural identity

<text>The underclass is the segment of the population that occupies the lowest possible position in a class hierarchy, below the core body of the working class. This group is usually considered cut off from the rest of the society.

The general idea that a class system includes a population &quot;under&quot; the working class has a long tradition in the social sciences (for example, lumpenproletariat). However, the specific term, &quot;underclass&quot;, was popularized during the last half of the 20th century, first by social scientists of American poverty, and then by American journalists.

The underclass concept has been a point of controversy among social scientists. Definitions and explanations of the underclass, as well as proposed solutions for managing or fixing the &quot;underclass problem&quot; have been highly debated. 

==History==
Gunnar Myrdal is generally credited as the first proponent of the term &quot;underclass.&quot; Writing in the early 1960s on economic inequality in the U.S., Myrdal&#x27;s underclass refers to a &quot;class of unemployed, unemployables, and underemployed, who are more and more hopelessly set apart from the nation at large, and do not share in its life, its ambitions, and its achievements&quot;. However, this general conception of a class or category of people below the core of the working class has a long tradition in the social sciences, such as through the work of Henry Mayhew, whose &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot; sought to describe the hitherto invisible world of casual workers, prostitutes, and street-people.

The specific concept of an underclass in the U.S. underwent several transformations during the decades following Myrdal&#x27;s introduction of the term. According to sociologist Herbert Gans, while Myrdal&#x27;s structural conceptualization of the underclass remained relatively intact through the writings of William Julius Wilson and others, in several respects the &quot;structural&quot; definition was abandoned by many journalists and academics, and replaced with a &quot;behavioral&quot; conception of the underclass, which fuses Myrdal&#x27;s term with Oscar Lewis&#x27;s and others&#x27; conception of a &quot;culture of poverty&quot;.

==Definitions==

Various definitions of the underclass have been set forth since the term&#x27;s initial conception; however, all of these definitions are basically different ways of imagining a category of people beneath the working class. The definitions vary by which particular dimensions of this group are highlighted. A few popular descriptions of the underclass are considered as follows.

===Focus on economics===
Marxian sociologist Erik Olin Wright sees the underclass as a &quot;category of social agents who are economically oppressed but not consistently exploited within a given class system&quot;. The underclass occupies the lowest possible rung on a class ladder. According to Wright, the underclass are oppressed. He believes this is because they are generally denied access to the labor market, and thus they cannot rise above their status easily but also thus are &quot;not consistently exploited&quot; because the opportunity for their economic exploitation is minimal for the classes above.

Unlike the working class, which he believes is routinely exploited for their labor power by higher classes, the underclass in Wright&#x27;s view, do not hold the labor power worthy of exploitation. Wright argues his highly doctrinaire opinion of class malevolence that:

This quote partly concerns the spaces and locations for the underclass and reflects the leftist view of the other classes as acting against the underclass in unison, as opposed to other sociological views seeing class actors behaving as individuals reacting to individual incentives within society.

===Focus on space and place===
The underclass generally occupies specific zones in the city. Thus, the notion of an underclass is popular in Urban Sociology, and particularly in accounts of urban poverty. The term, &quot;underclass&quot;, and the phrase, &quot;urban underclass&quot;, are, for the most part, used interchangeably. Studies concerning the post-civil rights African American ghetto often include a discussion of the urban underclass. Many writings concerning the underclass, particularly in the U.S., are urban-focused.

William Julius Wilson&#x27;s books,&quot; The Declining Significance of Race&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Truly Disadvantaged&quot; (1987), are popular accounts of the black urban underclass. Wilson defines the underclass as &quot;a massive population at the very bottom of the social ladder plagued by poor education and low-paying jobs.&quot; He generally limits his discussion to those trapped in the post-civil-rights ghetto in the American rust belt (see &quot;Potential Causes and Proposed Solutions&quot; section of this entry for a more detailed summary of Wilson on the underclass).

Elijah Anderson&#x27;s, &quot;Streetwise&quot; (1990), employs ethnographic methods to study a gentrifying neighborhood, &quot;The Village&quot; (pseudonym), bordering a black ghetto, &quot;Northton&quot; (pseudonym), in an American city. Anderson provides the following description of the underclass in this ghetto:

===Focus on behavior===
Lawrence M. Mead defines the underclass as a group that is poor and behaviorally deficient. He describes the underclass as &quot;dysfunctional.&quot; He provides the following definition in his 1986 book, &quot;Beyond Entitlement&quot;,

Ken Auletta, often credited as the primary journalist who brought the underclass term to the forefront of the American consciousness, describes the American underclass as non-assimilated Americans, and he suggests that the underclass may be subcategorized into four distinct groups:

===Controversies amongst definitions===
Each of the above definitions are said to conceptualize the same general group – the American underclass – but they provide somewhat competing imagery. While Wright, Wilson, and Anderson each position the underclass in reference to the labor market, Auletta&#x27;s definition is simply &quot;non-assimilation&quot; and his examples, along with Mead&#x27;s definition, highlight underclass members&#x27; participation in deviant behavior and their adoption of an antisocial outlook on life. These controversies are elaborated further in the next section (&quot;Characteristics of the Underclass&quot;).

As evident with Mead and Auletta&#x27;s framing, some definitions of the underclass significantly diverge from the initial notion of an &quot;economic group&quot; beneath the working class. A few writings on the underclass distinguish between various types of underclass, such as the social underclass, the impoverished underclass, the reproductive underclass, the educational underclass, the violent underclass, and the criminal underclass, with some expected horizontal mobility between these groups. Even more divergent from the initial notion of an underclass are the recent journalistic accounts of a so-called &quot;genetic underclass&quot;, referring to a genetic inheritance of a predisposition to addiction and other personality traits traditionally associated with behavioral definitions of the underclass. However, such distinctions between criminal, social, impoverished, and other specified underclass terms still refer to the same general group—those beneath the working class. And, despite recent journalistic accounts of a &quot;genetic underclass&quot;, the underclass concept is primarily, and has traditionally been, a social science term.

==Characteristics==
The underclass is located by a collection of identifying characteristics, such as high levels of joblessness, out-of-wedlock births, crime, violence, substance abuse, and high school dropout rates. The underclass harbors these traits to a greater degree than the general population, and other classes more specifically.

Joel Rogers and James Wright identify four general themes by which these characteristics are organized within academic and journalistic accounts of the underclass: economic, social-psychological, behavioral, and ecological (spatial concentration).

===Economic characteristics===
The economic dimension is the most basic and least contested theme of the underclass – the underclass is overwhelmingly poor. The underclass experiences high levels of joblessness, and what little employment its members hold in the formal economy is best described as precarious labor. However, it is important to note that simply being poor is not synonymous with being part of the underclass. The underclass is &quot;persistently poor&quot; and, for most definitions, the underclass live in areas of concentrated poverty. Some scholars, such as Ricketts and Sawhill, argue that being poor is not a requirement for underclass membership, and thus there are individuals who are non-poor members of the underclass because they live in &quot;underclass areas&quot; and embody other characteristics of the underclass, such as being violent, criminal, and anti-social (e.g., gang leaders).

===Social-psychological characteristics===
Many writers often highlight the social-psychological dimensions of the underclass. The underclass is often framed as holding beliefs, attitudes, opinions, and desires that are inconsistent with those held by society at large. The underclass is frequently described as a &quot;discouraged&quot; group with members who feel &quot;cut off&quot; from mainstream society. Linked to this discussion of the underclass being psychologically deviant, the underclass is also said to have low levels of cognition and literacy. Thus, the underclass is often seen as being mentally disconnected from the rest of society. Consider the following:

===Behavioral characteristics===
Not only is the underclass frequently said to think differently, they are also said to behave differently. Some believe that the underclass concept was meant to capture the coincidence of a number of social ills including poverty, joblessness, crime, welfare dependence, fatherless families, and low levels of education or work related skills. These behavioral characteristics, coupled with arguments that the underclass is psychologically disconnected from mainstream society, are occasionally highlighted as evidence that the underclass live in a subculture of poverty. From this point of view, members of the underclass embody a distinct set of thoughts, perceptions, and actions – a &quot;style of life&quot; - that are transmitted across generations. However, just as the conceptualization of a &quot;culture of poverty&quot; in general is debated, so too are the attempts to frame the underclass as members of such a culture.

===Ecological (spatial) characteristics===
The ecological dimension, a fourth theme in the literature on the underclass, is often used as both a description and an explanation for the underclass. The underclass is concentrated in specific areas. Although there are some writings on the &quot;rural underclass&quot;, in general the underclass is framed as an urban phenomenon and the phrases &quot;ghetto poverty&quot; and &quot;inner-city poverty&quot; are often used synonymously with the underclass term. However, many scholars are careful not to equate concentrated poverty with the underclass. Living in areas of concentrated poverty is more or less framed as a common (and often necessary) condition of the underclass, but it is generally not considered a sufficient condition since many conceptualizations of the underclass highlight behavioral and psychological deviancy that may not necessarily persist in high-poverty areas. In Wilson&#x27;s writings on the underclass – a term he eventually replaces with &quot;ghetto poverty&quot; (see section titled &quot;Critiques of the Underclass Concept&quot;)– the underclass is described as a population that is physically and socially isolated from individuals and institutions of mainstream society, and this isolation is one of a collection of causes to concentrated poverty and why the &quot;social dislocations&quot; (e.g., crime, school dropouts, out of wed-lock pregnancy, etc.) of the underclass emerge.

Thus, the underclass is defined and identified by multiple characteristics. Members are persistently poor and experience high levels of joblessness. However, these trends are generally not seen as sufficient identifiers of the underclass, because, for many, the underclass concept also captures dimensions of psychological and behavioral deviancy. Furthermore, the underclass is generally identified as an urban phenomenon with its members typically living in areas of concentrated poverty.

==Potential causes and proposed solutions==
Similar to issues of defining and identifying the underclass, the outlining of potential causes and proposed solutions for the &quot;underclass problem&quot; have also been points of contestation. Debates concerning the diagnosis of, and prescription for, the underclass often mirror debates concerning first world poverty more generally. However, in many writings on the specific notion of the underclass, some particular causes and solutions have been set forth.

A few of these propositions are outlined below, including those developed by William Julius Wilson, Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton, Lawrence M. Mead, and Ken Auletta. The work by these authors&#x27; certainly do not compile an exhaustive list of suggested causes or solutions for the underclass, but they are arguably the most read proposals among social scientists. The contrasting causes and solutions highlighted by Wilson and Mead in particular have been popular points for debate. However, because prescription is dependent on diagnosis, much of the debates between Wilson and Mead have been on the causes and conditions of the underclass. Wilson highlights social isolation and the disappearance of quality work (for example, via deindustrialization and offshore labor outsourcing) for ghetto residents, while Mead highlights an overgenerous and permissive welfare state. Massey and Denton link the creation of the underclass to racial residential segregation and advocate for policies encouraging desegregation. Auletta provides a different policy framework discussion by highlighting two extreme positions (the wholesale option and the laissez-faire option) and one middle-of-the-road position (the retail option), but these are more discussions concerning the amount of public resources that should be dedicated to fixing, or attempting to fix, the underclass problem, rather than specific strategies. Auletta seems to support the retail option, which would provide aid to underclass members deserving and hopeful and withhold aid to members undeserving and hopeless.

===Wilson&#x27;s diagnosis and prescription===
For Wilson, the cause of the underclass is structural. In &quot;The Truly Disadvantaged&quot;, Wilson highlights a conglomerate of factors in the last half of the twentieth century leading to a growing urban underclass. The factors listed include but are not limited to the shift from a goods-producing economy to a service-producing economy (including deindustrialization) and the offshore outsourcing of labor not only in the industrial sector but also in substantial portions of the remaining service sector. These factors are aggravated by the exodus of the middle and upper classes from the inner city (first the well-known &quot;white flight&quot; and later the less-studied departure of the black middle class), which creates a &quot;spatial mismatch&quot; between where low-income people live (inner-city neighborhoods) and where low-skill service-sector jobs are available (the suburbs). The result is the transformation of the post-civil-rights-era inner city into a &quot;ghetto&quot; whose residents are isolated from mainstream institutions.

Wilson proposes a comprehensive social and economic program that is primarily universal, but nevertheless includes targeted efforts to improve the life chances of the ghetto underclass and other disadvantaged groups. Wilson lists multiple examples of what this universal program would include, such as public funding of training, retraining, and transitional employment benefits that would be available to all members of society. With respect to the diagnosis of concentration and isolation, Wilson suggests the promotion of social mobility, through programs that will increase employment prospects for the underclass, will lead to geographic mobility. Wilson describes his proposed program as having a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; for policy makers &quot;to improve the life chances of truly disadvantaged groups such as the ghetto underclass by emphasizing programs to which the more advantaged groups of all races and class backgrounds can positively relate&quot;. Universal programs are more easily accepted within the US&#x27; political climate than targeted programs, yet the underclass would likely experience the most benefit from universal programs. Wilson notes that some means-tested programs are still necessary, but recommends that they be framed as secondary to universal programming efforts. The following quote summarizes his policy call:

===Massey and Denton&#x27;s diagnosis and prescription===
In their 1993 book, &quot;American Apartheid&quot;, sociologists Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton concur with much of Wilson&#x27;s suggested causes and proposed solutions, but introduce racial residential segregation (as an outcome of both institutionalized and individual-level discrimination) as an explanatory factor. Massey and Denton argue that racial residential segregation is primarily an outcome of institutionalized racism in real estate and banking, coupled with, and significantly motivated by, individual-level prejudice and discrimination. They provide the following summary,
 
Given the prominent role of segregation in the construction and maintenance of the urban underclass, Massey and Denton call for policies that promote desegregation. They provide a detailed list of policy suggestions in the closing of their book. They argue that policies aimed at desegregation need to target the private housing market, where an overwhelming majority of housing is allocated. In doing this, the authors call upon the federal government to dedicate more resources to the upholding of the Fair Housing Act, including speedy judicial action against violators (to strengthen deterrent effects of the legislation).

===Mead&#x27;s diagnosis and prescription===
Mead argues that the core cause of the underclass problem (or at least the perpetuation of the underclass problem) is welfare. Mead argues that most welfare programs encourage social dysfunctions, including welfare dependency, illegitimate births, joblessness, and crime. For Mead, welfare is too permissive and provides benefits to the underclass without requirements for its members to change their behavior and lifestyle.

Mead&#x27;s diagnosis that permissive welfare is a primary cause of the underclass problem is followed by a prescription for a more authoritative welfare program that combines benefits with requirements. This proposal is often called &quot;workfare&quot;, which requires welfare recipients to work in order to receive aid. For Mead, such a program design would evoke behavioral change since permissiveness is replaced with authority. Mead summarizes his call to replace permissive welfare with authoritative welfare:

===Auletta&#x27;s three typologies of solutions===
Ken Auletta closes his book, &quot;The Underclass&quot; (1982), by highlighting three typologies of solutions: &quot;the wholesale option&quot;, &quot;the laissez-faire option&quot;, and &quot;the retail option&quot;.

The &quot;wholesale option&quot; includes both conservatives and liberals who are optimistic that government action can solve the underclass problem. According to Auletta, left-wing wholesale proponents call for increased public aid while right-wing wholesale proponents call for government to reduce taxes to increase jobs (inspired by trickle-down economic theory) and charge the government to &quot;get tough&quot; on underclass crime and welfare dependency.

The &quot;laissez-faire option&quot; is pessimistic and its proponents are extremely wary of proposed solutions to a problem they see as unsolvable. Proponents of this perspective call for a drastic withdrawal of public aid for the underclass and are concerned with &quot;quarantining the patient&quot; instead of hunting for what they believe is an imaginary cure. In other words, the laissez-faire option assumes that the underclass is generally hopeless, and thus the only public effort given to them should be the bare minimum.

The &quot;retail option&quot; includes those in between optimism and pessimism, what Auletta calls &quot;skeptics&quot;. The retail option advocates for targeted efforts, recognizing the limits of government intervention, but is also aware of the positive impact social policy can have on efforts to fix specific problems of the underclass. This middle ground perspective requests that aid be given to members of the underclass considered to be deserving of aid, but withheld from members considered to be undeserving. However, proponents of the retail option often disagree on which members of the underclass are considered deserving and which are not. This appears to be the approach embraced by Auletta as he closes his book with reflections on some of the people he interviews throughout preceding pages. He says, &quot;I have no difficulty giving up on violent criminals like the Bolden brothers or street hustlers like Henry Rivera. But knowing how a government helping hand made it possible for Pearl Dawson and William Mason to succeed, would you be willing to write them off?&quot;

==Journalism==
Social scientists often point to journalism as a primary institution conceptualizing the underclass for a mass audience. Many suggest that the underclass terminology employed by American journalists in the last quarter of the twentieth-century were partial to behavioral and cultural—as opposed to a structural—definitions of the underclass.

While journalists&#x27; use of the underclass term is vast, a few popular sources are frequently cited in the academic literature on the underclass and journalism. Ken Auletta employed the underclass term in three articles published in The New Yorker in 1981, and in book form a year later. Auletta is arguably the most read journalist of the underclass and many of his ideas, including his definition of the underclass, are included in this Wikipedia entry.

Another notable journalist is Nicholas Lemann who published a handful of articles on the underclass in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; during the late 1980s and early 1990s. His 1986 writings on &quot;The Origins of the Underclass&quot; argue that the underclass was created by two migrations, the great migration of Southern blacks to the North and West during the early to mid twentieth century and the exodus of middle class blacks out of the ghetto during the 1970s through the early 90s. In 1991 Lemann also published an article titled &quot;The Other Underclass&quot;, which details Puerto Ricans, and particularly Puerto Ricans residing in South Bronx, as members of the urban underclass in the US.

==Critiques of the concept==
Following the popularization of the underclass concept in both academic and journalistic writings, some academics began to overtly criticize underclass terminology. Those in opposition to the underclass concept generally argue that, on the one hand, &quot;underclass&quot; is a homogenizing term that simplifies a heterogeneous group, and on the other hand, the term is derogatory and demonizes the urban poor.

===Derogatory and demonizing language===
Many who reject the underclass concept suggest that the &quot;underclass&quot; term has been transformed into a codeword to refer to poor inner-city blacks. For example, Hilary Silver highlights a moment when David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the KKK, campaigned for Louisiana Governor by complaining about the &quot;welfare underclass&quot;. The underclass concept has been politicized, with those from the political left arguing that joblessness and insufficient welfare provided are causes of underclass conditions while the political right employ the underclass term to refer to welfare dependency and moral decline. Many sociologists suggest that this latter rhetoric – the right-wing perspective – became dominant in mainstream accounts of the underclass during the later decades of the twentieth-century.

Herbert Gans is one of the most vocal critics of the underclass concept. Gans suggests that American journalists, inspired partly by academic writings on the &quot;culture of poverty&quot;, reframed &quot;underclass&quot; from a structural term (in other words, defining the underclass in reference to conditions of social/economic/political structure) to a behavioral term (in other words, defining the underclass in reference to rational choice and/or in reference to a subculture of poverty). Gans suggests that the word &quot;underclass&quot; has become synonymous with impoverished blacks that behave in criminal, deviant, or &quot;just non-middle-class ways&quot;.

Loïc Wacquant deploys a relatively similar critique by arguing that &quot;underclass&quot; has become a blanket term that frames urban blacks as behaviorally and culturally deviant. Wacquant notes that underclass status is imposed on urban blacks from outside and above them (e.g., by journalists, politicians, and academics), stating that &quot;underclass&quot; is a derogatory and &quot;negative label that nobody claims or invokes except to pin it on to others&quot;. And, although the underclass concepts is homogenizing, Wacquant argues that underclass imagery differentiates on gender lines, with the underclass male being depicted as a violent &quot;gang banger&quot;, a physical threat to public safety, and the underclass female being generalized as &quot;welfare mother&quot; (also see welfare queen), a &quot;moral assault on American values&quot;.

===Homogenizing a heterogeneous group===
The concept of &#x27;the ghetto&#x27; and &#x27;underclass&#x27; has also faced criticism empirically. Research has shown significant differences in resources for neighborhoods with similar populations both across cities and over time. This includes differences in the resources of neighborhoods with predominantly low income and/or racial minority populations. The cause of these differences in resources across similar neighborhoods has more to do with dynamics outside of the neighborhood. To a large extent the problem with the &#x27;ghetto&#x27; and &#x27;underclass&#x27; concepts stem from the reliance on case studies (in particular case studies from Chicago), which confine social scientist understandings of socially disadvantaged neighborhoods.

===Proposed replacement terms===
The charges against underclass terminology have motivated replacement terms. For example, William Julius Wilson, sympathetic to criticisms brought against underclass terminology (particularly those criticisms posited by Gans), begins to replace his use of the term underclass with &quot;ghetto poor&quot; during the early 1990s. For Wilson, this replacement terminology is simply an attempt to revamp the framing of inner-city poverty as being structurally rooted. He states, &quot;I will substitute the term &#x27;ghetto poor&#x27; for the term &#x27;underclass&#x27; and hope that I will not lose any of the subtle theoretical meaning that the latter term has had in my writings.&quot;

<doc id="1137468" wikidata="Q4356077" url="?curid=1137468" title="Transpacific Yacht Race">
<text>The Transpacific Yacht Race (Transpac) is a biennial offshore yacht race held in odd-numbered years starting off the Pt. Fermin buoy in San Pedro, California and ending off Diamond Head in Hawaii, a distance of around . In even-numbered years the Pacific Cup race starts out of San Francisco and is run by the Pacific Cup Yacht Club. Started in 1906 by Clarence W. Macfarlane and hosted by the Los Angeles Yacht Club, it is one of yachting&#x27;s premier offshore races and attracts entrants from all over the world. The race is organized by the Transpacific Yacht Club.

The race is famous for fast downwind sailing under spinnaker in the trade winds.

==Notable records==

*Fully Crewed Multihull Elapsed time: &quot;Mighty Merloe&quot; (ORMA 60 trimaran), 2017 of 4 days, 6 hours, 32 minutes, 30 seconds.
*Fully Crewed Monohull Elapsed time: &quot;Comanche&quot;, 2017 of 5 days, 1 hours, 55 minutes, 26 seconds.
*Double Handed: &quot;Pegasus 50&quot;, 2009, sailed by Philippe Kahn and Mark Christensen, set a new record of 7 days, 19 hours, 38 minutes and 35 seconds.

In 1969, French sailing legend Éric Tabarly shadowed the race with his Pen Duick IV, one of the world&#x27;s first trimarans competitive in all wind conditions. He originally intended to enter the race but was unaware that multihulls were not invited. Having started with all other participants, Tabarly and his crew set an unofficial record of 8 days and 13 hours, almost a day ahead of official winner and record-setter &quot;Blackfin&quot;.

In 2013, the fully crewed monohull, &quot;Dorade&quot;, won first overall, making it the oldest boat in the fleet to win and a 2-time winner, having won the Transpac in 1936, 77 years prior.

The 2019 edition of the race, its fiftieth, saw the sinking of a yacht for the first time in its history, when the 68 foot mono-hulled sailboat Santa Cruz 70 OEX suffered rudder damage and an uncontrollable water intrusion. The crew was rescued by another racing boat. This edition also saw the greatest number of skippers dropping out of the race.

==Record history==

&quot;Ragtime&quot; finished first in 1973 and again in 1975.

In 1977, the yacht &quot;Merlin,&quot; designed by Bill Lee, set an elapsed time record of 8 days, 11 hours, 1 minute. This record would stand for 20 years. Ending &quot;Merlin&#x27;s&quot; record, in the 1997 race a new monohull elapsed time record of 7 days, 11 hours, 41 minutes, and 27 seconds was set by Roy E. Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pyewacket&quot;, a Santa Cruz 70 ultralight also designed by Bill Lee. The record fell once again in 2005, with Hasso Plattner&#x27;s &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, a maxZ86 from Germany. &quot;Morning Glory&quot; was the scratch boat when it led a five-boat assault on the record for monohulls. She finished the race in 6 days, 16 hours, 4 minutes, and 11 seconds to win &quot;the Barn Door&quot; trophy, a slab of carved koa wood traditionally awarded to the monohull with the fastest elapsed time.

In 1995, multihulls were invited to participate for the first time, but not eligible for the Barn Door trophy. Steve Fosset set a new race record in 1995 on his 60&#x27; trimaran &quot;Lakota&quot;, of 6 days 16 hours 7 minutes 16 seconds. Two years later in 1997, this record was broken by the 86&#x27; catamaran &quot;Explorer&quot; with a time of 5 days 9 hours 18 minutes 26 seconds. 2017 saw Howard Enloe and his boat the Mighty Merloe smash the record by over 25 hours making the trip in just over 4 days.

On July 7, 2009, &quot;Alfa Romeo II&quot; beat the &quot;Morning Glory&quot; record for best day&#x27;s run set in the 2005 race, by sailing in 24 hours. The next two days she broke her own best-day record by sailing and . First to finish the 2009 Transpac, &quot;Alfa Romeo II&quot; set a Transpac race elapsed-time record of 5 days, 14 hours, 36 minutes, 20 seconds. This represents a new race record for monohulls; the multihull record of 5 days, 9 hours, 18 minutes, set by Bruno Peyron in the 1997 race, remains. However, because she must use &quot;stored power&quot; (a diesel engine) to move, &quot;Alfa Romeo II,&quot; sailing in the &quot;unlimited&quot; class, was not eligible for the traditional &quot;Barn Door&quot; trophy, but instead was the inaugural winner of a new trophy dedicated by Trisha Steele, called the &quot;&quot;Merlin&quot; Trophy&quot;. However from 2019 yachts eligible for this trophy must use manual power only

In the double-handed division, &quot;Pegasus 50,&quot; sailed by Philippe Kahn and Mark Christensen, set a new record of 7 days, 19 hours, 38 minutes and 35 seconds. They pioneered use of an iPhone, with Fullpower-MotionX GPS technology.

==References in popular culture==
In the 1975 movie &quot;Jaws&quot;, the character Matt Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss, claims that he has &quot;crewed three Transpacs&quot; as a means of establishing his seamanship credentials with Quint.

The 2008 documentary &quot;Morning Light&quot; is a film about the 2007 Disney-sponsored competitors in the race.

<text>Star routes is a term used in connection with the United States postal service and the contracting of mail delivery services. The term is defunct as of 1970, but still is occasionally used to refer to Highway Contract Routes (HCRs), which replaced the Star routes. The term is mostly used in connection with a series of scandals in the 1870s involving bribes to postal officials.

==Background==
Prior to 1845, transportation of inland mail, other than by railroad, was given to bidders who offered stage or coach service.

This was abolished by act of Congress on March 3, 1845, which provided that the postmaster-general should lease all such contracts to the lowest bidder who tendered sufficient guarantee of faithful performance, without any conditions, except to provide for due celerity, certainty and security of transportation. These bids became known as &quot;celerity, certainty and security bids&quot; and were designated on the route registers by three stars (***), thus becoming known as &quot;star routes.&quot;

==Star Route Frauds==

The Star Route Frauds scandal involved a lucrative 19th century scheme whereby postal officials received bribes in exchange for awarding postal delivery contracts in southern and western areas.

An investigation into the Star Routes corruption took place under President James A. Garfield in 1881. Two previous congressional investigations into the Star Route frauds had occurred in 1872 and 1876 during the Grant administration. The 1872 investigation results had been tainted by bribery, while the 1876 investigation managed to shut down the Star Route frauds temporarily. A resurgence of graft took place in 1878 in the Hayes administration, continuing into the Garfield administration. Among the major players involved were some of the large contractors, Bradley Barlow, a former US Representative of Vermont, the Second Assistant Postmaster-General, some of the subordinates in the department, and Arkansas Senator Stephen W. Dorsey, who became Secretary of the Republican National Committee during James A. Garfield&#x27;s 1880 presidential campaign. After Garfield&#x27;s death by assassination, President Chester A. Arthur pursued the investigation. A federal prosecution and trial took place in 1882, which was finally able to shut down the postal ring.

Although the fraudulent scheme was widespread, there were few convictions. Many of the defendants in the Star Routes trials were successfully defended by noted lawyer and orator, Robert Ingersoll. Public disgust over the Star Routes graft served as an impetus for civil service reform and the passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883.

==Post-abolition==
Star Routes, now known as Highway Contract Routes (or HCRs) as of 1970, have become a mode of delivering mail directly to customers. Historically, Highway Contract Routes were used rarely for mail delivery to households. An exception was in rural areas with less than one customer per mile.

In modern usage, HCRs can be used anywhere to deliver mail directly to customers. They are often used to deliver mail in growth areas such as new housing tracts. Some of these routes are being started in areas where there are as few as 20 deliveries per day.

Since 2000, the US Postal Service has added the term &quot;Contract Delivery Service&quot; (CDS) as their newest version of the Star Route. These routes are established to serve newly-created urban communities. CDS carriers do not transport mail, and are being used in an attempt to find delivery drivers who will work for less than USPS carrier wages. As of 2007, several thousand of these CDS routes have been created, with plans for far more.

Many contractors are no longer individuals wanting to transport mail between post offices, or to deliver mail in a remote community where they live. This new concentration of more urban contract routes has made it practical for businesses to bid on multiple contracts, and then seek workers who will work those routes for less money than the US Postal Service pays on each contract. The US Postal Service is still attempting to find an equilibrium between the dependability of career postal carriers and the cost savings of contractors acting as a temp agency.

There is some debate as to how much control the Postal Service can exercise over these contract routes and have them remain contractors. Exactly where the line is that will mark the difference between an HCR being a contractor and an employee is not clear.

<text>The Mitchell Caverns, within the Mitchell Caverns Natural Preserve, are three solution limestone caves, only two of which are open to the public, located on the east side of the Providence Mountains at an elevation of , within the Providence Mountains State Recreation Area. The caverns are located in the Mojave Desert, in San Bernardino County, California.

==Geology==
The caves lie within a thick sequence of marine Permian limestone. They were formed before the Pleistocene epoch, when ground water with a high carbonic acid content ate into the surrounding sedimentary limestone. Stalactites, stalagmites, and other cave formations were formed from calcium carbonate left by dripping mineral water.

==History==
Numerous paleontological and archaeological finds have been made in and around the caverns. Scientists have found the remains of several prehistoric animals, including a Shasta ground sloth. The caverns were a special place for the Chemehuevi Indians, and a number of tools and material culture have been found. The Chemehuevi knew the caves as &quot;the eyes of the mountain&quot; due to their easily spotted dual entrances located on the side of the mountain.

The caverns are named after Jack and Ida Mitchell, who owned and operated the caves from 1934 to 1954 as a tourist attraction and rest stop for travelers on nearby U.S. Route 66. The Mitchells also held mining rights to the area and dug several prospect holes and tunnels, some of which are still visible.

The area became a state park in 1956. The surrounding lands became a part of the National Park Service Mojave National Preserve in 1994, but the caves are still owned and operated by the state of California.

==Cavern tours==
The &quot;Tecopa&quot; and &quot;El Pakiva&quot; caves are connected by a man-made tunnel and are open to guided tours led by California State Park rangers. These caves are the only limestone caves in the California State Park system.

According to a California tourism guide, “You enter the limestone caverns at an altitude of about above the desert floor. The higher view of the desert from the Visitor Center is magnificent…Not too spacious, these chambers contain strangely beautiful cave coral, stalactites, and stalagmites.” 

;2011-2017 closure
In January 2011, due to California&#x27;s budget crisis, all tours were suspended and the Providence Mountains State Recreation Area closed. Vandalism plagued the caverns&#x27; visitor center and installations after their closure.

Over a long period, major infrastructure upgrades took place. Mitchell Caverns and Providence Mountains SRA reopened, and the caverns resumed tours, on November 3, 2017, after being closed for nearly seven years.

<doc id="1137482" wikidata="Q1297941" url="?curid=1137482" title="HMS Leopard (1790)">
<text>HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; was a 50-gun &quot;Portland class&quot; fourth rate of the Royal Navy. She served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was notable for the actions of her captain in 1807, which were emblematic of the tensions that later erupted in the War of 1812 between Britain and America. She was wrecked in 1814.

==Construction and commissioning==
She was first ordered on 16 October 1775, named on 13 November 1775 and laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard in January 1776. She was reordered in May 1785, ten years after having first been laid down, and construction began at Sheerness Dockyard on 7 May 1785. Work was at first overseen by Master Shipwright Martin Ware until December 1785, and after that, by John Nelson until March 1786, when William Rule took over. She was launched from Sheerness on 24 April 1790, and was completed by 26 May 1790. She was commissioned for service in June that year under her first commander, Captain John Blankett.

==Service==
The China fleet of East Indiamen left Macao on 21 March 1791. &quot;Leopard&quot; and escorted them as far as Java Head.

===French Revolutionary Wars===
On 24 October 1798, &quot;Leopard&quot; captured the French privateer vessel &quot;Apollon&quot;, which was under the command of Captain La Vaillant. On 22 August 1800 &quot;Leopard&quot; captured &quot;Clarice&quot;.

Because &quot;Leopard&quot; served in the navy&#x27;s Egyptian campaign (8 March – 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp &quot;Egypt&quot; to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants.
===Napoleonic Wars===
&quot;Leopard&quot; left Britain on 30 March 1806 as escort to a convoy that included , , , , and . During the night of 20 April &quot;Lady Burges&quot; wrecked on a reef off Boa Vista, Cape Verde. Boats from the convoy were able to rescue 150 of the 184 people on board; 34 or 38 drowned. &quot;Leopard&quot; left the convoy at Latitude 9°N, and arrived at Spithead on 8 June.

====The &quot;Chesapeake&quot;-&quot;Leopard&quot; affair====
In early 1807, a handful of British sailors—some of American birth—deserted their ships, which were then blockading French ships in Chesapeake Bay, and joined the crew of . In an attempt to recover the British deserters, Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, commanding &quot;Leopard&quot;, hailed &quot;Chesapeake&quot; and requested permission to search her. Commodore James Barron of &quot;Chesapeake&quot; refused and &quot;Leopard&quot; opened fire. Caught unprepared, Barron surrendered and Humphreys sent boarders to search for the deserters. The boarding party seized four deserters from the Royal Navy—three Americans and one British-born sailor—and took them to Halifax, where the British sailor, Jenkin Ratford, was hanged for desertion. The Americans were initially sentenced to 500 lashes, but had their sentence commuted; Britain also offered to return them to America.

The incident caused severe political repercussions in the United States, and nearly led to the two nations going to war.

&quot;Leopard&quot; escorted a convoy from Portsmouth on 6 May 1808. &quot;Leopard&quot; left the convoy on 28 July at .

She then was part of the convoy assigned to Josias Rowley in the Mauritius campaign of 1809–11 in the Indian Ocean.

==Fate==
In 1812, &quot;Leopard&quot; had her guns removed and was converted to a troopship. On 28 June 1814 she was en route from Britain to Quebec, carrying a contingent of 475 Scots Guardsmen, when she grounded on Anticosti Island in heavy fog. &quot;Leopard&quot; was destroyed, but all on board survived.

==&quot;Leopard&quot; in fiction==
In Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s novel &quot;Desolation Island&quot;, the fifth book of the Aubrey–Maturin series, Jack Aubrey commands &quot;Leopard&quot; on a cruise through the Atlantic and Indian oceans after the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;-&quot;Leopard&quot; Affair, a voyage which included the sinking of the fictional Dutch ship of the line &quot;Waakzaamheid&quot;, and a disastrous collision with an iceberg. In the sixth book, &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;, the ship is left at a British station in the Dutch East Indies, unable to support her complement of guns. She is called the &quot;horrible old &quot;Leopard&quot;&quot; in the fourth book in the series &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot;, and in other books in the series, and ends its days as a store ship sailing from the English Channel to the Baltic.

Game developer Lucas Pope based the layout of the titular ship in his game &quot;Return of the Obra Dinn&quot; on the layout of HMS &quot;Leopard&quot;.

<doc id="1137485" wikidata="Q43146480" url="?curid=1137485" title="PictoChat">
<text>is a LAN messenger service developed by Nintendo. It is preloaded on the Nintendo DS, Nintendo DS Lite and Nintendo DSi. Up to sixteen people can paint and/or text chat with each other using it, connected wirelessly through a LAN-only, system-to-system wireless connection. It allows for simple input of keyboard text and written text/drawings. &quot;PictoChat&quot; received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 2004 Japan Media Arts Festival.

== Functions ==

The Nintendo DS touch screen is used to type in letters with an on-screen keyboard or to draw and send pictures. Text can also be manually placed on the screen, if the user drags the selected character onto the message area. Messages sent from the DS or DS Lite appear in black, while DSi systems feature an additional &quot;rainbow&quot; pen. The pen tool offers small and large sizes. The keyboard provides enough Latin and kana glyphs to write in all languages supported by the system: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Japanese, plus Hungarian, Finnish, Portuguese and Dutch. The &quot;PictoChat&quot; system can only send messages in a radius of .

&quot;PictoChat&quot; displays the name and message managed in System Settings to all the users in the same chat room.

Four chat rooms (A, B, C &amp; D) are available at one time, each with a capacity of sixteen people, for a maximum of sixty-four people in total of all the chat rooms.

On the DSi versions of &quot;PictoChat&quot;, a rainbow pen can be used by tapping on the pen icon again once it has been selected. Content created using the rainbow pen can be read by &quot;PictoChat&quot; users on Nintendo DS Lite and original Nintendo DS systems. Additionally, the DS and DS Lite play a special sound when receiving a message written by a DSi user. The console plays a special sound and displays a special message when a user joins on their birthday.

=== Flip book creation ===
Flip books can be created for &quot;PictoChat&quot; by drawing a picture, sending it, copying it, modifying it slightly, and repeating the process. By pressing the R button, the user can return to the first image, then scroll through the images by pressing L+R to animate them. In 2009, this functionality was expanded into &quot;Flipnote Studio&quot; for the DSi, a free standalone animation program that allowed users to use a variety of brushes, animate on layers, and save and share the animations both as GIF images and via an online gallery. A successor, &quot;Flipnote Studio 3D&quot;, was later released for 3DS.
The Nintendo DS kanji-English-Japanese dictionary contains an extension to &quot;PictoChat&quot; that allows users to input kanji characters in addition to the standard character set. This version of &quot;PictoChat&quot; also vocalized roman characters and kana when they are input. This software is exclusive to Japan, and is the only type of &quot;PictoChat&quot; that can be used on Nintendo 3DS consoles without custom firmware.

== Reception ==
After seeing &quot;PictoChat&quot; at E3 2004, Ricardo Torres of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;one of the most interesting pieces of software on display&quot; for the system, though calling its interface &quot;bare bones&quot;. Ty Shugart of &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; expressed the view that it was &quot;a great tool for getting a feel for the DS&quot;, but hoped it would be included with the system, calling it not worth buying for more than a couple of dollars. In another preview, Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; called the software &quot;more for fun than functionality&quot;, and &quot;made for people in a classroom, or a plane&quot;, noting that &quot;it has its own charms&quot;. Rob Fahey of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called &quot;PictoChat&quot; &quot;a hit around these parts&quot; when writing an overview of the DS&#x27;s functions, noting that it worked extremely well even with a poor wireless signal.

&quot;Hyper&quot; magazine called &quot;PictoChat&quot; &quot;the highlight of the launch package&quot;, describing it as &quot;riotously good fun&quot;, and saying that the software would cause the system to be banned from classrooms within months of release.

== Prototype ==

A &quot;PictoChat&quot; prototype for the Nintendo DSi was shared in the Nintendo data leak. This prototype was never developed beyond a basic screen displaying the message &quot;Under Construction...&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Swapnote&quot; was seen as a successor to &quot;PictoChat&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, although it did not allow for instant messaging. It was shut down in 2013. &quot;Swapdoodle&quot;, a 2016 revision with tighter restrictions, did not gain popularity.

A stage based on &quot;PictoChat&quot; appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. Another stage called &quot;PictoChat 2&quot; appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot;, and is exclusive to the portable variant. An HD version of &quot;PictoChat 2&quot; returns in &quot;Ultimate&quot;.
