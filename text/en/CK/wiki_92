<doc id="1147165" wikidata="Q16182993" url="?curid=1147165" title="Kaworu Nagisa">
<text>, real name , is a fictional character from the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; franchise created by Gainax. In the series, he is the pilot of a giant mecha named Evangelion Unit 02 for the special agency Nerv. Kaworu is the seventeenth and final member of the Angels which threaten humanity. When he arrives at Nerv, he meets Eva-01 pilot Shinji Ikari, showing great affection towards him. After revealing his nature as an Angel to Shinji, he asks him to kill him to allow humanity to survive. Kaworu appears in the franchise&#x27;s animated feature films and related media, video games, the original net animation &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. He also has a prominent role in &quot;&quot;, the third film of the &quot;Rebuild&quot; saga.

The character, originally conceived by Gainax as a cat controlling a boy, was supposed to appear in the series&#x27; twenty-second episode. After several changes, director Hideaki Anno and screenwriter Akio Satsukawa decided on him being the last Angel, and he was included in the twenty-fourth episode.

Although Kaworu only appeared in one episode, he was popular with audiences and animation enthusiasts and topped popularity polls. Some critics disliked his ambiguity and the undertones of his relationship with Shinji; others praised his personality, finding him to be open, affectionate and sociable. His role in the film &quot;Evangelion 3.0&quot; also attracted the attention of critics, with reviewers generally appreciating his relationship with Shinji. Merchandise, particularly action figures, based on Kaworu have been released.

== Conception ==

Akio Satsukawa, a screenwriter who contributed to writing for the series&#x27; twenty-fourth episode, &quot;The Beginning and the End, or &#x27;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door, chose Kaworu&#x27;s name. He opted for the surname Nagisa (Japanese for &quot;shore&quot;) as a homage to Japanese director Nagisa Ōshima. The choice of a term related to the sea allowed him to connect to the names of other series&#x27; characters inspired by Imperial Japanese Navy ships and in the surname of Rei Ayanami. The name Kaworu was not written with the contemporary spelling with the katakana , but with the archaic character . The kanji was chosen for its connection with the katakana and the kanji , a detail referring to the Japanese title of the episode: . Satsukawa then created a pun with the phoneme &quot;shisha&quot;, which can mean or .

Two years before the series began broadcasting, Gainax published a presentation about the series entitled . Kaworu was originally going to appear in the twenty-second episode of the series as a &quot;&quot;bishōnen&quot; constantly accompanied by a cat&quot;. Nerv would have allowed the boy to enter its laboratories and, after a clash in which his fellow pilot Shinji Ikari found himself &quot;in the dilemma of having to fight against an anthropomorphic enemy&quot;, &quot;the greatest secret of the organization&quot; would be revealed.

In the first drafts, the Angel would have been a cat controlling a boy; however, this idea was abandoned, and elements of it were merged into Kaworu. In preliminary proposals, he had an organ characteristic of Angels named core and the ability to modify his appearance through metamorphosis, ideas which were set aside during the series&#x27; production. Anno conceived him as an &quot;ideal male&quot;; and according to him, &quot;The plan was that the &#x27;unconscious Shinji&#x27; would be Ayanami Rei, the Shinji who appears on the surface would be Ikari Shinji, and the &#x27;ideal Shinji&#x27; would be Nagisa Kaworu&quot;. Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto conceived him as &quot;more elegant and more refined&quot; than Shinji, and compared to him he would be &quot;taller, thinner and with a smaller face&quot;. For the somatic features of his face, he decided to combine those of Rei, Shinji, and Asuka Langley Soryu. Following a personal request from the director, colorist Harumi Takaboshi made his eyes red to be analogous with Rei&#x27;s and give him &quot;a distinct impression&quot;. In one of the drafts of the twenty-fourth episode, he is described as a blond-haired boy. Although he was conceived to appear only in the final episodes, during the making of the opening theme the main staff decided to depict him with a sketch by Sadamoto; in the editing phase, the sketch was inserted before a frame depicting Rei Ayanami and the caption &quot;Angels&quot;. While designing him, Sadamoto envisioned him with a &quot;younger&quot; voice than in the final version.

In the early stages of production, scriptwriter Akio Satsukawa wrote some drafts of the twenty-fourth episode&#x27;s script, in which Kaworu&#x27;s relationship with Shinji would have been expanded upon and presented with less ambiguity. Some of his ideas included Kaworu and Shinji swimming naked in a river at night, Kaworu proposing to Shinji to play piano and cello together and a kiss scene between them. Anno originally gave him an outline that Satsukawa greatly expanded upon, something that struck Sadamoto. Though Anno did not dissuade Satsukawa and the homoerotic tone of his draft, at one point he considered it &quot;above my tolerance level&quot;. The &quot;Evangelion&quot; staff and producers also rejected these proposals. Episode director and animator Masayuki refused to work on them and threatened to resign. The drafts underwent several modifications before being accepted as the definitive script. However, they did not change or alter the essence of Kaworu&#x27;s character; Anno said the draft&#x27;s &quot;atmosphere&quot; was preserved in the script. Anno explained he wanted to hold on to the idea of an Angel &quot;conversing in human language&quot;, mentioning it as a progression from Shinji&#x27;s conversation with the Angel Leliel in the sixteenth episode. He also considered expanding Kaworu&#x27;s role in the expanded director&#x27;s cut version of the episode, but decided to prioritize clarifying Kaworu&#x27;s connection to Seele instead.

Staff indicated they did not expect Kaworu to provoke a strong sexual impression, nor how popular he would become. They attributed their unawareness of this to the short time they had to produce the later episodes, and mentioned that Kaworu was not supposed to hold Shinji&#x27;s hand in the bath scene. This was an animation error; he was supposed to touch it instead. Like other characters in the series, Anno conceived Kaworu based on his own personality. He described Rei and Kaworu as part of his unconscious, and Kaworu specifically as his shadow—the dark and unconscious side of the psyche. According to some fans, he may have used Kunihiko Ikuhara, the director of the animated series &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and his friend, as a model. In an interview, Ikuhara denied the rumors, comparing Kaworu&#x27;s cynical personality to Anno himself, while stating he was not involved in the creation of the character. He also said he had close correspondence with Anno, with whom he was on good terms since the early design stages of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. During the production of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, the staff went on a trip to the spa, and Ikuhara chatted all night with Anno, who also worked as an animator for some of the series&#x27; episodes. When watching the episode, Ikuhara noticed how the situation with the bath was the same as the conversation he had with Anno.

=== Voice ===

Akira Ishida voices Kaworu Nagisa in his appearance in the original series, as well as the later films, spin-offs, video games, and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga. In 1997, when &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; was released, Ishida said he found the role &quot;very difficult&quot;, and felt &quot;a lot of pressure&quot; during the dubbing of the film version. His emotional tension grew exponentially when he learned that there would be two feature movies, but he was satisfied with his performance. During the recording of &quot;&quot; (2007), the first chapter of the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; cinematic tetralogy, Anno explained in detail the role played by Kaworu in the new theatrical version and his relationship with Shinji. During the dubbing sessions for &quot;&quot; (2012) he felt tense, but with the director&#x27;s support, he overcame his performance anxiety and reprised the role. For the final installment, &quot;&quot;, Ishida noted he had trouble saying the character&#x27;s &quot;complex&quot; lines.

In English, he is voiced by Kyle Sturdivant in the original series; Greg Ayres in the director&#x27;s cut version, Aaron Krohn in the 1997 film duology, Clifford Chapin in the Netflix&#x27; dub, Jerry Jewell in the first dub of &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; and Daman Mills in the Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s dub.

In the Netflix dub, one of Kaworu&#x27;s lines to Shinji was changed from ADV DVD&#x27;s &quot;I love you&quot; to &quot;I like you&quot;. This was a controversial choice among some fans, who felt it altered their relationship and contributed to queer erasure. Dan Kanemitsu, studio Khara&#x27;s in-house translator responsible for the updated &quot;Evangelion&quot; subtitles, production assistance, and other official Gainax and Khara translations, including the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, explained in an interview that he consults the original creator when the meaning is unclear or ambiguous. He defended the importance of ambiguity, citing Anno&#x27;s commentaries on &quot;Evangelion&quot;″s ambiguity and open-endedness, his commitment to accuracy, and conveying the text&#x27;s intended nuances across a cultural gap. Shinji&#x27;s voice actress, Megumi Ogata, also agreed with the translation for the Netflix/Khara release, saying she originally interpreted Kaworu&#x27;s lines as &quot;like&quot;, and that she is glad the new version is closer to the original Japanese version.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; ===
Kaworu appears in the twenty-fourth episode of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. A secret sect called Seele and a group called Commission for the Instrumentality of Mankind sent him to the headquarters of the special agency Nerv to carry out a mission as the Fifth Child and the replacement for Asuka Langley Soryu, who became unable to pilot Eva-02 following her breakdown. Soon after arriving in Tokyo-3, he meets with Shinji Ikari, who is the Third Child and Eva-01&#x27;s pilot. He befriends him, showing unconditional and sincere sympathy towards him. His position as a pilot allows him to enter Nerv, but Misato Katsuragi, a major in the organization&#x27;s operations department, becomes suspicious of him. He is subjected to a synchronicity test with Eva-02, and his high results astound the organization&#x27;s staff, since he can arbitrarily vary his rate of synchronization with the mecha. All data about his past is erased to conceal his true identity, but Misato discovers that he was born on September 13, 2000: the day the first of the Angels caused a calamity called the Second Impact to occur at the South Pole. He is revealed to be Tabris, the seventeenth Angel and the &quot;last sacrificial messenger&quot;, who has the soul of the first Angel, Adam, implanted in him. Seele, who captured Tabris when he was still in an embryonic state, &quot;recovered&quot; it. Unlike the other Angels, he can develop human-like feelings and communicate with them. Once in the headquarters, he comes into contact with Rei Ayanami, the pilot of Eva-00, in which the soul of another Angel is implanted, and confesses to her he is also a hybrid.

Using his Angel abilities, Kaworu manipulates the movements of Eva-02 to enter the Terminal Dogma of Nerv&#x27;s headquarters and contact the angel Adam, who is supposedly being guarded within the structure. Despite his anthropomorphic features, he possesses several anomalous abilities, including levitation and an AT Field, a powerful forcefield that is characteristic of Angels and Evangelions. Upon arriving at his destination, he discovers that the second Angel Lilith is being kept inside the base rather than Adam. Upon seeing Lilith, he interrupts his attempt at contact and decides to preserve her lineage, which humankind is descended from, rather than cause their extinction. He allows himself to be killed by Eva-01 and Shinji to allow humanity to survive.

In the ending film of the series, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion&quot; (1997), the souls of humanity unite into a collective consciousness, and during a process called Human Instrumentality, Shinji argues symbolically with Kaworu and Rei Ayanami. Akira Ishida said that the Kaworu who appears in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; is not real or concretely present; in the film, he and Rei say they represent the &quot;hope that people will one day be able to understand each other&quot;. He also appears when Gendo Ikari dies, along with Rei and Shinji&#x27;s mother Yui Ikari.

=== &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; ===
In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga, Kaworu has a prominent role and he is aware of details of Shinji&#x27;s life even before meeting him. He is introduced in the final sequence of the first film, &quot;Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone&quot; (2007), in which he awakens on the surface of the Moon to converse with a member of Seele. During the scene, he rises from a coffin placed on a lunar sea, with eight coffins next to him: four already open and four still closed. Behind him, a white giant is framed, similar to the Angel Lilith. He is completely naked, and somehow can breathe on the Moon. He addresses commander Gendo Ikari, who is visiting a place named Tabgha Base, as &quot;father&quot;. In &quot;&quot; (2009), the second installment of the saga, when Shinji tries to save Rei and unwittingly starts Third Impact, he descends aboard an Evangelion unit known as Mark.06. He stops the Third Impact, addressing Shinji with the phrase: &quot;At least this time I will be able to make you happy.&quot; Originally, Kaworu would have said the line with the light-hearted smile of the original series; however, during production it was decided to give him a troubled expression. Kazuya Tsurumaki, the assistant director of the original series and its movies, described him as a man who takes his wife back by force. He also said: &quot;[We thought it would be] more interesting if Kaworu looked like [he was thinking]: &#x27;You&#x27;ve been with a woman while I&#x27;ve been away? How dare you...!. Staff initially wanted to give him a &quot;showier entrance&quot;, and originally give him a scene talking to Asuka when Eva 03 is possessed the ninth Angel.

In the third movie, &quot;Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo&quot; (2012), set fourteen years after the previous film, he works for Nerv and is designated to pilot Eva-13 with Shinji on behalf of Gendo, who he calls &quot;king of Lillith&quot;. He shows Shinji, who is alone and scared of the new world, the consequences of his actions on planet Earth. Shinji is initially reluctant, but Kaworu offers him an opportunity to revert the damage done by Third Impact. To train, the two boys practice piano on the same &quot;a quatre mains&quot; musical base. Having reached good harmony, the two board Eva-13 and head to the Terminal Dogma of the Nerv base. Asuka and Mari Makinami confront them, but Kaworu falls for a trap set by Gendo and accidentally causes Shinji to start the Fourth Impact. He reveals he is the first Angel, but was demoted to thirteenth, and dies telling Shinji that &quot;We will meet again.&quot; Akira Ishida, Kaworu&#x27;s voice actor, was asked if the sequence of the two boys united in the same Evangelion could be interpreted as a &quot;love scene&quot;; Ishida replied he &quot;could not make that interpretation&quot;, and left it up to what the director said or the fans&#x27; speculation, saying: &quot;But, at the very least, them getting in the same unit is different, as they both pursue the same goal together. It seems representative of the depth of their connection.&quot;.

=== Manga ===
In the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; manga, written by the series&#x27; character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Kaworu is introduced in advance in a narrative arc roughly corresponding to the nineteenth episode of the series. In the 57th chapter of the comic, he meets Shinji in the ruins of a church during a piano solo. In his first appearance, he kills a stray cat in front of Shinji, arguing this would spare the cat further pain. He is later brought into Nerv to replace the Fourth Child, Toji Suzuhara, who died while fighting alongside Rei Ayanami against the Angel Armisael. His role as an Angel also changes, being presented as the twelfth instead of the seventeenth. In this version of events, Shinji has strong suspicions of the Fifth Child, and he accuses Kaworu of violating his personal space. Following Rei&#x27;s death, Shinji temporarily moves to his apartment, heartbroken by the loss he has just suffered. Shinji has a nightmare and starts to hyperventilate, and Kaworu uses this opportunity to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation by kissing Shinji, which angers him. Over time, their relationship becomes increasingly cold and tormented, until they take two different paths.

Unlike the original series, in which their relationship is ambiguous and up to speculation, for the manga Sadamoto changed Kaworu&#x27;s characterization, leaving less margin for interpretation. According to him, Kaworu feels &quot;a reflection of Rei&#x27;s feelings&quot; for Shinji, but he fails to understand them. Irritated by his behavior, after killing Kaworu, Shinji admits he felt &quot;drawn to him&quot;, but in the end rejects him &quot;because he is not Rei&quot;. Before his death, the Third Child imagines himself strangling Kaworu at the same time and place he met him. For this scene, the author took inspiration from the film &quot;Betty Blue&quot;, directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix, which is tormented story of two young lovers in which he ultimately strangles her out of love. Sadamoto created Kaworu to represent &quot;a situation in which Shinji has to confront liking someone&quot;; according to him, he is the person who understands Shinji the most. In an interview, Sadamoto compared his death to a &quot;contradictory &quot;fumi-e&quot;&quot;, an ancient Japanese ritual consisting of the trampling of Christian icons, in which Tabris would ask Shinji to prove he liked him by killing him. According to Sadamoto, in this particular moment of his life Shinji &quot;does not want the affection of a girl, but the approval of another boy&quot;. Unlike Hideaki Anno, who wanted to give Kaworu the image of an &quot;ideal man&quot;, Sadamoto, who believes that human beings are the last evolutionary stage of Angels, tried to represent him as a &quot;pre-human&quot;, who is innocent and naive. He was inspired by his own experiences, particularly by a classmate in elementary school who was a charming transfer student from Tokyo, and which he felt great admiration for. &quot;I secretly thought it was very cool. It was not romance ... It is a delicate feeling in a delicate age&quot;.

=== In other media ===
After the conclusion of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;″s first airing, a self-parody audio track written by Anno called &quot;After the End&quot; was released. On it the series&#x27; characters, played by their original voice actors, jokingly discuss and prepare a new ending just before the production schedule deadline, breaking the fourth wall. Kaworu appears; when Asuka calls him &quot;homoboy&quot;, he tells her, &quot;I wish you wouldn&#x27;t make statements when you lack evidence for them.&quot; Nagisa, along with Eva&#x27;s other pilots, joins a &quot;super sentai&quot;-style superhero group named &quot;Shin sentai Evangelion&quot;. In the movie &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth&quot; (1997) there are sequences in which four children from the third middle school of the city of Tokyo-2, with their respective instruments, practice a string quartet in the school&#x27;s auditorium. Among them is a violinist who looks like Kaworu; according to what is indicated by the superimposed writings, however, the event would take place eighteen months before his appearance in Tokyo-3. From the script, it is clear that, despite the similarity with the protagonists of the series, the four children should still be interpreted as actors in an imaginary sequence.

He appears in video games dedicated to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and is available as a romantic option in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion 2&quot;, and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot;. He&#x27;s also present in &quot;Raising Project&quot; manga adaptation as an agent sent by Seele at Ritsuko&#x27;s behest. In the manga &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days&quot; he knows Shinji&#x27;s father, Gendo, years before the main events without having changed his appearance. In the &quot;chibi&quot; parody series &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot; Kaworu is president of the school student council particularly popular among the students at his school who tends to protect Shinji, whom he loves. In the manga &quot;Evangelion – Detective Shinji Ikari&quot;, written by Takumi Yoshimura, Ryōji Kaji and Kaworu are portrayed as two private investigators to whom Shinji is forced to turn. In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse&quot;, his personality is similar to that of the original series. At the beginning of the manga, Kaworu is seen by Shinji near a vending machine running away from the scene of an explosion with Rei Ayanami, with whom he has an unspecified bond. Like the original series, he immediately shows great interest in Shinji, making him uncomfortable. He is also present in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Legend of the Piko Piko Middle School Students.&quot; Kaworu is one of the main characters of a &quot;pachinko&quot; entitled , released in Japan in April 2009. During the game, Nagisa intervenes during Operation Yashima against Ramiel with his Eva-04.

In addition to video games based on the original animated series, Kaworu has also appeared in media not related to the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise, such as &quot;Million Arthur&quot;, &quot;Hortensia Saga&quot;, &quot;Keri hime sweets&quot;, &quot;Summons Board&quot;, &quot;Divine Gate&quot;, &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, &quot;Final Gear&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Puyopuyo!! Quest&quot;., and &quot;The Battle Cats&quot;. Kaworu briefly assists Shinji in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Anima&quot;, also featuring a &quot;Dark Kaworu&quot; who hates humans and music; he is also present in the crossover franchise &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;.

== Characterization and themes ==
Kaworu is an erudite boy with an easy-going, straightforward and honest personality, particularly with Shinji Ikari. From the beginning, he shows great interest in Shinji, who is the first person he meets after arriving in Tokyo-3. Following the death, departure, or alienation of all his peers, Shinji is isolated until he meets Kaworu. However, Kaworu&#x27;s esoteric way of communicating confounds Shinji. Kaworu also shows great interest in humanity, describing their music, particularly the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, as the highest achievement of their culture, and often reflects on their fragility and nature. He is very direct in his interactions and seemingly does not know of or is interested in social conventions. He shows sympathy for Rei, who shares his hybrid nature. Kaworu seeks active contact with Shinji as a friend. Talking with Shinji, Kaworu says he thinks was &quot;born to meet him&quot;. Although Shinji emotionally distances himself from others, Kaworu helps him to open up and express his feelings. Kaworu shows he feels spontaneous sympathy and affection towards Shinji despite his goals as the seventeenth Angel. After they meet, Shinji accepts the friendly and unreserved nature of his actions and lets him approach. He captivates Shinji with his charm. Despite the short time they spend together, Kaworu and Shinji became interested in each other and build a relationship based upon mutual appreciation. Kaworu is the first person to tell Shinji he loves him and the first person that Shinji opens his heart to. When Kaworu takes over Eva-02, Shinji expresses disbelief in him not revealing his nature as an Angel before and says that Kaworu has betrayed him, &quot;just like my father&quot;. Shortly before dying, Kaworu maintains his feelings of affection for Shinji, saying that meeting him made him happy. After being forced to kill Kaworu, Shinji falls back into a state of profound affliction. As he is grieving, Misato fails to console Shinji.

Over time, controversies have arisen over the nature of Shinji and Kaworu&#x27;s relationship, as has the nature of Kaworu&#x27;s character. Their relationship is depicted in an ambiguously worded manner, as Kaworu uses the phrase to express his feelings for Shinji; it can be used to denote various types of intimacy or friendship to love. He also states that Shinji deserves . In his book &quot;Anime Explosion!&quot;, writer Patrick Drazen expresses the view that Kaworu&#x27;s offer of apparent love for Shinji is a tactic that he uses as the last Angel to disarm Shinji. Drazen reports that some believe that whether Kaworu as an Angel has any concept of sexuality is unclear because of the way he is presented in the series.

Lynzee Loveridge of Anime News Network interpreted Kaworu as a negative figure, saying that &quot;Kaworu&#x27;s kindness has a nefarious side&quot;, seeing him as an Angel who deceives and uses Shinji for his own purposes. For Mike Crandol he &quot;is representative of blind, total and unconditional love and acceptance, but like those things Kaoru turns out to not be real at all&quot;. Their colleague Zac Bertschy has a mixed opinion in his review of &quot;Rebuild 3.0&quot;. While not interpreting him as an antagonist or a negative figure, according to Bertschy, his presence demonstrates Shinji&#x27;s emotional fragility and the difficulty of his long path to self-acceptance. He describes Kaworu as a loving, considerate partner who cares deeply for Shinji&#x27;s happiness, refuses to leave him behind, and even takes Shinji&#x27;s terrible burden as his own; he notes: &quot;Shinji has misinterpreted Kaworu&#x27;s love not as evidence that he himself is worth loving and thus his motivation can be entirely his own, but that Kaworu&#x27;s love itself makes him worthwhile [...] But he&#x27;s still just fooling himself. He&#x27;s still making catastrophic decisions motivated by self-hatred – Kaworu&#x27;s love doesn&#x27;t make him a complete person.&quot;

Kentaro Takekuma, the editor of a book of interviews with &quot;Evangelion&quot; staff named &quot;Parano Evangelion&quot;, believes that for Shinji, Kaworu turns out to be the first friend he can trust and a homosexual romantic interest. Japanese scholar and writer Yūya Satō compared his role to that of the male characters of the &quot;yaoi&quot;, as well as that of the characters of the &quot;shōjo&quot; genre; for Sato, the appearance of Kaworu is more important on a thematic than narrative level, and would have the purpose of deepening the psychological aspects of Shinji. She compares his role to &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, where the process and the relational dynamics of the protagonists have more weight than the conclusion or the fights. &quot;Japanator&quot; writer Elliot Gay described Kaworu as a positive figure, as for Shinji he &quot;represents hope; the hope that maybe he can redo things&quot;. For Kunihiko Ikuhara, director of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and a friend of Hideaki Anno: &quot;Shinji is bullied by his father, slapped by Ayanami, called stupid by Asuka and Misato yells at him to behave like a man; he doesn&#x27;t receive much compassion from others, and I believe that in this situation the only one to tell him that it&#x27;s okay as it is, is Kaworu.&quot; Kotono Mitsuishi and Megumi Hayashibara, Japanese voice actresses of Misato Katsuragi and Rei Ayanami, compared the two to Orihime and Hikoboshi, two legendary lovers of the Japanese &quot;tanabata&quot; myth. Megumi Ogata, Shinji&#x27;s voice actress, rejected the notion of Kaworu as his lover, or that he is someone he can depend on, but instead sees him as a friend that is his equal. She pointed out that Shinji is more clingy in the original series, while in the &quot;Rebuild&quot; saga he has a more active role and his relationship with Kaworu is consequently different: &quot;I feel like, this time, it&#x27;s more than his attraction to Kaworu or what he learns from him – they&#x27;re depicted more as friends gradually closing the distance between each other.&quot;

In Apollonius of Tyana&#x27;s &quot;Nuctemeron&quot;, Tabris is the Angel of free will and freedom. In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, connecting to the Judeo-Christian tradition, Tabris chooses to be killed by Shinji, finding absolute freedom in death. Apollonius&#x27; &quot;Nuctemeron&quot; also mentions a demon named Cahor, spelled in Japanese as , referred to as the Angel of lies and deceit, a detail that guidebook &quot;Evangelion Chronicle&quot; relates to his deceptive anthropomorphic features. Writer Aaron Ploof compared Kaworu to Jesus Christ for his compassionate character and his sacrifice. Conversely, Carl Horn, editor of the &quot;Evangelion&quot; manga in English, compared his comic version to the character Satan in Mark Twain&#x27;s novella &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot;, for acting with indifference to human morality, while French website Du9 likened the image of Kaworu killed by Eva-01 to Francisco Goya&#x27;s &quot;Saturn Devouring His Son&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; also speculated that Kaworu is inspired by Satan, also known as Ryo Asuka, the main antagonist of Gō Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Devilman&quot;. According to Yūichirō Oguro, who curated contents of the home video editions of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, he presents affinities with Lalah Sune, a female character from the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; franchise. For Oguro, their relationship with the story&#x27;s male protagonist traces an analogy between the characters: both appear in the last episodes of the series and seem to be able to understand the feelings of the male main character, dying by his own hand.

Reviewer Toji Aida compared Kaworu to a ghost of the Noh theatre who disrupt the events of the story in the tripartite &quot;Jo-ha-kyū&quot; structure of the &quot;Rebuild&quot; series. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27;s Inkoo Kang also saw in his dialogues with Shinji, in which he tells him that all sins can be expiated, a reference to Christianity. Furthermore, in the &quot;Rebuild&quot; saga, Kaworu claims that his name is written on the , which would allow him to die and be reborn forever; he subsequently added to his name the name of Shinji, thus managing to meet him several times. According to critic Mario Pasqualini, the Book of Life cited by Kaworu is a reference to a concept of the same name in Christianity, according to which it is a text in which God would have listed in his hand the people destined to go to Heaven on the Last Judgment. The reviewer also compared the &quot;Rebuild&quot; to the science fiction movie &quot;Summer Vacation 1999&quot; (1988). The film introduces a character named Kaoru, a new student at a boys&#x27; boarding school who has a love affair with fellow student Kazuhiko. Kaoru turns out to be the reincarnation of Yū, a boy who died by suicide shortly before, who was resurrected to try to win Kazuhiko over, change the story, and give him a new ending.

== Cultural impact ==
=== Popularity ===
Despite his one-episode appearance, Kaworu became popular among the series&#x27; fans, and is just as popular as the female protagonists of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion,&quot; Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu. He ranked high in popularity polls about the best anime male characters, the strongest anime pilots, most memorable anime deaths and best Angels in &quot;Evangelion&quot;. In 1997 and 1998, Kaworu took second and sixth place among the most popular male characters of the moment in two polls conducted by &quot;Animage&quot; magazine. He also appeared in the monthly surveys of the magazine, remaining in the top twenty in 1997 polls. In 1998 &quot;Animage&quot; ranked him twenty-third among the most popular anime characters of the moment, and 43rd in 1999.

In August and September 2009, after the release of the &quot;Evangelion 2.0&quot; movie, he emerged in sixth and third place among the most popular characters of &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine; in October he ranked fourth. In March of the following year, &quot;Newtype&quot; included him among the most popular male characters of the 1990s, giving him second place after Shinji. In February 2015, nearly twenty years after the series first aired, he emerged seventh on &quot;Newtype&quot; charts. He also ranked in &quot;Evangelion&quot; popularity polls, usually in the top three. In June 2021, after the &quot;3.0+1.01&quot; re-release of the final &quot;Rebuild&quot; film, he finished second most popular male character in another &quot;Newtype&quot; poll.

=== Critical reception ===
Criticism of Kaworu&#x27;s character and his relationship with Shinji in the original series has been positive. According to the website Otaquest, detractors have labeled him as a &quot;yaoi fuel&quot;, &quot;while others see him as a vital piece of the &quot;Evangelion&quot; puzzle&quot;. For Caleb Bailey of Comic Book Resources the hot spring scene &quot;blazed the trail&quot; on homosexual relationships in Japanese animation, being &quot;ahead of its time&quot;. Anthony Gramuglia cited Shinji and Kaworu among the best queer representations in Japanese animation, but criticized Kaworu&#x27;s degrading role in some spin-offs.

LGBT-oriented portal Pride.com praised Kaworu and his relationship with Shinji, &quot;especially during a time where LGBTQ representation was almost nonexistent in many forms of media&quot;. Lyznee Loveridge of Anime News Network praised its development, finding it &quot;refreshing&quot;. Her colleague Kenneth Lee criticized Kaworu as &quot;an enigmatic figure that further adds fuel to the fire of confusion, but he just manages to raise even more questions that remain unanswered&quot;. Lee considers their relationship to be &quot;disturbing, gratuitous, and unnecessary&quot;. According to Lee, the openness Shinji shows towards Kaworu is implausible and &quot;irrational&quot;: &quot;Ultimately, the homosexuality issue seems nothing more than cheap shock value tactics to stun Generation X&quot;.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; and Comic Book Resources listed him among the best characters in the series. The twenty-fourth episode is considered one of the best of the series, and his fight with Shinji was also received positively by critics. For Comic Book Resources&#x27; Reuben Baron, in particular, his defeat is &quot;the most dramatic example&quot; of the narrative seriousness of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; later episodes. Screen Rant&#x27;s Jack Cameron feels his confrontation with Shinji is, &quot;Perhaps the most heartbreaking of fights in the whole series&quot;. Kaworu&#x27;s last scenes were also appreciated by anime critic Chris Beveridge. According to the Asiascape site, his last scene, in which he&#x27;s trapped in the hands of Shinji&#x27;s Eva-01 and marked by a long sixty-second freeze-frame, represents one of the more prominent uses of creative visual motifs in the series.

Carlo Santos of Anime News Network appreciated the character of Kaworu and the role he played in Sadamoto&#x27;s manga; he wrote, &quot;the tension between the two boys soon becomes one of the most intriguing subplots&quot;. Zac Bertschy, reviewing &quot;Evangelion 3.0&quot;, praised the development of their relationship, describing it as the film&#x27;s highlight. &quot;Anime Reign&quot; magazine expressed a similar opinion, considering it one of the few merits of characterization in the movie. Nicole MacLean of THEM Anime Reviews found Kaworu&#x27;s personality and relationship with Shinji in &quot;3.0&quot; effective, but wordy and rushed, while &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27;s Inkoo Kang considered Kaworu&#x27;s interactions with Shinji melodramatic.

=== Legacy ===
Kaworu Nagisa has been used for advertising campaigns and a wide range of merchandise, including action figures, nendoroids, backpacks, perfumes, sweets, cosmetics, clothing, toys, key rings, watches and jewelry.

On 22 May 1997, Kadokawa Shoten published a book dedicated to him entitled . In August of the same year, Japanese yaoi magazine &quot;June&quot; published a volume entitled , dedicated to Shinji and Kaworu. The book, whose title is taken from the first verse of the show&#x27;s theme song, contains two long interviews with Hideaki Anno, the discarded drafts for the twenty-fourth episode, and &quot;dojinshi&quot; by mangaka from the &quot;shonen ai&quot; scene, such as Reku Fuyanagi (&quot;Gundam Wing: Ground Zero&quot;) and Takamure Tamotsu (&quot;Umi ni nita sora no iro&quot;). In 2005, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the series release, mangaka Mine Yoshizaki designed an action figure of a female version of Angel Tabris named &quot;Tabris-XX&quot;. As a promotion for its 10th Anniversary Special Edition of &quot;Evangelion&quot;, ADV Films published a humorous bumper sticker which reads &quot;&quot;Kaworu died for your sins&quot;.&quot; Kaworu&#x27;s popularity is also parodied in a spin-off manga entitled , released in fourteen volumes from 2006 to 2015, in which a parody of him works in a &quot;pachinko&quot; parkour and dates an obsessive &quot;Evangelion&quot; female fan named Sakura Mogami.

In 2008 Kadokawa published a fanbook entitled &quot;All About Nagisa Kaworu: A Child of the Evangelion&quot;, a collection of fan letters, poems, reprinted manga pages, erotic &quot;dōjinshi&quot;, and interviews with gravure idols. In 2015 Kadokawa published a third book dedicated to him, entitled , containing unpublished illustrations, information and interviews with staff. In the same year the 7-Eleven chain put on the market a life-size statue of the character, auctioned and sold for over 1,728,000 Japanese yen. In 2017 the official &quot;Evangelion Store&quot; inaugurated a summer festival dedicated to Kaworu, offering unreleased merchandising. In 2018 it was used for features of the 500 &quot;Type Eva&quot;, a high-speed train dedicated to &quot;Evangelion&quot;. In 2019 Bandai announced a card game dedicated to &quot;Evangelion&quot; titled &quot;Evangelion Card Game&quot;; one of the two sets of the game, called Ev02, is dedicated to the characters of Kaworu and Asuka.

Tony Takezaki paid homage to him in his comic &quot;Tony Takezaki&#x27;s Evangelion&quot;, in which he is parodied by Keroro, the protagonist of &quot;Keroro Gunso&quot;. References and homages to the character of Kaworu are present in &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, and in the &quot;dorama&quot; &quot;The Full-Time Wife Escapist&quot;. Japanese singer and voice actress Chiaki Kuriyama stated that she developed interest in dubbing after Kaworu and Rei Ayanami. Comic Book Resources&#x27;s Kristen Lopez also compared Albedo from &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; to Kaworu, speculating that the latter character may have been an influence for the former.

<text>The Great Movie Ride was a dark ride located at Disney MGM Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, United States. Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, the attraction employed the use of Audio-Animatronic figures, practical sets, live actors, special effects, and projections to recreate iconic scenes from twelve classic films throughout motion picture history. The attraction—which debuted with the park on May 1, 1989—was located inside the park&#x27;s replica of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, one of Hollywood&#x27;s most famous movie palaces.

The Great Movie Ride was originally developed by Disney as a cinema-themed pavilion for the Future World section of Epcot. Under the direction of Michael Eisner and Marty Sklar, the concept was expanded into a new theme park devoted to motion pictures that included the dark ride as its centerpiece. To accurately represent a broad spectrum of American film, Disney also incorporated films from outside of its own library, mainly through its licensing agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and later Turner Entertainment. Turner subsidiary, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) sponsored the attraction for the final two years of its operation, with TCM film historian Robert Osborne serving as the attraction&#x27;s host during that time.

The Great Movie Ride closed on August 13, 2017, becoming the park&#x27;s last opening-day attraction to permanently close. The attraction was replaced by Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway, which still uses the Chinese Theatre replica.

==History==
The Great Movie Ride directly inspired the creation of Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. In a Walt Disney Imagineering book, it was revealed that The Great Movie Ride was originally planned as the main attraction in a show business themed pavilion at Epcot, which was to be called &quot;Great Moments at the Movies&quot;. However, the newly assigned Disney CEO Michael Eisner and WDI president Marty Sklar decided the idea was strong enough to lead an entire new theme park. The idea for the ride was expanded, and the Disney-MGM Studios went into official development. The attraction used the likenesses of numerous living and deceased actors to be recreated as audio-animatronics. Chad Everett provided the voice for John Wayne&#x27;s figure at the behest of Wayne&#x27;s family. Lee Marvin&#x27;s inebriated character of Kid Shelleen from &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; was planned to be included in the Western segment but was replaced with one of Clint Eastwood, as Marvin&#x27;s family believed that particular portrayal was inappropriate to showcase.

Plans called for The Great Movie Ride to be the main attraction for the Disney-MGM Studios Europe theme park, which was scrapped due to the early financial difficulties of the Euro Disneyland Resort. Years later when the resort began turning profits, a show business themed theme park went into development again, and the Walt Disney Studios Park opened in 2002 at the Disneyland Resort Paris, although minus The Great Movie Ride. A show called CinéMagique was built in lieu of the ride due to claims by Disney management that the French preferred shows to ride-through attractions.

Three separate attempts were made by Walt Disney Imagineering to bring The Great Movie Ride to California. First were plans to incorporate the attraction into the proposed “Disney-MGM Studio Backlot” project, a film studio themed retail and entertainment district that was planned (but ultimately never built) for downtown Burbank, California during the late 1980s. Several years later, plans called for the ride to serve as the centerpiece of the proposed Hollywoodland at Disneyland, which would have been added to the park during the planned Disney Decade in the 1990s. Due to budget cuts, however, Hollywoodland was canceled. Later, plans called for the ride to be built as part of the Hollywood Pictures Backlot area of the Disney California Adventure theme park at the Disneyland Resort. But budget cuts in the park&#x27;s original development planning forced the ride&#x27;s projected cost to be spent on smaller, original and less expensive attractions.

An early concept was supposed to be called Great Moments at the Movies, presented by Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. The Walt Disney Company and the retailer (then the largest in the world) announced a 10-year joint marketing and licensing agreement on November 19, 1987. Sears would sponsor the park&#x27;s signature attraction and a Hollywood Showcase Store. However, these plans were scrapped before the park&#x27;s opening. Coca-Cola stepped in as the attraction&#x27;s sponsor, and it became The Great Movie Ride to reflect it was a ride, not a movie, despite being housed in a replica of a famous movie theater. 

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Disney was interested in purchasing Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets. Walt Disney Imagineering developed a Muppet-themed land for Disney-MGM Studios called &quot;Muppet Studios&quot;. The land was to feature two main attractions; one was Muppet*Vision 3D and the other was &quot;The Great Muppet Movie Ride&quot;, a parody of The Great Movie Ride featuring Muppet characters such as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Gonzo re-enacting scenes from famous films such as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. However, after Henson died, the deal fell apart and Disney cut back on the Muppet-themed area to just Muppet*Vision 3D.

On the park&#x27;s opening day, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Roger Rabbit and other Disney characters placed their signatures, footprints, and handprints in front of the façade of the Great Movie Ride.

Unlike many Disney dark rides that feature separate embarkation and debarkation areas, the Great Movie Ride had only a single combined unloading and loading area. The last people to exit the vehicles often passed the next group of guests waiting to board the vehicles. At the time the ride was designed (the mid to late 1980s), it was common throughout the theme park industry to have all major rides exit into a store selling merchandise associated with the attraction. The Great Movie Ride, however, did not exit directly into a store and instead allowed guests to directly exit back outside into the park.

In 2014, as part of an exclusive programming deal with Disney, Turner Classic Movies agreed to become the sponsor of the attraction. The attraction underwent a refurbishment in 2015, with the addition of a new pre-show and post-show hosted by Robert Osborne, who also provided onboard narration to the ride. The changes were unveiled on May 29, 2015.

On July 15, 2017, it was announced that The Great Movie Ride would be permanently closed in order to make room for its replacement, Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway. The attraction had become outdated over the years as the animatronics were starting to age, in addition to Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios changing its theme from show business to popular Hollywood movies. Last rides were given at 9:30 PM on August 13. By the next morning, the signs were taken down and a photo opportunity of Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway was installed near the former exit.

There are three references in Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway that pay tribute to The Great Movie Ride. A poster that says &quot;The Great Moving Ride&quot; can be found in the carnival scene between Horace&#x27;s popcorn stand and Donald&#x27;s hot dog stand. The tornado scene contains a mailbox with the iconic &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; quote. Prior to the factory scene, an alley cat sound effect can be heard in the back alley which was also used in The Great Movie Ride.

===Modifications===
====&quot;Footlight Parade&quot;====
The first sequence of the ride, &quot;Footlight Parade,&quot; was plagued with engineering and technical problems from the beginning. When the ride was newly opened, the Footlight Parade segment was different from what it later became. The entire portion following the neon lighted entrance was fleshed out. All the walls leading up to, around, and beyond the &quot;cake&quot; were painted in art deco style patterns as seen in &quot;By A Waterfall&quot;. Approximately three &quot;diving boards&quot; with three mannequin &quot;dancers&quot; wearing capes were perched on the right-hand side of the wall as you enter the ride segment. The five-tiered &quot;cake&quot; was prominently displayed at a left-hand turn. It was in the open air illuminated with an array of animated lights. During this pass through the Footlight Parade segment, riders would hear a &quot;loop&quot; of &quot;By A Waterfall&quot; (a song featured in &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;) lasting approximately 40 seconds as bubbles fall from the ceiling.

For approximately the first year, the &quot;cake&quot; actually rotated and was adorned with water jets as seen in the film. Allegedly, the rotating &quot;cake&quot; mechanism was constantly breaking down, causing frequent repairs and downtime. In addition, the water pumps would constantly fail, flooding the ride path. Park operations believed it was much cheaper and less problematic to leave the &quot;cake&quot; in place with lighting effects used to provide what Imagineers term as &quot;kinetics&quot; to the segment.

When it closed, this segment was still the &quot;opening act&quot; of The Great Movie Ride, but significantly toned down. The guests entered a segment with its lighting significantly diminished. The outer walls were dark with practically no art deco recreations from the film set. The &quot;diving boards&quot; had been replaced with art deco style wall sconces. Instead, guests passed through a deco inspired archway to find themselves facing a large scrim-lined proscenium decorated with gray/blue clouds and remnants of the art deco set designs. Throughout the segment, three large rotating projections of Busby Berkeley-style kaleidoscope dance sequences appeared on the scrim (from &quot;By A Waterfall,&quot; &quot;Dames,&quot; and &quot;Shadow Waltz&quot;). These disappeared to expose the &quot;cake,&quot; which was behind the scrim and was simultaneously illuminated with washes of light and reflective water effects. The caped dancers on diving boards were located to the far left of the &quot;cake&quot; behind the scrim. The art deco style wall panels still resided behind the &quot;cake&quot;. The looping song segment and bubbles remained.

====&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;====
&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; scene did not have major structural changes, but Imagineering replaced the original A-100 Wicked Witch audio-animatronic character with a newer-design figure utilizing Sarcos technology. The Sarcos-equipped audio-animatronics are capable of a great deal more movement possibilities than the original &quot;limited animation&quot; figure designs and can move much more quickly. As a result, they were made much more lifelike.

==Attraction==

===Theater facade===

The Great Movie Ride was located inside a recreation of the famous Hollywood landmark, Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. The park&#x27;s Chinese Theatre is a full-scale replica of the original building; Imagineers used the original building&#x27;s 1927 blueprints in the construction of the park&#x27;s theatre. At the time the attraction opened, the actual theater&#x27;s name was &quot;Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre&quot; and later &quot;Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre&quot;, however, the park&#x27;s proper name for this version of the building is simply &quot;The Chinese Theater&quot;. From 2001 to 2015, the theatre façade was obscured from view (when looking from the park&#x27;s entrance), when the Sorcerer&#x27;s Hat was situated directly in front of the attraction. The Chinese Theatre facade and courtyard remained after the attraction&#x27;s closure and was retained for Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway.

===Queue===

The line wound through a recreation of the Chinese Theatre lobby past glass display cases containing actual costumes, props, and set pieces from various films. The lobby also featured digital posters of various motion pictures. The line then took guests into a small pre-show theatre where Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne provided insight and commentary about various motion pictures and film genres—such as musicals, adventure, science-fiction, westerns, romance, and gangster films— including those films that were featured within the ride. The queue line ended at a pair of automatic doors at the front of the theatre that lead into a 1930s era Hollywood soundstage where guests were loaded onto waiting ride vehicles.

===Ride experience===
As the guests reach the end of the queue, they entered a 1930s-era Hollywood sound stage where they become loaded by cast members into one of two pairs of open, theatre-style seating ride vehicles. The ride vehicles utilize a &quot;traveling theatre&quot;-style automated guided vehicle ride system similar to the former Universe of Energy attraction at Epcot. However, here the ride vehicles are much smaller in size, are grouped together in pairs of two, and feature an open cab in the first row of the front vehicle for a live tour guide to stand, provide narration, and operate the ride vehicle. Earlier and later in the day, only the second pair of ride vehicles (#2B) are used as the first pair of ride vehicles (#1A) are only used during the busier times of day.

The film set within the soundstage features a large neon theatre marquee and a cyclorama of the 1930s-era Hollywood Hills complete with the original Hollywoodland Sign. As the ride begins, the song &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot; plays overhead as the vehicles&#x27; tour guide welcomes the guests and introduces Osborne, who informs them (via onboard narration) that they will be taken through scenes from different classic films throughout history.

The first genre of films introduced are musicals, which begins with a cake of starlets from &quot;By a Waterfall&quot; from Busby Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;. The next musical scenes include audio-animatronic figures of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) swinging from a lamp post from &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain, &quot;followed by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) singing on the rooftops of London from &quot;Mary Poppins.&quot;

The next scene is a tribute to gangster films. The ride vehicle passes through the dark and seedy backstreets of a 1930s Chicago and past an audio-animatronic Tom Powers (James Cagney) in a scene from &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;. When both pairs of ride vehicles are in use, the #1A ride vehicle continues on to the next show scene past a green traffic light above a tunnel entrance while the #2B ride vehicle is stopped when the traffic light changes to red. While stopped, a live gangster named Mugsy (Boy) or Mugsi (Girl) and their audio-animatronic companions Squid and Beans show up and get involved in a shoot-out with rival mobsters (Brains, Legs, and Weasel) in a car on the opposite side of the street where the ride vehicle is stopped. During the shootout, the live gangster then chases the tour guide and hijacks the ride vehicle.

Next, the ride vehicle enters into a tribute to the Western genre. Here, the guests encounter audio-animatronics of the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) standing outside of a saloon and Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) sitting atop his horse. A sign on one building facade reads “Ransom Stoddard Attorney-at-Law” (James Stewart). The #2B ride vehicle (which is already being driven by the gangster) continues past a shootout between the town sheriff and an audio-animatronic bank robber named Snake. The gangster ignores the shootout and continues on to the next scene. However, the #1A ride vehicle (which is still being driven by the tour guide) stops in front of the town bank while a bank robbery is in progress. Suddenly, a live bank robber named Kate Durango (Girl) or Kid Carson (Boy) appears from inside the bank. After getting into a shoot-out with the town sheriff and chasing the tour guide into the bank, the bandit sets the town bank ablaze with dynamite and hijacks the ride vehicle. Following this scene, the remainder of the attraction is the same for both the #1A and #2B ride vehicles.

Next, the ride vehicle continues into a darkened corridor of a seemingly abandoned spaceship, revealing itself to be the &quot;Nostromo,&quot; the doomed vessel from &quot;Alien. &quot;The ride vehicle passes an audio-animatronic Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) holding a flamethrower as she prepares to confront a creature lurking within the ship. Guests could also hear Jones, Ripley&#x27;s pet cat, meowing in the darkness, as well as the &quot;Nostromo&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Mother&quot; computer warning of an imminent ship self-destruction countdown. Hearing this, the gangster or the bandit becomes nervous and speeds the ride vehicle through the ship, but not before the Alien appears and attacks the guests, popping out from both the ceiling and the wall.

The ride vehicle next enters a scene set in an ancient Egyptian tomb filled with snakes. Osborne informs the guests that they are in a scene from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; as audio-animatronic figures of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) struggle to lift the Ark of the Covenant. A second room within the temple features a large altar in the form of the ancient Egyptian god Anubis. Near the top of the altar, a large priceless jewel is being watched over by a cloaked temple guard. The gangster or the bandit sees the jewel, stops the ride vehicle, and disembarkes to take it. Before touching the jewel, the temple guard gives a warning that those who disturb the treasure of the gods must pay with their life. Ignoring the warning, the gangster or the bandit reaches to grab the jewel. Suddenly, a plume of fiery smoke shoots from the ground engulfing the temple altar (as the temple guard leaves, undressing to reveal that the temple guard is the original tour guide while doing so before reappearing from the shadows). When the smoke clears out, the skeletal corpse of the Gangster or Bandit is revealed and the tour guide reboards the ride vehicle and continues on with the show.

The next film genre introduced are horror films as the ride vehicle goes through an ancient burial chamber full of mummies, some of which have come to life. The ride vehicle soon departs the tomb and enters a dense jungle. Here, audio-animatronic figures of Tarzan (Johnny Weissmuller) swinging on a vine, Jane (Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan) sitting atop Timba the elephant, and Cheeta the chimpanzee can be seen. The ride vehicle then moves past the final scene from &quot;Casablanca,&quot; featuring audio-animatronics of Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) as they stand in front of a waiting airplane. Next, the ride vehicle passes a film projection of Mickey Mouse in his role as the Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice from the 1940 Walt Disney&#x27;s animated film, &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

The ride vehicle then enters into the Munchkinland scene from &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; where Dorothy&#x27;s house has landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. When both the #1A and #2B ride vehicles are in use, they meet up here and come to a stop in the middle of the scene. Audio-Animatronic Munchkins begin to appear from various places and sing as they welcome guests to their home. However, a plume of smoke suddenly rises from the ground as an audio-animatronic Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) appears and asks who is responsible for killing the Wicked Witch of the East. The tour guide aboard the #1A ride vehicle briefly interacts with her before she disappears in another puff of smoke. The Munchkins reappear from their hiding places and begin to sing again as both ride vehicles follow the Yellow Brick Road out of Munchkinland past audio-animatronic figures of Dorothy (Judy Garland), Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin Man (Jack Haley), Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) and Toto (Terry) standing in front of the Emerald City, and onto the ride&#x27;s grand finale.

For the grand finale, when both the #1A and #2B ride vehicles are in use, they both enter a dark theatre where they line up side by side and come to a stop in front of a large movie screen. There, Osborne or the tour guide concludes the tour with a three-minute film montage of classic film moments. At the conclusion of the film, the tour guide, who is applauded by the guests, declares the tour a success, and both ride vehicles exit the theater in single file to return to the 1930s soundstage, where the ride concludes.

==Films represented==
===Licensing rights===
Disney arranged separate licensing deals with various studios to represent the different characters and settings featured in the attraction. Most of the non-Disney films represented in &quot;The Great Movie Ride&quot; were produced by and/or owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer when the ride&#x27;s operation began. In 1985, Disney and MGM entered into a licensing contract that gave Disney worldwide rights to use the MGM name and logo for what would become Disney-MGM Studios (now known as Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios), while separate contracts were used for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot; and &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; to give these films representation in The Great Movie Ride. Disney&#x27;s license for the aforementioned films continued with Turner Entertainment until the attraction&#x27;s closure.

The Great Movie Ride also included &quot;Alien&quot;, owned by 20th Century Fox, as Disney originally acquired the licensing rights to the film for a different attraction, which was ultimately cancelled. Disney, however, retained the rights to use &quot;Alien&quot; and decided to incorporate it into the Great Movie Ride. In addition to Fox, scenes from almost all of the major film studios were presented in the film montage with one notable exception; there was no reference to any motion picture released by Universal Pictures, whose parent company operates the rival Universal Orlando Resort, although &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot;, which was produced by Miramax and distributed by Universal internationally, was featured in the montage.

<text>Andrew Lam (born 1964) is a Vietnamese American author and journalist who has written about the Overseas Vietnamese experience.

==Biography==
Andrew Lam was born Lâm Quang Dũng in 1964 in South Vietnam. He was the son of General Lâm Quang Thi of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. He attended Lycée Yersin in Đà Lạt.

Lam left Vietnam with his family during the fall of Saigon in April 1975. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in biochemistry. He soon abandoned plans for medical school and entered a creative writing program at San Francisco State University. While still in school he began writing for Pacific News Service and in 1993 won the Outstanding Young Journalist Award from the Society of Professional Journalists.

A PBS documentary produced by WETA in 2004, &quot;My Journey Home&quot;, told 3 stories of Americans returning to their ancestral homelands, including of Lam&#x27;s return to Vietnam.

He is currently the web editor of New America Media. He is also a journalist and short story writer. In 2005, he published a collection of essays, &quot;Perfume Dreams&quot;, about the problem of identity as a Vietnamese living in the U.S. Lam received the PEN/Beyond Margins Award in 2006 for &quot;Perfume Dreams: Reflections on the Vietnamese Diaspora.&quot; He is a regular contributor to National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. His second book, &quot;East Eats West: Writing in Two Hemispheres&quot; is a meditation on east–west relations, and how Asian immigration changed the West. It was named Top Ten Indies by Shelf Unbound Magazine in 2010.

&quot;Birds of Paradise Lost&quot;, his third book, is a collection of short stories about Vietnamese newcomers struggling to remake their lives in the San Francisco Bay after a long, painful exodus from Vietnam.

Lam blogs regularly on Huffington Post.

He was a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University 2001–2002.

Though reticent about speaking about his sexuality, in 2009 Lam gave an interview for a collection of portraits of homosexual Americans.

<doc id="1147187" wikidata="Q4878939" url="?curid=1147187" title="Bed (album)">
<text>Bed is the third solo album by American singer-songwriter Juliana Hatfield, released in 1998 by Zoë Records.

==Recording==
&quot;Bed&quot; was written in a few weeks, and recorded and mixed from March 9 to March 15, 1998, at Sound Station Seven in Providence, Rhode Island. Hatfield chose to record the album with a stripped-down sound and did not favor any digital processing effects. According to her, &quot;I had just been listening to things that were very raw and dry, the kind of things where you can really hear all the instruments very close to your ear when you have headphones on. I guess I was feeling raw, and I didn&#x27;t want to pretty it up or put anything on top of it.&quot;

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, reviewer Brett Milano praised the album, stating that its songs have more depth than Hatfield&#x27;s earlier MTV hits. Although he admitted that some tracks sounded a bit rushed, he felt that the album has enough gems to keep it interesting.

<doc id="1147192" wikidata="Q519693" url="?curid=1147192" title="Vernon Duke">
<text>Vernon Duke ( 16 January 1969) was a Russian-born American composer and songwriter who also wrote under his birth name, Vladimir Dukelsky. He is best known for &quot;Taking a Chance on Love,&quot; with lyrics by Ted Fetter and John Latouche (1940), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started,&quot; with lyrics by Ira Gershwin (1936), &quot;April in Paris,&quot; with lyrics by E. Y. (&quot;Yip&quot;) Harburg (1932), and &quot;What Is There To Say,&quot; for the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; of 1934, also with Harburg. He wrote the words and music for &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; (1934) for the revue &quot;Thumbs Up!&quot; In his book, &quot;American Popular Song, The Great Innovators 1900-1950&quot;, composer Alec Wilder praises this song, writing, “The verse may be the most ambitious I’ve ever seen.&quot; Duke also collaborated with lyricists Johnny Mercer, Ogden Nash, and Sammy Cahn.

==Early life==
Vladimir Aleksandrovich Dukelsky (Russian: Владимир Александрович Дукельский) was born in 1903 into a Belarusian noble family in the village of Parfyanovka, Pskov Governorate, Russian Empire. His family was of the small gentry class; the 1954 &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; referred to his paternal grandmother, née Princess Tumanishvili, as having been &quot;directly descended from the kings of Georgia&quot;. According to Duke, his mother also had some Austrian and Spanish ancestry. The &quot;Jewish Standard&quot; lists him among Jewish musicians, for reasons unknown; Composer Jack Gottlieb denies this claim.

The Dukelskys resided in Kiev, and Vladimir&#x27;s only visit to Saint Petersburg and Moscow occurred in the summer of 1915. The impressions of that summer were later echoed in Dukelsky&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The End of St. Petersburg&quot; (1931–37). The title is a reference to the film The End of St. Petersburg, directed by Vsevolod Pudovkin. 

At the age of eleven, Dukelsky was admitted to the Kiev Conservatory, where he studied composition with Reinhold Glière and musical theory with Boleslav Yavorsky. In 1919, his family escaped from the turmoil of civil war in Russia and spent a year and a half with other refugees in Constantinople. In 1921, they obtained American visas and sailed steerage class on the SS &quot;King Alexander&quot; to New York.

He underwent his immigration inspection at Ellis Island. On the passenger list, the purser of the &quot;King Alexander&quot; recorded his name as &quot;Vladimir Doukelsky,&quot; in the French fashion. In 1922 in New York, George Gershwin befriended the young immigrant. Gershwin (born Jacob Gershwine) suggested that Dukelsky truncate and Americanize his surname, taking Vernon as his given name. Dukelsky&#x27;s first songs published under his pen name were conceived that year, but he continued to write classical music and Russian poetry under his birth name until 1955.

==Career==
In 1924, Dukelsky returned to Europe. In Paris, he received a commission from Serge Diaghilev to compose a ballet. Dukelsky&#x27;s first theatrical production, &quot;Zephyr and Flora&quot;, was staged in the 1925 season of Ballets Russes, with choreography by Léonide Massine and scenography by Georges Braque, to great critical acclaim. In a review of musical novelties of the season, Sergei Prokofiev described it as full of &quot;superior melodies, very well designed, harmonically beautiful and not too &#x27;modernist&#x27;.&quot; Prokofiev was as impressed with the young talent as Diaghilev was, and soon the composers became close friends. They frequently saw each other until Prokofiev returned to the Soviet Union in 1938; they continued to correspond until 1946. Dukelsky&#x27;s First Symphony was premiered by Serge Koussevitzky and his orchestra in 1928 in Paris on the same bill as excerpts from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;. Some of Dukelsky&#x27;s and Prokofiev&#x27;s compositions of the 1930s bear evidence of their musical dialogue.

In the late 1920s, Dukelsky divided his time between Paris, where his more classical works were performed, and London, where he composed numbers for musical comedies under his pen name Vernon Duke. In 1929, he returned to the United States with the intention of settling in the country permanently. He composed and published much serious music, but devoted greater efforts to establishing himself on Broadway. Duke&#x27;s songs &quot;April in Paris&quot; (1932), &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; (1934), &quot;I Like the Likes of You&quot; (1934), &quot;Water Under the Bridge&quot; (1934), and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot; (1936) were 1930s hits.

The support and devotion of Serge Koussevitzky, who published Dukelsky&#x27;s chamber music and conducted his orchestral scores, helped him develop his classical works. Dukelsky&#x27;s concerto for piano, orchestra, and soprano obbligato, titled &quot;Dédicaces&quot; (1935–1937), was premièred by Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra in January 1939 in New York. His oratorio, &quot;The End of St. Petersburg&quot;, was premiered a year earlier by Schola Cantorum and the New York Philharmonic under Hugh Ross. In 1937, the composer was asked to complete Gershwin&#x27;s last score, a soundtrack to a Technicolor extravaganza &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot;, to which he contributed two parody ballets choreographed by George Balanchine, and the song &quot;Spring Again&quot;. In 1939, Dukelsky became an American citizen and took Vernon Duke as his legal name. Duke&#x27;s greatest success came a year later, with the Broadway musical &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (1940), choreographed by George Balanchine and performed by an all-black cast at the Martin Beck Theater in New York.

===Military service===
Between 1942 and 1944, he served in the US Coast Guard. While in service, he discovered Sid Caesar, a saxophone player in the Coast Guard Band, and wrote a touring show for the Coast Guard called &quot;Tars &amp; Spars&quot;. He also conceived some of his finest music in the classical tradition, including a Cello Concerto (commissioned by Gregor Piatigorsky) and a Violin Concerto.

===Third Symphony===
His Third Symphony (1946) was dedicated to the memory of Koussevitzky&#x27;s wife, Natalie. Over the years, Serge and Natalie Koussevitzky, Dukelsky&#x27;s devoted supporters, had become his surrogate family. When Dukelsky&#x27;s mother died, in 1942, the composer took the conductor&#x27;s refusal to commission the work with great bitterness. The dedication was revoked and the relationship soured.

In 1946, Duke left the United States for France, where he continued his double career of being a classical composer and a songwriter (now setting to music the texts of French lyricists). By 1948, the composer was back in America. He moved from New York to California, where he spent his last decades writing songs, film and theater scores, chamber music, poetry in Russian and polemical articles and memoirs in English. On October 30, 1957, he married singer Kay McCracken. His final appearance on Broadway came less than two weeks later with the two songs and incidental music he wrote for the Helen Hayes show, Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Time Remembered&quot; (1940) (French title: &quot;Léocadia&quot;) which ran for 247 performances. He continued to try to mount Broadway musicals during the last decade of his life, including two shows that closed during tryouts, and one that was never produced.

===Later works===
As a classical composer, Dukelsky used the same musical language as his modernist contemporaries Sergei Prokofiev, Arthur Lourié, and, to a lesser extent, Igor Stravinsky. His harmonies, however, were highly original. As a songwriter and author of theatrical and film music, his work was close to that of George Gershwin and Harold Arlen, but he developed an idiosyncratic voice of his own.

==Death==
Duke died in Santa Monica, California on 16 January 1969, during surgery for lung cancer. His numerous papers—musical and literary manuscripts and correspondence in English, French, and Russian—are stored in the Musical Division of the Library of Congress.

<text>Panteón de Belén (also Santa Paula Cemetery) is a historic cemetery located in Guadalajara, Mexico. The cemetery is a site of legends and night tours. It opened in 1848 and was formally closed for burials in 1896. It remains open to the public for both daytime and evening tours.

== History ==

Until the construction of the Rotonda de los Jaliscienses Ilustres the cemetery housed the memorial for major historic figures from Jalisco. Its original name was Santa Paula Cemetery and it was a project by Fray Antonio Alcalde. Guadalajara suffered of a large number of epidemics and the conventional hospitals were unable to support the demand for medical attention.

In 1737, the Spanish crown requested to the Oidor Marqués de Altamira Don Juan Rodríguez de Albuerne, information about the number of patients at the Betlemitas Hospital. On March 8, 1751, the crown granted permission to relocate the hospital. King Ferdinand VI requested the blueprints and granted funds to build a new hospital.

Guadalajara faced a large famine in 1786 (Año del hambre). The old hospital was not large enough to treat the number of patients.

On May 3, 1793 the Hospital of Belén was inaugurated.

After the Independence War, Guadalajara faced a large number of famines and epidemic diseases like in 1833. Cholera killed a large percentage of the population.

Guadalajara required a new cemetery outside the populated areas. The land used for the hospital&#x27;s orchards were given to build the cemetery, which is why it is commonly known as the &quot;Panteon de Belen&quot;.

The cemetery was constructed by the architect Manuel Gómez Ibarra in 1848, on solicitation from Bishop Diego de Arana y Carpinteiro.

The Panteon de Belen was divided in 2 areas. The common area and the section reserved to the wealthy.

Santa Paula Cemetery received this name because the chapel in the middle of the high-class part of the cemetery was dedicated to her. Under the chapel there&#x27;s a mausoleum where the remains of the most important figures in the city&#x27;s history were kept until 1957, when all the remains interred there were transferred to a new area known as the Rotonda de los Jaliscienses Ilustres.

The common area has disappeared and was turned into the Tower of Medical Specialities for the Hospital (Now Called The &quot;Old&quot; Civilian Hospital and owned by the University of Guadalajara); but the wealthy part was re-opened and many legends were created to draw attention to it as some sort of &quot;museum of the macabre&quot;.

== Legends ==
Legends of: The Vampire, The Pirate, The Lovers, The Monk, The Child afraid of the Dark, The Story of José Cuervo, The Nun and many more, have surfaced and are part of the local folklore.

Many ghost sightings have been recorded but some think is just some form of mass-hysteria, still the Mexican cultural attraction to the dead draws dozens of people to the daytime and nighttime tours, especially on November 2.

Fen-om, a non-profit organization dedicated to sharing facts of Mexican culture, focuses on the Panteón de Belén as part of quarterly tours of the city of Guadalajara. Many of the traditional tales of the graveyard can be found as part of the itinerary of its 7-day-a-week tours.

<text>The Whanganui National Park is a national park located in the North Island of New Zealand. Established in 1986, it covers an area of 742 km2 bordering the Whanganui River. It incorporates areas of Crown land, former state forest and a number of former reserves. The river itself is not part of the park, but is a popular paddling route titled the Whanganui Journey, one of New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Great Walks&quot;. The New Zealand Department of Conservation highlights Whanganui National Park as being the National Park most closely tied to human settlement.

== History ==

=== Use by Māori ===
The Whanganui river was a major trade and communication route for Māori, and would have been the main route into the central North Island. The river was once home to a network of pā alongside the river banks throughout what is now the Whanganui National Park. This was called ‘the plaited rope of Hinengākau’, named for a Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi ancestor. 

The mid to late 19th century also saw the growing of wheat, and between the 1840s and 1860s flour mills were built to process this into flour that could be traded.

=== Early Pākehā ===
After the arrival of European settlers, Whanganui played a significant role for both Māori and European religious communities. In the 1840s there was widespread conversion to Christianity, which led to the establishment of Christian communities and building of chapels along the river. Likewise this area was also visited by followers of the Pai Marire religion who had settlements nearby.

== Notable Features ==

=== Bridge to Nowhere ===
The Bridge to Nowhere is a steel-reinforced concrete bridge, dating back to early 20th century European settlement in the area. From 1917 onwards, the New Zealand government offered retired serviceman returning from World War 1 discounted land, and loans for development, as part of the Soldier-Settler Scheme. This included land within the Mangapurua and Kaiwhakauka valleys within what is now the park. In 1919 a wooden swing bridge was constructed, which was replaced with a reinforced steel bridge in 1936. At the most populous point there were 30 farms in Mangapurua and 16 in Kaiwhakauka, however by 1942 only three farmers remained, and two years later the area was unpopulated. This decline was due in part to hardships of the land, including flooding and erosion, problems also experienced by Soldier-Settler Scheme recipients elsewhere. Today the bridge is used by park visitors and maintained by the Department of Conservation.

=== Tīeke Marae/Kāinga ===
The Tīeke Marae/Kāinga is a Department of Conservation hut and marae on the Whanganui Journey Great Walk. The buildings are situated near the Western border of the park, across the river from Parinui. The area upon which they are situated was the site of Māori communities at the time of European colonization, with contemporary European accounts recording the population of Tīeke to be 260 in 1847. The marae was established in the early 1990s by members of Tamahaki who trace their ancestry back to the original community. The land is currently subject to dispute, with the local Māori group, Te Whanau o Tieke, claiming that the land was confiscated illegally. The site is currently co-managed between the Department of Conservation and Te Whanau o Tieke. The site is open to the public, and available to be booked year round.

==Ecology==
===Flora===
Whanganui National Park protects a large area of lowland forest and important habitat for native wildlife. 

There are numerous stands of podocarp-hardwood forest made up of species including kāmahi and tawa, with rimu, mīro and tōtaraus on steeper terrain. In lower-lying areas near the river kahikatea, mataī and nīkau palm can be found. Large northern rātā grow throughout the park.

===Fauna===
Many species of birds can be found throughout the park. The park protects the habitat of several thousand threatened North Island brown kiwi and the endangered blue duck (whio). Other birds that frequent the park include the grey warbler, yellow-crowned kākāriki, New Zealand falcon (kārearea), New Zealand pigeon (kererū), Rifleman (tītipounamu), silvereye, tomtit, tūī and whitehead. 

Many species of native fish inhabit the Whanganui River that runs through the park, where native freshwater crayfish (kōura), black flounder, pouched lamprey and eels are also present.

<doc id="1147217" wikidata="Q660729" url="?curid=1147217" title="The Angels (Australian band)">
<text>The Angels are an Australian rock band that formed in 1974 in Adelaide as the Keystone Angels with Bernard &quot;Doc&quot; Neeson on lead vocals and bass guitar, John Brewster on rhythm guitar and backing vocals, his brother Rick Brewster on lead guitar and backing vocals, and Peter &quot;Charlie&quot; King on drums. In 1976, King was replaced by Graham &quot;Buzz&quot; Bidstrup on drums, Chris Bailey took over bass duties so Neeson could focus solely on vocals, and they changed their name to just &#x27;the Angels&#x27;. Their studio albums that peaked in the Australian top 10 are &quot;No Exit&quot; (1979), &quot;Dark Room&quot; (1980), &quot;Night Attack&quot; (1981), &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot; (1984), &quot;Howling&quot; (1986) and &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot; (1990). Their top 20 singles are &quot;No Secrets&quot; (1980), &quot;Into the Heat&quot; (1981), &quot;We Gotta Get out of This Place&quot; (1987), &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot; (live, 1988), &quot;Let the Night Roll On&quot; and &quot;Dogs Are Talking&quot; (both 1990).

To avoid legal problems with similarly named acts in the international market, their records have been released under the names Angel City and later the Angels from Angel City, although the group has said numerous times that they dislike these names. Bands that have cited the Angels as having influenced their music include Guns N&#x27; Roses and Cheap Trick, who became friends and touring buddies, Great White, who have covered two of their songs, and Seattle grunge band Pearl Jam, among many others. Neeson left the group in 1999 due to spinal injuries sustained in a car accident and they disbanded the following year. Competing versions of the group subsequently performed using the Angels name, until April 2008 when the original 1970s line-up reformed for a series of tours until 2011, when Neeson and Bidstrup left again. Alternative versions continued with new members, with the current line-up featuring the founding Brewster brothers, John Brewster&#x27;s sons Sam (bass) and Tom (drums) and lead vocalist Nick Norton.

The Angels were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in October 1998 with the line-up of Bailey, John and Rick Brewster, Eccles and Neeson. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane declared that &quot;The Angels had a profound effect on the Australian live music scene of the late 1970s/early 1980s. [They] helped redefine the Australian pub rock tradition... [their] brand of no-frills, hard-driving boogie rock attracted pub goers in unprecedented numbers. In turn, The Angels&#x27; shows raised the standard expected of live music. After 20 years on the road, the band showed little sign of easing up on the hard rock fever.&quot; Chris Bailey died of throat cancer on 4 April 2013, aged 62. Doc Neeson died of a brain tumour on 4 June 2014, aged 67.

==History==
===Early 1970s===
In November 1970, future member of the Angels, John Brewster on guitar, banjo, harp, backing vocals and washboard, and his younger brother Rick on violin, washboard, jug, backing vocals and percussion formed the Moonshine Jug and String Band, an acoustic ensemble, in Adelaide. Fellow members were Craig Holden on guitar, Bob Petchell on banjo and harp, and Pete Thorpe on tea chest bass, bass guitar, wash tub and backing vocals. In 1971 they were joined by Belfast-born immigrant, Bernard &quot;Doc&quot; Neeson, on guitar and lead vocals (ex-the Innocents), an arts student and former army sergeant, who already performed locally as Doc Talbot. The folk band gigged at local university campuses and cafes. Holden left in 1972.

In 1973, Spencer Tregloan joined Moonshine Jug and String Band on banjo, kazoo, jug, tuba and backing vocals. They released their debut four-track extended play, &quot;Keep You on the Move&quot;, which made the top 5 in Adelaide. It contained a cover version of Canned Heat&#x27;s &quot;On the Road Again&quot; and three original tracks: one written by John, one by John and Rick, and one by Neeson. It was followed in 1974 by a single, &quot;That&#x27;s All Right with Me&quot;. Both releases were on the Sphere Organisation label owned by John Woodruff, who later became the Angels&#x27; talent manager for two decades. In 2015 the group were inducted into the Adelaide Music Collective Hall of Fame.

In mid-1974, Moonshine Jug and String Band changed their name to the Keystone Angels, with the line up of John Brewster on lead vocals and bass guitar, Rick on guitar, Neeson on bass guitar and vocals, Peter Christopolous (a.k.a. Charlie King) on drums and Laurie Lever on keyboards. They had switched to electric instruments and began playing 1950s rock and roll on the pub circuit. Rick later recalled &quot;There was a cult following with The Jug Band but if we wanted any real success we had to start an electric band. So we threw ourselves in the deep end. I went from playing washboard to playing lead guitar. I hadn&#x27;t even played an electric guitar before then!&quot;

During July and August 1974, they ran a series of ads in &quot;Go-Set&quot;, the national teen pop music magazine, announcing that &quot;The Keystone Angels are coming&quot;. Lever left during that year. In January 1975, the remaining members performed, as a four-piece, at the Sunbury Pop Festival, then they supported AC/DC during a South Australian tour, and later that year they were the backing band for Chuck Berry. The Keystone Angels issued a sole single, &quot;Keep on Dancin&#x27;&quot;, on Sphere during that year.

=== Late 1970s: First three albums ===
In 1976, the Angels signed a recording deal with the Albert Productions label, upon the recommendation of Bon Scott and Malcolm Young (from AC/DC). The group dropped &quot;Keystone&quot; from their name to become the Angels and relocated to Sydney with the line-up of Neeson on lead vocals and bass guitar, King on drums, Rick on lead guitar and John Brewster on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. According to Ian McFarlane, an Australian musicologist, the group &quot;had toughened its sound into a unique brand of beefy hard rock.&quot;

The Angels&#x27; first single, &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot;, was released in March 1976, which was produced by Vanda &amp; Young. It was co-written by the Brewsters and Neeson; which is the first of three versions of that they released as singles during their career. They made their TV debut on national pop music show, &quot;Countdown&quot;. Later that year, King was replaced by Graham &quot;Buzz Throckman&quot; Bidstrup on drums and Chris Bailey (ex-Red Angel Panic, Headband) joined on bass guitar, which allowed Neeson to concentrate on lead vocals. Bailey had also been a member of Mount Lofty Rangers, with Bon Scott, in 1974.

The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;You&#x27;re a Lady Now&quot;, was released in July 1977, which was followed a month later by their self-titled debut album, &quot;The Angels&quot; – also produced and recorded by Vanda &amp; Young at Albert Studios, Sydney. It included a re-recorded version of &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot;. Most of its ten tracks were co-written by Neeson and the Brewster brothers. Neeson&#x27;s work as front man allowed the band to develop an energetic and theatrical live presence; he typically appeared on stage as a wild extrovert, dressed in a dinner suit, and sometimes a bow tie, and shaking maracas. As a foil Rick remained motionless and wore sunglasses; he has stated that Beethoven convinced him not to move on stage.

Their second album, &quot;Face to Face&quot;, was released in June 1978, which reached No. 16 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart in November and stayed on the charts for 79 weeks. It was accredited as 4× platinum for shipment of 280,000 units. The album was co-produced by the group and Mark Opitz, their sound engineer. All tracks were co-credited to the Brewsters and Neeson. McFarlane described it as a &quot;watershed&quot; release for both the group and Opitz. At the 1978 &quot;TV Week&quot; King of Pop awards Peter Ledger won Best Australian Album Cover Design Award for his artwork. In October 2010 &quot;Face to Face&quot; was listed in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

By 1978, they &quot;were Australia&#x27;s highest paid band, attracting record crowds wherever they played. As the consummate frontman, the charismatic Doc Neeson injected a strong theatrical edge into the band&#x27;s on-stage antics. The Angels were often seen as a punk/new wave outfit, yet the high energy sound, powerful guitar riffing and muscular yet supple rhythm section took the band beyond such easy categorisations.&quot; Ed Nimmervoll of Howlspace website opined that the album &quot;delivered a tough blend of punk and metal. The band brought it home on stage behind their theatrical lead singer, jumping and gesturing maniacally, highlighting the drama in the lyrics. In every way they were one of the most exciting bands in the country, and exhaustive touring brought the band a generation of loyal fans.&quot;

&quot;Face to Face&quot; provided the band&#x27;s first top 50 appearance on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart with &quot;Take a Long Line&quot;, which peaked at No. 29. David Crofts of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; caught their local gig in October 1978, where they were supported by Midnight Oil:&quot;The Angels have a more limited repertoire than Midnight Oil. What the band does might not be as creative but it is good. Very good... The band&#x27;s raw rhythm is magnetic... one number that is vaguely reminiscent of Lou Reed, &#x27;Coming Down&#x27; was my pick of their best act.&quot;In November they supported David Bowie on his first Australian tour, however Crofts felt that at their Canberra gig they &quot;played disappointingly. They played for only 35 minutes, apparently without feeling what-so-ever... they weren&#x27;t a patch on their performance at the ANU a month ago.&quot; According to Neeson, &quot;Bowie was fantastic. He treated us as his guests. He came down to our very first sound check and he offered us everything on stage in terms of lighting except for one special one that he wanted to keep.&quot; To coincide with the support slot, the Angels issued their first extended play, &quot;After the Rain – The Tour&quot;, with three tracks.

In June 1979, &quot;No Exit&quot;, their third studio album was released, which peaked at No. 8. It was co-produced by the band and Opitz, again. George Young (of Vanda &amp; Young) contributed as a backing vocalist on the track, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;″ Greg Falk reviewed their live performance in June, where they were supported by Flowers, &quot;The Angels play to a set formula in their music. It&#x27;s fast rock with no empty spaces. Rhythm guitarist John Brewster gives backing vocals to Doc Neeson while brother Rick Brewster fills in any gaps that have been left. The band&#x27;s new material sounds very similar to their brilliant [second] album... [They] have worked themselves into a tight unit giving out as much energy as the audience on Tuesday gave back to them.&quot; &quot;No Exit&quot; provided the single, &quot;Shadow Boxer&quot;, which peaked at No. 25.

On 29 September of that year, Alberts released the &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; four-track EP, which provided the third studio version of &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot; in three years. The EP reached No. 29 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1979, the band performed in front of almost 60,000 people on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. Their set, however, was cut short when a riot broke out in the audience. Neeson was cut by a broken bottle thrown by an audience member, and Bailey was knocked unconscious by another bottle: both were taken to hospital to receive stitches.

===1980s: &quot;Face to Face&quot; overseas version to &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot;===
The Angels signed an international contract with CBS Records and, in March 1980, released a new version of &quot;Face to Face&quot; on the Epic Records subsidiary. It is a compilation of tracks from the Australian forms of &quot;Face to Face&quot; and &quot;No Exit&quot;, plus an edited variety of the 1979 studio version of &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot; from &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. The Australian band billed itself as Angel City to avoid legal problems with the Casablanca Records&#x27; glam rockers, Angel. They stated that they hated the international name, Angel City. Nevertheless, they spent over half of that year touring the United States and Canada in support of the album. AllMusic&#x27;s John Floyd described them, &quot;This roaring Australian combo displays their AC/DC-cum-punk hearts on a powerful US debut.&quot;

The group undertook an international tour with six weeks in the US and a month in Europe. Karen Hughes of the &quot;Canberra Times&quot; described the group&#x27;s performance in New York, where the &quot;relentless, hard edged, machine gun-like attack won from an extremely difficult audience dotted with rock luminaries Mick Ronson, Ian Hunter and Karla Devito, if nothing else, respect.&quot; Their Los Angeles show was &quot;a subtler version of the &#x27;Angel City&#x27; phenomenon, so familiar to Australian rock audiences. That night the five-piece band elevated the capacity crowd, members of new wave bands UFO and Pretenders included, to a truly feverish climax that begged three encores.&quot;

In June 1980, &quot;Dark Room&quot;, their fourth studio album was released, which was produced by the Brewster brothers. The album peaked at No. 5 in Australia and No. 37 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. Its overseas version had re-recorded versions of &quot;Ivory Stairs&quot; and &quot;Straight Jacket&quot; in place of &quot;Alexander&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Scared&quot;. The American band, Great White, later covered &quot;Face the Day&quot; (from this LP), as well as &quot;Can&#x27;t Shake It&quot; from &quot;No Exit&quot;. &quot;Dark Room&quot; provided the single, &quot;No Secrets&quot;, in May, which peaked at No. 8 on the Australian charts. It was co-written by Bidstrup and Neeson.

Two further singles, &quot;Poor Baby&quot; and &quot;Face the Day&quot; followed, both reached the top 100. Their performance of &quot;No Secrets&quot; on &quot;Countdown&quot; in August was described by &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;″s Greg Flynn, &quot;A towering and courteous gentleman named Doc Neeson, nattily dressed in white dinner jacket and sneakers, was given the nod by a floor manager and loped onto a black-and-white chequered set. Music erupted from amplifiers dotted around the studio and Doc launched himself into a song about an actress who &#x27;lives in a tower armed with defences she learnt from her mother and friends&#x27;. Doc, for those of you still faithfully dusting your Glenn Miller records, is lead singer for The Angels – Australia&#x27;s top drawing live band.&quot;

During October 1980, they supported the Kinks on a US tour, which was a &quot;dynamic double bill of rock music&quot; according to Susan Moore of &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. John Brewster had described their earlier Australian tour to Moore, &quot;We&#x27;ve really enjoyed the last year. The national tour for our album &quot;Dark Room&quot; was a very interesting tour, with lots of high spots.&quot;

In March 1981, Bidstrup left the band, reportedly due to non-musical differences, and was replaced by New Zealander, Brent Eccles (ex-Space Waltz, Citizen Band), on drums and percussion. Bidstrup was a touring member of the Swingers in that year, he joined the Party Boys in 1983 and formed GANGgajang in the following year. In May 1981 they issued a non-album single, &quot;Into the Heat&quot;, which peaked at No. 14. It was followed on 24 October by a four-track live EP, &quot;Never So Live&quot;, recorded by the new line-up, which reached No. 17. On the strength of a new track, &quot;Fashion and Fame&quot;, it shipped 80,000 copies.

In November 1981, the group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Night Attack&quot;, which was produced by Ed Thacker and the Brewsters, was released. McFarlane felt it &quot;saw the songs moving into heavy metal territory&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 in Australia and No. 14 in New Zealand. As their third international album, &quot;Night Attack&quot;, included a remixed version of &quot;Back on You&quot;, previously available on the flip-side of the &quot;Into the Heat&quot; single. Early in 1982 Bailey left the group due to &quot;visa issues that prevented his joining the band in the US.&quot; Los Angeles-based session musician, Jim Hilbun (Holly Penfield, see Ian Ritchie), was recruited as his replacement on bass guitar, vocals, saxophone and organ. Bailey joined Adelaide-based rock group, Gotham City, in late 1982 alongside Bidstrup; two years later the pair were founders of GANGgajang in Sydney.

In January 1983, the Angels headlined the inaugural Narara Music Festival. Neeson arranged for the performance to be filmed, as he intended it to be his last with the band, he had initially planned to leave the group and pursue an acting career. &quot;Live at Narara&quot;, with 11 tracks, was released on VHS in 1988 via Mushroom Video. The film crew were Greg Hunter, Andy Capp and Garry Maunder on cameras; Matt Butler as editor; directed by Bernie Cannon; Neeson as executive producer and produced in association with radio station, Triple M. McFarlane felt it &quot;featured the band delivering an absolutely blistering performance.&quot; After the festival Neeson continued with the group.

In May 1983, they released their sixth studio album, &quot;Watch the Red&quot;, which was produced by the Angels, and engineered by Andrew Scott and Al Wright. It peaked at No. 6 on the Australian chart and reached the top 50 in New Zealand. It fulfilled their obligations to CBS and Epic Records and they signed with Mushroom Records with overseas distribution by Music Corporation of America (MCA). Shane Pinnegar of &quot;100% Rock Magazine&quot; revisited the album in May 2014 and felt it &quot;wasn&#x27;t so much a left turn for The Angels as a widening of their sound palette... [Hilbun was] to surprise the band as much as the fans when he proved to be a very capable sax player... a fascinating album, a collision of intellectual observational lyricism, a manic confrontational mix of personalities in the band, and a need to evolve slightly beyond the straight pub rock they had made a name for themselves playing for the previous ten years.&quot;

The lead single, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, written by Hilbun, reached No. 21 in Australia. The album, critically acclaimed for its musical inventiveness, featured saxophone leads from Hilbun, John Brewster on lead vocals for a track (&quot;No Sleep in Hell&quot;), and even a piano accordion. Material was derived from a 40-minute jam-session, later released in Australia as &quot;The Blow&quot;, including an instrumental track and some improvised lyrics from Neeson. Recording sessions were interrupted by a fire, which gutted the studio, almost destroying the master tapes. Its second single, &quot;Eat City&quot;, peaked at No. 22. During 1983 they toured the US again, they were the support act for the Kinks. In April 2010 Neeson appeared on ABC-TV&#x27;s pop music quiz, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, series 6, episode 12, where he claimed that Ray Davies (lead singer of the Kinks) was &quot;scared about the applause we got as a support act.&quot; During the tour Davies directed that the Angels&#x27; stage lights be halved and finally he took them off the tour prior to the last show at Madison Square Gardens.

The Angels&#x27; seventh studio album, &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot;, was released in January 1985, following a three-month recording stint in Los Angeles with Ashley Howe producing. It peaked at No. 5 in Australia and the top 40 in New Zealand. The album&#x27;s fourth Australian single, &quot;Underground&quot;, was released in mid-1985 and reached the top 60 in Australia, In the US it had been released earlier and peaked at No. 35, in February, on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Mainstream Rock Songs. The US album, on MCA, included a re-recording of their 1978 song, &quot;Be with You&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s last commercially available single in that market. Metal Blade Records re-issued the album in 1990.

Unfortunately for the band, a personnel purge at MCA meant that &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot; received little support from the label. MCA rejected the group&#x27;s next album. As Angel City, they performed four songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert, part of the global Live Aid program: &quot;Small Price&quot;, &quot;Eat City&quot;, &quot;Underground&quot;, and &quot;Take a Long Line&quot;. They were broadcast in Australia, (on both the Seven Network and Nine Network), and on MTV in the US.

John Brewster left the band in February 1986, his last concerts were on 27 January – a double in Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl and then the Palace Theatre. In his place they hired ex-Skyhooks guitarist Bob Spencer in March. John Brewster joined a new version of the Party Boys in that year and remained until 1989. In October 1986, &quot;Howling&quot;, their eighth studio album, which was recorded at Sydney&#x27;s Rhinoceros Studios with Steve Brown producing (US, Cult, Wham), was released on Mushroom Records. It reached No. 6 in Australia and No. 10 in New Zealand.

Eccles explained to Pollyanna Sutton of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; how the group&#x27;s sound had developed: &quot;The change started when John Brewster left. He virtually ran the band and there were a lot of things we would have liked to have done with &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot;. &quot;Howling&quot; is the follow-up. We experimented with stuff then and different instruments and with this album we sealed it with new instruments and backing singers right up there. It really represents what the band is capable of.&quot; It provided a cover version of the Animals&#x27; hit, &quot;We Gotta Get out of This Place&quot; in January 1987 which, at No. 7, became the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in Australia. It peaked at No. 13 in New Zealand.

In December 1987, a double live album, &quot;Live Line&quot;, was released, which peaked at No. 3 in Australia and No. 13 in New Zealand. The collection spanned ten years of their career. Most of its tracks were recorded at the Bankstown RSL Club, Sydney, with some taken from earlier tours with John Brewster. The CD version included four songs not included on the vinyl release. A live version of &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot; was issued in January 1988 as a single, which reached No. 11 in Australia and included the first recording of the audience response chant, &quot;No Way, Get Fucked, Fuck Off&quot;. Another single was a medley of &quot;Love Takes Care&quot; and &quot;Be with You&quot; in May.

In May 1988, Spencer broke his wrist as the result of an &quot;unfortunate collision&quot; on stage with Neeson. He was substituted, on a national tour, by Jimi &quot;The Human&quot; Hocking on guitar and backing vocals. Hocking later recalled &quot;I was called up as the result of some session work I had recently done. It was originally to fill in for one night and the tour would be cancelled. The gig went so well, that the band offered me the guitar spot for the rest of the tour, so overnight I found myself on a major rock tour at 24 years of age.&quot; For each gig they provided a lengthy three-hour set which covered their musical history. After the tour Spencer resumed his duties on guitar and Hocking formed a new band, Jimi the Human and Spectre 7.

Chrysalis Records in the US and Japan issued the group&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot;, using the band name, the Angels from Angel City, in November 1989. It was recorded in Memphis with Terry Manning (ZZ Top, Led Zeppelin) producing. While working on the album the group and Manning &quot;on guitar, played fun gigs billed as Dancing Dick and the Richards and The Cow Demons.&quot; During recording sessions Hilbun was replaced by James Morley (ex-Strawberry Blonde) on bass guitar and backing vocals. Hilbun became a member of Richard Clapton&#x27;s backing band in 1989 and then Angry Anderson&#x27;s band in the following year.

The international version had new re-recordings of previously released tracks, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t the One&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Shake It&quot;, &quot;Who Rings the Bell&quot;, &quot;City out of Control&quot; and &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot;, none of which were available in Australia. Alan Niven was signed on as their US manager; he also handled Great White and Guns N&#x27; Roses. However, Niven soon left the Angels management.

===1990s: &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot; to Doc Neeson&#x27;s departure===

The international version of &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot; had only included four new tracks, three of these appeared on the Australian form of the album, which was released in February 1990 via Mushroom Records. It also had eight new tracks, all produced by Manning, not available on the international format. In June of that year &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot; became the Angels&#x27; first and only No. 1 album in Australia, where it remained in the top 100 for 38 weeks and was certified platinum for shipment of 70,000 units. In New Zealand, in September, it reached No. 3 – their highest-charting album there.

McFarlane opined that &quot;It was one of The Angels&#x27; best albums, Manning having stripped the band&#x27;s sound back to basics and brought the guitars to the fore.&quot; &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; summarised an article from US-based, &quot;Musician&quot;, as &quot;a glowing review... [which] recounted the long history of bum deals and legal problems which have kept The Angels off the American market&quot; with the album showing a &quot;wonderfully off-hand confidence.&quot; Nimmervoll observed that &quot;Internationally it was the last throw of the dice. For whatever reason, despite their reputation, the Angels had never established a sustainable international following.&quot;

In Australia it provided five singles, starting with &quot;Let the Night Roll On&quot; which peaked at No. 17 in Australia. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; reviewer described it as &quot;hard rock, basic as a scream and powerful as a punch. A taste of things to come... Get your head ready for a bit of banging.&quot; &quot;Dogs are Talking&quot;, reached No. 11 in Australia and was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 copies. It was co-written by Rick, Eccles, Hilbun, Neeson and Spencer and charted in New Zealand at No. 12.

Their Beyond Salvation Tour had Cheap Trick as a support act. The flip-side of the Australian version of &quot;Dogs are Talking&quot; featured demo tracks by three new Australian acts, which supported the Angels on that tour: the Desert Cats, the Hurricanes and the John Woodruff-managed group, Baby Animals. In New Zealand the B-side of &quot;Dogs Are Talking&quot; featured songs from two local support acts; both were the first releases: Nine Livez&#x27; &quot;Live It Up&quot; and Shihad&#x27;s &quot;Down Dance&quot;.

&quot;Back Street Pickup&quot; peaked in the top 30 in both Australia and New Zealand. Its music video was filmed the day the band were told of the album reaching number one on the charts and shows a buoyant and enthusiastic band performing.

&quot;Red Back Fever&quot;, their tenth studio album, had partly been recorded in Memphis with Terry Manning producing the basic tracks during the &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot; sessions, and was released in November 1991. It was co-produced by the group with Steve James, which reached No. 14 in Australia and the top 50 in New Zealand. The band toured for two years, and the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Tear Me Apart&quot; (July 1992), was included in a multimillion-dollar government campaign highlighting alcohol-related violence. It reached the top 40. Also in that month Mushroom re-issued the album as a two-CD set: &quot;Red Back Fever&quot; / &quot;Left Hand Drive&quot;; the latter contained unreleased and rare tracks. Then they undertook the Alcohol and Violence Tears You Apart tour.

In 1992, Spencer left and Morley followed soon after, they were subsequently replaced by returning members John Brewster and Hilbun. Spencer joined Black Cat Moan and then was a member of the Choirboys from 1992 to 2004. Morley joined a string of cover bands. In 1993 the Angels performed a one-off gig at the University of Western Sydney, co-headlining with the Screaming Jets. Other artists on the bill were Mental as Anything, Peter Wells (formerly of Rose Tattoo) and Wickud Skunk, a band from Tasmania.

In 1994, the New Zealand chapter of Hells Angels asked the band to perform. They issued a compilation album, &quot;Evidence&quot; in December of that year, which included two new tracks: &quot;Don&#x27;t Need Mercy&quot; and &quot;Turn It On&quot;. &quot;The Hard Evidence Tour E.P.&quot; followed in April of the next year which included those two tracks from &quot;Evidence&quot; and two more new ones, &quot;Spinning My Wheels&quot; and &quot;Blue Light&quot;.

In April 1995, they head-lined the Barbed Wire Ball tour, a national tour that also featured the Screaming Jets, The Poor and Who&#x27;s Guilty. The band took a hiatus from recording and touring, to reconvene in mid-1996 at Darling Harbour studios for the start of sessions for their eleventh studio album, &quot;Skin &amp; Bone&quot; (1998).

In July 1997, the Angels hit the road with the Lounge Lizard Tour, with guest vocalists Angry Anderson (from Rose Tattoo) and Ross Wilson (from Daddy Cool, Mondo Rock). The band provided acoustic backing for each singer&#x27;s performance, which included works from their respective bands. On 13 August of that year the Angels signed a recording deal with Shock Records in Australia.

A new single, &quot;Caught in the Night&quot;, written by Jim Hilbun with Doc changing the chorus lyrics and Rick contributing a chord change, was released in October 1997. It was followed by &quot;Skin &amp; Bone&quot;, which peaked at No. 29 on the ARIA Albums Chart. On 20 October 1998 the Angels, line-up of Chris Bailey, Jim Hilbun. John and Rick Brewster, Brent Eccles and Doc Neeson, were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Angry Anderson. In November 1998 the band performed a brief set at the Concert of the Century in Melbourne to celebrate Mushroom Records&#x27; 25th anniversary. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999 they performed their last concert at the MGM Grand Darwin Millennium Concert. Shortly afterwards, Doc Neeson announced his hiatus from the band following a major car accident that had left him with neck and spinal injuries.

===2000s: Spinoff bands to reunion===
With Neeson&#x27;s departure, the Angels effectively ceased, although Rick and John Brewster considered recruiting another singer. In November 2000 Shock Records reissued &quot;Left Hand Drive&quot;. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation featured the group in its music series, &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot;, in &quot;Episode 4: Berserk Warriors&quot;, broadcast on 5 September 2001. It, and two subsequent episodes, was issued as a video recording, &quot;Long Way to the Top: Stories of Australian and New Zealand Rock and Roll: Episodes 4-6: Disc 2&quot;, in that year. In the episode Neeson described pub venues, &quot;The stench would just hit you and the atmosphere was overwhelming, like a real energy built out of the claustrophobia... We looked forward to playing at the Lifesaver &#x27;cause it was the sort of thing where you could go in and try anything. Once, during the solo, I started throwing fish at the audience.&quot;

During the 2000s, competing versions of the group under different names were formed either by the Brewster brothers or by Neeson. In March 2001 a new version, Members of the Angels, with the line-up of Bailey, Bidstrup, John and Rick Brewster and Hilbun on lead vocals. They provided a one-off performance at one of the Ted Mulry Benefit Concerts, which were released on video as &quot;Gimme Ted&quot; (2003). On 24 June 2002 Shock Records issued &quot;The Complete Sessions 1980–1983&quot;, a 4-CD box set of the band&#x27;s recorded output from &quot;Dark Room&quot; to the &quot;Watch the Red&quot; albums. Around that time, Bailey, Bidstrup and the Brewsters toured as the Original Angels Band. Neeson later recalled, &quot;When I had my car accident I was told I was going to end up in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. We made an agreement about the use of the name The Angels because they wanted to continue.&quot;

In the meantime, Neeson, Hilbun and Westfield chief executive David Lowy formed Red Phoenix, releasing an album produced by Terry Manning and touring briefly during 2005. In July 2006 Liberation reissued much of the Angels&#x27; catalogue including &quot;Dark Room&quot;, &quot;Night Attack&quot;, &quot;Watch the Red&quot;, &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot;, &quot;Howling&quot;, &quot;Beyond Salvation&quot;, &quot;Red Back Fever&quot; and &quot;Wasted Sleepless Night – The Definitive Greatest Hits&quot;.

On 4 December 2006 &quot;Live at the Basement&quot; was released, which was recorded by the Bailey, Bidstrup and Brewsters: once again using the name, the Angels. In September 2007 Neeson won a legal injunction to stop them from using that name. As a part of the &quot;Countdown&quot; Spectacular 2, he toured Australian capitals as Doc Neeson&#x27;s Angels from 18 August to 5 September 2007. He used the line-up of Hilbun, Lowy, Dave Leslie (ex-Baby Animals) on guitar and Paul Wheeler (ex-Icehouse), who was later replaced by Mick Skelton, on drums. The Neeson version released an album, &quot;Acoustic Sessions&quot; (1 September 2007), using Hilbun, Leslie and Tim Powles on percussion, via Liberation Blue. The Brewster-led band meanwhile released an EP, &quot;Ivory Stairs&quot;.

In October 2007, Neeson&#x27;s band joined the Tour de Force, which performed in the Middle East for 13 shows in 16 days for Australian service personnel in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait. His line-up for the tour was Leslie, Skelton, Sarah Graye (ex-Nitocris) on bass guitar and Mitch Hutchinson on guitar. While in the field Neeson was presented with two medals, National Service Medal and the Australian Defence Medal, by Major General Mark Evans in Baghdad. &quot;Wasted Sleepless Nights: The Definitive Greatest Hits&quot; was released as a DVD on 11 July 2007. It included live footage never before released, and tracks recorded live from ABC&#x27;s Studio 22.

Paul Cashmere of Undercover.com.au announced the reunion of Neeson with Bailey, Bidstrup and the Brewster brothers, as the Angels in April 2008. The re-formed band played a string of dates from June to August 2008, which included celebration of the 30th anniversary of their album, &quot;Face to Face&quot;. The &quot;uneasy reconciliation&quot; between the members was shown in a documentary, &quot;No Way, Get F*#ked, F*#k Off!&quot; (11 October 2008) screened on SBS-TV. It was directed by Ben Ulm, produced by Stu McCarney, edited by Francine Thomson, audio mixed by Mark Tanner and original score by Rick Brewster. It was released on DVD, under the same name, via Beyond Home Entertainment, later that year.

===2010s: Neeson solo to Gleeson on lead vocals===

In late 2010, Neeson announced that he would resume his solo career. He went on to form the Angels 100% with Bidstrup, Hilbun, Morley, and Spencer. They performed a sole private show to 1,000 people at a mining installation in Western Australia in late 2012.

In May 2011, Bailey and the Brewsters recruited drummer Nick Norton, and Screaming Jets singer (and MMM FM radio DJ), Dave Gleeson to front the Angels. Bidstrup and Neeson claim &quot;the remaining three members of the band have contravened an agreement by bringing in two new members to tour Australian pubs as The Angels.&quot; Nevertheless, this line-up recorded new tracks for the first time since the late 1990s. In June 2011 they released an EP, &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;, and toured Australia in support through to 2012. In January 2012 they recorded a live album, the Angels first in two decades, at the QPAC theatre in Brisbane.

On 31 August 2012, the Angels, with Gleeson aboard, released their first new studio album in 14 years, &quot;Take It to the Streets&quot;, which peaked at No. 24 on the ARIA albums chart. On the same day they also released &quot;Live at QPAC&quot;, the band&#x27;s first live album since 1988&#x27;s &quot;Liveline&quot;. It was briefly available as a 2× CD album.

In November and December 2012, the Angels with Dave Gleeson joined the Baby Animals and the Hoodoo Gurus for the national A Day on the Green tour, resulting in a headlining show in front of 8,500 in Perth. Also in November the Angels with Gleeson began recording songs for a new studio album, and announced their Take It to the Streets national tour, from 22 February to 20 April 2013. However, in January 2013, Bailey was diagnosed with throat cancer, and John Brewster&#x27;s son, Sam Brewster, would step in for him playing bass on tour. Sam would become the official bass player for the band after Bailey&#x27;s death from the cancer on 4 April 2013 at age 62. In February 2014 they released a second album with Gleeson, &quot;Talk the Talk&quot;, which reached the top 50.

From November 2019, The Angels co-headlined the &quot;They Who Rock 2019&quot; tour with Baby Animals. The promote the tour, The Angels released a cover of The Baby Animals&#x27; &quot;One Word&quot; and the Baby Animals covered The Angels&#x27; &quot;Marseilles&quot;, both released on 1 October 2019.

===2020s: New material and Gleeson&#x27;s departure===
In June 2020, the Angels released the EP &quot;Under the Stone&quot;, the first new material in 6 years. In 2020, The Angels were listed at number 45 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time&quot; issue.

In December 2021, the band performed with the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra in a special concert named &quot;Symphony of Angels&quot;. The following year, the Brewster brothers joined Dune Rats in the ABC studios to record a cover of &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot; for triple j&#x27;s &quot;Like a Version&quot; segment.

In May 2023, Gleeson announced that he would be stepping down as the band&#x27;s lead vocalist, with drummer Nick Norton taking his place. The line-up change also introduced new member Tom Brewster on drums, who is John Brewster&#x27;s son and Sam Brewster&#x27;s brother.

In May 2024, the group announced the forthcoming released of &quot;Ninety Nine&quot;, their first studio album in ten years.

==Illnesses and deaths==

In January 2013, it was announced that Chris Bailey had been diagnosed with a throat cancer, and his place on bass guitar with the Angels was filled by John Brewster&#x27;s son, Sam. Bailey died on 4 April 2013, aged 62. A tribute concert for him was held at Thebarton Theatre on 17 April. Gary Bradshaw of &quot;Amnplify&quot; described how &quot;the planned benefit gig turned into a night to celebrate Chris&#x27; life and his contribution to Australian music over many years.&quot; The Angels and other fellow Australians performed.

On 10 January 2013, Neeson revealed that he had been diagnosed with a brain tumour and would undergo immediate treatment. At a benefit concert, Rock for Doc, in April Neeson told the audience, &quot;The news is grim. But some people can actually get right through and that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;m trying to think about things. So I&#x27;m looking forward optimistically to the future... And I&#x27;ve been sick with a brain tumour, and my doctors told me not to come out tonight. But the show goes on!&quot; He performed two songs; other artists at the Enmore Theatre were members of Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo, Noiseworks, Cold Chisel, Dragon and Mi-Sex. On 4 June 2014, Bernard &quot;Doc&quot; Neeson died of his brain tumour, aged 67.

<text>Tirupati Venkata Kavulu ( Poets Tirupati &amp; Venkata) refers to the Telugu poet duo Divakarla Tirupati Sastry (1872–1919) and Chellapilla Venkata Sastry (1870–1950). These twin poets are acclaimed as the harbingers of modern poetry in Telugu. They have dramatised several of the Hindu epics into dramas and plays consisting of singable verses set to perfect meter. Several of their plays, especially &quot;pandavodyogavijayalu&quot; have been extremely popular with many drama clubs and audiences across Andhra Pradesh. Venkata Sastry has trained a large number of later age poets including Viswanatha Satyanarayana, Pingali Lakshmikantam and Veturi.

==Awards==
* Chellapilla Venkata Sastry was conferred Kala Prapoorna by Andhra University in 1938.

<text>&quot;Mawlay&quot; Sulayman bin Mohammed (), born on 28 June 1766 in Tafilalt and died on 28 November 1822 in Marrakesh, was a Sultan of Morocco from 1792 to 1822, as a ruler of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty. He was proclaimed sultan after the death of his half-brother al-Yazid. Sulayman continued his father&#x27;s centralization and expansion of the kingdom, and most notably ended the piracy that had long operated from Morocco&#x27;s coast. As part of Morocco&#x27;s long running conflict with Spain and Portugal, Sulayman halted all trade with Europe. However, he continued his father&#x27;s policies of close relations with the United States. He was also a follower of Wahhabism.

== Early life ==
Mawlay Sulayman was born in Tafilalt on 28 June 1766 to Sidi Mohammed III and one of his wives a lady of the Ahlaf tribe. His father Sidi Mohammed took significant care in his religious education, thus Sulayman memorised the Qur&#x27;an in a Zawiya in Safi and studied the biography of Muhammad in Ksar al-Kabir. Sulayman went to Tafilalt in 1783 with two of his brothers where they were given private tutors, there he had the most exceptional &#x27;Ulama of Fes, such as Abd al-Qadir bin Shaqrun and Hamdun bin al-Hajj. He went to Fes in 1790, and in March 1792, he was offered the throne by the people of Fes. Sulayman accepted, however he accepted only upon the condition that he would not take part in fighting his brothers in the ongoing civil war, despite him being little prepared to govern a kingdom. He had great respect for the Shari&#x27;a.

== Reign ==

=== Early reign ===
Once Mawlay al-Yazid died in Marrakesh on 17 February 1792, the struggle for power began between the sons of Mohammed III. There was Mawlay Hisham who ruled in Marrakesh, and Mawlay Maslama who ruled in the north. Mawlay Sulayman emerged successful in 1795, however there was still plenty of resistance which he had to pacify, mainly the Berber tribes of the mountains, and the tariqas. Immediately after this, in 1798, the sultan sent a military expedition to Oujda, which had been controlled by the Ottomans since 1792 during the unrest in Morocco. The sultan encountered no difficulty in recovering Oujda and the eastern provinces from the Turks and set the new border at Wadi Kiss. In 1800, the inhabitants of Tuat agreed to pay taxes to the sultan, extending the authority of the Makhzen southwards and allowing the sultan to increase his revenue. Mawlay Sulayman&#x27;s reign was difficult and chaotic because of the hostilities between tribes that he was unable to appease, with a strong divide between the Arabs and Berbers, as demonstrated by the two major revolts that marked his reign. In Marrakesh, he rebuilt the Ali bin Yusef Mosque, without leaving the slightest trace of its original Almoravid or Almohad design which dated from the early 12th century, completing its construction by 1819 or 1820.

=== Commercial policy ===

Once news of the French invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798 reached Morocco with reports of French soldiers looting, killing, and abusing the Egyptian people, Mawlay Sulayman responded by reversing the overseas trade policy of his father, Muhammad III. Commercial ties with Europe were reduced and foreign businessmen were encouraged to leave Morocco. After this, the sultan turned to the Moroccan heartland, extracting from tribes the traditional Qur&#x27;anic taxes, Zakat and &#x27;Ushr. This policy worked for some time, but after 1817, a series of natural disasters destroyed crops, leading to rebellions. Mawlay Sulayman presented the United States with a two-storey mud and stone building in Tangier in 1821, the country&#x27;s first acquired property. It would house the American Legation and Consulate for 140 years. During the Tripolitan War between the United States and Tripolitania, Morocco declared war on the United States in June 1802, however peace was restored in September 1803 when Edward Preble met Mawlay Sulayman in Tangier and signed a peace treaty.

=== Decline of authority ===

In the spring of 1819, during an epidemic of plague, the sultan decided to lead a major expedition against the Ait Umalu tribe as advised by Muhammad bin al-Ghazi, leader of the Zemur tribe. The army was assembled in Tadla and was made up of Haouz tribes, a northern army, Arab tribes of Azghar, the Udaya, and the &#x27;Abid al-Bukhari. The number of Makhzen troops assembled in Tadla amounted to 60,000 men, and in May 1819, Mawlay Sulayman headed to the Adekhsan where the Ait Umalu were raided, and the two sides engaged in a battle soon after. The battle was intense, however on the second day of the battle, Muhammad bin al-Ghazi abandoned the sultan and joined the Ait Umalu. The Makhzen troops were overwhelmed between the mountain and lowland rebels, and all tribal contingents deserted the sultan, who was left with the Udaya and &#x27;Abid al-Bukhari. By the end of the battle, the Makhzen armies were routed. Mawlay Ibrahim was wounded, and Mawlay Sulayman himself was imprisoned. However, the sultan was shown every respect as he was a Sharif (direct descendant of Muhammad), and was released three days later.

This was followed by a rebellion in Fes in 1820, and Ibrahim bin Yazid proclaimed himself sultan there. From March 1821 to April 1822, Mawlay Sulayman turned his attention to suppressing the rebellions in Fes and Tetuan, sending an army of 15,000 men to Tetuan. The sieges lasted for about a year, and in the spring of 1821, the rebels suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Makhzen troops, and in July, the troops of the sultan inflicted heavy losses on the Ait Umalu. Subsequently, Mawlay Sulayman headed north to inspect the forces besieging Tetuan and spent most of the winter directing military operations from Tangier. Despite receiving a reinforcement of 3,000 men from Dukkala who were mobilised by his nephew Mawlay Abd al-Rahman, the sultan failed to break the resistance of Tetuan, but succeeded in capturing the fortress of Martil in January 1822. Mawlay Sulayman decided to break the siege and return to besieging Fes. Throughout the next month, Mawlay Sulayman pacified the regions north and east of Fes, and following the long siege of Fes, the people of the city opened the gates to the sultan who entered the city on 20 April 1822, and the people of Tetuan did the same soon after on 3 May 1822.

After this, he was himself defeated near Marrakesh in 1822 and had little power left. Mawlay Sulayman entrusted the Ulama of Fes to proclaim his nephew Abd al-Rahman as the new Sultan once he died. Mawlay Sulayman died on 28 November 1822 and was succeeded by Abd al-Rahman bin Hisham.

== Wahhabism ==
During the reign of Mawlay Sulayman, the Wahhabi movement founded by Muhammad bin Abd al-Wahhab in the Arabian Peninsula reached Morocco. Saudi Imam of the Emirate of Diriyah, Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, decided to send messages to all the rulers of the Arab Islamic countries, to Iraq, Egypt, the Levant and the Maghreb, explaining the goals of his call, and his letter reached Mawlay Sulayman in 1811. Mawlay Sulayman was inspired by this Islamic revivalist movement and used his authority to condemn the use of music and dance in religious ceremonies, and banning pilgrimages to saintly shrines and religious festivals, even having the qubba over his father&#x27;s grave removed in 1812, arguing that it was excessive ornamentation.

Mawlay Sulayman clearly opposed worshipping the so-called Muslim saints (&quot;ʾawliyāʾ&quot; ), and in 1805, he ordered the removal of a mausoleum in Rabat, where his father was buried, leaving only the grave. In 1806, he wrote a treatise criticising Sufi practices, which could not be greeted enthusiastically in Morocco where Islam was steeped in Maraboutism. During the reigns of Mawlay Sulayman’s successors, such influences were absent, and the worship of “saints” was openly opposed only by Mawlay Hassan I bin Mohammed (1873–1894).

== Theology ==

&quot;An-Nâsiri said: The Sultan Al moulay Souleymân (ie Moulay Slimane), may Allah bless him, shared this point of view, which is why he wrote his book talking about the Sufis in which he warned against those who refute the Sunnah and support the innovation, as he explained the manner of visiting the Awliya (virtuous) and warned against the exaggeration of the lower people on it, and gave advice to the Muslims.

He also says that Al-Mawlâ Souleymân had written a sermon urging the oneness of Allah and condemning the innovations, and that he ordered it to be distributed in all the Friday mosques, and ordered the closing of the prayer corners Sufis.&quot;

Professor Mohammad Kamal Joumouah notes from the Islamic Encyclopedia that Al-Mawlâ Souleymân had been very concerned after the year 1810 with Wahhabism or the Salafi call held by Sheikh Mohammad ibn Abdil-Wahhâb, which made tough positions against the Sufis.

<text>The Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe, () formerly known as the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe of Louisiana, is a federally recognized tribe of primarily Tunica and Biloxi people, located in east central Louisiana. Descendants of Ofo (Siouan-speakers), Avoyel, and Choctaw are also enrolled in the tribe.

In the 21st century, the people speak mostly English and French. Many live on the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Reservation () in central Avoyelles Parish, just south of the city of Marksville, Louisiana, and overlapping its boundaries. The Reservation is .

The 2010 census lists 951 persons self-identified as at least partly of Tunica-Biloxi, with 669 of those identifying as solely of Tunica-Biloxi ancestry.

==History==

By the Middle Mississippian period, local Late Woodland peoples in the Central Mississippi Valley had developed or adopted a Mississippian lifestyle, with maize agriculture, hierarchical political structures, mussel shell-tempered pottery, and participation in the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC). The archaeological evidence suggests that the valley was home to several competing paramount chiefdoms, with supporting vassal states. The groups in the area have been defined by archaeologists by archaeological phases; these include the Menard, Tipton, Belle Meade-Walls, Parkin and Nodena phases.

In the spring of 1541 Hernando de Soto and his army approached the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, coming upon the Province of Quizquiz (pronounced &quot;keys-key&quot;). These people spoke a dialect of the Tunica language, which is a language isolate. At that time, these related groups covered a large region extending along both sides of the Mississippi River in present-day Mississippi and Arkansas, as the expedition would soon learn.


Based on evaluations of the three surviving de Soto narratives for topography, linguistics and cultural traits, combined with archaeological excavations and analysis, most archaeologists and ethnohistorians have agreed to identify the Menard, Walls, Belle Meade, Parkin and Nodena phases as the de Soto-named provinces of &quot;Anilco, Quizquiz, Aquixo, Casqui&quot; and &quot;Pacaha&quot;, respectively.

It was 150 years before another European group recorded the Tunica. In 1699 the LaSource expedition (coming downriver from French Canada) encountered the Tunica, describing them as a modestly sized tribe numbering only a few hundred warriors. They and other peoples had suffered from smallpox epidemics, which had high mortality rates as they had no natural immunity to this new disease carried by Europeans.

By the time the French arrived, the Central Mississippi Valley was sparsely occupied by the Quapaw. They became significant allies to the French and aided their successful settlement. The French established a mission among the Tunica around 1700, on the Yazoo River. Father Antoine Davion was assigned to the Tunica, as well as to the smaller tribes of the Koroa, Yazoo, and Houspé tribes.

The Tunica were skilled traders and entrepreneurs, especially in the manufacture and distribution of salt, a valuable item to both native and Europeans. Salt was extremely important in the trade between the French and the various Caddoan groups in what are now northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas. The Tunica were believed to be the middlemen in the trade of salt from the Caddoan areas to the French.

By the early 18th century, the tribes along the lower Mississippi River were a target of Chickasaw raids for the English slave trade in South Carolina. By 1706 the Tunica decided to move.

As their enemies the Natchez were to their immediate south, they moved to the Mississippi side of the Mississippi and Red River confluence. This allowed them to keep control of their salt trade, as the Red River also connected to their salt source in the Caddoan areas.

They established a loose collection of hamlets and villages at present-day Angola, Louisiana. The archeological remains of a small hamlet from this time period were discovered in 1976 by an inmate of Angola Prison. It is known as the Bloodhound Site.

During the 1710s and 1720s, war periodically broke out between the French and the Natchez. The last uprising in 1729, the Natchez Massacre, was the largest; the Natchez killed most of the French at the village of Natchez and Fort Rosalie. French colonists gained the aid of Indian allies and returned to the villages, killing or capturing most of the Natchez. The survivors were sold into slavery.

In 1729 the chiefs of the village sent emissaries to potential allies, including the Yazoo, Koroa, Illinois, Chickasaw, and Choctaw. The Natchez Rebellion or Natchez War expanded into a larger regional conflict with many repercussions. The Tunica were initially reluctant to fight on either side.

In June 1730 the Head Chief of the Tunica, &quot;Cahura-Joligo&quot;, agreed to let a small party of Natchez refugees settle near his village (present-day Angola), provided they were unarmed. A few days later, the chief of the Natchez arrived at the Tunica village with a hundred men, and an unknown number of women and children. They concealed Chickasaw and Koroa warriors in the canebrake around the village. &quot;Cahura-Joligo&quot; informed the Natchez party that he could not receive them unless they gave up their arms. They said they intended to do so, but asked to keep their arms a while longer. He consented and had food distributed to his new guests. A dance was held that night. After the dance and when the village had gone to sleep, the Natchez, Chickasaw and Koroa attacked their hosts. Cahura-Joligo killed four Natchez during the fighting, but was killed along with 12 of his warriors. His war chief &quot;Brides les Boeufs&quot; (Buffalo Tamer) repulsed the attack. He rallied the warriors, and after fighting for five days and nights, regained control of the village. Twenty Tunica were killed and as many wounded in the fighting. They killed 33 of the Natchez warriors.

After the attack at Angola, in 1731 the Tunica moved a few miles away to the Trudeau site. Over the years, they buried as grave goods large amounts of European trade goods, including beads, porcelain, muskets, kettles, and other items, as well as locally produced Tunica pottery and imported pottery. When discovered in the 20th century, these artifacts attested to their extensive trade with Europeans, as well as the wealth of the Tunica.

They stayed at this location into the 1760s, when the French ceded control west of the Mississippi to the Spanish following the French defeat by the British in the Seven Years&#x27; War.
In 1764 the Tunica moved south of the Trudeau Landing site to just outside the French settlement at Pointe Coupée, Louisiana. Other tribes had also settled in the area, including the Offagoula, Pascagoula and Biloxi. The latter came to have a close relationship with the Tunica people. During this time, numerous Anglo-American settlers migrated into the region, as the British had taken over former French territories east of the Mississippi River. The Tunica had become acculturated to European ways, although they still tattooed themselves and practiced some of their native religious customs. With the British in charge of the Western Florida colony at this time, and the Spanish in control of Louisiana, politics were volatile in the area. In 1779 Governor Galvez led a force, which included Tunica and other tribal warriors, to take the British-held town of Baton Rouge. This was the last military campaign for which the Tunica were recorded.

By sometime in the late 1780s or 1790s, the Tunica moved again, probably because of the large influx of Anglo-Americans moving into the area. They moved west to a site on the Red River named Avoyelles. In 1794 Marco Litche (recorded by the French as Marc Eliche), a Sephardic Jewish trader from Venice, established a trading post in the area. A European-American settlement developed around the post and became known as Marksville. It was noted on Louisiana maps as of 1809.

==After acquisition by US==
Marksville was a good location for a trading post, as the Red River was still an important avenue of trade. But rapid changes took place. Under Napoleon Bonaparte, France reacquired the area in 1800. After failing to regain power in its colony of Saint-Domingue, France sold the large territory known as the Louisiana Purchase to the fledgling United States in 1803. Anglo-Americans migrated to Louisiana in great numbers, mostly from the southern United States, eventually changing its culture to one dominated by the English language and Protestant Christianity, especially in the northern parts of the area. In the late 19th century, railroads surpassed the rivers as main avenues of trade and transportation, and the Marksville area became a quiet backwater.

The only U.S. government mention of the Tunica from 1803 to 1938 was made in 1806 by an Indian Commissioner for Louisiana. He noted that the Tunica numbered only about 25 men, lived in Avoyelles Parish, and made their livings by occasionally hiring out as boatmen. Although the Tunica were prosperous at this time, eventually problems with their white neighbors would take its toll. The whites imposed the binary social system based on slavery as a racial caste, recognizing only whites and blacks (in which they classified all people of color). They also tended to discount Indian identity among mixed-race people, failing to understand that they identified culturally and socially as Tunica. By the late 19th century, the dominant white conservative Democrats imposed legal racial segregation after disenfranchising blacks and other minorities of color. The Tunica became subsistence farmers, with some hunting and fishing to support themselves. Others turned to sharecropping on their white neighbors&#x27; land.

As the 20th century dawned, the Tunica came together around their ancient heritage. They had managed to retain possession of the majority of their communal land, some still spoke the Tunica language, and they still practiced traditional tribal ceremonies.

==20th century to present==

Gradually the remnant descendants of other local tribes (the Ofo, Avoyel, Choctaw, and Biloxi) merged into the Tunica. They have preserved much of their ethnic identity, maintaining their tribal government and the hereditary chieftainship up to the mid-1970s.

The modern Tunica-Biloxi tribe, which has a written constitution and elected government, was recognized by the federal government in 1981. They live in Mississippi and east central Louisiana. The modern tribe is composed of Tunica, Biloxi (a Siouan-speaking people from the Gulf coast), Ofo (also a Siouan people), Avoyel, and Mississippi Choctaw. Many live on the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Reservation in central Avoyelles Parish, just south of the city of Marksville, Louisiana. A part of the city extends onto reservation land.

The reservation has a land area of . Currently, they operate Louisiana&#x27;s first land based casino, Paragon Casino Resort, opened in Marksville in June 1994. The casino is known for its contributions back to its members. The 2000 census lists 648 persons identified as Tunica.

Tribal government currently consists of an elected tribal council and tribal chairman. The tribe maintains its own police force, health services, education department, housing authority, and court system. Former tribal chairman Earl J. Barbry Sr., was widely noted as one of the longest-serving chairmen in Indian Country, serving from 1978 until his death in July 2013. Barbry was succeeded as chairman by Marshall Pierite, formerly vice chairman of the tribe, from August 2013 through April 2014. Barbry&#x27;s son, Joey Barbry, served as chairman from April 2014. Marshall Pierite again became chairman upon his election in April 2018.

===Tunica treasure===

In the 1960s a treasure hunter named Leonard Charrier began searching for artifacts at the Trudeau Landing site in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. The Tunica, who felt he had stolen tribal heirlooms and desecrated the graves of their ancestors, were outraged.

In the 1970s the site was excavated by archaeologists, uncovering large amounts of pottery, European trade goods and other artifacts deposited as grave goods by the Tunica from 1731 to 1764 when they occupied the site. With help from the State of Louisiana, the tribe filed suit to gain title to the artifacts, which has subsequently become known as the &quot;Tunica treasure&quot;. The case took a decade to be decided in the courts, but the ruling became a landmark in American Indian history. It helped to lay the groundwork for new federal legislation, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), passed in 1990.

Because the artifacts had been separated from the original burials and connections were lost, the tribe decided to build a museum to house these items. Members of the tribe were trained as conservators in order to repair damage done to the artifacts by the centuries underground and handling during the ten-year court battle. The museum was built in the shape of the ancient temple mounds of their people, with the earthen structure to take the symbolic place of the original burial underground. It opened in 1989 as The Tunica-Biloxi Regional Indian Center and Museum. Due to structural problems, it was closed in 1999, with plans for a new larger facility underway. Today the Tunica Treasure collection is housed in the Tunica-Biloxi Cultural and Educational Resources Center, a state-of-the-art facility that includes a library, conservation center, distance-learning center, conference facilities, tribal offices, and museum on the tribal reservation in Marksville. Eighty percent of the artifacts of the Tunica Treasure have been restored.

===Federal recognition===
Formal efforts to be recognized by the federal government were begun in the 1940s when Chief Eli Barbry, Horace Pierite, Clarence Jackson, and Sam Barbry traveled to Washington, D.C. to consult with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Federal recognition would have entitled the tribe to benefit from social programs under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. A succession of chiefs, including Chief Horace Pierite Sr, would work at the task. With the Tunica treasure proving their ancient tribal identity, the tribe was able to gain state and federal recognition. They were recognized by the United States government in 1981 as the Tunica Biloxi Indians of Louisiana, later taking the name of Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe.

=== Economic development ===
The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe operates Louisiana&#x27;s first land-based casino, Paragon Casino Resort. It opened in Marksville in June 1994. It is now the largest employer in Avoyelles Parish.

The Tribe also owns and operates a Tribal Lending Enterprise—the online installment loan company, Mobiloans—and a finance and production company, Acacia Entertainment. Mobiloans works with Think Finance on underwriting, loan servicing, and other technology processes related to running the business. Acacia Entertainment is a joint venture between the Tribe&#x27;s Economic Development Corporation and film producer Matthew George. According to the Tribe, Acacia aims to produce two to three films per year.

==Tunica and Biloxi languages==
The Tunica (or Tonica, or less common form Yuron) language is a language isolate. The Tunica tribe historically lived close to the Ofo and Avoyeles tribes, but communication among the three depended on their use of the Mobilian Jargon or French.

The last known native speaker of the Tunica language, Sesostrie Youchigant, died in 1948. Linguist Mary Haas had worked with Youchigant in the 1930s to describe what he remembered of the language. She published the description in &quot;A Grammar of the Tunica Language&quot; in 1941, followed by &quot;Tunica Texts&quot; in 1950, and &quot;Tunica Dictionary&quot; in 1953. Tunica is a reawakening language, with immersion programs and youth summer camps teaching second-language learners.

The Biloxi language is a Siouan language which was at one time spoken by the Biloxi people in Louisiana and southeast Texas. The Biloxi were first noted in European records as living along the Biloxi Bay in the mid-17th century, but by the mid-18th century, they had migrated into Louisiana to avoid European encroachment. Some were also noted in Texas in the early 19th century. By the early 19th century their numbers had dwindled. In 1934, the last native speaker, Emma Jackson, was in her 80s. Morris Swadesh and Mary Haas met her on a linguistic survey trip in September 1934 and confirmed her status as a speaker of the language.

Most modern Tunica speak English, with a few older members speaking French as a first language.

<text>&quot;For other uses, see Chris Wallace (disambiguation).&quot;

Christopher Stewart Wallace (26 October 19337 August 2004) was an Australian computer scientist and physicist.

Wallace is notable for having devised:
* The minimum message length principle — an information-theoretic principle in statistics, econometrics, machine learning, inductive inference and knowledge discovery which can be seen both as a mathematical formalisation of Occam&#x27;s Razor and as an invariant Bayesian method of model selection and point estimation,
* The Wallace tree form of binary multiplier (1964),
* a variety of random number generators,
* a theory in physics and philosophy that entropy is not the arrow of time,
* a refrigeration system (from the 1950s, whose design is still in use in 2010),
* hardware for detecting and counting cosmic rays,
* design of computer operating systems,
* the notion of universality probability in mathematical logic,
* and a vast range of other works - see, e.g., and its &quot;Foreword re C. S. Wallace &quot;, pp 523-560.

He was appointed Foundation Chair of Information Science at Monash University in 1968 at the age of 34 (before the Department was re-named Computer Science), and Professor Emeritus in 1996. Wallace was a fellow of the Australian Computer Society and in 1995 he was appointed a fellow of the ACM &quot;For research in a number of areas in Computer Science including fast multiplication algorithm, minimum message length principle and its applications, random number generation, computer architecture, numerical solution of ODE&#x27;s, and contribution to Australian Computer Science.&quot;

Wallace received his PhD (in Physics) from the University of Sydney in 1959. He was married to Judy Ogilvie, the first secretary and programme librarian of SILLIAC, which was launched on the 12 of September 1956 at the University of Sydney and which was one of Australia&#x27;s first computers. He also engineered one of the world&#x27;s first Local Area Networks in the mid-1960s.

<doc id="1147239" wikidata="Q2574999" url="?curid=1147239" title="Agriculture in Russia">
<text>Agriculture in Russia is an important part of the economy of the Russian Federation. The agricultural sector survived a severe transition decline in the early 1990s as it struggled to transform from a command economy to a market-oriented system. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, large collective and state farms – the backbone of Soviet agriculture – had to contend with the sudden loss of state-guaranteed marketing and supply channels and a changing legal environment that created pressure for reorganization and restructuring. In less than ten years, livestock inventories declined by half, pulling down demand for feed grains, and the area planted to grains dropped by 25%.

The use of mineral fertilizer and other purchased inputs plummeted, driving yields down. Most farms could no longer afford to purchase new machinery and other capital investments. Following a nearly ten-year period of decline, Russian agriculture has experienced gradual ongoing improvement. The 2014 devaluation of the rouble and imposition of sanctions spurred domestic production; in 2016 Russia exceeded Soviet Russia&#x27;s grain production levels, and in that year became the world&#x27;s largest exporter of wheat. In the last years Russia has emerged as a big agricultural power again, despite also facing various challenges.

Geopolitical analyses of climate change adaptation foresee large opportunities for Russian agriculture during the rest of the 21st century as Siberia&#x27;s arability increases. Managing migration flows, internal and international, is expected to be a central aspect of the process.

* It was the 8th largest world producer of lentils (194 thousand tons);
* Produced 4 million tons of soy;
* Produced 1.9 million tons of watermelons
* Produced 627 thousand tons of grapes.

==Climate==
Russia experiences extreme temperatures in winter and summer, and summer precipitation is low. Many regions of Russia experience six months of snow cover each year and in these places the subsoil can often be frozen permanently. The most fertile regions are in the southern parts of the country between Kazakhstan and Ukraine called &quot;chernozem&quot; (&quot;black earth&quot;) in Russian. Just over 7% of the country&#x27;s total land is arable, 60% of which is used for cropland and the remainder for pasture.

Geopolitical analyses of climate change adaptation foresee large opportunities for Russian agriculture during the rest of the 21st century as Siberia&#x27;s arability increases. Managing migration flows, internal and international, is expected to be a central aspect of the process.

==Reduction of arable land==
The changes that began at the end of the 20th century greatly affected agriculture. Agricultural production has been sharply reduced; and there was a significant reduction in arable land in a number of regions.

Data on subjects of the Russian Federation:

Farmers are dissatisfied with the poor working and living conditions.
The number of rural settlements is constantly decreasing due to poor conditions. For example, 721 villages died out (from 18101 to 17380) in 2 years (from 1 January 2017 to 1 January 2019). Through numerous measures of the government in recent years private farmers became in comparison to the years of the nineties a relevant new pillar in Russian agriculture.

==Ownership and farm structure==

After the Soviet Union collectivised its agricultural sector during the Stalin years and until the 1980s, most agricultural land in Russia was in state ownership, and the transition to a market-oriented economy had to start with privatisation of land and farm assets. Russia&#x27;s agricultural privatisation programme can be traced back to 1989–90, when Soviet legislation under Gorbachev allowed, first, the creation of non-state business enterprises in the form of cooperatives; and second, legalized private ownership of land by individuals (the November 1990 Law of Land Reform). While household plots cultivated by employees of collective farms and other rural residents had played a key role in Russian agriculture since the 1930s, legislation enabling independent private farms outside the collectivist framework was passed only in November 1990.

The Law on Peasant Farms adopted in December 1990 was followed by laws and decrees that defined the legal organizational forms of large agricultural enterprises, the legal aspects of land ownership, and the procedures for certifying and exercising ownership rights. Specifically, agricultural land was denationalized, and its ownership (together with the ownership of other farm assets) legally transferred from the state to the ownership of kolkhozes. But at the same time the government
imposed a ten-year moratorium on buying and selling privately owned land.

The new legal environment created expectations among Western scholars and Russian reform-advocates that family farms would emerge in large numbers and the large-scale collective farms would be restructured. But as it turned out, few peasants were interested in establishing individual farms, and management- and operating-practices inside large agricultural enterprises remained largely unchanged despite formal reorganization. O&#x27;Brien and Wegren attribute this lack of enthusiasm for the creation of private farms to inadequate rural infrastructure, which did not provide processing and marketing services for small producers, and also to the fear that families striking out on their own might lose eligibility for social services that were traditionally provided by the local corporate farm instead of the municipality.

Starting in 1993, privatized kolkhoz and sovkhoz units became corporate farms. These farms were legally reorganized as common-stock companies, limited-liability partnerships, or agricultural-production cooperatives and were turned over, usually in their entirety, to the joint ownership of agricultural workers and pensioners. These farms continued to operate largely as they had done under the Soviet system. Today, the term &quot;corporate farm&quot; is an all-inclusive phrase describing the various organizational forms that arose in the process of privatisation without involving distribution of physical parcels of land to individuals.

In diametric opposition to corporate farms is the individual farm sector, which consists of the traditional household plots and the newly formed peasant farms.

The land-code reform of 2002, advanced by the administration of President Vladimir Putin, called for the ownership of real-estate objects to henceforth follow ownership of the attached land plot; granted exclusive right to purchase or lease state-owned land to the owner of the attached real-estate object; gave to private owners of buildings on land plots owned by other private parties the preemptive right to purchase the land; and prohibited the future privatization of real-estate objects without the concurrent privatization of the attached plot.

Russian agriculture today is characterized by three main types of farms. Two of these farm types – corporate farms and household plots – existed all through the Soviet period (the former are basically the successors of the Soviet collective (kolkhoz) and state (sovkhoz) farms). The third type – peasant farms – began to re-emerge only after 1990, during the post-Soviet transition. The evolution of Russian agriculture since 1990 shows a significant change of resources and production from the formerly dominant corporate farms to the individual farming sector. During 2006, household plots and peasant farms combined controlled about 20% of agricultural land and 48% of cattle, up from 2% of agricultural land and 17% of cattle in 1990. The share of the individual sector in gross agricultural output increased from 26% in 1990 to 59% in 2005. Producing 59% of agricultural output on 20% of land, individual farms achieve a much greater productivity than corporate farms.

Shares of agricultural land, cattle headcount, and gross agricultural output for farms of different types (in percent of respective totals)
During 2004, peasant farms accounted for 14.4% of Russia&#x27;s total grain production (up from 6.2% in 1997), 21.8% percent of sunflower seed (up from 10.8% five years earlier), and 10.1% of sugar beets (3.5% in 1997). Corporate farms produced the remainder of these crops, with hardly any contribution from the small household plots. However, household plots, with a maximum size of , produced 93% percent of the country&#x27;s potatoes and 80% of the vegetables, either for family consumption or for sale in the local markets. They also produced 51% of the milk and 54% of the meat in 2003, with the rest coming primarily from corporate farms (the contribution of peasant farms to livestock production was negligible).

===Household plots===

As the household plots gained more land in the process of reform, their share in Russia&#x27;s agricultural production increased from 26% of aggregate value in 1990 to 53% in 2005. According to a survey conducted in three Russian villages, the increase in land holdings and farm production tripled the nominal family income from 512 rubles per month in 1997 to 1,525 rubles per month in 1999 (this includes both cash income and the value of food that the family consumed from its household plot). The change in family income outstripped inflation, increasing by 18% in real terms (the Consumer Price Index grew by 252% between 1997 and 1999). This real growth in family income reduced the percentage of rural households living in poverty from 29% in 1997 to 17% in 1999.

==Planting and harvest dates==

The winter-crop planting season stretches over nearly three months. The sowing campaign begins in August in the north and advances southward, concluding in late October in the Southern provinces. Spring grain planting in European Russia usually begins in April and progresses from south to north. The &quot;summer&quot; crops—chiefly maize (corn) and sunflowers—are last to be sown, and planting approaches completion by late May or early June. The harvest of small grains (chiefly wheat and barley) moves from south to north and begins in late June in extreme southern Russia. Harvest operations are in full swing by early July and largely finished by mid-to-late August. Maize and sunflower harvest begins in September and continues through October. (View regional crop calendars.)

In the spring wheat region, planting typically begins in May. Oats are sown first, followed by wheat, then barley. Planting is concluded by June. Spring wheat advances through the reproductive stage during mid-July, when temperatures climb to their highest levels and grains are most vulnerable to heat stress. Grain harvest begins in late August and continues through October. It is not unusual for a significant portion of the Russian grain crop—millions of hectares in some years—to remain unharvested, due chiefly to unfavorable weather during the harvest campaign. In an average year, 10 percent of the area planted to spring wheat is abandoned compared to 97 percent of the country&#x27;s winter wheat area.

==Sectors - historical==

===Grain===
In 2016, Russia gained and exceeded Soviet grain production levels, and in that year became the world&#x27;s largest exporter of wheat.

====Exports====
==Farm credit==
While agricultural policy in Russia had been poorly structured and largely unsuccessful, some basic trends have helped to create forces for change. The first is that state tax revenues have been falling, and hence the spending capacity for agricultural policy has been falling. Total federal transfers to agriculture fell from 10% to 4% of GDP from 1992 to 1993, and budgeted transfers for 1994 are about 5% of GDP.

There has been improvement in the agricultural credit situation in Russia over the past five years – for some farms, at least – due largely to subsidies from the federal government. The national project for agriculture has given impetus to the growth of small farms. During 2006, 36 billion rubles in credit were given to more than 100,000 recipients (as compared to 3.4 billion rubles in credit to 2,500 borrowers in 2005). Traditional farms and personal plots play an important role in the sector, providing more than 87 percent of all production.

The State offers in-kind credits, whereby seed, fertilizer, and other inputs are provided in exchange for grain harvested at the end of the season, though the use of in-kind credit is reportedly decreasing. The government also provides subsidies for the purchase of plant-protection chemicals and fertilizers, and subsidizes two-thirds of the interest rate on loans from commercial banks, which provide the majority of farm credit. Banks remain cautious and insist on certain farm management practices and minimum levels of input use before granting loans (a policy which, according to some observers, has had a significant positive effect on overall efficiency in the agricultural sector), but banks&#x27; confidence is boosted by increasingly reliable guarantees from regional administrations who see stability of food production as a high priority. Banks recognize the inherent risk in agricultural financing but also see agriculture as less risky than other industries and are generally willing to lend money to solvent, well-managed farms.

Over fifty percent of Russia&#x27;s farms, however, are already saddled with considerable debt, due in part to the disparity between grain prices and production costs, and few farms are able to offer sufficient collateral to secure a loan. As a result, many farms are forced to rely on outside investors to guarantee loans. These investors, frequently referred to as holding companies, typically are large, cash-rich, traditionally non-agricultural companies that became involved in agriculture over the past five years. Some viewed crop production as a potentially highly profitable venture, and others were working to guarantee raw materials for vertically integrated food-processing operations.

Holding companies possess assets that satisfy banks&#x27; demand for collateral, and a farm that receives a commercial loan with the help of a holding company is still eligible for the federal interest subsidy. Many holding companies, particularly those who were attracted to agriculture by the high grain prices during 2000, have lost interest in crop production following two years of low prices and are bailing out. Investments in crop production don&#x27;t pay off quickly, in contrast to investments in trade. Although some holding companies remain comfortable with the variable profitability of agriculture and will continue to work with farms, several prominent commodity analysts feel that the overall involvement of big companies in agriculture is declining.

This means that current prospects for significant, long-term investment in agriculture – particularly the purchase of agricultural machinery and grain-storage facilities – are somewhat dim. Land reform has been evolving in Russia since the basic right to own farmland was established in 1993, but &quot;landowners&quot; are still unable to use land as collateral in securing a loan. The situation, however, is not one that can be resolved quickly or easily through legislation alone.

There is no mechanism currently in place to enable banks to evaluate the value of land based on its productivity before issuing loans, and banks likely would be reluctant to use land as collateral regardless of legislation. Furthermore, there are restrictions against non-agricultural use of land that is currently used for agriculture: if land is used for other purposes, the owner loses the title to the land. This imposes a limit on the land&#x27;s &quot;re-sellability,&quot; and, in turn, its value. The use of land as collateral appears to be a remote prospect.

==Investments==
Investments in fixed capital within the agricultural sector were US$10.17 billion in 2010, which is 3.3% of total investments in the national economy of Russia. Most investments occurred in corporate farming, where about 47.2% of the investments were allocated to production buildings and 36.4% in machinery and technological equipments. Financing of investments was shared by own financial means (49%) and by external means (51%).

===State investment program===
In December 2006, the State Duma passed a law requiring a state program for investment in agriculture to be passed every five years. This is the first of those programs. Between 2003 and 2007, agriculture received 37.1 billion rubles&#x27; support per year.

==Governance and economy of Russian agriculture==
As non-agricultural sectors grew more rapidly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the share of agriculture in total GDP in Russia decreased from 14.3% in 1991 to 4% in 2011. The agricultural sector accounted for 6.71% of total employment in 2015.

The importance of Russia&#x27;s grain exports in the global market, especially related to oilseeds and wheat, meant that during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine sanctions and disruptions to trade from Ukraine caused a significant increase in global grain prices, with some commentators suggesting that the war would precipitate a 2022 food crises.

In 2024, Russian farmers announced plans to reduce wheat cultivation following significant losses earlier in the year. Many farmers intend to shift to more profitable crops, such as peas, lentils, and sunflowers, citing better financial returns and lower risks. This decision reflects broader economic challenges and changing agricultural trends in the region.

==Pests==
===Fusaria===
The Luxembourg Microbial Culture Collection&#x27;s European Fusarium Database has information on &quot;Fusaria&quot; found in the country by sample date, species, chemotype, and host (and previous crop if known).

===Weeds===
====&quot;Chondrilla juncea&quot;====
Native here, &quot;C. juncea&quot; is an invasive weed in North America and eastern Australia. A fungus specialised to &quot;Chondrilla&quot; spp., &quot;Puccinia chondrillina&quot;, is found throughout &quot;C. juncea&quot;&#x27;s native range including here. It is being used as a biocontrol in its introduced range.

<text>The National Gain (Swedish title: &quot;Den Nationnale Winsten&quot;) is the main work of the Swedish-Finnish scientist, philosopher and politician Anders Chydenius, published in 1765. In this thesis Chydenius argues in favour of free export trade rights for the province of Ostrobothnia and lays down the principles of liberalism and the free markets – for example, free trade and industry – eleven years before Adam Smith in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776).
The book also includes a description of what Smith later dubbed the &quot;invisible hand&quot;. In the book, Chydenius attacks the export subsidy as an example of the harmful effects of government intervention on the domestic economy.

<text>Oxford () is a small town serving the farming community of North Canterbury, New Zealand. It is part of the Waimakariri District and is a linear town, approximately long. Oxford has won awards for the most beautiful village and the most beautiful toilet.

==Toponymy==
It is unclear whether the town is named after Oxford in England or after its university, but it is more probable that it was named after Samuel Wilberforce, who was the Bishop of Oxford from 1845 to 1870. It was named by the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, in 1849.

The town of Tīrau in the North Island was originally also named Oxford, in a name pairing with Cambridge 30 km to the west. Owing to confusion between the two towns, the North Island town was later renamed Oxford North before adopting its current name in 1895.

== History ==

It was originally a logging town: trees were felled from forests in the area, and hauled by beast to Christchurch. A mural depicting life from that era is painted on the side wall of the butchers shop.

=== Transport ===
Originally, it was served by the Oxford Branch railway, and had two stations, East Oxford and West Oxford. The line closed in 1959 and was dismantled. Some railway signs and the remnants of railway platforms can still be seen along Oxford Road on the way to Rangiora.

Oxford was linked to Christchurch in 1878 by the narrow-gauge Oxford Branch from Oxford West to Rangiora to meet the broad gauge from Christchurch. With the gauge conversion of 1878, it became easier to transfer passengers and freight from the branch line to Christchurch, though passengers still had to change at Rangiora from the Waipara train to the branch train. The branch stretched from Rangiora through Bennetts Junction (where the Eyreton Branch joined), Oxford and Sheffield. This necessitated a high road-rail bridge across the Waimakariri Gorge.

From Oxford to Sheffield closed in 1931 along with the Eyreton Branch, leaving the Oxford branch as a rural branch line. It lost its passenger service in the 1940s. Due to declining revenue, the branch closed on 31 May 1959 and the track was sold to Scotts Engineering of Christchurch, which used the rails from several branch lines to build farm sheds.

The line was latterly worked by the A and AB class 4-6-2 and C class 2-6-2 tender locomotives. No diesel locomotives or railcars are known to have used the branch, although thought was given in the 1940s to running a small railcar.
=== Renovation of Main Street ===
During 2009, Main Street underwent a major renovation with the road resurfaced, pedestrian refuges in strategic locations and new footpaths with garden beds. The old welcome signs were replaced with new &quot;Experience Oxford&quot; signs at east and west entries. This project was a joint undertaking by the Waimakariri District Council and the Oxford Promotions and Action Committee (OPAC), but they ran out of money and did not finish both sides of the street.

== Geography ==
Oxford is located at the inland edge of the Canterbury Plains, approximately 50 km northwest of Christchurch. The township is about 30 km from Rangiora to the East, and the townships of Sheffield and Darfield to the west.

The climate of Oxford is warm and temperate. Snowfalls are rare, but surrounding hills get snowfall on an annual basis.

=== Oxford Forest Conservation Area ===

The Oxford Forest Conservation Area is a protected forest area of 11,350 ha (28,000 acres) located in foothills near the township. The forest is a remnant of extensive beech and podocarp forests that previously covered inland parts of North Canterbury. It includes walking and mountain biking tracks and is a recreational hunting area. In 2024, the conservation area was designated by DarkSky International as New Zealand’s second International Dark Sky Park.

== Demographics ==
Oxford covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. 
Oxford had a population of 2,214 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 285 people (14.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 486 people (28.1%) since the 2006 census. There were 858 households, comprising 1,068 males and 1,146 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.93 males per female. The median age was 45.1 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 456 people (20.6%) aged under 15 years, 309 (14.0%) aged 15 to 29, 909 (41.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 540 (24.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 95.3% European/Pākehā, 6.6% Māori, 0.9% Pasifika, 1.5% Asian, and 2.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 19.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 52.6% had no religion, 36.2% were Christian, 0.1% were Hindu, 0.1% were Buddhist and 2.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 234 (13.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 435 (24.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,900, compared with $31,800 nationally. 228 people (13.0%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 729 (41.5%) people were employed full-time, 288 (16.4%) were part-time, and 54 (3.1%) were unemployed.

== Community and culture ==

The community saved hard during 2005 and 2006 to raise funds for projects such as the Oxford Community Pool, a community-based swimming pool in Burnett Street, and a first-response ambulance. The town prides itself on its ability to self-fund community projects through organisations such as the Lions.

=== Organisations ===
Oxford has several Churches and community organisations:
*Waimak Bible Chapel (Bible Fellowship)
*Oxford Union Church (Presbyterian)
*Oxford Baptist Church
*Sacred Heart Catholic Church
*Seventh Day Adventist Church
*Anglican Church
*Tawera Masonic Lodge
*Oxford Working Men’s Club
*West Oxford Hotel (Public House - The West)

=== Oxford Benevolent and Improvement League ===

The OB&amp;I was formed during World War I to provide charitable support to war widows. To raise money, it showed films in the old Oxford Town Hall. It provides charitable support to the citizens of Oxford. Movies are screened in the Town Hall approximately every other Saturday during the winter. The heyday of the OB&amp;I movies was the middle of the 20th century, when three or four films would be shown every week and queues often extended around the building. This was before private car ownership became popular, as the nearest cinema was in Christchurch, some 50 km distant.

In late 2011, the Oxford Town Hall where movies had been shown was closed, along with several other Council operated buildings, as the building was determined to be earthquake prone. The Oxford Town hall was reopened on 19 February 2015.

=== Books about Oxford ===
There are a number of books about Oxford. &quot;Littledene: a New Zealand rural community&quot; published in 1938 is perhaps the most comprehensive; the book is a &quot;sociological study of a typical New Zealand small town&quot;, with the fictional name of Littledene, but the research and details of the book all relate to Oxford.

==Education==
The town has one school, Oxford Area School. It is a state composite (Year 1–13) school with a role of

<text>Frederick the Fair () or the Handsome ( – 13 January 1330), from the House of Habsburg, was the duke of Austria and Styria from 1308 as well as the anti-king of Germany from 1314 until 1325 and then co-king until his death.

==Background==
Frederick was born in Vienna, the second son of King Albert I of Germany by his wife Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol, a scion of the Meinhardiner dynasty, and thereby a grandson of the first Habsburg king of Germany Rudolph I.

==Duke of Austria==
Still a minor, he and his elder brother Rudolph III had been vested with the duchies of Austria and Styria by their father in 1298. Upon Rudolph&#x27;s early death in 1307 and the assassination of his father in 1308, he became the ruler of the Austrian and Styrian duchies on behalf of himself and his younger brothers. The royal title held by his father and grandfather however passed to Count Henry VII of Luxembourg, who was elected by six of seven votes, contrived by the mighty Archchancellor Peter of Aspelt, elector and prince-archbishop of Mainz, a fierce opponent of late King Albert. Frederick had to abjure all claims to the German crown and in turn received the official affirmation of his fiefs by King Henry.

Originally, he was a friend of his cousin Louis IV of Bavaria, who also had been raised at the Austrian court in Vienna. However, armed conflict arose between them when tutelage over the young sons of Louis&#x27; cousin, late Duke Stephen I of Lower Bavaria was entrusted to Frederick by local nobles in 1313. Frederick took the occasion to enlarge his reach of power, invaded the Bavarian lands, but was beaten by Louis at the Battle of Gammelsdorf on 9 November 1313, and had to renounce the tutelage.

==Double election of 1314==

Meanwhile, Henry VII had been crowned emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312, but he died in the following year. As his son King John of Bohemia, seemed too powerful to the prince-electors, Frederick again became a candidate for the crown, while King John withdrew and backed Louis IV of Bavaria. On 19 October 1314 at Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen, Frederick received four out of seven votes, however two of them being contested, by Archbishop Henry II of Cologne, by Louis&#x27; brother Elector Palatine Rudolph I who did not want to support his younger brother, by the deposed Bohemian king Henry of Carinthia, and Duke Rudolph I of Saxe-Wittenberg (whose right was contested by his Lauenburg cousin, head of the senior branch). The next day however (because the Luxemburg party did not accept this election), a second election was held upon the instigation of Archbishop Peter von Aspelt, where Louis IV was elected with the five votes by the Mainz archbishop himself, by Archbishop Baldwin of Trier, Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg as well as by Duke John II of Saxe-Lauenburg (he contested his Wittenberg cousin&#x27;s claim to the electoral vote) and – again – the king of Bohemia, John. It is clear that at least three of the voters of Louis were uncontested electors.

Louis made use of the conflict around the Bohemian throne and the rivalry over the Saxon electoral dignity between the Ascanian duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg and Saxe-Lauenburg. Henry of Carinthia voting for Frederick actually only claimed the electoral power, as he had already been deposed in 1310 by John voting for Louis. Duke John II of Saxe-Lauenburg in turn sought to prevail against his cousin Duke Rudolph I of Saxe-Wittenberg – which ultimately failed as the 1338 Declaration of Rhense and the Golden Bull of 1356 conclusively named the dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg as electors.

Louis then was quickly crowned at Aachen Cathedral by Archbishop Peter von Aspelt, while Frederick was forced to proceed to Bonn Minster for his coronation on 25 November 1314 by the Cologne archbishop Heinrich von Virneburg. Both tried for the support by the Imperial States; Frederick was enfeebled by the fact that he had been crowned at the wrong place and moreover struggled with the rebellious Swiss Confederacy in the Swabian home territories of the Habsburgs, suffering a crushing defeat at the 1315 Battle of Morgarten. He nevertheless was able to hold his ground against the Wittelsbach rival and after several years of bloody war, victory finally seemed to be within Frederick&#x27;s grasp, as he was strongly supported by the forces of his younger brother Leopold I. However, Frederick&#x27;s army was in the end completely beaten near Mühldorf on Ampfing Heath on 28 September 1322, and Frederick and 1,300 nobles from Austria and the allied Archbishopric of Salzburg were captured.

==Reconciliation==
Louis held Frederick captive at Trausnitz Castle in the Upper Palatinate for three years, but the persistent resistance by Frederick&#x27;s brother Leopold, the retreat of King John of Bohemia from his alliance and a ban by Pope John XXII induced Louis to release him under the Treaty of Trausnitz of 13 March 1325. In this agreement, Frederick finally recognized Louis as legitimate ruler and undertook to return to captivity if he did not succeed in convincing his younger brothers to submit to Louis. As he did not manage to overcome Leopold&#x27;s obstinacy, Frederick returned to Munich as a prisoner, even though the Pope had released him from his oath. Impressed by Frederick&#x27;s noble gesture, Louis renewed the old friendship with Frederick and they agreed to rule the Holy Roman Empire jointly. Since the Pope and the prince-electors strongly objected to this agreement, another treaty was signed at Ulm on 7 January 1326, according to which Frederick would govern Germany as king, while Louis would be crowned emperor by the &quot;people of Rome&quot; under Sciarra Colonna in 1328.

After Leopold&#x27;s death in 1326, Frederick withdrew from ruling Germany and returned to rule only in Austria and Styria. He died on 13 January 1330, at Gutenstein Castle in the Wienerwald range, and was buried at Mauerbach Charterhouse, which he had founded. After the charterhouse was closed down in 1782, his remains were brought to the Ducal Crypt at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna.

Frederick&#x27;s gracious return to captivity inspired Friedrich Schiller to write his poem &quot;Deutsche Treue&quot; (&quot;German Loyalty&quot;) and Uhland to his tragedy &quot;Ludwig der Bayer&quot; (&quot;Louis the Bavarian&quot;).

==Marriage and issue==
On 11 May 1315 Frederick had married Isabella of Aragon, daughter of King James II of Aragon with Blanche of Anjou, an ambitious woman with an immense dowry. They had one son, who was born in 1316 but he died in 1322.

Their daughters:
* Elizabeth was born in 1317 and she died in 1336.
* Anna was born in 1318, and married the Wittelsbach duke Henry XV of Bavaria in 1328. The marriage was childless. Henry died in 1333. Her second husband was Count John Henry IV of Gorizia. This marriage was also childless and John died in 1338. Anne died in 1343.

Frederick was succeeded in Austria and Styria by his younger brothers Albert II and Otto. It took the Habsburgs more than a century to regain the royal crown, when Albert&#x27;s II great-grandson Albert V of Austria ascended to the German throne in 1438.

<text>The British Rail Class 487 electric multiple units were built by English Electric in 1940, for use on the Waterloo &amp; City line.

Twelve motor carriages (DMBSO), numbered 51–62, and sixteen trailers (TSO), numbered 71–86, were built. Trains were in various formations, from a single motor carriage, to pairs of motor cars with up to three intermediate trailers.

They were originally classified Class 453 under TOPS but were later reclassified Class 487.

The Waterloo &amp; City line was operated as part of the BR Southern Region. Stock was painted in British Railways green livery, which was replaced by Rail Blue in the 1970s, a version of all over blue with grey detailing. In 1986, the line came under the ownership of Network SouthEast, and their blue, red and white livery was applied.

The Class 487 units were unique on the British Rail network for a couple of reasons. They did not feature the normal yellow ends because the route they operated was entirely in tunnels where the darkness would render them pointless and the line did not integrate at all with the rest of the network. The units were only fitted with red lights at the ends, thus the front of the train displayed two red lights instead of the more usual white.

By the 1990s the units were urgently in need of replacing. This came in the form of new Class 482 two-car units, which were delivered to traffic in 1992/93. The final Class 487 vehicles were taken by road to Glasgow for scrap, which was their single longest journey above ground. One vehicle, DMBSO no. 61, was initially stored at the National Railway Museum in York, before being transferred to the London Transport Museum&#x27;s Acton Depot. This vehicle has had a major internal and external restoration by the London Transport Museum to have it in the condition it was on the day it left service in 1993.

<text>Matthew Green (1696–1737) was a British poet born of Nonconformist parents. For many years he held a post in the custom house. The few anecdotes that have been preserved show him to have been as witty as his poems would lead one to expect: on one occasion, when the government was about to cut off funds that paid for milk for the custom house cats, Green submitted a petition in their name, winning a reprieve. He died unmarried at his lodging in Nag&#x27;s Head Court, Gracechurch Street, London, in 1737.

His &quot;Grotto&quot;, a poem on Queen Caroline&#x27;s grotto at Richmond was printed in 1732; and his chief poem, &quot;The Spleen&quot;, in 1737 with a preface by his friend Richard Glover. These and some other short poems were printed in Robert Dodsley&#x27;s collection (1748), and subsequently in various editions of the British poets. They were edited in 1796 with a preface by John Aikin and in 1854 by Robert Aris Willmott with the poems of Thomas Gray and others. &quot;The Spleen&quot;, which was not originally intended for publication, is an epistle to Cuthbert Jackson, advocating cheerfulness, exercise and a quiet content as remedies. It is full of witty sayings. Thomas Gray said of it: &quot;There is a profusion of wit everywhere; reading would have formed his judgment, and harmonized his verse, for even his wood-notes often break out into strains of real poetry and music&quot;. Despite this praise, Green is thought of as a &quot;one-poem&quot; poet, to the point that he became known as &quot;Spleen-Green.&quot;

In an age of orthodoxy, Green had an original turn of mind. His idiosyncratic conversation &#x27;occasioned one of the commissioners of the Customs, a very dull man, to observe that he did not know how it was, but Green always expressed himself in a different manner from other people&#x27;.

Green is perhaps best remembered (if at all) for witty aphorisms, such as:

* &quot;By happy alchemy of mind / They turn to pleasure all they find.&quot;
* &quot;Laugh and be well.&quot;
* &quot;Fling but a stone, the giant dies.&quot; (&quot;The Spleen&quot;)
* &quot;Though pleased to see the dolphins play / I mind my compass and my way.&quot; (&quot;The Spleen&quot;)

<text>Luigino Rinaldi (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2011 and again from 2014 to 2018 who represented the ridings of Northumberland and Northumberland—Quinte West.

==Background==
Rinaldi moved to Canada with his family in 1960. He received an automotive technology diploma from George Brown College, and started a small business in the automotive field in 1972. He moved to Brighton, Ontario in 1980, having purchased Brighton Speedway, a family entertainment venue.

==Politics==
Rinaldi was appointed to council in the former Brighton township in 1992. He subsequently won election to the same position. He was elected as deputy reeve and was appointed reeve of the township in 1998. In 2000 he was elected mayor of the newly amalgamated municipality of Brighton. As mayor, he presided over the establishment of the Brighton Health Services Centre in the community.

In the provincial election of 2003, Rinaldi defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Doug Galt by about 2500 votes to become the new Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Northumberland. The Liberals won the election, and Rinaldi was named Parliamentary Assistant (PA) to David Caplan, the Minister of Infrastructure, on October 23, 2003. He was re-elected in the provincial election of 2007 in the newly redistributed riding of Northumberland—Quinte West. He was appointed as PA to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

In the provincial election of 2011 he was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Rob Milligan. In 2014, Rinaldi competed against Milligan again, this time defeating him by 3,887 votes.

In July 2014, he was reappointed as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

<doc id="1147273" wikidata="Q2872160" url="?curid=1147273" title="Australian Crawl">
<text>Australian Crawl (often called Aussie Crawl or The Crawl by fans) were an Australian rock band founded by James Reyne (lead vocals/piano/harmonica), Brad Robinson (rhythm guitar), Paul Williams (bass), Simon Binks (lead guitar) and David Reyne (drums) in Melbourne in 1978. David Reyne soon left and was replaced by Bill McDonough (drums, percussion). They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough (vocals, rhythm guitar). The band was named after the front crawl swimming style also known as the Australian crawl.

Australian Crawl were associated with surf music and sponsored a surfing competition in 1984. However, they also handled broader social issues such as shallow materialism, alcoholism, car accidents, and cautionary tales of romance.

After their 1980 debut album, &quot;The Boys Light Up&quot;, reached No. 4, Australian Crawl had two No. 1 albums; 1981&#x27;s &quot;Sirocco&quot; and 1982&#x27;s &quot;Sons of Beaches&quot;. Their early singles reached the top 25 but none broke into the Top Ten; their best performing single was No. 1 hit &quot;Reckless&quot; which showed a more mature approach than earlier hits, and came from their 1983 &quot;Semantics&quot; EP.

Upheaval within the band occurred from 1983 onwards. First, Bill McDonough left in 1983, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984 and finally, Paul Williams departed in 1985. Their 1985 release &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot; was expensive but sales were disappointing and they disbanded early in 1986. The band&#x27;s status as an icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Hospitalised with lymphoma, founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person. He died two weeks later.

==Biography==

===1975–1979: formation and &quot;Beautiful People&quot;===

The band Spiff Rouch formed in 1976 in the Mornington Peninsula suburb of Mount Eliza on the outskirts of Melbourne. The group lineup featured James Reyne, brothers Bill and Guy McDonough, Paul Williams, Robert Walker and Simon Binks. Reyne had previously played drums for Archie Slammit and the Doors.

By early 1978 Spiff Rouch had separated into two groups: The Flatheads (including the McDonough brothers and Walker, along with Sean Higgins and Nigel Spencer) and Australian Crawl. The original lineup for the latter was Reyne as vocalist, Binks on lead guitar, Williams on bass guitar, along with Reyne&#x27;s younger brother David Reyne on drums and schoolmate Brad Robinson on rhythm guitar. Australian Crawl performed their first live gig in October 1978 and toured the pub circuit.

David Reyne left the group in 1979 to finish his acting course, later becoming an actor and TV presenter as well as drumming for Cats Under Pressure and the Chantoozies (1986–1990). He was replaced in Australian Crawl by Bill McDonough. The group&#x27;s popularity in the Mornington Peninsula area increased with further pub gigs, then they gained audiences with university students and inner city residents.

Once the band&#x27;s escalating popularity brought them into Melbourne they caught the attention of Little River Band&#x27;s guitarist David Briggs, who helped them gain a recording contract with EMI and he produced their first single. &quot;Beautiful People&quot; (1979) reached No. 22 on the national charts. Reyne had co-written the song with guitarist Mark Hudson in 1975. The track included references to the shallow materialism of residents of Toorak and to the Bombay Rock night club in Brunswick.

Just days before recording &quot;Beautiful People&quot; Reyne had been hit by a car on Swanston Street, Melbourne, breaking bones in both wrists, an episode later chronicled in the track &quot;Indisposed&quot;. Australian Crawl made one of the most memorable debuts on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV series &quot;Countdown&quot; performing &quot;Beautiful People&quot; as Reyne still had both arms encased in plaster. &quot;Beautiful People&quot; remains one of their most popular songs according to listeners of Triple M in 2007.

===1980 &quot;The Boys Light Up&quot;===

Australian Crawl&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Boys Light Up&quot; (1980), also produced by Briggs for EMI, had a number of hit singles with songwriting shared around the group and beyond. Tracks from this album included the previously released single &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, the title track (written by Reyne and Mark Hudson); &quot;Indisposed&quot; (Brad Robinson, James Robinson, Reyne, Bill McDonough) and &quot;Downhearted&quot; (Sean Higgins, Guy McDonough, Bill McDonough) (from The Flatheads).

&quot;The Boys Light Up&quot;, their second single, was almost banned from radio play due to its explicit lyrics. Many listeners believed the chorus lyrics were about smoking marijuana but Reyne has stated that it was about smoking tobacco cigarettes at school. It also reached No. 22 on the National charts and became their signature song and their most popular track especially live. Their third single &quot;Downhearted&quot; charted higher at #12 and was a cautionary tale of romance gone wrong.

&quot;The Boys Light Up&quot; reached No. 4 on the Australian album charts and remained in the charts for an unbroken 101 weeks. It sold five times platinum: over 280,000 copies, and became one of the biggest Australian albums of the 1980s. 

Singer/guitarist/songwriter Guy McDonough (ex-The Flatheads and Bill&#x27;s younger brother) joined the group in October 1980.

Rock journalist and commentator Glenn A. Baker compared Australian Crawl with various fellow Australian bands:
However, according to James Reyne some people accused them of being demonic. He said whenever you bumped into the member of Little River Band who had found God, he&#x27;d tell him &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t be playing that, it&#x27;s demonic&quot;.

===1981–1982: &quot;Sirocco&quot; and &quot;Sons of Beaches&quot;===

In 1981, Australian Crawl recorded their second album, &quot;Sirocco&quot;, with producer Peter Dawkins in Sydney. Named for Errol Flynn&#x27;s yacht, the album peaked at No. 1 on the Australian album chart on 3 August and remained there for six weeks. At about this time Robinson was married to actress Kerry Armstrong, later an Australian Film Institute Award winner, who co-wrote a track &quot;Easy on Your Own&quot; for the album.

&quot;Sirocco&quot; spawned the hit singles &quot;Things Don&#x27;t Seem&quot; (May, No. 11 National charts) and &quot;Errol&quot; (August, #18). It also included &quot;Oh No Not You Again&quot; (November). Of these, &quot;Errol&quot; about womanising Tasmanian-born actor Flynn is the band&#x27;s third most popular song of all. Another track from the album, &quot;Lakeside&quot;, became a popular radio inclusion. 1981 Australian End of Year Album Charts has &quot;Sirocco&quot; at No. 2 behind &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; by John Lennon and ahead of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot; making it the best charting album by an Australian act.

Another track on this album, &quot;Unpublished Critics&quot; has been compared several times to the later song &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; by US band Guns N&#x27; Roses, as acknowledged by the writer of &quot;Unpublished Critics&quot;, James Reyne. He was responding to media comments in May 2015 about the possibility of plagiarism by the American band. Duff McKagan, who was bass player with Guns N&#x27; Roses when &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; was written and recorded, found the similarities between the songs &quot;stunning,&quot; but said he had not previously heard &quot;Unpublished Critics.&quot;

On the wave of popularity the band toured extensively playing to huge crowds at Melbourne&#x27;s Myer Music Bowl (10,000), Sydney&#x27;s Domain (90,000), the Narara Rock festival (70,000), smashing attendance records at indoor venues in Brisbane and Perth. They were voted &quot;Countdown&quot; 1981 Most Popular Group, and James Reyne was voted 1980 and 1981 Most Popular Male Performer.

&quot;Sons of Beaches&quot; (1982) was recorded in Hawaii with expatriate Australian Mike Chapman producing. The album had a rougher, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll edge than its glossy pop rock predecessors and featured the No. 17 hit &quot;Shut Down&quot; (June). It also included a re-recorded version of &quot;Downhearted&quot; and became their second album to reach No. 1 on the Australian albums chart and remained there for five weeks. EMI issued the album in the USA. Two further singles, &quot;Daughters of the Northern Coast&quot; (August) and &quot;Runaway Girls&quot; (November) failed to reach the Australian Top 40.

Over 1982 and 1983, Reyne was filmed with Australian actresses Rebecca Gilling and Wendy Hughes in the television miniseries &quot;Return to Eden&quot;, which was screened in September 1983. For Reyne&#x27;s role of playboy tennis professional Greg Marsden, he was given the 1984 &quot;Most Popular New Talent Award&quot; at the TV Week Logie Awards. Reyne later declared he was not very good in the part, declining many acting offers since. During breaks in filming, the singer accepted an offer from Paul Christie (Mondo Rock) and Kevin Borich to join their part-time band The Party Boys with Harvey James from Sherbet and Graham Bidstrup from The Angels. The group played a short run of shows around Sydney venues and played covers exclusively. The resultant album, &quot;Live at Several 21sts&quot;, peaked at No. 9 on the national chart.

===1983–1984: &quot;Reckless&quot;, &quot;Semantics&quot; and &quot;Phalanx&quot;===

Soon after Reyne finished acting for &quot;Return to Eden&quot;, Bill McDonough left due to tensions within the band. The remaining members then recorded the EP &quot;Semantics&quot; (1983) with Bidstrup (from The Party Boys, later a founder of GANGgajang) on drums. The four track EP contained their best-known song, &quot;Reckless&quot; (aka &quot;Don&#x27;t Be So Reckless&quot;, &quot;She Don&#x27;t Like That&quot;) which was written by Reyne, and went to No. 1 on the Australian singles chart on 28 November. John Watson (Kevin Borich Express) then came in as a permanent replacement for McDonough. The live album &quot;Phalanx&quot; was something of a stop-gap measure between studio albums, nevertheless it reached No. 4 during December. The band&#x27;s biggest overseas break came when Duran Duran took the band as support on certain legs of their &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot; tour of the UK.

US label Geffen Records signed Australian Crawl and issued &quot;Semantics&quot; (1984) as an album (with the four songs from the EP and re-recordings of tracks from past Australian records) for the international market. In April 1984 Australian Crawl became the first Australian band to sponsor an ASP surfing competition. The Rip Curl/Australian Crawl Bell&#x27;s Beach Surfing Festival was won by Australian surfer, Cheyne Horan.

In June 1984 the band was forced off the road when Guy McDonough was admitted to hospital in Melbourne; he died soon after of viral pneumonia. Australian Crawl regrouped with Mark Greig on guitar (ex-Runners) for a series of live performances in late 1984. Prior to Guy&#x27;s death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough (drums, percussion), Sean Higgins (synthesisers) and Nigel Spencer (bass, synthesisers), (all former The Flatheads); and Mick Hauser (saxophone) and Michael Bright (guitar). Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;My Place&quot; on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Singles &quot;My Place&quot; / &quot;Things Don&#x27;t Seem&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s in it For Me&quot; / &quot;Hook, Line and Sinker&quot; were also released. &quot;Things Don&#x27;t Seem&quot; written by Guy McDonough and Sean Higgins, had been released as an Australian Crawl single in 1981 off &quot;Sirocco&quot;. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; in 1996.

===1985–1986: &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, &quot;The Final Wave&quot; and split===

By 1985 the group recorded their last studio album, &quot;Between a Rock and a Hard Place&quot;, with English producer Adam Kidron. It was released in Australia on Australian Crawl&#x27;s own label Freestyle Records. The album, which allegedly cost $400,000 to record, was a mishmash of styles and -- considering the expectations placed on the LP&#x27;s sales -- a commercial disaster. (It peaked at No. 11 in August 1985 but slipped out of the Top 40 two weeks later; their previous two albums had hit #1, and received multi-platinum certifications.) None of the singles had any Top 40 chart success. Harry Brus (Kevin Borich Express) replaced long-standing bass player Paul Williams in May 1985. The band performed three songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert—part of the global Live Aid program—&quot;Reckless (Don&#x27;t Be So)&quot;, &quot;Two Can Play&quot; and &quot;The Boys Light Up&quot;. It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.

When the album virtually failed to chart, the band was ready to split but had to go out on tour to pay off its debts. On 27 January 1986, their final Melbourne concert was recorded and released as the live album &quot;The Final Wave&quot; in October. The band performed its final concert on 1 February at the Perth Entertainment Centre.

In seven years, Australian Crawl had sold over one million records in Australia, with five of its albums and an EP reaching the Australian Top 5 Album Charts, two of which had been No. 1 hits. A cumulative total of eleven weeks at Number 1 on the Albums Charts places them equal fourth for Australian groups behind Skyhooks, The Seekers and Midnight Oil.

===1986–1995: Solo careers===

In 1985, Lin Buckfield (Electric Pandas) and Reyne released a duet single &quot;R.O.C.K.&quot; / &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;. After Australian Crawl disbanded, Reyne went on to a solo career. His first few singles failed to chart but 1987&#x27;s &quot;Fall of Rome&quot; and the self-titled album that followed were the beginning of a string of hits that lasted until the early 1990s. In 1992 he and James Blundell had a hit with a cover of The Dingoes&#x27; &quot;Way Out West&quot; (#2, May 1992). Reyne also formed Company of Strangers that year with former Sherbet lead singer Daryl Braithwaite, Simon Hussey and Jef Scott. Company of Strangers only released one self-titled album, Company of Strangers in 1992, which produced the hits &quot;Motor City (I Get Lost)&quot; (#26, September 1992), &quot;Sweet Love&quot; (#21, January 1993) and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gonna Make You a Star&quot; (#35, March 1993).

In 1993 Reyne appeared as Tina Turner&#x27;s manager Roger Davies in &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to do With It?&quot;. He featured in twelve episodes of &quot;State Coroner&quot; during 1998 and in 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Postcard Bandit&quot;. Reyne lives on the Mornington Peninsula with his partner, Tina, and a daughter. He has released his eighth solo studio album, &quot;Every Man a King&quot; (2007) and still performs occasionally.

Almost immediately after the split Robinson became manager of Chantoozies (with early Crawl drummer David Reyne). Their first single, &quot;The Witch Queen of New Orleans&quot; (1986), a cover of Redbone&#x27;s song, reached No. 4 on the National charts. Robinson then moved into a career in television (with Network Ten&#x27;s &quot;Page One&quot;) and as a co-producer of documentaries. In the 1990s he became the manager for the Reyne brothers and worked as an agent for the Advantage Sports Management Group. This included managing Australian tennis player Mark Philippoussis. Three years after being diagnosed with lymphoma, Robinson died on 13 October 1996.

Paul Williams, who had left the band in 1985, played in the Broderick Smith Band in 1987 and has worked in music-related retail. Simon Binks and Mark Greig both played in the Broderick Smith Band in 1988. Simon Binks was injured in a 1995 car crash at a council roadworks that left him slightly brain-damaged. A court in 2006 awarded him $330,253 in damages, down from an estimated $750,000 because he was said to be over the legal limit. Binks later disputed the alcohol reading as belonging to another driver and stated the remuneration mostly went to his lawyers. A 2007 appeal by the council, saw amount awarded further reduced to $304,750.

===1996–present: ARIA Hall of Fame and compilations===

In 1996, a compilation titled &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; was released. It contained seven of the tracks from Guy McDonough&#x27;s solo album &quot;My Place&quot; which were remastered. Compilers and producers of &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; were Bill McDonough and Peter Blyton. &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; tracks from &quot;My Place&quot; include &quot;Too Many People&quot; a duet sung by Guy McDonough with Colin Hay of Men at Work. Some &quot;My Place&quot; tracks used on &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; have Reyne singing backing vocals. As of 2001, Bill McDonough left the music industry and began working in the construction industry and continues to own and operate his building and demolition companies in 2017.

The band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in September 1996. Three weeks later, Robinson died.

Additional compilation albums were released; &quot;More Wharf&quot; in 1998, &quot;&quot; in 2000 and &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; in 2002. &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; contained songs from the band and from James Reyne&#x27;s solo career.

In 2001, as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, the Australian Performing Right Association (APRA) compiled a list of the Top 30 Australian songs, with &quot;Reckless (Don&#x27;t Be So)&quot; coming in at number nineteen.

In October 2007, eleven Australian Crawl tracks were featured in the Triple M Essential 2007 Countdown of songs (positions are voted by listeners out of the best 2007 songs of all time). They were &quot;Hoochie Gucci Fiorucci Mama&quot; #1673; &quot;Lakeside&quot; #1354; &quot;Indisposed&quot; #956; &quot;Downhearted&quot; #728; &quot;Oh No Not You Again&quot; #587; &quot;Shut Down&quot; #415; &quot;Things Don&#x27;t Seem&quot; #371; &quot;Boys Light Up&quot; #305; &quot;Errol&quot; #227; &quot;Beautiful People&quot; #153; and &quot;Reckless&quot; #39.

In January 2014, Universal Music Australia celebrated the 35th anniversary of the release of &quot;Beautiful People&quot; by releasing &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;, which peaked at number 4 and was the 40th best selling album in Australian in 2014.

In October 2016, Australian Crawl released a seven album vinyl collection, titled &quot;The Album Collection&quot;. The collection included the band&#x27;s four studio albums, two live albums and the US-expanded version of the &quot;Semantics&quot; album which had previously been unavailable to Australian audiences.

<text>Politics is a 2003 novel by Adam Thirlwell about a father-daughter relationship and about a ménage à trois which includes said daughter and two of her friends. We are informed by the narrator that the novel is about &quot;goodness&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Nana, an attractive young &quot;non-talker&quot; in her mid-twenties—&quot;tall, thin, pale, blonde, breasty&quot;—who is working on her M.A. thesis, lives with her &quot;Papa&quot;, the &quot;benevolent angel&quot; of the story, in Edgware, a suburb of London. She gets to know Moshe, a young Jewish actor from Finsbury, and they start a relationship. As time goes by, Anjali, a friend of Moshe&#x27;s, joins them more and more in their spare-time activities until Nana, for whom sex is not necessarily a top priority, suggests a &quot;threesome&quot; because she wants Moshe to be happy.

Accordingly, due to Nana&#x27;s altruism, for some months Nana and Moshe are joined in their lovemaking by Anjali, who is bisexual. The narrator, who defines a threesome as &quot;the socialist utopia of sex&quot;, describes not only the sociology, psychology and ethics of their ménage à trois (for example by comparing it to the love triangle depicted in the film &quot;Cabaret&quot;) but also, in some detail, the technicalities and what he calls &quot;sexual etiquette&quot;. However, he also frequently ponders philosophical questions and occasionally redefines old concepts such as that of infidelity (&quot;the selfish desire to be helpful to more than one person&quot;).

In the summer Nana goes on holiday with her Papa, leaving behind two thirds of the ménage à trois. In Venice, Italy, Papa complains of a splitting headache, and shortly after their return to England he suffers a stroke—a good excuse for Nana to break up with both Moshe and Anjali, although her father is saddened by the thought of his daughter giving up her boyfriend on his account.

==Characters==
*Nana – protagonist
*Papa – Nana&#x27;s father
*Moshe – a Jewish actor 
*Anjali – a bisexual

==Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science==
The ramblings of the narrator and Nana&#x27;s interest in architecture lead to an impressive list of famous people being mentioned in the pages of &quot;Politics&quot;. Some are just briefly referred to, others are presented by means of an anecdote proving a point the narrator is trying to make. They include, in alphabetical order, Guillaume Apollinaire, Nikolai Bukharin, Mikhail Bulgakov, Antonio Gramsci, Václav Havel, Rem Koolhaas, Milan Kundera, Osip Mandelstam, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Issey Miyake, Józef Rotblat, Jonathan Sacks, Elsa Schiaparelli, Oscar Wilde, and Mao Zedong.

When rendering spoken language (see Estuary English), Thirlwell time and again uses pronunciation respelling. Accordingly, he has the protagonists say things like , , , (= for ages), &quot;I dint say&quot;, &quot;I spose&quot;, , (= chemo (as in chemotherapy)), , &quot;Not&quot; , , , &quot;snot&quot; (= it is not), and .

<text>The buisine and the añafil were variations of a type of straight medieval trumpet usually made of metal, also called a herald&#x27;s trumpet. While arguably the same instrument, the two names represent two separate traditions, in which a Persian-Arabic-Turkic instrument called the &quot;Nafir&quot; entered European culture in different places and times.

The term &quot;buisine&quot; (Old French; also, &quot;busine&quot;, &quot;buysine&quot;, &quot;buzine&quot;) descends from &quot;Buccina&quot;, a Roman military horn. The horn was mainly used for military and ceremonial purposes. When Europeans went to the crusades, the instrument was seen as a proper military target (in the same way a flag or pendant was), something to capture and bring home.

The term &quot;añafil&quot; descends from &quot;al-Nafir&quot;, the Persian-Arab Islamic trumpet which was used by Moorish armies in Spain, before the Crusades. By the Reconquista (722–1492) when residents of the future Spain retook the Iberian Peninsula, &quot;añafil&quot; was part of the nation&#x27;s language. The image that is among Europe&#x27;s earliest representation of the instrument came from this tradition, in the 13th century Spanish work, the &quot;Cantigas de Santa Maria&quot;.

The &quot;buisine&quot;—&quot;añafil&quot; is precursor of today&#x27;s [[fanfare trumpet]], it had a very long and slender body, usually one to two metres in length (some were reported to have been at least six feet in length) that tapered toward the end into a slightly flared bell. It is commonly seen in paintings being played by angels and often also bearing the banner of a nobleman. As the herald&#x27;s trumpet was widely used in Fanfares. These instruments would serve as a sort of timekeeper to announce events and meetings. Their long, tubed shape would allow them to hang flags and banners, which made them popular for events and ceremonies.

The term &quot;buisine&quot; is first found in the c1100 Chanson de Roland, and it was probably a general term for horns and trumpets rather than referring to a specific instrument. Early trumpets were slightly curved, but the term was applied c1300 to straight trumpets imported from the Middle East during the Crusades.

The modern German word for trombone, &quot;Posaune&quot;, is a corruption of &quot;buisine&quot; by way of &quot;busaun&quot;.

==History==
There were multiple different instruments that were used in the Middle Ages that can be described as medieval trumpets. Historians believe that the advancement of trumpets came from a variety of people. The use of animal horns were used as instruments in Oriental and Roman cultures. Advanced craftsman used these concepts to design the first metal instruments.

The &quot;anafil&quot; was introduced to the Iberian Peninsula at the time of the Muslim conquest which created Al-Andalus. and maintained for centuries the name Moorish &quot;nafil&quot;, since the Andalusian Arabs used it to execute the sharp parts of the fanfares and military touches. Later, it was introduced to Europe by the Saracen armies and the Christian armies of the Crusades.

The &quot;buisine&quot; is referenced as the forerunner of all brass instruments. The brass instrument known as the &quot;busine&quot; first appeared in Southern Italy in the 11th century. It was introduced in two forms; one with a conical, curved tube called the Cornu, and one with a straight, cylindrical shape. A smaller version of the &quot;buisine&quot;, known as the &quot;clarion&quot;, was also popular during these times. The clarion plays in the same register as its counterparts, but plays in a higher pitch due to its smaller structure. The Roman &quot;cornu&quot; was popular in Europe and the Orient, while the &quot;buisine&quot; and &quot;clarion&quot; were mostly used in England and France.

From the late Middle Ages, the &quot;anafil&quot; begins to lose its character as a war instrument to become a messenger and instrument of protocol. As an instrument of heraldry it took on courtly character in European courts. Progressively, the long tube of the anafil began to curve, and in the Renaissance it continues to curve in the shape of an &quot;S&quot; and twist into loops. By the early 1400s it had shifted into a double coiled S-shape, in one form being called the &quot;clarion.&quot; It evolved until it merged with the baroque trumpet, and was gradually assimilated by the new trumpets and bagpipes. In the 19th century this metal wind instrument incorporates keys and pistons that give it the appearance and functionality of today&#x27;s metal instruments.

At present it is a unique and characteristic instrument of the processions of the Semana Santa de Cabra (Córdoba), where it is called &quot;abejorro&quot; (bumblebee). Its modern equivalent is the &quot;nafīr&quot;, which in the Maghrib is sounded from the minarets in the month of Ramadan.

==Sound==
Unlike modern day trumpets, the buisine does not have piston or rotary valves to change pitches chromatically. This limited players to only set notes given within a specific harmonic series. The buisine makes a loud, buzzing sound which makes them so popular for events and ceremonies. The buisine, unlike coiled trumpets, sends vibration through the tube uninterrupted. This results in a louder sound as well as the sound appearing to come from a distance. The sound of buisine can be compared to that of a military bugle. The instrument plays in a lower register. The sound can be described as powerful, heroic, and substantial. The notes in this register come off as rounded and full. This register can go as low as C4. These notes come off as distinct, strong, and eerie. They are often used to help depict battle stories. The powerful, distinct notes in this register make this instrument useful for events and ceremonies. They are able to attract attention and employ feelings of royalty and power.

<text>The Rakiura Track is a circular tramping track in Rakiura National Park on Stewart Island in New Zealand. It is one of the New Zealand Great Walks. Hikers often take three days to walk it, but it can be done in one or two days.

One end is at Lee Bay, north of Oban (Stewart Island&#x27;s only settlement), and the other end is at Fern Gully, west of Oban. It can be walked either way, but is most often walked anticlockwise, starting at Lee Bay. Hikers can arrange transport from Oban over the roads to and from the ends of the track, or can walk along the roads.

The track generally follows the coastline for a large part of its length, passing small inlets, large bays and mudflats, and crosses steep hills covered in bush (dense forest) in its middle section. Large sections of the track have been gravelled. Without this, much of the track would degrade into mud, due to the peaty soil, and the rain that falls frequently throughout the year. In general, the track is well-maintained, and of easy to medium difficulty. Walking the track offers the unusual opportunity to see kiwi in the wild. The species on Stewart Island is the southern brown kiwi (&quot;Apteryx australis&quot;).

There are two huts on the track, at Port William and the North Arm of Paterson Inlet, and many hikers sleep overnight at each. There are also campsites at Maori Beach, Port William and North Arm. The huts and campsites have toilets and water supply, and the huts have bunks and mattresses. Toilet paper is not provided and hikers must bring their own. There are no cooking facilities, so trampers are advised to carry their own stoves and cooking equipment. Gas canisters and other supplies can be purchased at a store in Oban before setting out. The huts are supplied with firewood, which is flown in by helicopter, as there are no roads to the huts, and trampers are not allowed to cut firewood. The huts and campsites must be booked in advance.

Rakiura Track has been covered by Google Street View since November 2015.

<text>Temuka is a town on New Zealand&#x27;s Canterbury Plains, 15 kilometres north of Timaru and 142 km south of Christchurch. It is located at the centre of a rich sheep and dairy farming region, for which it is a service town. It lies on the north bank of the Temuka River, just above its confluence with the Ōpihi River.

Temuka is the second largest town in South Canterbury after Timaru. Temuka is home to three schools, two primary schools and one secondary school. Temuka is accessed by New Zealand&#x27;s State Highway Number 1 and the Main South Line railway allowing for major cargo handling. Temuka is north of the Opihi and Temuka rivers. The local secondary school, Opihi College, takes its name from the Opihi River. Both rivers are popular with locals and tourists. Almost all traffic passing north or south goes through or around Temuka. Temuka has recently had the redevelopment of the local Domain by incorporating a skate park to join the other facilities which include a swimming pool, mini golf, golf, netball, outdoor bowls and tennis. There are also rugby and football fields, a stadium complex and a holiday park.

==History ==
The name &quot;Temuka&quot;, or &quot;Te Muka&quot;, is a corruption of , which is thought to mean either &#x27;fierce ovens&#x27; or &#x27;strong current&#x27;. The fierce ovens would be the large earth ovens () that Māori used to cook the roots of plentifully-growing cabbage trees. Temuka was originally called Wallingford. 

Temuka was gazetted as a town in 1858. The first survey was conducted in 1863. The first buildings were erected in 1860. Initial industries included a tannery works, a cheese factory, a flour mill and potteries. The police barracks were built in 1863 and the telegraph office was opened in 1868. In 1878, the Oddfellows lodge and the St George Masonic lodge were opened. The Temuka town board was constituted in 1884. In 1899, Wallingford and Arowhenua town districts were incorporated into the borough of Temuka. 

The population of Temuka was 1465 people in 1901. Temuka was described in 1903 as having two doctors, two chemists and one dentist in the town, which has a well kept park and domain, with a bicycle track, and tennis, cricket and football grounds. The two storied post and telegraph office was opened in 1902 by Sir Joseph Ward. 

Temuka was a stop on the Main South Line until passenger services were discontinued. At one time Temuka supported wool scouring plants, it had a flour mill and manufactured electric power transmission insulators.

Temuka was hit by a significant flood on March 13, 1986, with Temuka being isolated after the bridge crossing State Highway 1 being washed out. 

Temuka previously had its own council system in place, but has been under the administration of Timaru District Council since 1989. Recently, the council has been redeveloping Temuka in the form of cleaning waterways, new walkways, redeveloping of existing walkways, new gardens, domains, new tennis courts, complete skate park and general modernisation of the large service town.

<text>The Rutan Model 40 Defiant is a four-seat, twin-engine homebuilt aircraft with the engines in a push-pull configuration. It was designed by aerospace engineer Burt Rutan for the Rutan Aircraft Factory.

==Development==

The prototype Defiant, N78RA, was first flown on 30 June 1978. It had been intended as a proof-of-concept of a very safe light twin design, requiring little trim change and no pilot action in case of engine failure, and with good single engine performance. A comparison of the Defiant single engine climb rate with a Gulfstream Cougar had shown about vs per minute at low altitude with both aircraft in a clean, gear up and flaps up, configuration. The prototype is now owned by the Hiller Aviation Museum.

In 1979 the Rutan Aircraft Factory announced they would proceed with certification of a Defiant-based light twin. Adequate financing was not secured for this project, and the design was modified for homebuilt construction as the Model 74, with the second aircraft (built by Fred Keller) appearing at Oshkosh 1983. Plans were offered in mid-1984. 176 sets of plans were purchased before RAF discontinued selling plans in 1985. Nine examples were known to be flying as of mid-1987. Nineteen are registered with the FAA as of 2005.

==Design==
The Defiant is built using fiberglass layup over Styrofoam core shapes in the same manner as the Rutan VariEze. The main gear is fixed, and there are no flaps. The Propellers are fixed-pitch non-feathering, which is unusual in a twin-engine design. Cockpit entry is through a side hinged canopy. The winglets provide yaw stability. Unusually, the Defiant has a ventral, port offset, forward mounted rudder, as can be seen in pictures of the plane taxiing.

<doc id="1147293" wikidata="Q352748" url="?curid=1147293" title="John Spencer (actor)">
<text>John Spencer (born John Speshock Jr.; December 20, 1946 – December 16, 2005) was an American actor. He was best known for his role as Leo McGarry on the NBC political drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot; and for his role as attorney Tommy Mullaney in &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. His performance on &quot;The West Wing&quot; earned him a Primetime Emmy Award in 2002.

==Early life==
John Spencer was born John Speshock Jr., on December 20, 1946, in New York City, and was raised in Totowa, New Jersey. He was the son of blue-collar parents Mildred (née Benzeroski), a waitress, and John Speshock Sr., a truck driver. Spencer&#x27;s father was of Irish and Czech descent, while his mother was of Ukrainian and Rusyn ancestry. Spencer’s parents were disappointed when he chose to become an actor. With his enrollment at the Professional Children&#x27;s School in Manhattan in 1963, Spencer found himself sharing classes with such fellow students as Liza Minnelli and violinist Pinchas Zukerman. He attended Fairleigh Dickinson University, but did not complete a degree. Spencer often referred to himself as a &quot;dyed-in-the-wool liberal&quot; and described Franklin Delano Roosevelt as one of his heroes.

==Career==
Spencer began his television career on &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, and eventually began appearing in supporting roles in feature films beginning with 1983&#x27;s &quot;WarGames&quot;. He won an Obie Award for the 1981 off Broadway production of &quot;Still Life&quot;, about a Vietnam War veteran, and received a Drama Desk nomination for &quot;The Day Room&quot;. In 1986 he appeared on Broadway as Dan White, the killer of Harvey Milk, in &quot;Execution of Justice&quot;, alongside Stanley Tucci and Wesley Snipes. Spencer was a supporting actor in the hit 1990 courtroom thriller &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;, portraying a tough veteran homicide detective, starring opposite Harrison Ford. Spencer&#x27;s work also extended to video games, portraying the role of Captain Hugh Paulsen in the 1995 video game &quot;Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom&quot;. Spencer&#x27;s subsequent film and television work primarily consisted of supporting roles such as a colleague and friend to Billy Crystal&#x27;s basketball referee in &quot;Forget Paris&quot; and a prickly FBI Director in Michael Bay&#x27;s film &quot;The Rock&quot;.

===&quot;L.A. Law&quot;===
In 1990 Spencer joined the cast of the television series &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, playing street-wise attorney Tommy Mullaney from 1990 to 1994. Spencer originally was not going to take the role but after reading five pages of the script he was convinced and said &quot;it was one of the best scripts I&#x27;d read&quot;. Spencer said the character&#x27;s disheveled wardrobe was based on his own. Spencer said he and co-star Cecil Hoffman spent time in New York City to prepare for the role.

===&quot;The West Wing&quot;===
In 1999, Spencer was cast as Leo McGarry on the NBC political drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. McGarry was White House Chief of Staff to the fictional U.S. President Jed Bartlet throughout the series&#x27; run. He was a recovering alcoholic, a compulsive worker, and a former U.S. Air Force pilot during the Vietnam War. McGarry would later be chosen as Matt Santos&#x27;s running mate in the show&#x27;s seventh and final season. Spencer&#x27;s role on the show earned him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2002, for the show&#x27;s third season episodes &quot;Bartlet for America&quot; and &quot;We Killed Yamamoto.&quot;

==Personal life==
Spencer was married once and was divorced in the 1970s; he had no children.

Spencer quit drinking in 1989 after over 20 years of addiction to alcohol. He was extremely close with his &quot;West Wing&quot; co-star Martin Sheen.

==Death==
Spencer died of a heart attack in a Los Angeles hospital on December 16, 2005. Many of Spencer&#x27;s &quot;West Wing&quot; co-stars paid tribute to him at his funeral, including Martin Sheen, Dulé Hill, Joshua Malina, Janel Moloney, Richard Schiff, Alan Alda, Jimmy Smits, Aaron Sorkin, Allison Janney, James Mangold, David E. Kelley, and Bradley Whitford. Kristin Chenoweth sang the musical number &quot;For Good&quot; from the Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; musical &quot;Wicked&quot;. Spencer&#x27;s remains were interred at Laurel Grove Memorial Park in his hometown of Totowa, New Jersey. 

At the time of his death, Spencer had filmed two episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot;’s seventh and final season that were in post-production – &quot;Running Mates&quot; and &quot;The Cold&quot; (Episodes 10 and 13, respectively). In both episodes, McGarry was portrayed as a candidate for vice president. The show&#x27;s writers decided to adapt Spencer&#x27;s absence by saying that McGarry died of a heart attack on election night. McGarry had already suffered a near-fatal heart attack in the show&#x27;s sixth season. Spencer&#x27;s name remained in the show&#x27;s opening credits of each remaining episode aired in the months after his death.

<doc id="1147302" wikidata="Q5414035" url="?curid=1147302" title="Lake Tekapo (town)">
<text>Lake Tekapo (often known simply as Tekapo () to avoid confusion with the lake itself) is a small township located at the southern end of the lake of the same name in the inland South Island of New Zealand. It had 558 residents according to the 2018 census, being one of five settlements in the sparsely populated Mackenzie Basin.

State Highway 8 runs directly through the township – from Christchurch and from Queenstown. Daily shuttle services link Lake Tekapo to Christchurch and Queenstown. The lake is a popular tourist destination, and several resort hotels are located at the township. Lake Tekapo Airport is located west of the town where local tourism operator Air Safaris is based. Twizel lies 60 km (39 minutes drive) south of Lake Tekapo via Lake Pukaki and Burkes Pass lies 21 km (15 minutes drive) west along State Highway 8.

==History==
The Māori were the first people to discover the Mackenzie Basin. The name Tekapo, a misspelling of Takapō, derived from the te reo Māori words &quot;taka&quot; (sleeping mat) and &quot;pō&quot; (night). Takapō means &quot;To leave in haste at night&quot;. 

The Mackenzie Basin became known to Europeans in 1855 when, in order to find a less conspicuous route, James Mackenzie, a Scottish sheep thief, ventured inland and discovered the high country that now bears his name. In 1857, John and Barbara Hay established the first sheep farm in Mackenzie on the shore of Lake Tekapo.

Lake Tekapo township started to grow after the construction of hydropower stations in the 1940s. Prior to this, the town consisted of &quot;two station homesteads, a private hotel, and several holiday cottages&quot;. The project was delayed due to World War II, but it was eventually completed and commissioned in 1951. The control gates built across the outlet of Lake Tekapo regulate the amount of water entering the Tekapo River. These were completed in 1940. State Highway 8 runs across the top of them.

After the completion of the hydroelectric scheme, the town of Lake Tekapo returned to being a small town. Visitor numbers increased in the 1960s with skiers and ice skaters visiting in winter months.
The population declined in the 1980s to a total of 189 residents in 1991. The population increased in the 1990s with the population reaching 294 residents in 1996. 

Tekapo is expected to grow significantly between 2020 and 2050. The MacKenzie District Council expects the district’s population will jump from 4950 to 9050, dwellings 3872 to 6120, jobs 1876 to 4618, and peak day visitors 17,378 to 61,253.

The MacKenzie District Council announced in 2021 that it will start using the dual names of Tekapo and Takapō when referring to Lake Tekapo (Tekapo is an incorrect spelling of Takapō, the Māori name for Lake Tekapo).

== Attractions ==
=== International Dark-Sky Reserve ===

In June 2012, an area of 430,000 hectares (1,100,000 acres) around Tekapo was declared the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association. At the time of the designation in 2012, the reserve was the largest in the world, and the only reserve of its type in the Southern Hemisphere.

====Mount John University Observatory====

Selected for its very clear atmosphere, large number of clear sky nights, and relative freedom from light pollution, Mount John University Observatory is located on a small hill to the north of the town, and south of the small Lake Alexandrina. Originally set up by the University of Pennsylvania (looking for a southern hemisphere location), it is now operated by the University of Canterbury. 

From 1969 to 1983, the United States Air Force had a satellite tracking station adjacent to the observatory.

==== Star gazing tours ====
The Dark-Sky Project runs star gazing tours from their award winning observatory building on the foreshore of Lake Tekapo. The Dark Sky Project is jointly owned by founders Hide Ozawa and Graeme Murray, and Ngāi Tahu iwi. In the New Zealand Tourism Awards 2021, Dark-Sky Project won the Māori Tourism award, He Kai Kei Aku Ringa.

The observatory building contains a restored Brashear telescope. It is built of brass, iron, steel and wood and stands nine metres high. It has an 18-inch refracting lens. The Brashear telescope was built in 1894. This telescope was brought to New Zealand in 1963 by the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Canterbury. 

=== Church of the Good Shepherd ===

The Church of the Good Shepherd is situated within the township on the shores of Lake Tekapo. It was built in 1935, and was the first church in the Mackenzie Basin. The church was designed by Christchurch architect R.S.D. Harman, based on sketches by a local artist, Esther Hope. The building is a Category 1 listed historic place and is one of the most photographed churches in New Zealand. It features an altar window that frames views of the lake and mountains.

=== Sheepdog statue ===

Close to the Church of the Good Shepherd is a well-known bronze statue of a New Zealand Collie sheepdog. The statue was commissioned by Mackenzie Country residents in recognition of the indispensable role of the sheepdog in their livelihoods. The sculptor was Innes Elliott of Kaikōura, with a dog called Haig, belonging to a neighbour, being the model. Elliott reported the sculpting process took approximately fifteen months. Clay for the model came from the insulator works in Temuka, with a plaster cast of it made and sent to London in 1966, where the statue was cast.

=== Tekapo Hot Springs ===
Tekapo Hot Springs is a tourist attraction located to the north-west of the township, at the base of Mount John. It has three hot pools designed for soaking in, which range in temperature from 36.5 to 38.5 degrees Celsius. These are designed in the shape of Lake Ōhau, Lake Pukaki and Lake Tekapo. A further two cooler pools are designed for children and a splash pad is also present. Tekapo Hot Springs also has an ice skating rink and a snow tubing park.

=== Lake Tekapo foot bridge ===

The 125-metre bridge was opened in 2015. This crosses the Tekapo River and connects the Church of the Good Shepherd with the rest of the Lake Tekapo township.

===Lake Tekapo Regional Park===

Lake Tekapo Regional Park is a recreation area of located to the east of the township. The park includes picnic areas, an enclosed dog exercise park and of cycling and walking tracks. Access to the park is by foot or bicycle from the Lake Tekapo township or by car from Lilybank Road.

=== Skiing ===

The Roundhill Ski Area is located on the Two Thumb Range overlooking Lake Tekapo. It is approximately from Lake Tekapo Village. Roundhill&#x27;s base is at 1350 metres above sea level and the highest point the lifts rise to is above sea level. It comprises of terrain.

==Military base==
The New Zealand Army has a small training base located to the west of the Tekapo township. It is used for general military exercises and was used for pre-deployment training of forces being sent to Afghanistan. 

In 1968, a major fire at the military base during winter led to several buildings being burnt to the ground.

The base encompasses approximately of terrain which sits approximately above sea level. It continues to be an important training site for the New Zealand Army for initial field training and battle handling exercises.

In 2016, the New Zealand Government announced that $16 million was going to be spent upgrading the military base. Improvements would include accommodation upgrades, communications, security fencing, extensions to heavy and light vehicle tracks and a new main camp gate.

An unformed road that runs alongside the Tekapo Military base was sold by the Mackenzie District Council to the New Zealand Defence Force in 2021 for $1 in order to address safety concerns of the public getting too close to military training activities such as live firing of weapons.

== Government ==

Tekapo is part of the Waitaki electorate. The MacKenzie District Council is responsible for providing local government services to Lake Tekapo.

== Education ==
Lake Tekapo School is a contributing primary school serving years 1 to 6, with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1940.

<text>Puce is a brownish purple color. The term comes from the French , literally meaning &quot;flea color&quot;.

Puce became popular in the late 18th century in France. It appeared in clothing at the court of Louis XVI, and was said to be a favorite color of Marie Antoinette, though there are no portraits of her wearing it.

Puce was also a popular fashion color in 19th-century Paris. In his novel , Émile Zola describes a woman &quot;dressed in a dark gown of an equivocal color, somewhere between puce and goose shit.&quot; In Victor Hugo&#x27;s , Mademoiselle Baptistine wears &quot;a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since.&quot;

==Variations of puce==

===Puce (ISCC-NBS)===

The color to the right is the color called puce in the ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names (1955). Since this color has a hue code of 353, it is a slightly purplish red.

===Puce (Maerz and Paul)===
The color box to the right shows the color called &quot;puce&quot; in the 1930 book by Maerz and Paul, &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot;; the color &quot;puce&quot; is displayed on page 37, Plate 7, Color Sample H4.
===Puce (Pourpre color list)===

At right is the color called &quot;puce&quot; in the Pourpre.com color list, a color list widely popular in France.
This is the original &quot;puce&quot;, from which all other tones of puce ultimately derive.

<doc id="1147313" wikidata="Q5601848" url="?curid=1147313" title="Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Toxteth">
<text>The Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas is a Grade II Listed building in Toxteth, Liverpool, situated at the junction of Berkley Street and Princes Road. Built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style, it was completed in 1870. The architects were W. &amp; J. Hay and the church was built by Henry Sumners. It is an enlarged version of St Theodore&#x27;s church in Constantinople (now converted into the Vefa Kilise Mosque).

St. Nicholas&#x27; was built in the Liverpool neighbourhood of Toxteth in a period when Liverpool&#x27;s magnates were filling Toxteth with opulent mansions. The church stands in a neighbourhood of substantial homes and in a cluster of houses of worship designed to advertise the wealth and status of a group of captains of industry that was remarkably ethnically diverse, by the standards of Victorian England. Immediately adjacent to St. Nicholas are the Princes Road Synagogue and an early French gothic, Welsh Presbyterian Church.

The exterior is extremely ornate, featuring arches within arches, done in alternating bands of white stone and red brick. There is a row of three domes on the portico, and a fourth dome over the nave, all raised on drums. The interior, with white marble columns and Byzantine capitals, is surprisingly plain compared with the exterior.

<doc id="1147318" wikidata="Q562475" url="?curid=1147318" title="Yakovlev Yak-9">
<text>The Yakovlev Yak-9 (; NATO reporting name: Frank) is a single-engine, single-seat multipurpose fighter aircraft used by the Soviet Union and its allies during World War II and the early Cold War. It was a development of the robust and successful Yak-7B fighter, which was based in turn on the tandem-seat advanced trainer known as the Yak-7UTI. The Yak-9 started arriving in Soviet fighter regiments in late 1942 and played a major role in retaking air superiority from the Luftwaffe&#x27;s new Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and fighters during the grand Battle of Kursk in summer 1943.

The Yak-9 had a cut down rear fuselage with an unobscured canopy. Its lighter metal structure allowed for an increased fuel load and armament over previous models built from wood. The Yak-9 was manoeuvrable at high speeds when flying at low and medium altitudes and was also easy to control, qualities that allowed it to be one of the most produced Soviet fighters of World War II. It was produced in different variants including the Yak-9T with the cannon and the &quot;large-calibre&quot; Yak-9K with a cannon firing through the propeller hub, which were used for antitank duty and as potent aircraft destroyers, the fighter-bomber Yak-9B with an internal bomb bay behind the cockpit for up to worth of bombs, the long-range Yak-9D and the Yak-9DD with additional wing fuel tanks to escort bombers over Eastern Europe, and the Yak-9U with a more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics. The Yak-9 remained in production from 1942 to 1948, with 16,769 built (14,579 during the war).

After World War II, the Yak-9 also was used by the North Korean Air Force during the Korean War.

==Design and development==
The Yak-9 represented further development of the successful Yakovlev Yak-7 fighter, a production version of the lightened Yak-7DI, taking full advantage of the combat experience with its predecessor. Greater availability of duralumin allowed for lighter construction which in turn permitted a number of modifications to the basic design. Yak-9 variants used two different wings, five different engines, six different fuel tank configurations and seven different armament setups.

=== Yak-9U ===
During December 1943, the new airframe (Yak-9U) was able to use the M-107A engine, which was more powerful than the previous VK-105PF. The engine installation was new and included individual faired exhaust pipes. The oil cooler intake was moved from beneath the nose to the port wing root as well as an enlarged radiator bath being moved further aft under the fuselage. The supercharger intake was centered on the top decking of the engine cowling. The rear antenna cable was moved inside a lengthened rear canopy which provided the pilot with a better view to the rear, while the rear fuselage was cut down and the horizontal tail surfaces were slightly reduced in size. The wings and fuselage structure were made of metal which was then skinned with Bakelite. The Yak-9U was typically armed with a ShVAK cannon firing through the hollow propeller shaft, and two Berezin UB machine guns.

State trials were carried out from January to April 1944 and revealed that the Yak-9U had a better top speed compared to fighters in service on the Eastern front at . Unlike the I-185 the Yak-9U was stable and easy to fly. However, the M-107A engine inherited the problems of the VK-105PF and was prone to overheating, oil leaks, loss of engine pressure during climbs, spark plugs constantly burning out, and intense vibrations which would fatigue assembly bolts leading to a short engine life. These defects forced the first production batches starting during April 1944  to be powered by the more reliable M-105 PF-3 engine. Further changes were made, like increasing the fuel capacity to and in order to re-balance the aircraft, the wings were moved forward and the aircraft&#x27;s VIsh-107LO propeller being replaced with the older VIsh-105S. A total production of 1,134 aircraft were constructed by December 1944.

==Operational history==

===Second World War===

The first Yak-9 entered service in October 1942 and saw combat the same year. The Yak-9 operated with a wide variety of armament for use in anti-tank, light bomber and long-range escort roles. At low altitude, in which it operated predominantly, the Yak-9 was more maneuverable than the Bf 109. A series of improvements in performance and armament did not degrade the handling characteristics. Soviet pilots regarded the Yak-9&#x27;s performance as being comparable to the Bf 109G and Fw 190A-3/A-4.
However, at the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union Yak-9&#x27;s performed poorly against the Luftwaffe because of a lack of training, although by the Battle of Stalingrad they began to perform better. After the Battle of Smolensk, in the second half of 1943, the famed Free French Normandie-Niémen unit became a &quot;Groupe&quot; and was equipped with the Yak-9.

The first unit to use the Yak-9U, between 25 October and 25 December 1944, was 163.IAP. Pilots were ordered not to use the engine at combat speed since this reduced its life to two or three flights only. Nevertheless, in the course of 398 sorties, the unit claimed 27 Focke-Wulf Fw 190As and one Bf 109G-2, for the loss of two Yaks in dogfights, one to flak and four in accidents. The Yak-9U contributed greatly toward the Soviets gaining air superiority, and the Germans learned to avoid the Yaks “without antenna mast”.

A large formation of the Yak-9DD version was transferred to Bari (the capital of Apulia, in Italy) to help Yugoslav partisans in the Balkans.

One of the top-scoring Yak-9 pilots was First Lieutenant A.I. Vybornov. Flying a type-T (equipped with a 37mm NS-37 cannon in the nose) he achieved 19 air victories, plus nine shared and was awarded the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of the Soviet Union in June 1945. At the end of the war, on 22 March 1945, Lieutenant L.I. Sivko from 812th IAP achieved an air victory against a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, but he was killed soon afterward by another Me 262, probably piloted by Franz Schall, a top-scoring Me 262 pilot.

Fighter units with this aircraft suffered lower losses than average. Of 2,550 Yak-9s manufactured up the end of 1943, only 383 were lost in combat.

===Post-war era===
At the beginning of the Cold War, Yak-9 fighters began buzzing American, British, and French flights in the air corridors to West Berlin. During the Berlin Blockade, Yak-9 fighters interfered with the U.S. Air Force-Royal Air Force airlift. During 1949, the Soviet Union provided surplus Yak-9P (VK-107) aircraft to some satellite states in the Soviet bloc to help them rebuild their air forces following the West Berlin blockade. A section of the aircraft&#x27;s operating manual was accidentally omitted from the translation from Russian into some languages: before starting the Yak-9, it was necessary to hand-crank a small cockpit-mounted oil pump 25 times to provide initial lubrication to the Klimov V12 engine, unlike World War II German and Western fighters equipped with forced closed-cycle lubrication systems. Skipping this unusual but vital step resulted in frequent engine seizures during the takeoff roll and initial climb, causing several fatalities during 1950.

==Variants==

Yakovlev OKB created 22 modifications of the Yak-9, of which 15 saw mass production. The most notable of these include:
;Yak-9
The first production version, with a Klimov M-105PF engine with , 1 × ShVAK cannon with 120 rounds, and 1 × UBS machine gun with 200 rounds.
;Yak-9 (M-106)
A prototype with the Klimov M-106-1SK engine with . It did not advance to production because of problems with the engine.
;Yak-9T
A Yak-9 armed with a Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 cannon with 30 rounds instead of the ShVAK. The cockpit was moved back to compensate for the heavier nose. A problem corrected during prototype tests was poor quality control that led to multiple oil and coolant leaks from cannon recoil. Recoil and a limited supply of ammunition required accurate aiming and two- or three-round bursts. The Yak-9T was widely used against enemy shipping on the Black Sea and against tanks the cannon could penetrate up to armor from but was also successful against aircraft: a single cannon hit was usually sufficient to tear apart the target. Virage (constant altitude and speed turn) time was 18–19 seconds. 2748 were produced.

;Yak-9K
A Yak-9T modified with a NS-45 cannon with 29 rounds and a distinctive muzzle brake to deal with the massive recoil. Firing the cannon at speeds below caused a dramatic loss of control and tossed the pilot back and forth in the cockpit; however, accurate shooting was possible at higher speeds and in two- to three-round bursts. The recoil also caused numerous oil and coolant leaks. The heavy cannon decreased performance dramatically, especially at high altitudes, to the point that Yak-9Ks were relegated to heavy fighter duty and had to be escorted by Yak-3s. The Yak-9K saw only limited use due to the unreliability of the NS-45 and to airframe performance issues caused by the NS-45 and by the larger fuel tanks used on the Yak-9K; it also saw little use because of a reduced number of German bombers.

;Yak-9D
A long-range version of the Yak-9 with fuel capacity increased from , giving a maximum range of . Its combat usefulness at full range was limited by a lack of radio navigation equipment, and a number of aircraft were used as short-range fighters with fuel carried only in inner wing tanks. The time to complete a circle was 19–20 seconds. The weight of fire was .
;Yak-9TD
A Yak-9D with an NS-37 cannon and provision for 4 × FAB-50 bombs under the wings.
;Yak-9B
A fighter-bomber version of the Yak-9D (factory designation Yak-9L) with four vertical tube bomb bays aft of the cockpit with capacity for up to 4 × FAB-100 bombs or 4 PTAB cassettes with 32 × bomblets each, although normally only of weapons were carried in the front bomb bays. Poor handling with a full bomb and fuel load and lack of special aiming equipment limited its combat usefulness.
;Yak-9DD
A Yak-9D or Yak-9T modified for longer range by a larger fuel capacity of which increased the maximum range to . Radio navigation equipment for night and poor weather flying was added. The Yak-9DD was used primarily to escort Petlyakov Pe-2 and Tupolev Tu-2 bombers although it proved less than ideal for this role due to an insufficient speed advantage over the bombers. In 1944, several Yak-9DD fighters were used to escort B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bombers attacking targets in Romania using the Ukraine-Romania-Italy routes.
;Yak-9M
A Yak-9D with the cockpit moved to the rear like the Yak-9T, as well as numerous fixes and improvements based on experience with previous versions.
;Yak-9M PVO
A Yak-9M with slightly reduced fuel capacity, the Klimov VK-105PF2 engine with , and radio and navigational equipment for night and adverse weather flying for PVO Strany.

;Yak-9 MPVO
A single-seat night fighter aircraft, equipped with a searchlight and an RPK-10 radio compass.
;Yak-9S
A Yak-9M with a Klimov VK-105PF engine, a new propeller, and armament consisting of 1 × Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 cannon with 60 rounds, and 2 × Berezin B-20 cannons with 120 rounds. It did not enter production due to its poor performance compared to the Yak-3 and Yak-9U.
;Yak-9R
A single-seat tactical reconnaissance aircraft.
;Yak-9P

This aircraft was the last and the most advanced version of the Yak-9 fighter, which became the pinnacle of development among A. S. Yakovlev&#x27;s piston-engined fighters. The Yak-9P (Product P) that appeared in 1946 was a modification of the Yak-9U fighter of composite construction. Unlike its predecessor, it had all-metal wings with elliptical tips. By this time, the manufacture of high-strength aluminum alloys was established in the Soviet Union, simplifying aircraft operation and increasing aircraft service life.
;Yak-9P (VK-107)
A Yak-9U with an all-metal wing. &quot;Yak-9P&quot; in this case was a factory designation different from the Yak-9P with two ShVAKs described above.
;Yak-9PD
A high-altitude interceptor (unrelated to the two other Yak-9P variants described above) with the Klimov M-105PD engine, designed specifically to intercept Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 86P high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft overflying Moscow in 1942–1943. Poor performance due to the unreliable engine dramatically improved with adoption of the Klimov M-106PV with water injection, with the aircraft reaching during testing. The armament was reduced to the ShVAK cannon only to save weight.
;Yak-9U (VK-105)
A Yak-9T with the Klimov VK-105PF2 engine and numerous aerodynamic and structural improvements introduced with the Yak-3. The main visual difference from the Yak-9T was in the oil coolers in the wing roots, like on the Yak-3, and in that plywood covered the fuselage, instead of fabric. It differed visually from the Yak-3 only by the main landing gear covers. The armament increased to 1 × VYa cannon with 60 rounds and 2 × UBSs with 170 rounds each. The VYa cannon could be replaced by a ShVAK, B-20, or NS-37, the latter requiring removal of the starboard UBS machine gun. It did not enter production because the VYa was considered unsatisfactory and because the one cannon, one machine gun armament seen on previous models offered a significant increase in range.
;Yak-9U (VK-107)
The definitive Yak-9 variant, the Yak-9U (VK-105) was equipped with the new Klimov VK-107A engine, and with the ShVAK with 120 rounds replacing the VYa cannon. The weight of fire was . Early test flights in 1943 indicated that the only comparable Soviet fighter was the Polikarpov I-185 prototype which was more difficult to fly and less agile due to higher weight. The prototype&#x27;s top speed of at was faster than any other production fighter aircraft in the world at the time, other than the P-51B that could reach up to on military power. Early problems with overheating were fixed by enlarging the radiators and production aircraft had further improved aerodynamics. The time to complete a circle was 23 seconds. It was the best Soviet fighter at high altitude.
;Yak-9UV
A two-seat trainer version of the Yak-9U (VK-107) with armament reduced to a single Berezin B-20 cannon with 100 rounds. It did not enter production due to the introduction of jet aircraft.
;Yak-9UT
A Yak-9U (VK-107) armed with 1 × Nudelman N-37 cannon with 30 rounds and 2 x Berezin B-20 cannons with 120 rounds each, giving a total one-second burst mass of . Similarly to the Yak-9TK, it could be converted to replace the N-37 with a B-20, NS-23, or N-45. Production aircraft carried the NS-23 instead of the N-37 cannon as the default armament.
;Yak-9-57
The Yak-9-57 was a one-off conversion of a Yak-9UT armed with a 57 mm cannon. The large caliber cannon did not protrude from the spinner cone like the Yak-9-37/45 models.
;Yak-9V
A two-seat trainer version of Yak-9M and Yak-9T with the Klimov VK-105PF2 engine and with armament reduced to 1 × ShVAK with 90 rounds.

;Modern replicas
In the early 1990s, Yakovlev started limited production for the warbird market of Yak-9 and Yak-3 replica aircraft using original World War II equipment and Allison V-1710 engines. These modern-built replicas using the Allison engines have counterclockwise-rotation props, unlike the originals, which strictly used clockwise-rotation Soviet V12 powerplants.

<text>Pampers is an American brand for babies and toddlers products marketed by Procter &amp; Gamble. This includes diapers, wipes etc.

== History ==
In 1961, P&amp;G researcher Victor Mills disliked changing the cloth diapers of his newborn grandchild. He assigned fellow researchers in P&amp;G&#x27;s Exploratory Division in Miami Valley, Ohio to look into making a better disposable diaper. They were created by researchers at P&amp;G including Vic Mills and Norma Lueders Baker. The name &quot;Pampers&quot; was coined by Alfred Goldman, Creative Director at Benton &amp; Bowles.

In 1982, P&amp;G developed elasticized single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas to aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which had not been absorbed. In fact, the first patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper was in 1973 by P&amp;G. In 1982, Pampers introduced an elasticized wingfold diaper with elastic leg gathers and refastenable tapes which was a cross between the early 1960s design and the modern hourglass shape, a feature that was first introduced on Luvs in 1976 and evolved into an industry standard in 1985.

In 1986, thin diapers made with absorbent gelling material were released. This made the average weight of a typical medium size diaper decrease by 50%.

In 1987, Pampers and Huggies both introduced frontal tape systems which allow repositioning of the lateral tape without tearing the diaper.

In the 1990s Pampers introduced a thinner diaper known as Ultra Dry Thins. The early 1990s also saw the introduction of gender-specific diapers in the Pampers brand; the product returned to unisex diapers towards the end of the decade.

In 1993, Pampers introduced training underwear, but the Pampers Trainers were a short lived product. Pampers did not sell training underwear again until the introduction of Easy Ups.

In 1996, P&amp;G acquired Baby Fresh wipes from Kimberly-Clark; Kimberly-Clark had recently acquired Baby Fresh owner Scott Paper Company and was ordered to sell the wipes business.

In 1998, Procter &amp; Gamble introduced its largest diaper at the time, Pampers Baby-Dry Size 6. It was promoted in an advertising campaign featuring pediatrician and child development expert Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, who said to let the child decide when the time is right to potty train. The size 6 diapers were billed for growing toddlers. Huggies also introduced a size 6 diaper at this time.

In 2018 the company launched its newest diaper line called Pampers Pure which was designed without chlorine bleaching, fragrance, lotion, parabens, natural rubber latex and 26 allergens identified by the European Union. The wipes launched with the new collection contain 99% water and premium cotton. Pampers announced that the goal was to give parents an option for an affordable natural diaper brand.

==Feedback ==
In March 2010, Pampers announced a change to their popular Cruisers and Swaddlers diapers (Active Fit and New Baby respectively in Europe) with the addition of the new Dry-Max technology. Many parents reported rashes and chemical burns as a result of using the new diapers. Procter &amp; Gamble claim that pediatric experts have reviewed the Pampers with DryMax safety data and have seen no correlation between the reported rash and diaper. In May 2010, a lawsuit was filed against Procter &amp; Gamble based on the injuries allegedly caused by the diapers. In September 2010, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission issued the results of its investigation into the matter, finding no evidence that these diapers cause diaper rash. In the UK the case was brought to people&#x27;s attention on consumer rights programme Watchdog in May 2010.

== Advertising ==
Pampers is marketed in various ways, such as print ads and television commercials. Print ads often appear in magazines and other periodicals. Television commercials appear during soap operas co-produced by Procter and Gamble, such as &quot;Bold and the Beautiful&quot; &amp; &quot;Young and the Restless&quot;, and during the airing of parenting shows. Another way Pampers is promoted is through product placement. Pampers paid $50,000 to be featured in the film &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;. P&amp;G has also sponsored the program &quot;Make Room for Baby&quot; on the Discovery Health Channel.

P&amp;G contributes to flood relief efforts in Pakistan in part through its Pampers brand and &quot;Spread a Smile&quot; campaign, which provides free health check-ups, medicines, and oral rehydration therapy to babies and children living in the flood affected areas.

In Romania, Pampers is a sponsor for top tennis player Simona Halep and in Poland, Pampers has a partnership with Eurovision 2024 star Luna.

<text>Lord David Paul Nicholas Dundas (born 2 June 1945) is an English musician and actor, best known for his chart success in the pop genre during the 1970s as well as his later career in film and television scores.

==Biography==
Dundas was born in Oxford, the second son of Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Marquess of Zetland, and his wife Penelope Pike. As a younger son of a marquess, he is entitled to the courtesy title &#x27;Lord&#x27;. He was educated at Harrow and the Central School of Speech and Drama. While at the Central School, Dundas shared a Camden Town house with actor Vivian MacKerrell and film director Bruce Robinson. The house on Albert Street had been bought by his parents for him to live in, eventually according to Dundas himself &quot;15 people were living there – there were three bedrooms&quot;. Those years served as the basis for Robinson&#x27;s unpublished memoir and the film &quot;Withnail &amp; I&quot; (1987). Dundas co-wrote the score for the film, considered &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s biggest cult films&quot;.

On 17 December 1971, Dundas married Corinna Maeve Wolfe Scott, and they had two children. They divorced in 1995. Dundas then married Taina Bettina Breuckmann on 21 November 1997, and they had one son.

==Musical career==
His 1976 single &quot;Jeans On&quot; reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and No. 1 in the German Singles Chart, where the song remained 19 weeks in the Top Ten. The song originally appeared as a television advertising jingle for Brutus Jeans (the words used in the jingle – &quot;I pull my Brutus jeans on&quot; – were replaced with &quot;I pull my old blue jeans on&quot; for the single release). The single was later sampled by Fatboy Slim for his track &quot;Sho Nuff&quot; which was also used in an advertisement in 2006 for the SEAT Ibiza. Dundas&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Another Funny Honeymoon&quot; was a medium-sized hit, reaching No. 29 in the UK. Dundas performed the song live on the BBC Television show, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, in 1977. A later single, &quot;Where Were You Today&quot;, based on a C&amp;A radio commercial (&quot;Come and C and A&quot; being replaced by the song title) was less successful.
Jingles made by Dundas for Capital Radio were played daily on the station in the 1970s: &quot;Grab a little piece of heaven, with Roger Scott from 3 to 7&quot; and &quot;Get a little soft rock, country, blues, with Tony Myatt from 11 to 2&quot;.

<doc id="1147329" wikidata="Q2617260" url="?curid=1147329" title="Goji">
<text>Goji, goji berry, or wolfberry () is the sweet fruit of either &quot;Lycium barbarum&quot; or &quot;Lycium chinense&quot;, two closely related species of boxthorn in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. &quot;L. barbarum&quot; and &quot;L. chinense&quot; fruits are similar but can be distinguished by differences in taste and sugar content.

Goji berries are primarily cultivated in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Xinjiang in China, where the unique climate and soil conditions contribute to their vibrant color and nutrient-rich profile.

Both of these species are native to East Asia, and have been long used in traditional East Asian cuisine. In the United States, varieties of the genus, &quot;Lycium&quot;, are given the common names, &quot;desert-thorn&quot; and &quot;Berlandier&#x27;s wolfberry&quot; for the species, &quot;Lycium berlandieri&quot;.

The fruit has also been an ingredient in East Asian traditional medicine, namely traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean medicine since at least the 3rd century AD. In pharmacopeias, the fruit of the plant is called by the Latin name &quot;lycii fructus&quot; and the leaves are called &quot;herba lycii&quot;.

Since about 2000, goji berry and derived products have become common in developed countries as health foods or alternative medicine remedies, extending from exaggerated and unproven claims about their health benefits.

== Etymology and naming==
The genus name &quot;Lycium&quot; was assigned by Linnaeus in 1753. The Latin name &quot;lycium&quot; is derived from the Greek word λυκιον (&quot;lykion&quot;), used by Pliny the Elder (23–79) and Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. 40–90) for a plant known as dyer&#x27;s buckthorn, which was probably a &quot;Rhamnus&quot; species. The Greek word refers to the ancient region of Lycia (Λυκία) in Anatolia, where that plant grew.

The common English name, &quot;wolfberry&quot;, has an unknown origin. It may have arisen from the mistaken assumption that the Latin name &quot;Lycium&quot; was derived from Greek λύκος (&quot;lycos&quot;), meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.

In the English-speaking world, the name &quot;goji berry&quot; has been used since around 2000. The word &quot;goji&quot; is an approximation of the pronunciation of &quot;gǒuqǐ&quot; (pinyin for ), the name for the berry-producing plant &quot;L. chinense&quot; in several Chinese dialects. In Japanese, it is known as 枸杞 (&quot;kuko&quot;), usually written in kana as クコ.

In technical botanical nomenclature, &quot;L. barbarum&quot; is called matrimony vine, while &quot;L. chinense&quot; is Chinese desert-thorn. In the United States, various common names are used for &quot;Lycium&quot; species and varieties, such as desert-thorn, boxthorn, matrimony vine, and wolfberry.

== Uses ==
===Traditional East Asian cuisine===
Young wolfberry shoots and leaves are harvested commercially as a leaf vegetable. The berries are used in dishes as either a garnish or a source of sweetness.

===Food===

Since the early 21st century, the dried fruit, occasionally compared to raisins, has been marketed as a health food, with unsupported health claims about its benefits. In the wake of those claims, dried and fresh goji berries were included in many snack foods and food supplements, such as granola bars. There are products of whole and ground wolfberry seeds and seed oil.

==Marketing controversies==

Exaggerated claims about the health benefits of goji berry and derived products have triggered strong reactions from government regulatory agencies. In 2019–2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed two Goji product distributors on notice with warning letters about unproven therapeutic benefits. The advertisers&#x27; statements were in violation of the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act [21 USC/321 (g)(1)] because they &quot;establish[ed] the product as a drug intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease&quot; when goji ingredients have had no such scientific evaluation. Additionally stated by the FDA, the goji products are &quot;not generally recognized as safe and effective for the referenced conditions&quot; and therefore must be treated as a &quot;new drug&quot; under Section 21(p) of the Act. New drugs may not be legally marketed in the United States without prior approval of the FDA.

In January 2007, marketing statements for a goji juice product were the subject of an investigative report by consumer advocacy program &quot;Marketplace&quot; produced by Canadian public broadcaster CBC. In the interview, Earl Mindell (then working for direct-marketing company &quot;FreeLife International, Inc.&quot;) falsely claimed the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York had completed clinical studies showing that use of wolfberry juice would prevent 75% of human breast cancer cases.

Among the extreme claims used to market goji berries or its juice, often referred to as a &quot;superfruit&quot;, is the unsupported story that a Chinese man named Li Qing Yuen, who was said to have consumed wolfberries daily, lived to the age of 256 years (1677–1933). This claim originated in a 2003 booklet by Earl Mindell, who also claimed goji had anti-cancer properties. The booklet contained false and unverified claims.

On 29 May 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against FreeLife in the United States District Court of Arizona. This lawsuit alleged false claims, misrepresentations, false and deceptive advertising, and other issues regarding FreeLife&#x27;s Himalayan Goji Juice, GoChi, and TaiSlim products. This lawsuit sought remedies for consumers who had purchased the products over the years. A settlement agreement was reached on 28 April 2010, where FreeLife took steps to ensure that its goji products were not marketed as &quot;unheated&quot; or &quot;raw&quot;, and made a contribution to an educational organization.

As with many other novel &quot;health&quot; foods and supplements, the lack of clinical evidence and poor quality control in the manufacture of consumer products prevent goji from being clinically recommended or applied.

==Scientific research==
Because of the numerous effects claimed by traditional medicine, there has been considerable basic research to investigate the biological properties of the fruit phytochemicals. The composition of the fruits, seeds, roots, and other constituents, such as polysaccharides, has been analyzed, and extracts are under study. However, no biological effects or clinical effectiveness of consuming the fruit itself, its juice, or extracts have been confirmed, .

==Safety==

===Interaction with drugs===
In vitro testing suggests that unidentified wolfberry phytochemicals in goji tea may inhibit metabolism of medications, such as those processed by the cytochrome P450 liver enzymes. Such drugs include warfarin and drugs for diabetes, tachycardia or hypertension.

===Pesticide and fungicide residues===
Organochlorine pesticides are conventionally used in commercial wolfberry cultivation to mitigate infestation by insects. China&#x27;s Green Food Standard, administered by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture&#x27;s China Green Food Development Center, permits some pesticide and herbicide use. Agriculture in the Tibetan plateau (where many &quot;Himalayan&quot; or &quot;Tibetan&quot;-branded berries supposedly originate) conventionally uses fertilizers and pesticides, making organic claims for berries originating there dubious.

Since the early 21st century, high levels of insecticide residues (including fenvalerate, cypermethrin, and acetamiprid) and fungicide residues (such as triadimenol and isoprothiolane), have been detected by the United States Food and Drug Administration in some imported wolfberries and wolfberry products of Chinese origin, leading to the seizure of these products.

== Cultivation and commercialization==
Wolfberries are most often sold in dried form.

When ripe, the oblong, red berries are tender and must be picked or shaken from the vine into trays to avoid spoiling. The fruits are preserved by drying them in full sun on open trays or by mechanical dehydration, employing a progressively increasing series of heat exposure over 48 hours.

=== China ===
China is the main supplier of wolfberry products globally, with total exports generating US$120 million in 2004. This production derived from farmed nationwide, yielding 95,000 tons of wolfberries.

The majority of commercially produced wolfberry (50,000 tons in 2013, accounting for 45% of China&#x27;s total yield) comes from &quot;L. barbarum&quot; plantations in the Ningxia and Xinjiang in Northwestern China. The cultivation is centered in Zhongning County, Ningxia, where wolfberry plantations typically range between 40 and 400 hectares (100–1000 acres or 500–6000 &quot;mu&quot;) in area.

Ningxia goji has been cultivated along the fertile floodplains of the Yellow River for more than 700 years. They are sometimes described commercially as &quot;red diamonds&quot;. The region has developed an industrial association of growers, processors, marketers, and scholars of wolfberry cultivation to promote the berry&#x27;s commercial and export potential. Ningxia goji is the variety used by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine.

Wolfberries are celebrated each August in Ningxia with an annual festival coinciding with the berry harvest. Originally held in Ningxia&#x27;s capital, Yinchuan, the festival has been based since 2000 in Zhongning County.

Besides Ningxia, commercial volumes of wolfberries grow in the Chinese regions of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei.

=== United Kingdom ===
&quot;Lycium barbarum&quot; had been introduced in the United Kingdom in the 1730s by The Duke of Argyll, but the plant was mostly used for hedges and decorative gardening.

The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) had initially placed goji berry in the Novel Foods list. That classification would have required authorisation from the European Council and Parliament for marketing. However, on 18 June 2007, the FSA concluded that there was a significant history of consumption of the fruit before 1997, indicating its safety, and thus removed it from the list.

=== Canada and United States ===
In the first decade of the 21st century, farmers in Canada and the United States began cultivating goji on a commercial scale to meet potential markets for fresh berries, juice, and processed products.

=== Australia ===
Australia imports most of its goji berries from China, due to how expensive the Australian labour force is in comparison with the countries that have the largest share of the current market.

<text>The Kaiapoi River is a minor river of north Canterbury, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Originally called the &quot;Cam River&quot;, it is a tributary of the Waimakariri River, which it joins at the larger river&#x27;s estuary. The river is long, and its drainage area is about .

The towns of Rangiora, Kaiapoi and Woodend are situated on the banks of the river.

The Kaiapoi River has several tributaries, including the Cam River, used for carting logs and wool in the 1890s and 1900s. There are also several streams that join the Kaiapoi River. Some hold a large population of salmon and trout—the Cam River was a fishing spot in the 1940s and still holds a large population of trout today.

In 2018, dieback of aquatic plants, shellfish and salmon in the river was attributed to high salinity of the water by Environment Canterbury. This was thought to be due to a change in the profile of the riverbed after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake allowing seawater to progress further upstream.

<text>The Atlantic Revolutions (19 April 1775 – 4 December 1838) were numerous revolutions in the Atlantic World in the late 18th and early 19th century. Following the Age of Enlightenment, ideas critical of absolutist monarchies spread. A revolutionary wave occurred, with the aim of ending monarchical rule, emphasizing the ideals of the Enlightenment, and spreading liberalism.

Other revolutions in West Africa emphasized forms of Islam that were egalitarian in comparison to traditional forms.

In 1755, early signs of governmental changes occurred with the formation of the Corsican Republic and Pontiac&#x27;s War. The largest of these early revolutions was the American Revolution beginning in 1775, which founded the United States. The American Revolution inspired other movements, including the French Revolution in 1789 and the Haitian Revolution in 1791. These revolutions were based on the equivocation of personal freedom with the right to own property — a concept spread by Edmund Burke — and on the equality of all men, an idea expressed in constitutions written as a result of these revolutions.

==History==

It took place in both the Americas and Europe, including the United States (1775–1783), Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1788–1792), France and French-controlled Europe (1789–1814), Haiti (1791–1804), Ireland (1798) and Spanish America (1810–1825). There were smaller upheavals in Switzerland, Russia, and Brazil. The revolutionaries in each country knew of the others and to some degree were inspired by or emulated them.

Independence movements in the New World began with the American Revolution, 1775–1783, in which France, the Netherlands and Spain assisted the new United States of America as it secured independence from Britain. In the 1790s the Haitian Revolution broke out. With Spain tied down in European wars, the mainland Spanish colonies secured independence around 1820.

In long-term perspective, the revolutions were mostly successful. They spread widely the ideals of liberalism, republicanism, the overthrow of aristocracies, kings and established churches. They emphasized the universal ideals of the Enlightenment, such as the equality of all men, including equal justice under law by disinterested courts as opposed to particular justice handed down at the whim of a local noble. They showed that the modern notion of revolution, of starting fresh with a radically new government, could actually work in practice. Revolutionary mentalities were born and continue to flourish to the present day.

The common Atlantic theme breaks down to some extent from reading the works of Edmund Burke. Burke firstly supported the American colonists in 1774 in &quot;On American Taxation&quot;, and took the view that their property and other rights were being infringed by the crown without their consent. In apparent contrast, Burke distinguished and deplored the process of the French revolution in &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), as in this case property, customary and religious rights were being removed summarily by the revolutionaries and not by the crown. In both cases he was following Montesquieu&#x27;s theory that the right to own property is an essential element of personal freedom.

The American Revolution, a pivotal event in the broader context of Atlantic revolutions, led to the emergence of the United States as an independent nation. Its ripple effects resonated across the Atlantic, influencing subsequent independence movements and revolutions in Europe and the Americas. For instance, the Haitian Revolution erupted in the 1790s, challenging colonial rule and inspiring aspirations for freedom and equality. Similarly, mainland Spanish colonies secured their independence around 1820 amid the turmoil of European wars. These interconnected revolutions, fueled by ideals of liberalism and republicanism, sought to overthrow entrenched aristocracies and establish governments based on the principles of the Enlightenment. The revolutionary fervor underscored the belief in the possibility of creating radically new governments founded on the principles of justice and equality, a sentiment that continues to resonate in modern times. However, the Atlantic theme of revolution faced complexities and nuances, as highlighted in the contrasting views of figures like Edmund Burke, who supported the American colonists&#x27; fight against unjust taxation but criticized the French Revolution for its perceived violation of property and religious rights.

Various connecting threads among these varied uprisings include a concern for the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; and freedom of the individual; an idea (often predicated on John Locke or Jean-Jacques Rousseau) of popular sovereignty; belief in a &quot;social contract&quot;, which in turn was often codified in written constitutions; a certain complex of religious convictions often associated with deism and characterized by veneration of reason; abhorrence of feudalism and often of monarchy itself. The Atlantic Revolutions also had many shared symbols, including the name &quot;Patriot&quot; used by so many revolutionary groups; the slogan of &quot;Liberty&quot;; the liberty cap; Lady Liberty or Marianne; the tree of liberty or liberty pole, and so on.

<text>Princes Road Synagogue, officially Liverpool Old Hebrew Congregation, is an Orthodox Jewish congregation and synagogue, located on Princes Road in the Toxteth district of Liverpool, England, in the United Kingdom. The congregation was formed in and worships in the Ashkenazi rite.

The synagogue building was designed by brothers, William James Audsley and George Ashdown Audsley, completed in 1874, and was listed as a Grade I building in 1975. The building is widely regarded as the finest example of the Moorish Revival style of synagogue architecture in the United Kingdom, and a synagogue emulating its design can be found in Sydney, Australia.

==History==
Princes Road Synagogue came into existence when the Jewish community in Liverpool in the late 1860s decided to build a new synagogue, reflecting the status and wealth of the community. The Toxteth area was rapidly expanding as Liverpool&#x27;s magnates built opulent mansions. The synagogue stands in a cluster of houses of worship designed to advertise the wealth and status of the local captains of industry, a group that was remarkably ethnically diverse by the standards of Victorian England; immediately adjacent to the synagogue on Princes Road are the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, the Church of England&#x27;s parish of St Margaret of Antioch, and the Welsh Presbyterian Church.

Construction on the synagogue was completed in 1874. The idea for the synagogue mixed both eastern and western schools of art.

The synagogue was designed by William James Audsley and George Ashdown Audsley, Scottish architect brothers from Edinburgh, and built at a cost of approximately £14,975. It was consecrated on 2 September 1874. The building has been described as &quot;eclectic&quot; and it has been said that the synagogue exemplifies the characteristic eclectic architecture in harmoniously blending features drawn from different styles.

The ladies of the Liverpool Old Hebrew Congregation held a bazaar and luncheon in February 1874. They invited the important dignitaries and arranged for the band of the Coldstream Guards to play. The event raised approximately £3,000 (equivalent to £346,920 in 2020) which was donated to the synagogue for the decoration of the interior. The synagogue is a testament to the wealth and social position of Liverpool&#x27;s 19th-century Jewish magnates, a group with the wealth and taste to also commission Max Bruch to compose the Kol Nidre variations for cello and orchestra.

The synagogue today is attended only on Shabbat mornings and holidays, though it remains popular for weddings and b&#x27;nai mitzvah.

It was re opened after 9 months in August 2021 after having previously been closed due to budgetary issues.

The synagogue was featured prominently in a stamp released for the coronation of King Charles III, intended to celebrate religious diversity.

==Description== 
The synagogue is of brick construction, with bright terracotta bricks being used extensively for decoration. The façade reveals the plan of the building, a basilica with nave and aisles. The central section juts forward from the aisles. It has a large Moorish portal divided by a central column, above which is a large wheel window in the Romanesque style, both deeply recessed in arches.

The synagogue has a central nave with aisles on either side, separated by an arcade carried on slender octagonal columns, which also support galleries over the aisles. The nave has a barrel vault lit by clerestory windows. The interior is notable for its lavish decoration, including gilding and unstinting use of the finest woods and marbles. H. A. Meek was so impressed with the design that he wrote in his 1995 book &quot;The Synagogue&quot;, &quot;He who has not seen the interior of Princes Road Synagogue in Liverpool has not beheld the glory of Israel.&quot;

<text>Bernard Richard Goldberg (born May 31, 1945) is an American author, journalist, and political pundit. Goldberg has won fourteen Emmy Awards and was a producer, reporter and correspondent for CBS News for twenty-eight years (1972–2000) and a paid contributor for Fox News for ten years (2009–2018). He is best-known for his on-going critiques of journalism practices in the United States—as described in his first book published in 2001, &quot;&quot;. He was a correspondent for &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; on HBO for 22 years until January 2021.

==Personal background==
Goldberg was born in New York City in 1945 and graduated from Rutgers University in 1967. Goldberg is of Jewish descent.

==Personal politics==
Though frequently described as a conservative, Goldberg previously rejected the label, describing himself as a life-long liberal modeled after the 1960s ideals of the U.S. Democratic Party. In a February 22, 2012, interview, Goldberg said: &quot;The reason (people claim I&#x27;m conservative) is so I&#x27;ll be automatically marginalized. I wrote in that I would make racial discrimination a criminal offense, not just a civil offense.
On gay rights, I don’t know anyone more Libertarian than me. I don’t want the government getting involved in it. I’m pro-abortion with reservations. I’ve never set foot in a country club in my life. I consider myself to be an old-fashioned liberal. I’m a liberal the way liberals used to be when they were like John F. Kennedy and when they were like Hubert Humphrey, when they were upbeat and enthusiastic and mainstream. I am not a liberal the way liberals are today, at least as exemplified by Al Franken and Michael Moore, where they’re angry, nasty, closed minded, and not mainstream, but fringe. I think this is what really irks the media (about me). That this is coming from one of them. I was one of them for 28 years.&quot;

Goldberg has since accepted the label of &quot;conservative,&quot; saying in 2020, &quot;I see myself as a conservative with live and let live principles… a conservative libertarian I guess. Now, even when I agree with liberals on this issue or that, I no longer want to be on their team. I not only don’t accept their new left wing politics, it’s also their holier than thou elitism that annoys me. I no longer see myself as a liberal. They left me, not the other way around. Now, I’m a conservative. Not a right-wing nut, just a conservative with libertarian tendencies.&quot;

Goldberg has been a frequent critic of President Barack Obama, President Donald Trump, and President Joe Biden.

==Career==
From 1972 to 1974 he worked for CBS News as a producer in Atlanta; he became a reporter in 1974 and correspondent in 1976. Goldberg frequently contributed to the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; and CBS newsmagazines &quot;Eye to Eye with Connie Chung&quot; and &quot;48 Hours&quot;. For CBS, he hosted two primetime documentaries, &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot; and &quot;In Your Face, America&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot; was broadcast on May 26, 1994, and explored alleged irresponsibility of Americans. &quot;In Your Face, America&quot;, which aired on April 7, 1998, said that American culture suffers from a &quot;coarsening&quot; instigated by entertainment such as &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, and gangsta rap music.

In 2001, his first book, &quot;&quot;, was published and became a number one &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

Goldberg followed &quot;Bias&quot; with two books—&quot;Arrogance: Rescuing America from the Media Elite&quot; in 2003 and &quot;100 People Who Are Screwing Up America&quot; in 2005. &quot;Boston Globe&quot; journalist Cathy Young—praised by Goldberg in &quot;100 People&quot;—criticized the book for listing mostly liberal or liberal-leaning individuals and only &quot;a Few Token Right-Wingers&quot;. There were also many favorable comments about the book including one from Jonah Goldberg (no relation) who said, &quot;&quot;100 People Who Are Screwing Up America&quot; is a rollicking and revealing look at 100 of the most egregious obstacles on the path of our nation&#x27;s return to glory&quot; and Brent Bozell, who commented: &quot;&quot;100 People Who Are Screwing Up America&quot; is out, and it&#x27;s a wonderful read for anyone not on that list.&quot;

Goldberg also wrote &quot;Crazies to the Left of Me, Wimps to the Right: How One Side Lost Its Mind, and the Other Lost Its Nerve&quot; in 2007. In 2009, he wrote &quot;A Slobbering Love Affair: The True (And Pathetic) Story of the Torrid Romance Between Barack Obama and the Mainstream Media.&quot;

Goldberg worked as an on-air contributor for Fox News from 2009 to 2018. He served mostly as a media analyst, but also frequently weighed in on U.S. political issues. In 2018, the network, without explanation, pulled Goldberg off the air for the last 11 months of his contract. They made no effort to re-sign (or even contact) him once his contract expired in December of that year. Goldberg believes he was quietly shelved, and ultimately let go, because of his frequent criticisms of President Donald Trump, which upset Fox viewers. In a column describing the experience, Goldberg wrote, &quot;Fox will tolerate a liberal criticizing President Trump ... but the network didn’t want conservatives taking shots at him.  Sometimes I defended the president against what I thought was unfair criticism. But I was also critical of Mr. Trump, of his vindictiveness and his dishonesty... Once they wanted to hear what I said about liberal bias in the news... But now, they didn&#x27;t even want to hear about that from me, not if there was a chance I was going to &quot;also&quot; criticize the president.&quot;

Goldberg worked as a correspondent for &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; on HBO from 1999 to 2021. Goldberg resigned in January 2021, citing frustration with the show&#x27;s increasing political slant and imbalance. 

==Awards==
Goldberg has been awarded an Emmy for journalism 14 times (six at CBS News, eight at HBO). For his June 2000 segment &quot;Dominican Free For All&quot;, in which he investigated corrupt Major League Baseball recruiting practices in the Dominican Republic, Goldberg won a Sports Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Sports Journalism&quot;. He won that award again in 2005 for his story exposing Saudi Arabia&#x27;s illegal use of young boys as camel jockeys, in 2008 for a story about post-concussion syndrome suffered by some former NFL players, and in 2009 for a story on &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; about the slaughter of racehorses that were no longer making money for their owners.

In May, 2011 Goldberg won another sports Emmy, this one for his story on the connection between head trauma suffered by athletes and a disease similar to ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. In April 2012, Goldberg won his 12th Emmy, this one for a report on the College Bowl Money Trail. And in May 2017, he won his 13th Emmy for an investigation of the International Olympic Committee. Later that year, in October 2017, Goldberg won another Emmy, a News Emmy in the Investigative Reporting category, for his story on head injuries in youth football. Goldberg received the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award in 2006 for a story on the exploitation of children in the United Arab Emirates. It marked the first time that a sports program had won a duPont award.

In 2012, Goldberg won his second duPont for a body of work on concussions in the NFL, the duPont committee saying that, &quot;Correspondent Bernard Goldberg&#x27;s interviews are sensitive and probing, moving the story forward. Goldberg and his team investigate the historical precedent of Lou Gehrig bringing to light new information about concussions he suffered as a baseball player at Columbia University and as a Yankee. The reporting raised awareness for the public, the NFL and Congress about this important health issue.

In 2018, Bernie and a team of Real Sports journalists won another duPont-Columbia Award for a story about the Olympics entitled “Lord of the Rings.” As the duPont committee described it: &quot;This ambitious investigative report—filmed in nine countries—exposed graft and corruption in the IOC and detailed how its members pursue wealth, privilege, and self-glory at the expense of the Games.

In 2020, Goldberg and the Real Sports team won the 2019 Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors sports award for their piece &quot;Game Change.&quot; The report focused on the changing demographics of tackle football.

<text>The Rakaia River is in the Canterbury Plains in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The Rakaia River is one of the largest braided rivers in New Zealand. The Rakaia River has a mean flow of and a mean annual seven-day low flow of . In the 1850s, European settlers named it the &quot;Cholmondeley River&quot;, but this name lapsed into disuse. The name &quot;Rakaia&quot; comes from Māori &quot;Ō Rakaia&quot;, meaning the place where people were arranged by ranks.

==Description==
It rises in the Southern Alps, travelling in a generally easterly or southeasterly direction before entering the Pacific Ocean south of Christchurch. It forms a lagoon as it reaches the ocean.

For much of its journey, the river is braided, running through a wide shingle bed. Close to Mount Hutt, however, it is briefly confined to a narrow canyon known as the Rakaia Gorge.

The Rakaia River is bridged in two places. The busiest crossing is at the small town of Rakaia, from the river mouth, where State Highway 1 using Rakaia Bridge and the South Island Main Trunk Railway cross the river using separate bridges. These two bridges are New Zealand&#x27;s longest road and rail bridges respectively, approximately long. A second bridge, much shorter and less used, spans the Rakaia Gorge.

The Central Plains Water Trust is proposing to take up to of water from the Rakaia River as part of the Central Plains Water enhancement scheme.

The Rakaia River is a celebrated Chinook salmon fishery. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of the endangered black-billed gull. The river is also known for its large wrybill population which represents 73 percent of the total population. Other important bird species using the riverbed are black-fronted tern and banded dotterel.

<text>The Opuha Dam is located on the Opuha River, a tributary of the Ōpihi River in South Canterbury, New Zealand. The dam is used for water storage for farming irrigation and provides 7.7 MW of electricity to New Zealand&#x27;s national grid. The site has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of the endangered black-billed gull.

==History==
The dam failed during construction on 6 February 1997 due to heavy rain. It was completed in 1998, creating Lake Opuha.

In 2003 in order to counteract oxygen depletion in the lake an aeration system was installed.

<text>Nicholas G. Carr (born 1959) is an American journalist and writer who has published books and articles on technology, business, and culture. His book &quot;The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains&quot; was a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction.

==Career==
Nicholas Carr originally came to prominence with the 2003 &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; article &quot;IT Doesn&#x27;t Matter&quot; and the 2004 book &quot;Does IT Matter? Information Technology and the Corrosion of Competitive Advantage&quot; (Harvard Business School Press). In these widely discussed works, he argued that the strategic importance of information technology in business has diminished as IT has become more commonplace, standardized and cheaper. His ideas roiled the information technology industry, spurring heated outcries from executives of Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and other leading technology companies, although the ideas got mixed responses from other commentators. In 2005, Carr published the controversial article &quot;The End of Corporate Computing&quot; in the &quot;MIT Sloan Management Review,&quot; in which he argued that in the future companies will purchase information technology as a utility service from outside suppliers.

Carr&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, From Edison to Google&quot;, was published in January 2008 by W. W. Norton. It examines the economic and social consequences of the rise of Internet-based cloud computing, comparing the consequences to those that occurred with the rise of electric utilities in the early 20th century.

In the summer of 2008, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; published Carr&#x27;s article &quot;Is Google Making Us Stupid?&quot; as the cover story of its annual Ideas issue. Highly critical of the Internet&#x27;s effect on cognition, the article has been read and debated widely in both the media and the blogosphere. Carr&#x27;s main argument is that the Internet may have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation.

Carr&#x27;s 2010 book, &quot;The Shallows&quot;, develops this argument further. Discussing various examples ranging from Nietzsche&#x27;s typewriter to London cab drivers&#x27; GPS navigators, Carr shows how newly introduced technologies change the way people think, act and live. The book focuses on the detrimental influence of the Internet—although it does recognize its beneficial aspects—by investigating how hypertext has contributed to the fragmentation of knowledge. When users search the Web, for instance, the context of information can be easily ignored. &quot;We don&#x27;t see the trees,&quot; Carr writes. &quot;We see twigs and leaves.&quot; One of Carr&#x27;s major points is that the change caused by the Internet involves the physical restructuring of the human brain, which he explains using the notion of &quot;neuroplasticity.&quot; In addition to being a Pulitzer Prize nominee, the book appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; nonfiction bestseller list and has been translated into 17 languages.

In 2014, Carr published his fourth book, &quot;The Glass Cage: Automation and Us&quot;, which presents a critical examination of the role of computer automation in contemporary life. Spanning historical, technical, economic, and philosophical viewpoints, the book has been widely acclaimed by reviewers, with the New York Times Sunday Book Review terming it &quot;essential.&quot;

In 2016, Carr published &quot;Utopia Is Creepy: and Other Provocations&quot;, a collection of blog posts, essays, and reviews from 2005 to 2016. The book provides a critique of modern American techno-utopianism, which TIME magazine said &quot;punches a hole in Silicon Valley cultural hubris.&quot;

In 2019, Carr was the Richmond Visiting Professor of Sociology at Williams College.

Earlier in his career, Carr was executive editor of the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;. He has also served as a member of the editorial board of advisors of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

In 2025, Carr published &quot;&quot;, which presents a critique of social media&#x27;s impact on contemporary society.

== Wikipedia critique ==
Through his blog &quot;Rough Type&quot;, Carr has been a critic of technological utopianism and in particular the populist claims made for online social production. 

In his 2005 blog essay titled &quot;The Amorality of Web 2.0,&quot; he criticized the quality of volunteer Web 2.0 information projects such as Wikipedia and the blogosphere and argued that they may have a net negative effect on society by displacing more expensive professional alternatives. In a response to Carr&#x27;s criticism, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales admitted that the Wikipedia articles quoted by Carr &quot;are, quite frankly, a horrific embarrassment&quot; and solicited recommendations for improving Wikipedia&#x27;s quality. 

In May 2007, Carr argued that the dominance of Wikipedia pages in many search results represents a dangerous consolidation of Internet traffic and authority, which may be leading to the creation of what he called &quot;information plantations&quot;. Carr coined the term &quot;wikicrats&quot; (a pejorative description of Wikipedia administrators) in August 2007, as part of a more general critique of what he sees as Wikipedia&#x27;s tendency to develop ever more elaborate and complex systems of rules and bureaucratic ranks or castes over time.

==Education==
Carr holds a B.A. from Dartmouth College and an M.A. in English and American literature and language from Harvard University.

<doc id="1147375" wikidata="Q1673399" url="?curid=1147375" title="Isaac Aboab I">
<text>Rabbi Isaac ben Abraham Aboab (; 1300) also known by his magnum opus, Menorat ha-Maor, was an early 14th century Spanish Talmudic scholar and Kabbalist. He is known for his intellectual approach to rabbinic literature, which he juxtaposed with contemporary Spanish Kabbalah.

== Biography ==
Probably born in Aragon, his father Rav Abraham Aboab, had a close relationship with the Crown of Aragon, being gifted land and a heraldic achievement by James I of Aragon in 1263. In his early years Rabbi Isaac worked as a merchant, later moving to Toledo, Castile around 1300. In Toledo, he headed his own yeshiva, and amongst his pupils was Jacob Berab. He mostly taught Jewish ethics, later serving in the rabbinate in Toledo. Towards the end of his life, he devoted much of his time to literary work and to preaching, as he found that great Talmudic scholars and important seats of learning of his time to be antiquated. In his time, the Jews for whom he wrote still understood and spoke Arabic and he belonged to a period of intellectual decline when men took naturally to eclecticism. He combined extensive rabbinical knowledge with philosophical erudition, and was fond of mystic interpretation of the Mosaic laws and ceremonies. He often quoted Aristotle and Plato, though only from secondary sources, and endeavored to illustrate passages from the Talmud and the midrashic literature, with which he was especially familiar. He is sometimes confused with his great-great-grandson Isaac Aboab II, who was a bible commentator in Castile in the late 15th century.

==Works==
Aboab wrote three books:
#&quot;Aron Ha-Edut&quot; (ארון העדות) (&quot;The Ark of the Testimony&quot;) - The work traces various ritual laws to their Talmudic sources, as well as the decisions of the Geonim and later interpretations. It is divided (following the Ten Commandments) into ten sections, each subdivided into chapters and paragraphs.
#&quot;Shulḥan Ha-Panim&quot; (שלחן הפנים) (&quot;Table of the Showbread&quot;) - The work relates to the prayers and benedictions. It is divided into twelve sections, symbolizing the twelve loaves of the showbread in the Tabernacle. Both works are lost.
#&quot;Menorat Ha-Maor&quot; (מנורת המאור) (&quot;The Menorah of Light&quot;) - The work is a collection of midrashic sermons.

===&quot;Menorat haMaor&quot;===

&quot;Menorat haMaor&quot; has survived and won considerable fame for the author, though in his humility he assures his readers that he composed it chiefly for his own use as a public speaker. But besides this it has contributed probably more than any other medieval book to the popularization of rabbinical lore and to the religious edification and elevation of the masses. It belongs to that class of ethical works which sprang up in the 13th century in a time of reaction against the one-sided manner in which Talmudic studies had been previously pursued.

Aboab says in the preface of this work, &quot;These Talmudists consider it their duty to propose difficult questions and answer them in a witty and subtle manner, but leave unnoticed the precious pearls that lie upon the bed of the Talmudic ocean, the aggadic passages (similar to Midrash) so rich in beauty and sweetness.&quot; He conceived, therefore, the plan of grouping together the rich material stored up in the vast treasure-house of Aggadah from the religious and ethical point of view, and of presenting it in a book, intending by it to illumine the minds and the hearts of his coreligionists. Alluding to the seven-armed Menorah in the Tabernacle, he divided the book into seven sections, each of which bears the title of &quot;Ner&quot; or &quot;Lamp&quot; subdivided into separate parts and chapters. The seven &quot;Nerim&quot; or sections are:

# &quot;Do not chase after luxuries&quot; - Divided into three sections about jealousy, lust, and respect. 
# &quot;Do not speak sinfully&quot; - Divided into ten sections about frivolousness speech, lying, flattery, slander, humiliation of others, keeping secrets, fighting with others, tiredness, life purpose, and the sin of insulting others. 
# &quot;Keep the commandments&quot; - Divided into ten sections about circumcision, the duty of the father to his son, prayer, honouring Shabbat and Yom Kippur, honouring one&#x27;s father and mother, marriage, charity, volunteering, honesty in court, and the pursuance of mitzvoth. 
# &quot;Matters of Talmud Torah&quot; - Divided into four sections about the importance of setting time to learn Torah, the reward of learning Torah, Torah wisdom, and the importance of respecting Torah sages. 
# &quot;Repentance&quot; - Divided into three sections about matters of repentance, the days of repentance, and the torment of sin. 
# &quot;Living in peace&quot; - Divided into two sections about respecting others and advice on how to live peacefully.
# &quot;Humility&quot; - Divided into two sections about the importance of humility and the sin of humiliation. 

Aboab supplied to the average reader a great need of the time. Its skillful arrangement of the various Biblical and rabbinical topics and its warm tone of deep earnestness and sincerity could not fail to appeal to the popular heart. The work was translated into Spanish and read to attentive assemblies of the people, particularly to those not versed in the Law. It thus became the household book of the medieval Jews. It was published with a Spanish translation (Leghorn, 1657), with a Hebrew commentary and a Judæo-German translation by Moses Frankfurter (Amsterdam, 1701), with a modern German translation by Jacob Raphael Fürstenthal and Benzion Behrend (Krotoschin, 1844–46). It was translated also into modern Yiddish, in Wilna, 1880. The book should not be confused with a work of the same name by Israel Alnaqua.

== Abuhav synagogue ==
It is said that after their expulsion from Spain in 1492, Jewish exiles arrived in the Land of Israel carrying a Torah scroll scribed by Rabbi Isaac. Tradition claims that he designed a synagogue while in Spain, incorporating kabbalistic symbols into the design, which served as the building plan for the synagogue named for him in Tsfat, known as the Abuhav Synagogues.

<text>Khalil Ramal (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2011. Ramal ran unsuccessfully in the 2015 federal elections, but finished second to Irene Mathyssen of the rival New Democratic Party. He ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of London in 2022, finishing second to Josh Morgan.

==Background==
Ramal has a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and a Master of Arts degree in social politics from Lebanese University, and has received further diplomas in accounting and teaching. At the time of the 2003 election, he was pursuing a Ph.D. in social politics.

He arrived in Canada in 1989, after leaving war-ravaged Lebanon, and has worked as a teacher, journalist, and as a counsellor with physical and mentally disabled patients at the Oxford Regional Centre in Woodstock, Ontario. He also runs a small business, and has served as Vice President of the Orchard Farm Distribution Company.

==Politics==
Ramal was elected for London—Fanshawe in the 2003 provincial election, defeating New Democrat Irene Mathyssen and incumbent Progressive Conservative Frank Mazzilli in a close three-way race.

On September 27, 2004, Ramal was named parliamentary assistant to Ontario Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.

He was defeated in the 2011 provincial election.

Ramal won the federal Liberal nomination for London—Fanshawe in 2015 but came in second to Irene Mathyssen of the rival New Democratic Party by a difference of around 3600 votes.

In 2022, Ramal announced that he would run for mayor of London, Ontario during the 2022 London, Ontario municipal election. Ramal was ultimately unsuccessful, losing to Josh Morgan who finished with 65.72% of the vote compared to 22.59% for Ramal.

<doc id="1147386" wikidata="Q2130977" url="?curid=1147386" title="Rangitata River">
<text>The Rangitata River is one of the braided rivers of the Canterbury Plains in southern New Zealand. It flows southeast for from the Southern Alps, entering the Pacific Ocean northeast of Timaru. The river has a catchment area of , and a mean annual flow of at Klondyke.

The Māori name &quot;Rangitata&quot; (Rakitata) has been variously translated as &quot;day of lowering clouds&quot;, &quot;close sky&quot;, and &quot;the side of the sky&quot;.

The river formed the Rangitata Valley, in the center of the Southern Alps, and the on-location photography of the Edoras set from &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; was filmed in this valley, on and around Mount Sunday. Several remote sheep stations are located near Mount Sunday. These include Mesopotamia, Mt Potts, and Erewhon. Erewhon was named by Samuel Butler who was the first white settler to live at the Mesopotamia sheep station. Erewhon is also the name of a novel written by Butler anonymously in 1872. In 1932 an outdoor ice skating rink was established by the river beneath Mount Harper.

Before the river enters the Canterbury Plains, the river flows through the Rangitata Gorge where part of it is diverted to the Rangitata Diversion Race (RDR) for irrigation and hydroelectric generation. The RDR was built between 2 April 1937 and 1944, and supplies water to the Montalto and Highbank schemes before joining the Rakaia River. The entry point has New Zealand&#x27;s first acoustic fish fence, keeping salmon smolt in the river and preventing them ending up on farmland.

There is a second irrigation system which has its off take below and on the opposite river bank from the RDR. This system is called the Rangitata South Irrigation Scheme. This system rums through a static fish screen on its way into 7 man made dams, holding a total of 18,000,000 m3 of water to distribute across 16,000ha of formerly dry land farming area. This system has a fish spawning section to help bolster the number of sport fish available for recreational fishermen.

The Rangitata is the most fished river in the Central South Island Region, having a self-sustaining Chinook salmon fishery. The salmon account for about 75 percent of angler activity on the river, other species fished are brown trout, rainbow trout and brook char.

== History ==
Towards its mouth, the river originally split into two streams, forming a large delta island (Rangitata Island). This island was crossed by State Highway 1 and the Main South Line railway between Ealing and Rangitata and thus was an island connected directly by New Zealand&#x27;s main state highway and one of its primary railway lines. However, the south branch of this split has since been blocked, and the riverbed developed for agricultural purposes. Its course remains as a flood plain, but water does not normally flow here any longer.

On 23 December 1999, Fish and Game New Zealand lodged an application for a water conservation order on the Rangitata River. In June 2006, the water conservation order was gazetted.

A locomotive, DC 4686, ended up completely submerged in the river on 4 January 2002, after floodwater undermined a stopbank supporting the railway line, causing a derailment.

In April 2024 a pier of the rail bridge washed away due to heavy rain, which caused the bridge to sag, and was temporarily closed, reopening with a temporary pier a fortnight later, on 26 April.

<text>The Nokia 3100 is a triband-GSM mobile phone announced on 17 June 2003 as an entry-level phone from Nokia and released in September 2003, designed primarily for the newer generation of marketing audience.

The Nokia 3100 was developed from the Nokia 6100 as a successor to the Nokia 3510. The phone was Nokia&#x27;s first in the youth-oriented 3000-series to be equipped with a 128×128 pixel passive colour display (4096 colors/12-bit), and included Java MIDP 1.0, XHTML and WAP browser, GPRS, Pop-Port connectivity and Lithium-ion battery. It is also capable of playing polyphonic MIDI files, which can be used as ringtones.

It is compact in size and lightweight, and also features special lighting effects.

==Features==

The Nokia 3100 uses Nokia&#x27;s Series 40 platform firmware that has large static icons rather than the animated icons of some other Nokia phones.

The phone can send and receive text and multimedia messages with ringtones and images in BMP, JPEG, PNG and GIF formats. The basic 3100 does not have a voice recorder, radio receiver, MP3 player, or camera, while the 3100b variant has voice recording. A camera can be added to the phone via its Pop-Port.

The Nokia 3200 builds on the Nokia 3100, adding things like a built-in CIF-resolution camera from the Nokia 7250i. Despite the 3200 being designated as the successor to the 3100, the 3200 was less popular than the 3100; this kept the 3100 (and its redesign, the 3120) in production while the 3200 was discontinued and replaced by the Nokia 3220.

The Nokia 3200 has the dimensions of 104.5 x 44.2 x 18.7 mm (4.11 x 1.74 x 0.74 in), and the weight of around 86 g (3.03 oz)

== Variants ==
=== Nokia 3100 (RH-19) ===
The basic version, intended to be used in European GSM networks. It works in GSM 900/1800/1900.

=== Nokia 3100b (RH-50) ===
This version intended to be used in American GSM networks. It works in GSM 850/1800/1900.

Differences from the basic 3100:
* The &quot;Grid&quot; (originally the &quot;Line&quot;), an additional main menu interface in the settings menu
* TTY/TTD option in &quot;Menu&quot; → &quot;Settings&quot; → &quot;Enhancement settings&quot; that appears only if the phone has been connected to a headset, TTD, or similar device
* Voice recording during an active call, up to 1 minute
* World clock that displays the time for various time zones

=== Nokia 3105 ===
The CDMA version of the Nokia 3100, working in CDMA2000 1xRTT networks. It is physically similar to the 3100 except for a built-in flashlight and a slightly different shape of the rear battery cover; the phone&#x27;s firmware has more functions than the basic 3100 or 3100b, such as voice tags and voice commands, and the &quot;Organizer&quot; menu.

The Nokia 3105 was used in Australia on the Hutchison Orange network until the closure of the CDMA network in Australia in late 2006. All customers on the Orange network were then moved to Hutchison&#x27;s 3G network &quot;3&quot;.

=== Nokia 3120 ===
Announced in 2004, the Nokia 3120 is a redesigned variant of the 3100. Apart from a more &quot;business-like&quot; face plate, a revised keypad and the inclusion of SmileyWorld-themed content, the 3120 is otherwise identical to the base 3100 variants. In addition to the GSM 3120, the CDMA 3105 was also revised as the Nokia 3125, using the base 3120 faceplate while retaining the 3105 battery cover.

=== Nokia 3120b ===
This version intended to be used in American GSM networks. It works in GSM 850/1800/1900.

=== Nokia 3125 ===
The CDMA version of the Nokia 3120, working in CDMA2000 1xRTT networks. It is physically similar to the 3120 except for a built-in flashlight and a slightly different shape of the rear battery cover; the phone&#x27;s firmware has more functions than the basic 3120 or 3120b, such as voice tags and voice commands, and the &quot;Organizer&quot; menu.

Differences from the basic 3120:
* The &quot;Grid&quot; (originally the &quot;Line&quot;), an additional main menu interface in the settings menu
* TTY/TTD option in &quot;Menu&quot; → &quot;Settings&quot; → &quot;Enhancement settings&quot; that appears only if the phone has been connected to a headset, TTD, or similar device
* Voice recording during an active call, up to 1 minute
* World clock that displays the time for various time zones

<doc id="1147402" wikidata="Q1165036" url="?curid=1147402" title="Stratfor">
<text>Strategic Forecasting Inc., commonly known as Stratfor, is an American strategic intelligence publishing company founded in 1996. Stratfor&#x27;s business model is to provide individual and enterprise subscriptions to Stratfor Worldview, its online publication, and to perform intelligence gathering for corporate clients. The focus of Stratfor&#x27;s content is security issues and analyzing geopolitical risk.

==History==

The origin of Stratfor can be traced to the Center for Geopolitical Studies (CGPS) at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. There, professors George Friedman and Leonard Hochberg built a team that researched geopolitics, built wargaming simulations, and advised companies on geopolitical risks and opportunities.

The company was founded in 1996 and named Strategic Forecasting (Stratfor) by lead analyst Matthew S. Baker. It was moved to Austin in August 1997 with seven members of the CGPS team who served as part of the co-founding team along with founder George Friedman.

George served as the head of analysis for the organization, and the business was led by several CEOs in the late 1990s and early 2000s as it refined its offerings. Chip Harmon was appointed president in February 2018.

Stratfor was acquired by RANE in 2020. 

==Structure and operations==
Stratfor clients have included academic institutions, investment firms, and large corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, the Coca-Cola Company, and Dow Chemical Company. Many of Stratfor&#x27;s operatives previously worked for the U.S. government.

Media coverage of their ideas about the 1998 bombing of Iraq brought Stratfor into the public eye. At this time, the company had about twenty employees. By 2008 they were up to 40 full-time employees in Austin. 2016 saw the number rise to about 100, three-quarters of whom were based in Austin. Stratfor often hired and trained interns from the nearby University of Texas.

Stratfor analysts pay for information, but also use open source information to predict where global crises will arise. Stratfor also obtains information by way of personal networks. Fred Burton indicated in leaked emails that he maintained contact with his trusted former CIA sources as a source of information, and that he was aware of the sealed indictment against Julian Assange in 2011. &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; Jonathan Laing has called Stratfor founder George Friedman &quot;one of our favorite experts on geopolitics,&quot; saying, &quot;His judgments tend to be more nuanced and long-term than those of the press or Wall Street.&quot; More recently, &quot;The Atlantic&#x27;s&quot; James Fallows referenced a Stratfor article on U.S. strategy in Iraq and Ukraine, following outbreaks of turmoil in those regions.

Friedman resigned from the company in 2015 to launch a new company, Geopolitical Futures.

Dun &amp; Bradstreet&#x27;s estimate of Stratfor&#x27;s 2021 revenue is $11.61 million.

===Funding===
In October 2015, Stratfor raised $12 million in funding through a growth equity investment by Dallas-based Teakwood Capital. Stratfor planned to use the funds to expand its reporting networks, improve operational infrastructure, and move into new markets.

==Products==
In April 2017, the company launched its core online publication under the name Stratfor Worldview. 

==Books==
Kamran Bokhari, Stratfor&#x27;s former vice president for Middle East and South Asian affairs, co-wrote &quot;Political Islam in the Age of Democratization&quot; (2013). Reviewer Amani el Sehrawey called the book &quot;an invaluable tool for those seeking to gain knowledge of the nuances of the political systems of the Muslim world from a historical perspective, as well as to understand the contemporary changes happening in the region.&quot;

== Hack and publication of emails ==

On December 24, 2011, Stratfor&#x27;s website was hacked. Anonymous claimed responsibility, and also posted data they claim was taken from Stratfor, including credit card details, passwords, and addresses of Stratfor clients. Their email system was also compromised.

In November 2013, computer hacker Jeremy Hammond was sentenced to ten years in federal prison for his role in the Anonymous attack. An FBI informant, Hector Xavier Monsegur (also known as &quot;Sabu&quot;), initially faced 124 years in prison for his role in the attack, but his sentence was reduced to time served plus one year&#x27;s supervised release in May 2014 in exchange for his cooperation as an FBI informant.

WikiLeaks announced the initial publication of more than five million of Stratfor&#x27;s e-mail messages on February 26, 2012, under the name Global Intelligence Files. Anonymous said it had leaked the emails to WikiLeaks. 
George Friedman stated that third parties may have forged or altered the e-mail messages, but that Stratfor would not validate either alterations or authenticity.
Stratfor condemned the release.

<text>George Friedman (, born February 1, 1949) is a Hungarian-born American futurologist, political scientist, and writer. He is a geopolitical author on international relations. He is the founder and chairman of &quot;Geopolitical Futures&quot;. Prior to founding &quot;Geopolitical Futures&quot;, he was chairman of the publishing company Stratfor.

==Early life and education==
Friedman was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1949 to Jewish parents who survived the Holocaust. His family immigrated to the United States. Friedman describes his family&#x27;s story as &quot;a very classic story of refugees making a new life in America.&quot; He grew up in New York City. Friedman received a B.A. at the City College of New York, where he majored in political science, and a Ph.D. in government at Cornell University.

==Career==
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he studied potential for a Japan-U.S. conflict and co-authored with his wife &quot;The Coming War with Japan&quot; in 1991. The war he predicted did not occur.

Friedman spent nearly 20 years in academia, during which time he taught political science at Dickinson College.

In 1996, Friedman founded Stratfor, a private intelligence and forecasting company, and served as the company&#x27;s CEO and Chief Intelligence Officer. Stratfor&#x27;s head office is in Austin, Texas. He resigned from Stratfor in May 2015. That year, he founded Geopolitical Futures.

Friedman&#x27;s reputation as a forecaster of geopolitical events led &quot;The New York Times&quot; magazine to comment, in a profile, &quot;There is a temptation, when you are around George Friedman, to treat him like a Magic 8 Ball&quot;.

In &quot;The Next Decade&quot;, Friedman argues how the U.S. administrations of the 2010s will need to create regional power balances by creating competing relationships, which offset one another, in the world&#x27;s different regions. For example, in the past, Iraq balanced Iran, and currently Japan balances China. Friedman asserts this is the decade where the U.S. as a power must mature to manage its power and balance as an empire and republic.

Friedman&#x27;s latest book, &quot;The Storm Before the Calm: America&#x27;s Discord, the Coming Crisis of the 2020s, and the Triumph Beyond,&quot; was released in 2020 by Doubleday.

==Personal life==
Friedman is married to Meredith Friedman (née LeBard), has four children, and lives in Austin, Texas. He and his wife have co-authored several publications, including &quot;The Coming War with Japan&quot;.

<text>Ein Gedi (, ), also spelled En Gedi, meaning &quot;spring of the kid&quot;, is an oasis, an archeological site and a nature reserve in Israel, located west of the Dead Sea, near Masada and the Qumran Caves. Ein Gedi, a kibbutz, was established nearby in 1954.

Ein Gedi is a popular tourist attraction and was listed in 2016 as one of the most popular nature sites in Israel. The site attracts about one million visitors a year.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ein Gedi&quot; is composed of two words (In both Arabic and Hebrew): &quot;ein&quot; means spring or a fountain and &quot;gǝdi&quot; means goat-kid. Ein Gedi thus means &quot;kid spring&quot; or &quot;fountain of the kid&quot;. The Hebrew name is also transliterated as &#x27;En Gedi, En-gedi, Eggadi, Engaddi, and Engedi; the Arabic name as &#x27;Ain Jidi and &#x27;Ein Jidi. The archaeological mound (tell) is known in Hebrew as Tel Goren and in Arabic as Tell el-Jurn or Tell Jurn. The site has been identified with the biblical Hazazon Tamar (חַצְצוֹן תָּמָר &quot;ḥaṣṣōn tāmār&quot;, &quot;portion [of land] of date palms&quot;), on account of the palm groves which surrounded it. It is also written Hazazon-tamar, Hazazontamar, Hatzatzon-Tamar, Hazezon Tamar, and Hazezontamar.

==History and archaeology==
===Neolithic to Iron Age===
At Mikveh Cave archaeologists found Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) flint tools and an arrowhead. A Chalcolithic temple (ca. mid-fourth millennium BCE) belonging to the Ghassulian culture was excavated on the slope between two springs, Ein Shulamit and Ein Gedi. More Chalcolithic finds were made at the Moringa and Mikveh Caves. No traces of Bronze Age settlement have been found at Ein Gedi. The remains of the Iron Age settlement at Ein Gedi are located at a tell on the north bank of Wadi Arugot, known in Arabic as Tell el-Jurn (grid position 187/097 PAL) and in Hebrew as Tel Goren. The first permanent Iron Age settlement was Judean and was established around 630 BCE. The site was destroyed or abandoned after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 587/86 BCE.

===Hebrew Bible===
In , Ein Gedi is enumerated among the wilderness cities of the Tribe of Judah in the desert of Betharaba, and in , it is prophesied that one day, its coastal location will make it into a fishing village, after the water of the Dead Sea has been made sweet:
:&quot;Fishing nets will be spread from En-gedi to En-eglaim&quot;.

Fleeing from King Saul, David hides in the strongholds at Ein Gedi ( and ) and Saul seeks him &quot;even upon the most craggy rocks, which are accessible only to wild goats&quot; (). Psalm 63, subtitled &quot;a Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah&quot;, has been associated with David&#x27;s sojourn in the desert of En-gedi.

In Ein Gedi is identified with &quot;Hazazon-tamar&quot;, &quot;Hazezon Tamar&quot;, &quot;Hatzatzon-Tamar&quot; or &quot;Hazezontamar&quot; (חַצְצוֹן תָּמָר &quot;ḥaṣṣōn tāmār&quot;, &quot;portion [of land] of date palms&quot;), on account of the palm groves which surrounded it, where the Moabites and Ammonites gathered in order to fight Josaphat, king of Judah. In &quot;Hazazon-tamar&quot; is mentioned as being an Amorite city, smitten by Chedorlaomer in his war against the cities of the plain.

The Song of Songs () speaks of the &quot;vineyards of Ein Gedi&quot;. The words of Ecclesiasticus 24:18, &quot;I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades&quot; (&#x27;en aígialoîs), may perhaps be understood as the palm trees of Ein Gedi.

===Persian, Hellenistic, and early Roman periods===
The settlement at Tel Goren is a rare example of a town which reached its zenith during the Persian period, probably during the late 5th century BCE. Ein Gedi receives a fortress under Hellenistic rule and becomes a royal Hasmonean estate. According to Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, Ein Gedi served as the capital of a toparchy, and there were excellent palm trees and balsam growing there. The date palm&#x27;s fruit and the balsam plant&#x27;s fragrance were essential to the village&#x27;s economy. The balsam plant also served as a source for expensive medications.

During the First Jewish-Roman War, the Sicarii, who fought the Romans until their defeat and mass suicide at Masada, plundered local villages including Ein Gedi. At Ein Gedi, they drove out the defenders, and killed over seven hundred women and children who could not run away. Pliny claims that Ein Gedi was destroyed during the war, although the Babatha archive shows that Jews lived there once again during the reign of Hadrian and probably earlier. The Babatha archive mentions Ein Gedi as a crown property; the Cohors I Milliaria Thracum is attested there, indicating the presence of Roman soldiers there at the time. The Babatha archive also refers to Ein Gedi as &quot;a village in the territory of Jericho in Judaea&quot;. This evidence led researchers to believe that Ein Gedi was no longer a toparchy in its own right following the First Jewish-Roman War and had instead become a village inside the toparchy of Jericho.

===Late Roman and Byzantine periods===
Ein Gedi survived the catastrophic results of the Bar Kokhba revolt and continued to exist until the sixth or seventh centuries. Eusebius described Ein Gedi as &quot;a large Jewish village&quot; in his early fourth-century &quot;Onomasticon&quot;. In the early third century CE, a synagogue was built in the center of the village. Its remains include a Hebrew and Judeo-Aramaic inscription mosaic now on display at Jerusalem&#x27;s National Archaeology Campus warning inhabitants against &quot;revealing the town&#x27;s secret&quot; – possibly the methods for extraction and preparation of the much-prized balsam resin, though not stated outright in the inscription – to the outside world.

Ein Gedi was destroyed in a fire during the late Byzantine period. According to the archaeologists who excavated the synagogue, the village was destroyed during the early 6th century by Byzantine emperor Justinian as part of his persecution campaign against Jews in his empire. Others claim that the village was destroyed in a Bedouin raid that occurred before the Persian invasion, probably around the late 6th or early 7th century.

After Ein Gedi was destroyed, the cultivation of balsam around the Dead Sea ceased, and it is believed that its Jewish residents, who were now refugees, took the knowledge of cultivating the balsam with them, causing this knowledge to be lost forever.

===Late Ottoman period===
In 1838, Edward Robinson reported that the whole area was covered with gardens, mainly cucumbers, all belonging to the &quot;Rashaideh&quot; tribe. In April 1848, Lieutenant William Francis Lynch led an American expedition down the Jordan River into the Dead Sea, that stopped at Ein Gedi (Ain Jidy).

===Israel===
====&quot;Essenes site&quot;====
In 1998–99, the archaeological expedition of Yizhar Hirschfeld at Ein Gedi systematically excavated what has been called &quot;the Essenes site&quot;, first discovered by Yohanan Aharoni in 1956.

====Kibbutz====
Kibbutz Ein Gedi, founded in 1953, is located about a kilometer from the oasis. It offers various tourist attractions and takes advantage of the local weather patterns and the abundance of natural water to cultivate out-of-season produce. Part of the kibbutz&#x27;s inhabited area is landscaped as an internationally acclaimed botanical garden, covering an area of 100 dunams (10 ha, 24.7 acres) and holding more than 900 species of plants from all over the world.It is the only populated botanical garden in the world. The kibbutz is also home to the Ein Gedi Eco Park, which functions as both a zoo and an environmental education center, demonstrating sustainable technologies such as solar cookers, greywater systems, mud buildings, and compost toilets.

==National parks: an antiquities park, and a nature-reserve-cum-antiquities==
===Antiquities National Park===

The Late Roman- and Byzantine-period synagogue and the village remains around it is run as a separate, archaeological park, distinct from the nature reserve and the antiquities contained therein. The Antiquities National Park centered on the synagogue was declared in 2002 and covers an area of 8 dunams ( or ).

===Nature reserve: natural and archaeological sites===
Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, declared at the end of 1971 and expanded in 1988, is one of the most important reserves in Israel. It is situated on the eastern slopes of the Judean Desert, bordering to the east on the Dead Sea, and covers an area of 14000 dunams ( or ). The elevation ranges from the level of the Dead Sea at 423 meters (1,388 ft) below sea level, to the plateau of the Judean Desert at 200 meters above sea level. The nature reserve includes two streams flowing year-round and each fed by a perennial spring: Nahal David with Ein David (&#x27;David&#x27;s Spring&#x27;), and Nahal Arugot with Ein Arugot (&#x27;Terraces Spring&#x27;). Two further springs, the Shulamit and Ein Gedi springs, also flow in the reserve. Together, the springs generate approximately three million cubic meters of water per year. Much of the water is used for agriculture or is bottled for consumption.
The reserve is a sanctuary for many types of plant, bird and animal species. The vegetation includes plants and trees from the tropical, desert, Mediterranean, and steppian regions, such as Sodom apple, acacia, jujube, and poplar. The many species of resident birds are supplemented by over 200 additional species during the migration periods in the spring and fall. Mammal species include the Nubian ibex and the rock hyrax.

====Archaeology====
Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, administered separately from the Ein Gedi archaeology park (see above), features several archaeological sites including a rare Chalcolithic shrine, but also Tel Goren, an archaeological mound with Iron Age remains corresponding to Hazazon-tamar, a city mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and inhabited on and off till the Byzantine period, two water-powered flour mills from the Mamluk period, etc.

==Sinkholes==
Ein Gedi has been subject to a large number of sinkholes appearing in the area, which have even damaged the highway built in 2010 which was supposedly built to a &quot;sinkhole-proof&quot; design. The sinkholes are due to the decline in the water level of the Dead Sea, at an annual rate of more than a metre, which is attributed to the battle for scarce water resources in the very arid region. The sinkholes form as a result of the receding shoreline (with the surface of the Sea having shrunk by about 33 per cent since the 1960s), where a thick layer of underground salt is left behind. When fresh water arrives in the form of heavy rains, it dissolves the salt as it sinks into the ground, forming an underground cavity, which eventually collapses under the weight of the surface ground layer.

Tourism has been affected by the receding shoreline and the sinkholes, and the amount of water from the rains reaching the sea has diminished since flash floods started pouring into the sinkholes. Huge cave systems called karsts convey water underground between the sinkholes. Scientists in the floodplain area south of Ein Gedi have been using cameras, water testing, videos using drones and satellite monitoring to map the area for safety.

<text>Satchel Ronan O&#x27;Sullivan Farrow (born December 19, 1987) is an American journalist. The son of actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen, he is known for his investigative reporting on sexual abuse allegations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. The magazine won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for this reporting, sharing the award with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Farrow has worked for UNICEF and as a government advisor.

==Early life and education==
Farrow was born on December 19, 1987, in New York City to actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen. He is their only biological child. His mother&#x27;s family is Catholic and his father is Jewish. His given names honor National Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige and maternal grandmother, Irish-American actress Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan. Now known as Ronan, he was given the surname &quot;Farrow&quot; to avoid confusion. His siblings have the surnames Previn, from those born or adopted during his mother&#x27;s marriage to composer Andre Previn, and Farrow, for children she adopted after she and Previn divorced.

As a child, Farrow skipped grades in school and took courses with the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. At age 11, he began his studies at Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock, later transferring to Bard College for a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. He graduated at age 15, the youngest to do so at that institution.

He entered Yale Law School, from which he received a Juris Doctor in 2009. He later passed the New York State Bar examination. Selected as a Rhodes Scholar, Farrow earned a Doctor of Philosophy in political science from the University of Oxford, where he was a student of Magdalen College. His dissertation was titled &quot;Shadow armies: political representation and strategic reality in America&#x27;s proxy wars&quot; and was supervised by Desmond King.

==Career==
===Public service===
From 2001 to 2009, Farrow served as a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth, advocating for children and women caught up in the ongoing crisis in Sudan&#x27;s Darfur region and assisting in fundraising and addressing United Nations affiliated groups in the United States. During this time, he also made joint trips to the Darfur region of Sudan with his mother, who is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He subsequently advocated for the protection of Darfuri refugees. Following his time in Sudan, Farrow was affiliated with the Genocide Intervention Network.

During his studies at Yale Law School, Farrow interned at the law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and in the office of the chief counsel at the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, focusing on international human rights law.

In 2009, Farrow joined the Obama administration, as Special Adviser for Humanitarian and NGO Affairs in the Office of the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. He was part of a team recruited by diplomat Richard Holbrooke, for whom Farrow had previously worked as a speechwriter. For the next two years, Farrow was responsible for &quot;overseeing the U.S. Government&#x27;s relationships with civil society and nongovernmental actors&quot; in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In 2011, Farrow was appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as her Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues and Director of the State Department&#x27;s Office of Global Youth Issues. The office was created as a result of a multi-year task-force appointed by Clinton to review the United States&#x27; economic and social policies on youth. Farrow co-chaired the working group with senior United States Agency for International Development staff member David Barth beginning in 2010. Farrow&#x27;s appointment and the creation of the office were announced by Clinton as part of a refocusing on youth following the Arab Spring revolutions. Farrow was responsible for U.S. youth policy and programming with an aim toward &quot;empower[ing] young people as economic and civic actors.&quot; Farrow concluded his term as Special Adviser in 2012, with his policies and programs continuing under his successor.

===Journalism===

After leaving government, Farrow began a Rhodes Scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He studied toward a DPhil, researching the exploitation of the poor in developing countries, and submitted his thesis in October 2018.

He has written essays, op-eds, and other pieces for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and other periodicals. In October 2013, Penguin Press acquired Farrow&#x27;s book, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box: How American Military Aid Creates America&#x27;s Enemies&quot;, scheduling it for 2015 publication.

From February 2014 through February 2015, Farrow hosted &quot;Ronan Farrow Daily&quot;, a television news program that aired on MSNBC.

Farrow hosted the investigative segment &quot;Undercover with Ronan Farrow&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. Launched in June 2015, the series was billed as providing Farrow&#x27;s look at the stories &quot;you don&#x27;t see in the headlines every day&quot;, often featuring crowd-sourced story selection and covering topics from the labor rights of nail salon workers to mental healthcare issues to sexual assault on campus.

On May 11, 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; published a guest column by Farrow in which he drew comparisons between the long-term absence of journalistic inquiry into the rape allegations leveled against Bill Cosby and the sexual abuse allegations levied against his father Woody Allen by Farrow&#x27;s sister Dylan Farrow (who was 7 years old at the time of the alleged abuse). Farrow detailed first-hand accounts of journalists, biographers, and major publications purposefully omitting from their work decades of rape allegations targeting Cosby. Similarly, Farrow recounts the efforts of Allen&#x27;s publicist, Leslee Dart, to mount a media campaign focused on countering Dylan Farrow&#x27;s allegations, while at the same time vindicating Allen:
 Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the e‑mails blasted out by Allen&#x27;s powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a robust publicity campaign to validate my father&#x27;s sexual relationship with another one of my siblings. Those e‑mails featured talking points ready-made to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer—therapists, lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points – a self-perpetuating spin machine.

Farrow reiterated his support for Dylan and expressed his unwavering belief in her allegations:
I believe my sister. This was always true as a brother who trusted her and, even at 5 years old, was troubled by our father&#x27;s strange behavior around her: Climbing into her bed in the middle of the night, forcing her to suck his thumb – behavior that had prompted him to enter into therapy focused on his inappropriate conduct with children prior to the allegations.

In closing his guest column, Farrow expressed his view of media culture as one that actively discourages victims of abuse from coming forward. Farrow said that victims are pressured to remain silent by threat of &quot;having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures&quot; and &quot;going up against angry fans and angry publicists&quot;. Farrow&#x27;s regard for Hollywood (and media in general), as represented in his 2016 &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; guest column, foreshadows his investigation into the alleged misconduct of Harvey Weinstein. His reporting on this was published the following year.

On October 10, 2017, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an investigative article by Farrow detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against film producer Harvey Weinstein five days after &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the findings of its own investigation into Weinstein. It was subsequently revealed that Farrow originally worked on the story for NBC and that the network decided against airing his initial findings. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for Farrow&#x27;s reporting, sharing the award with Jodi Kantor and Meghan Twohey at &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2018 Farrow was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot; list. On May 7, 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published a joint article by Farrow and reporter Jane Mayer stating that New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved during his term in office, and that he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs. Schneiderman resigned within hours of publication of the article on the following day. Mayer and Farrow reported that they had confirmed the women&#x27;s allegations with photographs of contusions and with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman said that he resigned because they &quot;effectively prevent me from leading the office&#x27;s work&quot;. Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman.

On July 27, 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an article by Farrow saying that six women had accused media executive and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves of harassment and intimidation, and that dozens more described abuse at his company. On August 23, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an article by Adam Entous and Farrow stating that top aides of the Trump White House circulated a conspiracy memo entitled &quot;The Echo Chamber&quot; about President Barack Obama&#x27;s aides.

On September 14, 2018, Farrow and Jane Mayer published information pertaining to an allegation of sexual assault against lawyer, jurist, and then-United States Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

In early 2019, Farrow said he and another journalist received demands from American Media, Inc. that sought to extort or blackmail him. He investigated the concealment by the MIT Media Lab of its involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, leading to the resignation of Joi Ito, director of the Media Lab, and an internal investigation by MIT.

On July 3, 2021, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an investigative article by Farrow and journalist Jia Tolentino detailing the Britney Spears conservatorship dispute. The article described the events related to the establishment of the conservatorship, alleged that Britney Spears was subject to a variety of abuses under her father Jamie Spears&#x27;s control, and included testimonies from various named sources close to Britney.

===Film and television work===
Farrow became involved in popular entertainment as well. He voiced minor characters in the English-language versions of two Japanese animated films, &quot;From Up on Poppy Hill&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013). He also guest starred as himself on the Netflix comedy series &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;.

Farrow appeared on the daytime talk show &quot;The View&quot; as a guest co-host on December 3, 2019. Farrow starred as a Guest Judge on Ru Paul&#x27;s &quot;Drag Race All Stars 7 All Winners&quot; in episode 10: &quot;The Kennedy Davenport Center Honors Hall of Shade&quot;, airing on July 15, 2022. He sat alongside Ru Paul, Michelle Visage, and Ross Mathews. In 2024, he was a guest judge on the fourteenth episode of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; season 16 (episode &quot;Booked and Blessed&quot;). He also has a small motion-capture role in the 2024 remake of the video game &quot;Riven&quot;.

In January 2018, Farrow signed a three-year deal at HBO to produce and develop documentaries. Farrow served as an executive producer on &quot;Endangered&quot; directed by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, focusing on threats against journalists which released in June 2022. In 2024, Farrow starred and produced &quot;Surveilled&quot; focusing on cyberintelligence firm NSO Group.

==Recognition==
In 2008, Farrow was awarded Refugees International&#x27;s McCall-Pierpaoli Humanitarian Award for &quot;extraordinary service to refugees and displaced people&quot;. In 2009, Farrow was named &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;New Activist&quot; of the year and included on its list of individuals &quot;on the verge of changing their worlds&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; listed him as an &quot;up-and-coming politician&quot;. In 2012, he was ranked number one in &quot;Law and Policy&quot; on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;30 Under 30&quot; Most Influential People. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Dominican University of California in 2012. In its 2013 retrospective of men born in its 80 years of publication, &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine named him the man of the year of his birth.

In February 2014, Farrow received the third annual Cronkite Award for &quot;Excellence in Exploration and Journalism&quot; from Reach the World, in recognition of his work since 2001, including his being a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth in 2001. Some media outlets noted that the award came three days after &quot;Ronan Farrow Daily&quot; began airing and suggested that the award was therefore not justified. Farrow is the recipient of the Stonewall Community Foundation&#x27;s 2016 Vision Award for his reporting on transgender issues. He was also recognized by the Point Foundation in 2018, receiving the Point Courage Award for his in-depth reporting on #MeToo. In July 2018, Farrow won the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association&#x27;s Journalist of the Year award. In 2019, he was listed among the 40 Under 40 List put out by &quot;Connecticut Magazine&quot;. He was also named the &quot;Out&quot;100 Journalist of the Year.

In May 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Ben Smith published an article titled &quot;Is Ronan Farrow Too Good to Be True?&quot; and asserted that some of Farrow&#x27;s journalism did not hold up to scrutiny. Farrow stated in a response that he stood by his reporting. In a &quot;Slate&quot; piece, Ashley Feinberg described Smith&#x27;s report as an &quot;overcorrection for resistance journalism&quot; and opined that his approach showed &quot;broad-mindedness, sacrificing accuracy for some vague, centrist perception of fairness.&quot;

The audiobook for Farrow&#x27;s book &quot;Catch and Kill&quot;, read by Farrow himself, was nominated for Best Spoken Word Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.

==Personal life==
As of August 2019, Farrow resided on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He publicly identified as part of the LGBT community in 2018.

Farrow began dating podcast host and former presidential speech writer Jon Lovett in 2011. The two became engaged in 2019 after Farrow wrote a proposal to Lovett in the draft for his book &quot;Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators&quot;. The couple bought a $1.87 million home in Los Angeles in August 2019. In March 2023, Lovett stated on his podcast that the couple had separated.

===Relationship to Woody Allen and paternity===
Farrow is estranged from his father, Woody Allen. After Allen married Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and André Previn, Farrow commented, &quot;He&#x27;s my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.&quot;

In a 2013 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Mia Farrow said that Ronan could &quot;possibly&quot; be the biological child of singer Frank Sinatra, with whom she said she had &quot;never really split up.&quot; Ronan Farrow tweeted, &quot;Listen, we&#x27;re all *possibly* Frank Sinatra&#x27;s son.&quot; In a 2015 &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; interview, Sinatra&#x27;s daughter Nancy dismissed the suggestion that her father was Farrow&#x27;s biological father, calling it &quot;nonsense&quot;. She said that her father had a vasectomy years before Farrow&#x27;s birth. Sinatra&#x27;s biographer James Kaplan also disputes Sinatra&#x27;s potential paternity of Farrow in his book &quot;Sinatra: The Chairman&quot; (2015). He said that Sinatra was splitting his time between Hawaii and Palm Springs with his wife Barbara Marx Sinatra and was in ill health during the time when Farrow would have been conceived.

Farrow has refused to discuss DNA analysis. He has said that, despite their estrangement, &quot;Woody Allen, legally, ethically, personally was absolutely a father in our family.&quot; In a 2018 &quot;New York&quot; magazine article, Allen said that Farrow may not be his biological son: &quot;In my opinion, he&#x27;s my child ... I think he is, but I wouldn&#x27;t bet my life on it. I paid for child support for him for his whole childhood, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very fair if he&#x27;s not mine.&quot;

<text>General Motors Diesel was a railway diesel locomotive manufacturer located in London, Ontario, Canada. It was established in 1949 as the Canadian subsidiary of the Electro-Motive Diesel division of General Motors (EMD). In 1969 it was re-organized as the &quot;Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada, Ltd.&quot; The plant was re-purposed to include manufacture of other diesel-powered General Motors vehicles such as buses. Following the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in 1989, all of EMD&#x27;s locomotives were built at the London facility. In 2005 new owners of EMD renamed the Canadian subsidiary &quot;Electro-Motive Canada&quot;. The plant was closed by EMD&#x27;s new owner Progress Rail in 2012, with EMD&#x27;s production remaining in LaGrange, Illinois and Muncie, Indiana.

==History==
===Early diesel locomotive manufacturing in Canada===
Diesel-electric locomotives were built in Canada beginning in 1928. The earliest diesels were custom built one-of-a-kind designs such as Canadian Nationals numbers 9000 and 9001 and Canadian Pacific number 7000. After these unique locomotives, steam remained in favor for road service owing to the higher initial costs and lower reliability of early diesel locomotives. The benefit of diesels was largely their reduced operating costs compared to steam, but they had to be kept going to pay for themselves. Increased use was key to their cost benefits. The greatest savings were to be had in yard service, where switching often meant idling that maximized the efficiency advantages of diesel over steam. Through the 1930s into the 1940s the largest market for diesel-electric locomotives was for switchers such as the ALCO S-2 and the EMD NW2.

Tariffs protected Canadian manufacturers against imported goods, thus many companies wanting to do business in Canada set up controlled or wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada. General Motors Diesel, Ltd., was EMD&#x27;s subsidiary organized for that purpose. Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in Montreal served a similar purpose for the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and the Canadian Locomotive Company (CLC) in Kingston served a similar purpose for Baldwin Locomotive Works. MLW and CLC also produced steam and diesel engines of their own designs. The growing market for diesels in Canada meant it became worthwhile to build facilities in Canada to avoid import duties. While MLW and CLC both utilized existing steam locomotive erecting shops in Montreal and Kingston, respectively; General Motors, never having built steam locomotives, required a new facility.

===GMD operations===
General Motors Diesel selected a site on the outskirts of London, Ontario, for this plant. It opened in 1950, eventually expanding several times to 208 acres (842,000 m2) and branching out into building transit buses, earth movers (Terex 1965-1980) and military vehicles built at adjacent facilities. Originally designed to produce one unit per day, it took some time for the volume of orders to reach this level. Plant capacity was later expanded to one-and-a-half units per day. By comparison, La Grange, as the US plant was referred to, eventually could produce six units per day.

The first diesel locomotive built was Toronto, Hamilton &amp; Buffalo Railway (TH&amp;B) number 71, one of four model GP7 1,500 hp (1100 kW) road switchers. It was however, not the first order (C-100) received, which was from Canadian Pacific for ten model FP7A 1,500 hp (1100 kW) A units of the &quot;covered wagon&quot; style of carbody. The two orders were on the shop floor under construction at the same time and it was TH&amp;B 71 which was completed first and delivered on August 25 along with 72. Pairs of A units were delivered commencing with CP numbers 4028 and 4029 on September 14 and continuing until November 11.

TH&amp;B 71 cost $191,712 at the time. For comparison, Alco 1,000 hp (750 kW) yard switchers built in Schenectady, New York cost $115,000 including import duty.

GMD built units for export, a significant amount of business supported by government grants to foreign countries. GMD also built some experimental diesel-hydraulic locomotives and straight electric units as well, although neither were more than a tiny percentage of production.

General Motors Diesel Ltd. became the &quot;Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada Ltd.&quot; on February 1, 1969, in a consolidation of all Canadian properties.

Once dominant in North American diesel locomotive production having seen Baldwin, Fairbanks-Morse, Lima-Hamilton, Alco, MLW and CLC all fall by the wayside in the railway market, General Motors fell under intense competition from General Electric (GE). During the 1950s GE expanded beyond its early production of small locomotives, much of it for small and medium size industries, into large mainline road locomotives for Class I railroads. With excess capacity at the London operation following the peak demand years of the 1950s, GMC Truck and Coach Division used it for production of heavy road vehicles such as buses. The plant was also used for production of construction equipment and light armored vehicles under contract. EMD moved all locomotive construction to London in 1991, after which the London plant supplied US customers under the Free Trade agreement between Canada and the United States. Some primary equipment manufacturing, such as engines, generators, and traction motors, remained at EMD&#x27;s LaGrange, Illinois facility. Meanwhile, locomotives were exported to Argentina, Bengal, Brazil, Ceylon, Liberia, Sweden, New Zealand; Norway and Pakistan.

===Ownership changes===
In the 2000s, GM reorganized the Canadian Diesel Division holdings and separated a portion out under the name &quot;GM Defense&quot;. After a successful joint venture company between General Dynamics Land Systems and GM Defense (the &quot;GM-GDLS Defense Group Ltd&quot;) with the award of the US Army Stryker contract, the defense side of the Canadian operations was sold to General Dynamics in 2003.

On April 4, 2005, GM sold its EMD subsidiary with its London and LaGrange operations to a partnership between Greenbriar Equity Group and Berkshire Partners. The company was renamed &quot;Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc&quot;, thus retaining the EMD initials. EMD&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary was renamed &quot;Electro-Motive Canada&quot;. In 2010 EMD and its Canadian subsidiary were acquired by Caterpillar&#x27;s subsidiary Progress Rail.

===The end===
The plant was closed in 2012, after a labor dispute and leasing of a new plant in Muncie, Indiana.

In 2015 McLaughlin Brothers and J-AAR Excavating jointly acquire the plant facility. HCL Logistics moved into the plant space after consolidating their London operations and is partner with General Dynamics Land Systems in the same site.

<doc id="1147421" wikidata="Q1677377" url="?curid=1147421" title="Funeral march">
<text>A funeral march (&#x27; in French,&#x27; in Italian, &#x27; in German,&#x27; in Polish), as a musical genre, is a march, usually in a minor key, in a slow &quot;simple duple&quot; metre, imitating the solemn pace of a funeral procession. Some such marches are often considered appropriate for use during funerals and other sombre occasions, the best-known example being the third movement of Chopin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 2. Handel uses the name dead march, also used for marches played by a military band at military funerals.

== History ==

=== Historical origins ===
The custom of accompanying the solemn funeral procession with instrumental music was already present in ancient civilizations in various forms. Both the Greeks and the Etruscans usually employed flute players or, the latter, zither players, as can be deduced for example from the &quot;Chiusi cippi&quot; illustrated in Pericle Ducati&#x27;s work.  Among the Romans, the traditional funeral (&quot;funus translaticium&quot;) involved the presence of musicians at the opening of the procession: two &quot;cornicini&quot;, four &quot;tibicini&quot; and a &quot;lituus&quot;, a special trumpet with a soft sound that was well suited to the circumstances. There is sculptural evidence of this ritual in a funerary bas-relief from &quot;Amiternum&quot;. 

=== 17th century ===
The genesis of the funeral march dates back to the seventeenth century. Originally it belongs to the group of solemn processional marches, military and non-military,  and was intended only for practical use in the funerals of illustrious figures.  However, already in 1674 Jean-Baptiste Lully used his &quot;Pompe funèbre&quot; in his opera &quot;Alceste&quot;. 

Other ancient funeral marches, however intended for their own use, are the marches taken from Purcell &#x27;s &quot;Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary&quot; (1694), composed for the funeral of Mary II of England (5 March 1695),  and the &quot;March to the Dauphin&#x27;s Funeral Home&quot; written for Maria Anna of Bavaria and attributed to Philidor the Elder around 1690. 

=== 18th century ===
The eighteenth century was relatively scarce with funeral marches, both in military repertoires and in the works of great composers, but it still produced notable examples and, above all, freed the genre from its ceremonial function.

If in the early years of the century Philidor still composed a &quot;Marche funèbre pour le convoi du Roy&quot; (1715) for the solemn funeral of Louis XIV,  twenty years later we remember the &quot;Dead marches&quot; written by Handel for the &quot;Saul&quot; oratorios (1738) and &quot;Samson&quot; (1742). The first is identified in England with the funeral march par excellence and remained in use in funerals until the twentieth century. 

The rituals of Freemasonry contributed to the development of the genre at the end of the century. An early example is Giroust &#x27;s cantata &quot;Le déluge&quot; (1784), composed to commemorate a free-mason of the Paris lodge. Even Mozart &#x27;s &quot;Maurerische Trauermusik&quot; (1785), an original composition that combines the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; with a march and presents various characteristics similar to those of the funeral march,  is dedicated to the memory of two Freemasons. This famous &quot;Trauermusik&quot; is preceded by a &quot;Kleiner Trauermarsch&quot; (1784) which seems to anticipate its content. 

The French Revolution replaced the Requiem Mass with the funeral procession with its triumph being the procession to the Pantheon as for Rouseau in 1994, in what used to be the Roman Catholic church of Sainte-Genevieve in Paris.  It is at this moment that the funeral march established itself to the detriment of the &quot;requiem&quot; as a secular model of funeral music,  intended as much for witnesses of civil virtue as for military heroes.  Civil celebrations become an essential moment of the new religion of reason, inspiring hymns and other compositions suitable for various occasions, including funerals. 

The lacerating &quot;Lugubrious March&quot; composed by Francois-Joseph Gossec to celebrate the victims of an anti-royalist uprising on 20 September 1790 known as the Nancy affair which marked a decisive turning point. Performed on the Champ de Mars in memory of the fallen soldiers, it aroused great emotion and sets the &quot;standard&quot; for the nineteenth-century funeral march.  The piece was repeated at Mirabeau &#x27;s solemn funeral on 4 April 1791. On this occasion, the use of the large drum was particularly striking, appearing for the first time in a musical composition and marking the procession with a sense of fatality.  The Italians Cherubini and Paisiello also composed funeral marches for the death of General Hoche in 1797 after he had spilled a lot of blood during the Revolution. 

=== 19th century ===
==== Beethoven and the heroic funeral march ====
Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; funeral march is one of the first great concert pieces of its kind.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Beethoven adhered to the ideals of the Revolution and borrowed the theme of heroic death from the composers of the revolutionary era,  from which he drew inspiration in several works destined to reverberate their influence on the work of romantic. The &quot;Funeral March on the Death of a Hero&quot; (1800-1801) which is the third movement of the &quot;Piano Sonata no. 12&quot;, one of the most popular of the century,  would have a notable influence on Chopin in particular. 

Beethoven was looking for the &quot;new musical paths&quot; (&quot;Neue Bahnen)&quot; mentioned in one of his letters to Krumpholz of 1802.  In this period the maestro from Bonn frequented the funeral march genre several times: for example, the fifth of the &quot;Six Variations in F major for piano&quot; op. 34 (1799). 

But what is of greatest importance is the second movement of the &quot;Eroica&quot; (1802-1804) which, in addition to innovating the very way of conceiving the central slow tempo of the symphony form, definitively frees the funeral march from functionality to practical use, drawing from it a pure concert piece.  The funeral march of the &quot;Eroica&quot; was not very suitable for use in processions,  unlike that of the Sonata n. 12, which remains the only movement of his own sonata orchestrated by Beethoven and which was performed at the composer&#x27;s funeral on 29 March 1827. 

However, alongside the Beethovenian epic genre, different other tendencies emerge. The funeral march that opens the finale of the second act in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Gazza ladra&quot; (1819) (&quot;Infelice, unfortunate&quot;) is renowned throughout the nineteenth century and heralds a new turning point in the evolution of the genre, introducing a previously unknown melodic lyricism.  The fifth of Schubert &#x27;s &quot;Six grandes marches en trio&quot; (1824) is in the same vein though it is not indicated by the author as a funeral march but so called in his obituaries and in a piano transcription by Liszt. 

In terms of instrumentation, after the first decades of the century the orchestral workforce expanded. Percussions other than timpani, which had so much weight in band performances at the time of the Revolution, also made their debut in the orchestra: in the 1840s, those percussions were fully integrated in the compositions of Berlioz, Donizetti, Wagner. 

Romanticism, fascinated by funeral music, further deepened the significance of the composition,  using it in chamber music, in the symphony, in the sonata, in opera. At the same time, however, a vast literature of compositions for wind orchestra conceived as tribute and performed at funerals also flourished.

==== Chopin and the romantic funeral march ====

The attraction for funeral music was especially intense for Chopin, who knew well the &quot;Sonata No. 12&quot; by Beethoven; as a matter of fact, he usually exploited its elements in other compositions. Many examples are certainly familiar to him when he sets out to compose the famous piece around which he would build the entire &quot;Sonata No. 2&quot; Op. 35 (1839). In addition to the works of Beethoven and Rossini, the Polish composer almost certainly knew the first movement of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Great Funeral and Triumphal Symphony&quot; before its official debut in 1840,  but it possesses a very different character and in all likelihood represents a model negative. 

The funeral marches were performed only an official function, it had almost no theme, the melody was chaste and sinister, the whole structure was oriented towards the solemn celebration. In Chopin&#x27;s funeral march, the central section in a major mode trio presents a theme that is not only complete, but that can be counted among the melodic peaks reached by the author in all of his production. 

In Chopin the funeral march abdicates public solemnity to include a moment of private meditation.  Compared to Beethoven, the heroic and glorious dimension has been completely lost: the Chopin trio rather expresses a defeat, for some a prayer, for others only profound sadness, in a humanization of death which has certainly contributed to the popularity of the song.  It is a difficult passage to interpret, not surprisingly criticized and even repudiated as &quot;abominable&quot; by Bülow, or instead considered a &quot;touchstone&quot; of the pianist &#x27;s sensitivity such as Wilhelm von Lenz. 

At Chopin&#x27;s funeral on 30 October 1849, the piece was performed in an orchestral transcription, entrusted to Reber with Meyerbeer&#x27;s regret. It is just one of the countless transcriptions for band or orchestra that have contributed to extending the composition&#x27;s fame. 

Throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century Chopin&#x27;s funeral march has been the best-known in the world, and also the most famous of Chopin&#x27;s works.  It was orchestrated among others by Elgar (who transposes it from B♭ to D minor) and by Stokowski, and is often performed at state funerals, for example those of John F. Kennedy (25 November 1963), Sir Winston Churchill (30 January 1965), Leonid Brezhnev (15 November 1982), Margaret, Baroness Thatcher (17 April 2013), and Elizabeth II (19 September 2022).  John Philip Sousa testifies that in Australia in 1910 his transcription for band thrilled the audience to the point that it was necessary to repeat it at the next concert.

==== Liszt and the romantic funeral march ====
The fascination with death then emerged from Liszt &#x27;s theme and also took on a personal dimension in the &quot;Three Funeral Odes&quot;, including &quot;The Night&quot; (1863-1864), a funeral march dedicated to the memory of his daughter Blandine.  Liszt in turn referred to Beethoven, whose funeral march from the &quot;Eroica&quot; he transcribed for the piano. 

The characteristics of the funeral march are found in various symphonic poems such as &quot;Tasso&quot; (1854), &quot;Die Ideale&quot; (1857), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1858), &quot;Héroïde funèbre&quot; (1849-1850), &quot;Hungaria&quot; (1854), where the Hungarian composer deals with both death and mourning itself, and death as a prelude to rebirth.  In the last two poems cited the reference to the funeral march is explicit in the time indication .

Liszt&#x27;s funeral marches or pseudomarches are characterized by their extreme slowness.  Liszt relies particularly on dark timbres and low registers, providing expressive indications such as &quot;expressive dolente&quot;, &quot;feeble&quot;, &quot;lachrymoso&quot;, &quot;lamentative&quot;, &quot;lugubrious&quot;, &quot;crying&quot;. In some cases &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Hungaria&quot;) the one to the funeral march is a simple allusion conveyed by a theme in march time, while in others the composition receives a complete form and includes a trio.  Another passage from the &quot;Years of Pilgrimage&quot; (1867) is dedicated to Maximilian I of Mexico, the emperor of the house of Habsburg executed by the republican troops of Benito Juarez. 

==== Mahler and the symphonic funeral march ====
Towards the end of the century, the funeral march played an important symbolic role in Gustav Mahler&#x27;s production, starting with the romance &quot;Die zwei blauen Augen&quot; (1884) taken from the &quot;Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen&quot;. The composer uses it indifferently in the symphonies (third movement of the first and first of the fifth), in the &quot;Lieder&quot; and in the collections of the latter. 

In the second volume of the collection &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;, which had a great influence on the first four symphonies and which stood out for the extreme nature of the emotions addressed,  the echo of &quot;Die zwei blauen Augen&quot; stands out, melodically recalled by &quot;Nicht wiedersehen!&quot; (1888-1891). 

The 1884 romance also returned in the most famous funeral march of the first symphony (1888-1894), in a mix of quotes that alludes to the author&#x27;s autobiographical experience.  The fundamental quote is a gloomy parody of the &quot;Fra Martino&quot; canon, a childish song to which Mahler has always attributed a sense of tragedy, which obsesses him all the time just as he is looking for an &quot;incipit&quot; and which, finally accepted into the symphony, sustains a sarcastic and sinister atmosphere. 

Both the funeral march of the first symphony and that of the fifth are inspired by Mendelssohn &#x27;s model. The first finds its precedent in the parodic funeral march of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1843), a short-lived piece which in turn hints at &quot;Fra Martino&quot; &#x27;s theme and furthermore retains the typical trait of dotted rhythm.  The second openly quotes the &quot;incipit&quot; of the &quot;Romanza senza parole&quot; op. 62 n. 3 (1842-1844). 

==== The revival of Lenten funeral marches ====
From the military and royal funeral marches, the religious funeral marches developed since the 17th century. It evolved as a more specific genre in the 19th century with this repertoire being formed over the course of several decades. In the archives of the &quot;Hermandad de la Amargura&quot; (Brotherhood of Bitterness) of Seville, there is evidence of the Lenten funeral marches with the formation of the musical band known as the Banda del Asilo de San Fernando and today as the Municipal Symphonic Band of Seville through the artistic activity of Andrés Palatín Palma, who provided musical services for Holy Week since April 14, 1838.

In Italy, the earliest record of a special repertoire for those bands dates from 1857, the year in which Vincenzo Valente (1830-1908) composed &quot;U Conzasiegge&quot;, the oldest Molfetta Funeral March known today. It was another man with links to the Puglia, Vincenzo Alemanno, active as an organist in the 19th century in the main churches of Gallipoli who canonized the genre. A composition taken from his Requiem Mass and composed for the Solemn Funeral of Pope Pius IX, celebrated in the Cathedral Church of Sant&#x27;Agata, Saturday 16 March 1878 when Alemanno was organist at the same time at the Cathedral of Sant&#x27;Agata, the Chiesa del Carmine and the Chiesa delle Anime.

The genre crossed into Latin America, and became particular in many countries. They often followed a similar trajectory, from military to religious, to classical marches. The oldest Latin American funeral march known is the &quot;Marcha Morán,&quot; a Peruvian funeral march that tradition claims was composed in Arequipa in homage to General Trinidad Morán, shot in 1854. Since the 1870s, this melody has accompanied the journey of the Virgin of Sorrows, one of the most revered Catholic images of Arequipa, whose procession takes place every Good Friday of Holy Week, from the church of Santo Domingo. In Guatemala Lenten funeral marches have become a national treasure. &quot;La Fosa&quot;, by Santiago Coronado, is one of the first documented guatemaltec funeral marches, dating from 1888. Among the pioneers of the genre are also Salvador Iriarte, author of &quot;Jesús de la Merced&quot;, and Marcial Prem, creator of &quot;Funeral March n.3&quot;. 

=== 20th century ===
After a golden age of funeral marches in the nineteenth century, the musical genre also thrived in the twentieth century: examples can be found among others in Britten, Kodály or Sibelius.  There are various rearrangements of older masterpieces and especially of Chopin&#x27;s funeral march. Saint-Saëns drew from it, for example, an arrangement for two pianos (1907),  while Satie in his &quot;Embryons desséchés&quot; (1913) joked about it with a series of trivializing melodic and harmonic devices. 

==== Shostakovich and the Russian funeral march ====
In particular, the funeral marches stand out in the production of Shostakovich, whose entire work is permeated by death, of which he is a constant witness in the collective tragedies of Russian history of the 20th century. The composer made his debut in the genre at the age of eleven with a piano piece dedicated to the fallen of the October Revolution (1917), transcribed a work by Schubert (1920) and then left numerous other examples, including the adagio &quot;In memoriam&quot; of the &quot;Symphony no. 15&quot; (1957). 

The obsessive theme of death deepens and is placed in special relief in his late production.  Heartbreaking given the circumstances of his composition is the funeral march included in &quot;String Quartet No. 15&quot; (1974), completed in hospital and entirely permeated by the idea of death, in «a disconsolate and tragic farewell to life» of the author now at the end of his existence. 

==== Epic Lenten marches ====
In many places until the 20th century, the processions of Holy Week did not tolerate bands as instruments were banned from liturgy during Len, there these processions were made in silence as it is still the case in many places, such as in the Procession of Silence in San Luis Potosi. However, with the continuous attraction of crowds, bands have been helpful to cover the noise and keep a pious atmosphere around the solemn moments. Thus, during Holy Week in Leon in 1959, a great novelty occurs: for the first time, a band of bugles and drums belonging entirely to a brotherhood and parades in a tunic accompanying the images of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of Our Lord. 

The composition of the funeral march &quot;La Madrugá&quot; on Holy Tuesday 1987, April 14, marks a before and after processional music for the specific genre of Lenten funeral marches.It has since been performed in all the concert programs of Holy Week in Seville. Likewise, the Music Bands incorporate it into their processional routes, spreading it throughout Andalusia. With Abel Moreno moved to Madrid, its nationwide dissemination became unstoppable, becoming a reference not only for Spanish Holy Week, but for the entire world. The mutual enrichment and recognition between classical and popular &quot;band&quot; funeral marches was reached with this composition which go &quot;in crescendo&quot; until the explosion of the final &quot;tutti,&quot; allowing it to share programs with the &quot;Passion&quot; Symphony by J. Haydn and the &quot;Requiem&quot; by W. A. Mozart. 

In Guatemala, it was not until 1988 that the procession known as the “Penitential Procession of the First Thursday of Lent” in Guatemala, has incorporated the presence of a musical band with the authorization of archbishop Monsignor Barrios Sánchez. The official marches that are performed are “Ramito de Olivo”, “King of the Universe” and “Jesús de San José”.

== Analysis ==

=== Form ===
The original structure of the funeral march repeats that of the Lullian military march in two repetitions of eight measures each. Subsequently, the genre evolved towards the form of the march with a ternary structure. The modern military march provides a ternary structure: the march itself is followed by a trio at the end of which the march starts again from the beginning. This pattern or a variant of it is usually used in the funeral march.

However, while other types of marches do not differ essentially from the ordinary model, the funeral march has characteristics that instantly distinguish it from other compositions. Mendelssohn, who for the fifth volume of his&quot;Songs without Words&quot; composed a piece which overall did not correspond to the form of the funeral march, had his publishers title it &quot;Trauermarsch&quot; simply because of the characteristics of the first bars. The &quot;Lied&quot; was then instrumented by Moscheles and performed at Mendelssohn&#x27;s funeral (7 November 1847).

=== Tempo and meter ===
Funeral marches are typically solemn marches, very slow in &quot;tempo&quot; (&quot;lento&quot; and &quot;adagio&quot; and similar tempos), in binary or quaternary measures of sad and regular progress. The time signature can be generic or specified by the composer via a metronome signature. In all cases there are several possible interpretations of the funeral march time. In fact, if the metronome is indicated, the speed of execution can vary from 44-48 bpm for Liszt&#x27;s funeral marches to 92 of that contained in Symphony no. 1 of Ries. Beethoven himself indicates a tempo of 80 bpm to the quaver for the &quot;Eroica&quot; funeral march, although it is normally played slower. It is possible that the influences of national military traditions weighed on the choice of composers: the Austrian one, for example, prescribed the more pressing pace typical of the marches of the grenadiers and riflemen.

The military manuals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries do not expressly set the funeral march &quot;tempo&quot;, but suggest that it is at most that of the ordinary pace, and if possible slower. This is provided in particular by the regulations of the New York State Militia (1858), which allowed the ordinary step only when the distance to the place of burial was considerable (article 319). The modern military standard tends to halve the common march time and perform the funeral march at 60 bpm. However, the funeral pace is the slowest of the marching steps and is therefore located at the extreme limit opposite to the quickstep time.

=== Rhythm ===
The typical rhythm of the funeral march is dotted. The note following that episode normally lasts a quarter of the movement to which it belongs, but in some compositions it is reduced to an eighth (as in the second movement of the &quot;Eroica&quot; and in Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March in memory of Rikard Nordraak&quot; (1866), where short notes are dusk notes). Czerny codified the rhythm of solemn, parade and funeral marches in the following two ways:&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\relative d { \clef bass \tempo 4=60 \key d \minor &lt;d f a&gt;4 &lt;d f a&gt;8. &lt;d f a&gt;16 &lt;d f a&gt;4 &lt;d f a&gt;4 }&lt;/score&gt;https://upload.wikimedia.org/score/e/y/ey2k22xfz1i0wa9kojxoilisr0cjp56/ey2k22xf.png&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\relative d { \clef bass \tempo 4=60 \key d \minor &lt;d f a&gt;4. &lt;d f a&gt;16 &lt;d f a&gt;16 &lt;d f a&gt;4 &lt;d f a&gt;4 }&lt;/score&gt;

=== Mode ===
The funeral marches are mostly written in the minor mode, but the rule suffers from illustrious exceptions: for example, Handel&#x27;s funeral marches are in the major mode. The melodic line is short and dark, and often resorts to the repetition of notes. An ascending minor third interval can characterize the main theme.

In the form established in the 19th century, the piece includes a trio in a major mode, often written in the parallel key, in the relative key, or in that of the subdominant of the latter. This section can represent a pitiful episode, or a consolatory one, or a heroic one, or at times (as in the specific case of Chopin&#x27;s masterpiece) of complex interpretation, or it may want to sublimate death into a positive mystery.

=== Instruments ===

Funeral marches are usually performed by wind ensembles, which allow greater sound power in open spaces, as required by funeral ceremonies and processions.The reasons for the predilection for aerophones, however, are not merely practical, but also symbolic: in this sense, they derive from the biblical association between death and wind instruments such as the flute and the trumpet.

The use of drums (possibly muted), of military origin, is also normal. When, at the beginning of the 19th century, the use of these instruments in the orchestra was not common, the composer made up for it with strings in the low registers: they simulate percussion by exploiting the ear&#x27;s difficulty in recognizing the pitch of low sounds, which seem almost indeterminate. Even the piano, as a struck string instrument, can easily imitate the drum.

Idiophones are prized for their ability to reproduce the sound of death knells.

== Genres ==

=== Funeral music ===
In terms of content, the funeral march belongs to the more generic funeral music, which includes expressive forms other than the march, some of which are entrusted to singing. Another of these forms is the requiem, which falls within the context of liturgical music.[64] In the United States, the contamination of the European and African traditions of the military band and the spiritual has given rise to the tradition of the jazz funeral, typical of New Orleans, in which a brass band accompanies the funeral with hymns and funeral songs in marching time.

=== Lenten and Holy Week processions ===

Funeral marches found their most common and regular expression in the Passiontide processions of the Spanish and Italian religious tradition which were propagated to Latin America especially Peru and Guatemala and all of Christianity. In southern Italy, popular funeral marches are still enormous successful, and musical bands perform entire repertoires of them in the long demonstrations of Holy Week.

=== Parody ===

The unmistakability of its characteristics and the possibility of exploiting its stereotypes makes the funeral march a genre that lends itself well to parodic and joking use, to the point of the grotesque.

In addition to Mahler&#x27;s first symphony, where the parody takes on a ghostly tone, we find a famous example in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March for a Marionette&quot; (1872), which became famous in the 1950s and 1960s as the theme song for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s television series. Charles-Valentin Alkan&#x27;s &quot;Funeral March on the Death of a Parrot&quot; (1858), a surreal composition for wind instruments and choir is another classic of the genre: it mocks the funeral marches of Rossini, Gossec and Beethoven.The joking Italian title of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Kleiner Trauermarsch&quot; has led to suspicions of a self-parody of his &quot;Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 16&quot;, but the opinion is not sufficiently shared.

The French humorist Alphonse Allais &quot;wrote&quot; a &quot;Marche funèbre composée pour les funérailles d&#x27;un grand homme sourd&quot;, a completely blank score bearing the time signature &quot;Lento rigolando&quot; (inspired by the colloquial verb &quot;rigoler&quot;, &quot;to joke&quot;).

=== Funeral marches in movies ===
When they play funeral marchs, film soundtracks often draw on the classical repertoire (with a clear prevalence of the two famous works by Chopin and Gounod), but sometimes they also use original pieces. Among the non-original funeral marches of popular tradition, &quot;Christ at the Column&quot; by Giuseppe Bellisario, used by Giuseppe Tornatore in the film &quot;The Star Man&quot;, stood out. The following examples are original.

* Marcia funebre by Darius Milhaud in &quot;Espoir&quot; (1945)
* Marcia funebre by Carlo Rustichelli in &quot;Divorzio all&#x27;italiana&quot; (1961)
* Marcia funebre Zbigniew Preisner in &quot;Tre colori - Film blu&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Prima e dopo&quot; by Ennio Morricone in &quot;Baarìa&quot; (2009)

<text>Wobbegong is the common name given to the 12 species of carpet sharks in the family Orectolobidae. They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean, chiefly around Australia and Indonesia, although one species (the Japanese wobbegong, &quot;Orectolobus japonicus&quot;) occurs as far north as Japan. The word &quot;wobbegong&quot; is believed to come from an Australian Aboriginal language, meaning &quot;shaggy beard&quot;, referring to the growths around the mouth of the shark of the western Pacific.

==Description==

Wobbegongs are bottom-dwelling sharks, spending much of their time resting on the sea floor. Most species have a maximum length of , but the largest, the spotted wobbegong, &quot;Orectolobus maculatus&quot;, and banded wobbegong, &quot;O. halei&quot;, reach about in length.

Wobbegongs are well camouflaged with a symmetrical pattern of bold markings which resembles a carpet. Because of this striking pattern, wobbegongs and their close relatives are often referred to as carpet sharks. The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes surrounding the wobbegong&#x27;s jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. Wobbegongs make use of their camouflage to hide among rocks and catch smaller fish which swim too close, typical of ambush predators. Wobbegongs also have a powerful jaw with needle-like teeth that assist in catching reef fish and other sharks for food. The blood cells of several species of wobbegong have also been described.

==Interaction with humans==

Wobbegongs are generally not considered dangerous to humans, but have attacked swimmers, snorkelers, and scuba divers who inadvertently come close to them. The Australian Shark Attack File contains more than 50 records of unprovoked attacks by wobbegongs, and the International Shark Attack File 31 records, none of them fatal. Wobbegongs have also bitten surfers. Wobbegongs are very flexible and can easily bite a hand holding onto their tail. They have many small but sharp teeth and their bite can be severe, even through a wetsuit; having once bitten, they have been known to hang on and can be very difficult to remove.

In Australia, wobbegong skin is used to make leather.

===Captivity===

Although most wobbegong species are unsuitable for home aquaria due to their large adult size, this has not stopped some of the larger species from being sold in the aquarium trade. Small wobbegong species, such as the tasselled wobbegong and Ward&#x27;s wobbegong, are &quot;ideal&quot; sharks for home aquarists to keep because they are an appropriate size and are lethargic, enabling them to be accommodated within the limited space of a home tank, although they will consume tankmates, even quite large ones. Some aquarists, by contrast, see the lack of activity to be a drawback to keeping wobbegongs, and prefer more active sharks. Wobbegongs are largely nocturnal and, due to their slow metabolism, do not have to be fed as often as other sharks. Most do well on two feedings weekly. Underfed wobbegongs can be recognised by visibly atrophied dorsal musculature.

==Genera and species==
The 12 living species of wobbegong, in three genera, are:
* Genus &quot;Eucrossorhinus&quot; 
**&quot;Eucrossorhinus dasypogon&quot; (tasselled wobbegong)
* Genus &quot;Orectolobus&quot;

** &quot;Orectolobus halei&quot; . (Gulf wobbegong or banded wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus hutchinsi&quot; . (western wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus japonicus&quot; (Japanese wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus leptolineatus&quot; (Indonesian wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus maculatus&quot; (spotted wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus ornatus&quot; (ornate wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus parvimaculatus&quot; (dwarf spotted wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus reticulatus&quot; (network wobbegong)
** &quot;Orectolobus wardi&quot; (northern wobbegong)
* Genus &quot;Sutorectus&quot;

<text>A table is an item of furniture with a raised flat top and is supported most commonly by 1 to 4 legs (although some can have more). It is used as a surface for working at, eating from or on which to place things. Some common types of tables are the dining room tables, which are used for seated persons to eat meals; the coffee table, which is a low table used in living rooms to display items or serve refreshments; and the bedside table, which is commonly used to place an alarm clock and a lamp. There are also a range of specialized types of tables, such as drafting tables, used for doing architectural drawings, and sewing tables.

Common design elements include: 
* Top surfaces of various shapes, including rectangular, square, rounded, semi-circular or oval
* Legs arranged in two or more similar pairs. It usually has four legs. However, some tables have three legs, use a single heavy pedestal, or are attached to a wall.
* Several geometries of folding table that can be collapsed into a smaller volume (e.g., a TV tray, which is a portable, folding table on a stand)
* Heights ranging up and down from the most common range, often reflecting the height of chairs or bar stools used as seating for people making use of a table, as for eating or performing various manipulations of objects resting on a table
* A huge range of sizes, from small bedside tables to large dining room tables and huge conference room tables
* Presence or absence of drawers, shelves or other areas for storing items
* Expansion of the table surface by insertion of &quot;leaves&quot; or locking hinged &quot;drop leaf&quot; sections into a horizontal position (this is particularly common for dining tables)

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; is derived from Old English , derived from the Latin word (&#x27;a board, plank, flat top piece&#x27;), which replaced the Old English ; its current spelling reflects the influence of the French .

==History==
Some very early tables were made and used by the Ancient Egyptians around 2500 BC, using wood and alabaster. They were often little more than stone platforms used to keep objects off the floor, though a few examples of wooden tables have been found in tombs. Food and drinks were usually put on large plates deposed on a pedestal for eating. The Egyptians made use of various small tables and elevated playing boards. The Chinese also created very early tables in order to pursue the arts of writing and painting, as did people in Mesopotamia, where various metals were used.

The Greeks and Romans made more frequent use of tables, notably for eating, although Greek tables were pushed under a bed after use. The Greeks invented a piece of furniture very similar to the guéridon. Tables were made of marble or wood and metal (typically bronze or silver alloys), sometimes with richly ornate legs. Later, the larger rectangular tables were made of separate platforms and pillars. The Romans also introduced a large, semicircular table to Italy, the &quot;mensa lunata&quot;. Plutarch mentions use of &quot;tables&quot; by Persians.

Furniture during the Middle Ages is not as well known as that of earlier or later periods, and most sources show the types used by the nobility. In the Eastern Roman Empire, tables were made of metal or wood, usually with four feet and frequently linked by x-shaped stretchers. Tables for eating were large and often round or semicircular. A combination of a small round table and a lectern seemed very popular as a writing table. 
In western Europe, although there was variety of form — the circular, semicircular, oval and oblong were all in use — tables appear to have been portable and supported upon trestles fixed or folding, which were cleared out of the way at the end of a meal. Thus Charlemagne possessed three tables of silver and one of gold, probably made of wood and covered with plates of the precious metals. The custom of serving dinner at several small tables, which is often supposed to be a modern refinement, was followed in the French châteaux, and probably also in the English castles, as early as the 13th century.

Refectory tables first appeared at least as early as the 17th century, as an advancement of the trestle table; these tables were typically quite long and wide and capable of supporting a sizeable banquet in the great hall or other reception room of a castle.

==Shape, height, and function==
Tables come in a wide variety of materials, shapes, and heights dependent upon their origin, style, intended use and cost. Many tables are made of wood or wood-based products; some are made of other materials including metal and glass. Most tables are composed of a flat surface and one or more supports (legs). A table with a single, central foot is a pedestal table. Long tables often have extra legs for support.

Table tops can be in virtually any shape, although rectangular, square, round (e.g. the round table), and oval tops are the most frequent. Others have higher surfaces for personal use while either standing or sitting on a tall stool.

Many tables have tops that can be adjusted to change their height, position, shape, or size, either with foldable, sliding or extensions parts that can alter the shape of the top. Some tables are entirely foldable for easy transportation, e.g. camping or storage, e.g., TV trays. Small tables in trains and aircraft may be fixed or foldable, although they are sometimes considered as simply convenient shelves rather than tables.

Tables can be freestanding or designed for placement against a wall. Tables designed to be placed against a wall are known as pier tables or s (, &quot;support bracket&quot;) and may be bracket-mounted (traditionally), like a shelf, or have legs, which sometimes imitate the look of a bracket-mounted table.

==Types==

Tables of various shapes, heights, and sizes are designed for specific uses:
*Dining room tables are designed to be used for formal dining.
*Bedside tables, nightstands, or night tables are small tables used in a bedroom. They are often used for convenient placement of a small lamp, alarm clock, glasses, or other personal items.
*Drop-leaf tables have a fixed section in the middle and a hinged section (leaf) on either side that can be folded down.
*Gateleg tables have one or two hinged leaves supported by hinged legs.
*Coffee tables are low tables designed for use in a living room, in front of a sofa, for convenient placement of drinks, books, or other personal items.
*Refectory tables are long tables designed to seat many people for meals.
*Drafting tables usually have a top that can be tilted for making a large or technical drawing. They may also have a ruler or similar element integrated.
*Workbenches are sturdy tables, often elevated for use with a high stool or while standing, which are used for assembly, repairs, or other precision handwork.
*Nested tables are a set of small tables of graduated size that can be stacked together, each fitting within the one immediately larger. They are for occasional use (such as a tea party), hence the stackable design.

==Specialized types==
Historically, various types of tables have become popular for specific uses:
*Loo tables were very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries as candlestands, tea tables, or small dining tables, although they were originally made for the popular card game loo or lanterloo. Their typically round or oval tops have a tilting mechanism, which enables them to be stored out of the way (e.g. in room corners) when not in use. A further development in this direction was the &quot;birdcage&quot; table, the top of which could both revolve and tilt.
*Pembroke tables, first introduced during the 18th century, were popular throughout the 19th century. Their main characteristic was a rectangular or oval top with folding or drop leaves on each side. Most examples have one or more drawers and four legs, sometimes connected by stretchers. Their design meant they could easily be stored or moved about and conveniently opened for serving tea, dining, writing, or other occasional uses. One account attributes the design of the Pembroke table to Henry Herbert, 9th Earl of Pembroke (1693-1751).

*Sofa tables are similar to Pembroke tables and usually have longer and narrower tops. They were specifically designed for placement directly in front of sofas for serving tea, writing, dining, or other convenient uses. Generally speaking, a sofa table is a tall, narrow table used behind a sofa to hold lamps or decorative objects.
*Work tables were small tables designed to hold sewing materials and implements, providing a convenient work place for women who sewed. They appeared during the 18th century and were popular throughout the 19th century. Most examples have rectangular tops, sometimes with folding leaves, and usually one or more drawers fitted with partitions. Early examples typically have four legs, often standing on casters, while later examples sometimes have turned columns or other forms of support.
*Drum tables are round tables introduced for writing, with drawers around the platform.
*End tables are small tables typically placed beside couches or armchairs. Often lamps will be placed on an end table.
*Overbed tables are narrow rectangular tables whose top is designed for use above the bed, especially for hospital patients.
*Billiards tables are bounded tables on which billiards-type games are played. All provide a flat surface, usually composed of slate and covered with cloth, elevated above the ground.
*Chess tables are a type of games table that integrates a chessboard.
*Table tennis tables are usually masonite or a similar wood, layered with a smooth low-friction coating. they are divided into two halves by a low net, which separates opposing players.
*Poker tables or card tables are used to play poker or other card games.

==Provincial parks==

There are three provincially owned parks in the City of Toronto.

Parks that are owned by the Government of Ontario include:

* Ontario Place — artificially constructed former amusement park and entertainment and event facility on the waterfront south of Exhibition Place and is being redeveloped; includes Budweiser Stage
* Queen&#x27;s Park — park setting on the south and north ends of the Ontario Legislative Building. The southern portion of the park is owned by the provincial government, while the northern portion of the park is owned by the University of Toronto and leased to the municipal government for 999 years; not to be confused with Queen&#x27;s Greenbelt in North York
* Trillium Park — artificially constructed park with a natural-looking landscape planted with native tree and shrub species; built on the site of a former Ontario Place parking lot

==Federal parks==

There are three federally owned parks in the City of Toronto, including one national park managed by Parks Canada, a federal agency of the Government of Canada.

Parks owned by the federal government include:

* Downsview Park — converted military base CFB Downsview / Downsview Airport in North York
* Harbourfront Park — waterfront promenade and urban park amongst residential and commercial development along Queens Quay West in downtown Toronto
* Rouge National Urban Park — a national urban park and nature preserve centred around the Rouge Valley with some agricultural uses and extends to Markham

==Toronto and Region Conservation Authority==
The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) (an agency of the provincial government) is one of 36 conservation authorities in Ontario, Canada with a jurisdiction covering over nine different watersheds. The TRCA operates many conservation areas in the Toronto region, including three completely or primarily within the City of Toronto limits:
* The Village at Black Creek (formerly Black Creek Pioneer Village) primarily in North York with a very small section in Vaughan
* Tommy Thompson Park (Leslie Street Spit) on the Toronto waterfront
* Humber Bay Shores Waterfront Park — a park linking City-owned Palace Pier Park and Humber Bay Park East on the south side of Marine Parade Drive to Park Lawn Road in Etobicoke

TRCA briefly managed part of Rouge Park before it was transferred to Parks Canada.

<text>Wanda LaVonne Jackson (born October 20, 1937) is an American retired singer and songwriter. Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of rock, country and gospel. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the nickname &quot;The Queen of Rockabilly&quot;. She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.

Jackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer Hank Thompson, who helped her secure a recording contract with Decca Records in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Have My Love&quot;. She then began touring the following year with Elvis Presley. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the rockabilly style. In 1956, Jackson signed with Capitol Records where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson&#x27;s rock singles, including &quot;Fujiyama Mama&quot;, &quot;Mean Mean Man&quot; and the top 40 hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot;.

In the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included &quot;Right or Wrong&quot;, &quot;In the Middle of a Heartache&quot;, &quot;Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine&quot; and &quot;A Woman Lives for Love&quot;. In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering Christianity in 1971, Jackson made gospel music a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with Word Records to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.

In 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist Rosie Flores. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including &quot;Heart Trouble&quot; (2003) and &quot;I Remember Elvis&quot; (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jackson collaborated with musician Jack White to record the commercially successful &quot;The Party Ain&#x27;t Over&quot;. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, &quot;Encore&quot;, in 2021.

==Early life==
Jackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in Maud, Oklahoma. Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver. He also played music in a local band alongside his brother. Because of limited opportunities in Maud, the family moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1941. Jackson often sang alongside her parents at home. Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for. In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to western swing music. She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like Bob Wills and Rose Maddox. At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.

In the mid 1940s, the family relocated to Bakersfield, California where Tom Jackson took a job as a barber. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar. It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: &quot;All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still,&quot; she recounted in her autobiography. When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in Oklahoma City. Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.

In Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities. She auditioned for the local radio station, KLPR, after being peer-pressured by friends. She was featured on program, which impressed the station&#x27;s disc jockey, who encouraged her to audition for a second KLPR contest. Jackson won the second contest at KLPR, which allotted Jackson her own 15-minute radio segment. On the show, Jackson performed a set of country songs and recalled having little understanding of how to host a radio show. &quot;I was flying by the seat of my pants, but it didn&#x27;t scare me to get out on a limb and try something brand new. I liked it,&quot; she explained in her biography.

As a teenager, Jackson attended Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City and continued her radio show. She also dated fellow student, Leonard Sipes, who would later go by the name Tommy Collins. In 1952, Jackson was heard on the air by country singer and local resident, Hank Thompson. The singer invited Jackson to perform with him at the Trianon Ballroom in Oklahoma City. On Thompson&#x27;s show, Jackson sang &quot;Blue Yodel No. 6&quot; backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside Merl Lindsay&#x27;s country band. Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. &quot;[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar – that&#x27;s all she thought about,&quot; a high school friend recalled.

==Career==
===1953–1955: Country beginnings===
Jackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KLPR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets. Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson&#x27;s label, Capitol Records, but was rejected by producer Ken Nelson. &quot;Girls don&#x27;t sell records!&quot; he told Thompson. In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson&#x27;s statement: &quot;I recognize that Ken wasn&#x27;t being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!&quot;
Instead Thompson contacted Paul Cohen of Decca Records, who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray. In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label. In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to Hollywood, California where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson&#x27;s band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Have My Love&quot;. Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it. It was soon released as Jackson&#x27;s debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country and Western Sides chart. Upon Decca&#x27;s encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Somebody Else Will&quot;. Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by Jimmy &amp; Johnny that reached the charts.

Instead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Jackson also did her first performance at the Grand Ole Opry while in town. For the performance, her mother made a dress fitted with spaghetti straps and a sweetheart neckline. Host Ernest Tubb told her it was unacceptable, so she covered it with a fringe jacket. She later recalled hearing fellow Opry members making negative comments about her while she was onstage. &quot;I decided that night that the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; scene was not for me,&quot; she recounted.

In 1955, Jackson graduated from Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City and began touring. Jackson&#x27;s father quit his job to become her full-time manager and he hired Bob Neal to book her engagements. Jackson&#x27;s first concert dates included up-and-coming performer Elvis Presley. Together, the pair worked multiple shows alongside several other country performers in the United States that year. Jackson&#x27;s father chaperoned her during the shows and drove her from one date to the next. Presley encouraged her to perform rock and roll music. He played her several R&amp;B records and informed her of rock&#x27;s growing popularity. Jackson also joined the cast of the &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in 1955.

===1956–1960: Rock and roll years===
In 1956, Decca Records released Jackson from her contract. With Hank Thompson&#x27;s help, she secured a new contract with Capitol Records the same year. At her first Capitol recording session, Jackson cut two country songs and one rock and roll selection. One song, &quot;I Gotta Know&quot;, incorporated elements of both country and rock. According to Jackson, the song&#x27;s mixture of rock allowed her to get acquainted with the genre. Released as a single in 1956, &quot;I Gotta Know&quot; became Jackson&#x27;s second commercially successful release, peaking at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country and western sides chart. Jackson continued recording rock and roll music under her Capitol contract and was given full permission to do so by producer Ken Nelson. Jackson also composed several of her Capitol recordings, including &quot;Baby Loves Him&quot;, &quot;Cool Love&quot; and &quot;Mean Mean Man&quot;. She continued recording country music as well, often putting each style on either side of a single release.

Writers and critics have remarked positively about Jackson&#x27;s recordings from the 1950s and noted their take on women&#x27;s sexuality. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann described songs like &quot;Baby Loves Him&quot; as &quot;rockabilly classics&quot;. In addition, they commented that Jackson&#x27;s rock records were &quot;sexually aggressive&quot; and demonstrated &quot;almost frightening savagery&quot;. Bruce Eder added that Jackson&#x27;s material was at times &quot;astonishingly raucous and even raunchy&quot;. Meanwhile, Kurt Wolff found that Jackson&#x27;s rock material was also mixed with traditional country elements, which added to her musical individuality: &quot;Jackson mixed straight country material and hot-to-the-core rockabilly numbers almost right from the beginning...Songs like &#x27;Fujiyama Mama&#x27; and &#x27;Mean Mean Man&#x27; were hard and fast, giving her plenty of reason to shimmy around in her glamorous fringe dresses&quot;.

In 1957, Jackson began working under a new booking agent, who arranged several tours in 1957 and 1958. Fellow performers included Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. With her new management, Jackson was making more money, sometimes as much as $500 per gig. Meanwhile, her follow-up singles proved unsuccessful in the United States. According to Jackson, Capitol was unsure how to market her. &quot;Capitol was still trying to figure out what to do with me, but they maintained faith that I could have strong potential in the teen market,&quot; she recalled in 2017. To promote her material, the label chose to release Jackson&#x27;s eponymous debut album in 1958. The record mixed both rock and country selections. Included were her covers of the rock songs &quot;Money Honey&quot; and &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;. Also included were the country songs &quot;Heartbreak Ahead&quot; and &quot;Making Believe&quot;. Produced by Ken Nelson, it was released on Capitol in July 1958 with six tracks on either side of the record.
Also in 1958, Jackson saw success overseas with the rock and roll single, &quot;Fujiyama Mama&quot;. Ken Nelson was reluctant to release the song, with its references to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Yet, the disc found commercial appeal with Japanese fans, reaching number one on the nation&#x27;s music chart. The song&#x27;s success led Jackson to a Japanese tour in 1959. She played venues in major cities including Tokyo and Okinawa. Upon her return to America, Jackson played in Las Vegas with Bob Wills and did additional concerts with her newly formed touring band. At different points, the band lineup included Roy Clark and black pianist Big Al Downing. She recalled touring alongside Downing, who was sometimes denied entrance into venues because of his race. In response, Jackson would refuse to work a show unless Downing performed with her. &quot;Look, he&#x27;s part of our band. If he&#x27;s not welcome, then none of us are,&quot; she once told a club owner.

In 1960, Jackson&#x27;s album cover of &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot; was discovered by an Iowa disc jockey, which led to an increased interest in it by radio listeners. Upon the encouragement of Capitol Records, &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot; was issued as a single the same year. By July 1960, the single had reached number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop music chart, becoming her first American rock and roll hit. It also found commercial success in Australia and the United Kingdom. The success of &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot; led to Jackson to rename her band &quot;The Party Timers&quot; and prompted her label to release the compilation, &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Wanda&quot; (1960). The album included her previously recorded rock songs from the 1950s. It would later be reviewed positively by AllMusic, which gave it four and a half stars.

Her third studio album for Capitol, as noted, came along in early 1961, titled &quot;There&#x27;s a Party Goin&#x27; On&quot;, which included more rock and roll material. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic described the LP as a &quot;pretty solid and energetic set&quot; despite not having &quot;most of Wanda&#x27;s best rockabilly sides&quot;.

===1961–1971: New languages and return to country music===
In the early 1960s, old school rock and roll musicians lost favor as the &quot;Big Beat&quot; of the British Invasion grew in popularity. Feeling pressure from Capitol, Ken Nelson met with Jackson to discuss which genre she should fit. Because she had her greatest commercial success with country music, it was ultimately decided to invest Jackson there. &quot;I wanted to record whatever I wanted to record, but I also understood that Capitol Records had made an investment in me,&quot; she recalled in her book. In 1961, Jackson returned with the self-penned track &quot;Right or Wrong&quot;. She initially intended to pitch the song to Brenda Lee, but Nelson believed Jackson could have success with her own version. Jackson agreed and recorded the track. The single climbed to number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart, the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary survey. An album of the same name followed in 1961 that split country selections on &quot;side A&quot; and Rockabilly selections on &quot;side B&quot;. Her next single release, &quot;In the Middle of a Heartache&quot;, was also a commercial success. reaching number six on the country chart and number 27 on the pop chart.
In August 1962, Jackson&#x27;s fourth studio album was released titled &quot;Wonderful Wanda&quot;. The album included &quot;In the Middle of a Heartache&quot;, along with the crossover hits &quot;If I Cried Every Time You Hurt Me&quot; and &quot;A Little Bitty Tear&quot;. The latter single had been released following Burl Ives&#x27;s version, which became more commercially successful than hers. &quot;Wonderful Wanda&quot; received a positive review from critics, including &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, which described her vocal performance as being &quot;in fine form&quot;. Jackson and The Party Timers then toured the southwestern United States for a series of one-night concert engagements. Now newly married, husband Wendell Goodman quit his job with IBM to become her full-time manager in 1962. Capitol continued releasing further country-flavored recordings by Jackson. In 1963, the label released her studio album of orchestrated country pop recordings titled &quot;Love Me Forever&quot;. It was followed in 1964 by her sixth studio album titled &quot;Two Sides of Wanda&quot;, which was another split disc of rockabilly and country selections.

In 1965, Jackson partnered with Capitol&#x27;s German record distributor named Electrola Records. The label arranged for her to record music in the German language because her singing voice was &quot;very pleasing to the German ear&quot;. That year, she flew to Cologne, Germany where she cut several selections in German. Material was written especially for Jackson and she was coached through singing in German with the help of a vocal instructor. Following the sessions, Capitol released &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; as a single to the German market in 1965. The song became her first number one single in her career, climbing to the top of the Austrian pop chart and the top five of the German pop list. In Germany and Austria, Jackson had several more charting songs, including the top ten &quot;Doch dann kam Johnny&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s foreign-language success led to several European tours during the 1960s, including a package show with Roy Orbison. Upon her return to the United States, Jackson recorded for Capitol Records in Dutch as well as Japanese.

In the United States, Jackson became more identified with the country genre as the 1960s progressed. Between 1965 and 1967, she hosted her own syndicated country television program titled &quot;Music Village&quot;. In 1965, &quot;Blues in My Heart&quot;, became her first album to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart, peaking at number nine. In 1966, Jackson had her first American commercial success in several years with the top 20 single &quot;The Box It Came In&quot;. It was followed by the number 11 chart hit &quot;Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine&quot;. The singles were issued on her tenth studio album titled &quot;Reckless Love Affair&quot; (1967). The album became her third chart entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums list, peaking at number 17. Jackson had eleven more charting &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles during the 1960s, including the top 40 songs &quot;A Girl Don&#x27;t Have to Drink to Have Fun&quot;, &quot;Both Sides of the Line&quot;, &quot;My Baby Walked Right Out on Me&quot; and &quot;Two Separate Bar Stools&quot;. Her 1969 single, &quot;My Big Iron Skillet&quot;, reached number 20 on the country chart. Her three studio albums, &quot;You&#x27;ll Always Have My Love&quot; (1967), &quot;Cream of the Crop&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Many Moods of Wanda Jackson&quot; (1968) made the &quot;Billboard&quot; country LP&#x27;s list.

Jackson&#x27;s country recordings also received attention from music critics and journalists. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine described a 1965 studio album as both &quot;poetic and tearful&quot;. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann gave the music a mixed review in their 2003 book: &quot;Of Wanda&#x27;s many country hits between 1961 and 1972, none recaptured her rockabilly zing, although several were self-assertive about women&#x27;s issues.&quot; Meanwhile, Kurt Wolff described her mid-1960s singles as &quot;deeply bitter and vengeful&quot;, while also having &quot;genuine honky-tonk emotion&quot;. In reviewing a 2006 country compilation album, AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek found Jackson to be &quot;a solid, original country singer&quot;.

In 1969, Jackson recorded her first live record in Phoenix, Arizona titled &quot;Wanda Jackson in Person&quot;. Following the album, Capitol Records started replacing Ken Nelson with different producers to record Jackson. This included a two-album stint with producer George Richey, which ended in creative differences, according to Jackson. Richey and Jackson&#x27;s recordings led to her next major hit called &quot;A Woman Lives for Love&quot; (1970). The single reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs list. In 1971, Jackson was assigned Larry Butler to produce her next studio album titled &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Sing&quot;. The project was a commercial success after reaching number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country LP&#x27;s list, becoming her first charting album since 1968. It also spawned the single &quot;Fancy Satin Pillows&quot;, which became her final top 20 hit on the American country chart.

===1972–1983: Gospel and christian music transition===
In the early 1970s, Jackson and her husband became born-again Christians. The shift in her personal life prompted Jackson to concentrate more on Gospel music. &quot;Wendell and I both felt like God was calling us to stop working in nightclubs and bars in order to dedicate ourselves to the ministry,&quot; her autobiography recounted. Jackson&#x27;s husband started removing her concerts from the country music night club circuit (which accounted for eighty percent of her income). She also began giving her testimony on stage, and played various tent show revivals. In 1972, Capitol released her first Gospel studio project called &quot;Praise the Lord&quot;. The LP featured vocal harmonies from The Oak Ridge Boys and included Jackson&#x27;s first self-penned track. The record was well received by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, who called it &quot;a beautiful spiritual album&quot;.

To fulfill her obligations with Capitol, Jackson continued releasing country LP&#x27;s. In 1972, the company released &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Want You Any Other Way&quot;, a ten-track collection of traditional country songs. It included the top 40 country hits &quot;Back Then&quot; and &quot;I Already Know (What I&#x27;m Getting for My Birthday)&quot;. In her next studio sessions, Jackson asked Ken Nelson to record another gospel record, which he did not support. At the same time, Word Records offered a contract that would allow her the freedom to record more spiritual material. Knowing she was unhappy, Nelson allowed Jackson to accept Word&#x27;s offer and she was released from her Capitol contract. Capitol released her last studio album in 1973 titled &quot;Country Keepsakes&quot;. The disc peaked at number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country LP&#x27;s chart.
Jackson&#x27;s signing with Word allowed her to also record with their imprint label Myrrh Records. In her autobiography, Jackson explained that Word would release her gospel records while Myrrh would release her country records. In 1973, Word issued her second gospel album titled &quot;Country Gospel&quot;. The project featured covers of the hymn &quot;Farther Along&quot; and Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s Christian tune &quot;Why Me, Lord&quot;. In 1974, Myrrh released the country record &quot;When It&#x27;s Time to Fall in Love Again&quot;. Spawned from the album was the single, &quot;Come on Home (To This Lonely Heart)&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as &quot;a beautiful love song&quot; that hinted at her Christian &quot;inner spirits&quot;. The single was Jackson&#x27;s last to chart on the Hot Country Singles survey, peaking at number 98. Jackson later claimed that Word lost interest in her country recordings after being bought out by Dot Records. She was then left to only record gospel. &quot;I was stuck, once again, being pigeonholed,&quot; Jackson commented in her book.

For the remainder of the decade, Word and Myrrh released three more studio recordings of Jackson&#x27;s gospel material: &quot;Now I Have Everything&quot; (1975), &quot;Make Me Like a Child Again&quot; (1976), and &quot;Closer to Jesus&quot; (1977) Reflecting on the LP&#x27;s in her autobiography, Jackson commented that none of them were &quot;particularly memorable&quot; to her. In 1979, her contract with the labels ended. In need of a change, the Jackson family temporarily moved to Texas where she became a stay-at-home mother. Yet, the family was unhappy with the move. In 1980, they relocated to Oklahoma City where they built a house and she continued her entertainment career. The same year, Jackson released a new country disc on the UK-based Deep Sea Music company titled &quot;Good Times&quot;. The album spawned one single, a cover of Melba Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Good Times Fool You&quot;. In 1982, K-tel released a studio album of re-recordings titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot;. With limited commercial attention to her music, Jackson felt professionally-stuck. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t even fifty yet, but I felt like I&#x27;d been forced into an early retirement as time had passed me by,&quot; she recalled in her 2017 book.

===1984–2006: Rock and roll revival===
In the mid-1980s, rockabilly music increased in popularity in Europe, as did rock and roll. Jackson&#x27;s Capitol rock recordings received interest from European fans and she was soon sought out by overseas promoters. Jackson and her husband saw the opportunity as a message from God. &quot;Wendell and I both realized that God was going to use our testimony in places that needed it&quot;, her autobiography explained. In 1984, her husband received a phone call from Swedish businessman, Harry Holmes, who was interested in recording her. Jackson then traveled to Scandinavia to record her first album of rock material in two decades. In 1984, Tab Records released &quot;Rockabilly Fever&quot;. The album was later released in the United States as &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Away Your Blues&quot;. The project featured covers of rockabilly numbers like &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only Make Believe&quot;. The album received a three-star rating from Allmusic, while writers Mary Bufwack and Robert Oermann positively described it as &quot;rockabilly fire&quot;.
Jackson frequently toured Europe during this period and sang her 1950s rockabilly records. Many of the songs she performed had not been in her regular stage show for years. She recalled having to re-learn the lyrics to songs like &quot;Mean Mean Man&quot; after getting hundreds of requests. As the decade progressed, she found opportunities touring in various European counties, including Spain, Switzerland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Continued interest in her rock music led to further album releases, including 1988&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party in Prague&quot;. The album was a collaborative studio LP with Czech performer Karel Zich and was released on the Supraphon label. She also continued releasing gospel material, such as &quot;Show Me the Way to Calvary&quot; (1981) on the Christian World label and &quot;Teach Me to Love&quot; (1984) on Vine Records. She also issued new collections of country recordings, such as &quot;Classy Country&quot; on Amethyst Records (1988).

In the 1990s, Jackson was informed of rockabilly&#x27;s resurgence in the United States by country artist Rosie Flores. The two visited at Jackson&#x27;s home where Flores played several rockabilly records and informed her the growing American fan-base. A friendship developed between the two performers and Jackson later appeared on Flores&#x27;s album &quot;Rockabilly Filly&quot; (1995). Following the album&#x27;s release, the pair embarked on a five-week North American tour. Jackson was surprised to find that her audience was young and the venues were at times uncomfortable: &quot;It was kind of eye-opening. Even though the rooms were a little frightening, the audiences couldn&#x27;t have been sweeter,&quot; she stated. In the mid 1990s, Jackson also collaborated with The Alligators for studio releases on the Success and Elap labels: &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Queen of Rock&#x27; a &#x27;Billy&quot; (1997).

In 2001, Jackson played at the Rockabilly Festival in Jackson, Tennessee alongside The Cadillac Angels. In October 2003, CMH Records released her first American rock album in several decades titled &quot;Heart Trouble&quot;. She recalled in her autobiography that the project was originally intended to be a bluegrass collection. After word spread that Jackson would record an album, several rock musicians contacted the label about joining the production. Musicians that collaborated on the CD included Rosie Flores, The Cramps and Elvis Costello. AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek praised the disc in his review: &quot;Simply put, this is a rock &amp; roll dream, full of raw, sharp performances, killer songs, and Jackson&#x27;s irrepressible ability to take even the most innocent song and make it salacious.&quot; Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters called the album a &quot;triumphant return&quot; despite the fact that it &quot;uses the same gimmicks as lesser &#x27;comeback&#x27; albums.&quot;

In January 2006, Goldenlane Records issued Jackson&#x27;s forty-third studio album, titled &quot;I Remember Elvis&quot;. The disc was dedicated to Elvis Presley, who she paid tribute to in the liner notes: &quot;Without the encouragement of Elvis, I may have never recorded rock and roll. So this tribute is just my way of saying thank you to a dear friend.&quot; The project received a positive response from Mark Deming of AllMusic, who wrote, &quot;&quot;I Remember Elvis&quot; is something short of revelatory, but it is a sincere and loving tribute to an influential artist from someone who learned from him first-hand. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the collection a three-star rating and praised Jackson&#x27;s vocals while noting that the arrangements lacked distinction from Presley&#x27;s originals.

===2007–2021: Collaborations and retirement===
Jackson continued a busy touring schedule in the late 2000&#x27;s. This included several performances in London, England and a popular gig in Santa Barbara, California. She also collaborated with Jerry Lee Lewis and Linda Gail Lewis for performances at the London Forum during this time. Following her 2009 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jackson was approached by rock musician Jack White to record her next album. The pair exchanged song ideas virtually and met for the first time in 2010 to record the album. Jackson did not think she would &quot;see eye to eye&quot; with White, who was used to recording &quot;contemporary rock-style music&quot;. She eventually became more trusting after getting to know him better. &quot;It was clear that Jack was for me in every way, and I felt honored by the respect he showed me,&quot; Jackson recalled in her autobiography. White had Jackson record several songs he selected, including Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Rip It Up&quot; and Amy Winehouse&#x27;s &quot;You Know I&#x27;m No Good&quot;. White also contacted Bob Dylan, who requested she record his original &quot;Thunder on the Mountain&quot;. Jackson agreed and cut the tracks, along with several others for the project.
In January 2011, her forty-second album was released, titled &quot;The Party Ain&#x27;t Over&quot;. The rock collection was released on Jack White&#x27;s record label named Third Man Records. It became Jackson&#x27;s first album to chart the Billboard 200 all-genre list, peaking at number 58. It also became her first disc to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Rock Albums chart, where it climbed to number 17. The record received a three-star rating from Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine who argued that White&#x27;s influence overshadowed Jackson&#x27;s musical image. Erlewine did praise Jackson&#x27;s vocals and found several tracks that felt like &quot;they belong to her&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Jon Dolan gave the album three and half stars and called the track listing &quot;superb&quot;. &quot;Jackson’s not content to just remake the greats: Her slaying of Amy Winehouse&#x27;s &#x27;You Know I’m No Good&#x27; is a master class for her wild-child inheritors&quot;, Dolan concluded. In her autobiography Jackson recalled making several television appearances to promote the disc. This included performances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Conan&quot;. She also recalled taking the stage for the first time in decades at the Grand Ole Opry.

Jackson did not think she could record an album better than her 2011 release. She was encouraged to return to the studio and collaborate with singer-songwriter Justin Townes Earle. In her autobiography, Jackson reflected that her voice was &quot;not in top form&quot; during the album&#x27;s recording. She blamed a long concert schedule for her vocal quality. In October 2012, Sugar Hill Records released the project titled &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. It included liner notes written by Stephen King. The CD peaked at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart in 2012, becoming her first disc in 39 years to reach a peak position there. Mark Deming of AllMusic gave the project a positive response in his review: &quot;&quot;Unfinished Business&quot; shows that six decades after her first recordings, that strategy still works, and she can still deliver the goods without a lot of needless fuss.&quot; Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; found the album was better-suited to Jackson&#x27;s musical roots compared to previous release, praising her vocal quality and Earle&#x27;s production.

In 2017, Jackson&#x27;s autobiography titled &quot;Every Night is Saturday Night: A Country Girl&#x27;s Journey to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&quot; was published. Co-written by Jackson and Scott Bomar, it was published by BMG Music and featured a foreword by Elvis Costello. According to an interview, Jackson had attempted an autobiography but found the writing &quot;didn&#x27;t come out well&quot;. Working with Bomar made Jackson feel more comfortable with writing a book. The launch was honored by a party, signing and performance at the Grammy Museum.

Jackson played a handful of 2018 shows before announcing her retirement in March 2019. She told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that a previously undisclosed stroke was partially to blame, along with additional &quot;health and safety concerns&quot;. In August 2021, Big Machine Records and Blackheart Records issued her next studio record titled &quot;Encore&quot;. The disc was produced by Joan Jett. Jett is featured performing on the record, along with Elle King and Angaleena Presley. Jackson announced that the project would be her last album. &quot;Encore&quot; featured songs co-written by Nashville songwriters like Will Hoge and Lori McKenna. It received a positive review from Mark Deming of AllMusic who gave it 3.5 stars: &quot;Clocking in at a very 1950s 25 minutes, &quot;Encore&quot; doesn&#x27;t feel like a major event and it doesn&#x27;t add a great deal to the Wanda Jackson story, but it&#x27;s a welcome reminder that the first truly great female rocker is still among us and hasn&#x27;t surrendered to time,&quot; he concluded. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; commented that Jackson &quot;sets the standard, and even in her seventh decade of making music, that confidence and control remain readily apparent.&quot;

==Artistry==
===Musical styles and voice===
Jackson&#x27;s musical style includes rockabilly, country and gospel music. In her early career, she was known for releasing country and rock records simultaneously. Music writers and critics have analyzed the reasoning behind this decision. Critic Bruce Eder explained that &quot;she spent years walking a tightrope between traditional country and rock &amp; roll, just trying to carve out a niche for herself and earn a living&quot;. Author Kurt Wolff wrote that Jackson released both genres simultaneously because she &quot;never [felt] the need to hide one set of songs from fans of the other.&quot; Critic William Ruhlmann theorized that Jackson &quot;was encouraged to straddle musical genres&quot; due to her record label&#x27;s worries that rock would decline in popularity.
Her characteristic vocal growl has also been a subject of discussion among writers, critics and historians. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann stated that Jackson&#x27;s vocal growl &quot;captured the elemental, low-class wildness of this music [rock and roll] better than any female of her day.&quot; NPR&#x27;s Maria Sherman claimed that Jackson&#x27;s snarl changed the way audiences view female singers and performers. Stephen L. Betts of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that Jackson&#x27;s vocal snarl gave her a &quot;one-of-a-kind voice like spring-loaded dynamite wrapped in sandpaper.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s singing growl led to one journalist dubbing her as &quot;a really sweet lady – with a nasty voice.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Jackson at number 149 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Jackson is also known for being able to yodel. Several selections in her catalog feature yodeling, including 1969&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy Yodel&quot; and 1975&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Put a Yodel in My Soul&quot;. &quot;I always yodelled. People just loved yodelling,&quot; she told the BBC.

===Performance style and image===
Jackson&#x27;s choice of stage wear and movement on stage has also been a subject of discussion. Unlike other female country performers, Jackson chose to dress in gold lamé outfits and sequined dresses, most of which were designed by her mother. &quot;I was the first one to put some glamour in the country music,&quot; she explained to the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann added that Jackson&#x27;s outfits demonstrated &quot;fire, energy, and uninhibited nerve that doubtless shocked conservatives&quot;. The way Jackson moved on stage has also been seen as uncharacteristic of other female performers. Bobby Moore added that Jackson&#x27;s live shows embedded &quot;upbeat songs&quot; and &quot;high-energy&quot; that &quot;compelled audience members to party like they don&#x27;t have to work the next day.&quot; In the same interview, she explained her reasoning for putting on a high-energy performance show: &quot;I feel like it&#x27;s my job to see that people have a good time when they come out to a concert.&quot;

===Influence===
Jackson has been referred to as &quot;The Queen of Rockabilly&quot; due to her being one of the early female performers in the rock genre. She has also been considered among the first women to have a life-long career in country music. Her career has influenced a series of performers in both the country and rock fields. Pam Tillis is among several country artists who regard Jackson as an influence. To honor her, Tillis included Jackson on her 1995 TNN concert series hosted at the Ryman Auditorium. Rosie Flores has also cited Jackson as an influence on her music and career. Flores spoke of how Jackson influenced her career in a 2012 interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;The main thing I learned was that the older you get, the music you do and the way you put it out doesn&#x27;t change. You don&#x27;t have to slow down. You can keep rocking. There is no age when it comes to rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; Jann Browne has also cited Jackson as a musical inspiration. She included Jackson on her 1990 studio album titled &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;. Miranda Lambert also found Jackson to be an influence on her career: &quot;Here was the woman who in so many ways, changed the way audiences and record labels viewed female artists. She literally helped to pave the way for me to do what I love each and every day.&quot;

In rock music, several artists have also named Jackson an artistic influence. Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Costello paid tribute to Jackson in her 2008 documentary centered on her life and career. Cyndi Lauper cited her as one of the earliest influences on her career, recording &quot;Funnel of Love&quot; for her 2016 album &quot;Detour&quot;. &quot;I think for country you look at Patsy Cline or Loretta Lynn who played a guitar, or sang the songs she wrote, and Dolly Parton. But Wanda Jackson was a rocker, and so, of course, I was going to listen and learn from her because I was a rocker and that&#x27;s what we did.&quot; Adele explained that a &quot;greatest hits&quot; package by Jackson helped influence her 2008 studio album, &quot;19&quot;. Elle King also named Jackson as an influence on her music in 2016.

==Recognition and legacy==
Jackson was twice nominated for Grammy Awards. Her 1964 album, &quot;Two Sides of Wanda&quot;, was nominated for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. In 1970, &quot;A Woman Lives for Love&quot; was nominated for the same. Her recording of &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2024.

Jackson&#x27;s work got more recognition several decades later when she received the Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts. She became the first female country and rock performer to receive the accolade.

During this period, various rock musicians began advocating for Jackson to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2005, Elvis Costello wrote a letter to the organization about why she should be inducted. Cyndi Lauper and Bruce Springsteen also advocated for her. In 2005, she was nominated by the organization. In 2009, Jackson was officially inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame under the category &quot;Early Influence&quot;. She was presented with the induction by singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash.

Jackson was also inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Country Music Hall of Fame. On an international level, she has been inducted into the International Gospel Hall of Fame and the German Country Music Hall of Fame.

In 2009, Oklahoma City named an alley for Jackson in the Bricktown entertainment district. Jackson&#x27;s hometown of Maud also named one of their streets after her. In 2010, she and John Mellencamp were recipients of the Lifetime Achievement award from the Americana Music Honors. In 2016, she was the recipient of the &quot;Founder of the Sound&quot; award at the Ameripolitan Music Awards.

In 2002, she was included on CMT&#x27;s televised special of the &quot;40 Great Women in Country Music&quot;. In 2006 Alfred Publishing acknowledged her influence on young musicians by publishing &quot;The Best of Wanda Jackson: Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot;, a songbook with music and lyrics to thirteen songs associated with Jackson. In 2008, the Smithsonian Channel released a documentary focused on Jackson&#x27;s career titled &quot;The Sweet Lady with the Nasty Voice&quot;. In 2019, Ken Burns profiled her in his televised documentary titled &quot;Country Music&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===

After Jackson spent time touring with Elvis Presley, the pair&#x27;s relationship became romantic in 1955. He asked her to make the relationship official by giving Jackson a small diamond ring that she wore on a necklace. In her autobiography, she explained that Presley &quot;won my heart as I was just beginning to understand what it really meant to embrace my femininity and express myself as a young woman.&quot; According to Jackson, the pair&#x27;s relationship ended in 1956 once Presley began appearing in films and Colonel Tom Parker took control of his career.

In her teen years, Jackson befriended aspiring country performer Norma Jean. The two often appeared on the &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; television show and socialized frequently. Norma Jean began dating local resident, Wendell Goodman, and Jackson sometimes joined them on dates. In 1961, Norma Jean accepted an offer to become a cast member of &quot;The Porter Wagoner Show&quot; in Nashville and ended her relationship with Goodman. Jackson and Goodman started dating shortly after their breakup. In her 2017 book, she recalled that she fell in love with him prior to their dating: &quot;When they [Norma Jean and Goodman] had first come into the house and I saw Wendell, that was it. It was love at first sight.&quot; The couple married in 1961. Goodman had begun a career in computers with IBM, but left the position to become his wife&#x27;s full-time business manager. He later oversaw and managed his wife&#x27;s company named Wanda Jackson Enterprises. In 2017, Goodman died at the age of 81.

The couple had two children together. Their daughter, Gina, was born in 1962 while their son, Greg, was born in 1964. Because Jackson&#x27;s husband traveled with her, their children were kept home and raised by nannies. Jackson&#x27;s parents also kept the children on weekends. &quot;I knew it wasn&#x27;t a normal childhood for them, and I&#x27;ve always carried a little guilt about that,&quot; she recalled in 2017.

===Personal challenges and spirituality===

By 1971, Jackson had become increasingly unhappy in her professional and personal life. &quot;I had everything that a person could need or want. But I still couldn&#x27;t shake that dull but persistent sense of emptiness inside,&quot; she later explained. She and her husband had also developed a problem with alcohol. Their problems with drinking led Goodman to become physically and verbally abusive with Jackson. Upon returning from a show, Jackson recalled going to church with her family and having a life-altering experience. &quot;After we got up off our knees, everything was different,&quot; she stated in her autobiography. The couple found solace in Christianity and dedicated their personal lives to spirituality in 1971. They were later baptized, and the couple went on to state that faith saved their marriage.

The couple&#x27;s belief in their faith would lead them to working with Evangelists in Dallas, Texas during the late 1970s. Her husband set up an office building in the city where that offered resources to various ministries in the local area. As Jackson&#x27;s rockabilly music revived in the 1980s, the couple decided to invest less professional time with Christianity. &quot;It was hard to feel right about singing in bars again, but God confirmed in my spirit, time and time again, that that&#x27;s where He wanted me and that&#x27;s where I could be most effective,&quot; she explained in her autobiography.

===Health problems===
In the 2010s, Jackson developed pneumonia and was hospitalized for a week. A knee replacement became infected with MRSA and she fell several times in her Oklahoma house, damaging her shoulder. In 2017, her internal bleeding was treated at a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico that focused on nutritional and medical therapy. A 2018 stroke led her to retire. She said it would have impaired her more if her daughter had brought her to the hospital later. &quot;I was so fortunate&quot;, she told &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2021.
