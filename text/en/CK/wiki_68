<text>A (&quot;colonel general&quot;) was the second-highest general officer rank in the German &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, the Austro-Hungarian Common Army, the East German National People&#x27;s Army and in their respective police services. The rank was equal to a four-star full general but below a general field marshal. The rank was equivalent to a &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; until 1945 or to a &quot;Flottenadmiral&quot; in the &quot;Volksmarine&quot; until 1990. It was the highest ordinary military rank and the highest military rank awarded in peacetime; the higher rank of general field marshal was awarded only in wartime by the head of state. In general, a &quot;Generaloberst&quot; had the same privileges as a general field marshal.

A literal translation of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; would be &quot;uppermost general&quot;, but it is often translated as &quot;colonel-general&quot; by analogy to &quot;Oberst&quot;, &quot;colonel&quot;, such as in countries in which the rank was adopted like Russia (, &quot;general-polkovnik&quot;). &quot;Oberst&quot; derives from the superlative form of Germanic &quot;ober&quot; (&quot;upper&quot;), cognate to English &quot;over&quot; and so &quot;superior general&quot; might be a more idiomatic rendering.

The rank was created in 1854, originally for Emperor William I, the Prince of Prussia, because members of the royal family were traditionally not promoted to the rank of field marshal and it was limited to wartime.
In the 19th century, the rank was largely honorary and usually held only by members of the princely families or the Governor of Berlin. The regular promotion of professional officers to the grade did not begin until 1911.

Since the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; was reserved for wartime promotions, the additional distinction of a &quot;Colonel general with the rank of field marshal&quot; () was created. Such generals were entitled to wear three pips and a marshal&#x27;s crossed batons on their shoulder boards, compared to the three pips of a Colonel General; however, this was changed to four pips in 1911. 

&quot;Generaloberst&quot; was the second-highest general officer rank, below field marshal, in the Prussian Army as well as in the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1921–1933), the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (which included the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, established in 1935) of Nazi Germany (1933–45) and the East German &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot; (1949–1991). As military ranks were often used for other uniformed services, the rank was also used by the Waffen-SS and the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; of Nazi Germany and the &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; and &quot;Stasi&quot; of East Germany. In East Germany, the rank was junior to the general of the army (&quot;Armeegeneral&quot;), as well as to the briefly-extant and never-awarded rank of &quot;Marschall der DDR&quot;.

== Austro-Hungarian Army==

In 1915 the &quot;Generaloberst&quot; – &quot;Vezérezredes&quot; rank was introduced to the Austro-Hungarian Common Army. It was the second highest behind the &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; – &quot;Tábornagy&quot; rank.

<text>The Wasserwacht (; &quot;water watch&quot; or &quot;water guard&quot;) is a German lifeguard service. It is one of the five voluntary societies of the German Red Cross. The Wasserwacht is a non-profit organization made up of on volunteers.

== Tasks ==
The main task of the Wasserwacht is the prevention of drowning.
The Wasserwacht&#x27;s activities encompass many areas, including:

=== Swimming (Schwimmen) ===
A task of the Wasserwacht is the training of nonswimmers and the continuation of swimming education among the population. Badges are awarded based on the level of education, and begin with the &quot;Seepferdchen&quot; (literally &quot;seahorse&quot;; the early certificate) up to the Gold German Swimming Badge.

=== Rescue Swimming (Rettungsschwimmen) ===

This group is responsible for the education and training of lifeguards, swiftwater rescuers and rescue swimmers. It cooperates with German civil protection and German fire services, especially concerning floods.
* Teaching of swimming, rescue swimming (German rescue swimming badge) and first aid to the population, especially youth, in schools and federations
* Organization of competitions in life saving

=== Boating (Motorboot) ===

The Wasserwacht provides live-saving services on most lakes in as well as on the coast of Germany. Therefore, they require fast and powerful transportation in case of an emergency.
The Wasserwacht oversees regattas and sailing meetings.

=== Rescue diving (Rettungstauchen) ===
Rescue divers are needed for the salvaging of goods, vehicles, garbage, and corpses. The education of a rescue diver usually takes one to two years. Each active rescue diver of the Wasserwacht is required to undergo a dive-medical investigation annually.

=== Environmental protection (Naturschutz) ===
A task of the Wasserwacht is helping to keep nature and waterways clean.

In order to accomplish these tasks the Wasserwacht educates interested people with qualified technical abilities from the other departments of the German Red Cross.

== History ==
The Bavarian city Regensburg is considered to be the birthplace of the lifeguard service of the German Red Cross. In 1883, during a flood, German Red Cross aids were used for the first time. In the following years, &quot;Sanität und Wasserwehrkolonnen&quot; (medical and water rescue stations) developed along the coast and inland waters.

After World War II, the Wasserwacht, as a government organization, was forbidden by the allied military administration. But the Bavarian Red Cross, Bavarian regional organization of the German Red Cross, received permission to resume its work. Other regional organizations followed the example of Bavaria and reinstated their lifeguard services.

== Schnelleinsatzgruppen ==
For the execution of emergency services on water, the Wasserwacht maintains Schnelleinsatzgruppen (emergency response units). The groups are usually equipped with special lifeguard and emergency service machinery.

<doc id="1138847" wikidata="Q4792165" url="?curid=1138847" title="Arlene Phillips">
<text>Dame Arlene Phillips (born 22 May 1943) is an English choreographer, talent scout, television judge and presenter, theatre director, and former dancer, who has worked in many fields of entertainment.

For many years, she was most noted as the choreographer of numerous West End and Broadway musicals, films, and television shows, but she later achieved mainstream fame as a judge on television talent shows including &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;.

== Early life ==
Phillips was born on 22 May 1943 in Prestwich, Lancashire. She has a brother, Ian and a sister, Karen. She attended Broughton Preparatory School, Cheetham Hill, Manchester; Beaver Road Primary School, Didsbury; and Manchester Central High School for Girls after passing the eleven plus exam. When Phillips was 15, her mother, who had been suffering from leukaemia, died aged 43 just before Phillips was due to take her exams.

Phillips originally wanted to be a ballet dancer and began dance classes at the age of three, studying ballet and tap dance at the Muriel Tweedy School in Manchester after leaving school at 16. Her mother had always expressed a desire to dance, which inspired Phillips into pursuing dance professionally.

== Professional career ==
Phillips is internationally renowned as a choreographer and director of West End and Broadway musicals, but has many other professional credits. In her mid-teens, Phillips moved to London. where she developed her own style of jazz dance, strongly influenced by American Modern Jazz dance popular in London at that time. She went on to teach her style of jazz dance at The Dance Centre, later named Pineapple Dance Studios in Covent Garden, and at the Italia Conti Stage School, so establishing herself as a successful teacher and choreographer.

Phillips was assistant choreographer on the 1982 film &quot;Annie&quot; and the promotional video for the Duran Duran song &quot;The Wild Boys,&quot; named Best British Video at the 1985 BRIT Awards. In the summer of 1996, she was stage director on the opening run of Michael Flatley&#x27;s Irish dance show, &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; at Dublin&#x27;s Point Theatre.

Phillips choreographed the 2002 Commonwealth Games opening and closing ceremonies alongside fellow Mancunian, David Zolkwer.

From 2004 to 2008, she was a judge on the BBC One show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, and commented on the acts in &quot;&quot; for the BBC in 2009. In 2008, she created, produced, and choreographed the ITV television serial &quot;Britannia High&quot;.

Following Phillips&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Your Country Needs You&quot;, she choreographed the performance of the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. She went on to choreograph Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s performance of the UK entry in the 2012 contest in Baku.

In March 2013, Arlene appeared on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance For Comic Relief&quot; in the Dance Judge Panel with Greg James and Lee Mack.

== Hot Gossip ==

In Britain, Phillips first became a household name as the director and choreographer of Hot Gossip, a British dance troupe which she formed in 1974, using students she was teaching at the time. Hot Gossip spent two years performing in a London night club where Phillips and her manager developed the group&#x27;s dance act.

==&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;==

Phillips was a member of the inaugural judging panel between 2004 and 2008 for the BBC television series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, alongside fellow judges Len Goodman, Craig Revel Horwood, and Bruno Tonioli.
In 2005 and 2006, Phillips was a judge for the spin-off series &quot;Strictly Dance Fever&quot;, which was also created by the BBC to seek dancers wishing to join the chorus of a West End musical. Later in 2007, she created and judged another BBC dance series, &quot;DanceX&quot;, a show formed to find a new commercial dance act. After the initial audition process, the competitors were split into two troupes of dancers, with Phillips mentoring one troupe and the other being mentored by her fellow &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; judge Bruno Tonioli. The two troupes competed live on television each week, with Tonioli&#x27;s troupe being the eventual winners.

=== Departure from &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; ===
After the close of the 2008 series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, the BBC announced that several changes would be made to refresh the show in 2009. This led to a great deal of speculation in the media that Phillips might be dropped from the judging panel, but the BBC refused to respond to reports. They finally confirmed the news at the launch of their autumn schedule on 9 July 2009: she was replaced by former Strictly winner Alesha Dixon. The news led to much criticism being directed towards the BBC for its apparent discrimination against older women on television; the BBC, however, strongly denied this.

The replacement of Phillips led to an unprecedented intervention from the then Minister for Women and Equality, Harriet Harman. During a session in the House of Commons, Harman responded to questions stating that she believed the decision to drop Arlene Phillips was motivated by age discrimination, and called on the BBC to ensure that she would be taking part in the new series. The BBC did not formally respond to Harman&#x27;s request, but repeated its comments that the decision was not due to age.

==Later activities==
In October 2009, Phillips appeared on the first episode of the 38th series of the satirical show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. Between April and July 2010, she made nine guest panellist appearances on ITV&#x27;s flagship show &quot;Loose Women&quot;.

===&quot;Britannia High&quot;===

In 2007, Phillips became the Executive Producer and Creative Director for the ITV television series &quot;Britannia High&quot;. The show was a fictional drama about the lives of six students at a London performing arts school. Based on an idea by Phillips and West End producer David Ian, the series was marketed as the UK&#x27;s answer to Disney&#x27;s &quot;High School Musical&quot;. The show&#x27;s music was created and written by hit songwriter, and Take That frontman, Gary Barlow.

===&quot;So You Think You Can Dance?&quot;===
Phillips has also been a judge on the UK version of &quot;So You Think You Can Dance?&quot;. The show&#x27;s original creator Nigel Lythgoe is head judge on the series, and Phillips is joined on the panel by pop singer Louise Redknapp, and dancer and choreographer Sisco Gomez. Phillips&#x27;s appointment as judge for the series came soon after the controversy over her departure from &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. The first episode aired on BBC One in January 2010, and there have been two further series.

===&quot;Gala for Grenfell&quot;===
In July 2017, Phillips announced a dance gala to raise funds for those affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. The Gala for Grenfell took place on 30 July 2017 at the Adelphi Theatre, London and included stars from &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, The Royal Ballet and Sir Matthew Bourne&#x27;s New Adventures company. Phillips said of the dancers taking part &quot;They’re just doing it as themselves because each of the dancers is giving a gift and I want you to see them, and that they’re doing it for the love&quot;. The proceeds from the event went to the Kensington &amp; Chelsea Foundation, the charity running the Grenfell Tower Fund.

===Spoken word tour===
In 2017, Phillips embarked on a UK-wide spoken word tour, in conversation with Jacquie Storey.

===&quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;===
In November 2021, Phillips at the age of 78 became the oldest ever contestant to appear on ITV&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. The record was formerly held by Stanley Johnson who took part in the 17th series of the show at the age of 77. Phillips participated in series 21 of the show and was the first celebrity eliminated.

===&quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;===
On 20 February 2022, Phillips joined ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; as a guest Judge for Musicals week.

== Honours ==
Phillips was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 Birthday Honours and in 2006 she received a Carl Alan Award for Outstanding Services made by the International Dance Teachers Association.

Phillips was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to dance and charity, and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to dance and charity.

==Personal life==
Phillips has been in a relationship with Angus Ion, a set builder, since 1985. The couple first met on the set of the music video for the Freddie Mercury song &quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot;.

==&quot;Alana Dancing Star&quot; books==
In 2010, Phillips wrote a series of children&#x27;s fiction books. &quot;Alana Dancing Star&quot; is a series of six books, in which the title character explores different genres of dance. The series covers ballroom dance, samba, hip-hop, Bollywood, Broadway, and tango. In summer 2011, one of the books, &quot;Viennese Waltz&quot;, was selected to be part of Richard and Judy&#x27;s Summer Children&#x27;s Reading List.

<text>Bursa Malaysia is the stock exchange in Malaysia. It is one of the largest bourses in ASEAN. It is based in Kuala Lumpur and was previously known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). It provides full integration of transactions, offering a wide range of currency exchange and related services, including trading, settlement, clearing and savings services.

Along with the Securities Commission of Malaysia, the stock exchange regulates the capital market in Malaysia and, through its facilities, upholds the duty to manage and maintain order in the trading of stocks, bonds and derivatives.

== History ==
Bursa Malaysia was established in 1930, when the Singapore Stockbrokers Association became an official organization of securities in Malaya. In 1937, it was re-registered as the Stockbrokers&#x27; Association of Malaya, but it still did not trade public shares. In 1960, the Malayan Stock Exchange was formed and public trading started on 9 May that year. In 1961, a board system was introduced in two trading places, one in Singapore and one in Kuala Lumpur. The two trading rooms were linked by direct telephone lines into a single market with the same stocks and shares listed at a single set of prices on both boards.

The Malaysian Stock Exchange was formally formed in 1964, and in the following year, with the separation of Singapore from Malaysia, the stock exchange continued to function under the Malaysian and Singapore Stock Exchange (MSSE). 

In 1973, with the termination of currency interchangeability between Malaysia and Singapore, the SEMS was separated into the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Bhd (KLSEB) and the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES). Malaysian companies continued to be listed on SES and vice versa. A new company limited by guarantee, The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) took over operations of KLSEB as the stock exchange. In 1994, it was renamed Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.

It also fully suspended the trading of CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) counters, indefinitely freezing approximately US$4.47 billion worth of shares and affecting 172,000 investors, most of them Singaporeans.

Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) became a demutualized exchange and was renamed Bursa Malaysia in 2004. It consists of a Main Board, a Second Board and MESDAQ (now ACE Market) with total market capitalization of (USD$397.39 billion).

On 7 May 2024, Bursa Malaysia hit RM2 trillion in market capitalisation for the first time.

<doc id="1138853" wikidata="Q318761" url="?curid=1138853" title="Abelian integral">
<text>In mathematics, an abelian integral, named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, is an integral in the complex plane of the form

:formula_1

where formula_2 is an arbitrary rational function of the two variables formula_3 and formula_4, which are related by the equation

:formula_5 

where formula_6 is an irreducible polynomial in formula_4,

:formula_8

whose coefficients formula_9, formula_10 are rational functions of formula_3. The value of an abelian integral depends not only on the integration limits, but also on the path along which the integral is taken; it is thus a multivalued function of formula_12.

Abelian integrals are natural generalizations of elliptic integrals, which arise when

:formula_13

where formula_14 is a polynomial of degree 3 or 4. Another special case of an abelian integral is a hyperelliptic integral, where formula_15, in the formula above, is a polynomial of degree greater than 4.

== History ==
The theory of abelian integrals originated with a paper by Abel published in 1841. This paper was written during his stay in Paris in 1826 and presented to Augustin-Louis Cauchy in October of the same year. This theory, later fully developed by others, was one of the crowning achievements of nineteenth century mathematics and has had a major impact on the development of modern mathematics. In more abstract and geometric language, it is contained in the concept of abelian variety, or more precisely in the way an algebraic curve can be mapped into abelian varieties. Abelian integrals were later connected to the prominent mathematician David Hilbert&#x27;s 16th Problem, and they continue to be considered one of the foremost challenges in contemporary mathematics.

== Modern view ==
In the theory of Riemann surfaces, an abelian integral is a function related to the indefinite integral of a differential of the first kind. Suppose we are given a Riemann surface formula_16 and on it a differential 1-form formula_17 that is everywhere holomorphic on formula_16, and fix a point formula_19 on formula_16, from which to integrate. We can regard

:formula_21

as a multi-valued function formula_22, or (better) an honest function of the chosen path formula_23 drawn on formula_16 from formula_19 to formula_26. Since formula_16 will in general be multiply connected, one should specify formula_23, but the value will in fact only depend on the homology class of formula_23. 

In the case of formula_16 a compact Riemann surface of genus 1, i.e. an elliptic curve, such functions are the elliptic integrals. Logically speaking, therefore, an abelian integral should be a function such as formula_31.

Such functions were first introduced to study hyperelliptic integrals, i.e., for the case where formula_16 is a hyperelliptic curve. This is a natural step in the theory of integration to the case of integrals involving algebraic functions formula_33, where formula_34 is a polynomial of degree formula_35. The first major insights of the theory were given by Abel; it was later formulated in terms of the Jacobian variety formula_36. Choice of formula_19 gives rise to a standard holomorphic function

:formula_38

of complex manifolds. It has the defining property that the holomorphic 1-forms on formula_38, of which there are &quot;g&quot; independent ones if &quot;g&quot; is the genus of &quot;S&quot;, pull back to a basis for the differentials of the first kind on &quot;S&quot;.

<text>John Warden Brooke, 2nd Viscount Brookeborough, PC (NI) (9 November 1922 – 5 March 1987), was a Northern Irish politician. He was the son of the 1st Viscount Brookeborough, third Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.

==Early life==
He was educated at Eton College. During the Second World War he served in the British Army in North Africa, Italy and Germany. He was on the personal staff of Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander (later created Lord Alexander). He was an Aide-de-Camp to Field Marshal Lord Wavell, the Viceroy of India, early in 1947.

In 1934, his father claimed in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland at Stormont that there had been a plot to kidnap the young John Brooke by Irish Republicans during Sir Basil Brooke&#x27;s time as Commandant of the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC). This report led Sir Basil (as he then was) to dismiss every Catholic worker in his employ, for which he was accused of sectarianism.

==Political career==
As Captain John Brooke, he was elected to Fermanagh County Council for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in 1947, serving until 1973, and was Chairman of the council from 1961 to 1973. He was appointed High Sheriff of Fermanagh for 1955. He succeeded his father as the UUP Stormont MP for Lisnaskea in a by-election on 22 March 1968. He retained that seat until the abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1973.

Brookeborough (when he was still Captain Brooke) was a member of a dissident group of Ulster Unionist backbench MPs who campaigned for the removal of Terence O&#x27;Neill as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. When O&#x27;Neill finally resigned in April 1969 his successor, Major James Chichester-Clark, brought some of this dissident group into his government. Capt. Brooke was made Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Commerce (1969–1970), and then Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of the Prime Minister (1970–1972). Under Brian Faulkner&#x27;s premiership, he was Government Chief Whip (1971–1972) and also served in the Cabinet from 1971 as Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance.

In the Northern Ireland Assembly (1973–74) he represented North Down. When the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (UPNI) was founded by pro-Sunningdale Agreement members of the UUP, Brooke joined in 1974 and was again elected for North Down to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention (1975–76). He also represented the views of the UPNI in the House of Lords from 1973.

At 5:13pm on 28 March 1972, Capt. Brooke delivered the final speech from the dispatch box in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland at Stormont prior to the of the Parliament of Northern Ireland by Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservative government. In it, he quoted from a poem by Rudyard Kipling entitled &quot;Ulster&quot;, written in 1914, about the time his father&#x27;s involvement in Ulster loyalism might be said to have begun. It ended:

 &quot;Before an empire&#x27;s eyes the traitor claims his price.&lt;br&gt;
 What need of further lies? We are the sacrifice.&quot;

==Family==
Lord Brookeborough married Rosemary Chichester, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur O&#x27;Neill Cubitt Chichester, of Galgorm Castle, County Antrim, in 1949. They had five children: Alan, Christopher, Juliana, Melinda, and Susanna. Rosemary, Lady Brookeborough, died in January 2007. She had lived at Ashbrooke House, the dower house on the family&#x27;s Colebrooke Estate near Brookeborough in County Fermanagh, for many years.

<doc id="1138860" wikidata="Q6540945" url="?curid=1138860" title="Liberalism in the Philippines">
<text>Liberalism in the Philippines first emerged during Spanish rule, along with broader liberal developments within Spain. The ideology became prominent among an educated group known as the &quot;ilustrado&quot;, including the author José Rizal, whose writing contained liberal themes. Liberal ideas were adopted by the nationalistic Philippine Revolution, and later co-opted by the American administration. Liberalism became popular under American rule, which saw the creation of the Liberal Party of the Philippines, one of the oldest parties in the Philippines. This elite ideology became contested following independence. The lack of progress on economic inequality led to a communist insurgency. Liberal democracy was further challenged by the establishment of Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos. A return to liberal democracy following the People Power Revolution was upturned by the rule of Rodrigo Duterte.

== History ==

=== Spanish tenure ===

The 19th century saw the rise of liberalism in Spain, culminating in the Spanish Constitution of 1812. This constitution even included the representation of the Philippines within the Cortes of Cádiz. However, this representation was short-lived. The promises of liberalism in Spain were never fully implemented in the Philippines, where the powers of the state and church increased rather than decreased. The promise of equality under the law for all Spanish citizens in particular was never achieved, with non-peninsulares not being granted equality with native Spaniards in a racially segmented Spanish Empire.

Luis Rodríguez-Varela, a writer in the Philippines of European descent, sometimes known as &quot;El Conde Filipino&quot;, began releasing books espousing a liberal view in 1799. These views were inspired by the French Revolution, and Varela later became a supporter of the 1812 constitution. He sought its full implementation of the constitution in the Philippines, along with representation for the Philippines in the Spanish Cortes. He also called for a school system independent of the church. Varela&#x27;s views circulated among others of Spanish descent living in Manila, and the spread of these views eventually led to the creation of the Comite de Reformadores of 1869, the first Liberal political party in the country. Famous members include José Burgos, while the youth wing in the University of Santo Tomas included Felipe Buencamino and Paciano Rizal. The party was suppressed by the government following the 1872 Cavite mutiny. Some members went on to become members of the &quot;ilustrado&quot;, and the liberal ideas were revived through the Propaganda Movement.

Members of the &quot;Ilustrado&quot;, including those in the Propaganda Movement, sought reform of the governance of the Philippines and a curtailing of Catholic power. In particular, they called for an end to racial discrimination, and thus the full application of Spanish law in the Philippines, which would provide full rights to those in the Philippines as Spanish citizens with full representation in the Spanish Cortes.

The most prominent &quot;ilustrado&quot; was José Rizal. Rizal&#x27;s novel &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; features a figure named Elias, who espoused secular and liberal beliefs that conflicted with reactionary beliefs regarding overbearing civil and religious authorities. Rizal remained more religious than many liberal thinkers in Spain proper, treating liberal freedoms as natural results of God&#x27;s justice.

Liberal thought represented a powerful challenge to the conservative colonial governing structures. The &quot;ilustrado&quot; were Spanish-speaking and university-educated and desired assimilation into the mainstream of Spanish society. These political aspirations caused conflict with the influential friars in the Philippines, and the state generally sided with the religious authorities. Rizal wrote that &quot;modern ideas&quot; were &quot;asphyxiated upon touching the shores of Manila&quot;. Liberal thought thus formed the core of a nascent nationalist movement, with the ideas of Rizal and other &quot;ilustrado&quot; being espoused by the nationalist &quot;Katipunan&quot; group.

=== American tenure ===
During American rule, liberalism was a key component of state-building, with many liberals promoted to important positions in the administration. Rizal&#x27;s legacy was adopted by American authorities, who positioned him as espousing peaceful reforms that American rule had brought. While common among the elite in Filipino politics, liberal philosophy did not spread far within the economically unequal wider society, where Catholic conservatism competed with socialist movements. Beginning in the 1920s, the Filipino elite began to travel to the United States, becoming more familiar with American liberal ideas and the concept of a liberal democracy.

=== Early independence ===
Liberalism was the dominant ideology of the political elite upon independence. Nationalist historians have sometimes drew a distinction between the liberal ideas of the &quot;ilustrado&quot; and the ideals of the revolutionaries. 20th-century Filipino critics such as Renato Constantino and Jose Maria Sison viewed Rizal&#x27;s writings as elite and bourgeoisie, believing his ideas of reform were unambitious compared to nationalist figures with whom Rizal disagreed.

=== Martial law ===
Broadly liberal rule was ended by the Presidency of Ferdinand Marcos. Ferdinand Marcos implemented martial law, justifying the move as necessary to combat the communist New People&#x27;s Army rebellion as well as elite oligarchic families. The language and justification was couched in liberal ideals, although in practice they served as a means to maintain power. The Liberal Party developed to become a political opponent of the Marcos regime. A revolution driven in part by the urban Manila middle-class, named the People Power Revolution, ended the Marcos regime and reestablished a liberal democratic political system.

=== Duterte regime ===
The 2016 Philippine presidential election was run by populist Rodrigo Duterte, a dark horse candidate who campaigned on the failures of the existing political system to achieve change. This election followed the presidency of Benigno Aquino III, son of the first post-Marcos president Corazon Aquino, allowing for a strong link to be created against the Aquinos and their liberal democratic tradition. The ideology underlying Duterte&#x27;s presidency became known as &quot;Dutertismo&quot;, and was opposed by Liberalists and Catholic priests; the regime was also opposed following allegations of mass murder. The populist rule of Duterte came into conflict with institutions and ideas associated with liberal democracy, such as liberal conceptions of a free press and human rights, although it maintained broadly liberal economic policies.

==Relationship to debate==
In the early 20th century, debating groups developed in the Philippines among those who held liberal beliefs. This was seen as a role to prove to Americans that Filipinos were responsible citizens, and liberal ideas were deployed to argue for the Philippines&#x27; independence. Prominent liberal figures involved in debating included educator Camilo Osías and diplomat Carlos P. Romulo.

<doc id="1138868" wikidata="Q1547617" url="?curid=1138868" title="Triumph 1500">
<text>The Triumph 1500 is a small front-wheel drive car that was produced by Standard-Triumph from 1970 to 1973. In 1973 it was revised as the Triumph 1500TC becoming rear-wheel drive. Production ended in 1976, by which time it had been replaced by the Triumph Dolomite.

== 1500 ==
Whilst retaining the front-wheel drive of the Triumph 1300, the body featured a restyled nose, a lengthened tail, twin headlights, horizontally mounted rear light clusters and a larger boot. The interior was also restyled featuring a new design of dashboard and door cards but retaining the wooden door cappings. The size of the Standard SC engine was increased to with a single SU carburettor and had a power output of . The suspension used coil springs all round and was independent at the front, incorporating a dead-beam rear axle at the back, which represented something of a technological retreat from the all-independent suspension offered by the 1300. In 1972 the power output was increased to with an uprated carburettor and inlet manifold. These later cars also had a silver nose badge. Earlier cars had a black nose badge.

The car was capable of reaching a top speed of and could accelerate from 0–60 mph in 16.5 seconds.
== 1500TC ==
In October 1973, the 1500 was renamed the 1500TC. It retained the same 1493 cc engine (now with twin SU carburettors) mated to the rear wheel drive drivetrain from the recently introduced Triumph Dolomite. The interior and exterior styling remained largely the same. The 1500TC can be identified by the &quot;1500TC&quot; bootlid badge and the black centres on the wheel trims, which were blue on the 1500.

The 1500TC was replaced by the Dolomite 1500/1500HL in March 1976.

The car was capable of reaching a top speed of 92 mph (148 km/h) and could accelerate from 0–60 mph in 14.0 seconds (0–100 km/h in 14.8 seconds).

A sunroof option was available.

<doc id="1138873" wikidata="Q1150623" url="?curid=1138873" title="Come and Get It (1936 film)">
<text>Come and Get It is a 1936 American lumberjack drama film directed by Howard Hawks and William Wyler. The screenplay by Jane Murfin and Jules Furthman is based on the 1935 novel of the same title by Edna Ferber.

For his performance as Swan Bostrom, Walter Brennan became the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Plot==
Ruthless lumberjack foreman Barney Glasgow (Edward Arnold) will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, to someday become the head of the logging industry in 19th century Wisconsin. His determination to succeed leads him to end his relationship with saloon singer Lotta Morgan (Frances Farmer) and marry Emma Louise Hewitt (Mary Nash), the daughter of his boss Jed Hewett (Charles Halton), in order to secure a partnership in his business.

Over two decades later, a wealthy and successful Barney and Emma Louise&#x27;s son Richard (Joel McCrea) strongly objects to his father&#x27;s practice of destroying forests without planting new trees. Barney visits his old friend Swan Bostrom (Walter Brennan), who married Lotta when Barney rejected her. Swan is now a widower raising a daughter, also named Lotta (also played by Frances Farmer), who bears a striking resemblance to her mother. Barney finds himself attracted to the girl and, foolishly hoping to recapture the love he abandoned as a young man, offers to finance her education. Complications arise when Richard meets Lotta and takes a strong interest in her, which is reciprocated, much to Barney&#x27;s displeasure and jealousy.

==Production==
Samuel Goldwyn paid $150,000 for the screen rights to the Edna Ferber novel, who sold it to him confident he understood she had intended it to be &quot;primarily a story of the rape of America . . . by the wholesale robber barons of that day.&quot; Goldwyn was attracted to the melodramatic &quot;Barbary Coast&quot;-like aspects of the story, which prompted him to hire that film&#x27;s director, Howard Hawks, to bring &quot;Come and Get It&quot; to the screen. He also was intrigued by the fact Hawks&#x27; grandfather had served as the basis for the character of Barney Glasgow. Ferber had approved Jane Murfin&#x27;s script, which Hawks found wanting, and he persuaded her and Goldwyn to allow him to bring in Jules Furthman to work on a rewrite.

Goldwyn announced Miriam Hopkins would play the dual roles of Lotta Morgan and Lotta Bostrom, but Hawks was not happy with his choice. He looked at numerous screen tests of aspiring starlets and finally settled on Andrea Leeds, who previously had played minor or uncredited roles in a handful of films. Eventually he replaced her with the even less experienced Frances Farmer and cast Leeds in the supporting role of Evvie Glasgow, Richard&#x27;s younger sister, instead. Goldwyn tried to borrow Spencer Tracy from MGM for the lead role of Barney Glasgow, but Louis B. Mayer refused to let him work for his chief rival, so contract player Edward Arnold was assigned the role.

Soon after filming began, Goldwyn underwent two major surgeries that incapacitated him for a lengthy period of time, keeping him away from the studio and the daily rushes. Hawks took advantage of the situation and allowed Furthman to change completely the tone of Ferber&#x27;s original story; cast slender Walter Brennan as Swan Bostrom, a man Ferber had described as &quot;the strongest man in the North woods;&quot; and arrange a shooting schedule and budget Goldwyn never would have approved.

Upon returning to the studio, Goldwyn viewed a rough cut of the film and was shocked to discover Hawks had shifted the focus from the unbridled destruction of the land to a love triangle in which brawling Barney Glasgow and Swan Bostrom vied for the affections of lusty Lotta Morgan. The character of Richard Glasgow, intended to be the second lead, barely was in the film, which was cluttered with Hawks-like improvised bits of business. When the director refused to comply with Goldwyn&#x27;s demands for major changes, the producer fired Hawks from the project.

William Wyler had begun post-production work on &quot;Dodsworth&quot; when he was summoned to Goldwyn&#x27;s home and told he would be completing &quot;Come and Get It&quot;. Wyler was loath to take over a film started by someone else, but Goldwyn threatened him with suspension if he refused to accept the assignment. He did so reluctantly, and in later years he recalled, &quot;I was talked into doing it, and I&#x27;ve been sorry about that ever since. The picture wasn&#x27;t very good.&quot; Wyler spent two weeks filming what amounted to about the final third of the completed film. He strongly objected to Goldwyn&#x27;s desire to give him sole directing credit, and preferred his name not be attached to the film at all. He finally relented but only when Goldwyn agreed to give Hawks top billing. Wyler never considered &quot;Come and Get It&quot; a part of his filmography and disowned it whenever he could, although it greatly pleased Ferber, who praised Goldwyn &quot;for the courage, sagacity, and power of decision&quot; he demonstrated by &quot;throwing out the finished Hawks picture and undertaking the gigantic task of making what amounted to a new picture.&quot;

Exterior scenes were filmed along the North Fork Clearwater River in Idaho.

The soundtrack includes &quot;Aura Lea&quot; by George R. Poulton and W. W. Fosdick and &quot;The Bird on Nellie&#x27;s Hat&quot; by Alfred Solman and Arthur J. Lamb.

==Adaptations==
Edward Arnold and Walter Brennan reprised their respective roles of Barney Glasgow and Swan Bostrom in two radio adaptations of the Ferber novel. The first aired as a one-hour production on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on November 15, 1937, and the second was a half-hour version broadcast by &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; on March 15, 1942.

==Critical reception==
Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt compressing Ferber&#x27;s saga spanning fifty years into the story of a single generation &quot;arrested the panoramic sweep of the story, converting it from a mural of the American scene into a vividly toned portrait of a man. But the transformation is readily excusable, for Barney was the heart of the novel and we felt it had stopped beating when he died.&quot; He added, &quot;Although there is nothing new in the theme, it has been simply and powerfully expressed by a number of admirable performances, and it has been played against an interesting background. There are several extraordinarily graphic scenes of logging operations, the atmosphere of the late Eighties and early Nineties has been reproduced handsomely in the settings and costumes and . . . it never fails to reward your attention. There&#x27;s nothing static about this one, thanks to Howard Hawks and William Wyler, the directors; to Gregg Toland&#x27;s photography, and to the work of a uniformly fine cast.&quot; He concluded, &quot;You won&#x27;t find &quot;Come and Get It&quot; a thoroughly Ferber work, but enough of her has been retained and enough good Goldwyn added to make it a genuinely satisfying picture.&quot;

British Channel 4 observed, &quot;It&#x27;s a minor Hawks, to be sure, and the action does tend to lag at times, but the fine performances from Farmer, Brennan and McCrea are what make it.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
For his performance, Walter Brennan became the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Edward Curtiss was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing but lost to Ralph Dawson for &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot;.

<doc id="1138876" wikidata="Q263629" url="?curid=1138876" title="Maria Cebotari">
<text>Maria Cebotari (original name: Ciubotaru, 10 February 1910 – 9 June 1949) was a Bessarabian-Romanian lyric coloratura soprano. She was widely known as a singer by the mid 1930s and noted in particular for her wide range of repertoire.

Beniamino Gigli stated that Cebotari was one of the greatest female voices he had ever heard. Maria Callas was compared to her, and Angela Gheorghiu named Maria Cebotari among the artists she admires the most.

With thousands of people in attendance, her funeral was &quot;one of the most imposing demonstrations of love and honor any deceased artist has ever received&quot; in the history of Vienna.

==Biography==

Cebotari was born in Chişinău, Bessarabia, and studied singing at the Chişinău Conservatory in 1910. In 1929, she joined the Moscow Art Theater Company as an actress. Shortly after, she married the company&#x27;s leader, Alexander Virubov.

She soon moved to Berlin with the company and studied singing with Oskar Daniel for three months. She made her debut as an operatic singer as Mimi in &quot;La Bohème&quot; at Dresden Semperoper on 15 March 1931. Bruno Walter invited her to the Salzburg Festival, where she sang Euridice in Gluck&#x27;s opera &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;.

In 1935, she sang the part of Aminta in the world premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27; opera &quot;Die Schweigsame Frau&quot; under Karl Böhm at Dresden Semper Opera House. Strauss advised her to move to Berlin, and in 1936 she joined the Berlin State Opera, where she was a prima donna until 1946. That year, she sang Susanna in &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot;, Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and Sophie in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; for the Dresden Semper Opera Company&#x27;s performances at Covent Garden Royal Opera House of London. Cebotari appeared at many opera houses, including the Vienna State Opera and La Scala Opera House of Milan.

In 1938, she divorced Virubov and married the Austrian actor Gustav Diessl, with whom she had two sons. In 1946, she left Berlin and joined the Vienna State Opera House. The next year, she revisited Covent Garden with the Vienna State Opera Company and sang Salome, Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni,&quot; and Countess Almaviva in &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot;. On September 27 of that year, she was Donna Anna to the Ottavio of Richard Tauber, in his final stage appearance less than a week before his cancerous left lung was removed.

In early 1949, she suffered severe pain during the performance of &quot;Le Nozze di Figaro&quot; at La Scala Opera House. At first, doctors did not consider it serious. However, on 31 March 1949, she collapsed during the performance of Karl Millöcker&#x27;s operetta &quot;Der Bettelstudent&quot; in Vienna. During surgery on 4 April, doctors found cancer in her liver and pancreas. She died from cancer on 9 June 1949 in Vienna. British pianist Clifford Curzon and his wife Lucille Wallace adopted her two sons.

Cebotari had a versatile voice; her repertoire covered coloratura, soubrette, lyric, and dramatic roles, as is illustrated in her performance history. She concentrated on four composers: Mozart, Richard Strauss, Verdi, and Puccini. Richard Strauss described her as &quot;the best all-rounder on the European stage, and she is never late, and she never cancels&quot;. During a BBC interview decades after her death, Herbert von Karajan said she was the greatest &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; he had ever conducted.

==Films==
Along with her successful career at the opera houses, Cebotari appeared in several operatic films, such as &quot;Verdi&#x27;s Three Women&quot;, &quot;Maria Malibran&quot;, and &quot;The Dream of Madame Butterfly&quot;.

Cebotari also was cast in the film &quot;Odessa in fiamme&quot; (&quot;Odessa in Flames&quot;) in 1942, directed by Italian director Carmine Gallone with the script by Nicolae Kiriţescu. The movie is a fascist propaganda film about the Battle of Odessa, which was won by Romanian and Nazi troops. The Romanian-Italian co-production won at the Festival of Venice in 1942. 
In the film, Cebotari plays the role of Maria Teodorescu, an opera singer from Bessarabia, in Chisinau with her eight-year-old son at the time of the invasion. Her husband fights as a captain in the Romanian army in Bucharest, and her son is taken. Teodorescu is informed that her son will be kept in a camp and trained to be a Soviet man. Teodorescu consents to perform Russian music in theatres and taverns in exchange for her son&#x27;s return. By chance, her spouse discovers her photo, and the family gets back together.

&quot;Odessa in Flames&quot; was banned after Soviet troops reached Bucharest. [&quot;&quot;] The film was later rediscovered in the Cinecittà archives in Rome,[&quot;&quot;] where it was screened for the first time in years in Romania in December 2006.

Director Vlad Druc&#x27;s documentary &quot;Aria&quot; (2005) about the life of Maria Cebotari faced difficulties when screening in Moldova during the Communist administration (which ended in 2009). This was due to a part in the movie where the soprano self-identifies as Romanian, contrary to the official policy of the Communist government that called the ethnic majority Moldovan.

==Recordings==

Many of her surviving recordings are from live performances, either in opera houses or radio broadcasts. Almost all have now been digitally remastered.

<doc id="1138884" wikidata="Q2001756" url="?curid=1138884" title="Football hooliganism">
<text>Football hooliganism, also known as soccer hooliganism, football rioting or soccer rioting, constitutes violence and other destructive behaviors perpetrated by spectators at association football events. Football hooliganism typically involves conflict between pseudo-tribes, formed to intimidate and attack supporters of other teams. Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called local derbies) can be more severe. Conflict may arise at any point, before, during or after matches and occasionally outside of game situations. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets. In extreme cases, hooligans, police and bystanders have been killed, and riot police have intervened. Hooligan-led violence has been called &quot;aggro&quot; (short for &quot;aggression&quot;) and &quot;bovver&quot; (the Cockney pronunciation of &quot;bother&quot;, i.e. trouble).

Hooligans who have the time and money may follow national teams to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team. They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public. While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance.
== Behavior ==

Hooliganism can create a high level of violence at football matches. Outside of the physical violence, the behavior of these fans is extremely in-orderly and leads to conflict breaking out. In some cases, hooliganism involves extreme ideological pathways such as Neo-Nazism or white supremacism. These extreme beliefs which they take on can further invigorate the violence. Hooligans intentions are usually not focused on the match itself, despite club rivalries or pride often justifying the violence. They engage in behavior that risks them being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium, ejected from the stadium during the match or banned from attending future matches. Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific section (called an &quot;end&quot; in England) of their team&#x27;s stadium, and sometimes they include the section&#x27;s name in the name of their group.

=== Differences with ultras and alcohol-driven conflicts ===

In other parts of Europe and the world these groups are known as Ultras, in Hispanic America as &quot;Barra Bravas&quot; and Brazil as &quot;Torcidas Organizadas&quot;. However, it is important to not mix up hooligans with these as they do not necessarily depict violence in the same manner as hooliganism. These are Supporters&#x27; groups with the primary objective of fanatically supporting the club through chants, flags, displays and organizing trips to away games. Due their fanaticism, many of those groups frequently become embroiled with hooliganism, but do not have the explicit objective of causing violence.

=== Violence ===
The type of violence committed by hooligans can come in a number of forms: starting fires, unarmed and armed fighting, hateful speech, and occasionally even violent acts committed against the players such as throwing bottles or bananas to physically harm or racially attack players.

In 2014 in a match between Barcelona and Villareal, a fan racially abused Dani Alves, the Barcelona right back, throwing a banana at him, insinuating he was a monkey, a known racial stereotype against black people.

Violence can also come as a result of a player&#x27;s poor performance. Fans and in particular hooligans hold their mistakes to them, ridiculing them in any way possible. Andres Escobar was a Colombian defender whose own goal error lead to the elimination of Colombia in the 1994 World Cup. Subsequently, he was murdered.

==== Match-day ====
A study from the university of Munich analyzed violent crime in Germany from 2011 to 2015 and how much of that can be attributed to football. It found that on the day of the game, violent crime increased by 17% and during major rivalry games, violent crimes increased by 63%.

==Early history==
The first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the modern game allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when gangs of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after Preston North End beat Aston Villa 5–0 in a friendly match, both teams were pelted with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as &quot;howling roughs&quot;. The following year, Preston fans fought Queen&#x27;s Park fans in a railway station—the first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were tried for hooliganism, including a &quot;drunk and disorderly&quot; 70-year-old woman, following their match against Blackburn Rovers.

Although instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its history(e.g. Millwall&#x27;s ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media&#x27;s attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in Latin American football. In the 1955–56 English football season, Liverpool and Everton fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label &quot;football hooliganism&quot; first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s, leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this, in turn, created a &#x27;moral panic&#x27; out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.

==Causes==
One of the main aspects to examine when trying to understand the root of hooligan violence is about the characteristics of sports teams. Chanting, flags, and ties to the team&#x27;s area provide a base for &quot;local patriotism&quot;, and thus, give way to the unnamed groups and organizations that hooligans identify with. This can expand to a national level, as seen in the case of the UEFA Euro 2016 riots caused by several countries&#x27; visiting fans as well as the French host fans. The violence at these tournaments can be amplified due to an increased degree of &quot;patriotism&quot;.

Football hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called &quot;ritualized male violence&quot;. Sports Studies scholars Paul Gow and Joel Rookwood at Liverpool Hope University found in a 2008 study that &quot;Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter&#x27;s sense of identity.&quot; In relation to the Heysel Stadium disaster one study from 1986 claimed that alcohol, irregular tickets sales, the disinterest of the organisers and the &quot;&#x27;cowardly ineptitude&#x27;&quot; of the police had led to the tragedy. Gow and Rookwood&#x27;s 2008 study, which used interviews with British football hooligans found that while some identified structural social and physiological causes (e.g. aggression produces violent reactions) most interviewees claimed that media reports (especially in newspapers) and the police&#x27;s handling of hooligan related events were the main causes of hooliganism. 

Political reasons may also play in part in hooliganism, especially if there is a political undertone to such a match (e.g. unfriendly nations facing each other). Other deep division undertones in a match such as religion, ethnic, and class play a part as well in hooliganism.

As an attempt to explain the hooliganism phenomena in Brazil, Nepomuceno and other scholars at Federal University of Pernambuco have assessed 1363 hooligan incidents before and after an alcohol sanction enforced during 8 years. While alcohol presented low evidence of contribution to the incidents of violence, the knockout phases, finals, competitiveness (derby matches), small score boundaries and the pride levels were some of the potentials for the violence among sports spectators. Months after the work being conducted, the State Legislature of Pernambuco decided to abolish the sanction to allow alcohol intake in stadiums. Writing for the BBC in 2013, David Bond stated that in the UK,

== Effects ==
=== Anti-hooligan measures ===
The violence perpetrated by hooligans is somewhat of a dying phenomenon although experiencing some surges around 2015. The mid-1900s was when hooliganism was at its highest rate, however, police and clubs themselves have taken strides to prevent the level of hooliganism, and today, violence at games has decreased significantly not only in the amount that&#x27;s taking place, but in the level of the conflict as well.

One example of anti-hooligan measures are some of the new rules that stadiums have put in place regarding alcohol. Some stadiums do not allow fans to bring their alcoholic drinks up to their seats; they are only permitted to the lower levels near the concessions. In addition, bottles are typically plastic, as to avoid the threat of fans hurling them at other fans or even players. In some cases, specifically in major tournaments, more extreme measures have to be put in place to help reduce the chances of violence. For example, at the 2016 Euros, officials recommended a complete ban on alcohol. In the event that violence results in riots that go out of control, police utilize tools like tear gas and water cannons in an attempt on crowd control. This can sometimes lead to increased violence from the hooligans.

==Europe==


===Belgium===
Despite Belgian football hooliganism peaking from the 80s to the 90s, it did not disappear even after the establishment of stringent anti-hooligan measures by police and governments. Fights inside the stadium are growing rare, but have changed slowly and morphed into organized fights in the wilderness and nearby cities. Royal Antwerp, Beerschot, Club Brugge and Anderlecht are notorious for hooligan fanbases. Other teams known for having violent supporters include Standard Liège, Charleroi and Racing Genk.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Football hooliganism in Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as FK Sarajevo (Horde Zla), FK Željezničar Sarajevo (The Maniacs), FK Velež Mostar (Red Army), HŠK Zrinjski Mostar (Ultrasi) and FK Borac Banja Luka (Lešinari). Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include FK Sloboda Tuzla (Fukare), NK Čelik Zenica (Robijaši) and NK Široki Brijeg (Škripari).

Many fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as the Ustaše and the Nazis.

In 2009, riots between supports of Bosnian Premier League club sides NK Široki Brijeg and FK Sarajevo left Horde Zla supporter Vedran Puljić (from Sarajevo) dead from a gunshot wound.

Hooliganism has also been present in lower leagues. Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there.

===Bulgaria===
A 2019 Euro qualifying match between Bulgaria and England was suspended twice to remove fans that had been taunting black English players. Raheem Sterling said that he had heard masked groups making monkey sounds and performing Nazi salutes and throwing objects onto the pitch. After the match Bulgarian police officers were called in to escort the English fans to the safety of their hotels protecting them from the hooligans that had been removed earlier on during the match.

===Croatia===
Football hooliganism in Croatia has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the Yugoslav federation in the 1990s. Two of the best known hooligan firms are Torcida (Hajduk Split) and Bad Blue Boys (Dinamo Zagreb).

On 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia), Serbian club Red Star Belgrade was in Zagreb to play Dinamo Zagreb at the Maksimir Stadium. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organised supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with armoured vehicles and water cannons, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo&#x27;s player Zvonimir Boban kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo&#x27;s fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured.

Ethnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, Sydney United (who have a large Croatian following and were established by Croatian immigrants) and Bonnyrigg White Eagles (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the New South Wales Premier League. About 500 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. Football NSW held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or that there was any ethnic rivalry.

Croatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.

Another incident occurred in Genoa in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made Nazi salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in Osijek during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and Kohorta occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones.

A large riot occurred in 2008 in Prague prior to the Sparta Prague-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta&#x27;s ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić. Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre, breaking into shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and eight police officers were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local Romani people by giving Nazi salutes.

A large riot occurred on 1 May 2010 at the Maksimir stadium when the Bad Blue Boys clashed with the police resulting in many arrests and one critically injured police officer. After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the FC Timişoara-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident Romanian police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the FC Timişoara stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash, Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at FC Timişoara fans resulting in severe injuries.

In December 2010, 10–15 Tornado (Zadar) hooligans attacked a Partizan traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010, 30–40 Bad Blue Boys hooligans attacked a PAOK traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers.

In November 2014, during a Euro 2016 qualifying game in Milan, Italy, hooligans from Croatia threw flares and fireworks onto the field and the game had to be briefly suspended.

In August 2023, an AEK Athens fan was stabbed to death when around 100 Dinamo Zagreb hooligans clashed with local fans in one of the city&#x27;s suburbs. The two sides of supporters attacked one another near the AEK stadium, throwing stun grenades, stones, incendiary devices and other objects. Police made 96 arrests throughout the night until the early hours of the morning. 102 Croatian fans were charged by the police who suspect links with the &#x27;Bad Blue Boys,&#x27; hard-line supporters of Dinamo Zagreb.

===Cyprus===
Football hooliganism in Cyprus has been an issue for the past few decades and incidents are generally associated with the 5 major Cypriot clubs.

Anorthosis Famagusta FC fans have been involved in many incidents on most occasions involving their ultras group &quot;Mahites&quot;. The two clubs in Limassol, AEL Limassol and Apollon Limassol have also been involved in numerous incidents, especially in recent years.

Supporters of APOEL FC and AC Omonia Nicosia, the two most successful and most popular clubs in the country are notorious for hooliganism. The most violent cases of hooliganism in Cyprus usually involve the two teams. In May 2009 APOEL fans entered the Omonia stand and engaged in fistfights with Omonia fans eventually throwing one down the stand stairs. 6 months later in November fans of the two teams clashed close to the GSP Stadium when APOEL fans tried to hijack a futsal tournament organized by Omonia. Many were injured including an APOEL fan who was almost beaten to death.

The rivalry between Omonia and APOEL has its roots in politics. APOEL fans are in their majority right wing whereas Omonia fans tend to be left wing. Communist symbols in the Omonia stand and right wing or even fascist symbols in the APOEL stand are not uncommon. The Limassol rivalry between Apollon and AEL Limassol is more a matter of what team dominates over the city. Hooliganism in the case of Anorthosis is also politically linked, especially when the club plays a left wing team such as Omonia. Other incidents between clubs of different cities that are of the same political orientation are associated with intercity rivalries, particularly when a club from Limassol faces a club from Nicosia.

===France===

Football hooliganism in France is often rooted in social conflict, including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland. There is a long-standing north–south rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and Olympique de Marseille (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent when a Marseille fan was seriously injured by a projectile.

On 24 May 2001, fifty people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between PSG and Turkish club Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium. PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500. In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.

On 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4–2 to Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv at the Parc des Prince in a UEFA Cup match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-Semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches. The fan who was shot, was linked with the &quot;Boulogne Boys&quot;, a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group&#x27;s name comes from the Kop of Boulogne (KOB), one of the two main home fan stands at the Parc des Princes.

The KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan. They cited bias in the French press who had only given a &quot;one-sided&quot; account of the incident. French President Jacques Chirac condemned violence that led up to the shooting, stating that he was horrified by the reports of racism and anti-Semitism. French Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin called for new, tougher measures to deal with football hooligans. Prosecutors opened an inquiry into the incident, to determine whether the officer involved should face criminal charges. Before a home match against Sochaux on 4 January 2006, two Arab youths were punched and kicked by white fans outside the entrance to the KOB. During the match racist insults were aimed at black players and a PSG player of Indian origin, Vikash Dhorasoo was told to &quot;go sell peanuts in the metro&quot;. In the recent years, following UK&#x27;s example, France&#x27;s legislation has changed, including more and more banning of violent fans from stadiums. The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium.

On 11 June 2016, during a Euro 2016 match in Marseille between Russia and England, violent conflict broke out between the fans and left 35 injured. Both threw numerous items at each other and engaged in physical combat. Even a person who is recording the incident can be seen stomping another person&#x27;s head. Because of this, both countries were given a disqualification warning soon after. The match ended with 1–1.

On 16 April 2017, during a match between Olympique Lyonnais and SC Bastia, supporters of SC Bastia invaded the pitch in an attempt to fight Lyonnais players. The match was then postponed.

September 2022 saw OGC Nice and 1. FC Köln fans clash outside and inside the Nice stadium, which delayed the start by 55 minutes, 39 were injured with around 50 Cologne fans attacking the home end throwing pyrotechnics.

In 2022 there was chaos at the UEFA Champions League final with dozens of arrests and hundreds of injuries, mainly to Liverpool fans who were locked out of the stadium and being attacked by Parisian gangs. French police did not go to their assistance, and instead also attacked the fans and then blamed them for the situation. A UEFA report blamed UEFA for poor security and French police for being heavy handed in attacking, rather than defending, the Liverpool fans.

The 18-year old supporter of FC Berlin Mike Polley was killed by several shots fired by police in Leipzig during clashes between supporters of FC Berlin and police before the match between FC Sachsen Leipzig and FC Berlin on 3 November 1990. In June 1998, after a FIFA World Cup match in France between Germany and Yugoslavia a French policeman was beaten to the point of brain damage by German fans. Following the incident, German police contacted many of the known 2,000+ German hooligans to warn them they would be arrested if they traveled to upcoming matches in France. A German fan was arrested in 1998 and charged with attempted murder and in 1999, four more Germans were convicted in the attack. The main defendant, Andre Zawacki, was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to ten years in jail. The other three defendants were convicted of grievous bodily harm and given jail sentences of between six months and three-and-a-half years. In 2001, Markus Warnecke, the German fan who was accused of leading the attack, was found guilty and jailed for five years and banned from France for ten years, and from all sports facilities for five years.

 Some football hooliganism in Germany has been linked to neo-Nazism and far right groups. In March 2005, German football fans fought with police and rival fans at a friendly match between Germany and Slovenia in Celje, Slovenia, damaging cars and shops, and shouting racist slogans. The German Football Association (DFB) apologised for the behaviour. As a result, 52 people were arrested; 40 Germans and 12 Slovenians. Following a 2–0 defeat to Slovakia in Bratislava, Slovakia, German hooligans fought with the local police, and six people were injured and two were taken into custody. The DFB again apologised for fans who chanted racist slogans.

In June 2006, Germany beat Poland in a World Cup match in Dortmund, which led to violent clashes. The police detained over 300 people in Dortmund and German fans threw chairs, bottles and fireworks at the police. Of the 300 arrested, 120 were known hooligans. In October 2006, a task force was established to deal with violence and racism in German football stadiums. President of the DFB Theo Zwanziger and president of Bundesliga Werner Hackmann held a crisis meeting following violence at several German lower-division matches. The worst incident took place at a Third division (North) match between the Hertha BSC Berlin B-team and Dynamo Dresden, in which 23 policemen were injured. Dynamo Dresden fans tried to invade the pitch, and threw missiles (including gas cartridges and plastic seats) at police. The police responded with batons and pepper spray. At a Second Division match between FC Augsburg and 1860 Munich, 21 people were arrested and police used pepper spray to disperse fans. In addition, 70 amateur and youth matches in Siegen-Wittgenstein were called off when referees refused to take to the pitch, fearing for their safety. In February 2007 in Saxony, all German lower league matches, from the fifth division downward were cancelled after about 800 fans attacked 300 police officers (injuring 39 of them) after a match between Lokomotive Leipzig and Erzgebirge Aue II.
There were minor disturbances after the Germany and England match during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. An English flag was burned down amongst a mob of German supporters in Duisburg-Hamborn in Germany.

===Greece===
The first incidents between Football fans in Greece were recorded in June 1930, after the match between Aris and Panathinaikos at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving at the port of Piraeus from Thessaloniki, Olympiacos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8–2) by Panathinaikos rioted with the green fans. In 1962, after Panathinaikos and PAOK match incidents, newspapers wrote for the first time that hooligans vandalized Leoforos Alexandras Stadium. On 19 November 1966, a big flag at the 13th gate of Leoforos Alexandras Stadium announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. Gate 13 would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions. PAOK fans made Gate 4 in 1976 and Olympiacos fans created the Gate 7 in 1981, the same year that AEK Athens fans created the Original 21.

In 1982, in a match between Aris – PAOK, Aristidis Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki&#x27;s hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alcazar Stadium of Larissa, Charalambos Blionas, an AEL supporter, was killed by a flare pistol thrown by the PAOK fans. One month later Anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match AEK Athens and PAOK. In January 1991, before the derby of AEK Athens. and Olympiacos, George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nikos Goumas Stadium hit by flare pistol. On 10 April 1991, after the Greek Basketball Cup final between Panionios and PAOK in Piraeus, a car with PAOK supporters were violently attacked with an improvised molotov cocktail by unknown hooligans on Greek National Road 1. Two people burned alive and other two people were seriously injured, but they survived. The perpetrators were never found. On 15 May 2005, in Thessaloniki derby between Iraklis and Aris, Aris&#x27;s hooligans called &quot;SUPER 3&quot; invaded the pitch when the score was 2–1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and Aris was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the Second Division.

In April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in Greece for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in Athens on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival Super League Greece clubs Panathinaikos, which is based in Athens, and Olympiacos, which is based in nearby Piraeus. The Greek government immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters&#x27; organizations. A Third Division match between Panetolikos and Ilioupoli was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal. Two players and a coach were sent to the hospital.

On 18 April, rival fans clashed with each other and riot police in Ioannina during and after a Greek Cup semi-final match between local rivals PAS Giannena and AEL. There was trouble during the game in which AEL won 2–0. Fans set fire to rubbish bins and smashed shop windows, while police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas.

On 10 October 2009, a group of about 30 hooligans disrupted an under-17 match between the academies of local rivals PAOK and Aris. Among the injured were a group of Aris players and their coach, a veteran PAOK player and another official. On 7 October 2011, a group of Greece national football team supporters firebombed the away section of a Euro 2012 qualifying match against Croatia in Athens.
On 18 March 2012, during the match for the Super League in Athens Olympic Stadium between Panathinaikos and Olympiacos, home team Panathinaikos&#x27;s fans who were inside the stadium attacked police forces with Molotov bombs, causing extended damages to the stadium, while police forces were unable to keep peace.
On 5 January 2014, in Aigaleo, a suburb in Athens, the local team Aigaleo was hosting AEK Athens, a Third Division match. Before the match clashes broke up between AEK and Aigaleo fans. Indeed, the clashes resulted in the arrest of a security guard of the stadium who was accused of participating in the clashes among Aigaleo hooligans and also accused of committing attempted murder against an AEK fan.

On 15 September 2014, in Nea Alikarnassos, the team Herodotus was hosting Ethnikos Piraeus, a Third Division match. On 75&#x27; minute of the game, a clash between the supporters of the two clubs forced the referee to stop the match. During the clash, a 45-year-old supporter of Ethnikos Piraeus suffered a severe head injury and died two weeks later.

On 1 February 2022 an Aris fan was stabbed to death by PAOK hooligans in Charilaou district near the stadium of Aris in an attack against Aris&#x27; supporters. On July 6, 2023, it was announced that all defendants had been found guilty of manslaughter or accessory to murder, contrary to the original indictment of manslaughter (murder).

In December 2023, following a series of violent sport related incidents, Greece banned fans from watching all Super League 1 championship football games for two months, the ban can also be applied to home European games matches.

===Hungary===
Local derbies between Budapest teams Ferencvárosi Torna Club (based in Ferencváros) and Újpest FC (based in Újpest) are frequently occasions for violence between supporters. Other clubs whose supporters are reportedly involved in hooliganism include Debreceni VSC (Debrecen), Diósgyőri VTK (Miskolc), Nyíregyháza Spartacus FC (Nyíregyháza), Zalaegerszegi TE (Zalaegerszeg), Haladás VSE (Szombathely) and Videoton FC (Székesfehérvár).

===Ireland===
Incidents have been known to occur at games involving teams in Ireland. The most heated and well known derby in the League of Ireland is between Dublin rivals Shamrock Rovers F.C and Bohemian F.C. On 15 July 2019 a League of Ireland match was the scene of crowd trouble following a match between Dublin clubs UCD and Bohemians. Missiles were thrown from the crowd where the referee and players had to be escorted away.

===Italy===
The term &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; is used to describe hooligans in Italy. Italy&#x27;s ultras started in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as wannabe paramilitary groups, and gave themselves names such as Commandos, Guerrillas and Fedayeen. One group of Juventus&#x27; ultras are called Droogs (named after the violent types in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;). Every Italian club has its ultra gang and big clubs have dozens.

Rome is dubbed &quot;stab city&quot; by the British press due to the number of stabbings from ultras there. John Foot, a professor of modern Italian history at University College London and an author on Italian football states, &quot;They target the buttocks because the victim is not likely to die. They want to show they can hurt their rivals and get away with it.&quot; In 1984, ultras of A.S. Roma stabbed Liverpool fans in the aftermath of Liverpool winning the 1984 European Cup Final in Rome. In February 2001, Roma fans again stabbed Liverpool fans, and further knife attacks from Roma ultras include against fans of Middlesbrough (in 2006) and twice against Manchester United (2007 and 2009).

After a weekend of violence in January 2007, the president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) threatened to halt all league football. An official of amateur club Sammartinese died when he was caught up in a fight between players and fans in Luzzi, among numerous incidents of disorder in Florence, Bergamo and elsewhere. In February 2007, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) suspended all football matches after Police Officer Filippo Raciti was killed due to liver damage from blunt object trauma when football violence broke out at a Serie A match between Catania and Palermo.

Before the 2014 Coppa Italia Final in Rome between Napoli and Fiorentina, three Napoli fans were shot outside the stadium before the match, two with arm injuries. Ciro Esposito, who was in a critical state after being shot in the chest, died in hospital on 25 June. Police, who found the gun, have stated that they do not believe that the shootings were related to other clashes by the two sets of fans: prior to the game, there were reports of firecrackers and other projectiles being thrown between them in the Tor di Quinto area of Rome. Kick-off was subsequently delayed as Napoli fans did not want the match to start without knowing the condition of the shot fans. When match organisers attempted to speak to the Napoli fans, accompanied by their midfielder Marek Hamšík, they were &quot;pelted with flares and smoke bombs&quot;. Daniele De Santis, a Roma ultra was convicted of shooting Esposito and was sentenced to 26 years in prison on 24 May 2016; his sentenced was later reduced on appeals to 16 years on 26 September 2018.

===Montenegro===
In a Euro 2016 qualifying match in Podgorica on 27 March 2015, a few seconds in, a hooligan threw a flare at Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev injuring him. The match was then temporarily suspended. Later fighting between the teams and more hooliganism rendered the game abandoned.

In March 2019, during a Euro 2020 qualifying match between Montenegro and England, several England players including Danny Rose, Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi were allegedly subjected to monkey chants from Montenegro fans.

===Netherlands===
The earliest recorded case of hooliganism in the Netherlands occurred when Rotterdam club Feyenoord and English club Tottenham Hotspur met at the 1974 UEFA Cup Final, where Tottenham hooligans destroyed portions of the Feyenoord stadium tribunes. It was the first time the Netherlands encountered such destructive hooliganism. Other Dutch clubs associated with hooliganism include PSV Eindhoven, Ajax, FC Utrecht, FC Groningen, Twente Enschede, MVV Maastricht and ADO Den Haag.

The most violent rivalry is between Ajax and Feyenoord. A particularly serious incident was the so-called &quot;Battle of Beverwijk&quot; on 23 March 1997, in which several people were seriously injured and one killed. The 2002–03 season was marked by similar incidents, and also by fighting between fans of Ajax and FC Utrecht.
 Hooliganism in the Netherlands peaked in the 1980s and 1990s. In later years it declined due to measures taken. Hooliganism still occurs from time to time but the prevalence within the stadiums has declined.

Other serious incidents include:
* 16 June 1990, English fans were arrested for brawling before a World Cup match against the Netherlands in Italy.
* 26 April 1999, 80 hooligans were arrested for rioting after Feyenoord won the title after having played NAC Breda.
*19 February 2015, Feyenoord hooligans attacked Italian police with glass bottles and firecrackers in Piazza di Spagna before Europa League match A.S. Roma-Feyenoord,28 Dutch fans were arrested.
*2023 saw a PSV Eindhoven supporter attack Sevilla&#x27;s Serbian goalkeeper in February, 150 fans arrested in May for chanting anti-Semitic slogans on their way to a match and AZ Alkmaar fans wearing black hoods attacked West Ham United F.C. supporters in a fan zone in May.

===Poland===
Football hooligans in Poland are commonly known under Polish terms &quot;pseudokibice&quot; or &quot;kibole&quot;.

One of the biggest riots occurred at a World Cup qualifying match between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in Chorzów.

Arranged football hooligan fights in Poland are known as &quot;&quot;; they have become common in Poland since the late 1990s. On 30 March 2003, Polish police arrested 120 people after rival football supporters fought during a match between Śląsk Wrocław and Arka Gdynia. During the riot, hooligans pelted police officers with stones and fought a running battle with knives and axes. One victim was seriously injured and later died in hospital.

During the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, a knife was thrown at Italian footballer Dino Baggio, from Parma F.C. by Polish supporters (allegedly Wisła Kraków fans), injuring his head. Supporters of Legia Warszawa also attracted negative attention in Lithuania during the match against Vetra Vilnius on 10 July 2007, where hooligans of Legia destroyed the home&#x27;s team field and received a 2-year ban from all European Competitions.

The most notable hooligan incidents happened in Kraków where supporters of the Wisła Kraków and KS Cracovia teams have a rivalry that reportedly extended to killings of opposing fans.

Country-wide riots involving football fans were seen in 1998 in Słupsk and 2015 in Knurów.

===Russia===
Football hooliganism has become prevalent in Russia since the beginning of the 2000s. Hooligans are commonly associated with teams such as FC Spartak Moscow (Gladiators, Shkola, Union), PFC CSKA Moscow (Red Bluу Warriors, Gallant Steeds, Yaroslavka, Kids, Einfach Jugend), FC Dynamo Moscow (Capitals, 9-ka), FC Torpedo Moscow (Tubes, TroubleMakers), FC Lokomotiv Moscow (Red-Green&#x27;s, Vikings, BHZ, Trains Team) – all from Moscow – and FC Zenit (Music Hall, Coalition, Snakes Firm) from Saint Petersburg, FC Rostselmash (Wild Legion) from Rostov-on-Don. Russian hooligans often show an underlying resentment towards Russia&#x27;s perceived political rivals. At the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament, 50 Russian fans were deported and the international team fined €150,000 following co-ordinated violent attacks. 
===Serbia===
The most prominent groups of hooligans are associated with Belgrade and Serbia&#x27;s two main clubs, Red Star Belgrade and Partizan Belgrade. They are known as the &quot;Delije&quot; (&quot;Heroes&quot;) and &quot;Grobari&quot; (&quot;Gravediggers&quot;), respectively. FK Rad is a less-successful Belgrade club, whose associated hooligans, known locally as &quot;United Force&quot;, have notoriously been involved in many violent incidents.

On 2 December 2007, a police officer was seriously injured when he was attacked during a Serbian Superliga match between Red Star Belgrade and Hajduk Kula. The officer was attacked with burning flares and broken seats and he had to fire warning shots in the air in self-defence. He was treated for burns, cuts and bruises in a nearby hospital. The following day, the Football Association of Serbia requested government help to help crack down on football hooliganism in the country. On 14 April 2008 a football fan was killed near Novi Sad after clashes between FK Partizan&#x27;s Grobari and fans of FK Vojvodina. That same week, after a Red Star Belgrade-Partizan cup match, three people were injured and a bus destroyed by hooligans.

On 19 September 2008 a Serbian football hooligan was sentenced to ten years in jail for an attack against a police officer at a Red Star Belgrade–Hajduk Kula game. On 12 October 2010 Serbia&#x27;s Euro 2012 Qualifying clash with Italy was abandoned after only 6 minutes after several Serbian fans threw flares and fireworks onto the pitch and caused severe trouble in and out of the ground. Partizan Belgrade were disqualified from the UEFA Cup, after crowd trouble in Mostar, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. Partizan fans threw flares and stones and fought with supporters of Zrinjski Mostar and police. Fourteen Partizan fans were convicted for the murder of Toulouse FC fan Brice Taton in Belgrade. They attacked him and other fans with baseball bats and flares while wearing surgical masks. The hooligans received up to 35 years in prison.

In 2014, an Albania Serbia match saw all Albanian fans banned, the match progressed with abuse directed at Albanian players as well as threats and physical objects thrown, resulting in the match being abandoned.

===Spain===

Football hooliganism in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some black players have been victims of ethnic slurs. Samuel Eto&#x27;o, a former FC Barcelona player from Cameroon, has denounced the problem. Many black foreign players have been racially abused, such as at a 2004 friendly match between Spain and England, in which black England players such as Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole endured monkey chants from Spain supporters.

The second source is the strong rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, Luís Figo&#x27;s appearance in Barcelona&#x27;s Nou Camp stadium triggered a strong reaction: the crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other objects (including a pig&#x27;s head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish Primera División.

Hooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the General Franco fascist regime days (some Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Espanyol, Real Betis and Valencia ultras are linked to franquista groups), others with communist leanings (such as Deportivo La Coruña, Athletic Bilbao, Sevilla, Celta de Vigo, Rayo Vallecano) and the independence movements in Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called &quot;grupos ultra&quot;. Three notorious ones are the Boixos Nois, the Frente Atlético and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid respectively. There also have been local or regional disputes between rival teams, for example between Cádiz and Xerez, Betis and Sevilla, Osasuna and Real Zaragoza, or Deportivo de La Coruña and Celta.

In 1991, Frederiq Roiquier, a French supporter of Espanyol was killed by FC Barcelona hooligans who mistook him for a rival hooligan. In 1992, a 13-year-old child died at Espanyol&#x27;s stadium after being struck by a flare. In 1998, Aitor Zabaleta, a supporter of Real Sociedad, was killed by an Atlético Madrid hooligan who was linked to a neo-Nazi group (Bastión), just before a match between these two teams. In 2003, a supporter of Deportivo La Coruña was killed in riots by hooligans following his club, when he tried to protect a supporter of the opposing team, SD Compostela. Since then, authorities have made attempts to bring hooliganism under control. In 2007, there were acts of hooliganism before a match between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, with several cars being destroyed and policemen injured by flares and bottles which were thrown at them.

Hooligan violence in Spain has decreased since the late 1990s due to an alcohol ban in sporting events as well as hooligan laws which attempt fines up to 600,000 euros and stadium bans.

Since 2003 the FC Barcelona hooligans, the Boixos Nois, are not allowed to enter Camp Nou. The hardcore Barcelona hooligans subgroups were involved in police operations against organized crime. In 2008, after a hooligan incident versus Espanyol, FC Barcelona very publicly took a stand on violence, saying it hoped to stamp out violence for good. In 2007 Atlético Madrid hooligans clashed with Aberdeen FC hooligans prior to a UEFA Cup match. In 2009 and 2010, Atlético hooligans also clashed with FC Porto and Sporting Clube de Portugal groups in Portugal during UEFA Cup games. During crowd disorder control manoeuvres after a match between Athletic Bilbao and FC Schalke 04, home supporter (who was not involved in hooliganism) was shot in the head with a &#x27;Flash-ball&#x27; fired by a member of the Ertzaintza police service and later died. Later that year a Rayo Vallecano hooligan was arrested during riots in 14 November general strike and accused of terrorism.

In 2014, debate about eradicating Spanish hooligans arose after Frente Atlético members caused the death of a Riazor Blues (Deportivo La Coruña radicals) member by throwing him into the Manzanares river; and after members of the Boixos Nois stabbed two PSG supporters in Barcelona.

In 2016, football-related violence came once again to the public debate after a fight between Sevilla and Juventus supporters that occurred the day before their UEFA Champions League group stage match. Two Juventus supporters were stabbed (one of them was seriously injured but survived after being hospitalised) and a Sevilla supporter was hospitalized with head wounds caused by a glass bottle. Similarly, clashes between Spartak Moscow and Athletic Bilbao fans in 2018 received wider attention when one of the police officers involved in controlling the situation collapsed and died.

===Sweden===
Hooliganism began in Sweden in the early 20th century among fans of IFK Göteborg and Örgryte IS who clashed after and during derbies in Gothenburg. Modern hooliganism began in 1970 when fans of IFK Göteborg invaded the pitch, destroyed the goalposts and fought the police at the end of a match that relegated Göteborg from the Allsvenskan. Hooliganism in Sweden became a growing problem in the 1980s, but pitch invasions and violence at football grounds decreased in the late 1990s, when hooligan firms started pre-arranging their fights away from the grounds and the regular supporters. Seven clubs that have large organised hooligan firms are AIK (Firman Boys), IFK Göteborg (Wisemen) Djurgårdens IF (DFG) Hammarby IF (KGB) Malmö FF (True Rockers) GAIS (Gärningsmännen) and Helsingborgs IF (Frontline), though several other football, bandy and ice hockey clubs have active hooligan followings. In November 2002, 12 members of the Wisemen stood trial for inflicting life-threatening injuries on a Hammarby fan in 2001.

In August 2002, Tony Deogan, a member of the Wisemen, was killed after a pre-arranged fight against Firman Boys. Besides this fatality there have been several instances of hooligan firms intimidating and threatening players. Former AIK player Jesper Jansson received death threats and had his door painted orange (the color of Firman Boys) with the text Judas, after leaving for rival club Djurgårdens IF in 1996. Michael Hedström AIK former chief of security was also threatened and a mail bomb was sent to his address in 1998. The second fatality occurred in March 2014, when a 43-year-old Djurgården supporter was killed in Helsingborg in an assault on his way to Djurgården&#x27;s opening match in the 2014 Allsvenskan against Helsingborg. After the man&#x27;s death became known, Djurgården supporters invaded the pitch after 42 minutes of play, prompting officials to abandon the match.

===Switzerland===
Despite a reputation for generally being peaceful, Switzerland has faced significant issues with football hooliganism since the beginning of the 1980s, as in other European countries. In October 2018, Swiss Federal and Cantonal authorities noted that every third football game in Switzerland in the preceding six months had been marked by violent incidents. Statistically, most incidents involving militant supporters occurred in Zürich.

==== Instances of hooliganism ====
Switzerland&#x27;s most severe incident, dubbed the 2006 Basel Hooligan Incident, 13 May 2006, occurred on the last day of the 2005–06 season, when FC Zürich defeated FC Basel at St. Jakob Park to win the Swiss championship with a last-minute goal. After the final whistle, angry Basel hooligans stormed the field and attacked Zürich players. The Zürich team were forced to celebrate in the upper deck of the stands while the fighting continued. There was similar fighting in the streets that night.

Switzerland&#x27;s second most severe incident, happened October 2, 2011, during the Zurich Derby.

An August 2022 Europa League game between Swiss club BSC Young Boys and RSC Anderlecht in Brussels led to violent clashes in a restaurant. Belgian police saw this clash as a possible act of revenge by Anderlecht hooligans in response to violent activity at another Europa League game in Bern, Switzerland.

Another major incident occurred in November 2022, when FC Basel supporters clashed with supporters of FC Luzern in Lucerne, leading to street battles and clashes with police.

==== Police Response ====
Swiss authorities take preemptive steps to prevent hooliganism both in Switzerland and abroad. Approximately 800 known Swiss hooligans were banned by the Swiss Federal Police from leaving Switzerland to travel to the 2016 European football championship.

===Turkey===
According to the &quot;Turkish Daily News&quot;, hooligan groups are well organised, have their own &quot;leaders&quot;, and often consist of organised street fighters. These groups have a &quot;racon&quot; (code of conduct), which states that the intention must be to injure rather than kill and that a stab must be made below the waist. Other hooligans have fired firearms into the air to celebrate their team&#x27;s victory, which has been known to accidentally kill innocent people watching the celebrations on their balconies.

Trouble has arisen during matches between Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe. However, the Turkish Football Federation has tightened security to try to contain the hooliganism. During the 2005 Turkish Cup final between Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe, 8,000 police, stewards and officials were employed to prevent violence. In 2006, the Turkish Football Federation introduced new measures to combat the threat of hooliganism and have made new regulations that allow the Professional Football Disciplinary Board to fine clubs up to YTL 250,000 for their fans&#x27; behavior. Repeat offenders could be fined up to YTL 500,000. Despite reports from the Turkish Football Federation, the Turkish police believe that football hooliganism is not a major threat and is &quot;isolated incidents&quot;.

Before Galatasaray&#x27;s semi-final UEFA Cup match with Leeds United in 2000, two Leeds fans, Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, were stabbed to death in Istanbul following street fights between Turkish and British hooligans. UEFA allowed the game to proceed and Galatasaray won, 2–0. Leeds complained because home fans jeered while a message of condolence was read for the victims. Galatasaray&#x27;s players refused to wear black arm bands. The Leeds chairman at the time, Peter Ridsdale, accused Galatasaray of &quot;showing a lack of respect&quot;. He also revealed that his team&#x27;s players had received death threats before the match.

Ali Ümit Demir was arrested and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for the stabbing, but the sentence was reduced to 5 years on the basis of heavy provocation, while five others were given lesser sentences of under four months. The families of those accused of attacking with knives are reported to have defended their actions and approved of their children punishing the &quot;rude British people&quot;. Galatasaray fans were banned from traveling to the return match to try to avoid further clashes between fans, although there were reports of attacks by Leeds fans on Turkish television crews and the police. However, the Assistant Chief Constable in charge of policing the game believed that the number of arrests was &quot;no worse than a normal high category game&quot;. Hakan Şükür was hit with projectiles from Leeds United supporters and the Galatasaray team bus was stoned after driving through an underpass. The game saw Emre Belözoğlu and Harry Kewell sent off and Galatasaray sealed their way to the final with a 2–2 score.

Violence also occurred between Arsenal fans (mainly from The Herd) and Galatasaray fans before the 2000 UEFA Cup final in Copenhagen in which a Galatasaray fan, an Arsenal fan and a Dane were said to have been stabbed. Galatasaray later won the match after a penalty shoot-out.

On 24 May 2001, 50 people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between French club PSG and Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.[16][17]PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500.[18] In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.

During the 2003–2004 season, a Second League Category A, match between Karşıyaka and Göztepe on 8 February 2004, involved rival Karşıyaka and Göztepe supporters clashing and the match was subsequently stopped for 33 minutes. This was due to Karşıyaka leading 5–2 after coming back from a 2–0 deficit. After the match, Göztepe fans clashed with the police, seven police officers were wounded and fifteen Göztepe fans were arrested.

Bursaspor fans clashed with policemen at a match against Samsunspor match in the Süper Lig in Adapazarı at the end of the 2003–04 season. The match was played in Adapazarı due to events at a previous match between Bursaspor and Çaykur Rizespor. Bursaspor were playing to avoid relegation. Bursaspor won 1–0 the but were relegated to Category A after rivals won. After the match, Bursaspor fans ripped out and threw seats at the Sakarya Atatürk Stadium They also fought with craftsmen of Gölcük during their journey to Adapazarı. The Bursaspor-Diyarbakırspor game in March 2010 was suspended in the 17th minute after Diyarbakırspor supporters threw objects on the field. One object struck and knocked down an assistant referee.

On 7 May 2011, Bursaspor supporters clashed with the police ahead of the team&#x27;s match with rival Beşiktaş. 25 police officers and 9 fans were injured in the violence. During the Fenerbahçe-Galatasaray game at the end of 2011–2012 season Fenerbahçe fans clashed with the police, causing $2 million of damage.

The 1967 Kayseri Atatürk Stadium disaster was the worst hooliganism event in Turkish history. It resulted in 40 deaths and 600 injuries. The violence started following provocation by the Kayserispor fans at half-time, after Kayserispor took the lead in the first half. Supporters of the two teams, some of them armed with bats and knives, began to throw rocks at each other, and fans fleeing the violence caused a stampede in front of the stand exits. The events in the stadium were followed by vandalism in Kayseri and days of riots in Sivas.

On 13 May 2013, a Fenerbahce fan was stabbed to death after the Istanbul derby. The Fenerbahce fan was on his way back home after the match between Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray, when he was attacked by a group of Galatasaray fans at a bus stop, and died in hospital later.

In 2015, confectioners Ülker—previously &quot;one of Turkish football&#x27;s biggest sponsors&quot;—ceased their support, reportedly due to &quot;low crowds, violence and poor atmosphere at matches&quot;.

In December 2023 the club president of MKE Ankaragücü football club was arrested after it appeared he punched the referee, fans also invaded the pitch following a late equaliser by the visiting team. All league football games were suspended in turkey indefinitely following the assault, which resulted in the referee also being kicked repeatedly whilst on the ground.

===United Kingdom===
There are records of football hooliganism in the UK from the 1880s, and from no later than the 1960s the UK had a worldwide reputation for it – the phenomenon was often dubbed the &quot;English Disease&quot;. John Moynihan in &quot;The Soccer Syndrome&quot; describes a stroll around an empty Goodison Park touchline on a summer&#x27;s day in the 1960s. &quot;Walking behind the infamous goal, where they built a barrier to stop objects crunching into visiting goalkeepers, there was a strange feeling of hostility remaining as if the regulars had never left.&quot; &quot;The News of the World&quot;&#x27;s Bob Pennington spoke of the &quot;lunatic fringe of support that fastens onto them (Everton), seeking identification in a multi-national port where roots are hard to establish.&quot; The same newspaper later described Everton supporters as the &quot;roughest, rowdiest rabble who watches British soccer.&quot;

From the 1970s, many organised hooligan firms sprang up, with most Football League clubs having at least one known organised hooligan element. Hooliganism was often at its worst when local rivals played each other. Supporters of teams including Arsenal, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Leeds United, Millwall, Birmingham City, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth, Sunderland A.F.C., Newcastle United, West Ham United, Leicester City, Bristol City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Stoke City and Cardiff City were among those most frequently linked to hooliganism.

Racism became a factor in hooliganism around the same time, as black players appeared regularly on English league teams from the 1970s. Black players were frequently targeted with monkey chants and had bananas thrown at them. Members of far-right groups including the National Front also sprayed racist slogans and distributed racist literature at matches.

Sectarian violence has long been a regular factor of crowd violence, as well as offensive chanting, at matches in Scotland between Celtic and Rangers. During the 2022 League Cup final at Hampden Park during the one-minute applause for the recently passed Hibernian chairman, Rangers fans sang &quot;We are the billy boys&quot;. Hooliganism in Scottish football has reduced in intensity since its heights in the 1970s, however, it has seen a slight increase recently, with many teams having a small firm. Hearts were fined due to their fan&#x27;s behaviour at Europa Conference matches against Istanbul and RFS.

As a result of the Heysel Stadium disaster at Brussels, Belgium, in 1985 between Juventus and Liverpool, where rioting Liverpool fans led to the death of 39 Juventus fans, English clubs were banned from all European competitions until 1990, with Liverpool banned for an additional year. Many of the football hooligan gangs in the UK used hooliganism as a cover for acquisitive forms of crime, specifically theft and burglary. In the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government led a major crackdown on football-related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations including pubs rather than at the matches themselves.

Birmingham City&#x27;s multi-racial hooligan element gained the nickname &quot;Zulus&quot; because of the chant the Firm gave during build ups to fights with other firms. As explained in &quot;One Eyed Baz&#x27;s&quot; Barrington Pattersons biography (), confirming the firm&#x27;s nickname was not derived from derogatory chanting by other firms.

Other English and Welsh clubs who have made the headlines for the worst and most frequent cases of hooliganism include Chelsea (whose then chairman Ken Bates installed an electric fence at the club&#x27;s stadium in the mid-1980s to combat hooligans, but was refused permission to switch it on during matches), Leeds United (who were banned from European competitions following a riot after the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern München), Liverpool (14 of whose fans were convicted after a riot at the 1985 European Cup final resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators at Heysel Stadium in Belgium when a stadium wall collapsed), Manchester United (who were initially banned from the European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup in 1977 after their fans rioted at a game in France, although they were reinstated to the competition on appeal), Millwall (whose fans were involved in a notorious hooliganism incident involving rioting in an FA Cup tie at Luton in 1985), Tottenham Hotspur who gained notoriety for the 1974 UEFA Cup Final disturbances and again in Rotterdam in 1983, Wolves (who had dozens of fans convicted of incidents in the late 1980s involving the Subway Army hooligan firm at matches against teams including Cardiff City and Scarborough when they were in the Fourth Division), and Cardiff City whose hooligan element, known as the Soul Crew, is one of the most infamous football hooligan firms.

In March 2002, the Seaburn Casuals (a Sunderland A.F.C. firm) fought with hooligans from the Newcastle Gremlins in a pre-arranged clash near the North Shields Ferry terminal, in what was described as &quot;some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom&quot;. The leaders of the Gremlins and Casuals were both jailed for four years for conspiracy, with 28 others jailed for various terms, based on evidence gained after police examined the messages sent by mobile phone between the gang members on the day.

In February 2015, before Chelsea FC played against Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Four Chelsea football fans were convicted of racist violence and given suspended prison sentences after a black citizen was pushed off a Paris Métro in Paris while fans chanted: &quot;We&#x27;re racist, we&#x27;re racist, and that&#x27;s the way we like it&quot;. The four men were ordered to pay €10,000 to the black commuter they pushed off the Métro carriage.

In December 2018, a Napoli fan who attended a Champions League group stage match between Liverpool and Napoli as a gift from his parents, said that he was attacked by a group of seven Liverpool hooligans who surrounded him upon leaving the stadium. He was said to have been admitted to Royal Liverpool University Hospital with a fractured cheekbone and trauma to one eye. But it was apparently only after flagging down a car that he and a friend managed to get help. The victim was quoted as saying, &quot;I thought I was going to die.&quot; Some reports have stressed that this was an attack on a lone fan and not a fight between rival groups.

On the day of the UEFA Euro 2020 final (which was played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the match between England and Italy was marred as riots broke out at the entrance to Wembley Stadium, and in both Leicester Square and Trafalgar Square; 86 people were arrested by police.

In September 2021, Leicester City played Napoli at home in a UEFA Europa League group stage match. Supporters of both clubs clashed, which resulted in a street fight around a mile away from the stadium, and disorder at the end of the match.

In September 2022, approximately 100 German hooligans in masks armed with machetes and knuckle dusters stormed a pub near Wembley Stadium before an England v Germany UEFA Nations League match.

=== Ukraine ===
Football hooliganism in Ukraine started in the 1980s. The first big fight (more than 800 people) involving football hooligans occurred in September 1987 between Dynamo Kyiv and Spartak Moscow fans in the center of Kyiv. The 1990s passed in relative silence, as there were no big fights between hooligans. On 5 September 1998 an important game between Ukraine and Russia&#x27;s national football teams was played. Ukrainian hooligans began to unite in &quot;national crews&quot; to resist Russian fans. However, the mass union did not take place due to police intervention and were mainly composed of Ukrainian fans from Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk. In March 2001, several crews united and attacked 80 Belarusian fans after match between Ukraine and Belarus national football teams. At that exact time hooligans and ultras were separated, due to changes of views on supporting movement. On 15 April 2002 about 50 right-wing Dynamo fans attacked the Jewish quarter in Kyiv, targeting local businesses, the synagogue, and Jewish worshipers.

Since 2005 clashes between hooligans have occurred mostly outside the city because of a greater police presence. During Euro 2012 several leaders of football hooligans came under government pressure. During the Revolution of Dignity the unification of all fans was announced and a ban was imposed on any provocation, such as burning attributes, fighting, or offensive songs. During the war in eastern Ukraine many hooligans and ultras went to the defense of the state. Parts of the Azov Brigade were formed from a FC Metalist Kharkiv hooligan group named &quot;Sect 82&quot;. Ukraine’s volunteer group, Kraken Regiment filled its ranks with “gym rats,” bouncers and “ultras&quot; and would show their love for Kharkiv&#x27;s Metalist team as they had helped take back villages in the north of Kharkiv. BBC would report that Right Sector&#x27;s organization in Kyiv would have its backbone made up of Russian-speaking, Ukrainian football fans sharing nationalist views. 

Ukrainian hooligans have also been involved in incidents with foreign clubs. After the match between FC Dnipro and Saint Etienne in Kyiv several French fans were hospitalized after stabbings. On 20 August 2015 there was a big fight in Hydropark between hooligans from Legia Warsaw and from Dynamo and Zorya hooligans. The biggest clash since unification occurred in Kyiv, 6 December 2016 between Dynamo and Beşiktaş hooligans. A few days before Kyiv about 7,000 fans arrived from Istanbul. Two days before the match, different parts of Ukrainian capital witnessed the outbreak of numerous conflicts on the streets.

Typically the biggest confrontations involving Ukrainian hooligans occur in domestic competitions. The most famous confrontations are the Klasychne derby, and South-West derby between FC Karpaty Lviv and Shakhtar Donetsk, as well as local derbys such as the Donetsk derby and the Kyiv derby.
==North America==
===Canada===
Toronto FC formally banned supporter firm &quot;Inebratti&quot; for hooliganism at a match between TFC and Ottawa Fury FC on July 18, 2018.

On May 10, 2023, during a Canadian Championship semi-final against rivals CF Montreal, Toronto FC fans traveled to the away end where a brawl begun between the two sets of fans. Members of both groups were escorted out and away fans were banned from the next league derby.

===El Salvador and Honduras===
The &quot;Football War&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La guerra del fútbol&quot;), also known as the &quot;Soccer War&quot; or &quot;100 Hour War&quot;, was a brief war fought by El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from El Salvador to Honduras. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second North American qualifying round of the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Honduras and El Salvador met in the second North American qualifying round for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1–0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after extra time.

The war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence &quot;100 Hour War&quot;), which took full effect on 20 July. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that &quot;the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans&quot;. This led to border clashes between the two nations.

===Mexico===
Football hooliganism in Mexico appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of Monterrey and Morelia at a Primera División match in Monterrey in 2003. In June 1998, one man died and several people were injured when Mexico football fans rioted after Mexico lost to Germany in the World Cup. After the match, hundreds of riot police were brought in to restore order because fans were looting and rioting. Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested. In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas. Several police were hospitalized. As a result, Chivas banned all of their supporters for the Clasico against Club America.

At the 2015 Gold Cup, Mexican hooligans threw trash and drinks in separate games against Trinidad and Tobago and Panama.

On 5 March 2022, a riot broke out during a match between Querétaro F.C. and Atlas F.C.

===United States===
While soccer is traditionally viewed in the United States as a family-friendly event, played by children and supported by parents, some violence does still occur. On 20 July 2008, in a friendly match between Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew and English Premier League club West Ham United, in Columbus, Ohio, a fight broke out between rival fans. Police estimated more than 100 people were involved. An unruly encounter occurred between Toronto FC fans in 2009, upset from a loss in the Trillium Cup, and Columbus Crew fans. One Toronto fan was tasered by Columbus police.

That same weekend, a riot was narrowly avoided at a packed Giants Stadium as members of the New York Red Bulls supporters club, Empire Supporters Club (ESC), and members of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority security force clashed over what the ESC claimed was unfair and repeated mistreatment. Clashes also took place in the parking area around the stadium after the game, involving already ejected-for-life North Jersey Firm (NJF) members, and the New Jersey State Police were called to quell the situation. There were several arrests, mostly of known NJF hooligans. A rare moment of violence broke out in Seattle in March 2010 after a pre-season Portland Timbers win in Seattle, when three Sounders fans attacked a Timbers fan, choking and dragging him with his team scarf. On 21 April 2013 in Portland, a Portland Timbers supporter was assaulted by a group of San Jose Earthquakes supporters. While he was sitting in his car, he had taunted his scarf at a group of San Jose Supporters, one of which ran toward him and attacked him through his car window, breaking his car windshield and assaulting him. San Jose&#x27;s 1906 Ultras were subsequently banned by the club from traveling to away matches. After much debate, the ban was lifted. On 10 August 2015, fans of New York Red Bulls and New York City FC clashed in a brawl outside a pub throwing trash and exchanging blows. On 23 May 2016, fans of both NYCFC rioted outside Yankee Stadium in response to NYC FC&#x27;s 7–0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls.

However, football (soccer) and other sports hooliganism overall is rare in the United States in part because of stricter legal penalties for vandalism and physical violence, club markets having their own territory of fans, venues banning weapons, and stricter security during games. Although isolated drunken fights at games do occur, they rarely escalate to major brawling comparable to Europe and Latin America.

==South America==

===Argentina===
====Early days (1920s–1940s)====
The first murder related to Argentine football occurred on 21 September 1922 in Rosario, during the second half of a home match of Tiro Federal Argentino and Newell&#x27;s Old Boys for the Copa Estímulo of the local first division. In a discussion between two fans, Enrique Battcock, a railroad worker and supporter of the home club (also former footballer and former member of the club&#x27;s directing) was questioning Francisco Campá (Newell&#x27;s Old Boys&#x27; supporter and member of the club&#x27;s directing) about his behaviour. That ended when Battcock hit Cambá in the face. Cambá retired from the stadium, returned after a little while, extracted a gun and shot him, causing Battcock&#x27;s death.

Another murder occurred in Montevideo on 2 November 1924 when Boca Juniors supporter José Lázaro Rodríguez shot and killed Uruguayan fan Pedro Demby after the final match of the South American Championship between Argentina and Uruguay, which Uruguay won.

On 14 May 1939 at the stadium of Lanús (in Greater Buenos Aires), in a match between the minor divisions of the home team and Boca Juniors, both teams began to fight after a foul committed by a Lanús player. Seeing this, Boca Juniors fans attempted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them, killing two spectators: Luis López and Oscar Munitoli (a 9-year-old).

The violence was not only among fans, footballers and police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell&#x27;s Old Boys and San Lorenzo de Almagro at Newell&#x27;s Old Boys stadium (in the city of Rosario), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied 2–2 when Cossio disallowed a goal by Newell&#x27;s, and San Lorenzo de Almagro scored in the next play, aggravating the Newell&#x27;s supporters. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell&#x27;s Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.

====Formation of barra brava culture (1950s–1990s)====
Although violence in Argentine football was already present from the beginning, organized groups called barras bravas began to appear in the 1950s (for example, Independiente, San Lorenzo de Almagro, Lanús, Rosario Central, Vélez Sarsfield, Racing) and 1960s (for example, Belgrano, Boca Juniors, River Plate), and continued to grow in the coming decades. With time, every football club in Argentina started to have its own barra brava of violent supporters. Argentine hooligans are reputed to be the most dangerous organized supporter groups in the world, and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of Independiente (La barra del Rojo), Boca Juniors, River Plate (Los Borrachos del Tablón),
San Lorenzo, and Newell&#x27;s Old Boys.

The journalist Amílcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed for some years), with the random murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (a Boca Juniors supporter -not identified as such- who, circumstantially was watching a match between Vélez Sársfield and River Plate at the José Amalfitani Stadium). Linker was located in the grandstand of the River Plate fans when some of them started a fight and the police threw tear gas grenades. One grenade hit Linker in the chest causing his death. Before the emergence of these groups, visiting teams were harassed by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure:

In this way, each club began having its own barra brava funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the level of violence.

After the death of Linker, Argentine football began a phase marked by &quot;habituation&quot; to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Amílcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, an average of one every three months. However, the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or &quot;accidents&quot;.

In 1964 more than 300 football fans died and another 500 were injured in Lima, Peru in a riot during an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Peru on 24 May. On 11 April 1967 in Argentina, before a match between Huracán and Racing de Avellaneda, a 15 year old Racing fan was murdered by the Huracán barra brava at the Tomás Adolfo Ducó stadium. Over 70 Boca Juniors fans died in 1968 when crowds attending a Superclásico in Buenos Aires stampeded after youths threw burning paper onto the terraces and the exit was locked.

From the 1980s onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the World Cup matches of the Argentina national football team. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or ultras) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football were recorded, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged.

An example of the violence of this years was the death of Roberto Basile. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the &quot;Bombonera&quot; stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.

In 1997 a member of La Guardia Imperial (barra brava of Racing de Avellaneda) was murdered by an Independiente supporter.

====High-profile incidents (2000s–present)====

In 2001, another supporter of Racing was killed, and the barra brava of Independiente was the main suspect. Independiente and Racing (both from the city of Avellaneda, in the Greater Buenos Aires) have a huge rivalry, the second most important in Argentina but maybe the fiercest (notably, their stadiums are only 300 meters apart).

The next year, one fan was killed and 12 people injured, including six police officers when fans of Racing Club de Avellaneda and Club Atlético Independiente clashed in February 2002.

An Independiente fan was shot dead, and another fan was shot in the back and hospitalized when about 400 rival fans fought outside Racing Clubs stadium, El Cilindro, in Avellaneda before the match. Between 70 and 80 people were arrested as a result. The match started late when Independiente fans threw a smoke bomb at Racing Club goalkeeper, Gustavo Campagnuolo. That same weekend, 30 people were arrested and 10 police officers injured when fighting broke out at a match between Estudiantes de La Plata and Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata in La Plata.

A 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in Argentina stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of knife and shotgun casualties. At one point, the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2,000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information). The Boca group, known as La Doce (&quot;The Twelfth&quot;) has a long history of violence. In 2002 Diego Maradona was alleged to remain friends with the group&#x27;s leaders, in spite of their reputation.
In 2004, while driving up to Rosario to watch their side play Rosario Central, Los Borrachos del Tablón (River&#x27;s Barra Bravas) confronted a bus of Newell&#x27;s firm (one of the big rival firms) on Highway 9, in a battle that killed two Newell&#x27;s fans. Up to this day, some members of Los Borrachos still face charges because of the deaths.

In 2005 a footballer, Carlos Azcurra, was shot and seriously wounded by a police officer, when rival fans rioted during a Primera B Nacional match between local Mendoza rivals (but not a derby) San Martín de Mendoza and Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba. At half-time, fans had thrown rocks onto the pitch, and just before the end of the match, fans from both clubs invaded the pitch and started fighting. The players who had stayed on the pitch, including Ezcurra, tried to calm the fans, and he was shot when police tried to stop the fans by firing rubber bullets.

During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, there was a confrontation between 6 members of the barra brava of Independiente and 16 members of the barras bravas of Boca Juniors and Defensa y Justicia (both were together) in the Czech Republic (the country where the three barras bravas were housed). As a result of the fight, a supporter of Boca Juniors had to be hospitalized.

In 2007, during a match of the promotion/relegation playoff of the 2006–2007 season between Nueva Chicago and Tigre (in the Nueva Chicago&#x27;s stadium), a fight broke out between the barras bravas of both teams. When a penalty was given to Tigre (who was winning the match 2–1, a result that relegated to Nueva Chicago to the Second division) in the 92nd minute, the barra brava of Nueva Chicago invaded the pitch and ran in the direction of the stand occupied by the supporters of Tigre to attack them. After this, there were serious riots near the stadium (not only caused by the barras bravas, but also by regular supporters) and as a result, a fan of Tigre died.

On 19 March 2010 in a bar in Rosario, the ex-leader of the Newell&#x27;s Old Boys barra brava (Roberto &quot;Pimpi&quot; Camino) was fatally shot. Camino and his sub-group led the barra brava from 2002 to 2009, when they were expelled from it due to their defeat at the hands of another sub-group, which currently dominates La Hinchada Más Popular, the barra brava of Newell&#x27;s Old Boys. Some members of the now main sub-group are the suspects of the murder, and the bar&#x27;s owners are suspected of helping them.

In the early morning of 4 July 2010 (the next day of the match between Argentina and Germany for quarter-finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup) in Cape Town, South Africa, there was a fight between some members of the barras bravas of Independiente and Boca Juniors. During the brawl, one member of the Boca Juniors barra brava lost consciousness after being brutally beaten by the Independiente fanatics. He was admitted to a hospital in the city and died there on 5 July.

On 14 May 2015, in the second leg of the 2015 Copa Libertadores round of 16 match between River Plate and Boca Juniors at La Bombonera, hooligans sprayed a substance which irritated River Plate players&#x27; eyes, and the game was suspended. CONMEBOL opened up disciplinarily proceedings against Boca Juniors on the incident and were later disqualified from the tournament two days later. River Plate would later advance to the quarterfinals and eventually, win the tournament.

From 1922 to 2022, there were 342 deaths related to Argentine football,
excluding the 300 dead in Peru in 1964.

===Brazil===
Fans in Brazil join in organized groups known as torcidas organizadas (&quot;organized supporters&quot;) often considered criminal organizations that differ in many aspects from European hooligans. They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other &quot;torcidas organizadas&quot; as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul (Avaí Futebol Clube), Força Jovem Vasco (CR Vasco da Gama), Galoucura (Atlético Mineiro) and Mancha Verde (SE Palmeiras), the alliance between Torcida Independente (São Paulo F.C.), Torcida Jovem (CR Flamengo), Máfia Azul (Cruzeiro Esporte Clube) and Leões da TUF (Fortaleza Esporte Clube) and some other alliances. The &quot;torcidas organizadas&quot; are usually bigger and more committed to the spectacle in the stadiums than the English hooligan fans but they often schedule fights against rival groups where many are injured and killed.

Fans of local rivals TJP – Torcida Jovem Ponte Preta (Associação Atlética Ponte Preta) and TFI -Torcida Fúria Independente (Guarani Futebol Clube) clashed and rioted at a match in Campinas in 2002. Violence had been expected, and just before kick-off, fans started fighting. Police tried to intervene but were pelted by stones. As the fighting continued inside the stadium, a railing collapsed and numerous fans fell over 13 ft (four metres) into a pit between the stands and the pitch. Over 30 people were injured.

===Uruguay===
Following a 5–0 victory against arch-rivals Nacional in April 2014, Peñarol have adopted an increasingly violent attitude in the Uruguayan Clasico. While losing a championship play-off match against Nacional in June 2015, Peñarol&#x27;s fans started a riot that delayed the game by 15 minutes before it was called off. In March 2016, Pablo Montiel – a supporter of Nacional – was shot to death by Peñarol fans while walking in the same neighborhood as Peñarol&#x27;s new stadium. Ignacio Ruglio, a board member of Peñarol who have openly spread lies about Nacional, was interrogated by police following the murder of Montiel. In November 2016, the Uruguayan Clasico was cancelled before kick-off after Peñarol&#x27;s supporters started a riot at the Estadio Centenario – one supporter was arrested holding a pistol, intended to shoot down Nacional players from the Amsterdam tribune. After winning a Clasico for Peñarol in September 2017, team captain Cristian Rodríguez openly called for murdering Nacional fans while celebrating the victory.

==East Asia==
===China===
Football hooliganism in China is often linked to accusations of corrupt refereeing, with Chinese football being plagued by allegations of match fixing in the early 2000s. After a match in 2000 between Shaanxi National Power and Chengdu F.C. in Xi&#x27;an, football fans clashed with police who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd. Eight people were arrested but later released. In March 2002 hundreds of football fans rioted at a match in Xi&#x27;an between Shaanxi National Power and Qingdao Etsong Hainiu, as a result of fans&#x27; suspicions of match-fixing.

Two years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi&#x27;an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism.

In June 2002, riots in Fuzhou, Fujian had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police. The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the World Cup match between China and Brazil at an outside broadcast. On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when China lost 3–1 to Japan in the final of the AFC Asian Cup. Japanese flags were burned and a Japanese Embassy official&#x27;s car vandalised. Japanese fans had to be protected by the police, and bussed to safety. The rioting was attributed to ill-feeling toward Japan for atrocities committed before and during the Second World War.

===North Korea===
There was brief unrest among North Korean fans at an international football match against Iran at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea on 30 March 2005, when a North Korean player got into an argument with the Syrian referee.

=== Japan ===
There was no hooliganism in Japan before the J.League was established in 1993, but since its inception, Urawa Red Diamonds, Kashima Antlers, Gamba Osaka, and other players have engaged in hooliganism.

In particular, the actions of the Urawa hooligans were called into question by posting a discriminatory banner reading &quot;Japanese only&quot; and prohibiting foreigners from entering the home side stand during a home game on March 8, 2014, leading to the first J.League game without spectators.

Urawa was not satisfied with this and continued to engage in hooliganism, and on August 2, 2023, during the Emperor&#x27;s Cup match against Nagoya, they relentlessly chased Nagoya supporters, claiming they had been provoked after the match, damaging the Nagoya banner, and attacking security guards. More than 70 people were punished, including for assault, and their qualifications for next year&#x27;s Emperor&#x27;s Cup were revoked.

==South Asia==
===Bangladesh===
Football hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a B-League match between Mohammedan Sporting Club and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. When the referee disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire tear gas at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.

===India===
On 16 August 1980, supporters of Kolkata teams Mohunbagan and East Bengal engaged in a violent clash that killed 16 and injured over 100. Kolkata police had to intervene and use force to take control of situation.

===Nepal===
Nepali supporters at Dasarath Stadium occasionally tend to act violently during international matches. Cell phones and other objects were thrown during a match against Bangladesh, and coins were hurled at players at a match against Palestine.

==Southeast Asia==

=== Indonesia ===
Football hooliganism in Indonesia dates back to the late 1980s, stemming from the rivalries among fans of Persib Bandung, Persebaya Surabaya, PSMS Medan, PSM Makassar and intra-regional derbies. Violence in football in Indonesia has increased since 2000 until now. The hottest derby is the Indonesia derby between Persija Jakarta from the capital city of Indonesia and Persib Bandung from the West Java capital provincial. Another hottest derby is the East Java derby between Persebaya Surabaya from the provincial capital of East Java and Arema of the biggest competitors in the province.

Between 1995 and 2018 there have been 70 deaths in Indonesian football, 21 deaths of which occurred at the hands of a mob. Football hooliganism in Indonesia often caused damage to stadium properties.

The deadliest incident occurred on 1 October 2022, after host Arema FC lost to Persebaya for the first time at home in 23 years. At least 129 people died following a stampede after police fired tear gas at supporters in an effort to stop a pitch invasion. The incident is the deadliest football-related disaster in Asia, as well as the second-deadliest worldwide. Arema ultras also damaged parts of Kanjuruhan Stadium and torched police vehicles.

Small scale riots also sometimes occur in West Java. Involving two local teams, namely Persib from Bandung, the capital city of the province and Persikabo 1973 from Bogor Regency, an area south of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. The rivalry between the two clubs is known as the Pasundan derby or the West Java derby. Likewise with the rivalry between two lower division teams from North Maluku, Persiter based in Ternate and Persikota based in Tidore. This rivalry, known as the Old North Maluku derby, is the hottest football rivalry in the region, In fact, many factors that originally did not originate from football can spread into it.

===Malaysia===
Football hooliganism in Malaysia has occurred frequently in league or international matches since 1980 and is frequently associated with various clubs, such as Kedah FA, Kelantan FA, Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim F.C. (simply known as JDT), Pahang FA, Sarawak FA, Selangor FA and Terengganu FA. At the 2014 AFF Championship, after Malaysia lost 1–2 to Vietnam at home, some Malaysian hooligans rushed to the Vietnamese supporters&#x27; area and began attacking Vietnamese fans, resulting in injuries. After a series of investigation, a number of the hooligan supporters were found to be from the &quot;Inter-Johor Firm&quot;, a group of JDT supporters and have since been banned from attending any matches.

In May 2015, during the final of the FA Cup, Singaporean LionsXII players and their fans were stranded at the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium for about five hours after Terengganu fans turned violent over their team&#x27;s failure to reach the final. Also in the same year on 8 September 2015, a 2018 World Cup qualification match between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia was abandoned after Malaysian hooligans disrupted the match and attacked Saudi supporters. The scoreline before the match was abandoned was 1–2 in favour of Saudi Arabia.

Another incident during the 2017 Southeast Asian Games hosted by Malaysia occurred on 21 August, when two supporters from Myanmar was assaulted by a group of unidentified assailants after the end of the men&#x27;s football group match between Malaysia and Myanmar. On 24 November 2018, it was reported that around 20 Burmese fans, including girls, waiting for a bus in Kuala Lumpur were attacked by around 30 Malaysians who physically and verbally assaulted the, after the end of a group match between Malaysia and Myanmar at the 2018 AFF Championship. According to the fans, the attackers shouted &quot;babi&quot; (pigs) at them as some of them ran off from the scene. Those injured in the attack had to be taken to a nearby hospital with the help of a local charity organisation. Three of the girls suffered serious injuries and their mobile phones also snatched by the attackers. On 19 November 2019, Malaysian and Indonesian fans clashed and threw smoke bombs, flares and bottles at each other in a FIFA World Cup qualification match between Malaysia and Indonesia, which ended in a 2–0 win for the home side. Security officials arrested 27 Malaysians and 14 Indonesians.

===Myanmar===
Hooliganism at Myanmar&#x27;s football matches is common. On 1 October 2011, FIFA announced that Myanmar would be banned from the 2018 World Cup qualifiers after a home tie against Oman had to be stopped when the crowd pelted the opposition with bottles and rocks. 
However, the ban was lifted on 7 November 2011 after FIFA reconsidered the appeal made by the Myanmar Football Federation (MFF). During the 2013 Southeast Asian Games which Myanmar hosted, the sudden defeat of Myanmar football team to Indonesia in the group match that caused them to fail to qualify for the semi-finals led the Myanmar hooligan supporters to tear up seats, hurl stones at officers and burn Southeast Asian Games memorabilia and other billboards.

===Thailand===
Hooliganism has begun to cast a dark cloud on Thai football, especially in the 2010s, with several club or international matches being marred with violence. During the 2014 Thai Premier League, the 3–1 victory of Muangthong United against Singhtarua sparked violence between the supporters of the two clubs. Another incident involving Thai supporters following Thailand&#x27;s victory against Vietnam in the 2015 AFF U-19 Youth Championship hosted by Laos began when they set off signal flares, causing the police to fire a warning shot after they entered the stands to quell the unrest and were met with a violent response. Also after their victory in the 2016 AFF Championship, the Football Association of Thailand (FAT) was fined U$30,000 for failing to prevent the hooligan supporters in their own stadium from setting off flares. Despite its cooperation with police in finding and arresting the hooligans, Thailand has been warned that severe punishment will be given if it happens again at any future FIFA or AFC matches.

===Vietnam===
Shortly after the end of the second leg 2016 AFF Championship semi-finals match in Hanoi between Indonesia and Vietnam, the Indonesian team while on their way back to their hostel was suddenly attacked by angry Vietnamese supporters riding motorcycles who threw two large rocks into their bus following the failure of the Vietnamese national team to qualify for the finals, resulting in minor injuries to an Indonesian goalkeeping coach and their team doctor. A replacement bus was eventually dispatched with heavy security from the Vietnamese authorities following the attacks. The Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) and other Vietnamese fans issued an apology for the incident.

==West Asia==
===Israel===
In the 2000s, tensions surrounding the Arab–Israeli conflict spilled over into sporadic riots between Jewish and Arab Israeli football fans. In December 2000 it was reported that every club in Israel was on a final warning following escalating violence and intimidation at matches.

A number of incidents have involved Beitar Jerusalem, including racist abuse against overseas players, anti-Arab chants, use of smoke bombs and fireworks, and rioting. Beitar has a hooligan firm, La Familia, whose members consider Israeli Arabs to be their enemy. In November 2007 the Israel Football Association (IFA) ordered Beitar to play their game against the Arab club, Bnei Sakhnin behind closed doors after Beitar fans, led by La Familia, broke a minute&#x27;s silence for former Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin and sang chants in praise of his assassin, Yigal Amir. After a pitch invasion led by La Familia on 13 April 2008, when Beitar were leading Maccabi Herzliya, 1–0, and about to win the Israeli Premier League, the match was abandoned and the points were awarded to their opponents. Beitar was docked two points and had to play its remaining home games behind closed doors.

===Jordan===
Football riots in Jordan are generally regarded as an expression of tension between the country&#x27;s Palestinian ethnic group and those who regard themselves as ethnically Jordanian, the two groups being of roughly equal size.

In December 2010, rioting broke out following a game between rival Amman clubs Al-Wehdat and Al-Faisaly clubs. Some Al-Faisali fans threw bottles at Al-Wehdat players and their fans. About 250 people were injured, 243 of them Al-Wehdat fans, according to senior officials from the hospitals. According to Al Jazeera, supporters of Al-Wehdat are generally of Palestinian origin, while Faisaly fans are of Jordanian origin. A similar riot occurred in 2009.

===Syria===
On 12 March 2004 a fight between Arab and Kurdish supporters of rival Syrian football clubs at a match in Qamishli, north east of Damascus, escalated into full-scale riots that left over 30 people dead and hundreds injured.

==Africa==

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
Four died when troops opened fire at a derby match between AS Vita Club and DC Motema Pembe at the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa in November 1998. In April 2001, 14 people died following a stampede at a derby match between TP Mazembe and FC Saint Eloi Lupopo. When fans invaded the pitch after Mazembe had equalised, and rival fans started throwing missiles at each other, the police fired tear gas, and fans rushed to escape the effects of the tear gas. In the resulting stampede, 14 people died. Fans of the two clubs are alleged to have a history of hatred and violence towards each other.

===Egypt===

In January 2006 riot police attacked Libyan fans in the Cairo International Stadium after they threw missiles at the Egyptian fans in the tier above them during a match between the Egypt national football team and the Morocco national team. The Libyan fans had stayed on to watch the match after they had seen Libya lose 2–1 to Ivory Coast and had started taunting the home supporters. The Egyptian fans responded by asking them to leave the stadium and verbally attacking them at half time, and when, despite a plea to stop, it continued into the second half, the riot police were called in. The Libyan Football Association were fined $7,000 by the disciplinary commission of the Confederation of African Football.

A melee broke out on 1 February 2012, after fans of Al-Masry, the home team in Port Said, stormed the field following a rare 3–1 win against Al-Ahly, Egypt&#x27;s top team. Al-Masry supporters attacked the Al-Ahly players and their fans with knives, swords, clubs, stones, bottles, and fireworks. At least 79 people were killed and over 1,000 were injured on both sides in the Mediterranean port city. On 26 January 2013 rioting broke out in Port Said in response to the announcement of death sentences for 21 individuals involved in the February 2012 disturbance. A mob of Al-Masry supporters attempted to storm the prison where the sentenced were held; in the subsequent rioting 74 people were killed, including two police officers, and over 500 were injured.

===Equatorial Guinea===
At the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, at the semi-finals between the host country Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, hooligans invaded the pitch and threw bottles and missiles at the Ghana players.

===Gambia===
Massive riots occurred during and after a Cup of African Nations qualifying game between rival neighbours Senegal and Gambia at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in Dakar, Senegal in June 2003. Gambian supporters hurled missiles towards Senegalese fans and were subsequently charged by soldiers. After the game, violent clashes were reported in both Gambia and Senegal. In Gambia several severe beatings of Senegalese citizens occurred, which led to over 200 Senegalese seeking shelter at their embassy. In Senegal a Gambian BBC reporter was attacked and robbed by a group of youths. The riots eventually led to the closing of the border between Gambia and Senegal until order was restored.

===Ghana===
Up to 125 people died and hundreds were injured when football fans stampeded at a match in Accra in 2001. Accra Hearts were leading 2–1 against Asante Kotoko with five minutes left in the match when some fans began throwing bottles and chairs onto the pitch. Police then fired tear gas into the crowd, sparking a panic. Fans rushed to escape the gas, and in the ensuing crush, up to 125 people were killed.

Asante Kotoko faced a ban after fans assaulted the referee in a CAF Confederation Cup game against Étoile Sportive du Sahel of Tunisia.

===Guinea===
On December 1, 2024, clashes between football fans in N&#x27;Zerekore, Guinea, led to at least 56 deaths after a controversial refereeing decision sparked unrest. Police used tear gas in response, and hospital sources suggested the death toll could exceed 100. Following the violence, demonstrators vandalized a police station. The match was part of a tournament honoring military leader Mamady Doumbouya.

===Ivory Coast===
Fighting among fans at a match on 6 May 2001 led to one death and 39 injuries.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, the most hotly contested rivalry is the Nairobi derby between A.F.C. Leopards and Gor Mahia, both of whose fans are regularly associated with hooliganism. On 18 March 2012, a derby match was held up for over 26 minutes when a riot broke out, leading to destruction of property and several injuries, after Gor Mahia midfielder Ali Abondo was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on Leopards&#x27; defender Amon Muchiri. Gor Mahia were banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from playing in their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season, meaning that the club would not be able to play in either the Nyayo National Stadium or the Moi International Sports Centre. The KPL Board has yet to announce further disciplinary measures on the club.

===Libya===
Eight fans died and 39 were injured when troops opened fire to stop both pro- and anti-Muammar al-Gaddafi sentiments being expressed in a Tripoli stadium during a match between Al Ahli and Al Ittihad in December 1996.

===Mali===
After a World Cup qualifying match between Mali and Togo on 27 March 2005, which Togo won 2–1, Mali fans rioted and went on a spree of destruction and violence. The trouble started when Togo scored the winning goal. Police fired tear gas at Mali fans who had invaded the pitch. The match was abandoned and the win awarded to Togo. The result set off a wave of violence in the capital of Mali, Bamako. Thousands of Mali fans in Bamako began chanting threats toward the Mali players, cars were set on fire, stores looted, property and monuments destroyed and a building housing the local Olympics committee was burned down.

===Mauritius===
In May 1999, seven people died when rioting football fans threw petrol bombs into a casino, following a match in Port Louis between the Mauritian League champions, Scouts Club, and Fire Brigade SC. The incident became knowns as L&#x27;affaire L&#x27;Amicale. After the match which Fire Brigade SC won, hundreds of Scouts fans went on a rampage, attacking police vehicles and torching sugar cane fields.

===Mozambique===
The government of Mozambique apologised for the violent behaviour of Mozambique fans, before, during and after a match between Mozambican club Clube Ferroviário de Maputo and Zimbabwean club Dynamos on 10 May 1998. Ferroviário fans attacked the Dynamo players and the referee, stoned vehicles and fought running battles with riot police outside the stadium. Fifteen people, including four Red Cross workers, needed hospital treatment.

===South Africa===
In Johannesburg, South Africa, on 14 January 1991, forty people died when fans surged toward a jammed exit to escape rival brawling fans at a match southwest of Johannesburg.

On 11 February 2017, a match between Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. and Orlando Pirates F.C. at Loftus Versfeld Stadium was suspended for nearly an hour when Pirates supporters invaded the pitch and clashed with Sundowns fans after Sundowns scored their sixth goal.

These acts led to the loss of net asset value compared to &#x27;book value&#x27; – or impairment – of various assets of the stadium, in terms of the requirements of IAS 36.

===Zimbabwe===
In July 2000 twelve people died following a stampede at a World Cup qualifying match between Zimbabwe and South Africa in Harare. Police fired tear gas when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had taken a two-goal lead. After Delron Buckley scored South Africa&#x27;s second goal bottles began to fly onto the pitch. The police then fired tear gas into the 60,000-person crowd, who began running to the exits to escape the effects of the tear gas. The match had to be abandoned as players from both sides felt the effects of the tear gas and had to receive medical treatment. The police were condemned for firing tear gas. In July 2002, two fans were shot when police opened fire on rioting fans at a match in Bulawayo. Seven police officers were injured and five vehicles badly damaged.

==Oceania==
===Australia===
The incident with the most notoriety in Australia is the Pratten Park riot in 1985 where hundreds of fans stormed the pitch midway through a Sydney Olympic v Sydney City match. In a match between Melbourne Heart and Melbourne Victory in February 2013, 17 plastic seats were destroyed and flares were fired. In a match between Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory in November 2013, one travelling Melbourne Victory fan was hospitalised with a stab wound by a sixteen-year-old civilian. In December 2013, a riot between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers broke out at a pub before the match later that day. 
At an international football friendly between Australia and Serbia in Melbourne in June 2011, fans lit flares both inside and outside the stadium, and in city streets. Banners supporting Ratko Mladić, the Serbian military leader charged with war crimes by the International Court of Justice, were displayed, and a laser pointer was seen in use. In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of unacceptable behaviour by fans. Problems included violence, anti-social behaviour and the lighting of flares.

Although the A-League is relatively young, there are hooligan and casual groups within clubs&#x27; active supporter bases. Although it is nothing like football hooliganism in Europe, anti-social events do occasionally occur. A primary example would be the Bourke Street brawl between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers fans, who gathered in numbers before a match in late 2013 and had a brawl in Melbourne, causing concern among football authorities in Australia. There are small hooligan and casual groups in Australia, the most prominent being from the League&#x27;s biggest fanbases, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers though others exist within other supporter groups.

In 2021, police arrested three men for participating in a riot at a National Premier League soccer match in Sydney.

During a match between Melbourne City FC and Melbourne Victory FC in December 2022, Victory fans stormed the pitch after City goalkeeper Tom Glover threw a flare into the crowd. The flare had initially been thrown onto the ground during a pre-planned walkout, as supporters from multiple clubs at the time were protesting the Australian Professional Leagues decision to sell hosting rights of the league&#x27;s grand final to Sydney. Angered spectators proceeded to rush onto the field, mobbing Glover and referee Alex King. In the midst of the invasion, a metal bucket for disposing of used flares was thrown at Glover&#x27;s head, gashing his face and concussing him. Both teams immediately left the field of play and police dispersed the unruly mob, and the match was abandoned.

===Fiji===
Football hooliganism was banned by the Fiji Football Association in 2020 following two reports of hooliganism at Premier League football matches. The first incident occurred when a Rewa FC player allegedly assaulted a referee in a play-off match against Ba FC. The second incident occurred in Nadi at a match between Nadi FC and Rewa FC, where a group of Nadi fans threatened the referee.

===New Zealand===
In 2023, at a Palmerston North United home match against Gisborne Thistle in the Central Federation League, which Palmerston North United lost 4–2, Palmerston North United midfielder Devon Batchelor was physically assaulted by an opposition player and was taken to hospital. Batchelor was diagnosed with a concussion and required stitches. Football New Zealand condemned the incident.

===Papua New Guinea===
An incident of soccer hooliganism occurred at PNG Football Stadium in Port Moresby in 2023 after a National Soccer League (PNGNSL) semi-final between Gulf Komara and Hekari United. The match resulted in a 2–0 victory for Hekari United, which led fans to storm the pitch.

In 2017, police were called to a national team (Kapuls) training session after people connected with a fake rebel soccer organisation (dubbed by the media as the &quot;Fake Football Federation&quot;) interrupted the training session, which was to prepare for a FIFA World Cup qualifier against the Solomon Islands.

===Solomon Islands===
In 2005, a youth national team match at Lawson Tama Stadium in Honiara between Australia (the &quot;Young Socceroos&quot;) and the Solomon Islands was abandoned in the 77th minute by New Zealand referee Peter O&#x27;Leary due to hooliganism from &quot;several thousand&quot; fans who failed to gain entry (local officials reported that 22,000 spectators were at the match). Australia was winning the match 3–0 until the match was called off.

==Media portrayal==
The portrayal of hooliganism is widespread in the media. A recently released Beckham documentary on Netflix demonstrates an example of this in episode 2: &quot;Seeing Red&quot;. The episode showed a dummy of David Beckham being hung by a noose outside an English pub following his red card against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup.

Football hooliganism has been depicted in films such as &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;EuroTrip&quot;, &quot;Cass&quot;, &quot;The Football Factory&quot;, &quot;Green Street&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Footsoldier&quot; and &quot;Awaydays&quot;. There are also many books about hooliganism, such as &quot;The Football Factory&quot; and &quot;Among the Thugs&quot;. Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.

<text>Sir George Hayter (17 December 1792 – 18 January 1871) was an English painter, specialising in portraits and large works involving sometimes several hundred individual portraits. Queen Victoria appreciated his merits and appointed Hayter her Principal Painter in Ordinary and also awarded him a Knighthood in 1841.

==Early life==

Hayter was the son of Charles Hayter (1761–1835), a miniature painter and popular drawing-master and teacher of perspective who was appointed Professor of Perspective and Drawing to Princess Charlotte and published a well-known introduction to perspective and other works.

Initially tutored by his father, he went to the Royal Academy Schools early in 1808, but in the same year, after a disagreement about his art studies, ran away to sea as a Midshipman in the Royal Navy. His father secured his release, and they came to an agreement that Hayter should assist him while pursuing his own studies.

In 1809 he secretly married Sarah Milton, a lodger at his father&#x27;s house (he was 15 or 16, she 28), the arrangement remaining secret until around 1811. Together they had three children Sophia (born and died 1811), Georgiana (born 1813) and William Henry (born 1814).

At the Royal Academy Schools he studied under Fuseli, and in 1815 was appointed Painter of Miniatures and Portraits by Princess Charlotte. Hayter was awarded the British Institution’s premium for history painting for the Prophet Ezra (1815; Downton Castle), purchased by Richard Payne Knight.

Around 1816 his wife left him, for reasons which are not apparent. He subsequently began a relationship with Louisa Cauty, daughter of Sir William Cauty, with whom he lived openly for the next decade and who bore him two children, Angelo and Louisa.

==Travel to Italy==
Encouraged by his patron, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, he travelled to Italy to study in 1816. There he met Canova, whose studio he attended while painting his portrait, where he absorbed Canova&#x27;s classical style. He is also believed to have learned sculpture from Canova at this time. Canova was Perpetual Principal of the Accademia di San Luca (Rome&#x27;s premier artistic institution) and doubtless put Hayter forward for honorary membership on the strength of his painting ‘The Tribute Money’ which was very favourably received in Rome. Hayter thereby became the Academy&#x27;s youngest ever member.

 Returning to London in 1818, Hayter practised as a portrait painter in oils and history painter. Dubbed ‘The Phoenix’ by William Beckford, Hayter showed a pomposity that irritated his fellow artists, but he mixed freely with many aristocratic families. His unconventional domestic life (separated from his wife, yet living with his mistress) set him apart from official Academy circles: he was never elected to the Royal Academy.

Hayter was most productive and innovative during the 1820s. George Agar-Ellis (later Lord Dover) commissioned &quot;The Trial of Queen Caroline&quot; depicting George IV&#x27;s attempt to divorce Queen Caroline in the House of Lords in 1820 (exh. Cauty&#x27;s Great Rooms, 80-82 Pall Mall, 1823; London, National Portrait Gallery); painted on a large scale (2.33×2.66 m), Hayter&#x27;s first (and most successful) contemporary history painting revealed a taste for high drama effectively realised. In the Trial of William, Lord Russell, in the Old Bailey in 1683 (1825; Woburn Abbey) Hayter celebrated John Russell&#x27;s ancestry, in a work reminiscent of fashionable tableaux vivants of the country-house set.

==Return to the Continent==
In 1826 Hayter settled in Italy. The Banditti of Kurdistan Assisting Georgians in Carrying off Circassian Women (untraced), completed in Florence for John Proby, 1st Earl of Carysfort (exhibited British Institution 1829), demonstrated Hayter&#x27;s assimilation of the style and exotic subject-matter of contemporary French Romantic art.

In 1827 his mistress, Louisa Cauty, died after poisoning herself with arsenic. Although it was apparently an accident, in a bid for attention, it was widely assumed that he had driven her to suicide, and he was forced by the scandal to move from Florence to Rome.

By late 1828 he was in Paris, where his portraits of English society members (some exhibited at the Salon in 1831) were stylistically akin to the work of recent French portrait painters such as François Gérard.

==Royal patronage==
In 1831 Hayter returned to England. His grandiose plan to paint the first sitting after the passage of the Reform Bill resulted in his painting &quot;Moving the Address to the Crown on the Opening of the First Reformed Parliament in the Old House of Commons, 5 February 1833&quot; (1833–1843; London, N.P.G.), for which he executed nearly 400 portrait studies in oil. Hayter was an ardent supporter of the reform movement and this painting was not commissioned but to all intents and purposes a labour of love. It occupied him for ten years with no guarantee of financial reward. This is one of the last images executed of the interior of the old House of Commons before its destruction in the fire of 1834. The painting was finally purchased by the government for the nation in 1854, 20 years after it was started.
Having painted the young Princess Victoria (1832–3; destr.; oil sketch, Brit. Royal Col.), Hayter was not a surprising choice as the new Queen&#x27;s &#x27;Portrait and Historical Painter&#x27;. But on the death of Sir David Wilkie in 1841 Hayter&#x27;s appointment as Principal Painter in Ordinary to the Queen caused some annoyance at the Royal Academy as this appointment had historically been the preserve of the President, then Sir Martin Archer Shee. In 1842 Hayter was knighted. He painted several royal ceremonies including Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation of 1838 and marriage of 1840 and also the Christening of the Prince of Wales of 1843 (all Brit. Royal Col.). He also painted several royal portraits including his most well-known work the State Portrait of the new Queen Victoria. Several versions of this portrait were done, with the assistance of the artist&#x27;s son Angelo, to be sent as diplomatic gifts. Hayter&#x27;s active period at court was short-lived, however, because Albert preferred German painters such as F. X. Winterhalter.

Several significant examples of Hayter&#x27;s works from this period remain a part of the Royal Collection, and both the State Portrait and Wedding painting are among those displayed to the public at Buckingham Palace. There is also a full-scale version of the State Portrait in the National Portrait Gallery and smaller copy at Holyrood House.

==Later years==
 Now in his fifties, Hayter struggled with his health and debts and he sold his Old-Masters and other art works at Christies in May 1845. He planned to move back to the continent but could not after he received severe leg injuries in July 1845 train accident. His wife, Sarah, died in 1844, and on 12 May 1846 he married (Helena) Cecilia Hyde, née Burke (1791/2–1860). After she died in 1860, Hayter married Martha Carey, née Miller (1818–1867) on 23 April 1863. 

By the mid-1840s Hayter&#x27;s portrait style was considered old-fashioned. He adjusted his type of history painting to suit the more literal taste of the early Victorian era (e.g. Wellington Viewing Napoleon&#x27;s Effigy at Madame Tussaud&#x27;s; destr. 1925; engraving, 1854).Hayter painted several large religious paintings including two depicting important Reformist events, &#x27;Bishop Latimer Preaching at Paul&#x27;s Cross&#x27; and &#x27;The Martyrdom of Bishops Ridley and Latimer&#x27; (exh. 1855), both of which were given to the Art Museum, Princeton University, USA in 1984. He painted several biblical scenes from the Old and New Testament, among them The Angels Ministering to Christ in 1849 (V&amp;A) and Joseph Interpreting the Baker&#x27;s Dream in 1854 (Lancaster City Museums). He also produced fluent landscape watercolours (many of Italian views), etchings (he published a volume in 1833), decorative designs and sculpture.

On 18 January 1871 Hayter died at his home in London. He was buried in St Marylebone cemetery in East Finchley. The contents of Hayter&#x27;s studio were auctioned at Christie&#x27;s, London, on 19 April 1871.

His younger brother, John (1800–1895), was also an artist, known chiefly as a portrait draughtsman in chalks and crayons and his younger sister Anne worked as a miniaturist. Some sources say that the influential printmaker Stanley William Hayter was a direct descendant from John Hayter, although others say the ancestor was Sir George Hayter himself. However the family tree of John and George Hayter published in Crisps Visitations shows no possible link to SW Hayter. What is known for certain is that the French painter and writer, Jean René Bazaine was a great great grandson of George Hayter, through his eldest daughter Georgiana Elizabeth, who married Pierre-Dominique Bazaine older brother of Marshal Bazaine.

<text>Myrmicinae is a subfamily of ants, with about 140 extant genera; their distribution is cosmopolitan. The pupae lack cocoons. Some species retain a functional sting. The petioles of Myrmicinae consist of two nodes. The nests are permanent and in soil, rotting wood, under stones, or in trees.

== Identification ==
Myrmicine worker ants have a distinct postpetiole, i.e., abdominal segment III is notably smaller than segment IV and set off from it by a well-developed constriction; the pronotum is inflexibly fused to the rest of the mesosoma, such that the promesonotal suture is weakly impressed or absent, and a functional sting is usually present. The clypeus is well-developed; as a result, the antennal sockets are well separated from the anterior margin of the head. Most myrmicine genera possess well-developed eyes and frontal lobes that partly conceal the antennal insertions.

== Tribes ==
Recently, the number of tribes was reduced from 25 to six:

*Attini 
*Crematogastrini 
*Myrmicini 
*Pogonomyrmecini 
*Solenopsidini 
*Stenammini

<text>Thomas Balogh, Baron Balogh (2 November 190520 January 1985), born Balog Tamás, was a British economist and member of the House of Lords.

The elder son of a wealthy Budapest Jewish family (his father was head of public transport, his mother the daughter of a professor), Balogh studied at the Minta Gymnasium, considered &#x27;the Eton of Hungarian youth&#x27;, then at the universities of Budapest and Berlin. He took a two-year research position at Harvard University as a Rockefeller Fellow in 1928. Following this, Balogh worked in banking in Paris, Berlin and Washington before coming to England.

After getting British citizenship in 1938, he became a lecturer at Balliol College, Oxford, and was elected to a Fellowship in 1945, then became Reader in 1960. He was also the economic correspondent for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, an economic adviser to Harold Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet office following the 1964 Labour Party victory, and member of the Secretariat of the League of Nations.

As an advisor in the Cabinet Office after 1964, Balogh was a critic of consumption- and profit-orientated tax policies, arguing that &quot;profit can be earned not merely by satisfying long felt wants more efficiently and in a better fashion, but also by creating new wants through artificially engendered satisfaction and the suggestion of status symbols&quot;, instead arguing that nationalisation was a better means of securing wage restraint and a more equitable tax system as a whole. Balogh was opposed to Britain&#x27;s entry of the EEC.

Balogh was created a Life Peer as Baron Balogh, &quot;of Hampstead in Greater London&quot; on 20 June 1968.

Brian Harrison recorded an oral history interview with Balogh, in May 1977, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews.&quot; In the interview Balogh talks about his friendship with Eva Hubback. 

He was married twice: firstly in 1945 to Penelope Noel Mary Ingram Tower (daughter of Rev. Henry Bernard Tower, Vicar of Swinbrook, Oxfordshire, and widow of Oliver Gatty, a Balliol Fellow, by whom she had a daughter, Tirril), a psychotherapist, with whom he had two sons and a daughter; secondly in 1970 to Catherine (née Cole, previously married to Anthony Storr), a psychiatrist and author.

<doc id="1138897" wikidata="Q2912529" url="?curid=1138897" title="Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood">
<text>Colonel Josiah Clement Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood, (16 March 1872 – 26 July 1943), sometimes referred to as Josiah Wedgwood IV, was a British Liberal and Labour politician who served in government under Ramsay MacDonald. He was a prominent single-tax activist following the political-economic reformer Henry George. He was the great-great-grandson of potter Josiah Wedgwood.

==Background==
Josiah Wedgwood was born at Barlaston in Staffordshire, the son of Clement Wedgwood. He was the great-great-grandson of potter Josiah Wedgwood. His mother Emily Catherine was the daughter of engineer James Meadows Rendel. He was educated at Clifton College and then studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.

He married his first cousin Ethel Kate Bowen (1869–1952), daughter of Sir Charles Bowen, 1st Baron Bowen, in 1894 but she left him in 1913 and divorced him in 1919. Since divorce at that time required a guilty party, he agreed to take the blame and was found guilty of adultery and desertion of his wife and children, which led to criticism from the press and pulpit. More criticism was levelled after the divorce was final and he revealed that the desertion was a formality and the adultery staged. They had seven children:

*Helen Bowen Wedgwood (1895–1981), married geneticist Michael Pease, son of Edward Reynolds Pease. One of their sons was physicist Bas Pease and one of their daughters, Jocelyn Richenda Gammell Pease (1925–2003), married biologist Andrew Huxley.
*Rosamund Wedgwood (1896–1960)
*Francis Charles Bowen Wedgwood (1898–1959), 2nd Baron Wedgwood. He was father of the 3rd Baron.
*Josiah Wedgwood V (1899–1968), managing director of Wedgwood. He was father of Dr John Wedgwood (1919–2007), former heir presumptive to the barony.
*Camilla Hildegarde Wedgwood (1901–1955), anthropologist
*Elizabeth Julia Wedgwood (1907–1993)
*Gloria Wedgwood (1909–1974)

In 1919 he remarried; his second wife was Florence Ethel Willett (1878–1969).

==Military and political career==
His mother&#x27;s family was involved both financially and in the management of Elswick Shipyards and Armstrongs Armament manufacturers in Newcastle upon Tyne. Josiah was sent to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich to study Naval Architecture before going to work at Elswick.

He worked for a year from 1895 as an Assistant Naval Constructor in Portsmouth before returning to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to head Armstrong&#x27;s drawing office.

In 1891, he was commissioned in the 1st Northumberland (Western Division, Royal Artillery). Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899 he was given the army rank of captain on 3 March 1900, and for three years commanded a volunteer battery of the Royal Field Artillery equipped with naval guns. He returned to South Africa after the war, spending two years as a Resident Magistrate in the Ermelo district in the Transvaal. His studies of native land laws gave him an interest in Land Reform and later, influenced by the writings of Henry George, he developed a lifelong belief in the Single Tax, advocating a tax on property to replace taxes on income and goods as a way of securing for workers the full reward for their work. He became president of the League for the Taxation of Land Values in 1908.

Having returned to England, Wedgwood was elected as member of parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at the 1906 general election. Though he stood for the Liberal Party, he made it clear that he would take an independent line in Parliament if necessary, in accordance with his conscience. He was re-elected at both the January and December 1910 elections, and that year was also elected to Staffordshire County Council, remaining a councillor until 1918. He became disillusioned with the Liberals after 1910, when it became clear that the government would not honour campaign commitments to land reform and opposing vested interests. His disillusionment was increased by the government&#x27;s reaction against the Suffragettes, whom he also supported. In 1913 he staged a filibuster against the government&#x27;s Mental Deficiency Bill, which he saw as authoritarian and unjust.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, holding the rank of lieutenant-commander. He returned to mechanical work and was posted to the Armoured Car Section of the Royal Naval Air Service. He served in Belgium and France in 1914 with the armoured cars. He was wounded in the Dardanelles Campaign in 1915, receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service during the landing at Cape Helles, commanding the machine guns on SS &quot;River Clyde&quot;. It was while serving at Gallipoli that he met volunteers of the Zion Mule Corps commanded by Joseph Trumpeldor that would affect his views about British policy on Palestine. Back in Parliament he expressed concern at under-staffing and support for national service, though he also defended the rights of conscientious objectors. Later that year he was posted as an army captain to the staff of General Jan Smuts in East Africa. In 1916 he was part of the Mesopotamia Commission of Inquiry.

Promoted to Major he commanded a machine gun company in the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade in 1916. In 1917 he became Assistant Director of Trench Warfare with the rank of colonel. At the start of 1918 he was sent to Siberia where his mission was to encourage continued Russian participation in the war and to gathering intelligence on Bolshevik control in Siberia.

===1918 General Election===
In the 1918 General Election he sought re-election. There has been some confusion regarding his specific affiliation at the time of the election. He was officially supported by his local Liberal Association and he was officially endorsed by the Coalition Government. This led to him being described in many sources at the time as a Coalition Liberal. However, during the election campaign he publicly distanced himself from the Coalition Government. His own local election campaign was minimal because he was not opposed. In his election address he stated &quot;I come before you, the same impenitent independent radical that you first elected in 1906&quot;. This had led some to incorrectly describe him in 1918 as an &#x27;Independent Radical&#x27; even though in 1906 he was classified as a &#x27;Liberal&#x27;. The usually reliable F. W. S. Craig, in his book &quot;British Parliamentary Election results, 1918-1949&quot; described him as an &#x27;Independent Liberal&#x27;. However his status as an official Liberal rather than an Independent Liberal was subsequently confirmed when he attended the first meeting of the Liberal parliamentary party on 3 February 1919.

===Joining Labour===
In 1919, Wedgwood took the Labour whip in the House of Commons and joined the Independent Labour Party. He enjoyed the freer atmosphere of Labour and the party warmly welcomed him, electing him joint vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party in 1921. Wedgwood maintained his reputation for championing new ideas and the interests of outsiders and underdogs. He supported a number of unpopular causes, including opposition to the reparations from Germany contained in the Treaty of Versailles. In 1920 he criticised the government&#x27;s partition of British territories into Palestine and Transjordan, and continued to attack what he saw as its bias against Zionism for the next two decades. That year he also led a commission from the Labour Party and the TUC to Hungary, which reported on the harsh treatment of suspected communists under the Horthy regime that succeeded the revolutionary Communist dictatorship of Béla Kun. He supported refugee causes in Britain, particularly that of anarchists from the Soviet Union, such as Emma Goldman. Most of all he became known for his support of the Indian independence movement.

===Cabinet and the Lords===

There was tacit co-operation between Labour and the opposition Liberals in some seats at the 1923 general election, and Wedgwood ran unopposed in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Having been re-elected vice-chairman of the party in 1922 and 1923, Wedgwood expected a seat in the Cabinet when Labour formed its first government at the start of 1924. There was speculation in the press that he would be made First Lord of the Admiralty and some expectation that he would become Secretary of State for the Colonies or for India. Sidney Webb believed Wedgwood would prefer to become President of the Board of Trade, and was willing to step aside in his favour. However, Ramsay MacDonald initially offered him only the junior position of Financial Secretary to the Treasury. After some pressing, MacDonald gave him a seat in the Cabinet, but with the sinecure title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster rather than a departmental portfolio. In this capacity, he performed various de facto tasks in government. Later in the year, he was appointed Chief Industrial Commissioner, succeeding Arthur Henderson in a difficult position as the government&#x27;s decision to maintain some of its predecessor&#x27;s policies on industrial action caused much friction within the Labour movement. He was sworn into the Privy Council in 1924.

He chaired a cabinet committee to contemplate the use of the Emergency Powers Act against strikes in the transport industry. He took a strong line on a number of issues, opposing disarmament and the promise of a loan to the Soviet Union. He was also wary of the state undertaking public works purely for the sake of doing so, without any utilitarian benefit.

After the fall of the government, Wedgwood publicly criticised MacDonald&#x27;s leadership and Labour&#x27;s reliance on civil servants. He sat on Labour&#x27;s front bench in opposition, speaking on, amongst other policy areas, local government, where he encouraged Clement Attlee. He was not offered a position in the second Labour government. In March 1929, he became chairman of the House of Commons Records Committee. He began compiling a history of the Commons, a subject that consumed his interest. He wrote a history of Staffordshire&#x27;s parliamentary representatives from the thirteenth century to the First World War, and two volumes of biographies of MPs of the 15th century. Wedgwood&#x27;s work in this area led eventually to the establishment of the History of Parliament Trust. Throughout the 1930s, he continued to speak in the Commons on issues of importance to him, particularly the Single Tax and native resistance to colonialism. In 1930 and 1931 he was made Mayor of Newcastle-under-Lyme after successfully campaigning for the town to remain independent of Stoke-on-Trent.

From the mid-1930s he was critical of appeasement and of limitations on the migration of Jews to Palestine (1939 White Paper) and of German refugees to Britain and worked tirelessly to help European Jews. The actor Heinz Bernard&#x27;s life was saved as a result of a parliamentary question asked by Wedgwood which resulted in his being given a visa to Britain.

In the Second World War, he joined the Home Guard in 1940. In the same year, when Winston Churchill made his famous &#x27;We shall never surrender&#x27; speech in the House of Commons (4 June, 1940), Wedgwood wrote to him and said: “That was worth 1,000 guns, and the speeches of 1,000 years.”

In 1941 Wedgwood toured the United States of America, putting Britain&#x27;s case against Germany at public meetings. Whilst Wedgwood was in America, Winston Churchill offered him a peerage, inviting him to sit for Labour in the House of Lords. Wedgwood accepted, resigning as MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme after 36 years and becoming Baron Wedgwood, of Barlaston in the County of Stafford on 21 January 1942. The following year he died in London aged 71.

==Zionism==
Wedgwood was impressed by his contact with the Zion Mule Corps in 1915, while serving in World War I, and said that he first became aware of Zionism &quot;as a creed&quot; in 1916 when Dorothy Richardson invited him to address a Zionist meeting. In October 1926, Wedgwood, a devoted Zionist, visited Palestine and challenged the Mandatory government&#x27;s policies in his 1928 book &quot;The Seventh Dominion&quot;, accusing the British administration of hindering the country&#x27;s social and economic development.

In 1942 he prefaced the booklet &quot;STOP THEM NOW&quot;, the first public report printed in English about the non-stop destruction of the Jews in German-occupied territories, in which he says : &quot;The Huns and the Mongols, Tamerlane with his mountains of skulls, all these demons of long ago were patterns of chivalry compared with the pureblooded devils into which Hitler has converted Germans.&quot;

==Legacy and commemoration==

<text>Cepheus is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon, within one crater diameter of the larger crater Franklin to the southeast. To the north-north-east is the flooded crater Oersted. The proximity of this formation to the lunar limb means it appears oblong when viewed from the Earth due to foreshortening.

This is a relatively young formation, and the rim is still sharp and well-defined. The exception is an even younger, bowl-shaped crater that lies across the northeast rim. This is a satellite crater designated Cepheus A. The remaining rim is nearly circular, with outward bulges to the north and south. The inner wall is terraced in places, most notably along the northwest wall. There is a central peak formation at the midpoint of the floor which stretches somewhat to the north and south.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cepheus.

<text>Iolanda Balaș (, , later &quot;Balázs-Sőtér Jolán&quot;; 12 December 1936 – 11 March 2016) was a Romanian athlete, an Olympic champion and former world record holder in the high jump. She was the first Romanian woman to win an Olympic gold medal and is considered to have been one of the greatest high jumpers of the twentieth century.

==Early life==
Balaș was born in Timișoara to an ethnic Hungarian family. Her mother, Etel Bozó was a homemaker, while her father, Frigyes, was originally a locksmith. Her father served in the Hungarian army until he was captured and brought to the Soviet Union and later back to Hungary, where he settled in Budapest. Balaș tried to reunite the family and move to Hungary, but although she managed to obtain a Hungarian passport in 1947, she was not allowed to leave Romania. When asked in an interview in 2005 whether she had ever thought about defection, she said that it had crossed her mind; however, as it could have resulted in serious retaliation against her relatives, she did not want to risk it. In the interview she said, &quot;I feel sorry that I did not win Olympics for Hungary. But a person represents herself and after that a nation. It was not given for me to bear the Hungarian colors, to make happy those who speak my mother tongue. It evolved this way and I feel sorry for it, but I would have gone mad if I would thought constantly about this contradictory situation. I hope that besides Romanians also Hungarians are proud of me.&quot;

==Career==

Balaș took up athletics owing to her caretaker Luisa Ernst, who was also a retired high jumper. In 1953 she transferred from Timișoara club &quot;Electrica&quot; to CCA (CSA Steaua). After finishing fifth in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, she won Olympic gold medals at Rome in 1960 (becoming the first Romanian woman to do so) and Tokyo in 1964. At the 1964 Olympics she competed with a torn tendon, which forced her later to withdraw from the 1966 European Championships. Nevertheless, between 1957 and 1966, Balaș won 154 consecutive competitions, not including qualifying competitions or exhibitions. She improved the world record 14 times, from 1.75 m to 1.91 m, and equalled it once outdoors and once indoors. She was the first woman to jump over six feet. Her technique was a sophisticated version of the scissors technique.

Balaș won two British WAAA Championships high jump titles at the 1962 WAAA Championships and the 1963 WAAA Championships.

Her record of 1.91 m, set in 1961, lasted until the end of 1971 (beaten by Ilona Gusenbauer from Austria), when jumpers with a more efficient technique (the straddle technique, and later the Fosbury style) took over.
After retiring from competition in 1967, Balaș married her former coach Ioan Söter, and taught physical education in Bucharest. Between 1988 and 2005 she was president of the Romanian Athletics Federation. She was also a member of the technical committee of the European Athletics Association, and in 1995 was elected to the women&#x27;s commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).

==Death==

Balaș was diagnosed with type II diabetes several years before her death and was hospitalized several times after that. She died following gastric complications at Elias Hospital in Bucharest, Romania, at the age of 79. She is buried at Ghencea Cemetery in Bucharest.

==Awards==

Balaș was named an honorary citizen of Timișoara (in 1999) and of Bucharest (in 2001). In 2010, she received the royal decoration &quot;Nihil Sine Deo&quot; for special merits to the Romanian sports from Michael I of Romania, in a ceremony held at the Elisabeta Palace in Bucharest, for the way she led the Romanian Athletics Federation and to promote Romanian excellence in sport and young athletes. In 2000, &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; voted Balaș as the best female high jumper of the 20th century. She was inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.

<doc id="1138904" wikidata="Q944515" url="?curid=1138904" title="Alba Fucens">
<text>Alba Fucens was an ancient Italic town located at elevation at the base of Monte Velino, approximately north of Avezzano, Abruzzo, central Italy. Its ruins can be found in the &quot;comune&quot; of Massa d&#x27;Albe.

The city is largely visible after excavation and is probably the most important ancient site in Abruzzo.

==History==


It was originally a town of the Aequi, though on the frontier of the Marsi, but was occupied by a Latin colony (303-4 BC) owing to its strategic importance. 
Initially it was populated by 6,000 settlers who built a wall in the years immediately following their settlement. The following year they had to defend themselves from the attacks of the Aequi who, unable to tolerate the presence of a fortified Latin citadel on their territory, tried to conquer it without success.

It lay on a hill just to the north of the Via Valeria, which was prolonged beyond Tibur probably at this very period. In the Second Punic War Alba at first remained faithful and in 211 BC sent a contingent of 2,000 men to help Rome, but afterwards refused to send contingents and was punished.

After this it became a regular place of detention for important state prisoners such as Syphax of Numidia, Perseus of Macedonia, Bituitus, king of the Arverni.

It was attacked by the allies in the Social War, but remained faithful to Rome; and its strong position rendered it a place of some importance in the civil wars. In the struggle between Sulla and Marius, the city sided with the latter and at the end of the conflict Sulla, to punish it and at the same time satisfy the requests of one of his lieutenants, Metellus Pius, distributed part of the territory of Alba Fucens to the latter&#x27;s veterans.

In the conflict between Caesar and Pompey, it hosted a garrison of six cohorts of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC) then surrendered to the legions of Caesar.

In 44 BC, the legion Martia (enrolled from the Marsi) mutinied against the consul Mark Antony and went over to the side of Octavian. The Martia, leaving the coast road at Aternum, took the Via Valeria and went to Alba Fucens, which due to its strategic position made it possible to maintain contact with Octavian and, if necessary, prevent Antony from passing through towards the Adriatic.

Cicero said of the incident:
Now this legion [the Martia] is quartered in Alba Fucens. What other city could one choose, well fortified and nearby, or more suitable for its natural position for military operations, or more faithful, or inhabited by braver or more attached citizens to our Republic?

Its prosperity, in the imperial period, is testified by the inscriptions found. One of particular importance relates to the fate of the nearby Fucino river which dried up following the building of the Tunnels of Claudius to drain the lake in the 1st century by the emperor Claudius.

In 537 it was occupied by the Byzantines during the Gothic war, its last mention in history by Procopius of Caesarea.

The town was completely destroyed by the Saracens in the 10th century.

==Buildings==


The city streets and many buildings built on a Hippodamian orthogonal plan are clearly exposed. On the northern side is a large terrace surrounded by a portico attached to an exedra.

The city walls of about 3 km circumference are well preserved and constructed of polygonal masonry of uncertain date; the blocks are carefully jointed, and the faces smoothed. The arrangement of the gates is clearly traceable; as a rule they come at the end of a long, straight stretch of wall, and are placed so as to leave the right side of any attacking force exposed. On the north is, for a length of about 150 m, a triple line of defences of later date (possibly added by the Roman colonists), as both the city wall proper, and the double wall thrown out in front of it are partly constructed of concrete, and faced with finer polygonal masonry.

The forum (142 x 44 m) was overlooked by the basilica built (end of the 2nd century BC to first decades of the following century), the macellum (market) from the same era and the baths of the late Republican age, but enlarged in the imperial era. The baths were decorated with precious mosaics depicting marine scenes and subjects.

The well-preserved amphitheatre (96 x 79 m) from the reign of Tiberius was built by the Prefect of the Praetorium Nevius Sutorius Macro, born in Alba. There are numerous houses belonging to the local patricians including a &quot;domus&quot;. On the side of the Pettorino hill are the remains of the Roman theatre&#x27;s cavea.

Remains of the 10 km long Roman aqueduct, built as early as the 1st century BC, are visible especially of the siphon-bridge in the locality of Arci, 1.5 km NE of the town. Its source was the Sant&#x27;Eugenia spring beyond the pass of Fonte Capo la Maina near the hamlet of Santa Jona. The last 3 km was unusually built using a pressured pipeline as an inverted siphon across a valley. At Arci is the venter of the inverted siphon, an embankment 12 m wide and over 130 m long increasing in height with the valley depth and at the deepest point was a bridge with arches carrying the pipes to reduce the depth of the siphon and hence the water pressure and associated leakage.

In the urban centre were the temple of Isis and the sanctuary of Hercules. The hill at the western end of the town was occupied by the Temple of Apollo of the Tuscan order from the 2nd c. BC, the remarkable remains of which are incorporated in a beautiful Romanesque church of San Pietro which contains some Cosmatesque mosaics. It is the only monastic church in Abruzzo in which the central nave is separated from the lateral ones by ancient columns.

The collegiate church of S. Nicola contains a remarkable staurotheca of the 11th century, and a wooden triptych in imitation of the Byzantine style with enamels, of the 13th century.

==Excavations==

Discovered in 1949 after excavations carried out by the Belgian University of Louvain, the project led to a series of publications of the site.

The statue of Venus and other finds are at the National Museum of the Abruzzi at Chieti.

Since 2007 new excavations have been led by Brussels University, and amongst the most spectacular finds were a painted calendar and fasti.

<text>Fabry is a large lunar impact crater of the form termed a walled plain. It is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the northeastern limb. Parts of this area are sometimes brought into view by the effects of libration, but the terrain is seen from the edge and so not much in the way of detail can be observed.

This formation is of significant dimensions in its own right, but it overlies the northeast rim of an even larger basin named Harkhebi. To the west is the crater Vashakidze, and east of Fabry is the small Petrie. Northwards lies Swann.

The outer rim of Fabry is heavily worn and eroded, with notches from subsequent impacts. A pair of small craters, including Fabry H, lies along the eastern rim. Smaller craters lie along many parts of this remaining rim, most notably a small crater across the southern rim, and a short, hook-shaped valley cutting across the northwest rim. Only a few sections of the rim remain relatively intact, while the remainder is merely a ring of mountainous terrain.

Sections of the interior floor are relatively smooth and level, but the surface is rough and irregular in the northeast quadrant. There is a central peak formed from a long massif that covers nearly a quarter of the crater diameter from west to east. At the southeast end of this formation is a small crater, located just to the southeast of the midpoint. The remainder of the floor has been resurfaced, and now is marked only by tiny craterlets and the rough ground along the edge of the rim.

Ray material from the young crater Giordano Bruno to the south carries across the floor of Harkhebi, and lies in a few faint patches on the floor of Fabry. This is most notable in the southern part of the crater to the south of the small crater near the midpoint.

Prior to formal naming in 1970 by the IAU, this crater was known as &quot;Crater 45&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fabry.

<doc id="1138907" wikidata="Q496287" url="?curid=1138907" title="Animotion">
<text>Animotion is an American synth-pop band from Los Angeles, California, best known for the songs &quot;Obsession&quot;, &quot;Let Him Go&quot;, &quot;I Engineer&quot;, and &quot;Room to Move&quot;. Formed in 1983 from the remnants of a retro science-fiction band called Red Zone, they signed a record deal with Mercury Records in 1984 and released four studio albums.

==History==

=== Formation and rise (1983–1986) ===
Animotion was founded by four former members of Los Angeles-based band Red Zone and the lead singer of the Billy Bond band. Both Red Zone and the Billy Bond Band would play at the popular music venue Madame Wong&#x27;s and knew of each other. A manager who heard that Red Zone were considering breaking up suggested that Billy Bond Band vocalist Bill Wadhams look into working with them, and particularly their vocalist Astrid Plane. After Wadhams demonstrated some of his original material to the group, the two parties decided to form a new band with the name &quot;Animotion&quot; suggested by Astrid to convey energy and motion.

The initial line-up was made up of dual lead vocalists in Wadhams and Plane, keyboardist Paul Antonelli, bassist Charles Ottavio, and drummer David &quot;Frenchy&quot; O&#x27;Brien. With Wadhams already handling some guitar duties, lead guitarist Don Kirkpatrick was brought into the band to supplement their sound. The now-six-piece lineup recorded their 1984 self-titled debut album, further augmented by session keyboardist Greg Smith. Released near the end of the year, a single from this album, &quot;Obsession&quot;, written by hit American songwriter Holly Knight and noted British singer/actor Michael Des Barres (who originally cut the song themselves as &quot;Knight and Des Barres&quot; for the 1983 movie &quot;A Night in Heaven&quot;), became a worldwide success and the band&#x27;s first US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top Ten single, peaking early the following year. The follow-up single from this album, &quot;Let Him Go&quot;, also cracked the US Top 40 after being remixed to sound more like its predecessor.

Following the departures of Antonelli and O&#x27;Brien, Smith became an official member of the band, along with new drummer Jim Blair, prior to the recording of the follow-up album, &quot;Strange Behavior&quot; (1986). While several singles were released from this album, its success in the US paled in comparison to the debut album, whereas the band became very famous in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and South Africa, thanks to the LP&#x27;s single &quot;I Engineer&quot;, another Holly Knight composition which was co-written with Bernie Taupin and Mike Chapman. &quot;I Engineer&quot; reached the Top 20 (and sometimes as high as the Top 5) in those countries. During 1986 and 1987 Animotion toured extensively, appearing alongside such performers as Phil Collins, Depeche Mode, Eurythmics, Genesis, Howard Jones, INXS, and Simply Red.

=== Departures and decline (1987–1990) ===
In the midst of recording their third album, Animotion went through personnel changes, as all three of the remaining founding members (Ottavio, Plane, and Wadhams) departed, along with Blair. The split was not amicable; Ottavio and Plane (who by this point were a couple, and later married) were fired from the band at the behest of the management, while Wadhams&#x27; departure was the culmination of a refusal of the record label to allow him to continue to write songs for the band (on their first album he had served as principal songwriter and, along with Kirkpatrick and Smith, had performed the same role on the second), a condition which he felt uncomfortable with. 

Actress/dancer/singer Cynthia Rhodes replaced Plane as female lead singer, and former solo artist/Device member Paul Engemann replaced Wadhams as the male lead for Animotion&#x27;s second self-titled album, informally known as &quot;Room to Move&quot; (due to the success of this song) to distinguish it from their first LP. Incidentally, Engemann&#x27;s former band, Device, had also included Holly Knight (co-writer of &quot;Obsession&quot;). By the time of this third album&#x27;s release, only Kirkpatrick and Smith remained officially in the &quot;band&quot; along with Rhodes and Engemann, and a slew of session musicians contributed to the recording. The single &quot;Room to Move&quot;, a remake of a 1988 song by the group Climie Fisher, became a radio hit in April 1989, and the band&#x27;s second Top 10 hit in the US, aided by its inclusion in the movie &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;. However, the album itself did not crack the top 100 on the charts, and Animotion broke up afterwards.

===Reformation (2001–present)===

Several of the original members reunited on February 8, 2001, in response to a request from Alex Hart and 94.7 NRK Radio Station in Portland, Oregon, performing for a sold-out crowd. Plane, Wadhams, Kirkpatrick, and Smith have continued to perform as Animotion since this time; with drummer Kevin Rankin joining them in 2002, and Bill&#x27;s son Chris Wadhams joining as bass player in 2011. Don Kirkpatrick also plays in Rod Stewart&#x27;s band. When he is unavailable, Portland, Oregon guitarist Kevin Hahn deputizes in the position. They have performed many shows with A Flock of Seagulls, Wang Chung, Berlin and the Motels in recent years.

In the summer of 2005, Ottavio made a guest appearance alongside Plane and Wadhams who appeared as Animotion in the American version of the TV show &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time,&quot; performing their hit &quot;Obsession&quot; and a cover of Dirty Vegas&#x27; &quot;Days Go By&quot;.

In 2014, Wadhams heard a remix of &quot;Obsession&quot; by a Colorado DJ named Joman. After reaching out to the DJ, Joman offered to remix new material from the band. Wadhams sent a recording of &quot;Raise&quot; and the remixed product was used to obtain a record deal with Invisible Hands Music in London. After 26 years, the band—featuring core members Plane, Wadhams, Kirkpatrick, and Smith—released a new album entitled &quot;Raise&quot;, which was released in 2016 in the UK and a month later on January 20, 2017 (as &quot;Raise Your Expectations&quot;) in the US. Joman&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Raise&quot; along with Animotion&#x27;s classic &quot;Let Him Go&quot; are featured on the album. A music video, directed by producer Chuck Kentis&#x27; son Noah, was made for the song &quot;Last Time&quot;; it features a mix of live-action and animated elements. The album cover was created by Jay Vigon, who created Animotion&#x27;s original logo and the logo for Prince&#x27;s film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.

The band&#x27;s original drummer, David &quot;Frenchy&quot; O&#x27;Brien (born May 23, 1947 in Worcester, Massachusetts), died on January 13, 2019, at age 71.

In January 2023, a US show was announced: the band played at the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California on May 20, 2023.

<doc id="1138909" wikidata="Q1911715" url="?curid=1138909" title="Maury (crater)">
<text>Maury is a small lunar impact crater named for two cousins. It was first named in honor of Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury of the U. S. Naval Observatory and later shared to honor Antonia Maury of Harvard College Observatory. The crater lies in the northeastern part of the Moon, just to the east of the Lacus Somniorum. The nearest named craters are Hall to the southwest, and Cepheus farther to the northeast. Just to the west of Maury is the lava-flooded remains of the satellite crater Maury C.

This is a young bowl-shaped crater with a circular rim and a tiny flat floor at the midpoint. The surface of the floor has a cluster of small hills. The inner walls appear lighter than the surrounding terrain due to higher albedo. This is normal for recently formed craters, and the interior will gradually grow darker due to space weathering.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maury.

<doc id="1138912" wikidata="Q5275357" url="?curid=1138912" title="Differential of the first kind">
<text>In mathematics, differential of the first kind is a traditional term used in the theories of Riemann surfaces (more generally, complex manifolds) and algebraic curves (more generally, algebraic varieties), for everywhere-regular differential 1-forms. Given a complex manifold &quot;M&quot;, a differential of the first kind ω is therefore the same thing as a 1-form that is everywhere holomorphic; on an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; that is non-singular it would be a global section of the coherent sheaf Ω1 of Kähler differentials. In either case the definition has its origins in the theory of abelian integrals.

The dimension of the space of differentials of the first kind, by means of this identification, is the Hodge number

:&quot;h&quot;1,0.

The differentials of the first kind, when integrated along paths, give rise to integrals that generalise the elliptic integrals to all curves over the complex numbers. They include for example the hyperelliptic integrals of type

: formula_1

where &quot;Q&quot; is a square-free polynomial of any given degree &gt; 4. The allowable power &quot;k&quot; has to be determined by analysis of the possible pole at the point at infinity on the corresponding hyperelliptic curve. When this is done, one finds that the condition is

:&quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;g&quot; − 1,

or in other words, &quot;k&quot; at most 1 for degree of &quot;Q&quot; 5 or 6, at most 2 for degree 7 or 8, and so on (as &quot;g&quot; = [(1+ deg &quot;Q&quot;)/2]).

Quite generally, as this example illustrates, for a compact Riemann surface or algebraic curve, the Hodge number is the genus &quot;g&quot;. For the case of algebraic surfaces, this is the quantity known classically as the irregularity &quot;q&quot;. It is also, in general, the dimension of the Albanese variety, which takes the place of the Jacobian variety.

==Differentials of the second and third kind==
The traditional terminology also included differentials of the second kind and of the third kind. The idea behind this has been supported by modern theories of algebraic differential forms, both from the side of more Hodge theory, and through the use of morphisms to commutative algebraic groups.

The Weierstrass zeta function was called an &quot;integral of the second kind&quot; in elliptic function theory; it is a logarithmic derivative of a theta function, and therefore has simple poles, with integer residues. The decomposition of a (meromorphic) elliptic function into pieces of &#x27;three kinds&#x27; parallels the representation as (i) a constant, plus (ii) a linear combination of translates of the Weierstrass zeta function, plus (iii) a function with arbitrary poles but no residues at them.

The same type of decomposition exists in general, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, though the terminology is not completely consistent. In the algebraic group (generalized Jacobian) theory the three kinds are abelian varieties, algebraic tori, and affine spaces, and the decomposition is in terms of a composition series.

On the other hand, a meromorphic abelian differential of the &quot;second kind&quot; has traditionally been one with residues at all poles being zero. One of the third kind is one where all poles are simple. There is a higher-dimensional analogue available, using the Poincaré residue.

<doc id="1138915" wikidata="Q586646" url="?curid=1138915" title="Monte Massico">
<text>Monte Massico (Latin: &quot;Mons Massicus&quot;) is a mountain situated in the Italian Province of Caserta (Campania) between the rivers Volturno and Garigliano.

==Description==
Monte Massico is an Italian mountain ridge. In antiquity, it was described as being in the territory of the Aurunci, and on the border of Campania and Latium Adiectum, but attributed by most authors to the latter.

It projects south-west from the volcanic system of Rocca Monfina (see Suessa Aurunca) as far as the sea, and separates the lower course of the Liris from the plain of Campania. It consists of limestone, with a superstratum of pliocenic and volcanic masses, and was once an island; its highest point is 811 meters (2661 feet) above sea-level.

It was famous for its Falernian wine in ancient times. There was just room along the coast for the road to pass through; the pass was guarded by the Auruncan town of Vescia (probably on the mountain side), which ceased to exist in 314 BC after the defeat of the Ausones, but left its name to the spot. Its successor, Sinuessa, on the coast, a station on the Via Appia, was constructed in 312 BC, and a colony was founded there in 295 BC.

It was mentioned by classical writers as a place in which travellers halted. Here Virgil joined Horace on the famous journey to Brundisium. Domitian considerably increased its importance by the construction of the Via Domitiana, which left the Via Appia here and ran to Cumae and Puteoli, and it was he, no doubt, who raised it to the position of colonia Flavia. The town was destroyed by the Saracens, but some ruins of it are still visible two miles north-west of the modern village of Mondragone - the mineral springs which still rise here were frequented in antiquity.

<text>Kyran Paul Patrick Bracken MBE (born 22 November 1971) is a world-cup winning former rugby union footballer who played at scrum-half for Saracens, Bristol and Waterloo.

He won a total of 51 England caps and captained the team on three occasions, retiring from international rugby in 2004.

==Early life==
Bracken was born in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a dentist and his mother had played hockey for Ireland. They originally lived in Skerries but moved to England when Bracken was four.

He was brought up in Liverpool and was educated at St. Edward&#x27;s College, and later at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, where he was coached by former England Rugby Union Head Coach, Brian Ashton. He attended a trial for Liverpool FC and scored three goals. He also flirted with the idea of playing rugby league for St. Helens.

After school he studied law at the University of Bristol whom he represented at rugby union and later qualified as a solicitor. He was turned down by Ireland as &#x27;not good enough&#x27; but signed up by Bristol.

==Rugby career==
Bracken made his England debut in November 1993 against the All Blacks. However, a stamp from Jamie Joseph seriously injured his ankle, putting him out of action for three months and leaving him with a permanent weakness. He started the 1994 Five Nations, but was dropped halfway through in favour of Dewi Morris. He missed the summer tour to South Africa, studying for law exams, but played in the 1995 Five Nations. Injury kept him out of the 1995 World Cup.

Bracken joined Saracens in 1996 and was part of the team that won the Tetley&#x27;s Bitter Cup against Wasps in 1998.

He missed out on selection for the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa in favour of Matt Dawson and Austin Healey, but was called up as injury replacement for Rob Howley but did not play in the tests.

He then became an irregular scrum half for England, with Dawson generally having the upper hand but being frequently injured. Bracken himself had a serious back injury that kept him out for most of the 1999–2000 season, including the 1999 World Cup.

He missed out on selection for 2001 Lions tour to Australia, instead captaining England on a three match development tour of North America. By then he was mostly having to compete with Matt Dawson as first-choice scrum-half. In 2003 he played in the summer tour beating Australia and New Zealand. He appeared four times for England during the 2003 World Cup, mostly as a substitute or blood replacement, becoming a world-cup winner as England lifted the trophy. He won his 50th cap against Wales in the quarter-final, and gained his last cap in the semi-final against France.

Bracken was also the player who drew groans from the cast of &quot;Friends&quot; after being tackled in the episode &quot;The One with All the Rugby&quot;.

==&quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;==

Bracken starred in and won ITV&#x27;s celebrity ice dancing competition &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in 2007, with partner Melanie Lambert. In the semi-final he received the highest score in the history of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; at that time (29.5 out of a possible 30) matched only by rival Clare Buckfield the next week. He was then voted into the final alongside actress Clare Buckfield and former Blue member Duncan James.

He won the final on 17 March 2007 after a performance which included the required element of &quot;flying&quot; on wires and a final performance of Bolero.

On 24 March 2007 he won the special edition of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; &#x27;The Champion of Champions&#x27;, after repeating his record 29.5-point score.

He toured with &quot;Holiday on Ice&quot; in their show &quot;Romanza&quot;.

Bracken made an appearance during preparations for &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; 2008, week 5, to help contestant and friend Steve Backley with his performance.
After finishing the tour with &quot;Holiday on Ice&quot; Bracken has confirmed he was appearing in the &quot;Dancing on Ice Live&quot; tour 2008.

He also created his own Ice Party, held at the Hand Stadium, home of Clevedon Town, which starred himself, Clare Buckfield, Suzanne Shaw and many world-famous skaters.

Bracken placed 5th in the 2014 &#x27;all stars&#x27; series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; being eliminated in the Quarter-Finals. He was partnered with professional ice skater Nina Ulanova.

==Media career==
In 2020, Kyran launched a new podcast called Ruck It! with fellow England international Nick Easter.

==Personal life==
Bracken and his wife, Victoria, have three sons, Charlie, Jack and Lochlan, and they live in Hadley Wood.

==Charitable work==
Bracken is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland. He is also an Ambassador of the Royal National Children&#x27;s Foundation (formerly the Joint Educational trust) which helps support vulnerable, disadvantaged young people at state and independent boarding schools throughout the UK.

In 2009 he presented awards for Amersham &amp; Wycombe College in their first awards ceremony.

<text>Sesostris () is the name of a king of ancient Egypt who, according to Herodotus, led a military expedition into parts of Europe. Tales of Sesostris are probably based on the life of Senusret I, Senusret III and perhaps other Pharaohs such as Shoshenq I and Ramesses II.

Sesostris&#x27; name is also given as Sesoösis or Sesonchosis in other sources.

== Account of Herodotus ==
In Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; there appears a story told by Egyptian priests about a Pharaoh Sesostris, who once led an army northward overland to Asia Minor, then fought his way westward until he crossed into Europe, where he defeated the Scythians and Thracians (possibly in modern Romania and Bulgaria). Sesostris then returned home, leaving colonists behind at the river Phasis in Colchis. Herodotus cautioned the reader that much of this story came second hand via Egyptian priests, but also noted that the Colchians were commonly believed to be Egyptian colonists.

Herodotus also relates that when Sesostris defeated an army without much resistance he erected a pillar in their capital with a vulva on it to symbolize the fact that the army fought like women. Pliny the Elder also makes mention of Sesostris, who, he claims, was defeated by Saulaces, a gold-rich king of Colchis.

Herodotus describes Sesostris as the father of the blind king Pheron, who was less warlike than his father.

According to Professor Alan Lloyd &#x27;The core of Herodotus’ narrative is provided by an Egyptian tradition which presented Sesostris as a model of the ideal of kingship. This certainly contained an historical element, but it has been supplemented and contaminated by folklore, nationalist propaganda, and Greek attitudes.&quot;

==Diodorus Siculus==
According to Diodorus Siculus (who calls him &quot;Sesoosis&quot;) and Strabo, he conquered the whole world, even Scythia and Aethiopia, divided Egypt into administrative districts or &quot;nomes&quot;, was a great law-giver, and introduced a caste system into Egypt and the worship of Serapis. Diodorus also wrote that &quot;with regard to this king not only are the Greek writers at variance with one another, but also among the Egyptians the priests and the poets who sing his praises give conflicting stories” (1.53).

==Modern research==
In Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (History of Egypt), a pharaoh called &quot;Sesostris&quot; occupied the same position as the known pharaoh Senusret III of the Twelfth Dynasty, and his name is now usually viewed as a corruption of Senusret/Senwosret/Senwosri. In fact, he is commonly believed to be based on Senusret III, with the possible addition of memories of other namesake pharaohs of the same dynasty, as well as Seti I and Ramesses II of the much later Nineteenth Dynasty.

The images of Sesostris carved in stone in Ionia which Herodotus said he had seen are likely to be identified with the Luwian inscriptions of Karabel Pass, the Karabel relief, now known to have been carved by Tarkasnawa, king of the Arzawan rump state of Mira. The kings of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties were possibly the greatest conquerors that Egypt ever produced, and their records are much clearer than the older dynasties on the limits of Egyptian expansion. Senusret III raided into the Levant as far as Shechem, also into Aethiopia, and at Semna above the second cataract set up a stela of conquest that in its expressions recalls the stelae of Sesostris in Herodotus: Sesostris may, therefore, be the highly magnified portrait of this Pharaoh.

Sesostris is also mentioned in the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; where Alexander is described as &quot;the new Sesostris, ruler of the world.

<text>The Wichita people, or Kitikiti&#x27;sh, are a confederation of Southern Plains Native American tribes. Historically they spoke the Wichita language and Kichai language, both Caddoan languages. They are indigenous to Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas.

Today, Wichita tribes, which include the Kichai people, Waco, Taovaya, Tawakoni, and the Wichita proper (or Guichita), are federally recognized as the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (Wichita, Keechi, Waco and Tawakoni).

==Government==

The Wichita and Affiliated Tribes are headquartered in Anadarko, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area is in Caddo County, Oklahoma. The Wichitas are a self-governance tribe, who operate their own housing authority and issue tribal vehicle tags.

The current tribal administration is as follows.
* President: Terri Parton
* Vice-President: Jarrod Prince
* Secretary: Myles Stephenson Jr.
* Treasurer: Claudia Spybuck

==Economic development==
The tribe owns the Sugar Creek Casino, several restaurants, the Sugar Creek Event Center, and Hinton Travel Inn in Hinton. It owns a smoke shop, travel plaza, and historical center in Anadarko. Their annual economic impact in 2010 was $4.5 million.

== Culture ==

The Wichita language is one of the Caddoan languages. They are related by language and culture to the Pawnee, with whom they have close relations.

The Wichita lived in settled villages with domed-shaped, grass lodges, sometimes up to in diameter. The Wichita were successful hunters, farmers, traders, and negotiators. Their historical homelands stretched from San Antonio, Texas, in the south to Great Bend, Kansas, in the north. A semi-sedentary people, they occupied northern Texas in the early 18th century. They traded with other Southern Plains Indians on both sides of the Red River and south to Waco.

The Wichita made much of their own art, including ceramic pottery that greatly fascinated French and Spanish traders. To the untrained eye Wichita pottery was &quot;virtually indistinguishable from the Osage and Pawnee&quot;, two other neighboring Indigenous groups.

Historically, for much of the year, the Wichita lived in huts made of forked cedar poles covered by dry grasses. In the winter, they followed American bison (buffalo) in a seasonal hunt and lived in hunting camps. Wichita people relied heavily on bison, using all parts—for clothing, food and cooking fat, winter shelter, leather supplies, sinew, medicine, and even armor. Each spring, Wichita families settled in their villages for another season of cultivating crops. Eventually, horses played a large role in the Wichita people&#x27;s lifestyle. Increased access to horses in the mid 17th century caused Wichita hunting styles and seasons to become longer and more community-oriented. The Wichita economy also focused on horticulture, root-gathering, and fruits and nuts.

Wichita people wore clothing from tanned hides, which the women prepared and sewed. They often decorated their dresses with elk canine teeth. Both men and women tattooed their faces and bodies with solid and dotted lines and circles.

Wichita people had a history of intermarriage and alliance with other groups. Notably, the women of the Wichita worked with the Pueblo to harvest crops and engage in trade. Pueblo women were recorded to have intermarried with Wichita people and lived together in Wichita villages.

The social structure was organized by ranking of each tribe. Tribes were also led by two chiefs.

=== Names ===
The Wichita tribes call themselves Kitikiti&#x27;sh or Kirikirish (&quot;raccoon-eyed people&quot;), because of the historical practice of tattooing marks around their eyes. The kindred Pawnee called them Kírikuuruks or Kírikuruks (&quot;bear-eyed people&quot;) and the Arikara referred to them as Čirikuúnux (a reference to the Wichita practice of tattoos). The Kiowa called them Thoe-Khoot (&quot;tattoo faces&quot;).

=== Bands ===
Wichita people have been a loose confederation of related peoples on the Southern Plains, including such bands or sub-tribes as Taovayas (Tawehash), Tawakonis, Wacos (who appear to have been the Yscani or Iscanis of earlier times), and Guichitas or Wichita Proper; smaller bands are listed as well: Akwits (also Akwesh, Asidahetsh, or Asidahesh, a former northern Pawnee splinter group, which joined the Wichita), Itaz, Kishkat, and Korishkitsu (the two latter names may be a Wichita name for the Kichai). The Taovaya were the most important in the 18th century. The French called the Wichita peoples Panis Piqués (Pawnee Picts) or Panis Noirs (Black Pawnees), because they practiced tattooing; sometimes the Panis Piqués or Panis Noirs are included into the listing of Wichita sub-tribes, but it seems that there were no known separate sub-tribe which can be identified by this name. One Pawnee splinter grouping known as Panismahas moved from what is now Nebraska to the Texas-Arkansas border regions where they lived with the Taovayas.

=== Language ===
The Wichita people had a unified language system with minor dialectical differences based on the geography of unique tribes. Derived from the Caddoan language, much of the Wichita language was indistinguishable between tribes they shared close alliances with.

=== Cultural institutions ===
In 2018, the Wichita Tribes opened the Wichita Tribal History Center in Anadarko, which shares Wichita history, archaeology, visual arts, and culture with the public.

The Wichita Annual Dance, a powwow, is held at the Wichita Tribal Park on US-281, north of Anadarko, every August.

===Historical sites===
Several sites spanning across different time periods are spread around the United States. These sites are terraced around the Red River in Oklahoma and Texas, and they contain artifacts such as pottery, arrows, knives, clay figurines, and European trade goods. Extensive excavation of these sites revealed large ritualistic and burial structures common in the territory and culture of the Wichita people.

== History ==
=== Precontact history ===

The Ancestral Wichita people lived in the eastern Great Plains from the Red River in Arkansas north to Nebraska for at least 2,000 years. Early Wichita people were hunters and gatherers who gradually adopted agriculture. Farming villages were developed about 900 CE on terraces above the Washita and South Canadian Rivers in present-day Oklahoma. The women of these 10th-century communities cultivated varieties of maize, beans, and squash (known as the Three Sisters), marsh elder (&quot;Iva annua&quot;), and tobacco, which was important for religious purposes. The men hunted deer, rabbits, turkey, and, primarily, bison, and caught fish and harvested mussels from the rivers. These villagers lived in rectangular, thatched-roof houses.

Archaeologists describe the Washita River Phase from 1250 to 1450, when local populations grew and villages of up to 20 houses were spaced every two or so miles along the rivers. These farmers may have had contact with the Panhandle culture villages in the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles, farming villages along the Canadian River. The Panhandle villagers showed signs of adopting cultural characteristics of the Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande Valley, with whom they interacted.
In the late 15th century, most of these Washita River villages were abandoned for reasons that are not known today.

==== Great Bend settlements and council circles ====
Numerous archaeological sites in central Kansas near the Great Bend of the Arkansas River share common traits and are collectively known as the &quot;Great Bend aspect.&quot; Radiocarbon dates from these sites range from AD 1450 to 1700. Great Bend aspect sites are generally accepted as ancestral to the Wichita peoples described by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado and other early European explorers. The discovery of limited quantities of European artifacts, such as chain mail and iron axe heads at several Great Bend sites, suggests contact of these people with early Spanish explorers.

Great Bend aspect peoples&#x27; subsistence economy included agriculture, hunting, gathering, and fishing. Villages were located on the upper terraces of rivers, and crops appear to have been grown on the fertile floodplains below. Primary crops were maize, beans, squash, and sunflowers, cultivated for their seeds. Gathered foods included walnut and hickory nuts, and the fruits of plum, hackberry, and grape. Remains of animal bones in Great Aspect sites include bison, elk, deer, pronghorn, and dog, one of the few domesticated animals in the pre-Contact Plains.

Several village sites contain the remains of unusual structures called &quot;council circles,&quot; located at the center of settlements. Archaeological excavations suggest they consist of a central patio surrounded by four semi-subterranean structures. The function of the council circles is unclear. Archaeologist Waldo Wedel suggested in 1967 that they may be ceremonial structures, possibly associated with solstice observations. Recent analysis suggests that many non-local artifacts occur exclusively or primarily within council circles, implying the structures were occupied by political and/or ritual leaders of the Great Bend aspect peoples. Other archaeologists leave open the possibility that the council circle earthworks served a defensive role.

One of these sites was the city Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kansas, near the Arkansas River, that flourished between 1450 and 1700.

=== Post-contact history ===

In 1541 Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado journeyed east from the Rio Grande Valley in search of a rich land called Quivira. In Texas, probably in the Blanco River Canyon near Lubbock, Coronado met people he called Teyas who might have been related to the Wichita and the earlier Plains villagers. The Teyas, if in fact they were Wichita, were probably the ancestors of the Iscani and Waco, although they might also have been the Kichai, who spoke a different language but later joined the Wichita tribe. Turning north, he found Quivira and the people later known as the Wichita near the town of Lyons, Kansas. He was disappointed in his search for gold as the Quivirans appear to have been prosperous farmers and good hunters but had no gold or silver. There were about 25 villages of up to 200 houses each in Quivira. Coronado said: &quot;They were large people of very good build&quot;, and he was impressed with the land, which was &quot;fat and black.&quot; Though Coronado was impressed with Wichita society, he often treated the Wichita poorly in his expedition. Even after Wichita migration, some settlements were thought to have remained in northern Quivira in 1680.

It was also noted: &quot;They eat meat raw/jerky like the Querechos [the Apache] and Teyas. They are enemies of one another...These people of Quivira have the advantage over the others in their houses and in growing of maize&quot;.
The Quivirans apparently called their land Tancoa (which bears a resemblance to the later sub-tribe called Tawakoni) and a neighboring province on the Smoky Hill River was called Tabas (which bears a resemblance to the sub-tribe of Taovayas). Settlements existed here until the Wichita were driven away in the 18th century.

Sixty years after Coronado&#x27;s expedition the founder of New Mexico Juan de Oñate visited Etzanoa, the Wichita city. Oñate journeyed east from New Mexico, crossing the Great Plains and encountering two large settlements of people he called Escanjaques (possibly Yscani) and Rayados, most certainly Wichita. The Rayado city was probably on the Walnut River near Arkansas City, Kansas. Oñate described the city as containing &quot;more than twelve hundred houses&quot; which would indicate a population of about 12,000. His description of the Etzanoa was similar to that of Coronado&#x27;s description of Quivira. The homesteads were dispersed; the houses round, thatched with grass and surrounded by large granaries to store the corn, beans, and squash they grew in their fields. Oñate&#x27;s Rayados were certainly Wichita, probably the sub-tribe later known as the Guichitas.

What the Coronado and Oñate expeditions showed was that the Wichita people of the 16th century were numerous and widespread. They were not, however, a single tribe at this time but rather a group of several related tribes speaking a common language. The dispersed nature of their villages probably indicated that they were not seriously threatened by attack by enemies, although that would change as they would soon be squeezed between the Apache on the West and the powerful Osage on the East. European diseases would also probably be responsible for a large decline in the Wichita population in the 17th century.

In 1719, French explorers visited two groups of Wichita. Bernard de la Harpe found a large village near present-day Tulsa, Oklahoma and Claude Charles Du Tisne found two villages near Neodesha, Kansas. Regarding religion, La Harpe noticed that the Wichita people &quot;had little of it&quot;. He did, however, gain knowledge on the presence of a Great Spirit that the Wichita worshipped. Coronado&#x27;s Quivira was abandoned early in the 18th century, probably due to Apache attacks. The Rayados of Oñate were probably still living in about the same Walnut River location. Archaeologists have located a Wichita village at the Deer Creek Site dating from the 1750s on the Arkansas River east of Newkirk, Oklahoma. By 1757, however, it appears that all the Wichita had migrated south to the Red River.

The most prominent of the Wichita sub-tribes were the Taovayas. In the 1720s they had moved south from Kansas to the Red River establishing a large village on the north side of the River at Petersburg, Oklahoma and on the south side at Spanish Fort, Texas. They adopted many traits of the nomadic Plains Indians and were noted for raiding, trading. They had a close alliance with the French, and in 1746 a French brokered alliance with the Comanche revived the fortunes of the Wichita. The village at Petersburg was &quot;a lively emporium where Comanches brought Apache slaves, horses and mules to trade for French packs of powder, balls, knives, and textiles and for Taovaya-grown maize, melons, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco.&quot;

The Wichita and their Comanche allies were known to the Spanish as the &quot;&quot; (Northerners). The Wichita people and the Comanche attacked a Spanish military expedition in 1759. Afterwards, in response to the destruction by the of the San Saba Mission the Spanish and their Apache allies undertook an expedition to punish the Indians. Their 500-man army attacked the twin villages on Red River, but was defeated by the Wichita and Comanche in the Battle of the Twin Villages. The Spanish army suffered 19 dead and 14 wounded, leaving two cannons on the battlefield, although they claimed to have killed more than 100 Indians. 

The alliance between the Wichita, especially the Taovayas, and the Comanche began to break up in the 1770s as the Wichita sought a better relationship with the Spanish. Taovaya power in Texas declined sharply after an epidemic, probably smallpox, in 1777 and 1778 killed about one-third of the tribe. After the United States took over their territory as a result of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the independence of Texas in 1836, all the related tribes were increasingly lumped together and dubbed &quot;Wichita&quot;. That designation also included the Kichai of northern Texas, who spoke a different although a related language.

The principal village of the Wichita in the 1830s was near the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma although the Tawakoni and Wacos still lived in Texas and were moved onto a reservation on the upper Brazos River. They were forced out of Texas to a reservation in Oklahoma in 1859. During the Civil War, the Wichita allied with the Union side. They moved to Kansas, where they established a village at the site of present-day Wichita, Kansas. In 1867 they were relocated to a reservation in southwest Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in the area where most of them continue to reside today. On June 4, 1891, the affiliated tribes signed an agreement with the Cherokee Commission for individual allotments.

===Relationships with other indigenous tribes===
Wichita relationships were mostly harmonious and cooperative. The Wichita were allies with the Comanche and traded with them. However, they were enemies with groups such as the Pawnee, the Missouri, and the Apache. The Apache were the Wichita&#x27;s worst enemies, having driven them out of their homes before contact with Europeans.

The Wichita people&#x27;s relationship with the Osage is ambiguous. It is said to have been &quot;cautiously hostile&quot;, but many Osage groups attacked them in the 18th century, eventually driving them out of the Arkansas River Basin.

===Trade===
Due to geographical isolation, it was difficult for the French and Spanish to trade with the Wichita. The French traded with the Wichita primarily for their horses during the 16th century. The Wichita sensed that trading with the French would be ideal. Their migration in 1714 was partly motivated by their desire to move closer to European traders.

The Wichita first gained their European commodities in the mid 18th century, inspiring them to maintain close ties with the French in the 19th century. French traders were eager to exchange their goods with Wichita settlements as they traveled from Louisiana to Santa Fe.

== Population ==
The Wichita had a large population in the time of Coronado and Oñate. One scholar estimates their numbers at 200,000. Villages often contained around 1,000 to 1,250 people per village. Certainly they numbered in the tens of thousands. They appeared to be much reduced by the time of the first French contacts with them in 1719, probably due in large part to epidemics of infectious disease to which they had no immunity. In 1790, it was estimated there were about 3,200 total Wichita. Conflict with Texans in the early 19th century and Americans in the mid 19th century led to a major decline in population, leading to the eventual merging of Wichita settlements. By 1868, the population was recorded as being 572 total Wichita. By the time of the census of 1937, there were only 100 Wichita officially left.

In 2018, 2,953 people were enrolled in the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. In 2011, there were 2,501 enrolled Wichitas, 1,884 of whom lived in the state of Oklahoma. Enrollment in the tribe required a minimum blood quantum of 1/32, as of 2017.

<text>William Basil McIvor OBE, PC (NI) (17 June 1928 – 5 November 2004) was an Ulster Unionist politician, a minister in Northern Ireland&#x27;s first power-sharing Executive, a barrister and a pioneer of integrated education.

==Early life and education==

The son of Rev. Frederick McIvor, a Methodist clergyman, McIvor was born in Tullyhommon, the County Fermanagh part of the village of Pettigo, the rest of which is in County Donegal, the village straddling the Northern Ireland border. McIvor attended Methodist College, Belfast, and the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast and was called to the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1950. In his career at the Bar, Basil McIvor became Junior Crown Counsel and a Resident Magistrate in the 1970s.

==Political career==

He was elected to the Northern Ireland Parliament as Ulster Unionist Party MP for Larkfield in the 1969 election. He was one of a group of MPs who supported the beleaguered Prime Minister, Terence O&#x27;Neill. Viewed as a liberal he was given the job of Minister for Community Relations  by Brian Faulkner in 1971 and resigned from the Orange Order.

McIvor was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973, topping the poll in Belfast South, and a member of the Ulster Unionist contingent who negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement in 1973. When the power-sharing Executive was set up in the aftermath of Sunningdale, McIvor headed the Education Department in the new power-sharing executive, over which Faulkner presided as First Minister. 

As Minister of Education, McIvor advanced plans for what has since become known as integrated education. He proposed that, in addition to the existing (Catholic) Maintained Schools and the (non-Catholic) Controlled Schools, there should be &quot;shared schools&quot;, &quot;available to Catholic and Protestant parents alike who wished to have their children educated together&quot;. Disregarding a message from Cardinal William Conway &quot;not to interfere with the schools&quot;, McIvor, with Faulkner&#x27;s support brought the proposal to the Executive where he recalls it being welcomed by all, save Hume. Hume was &quot;less than enthusiastic&quot;.

The executive lasted but five months, brought down in May 1974 by the Ulster Workers Council strike. McIvor believed that much of the responsibility lay with the determination of the Unionists&#x27; Social Democratic and Labour Party partners to &quot;achieve all-Ireland institutions that would produce the dynamic that could lead ultimately to an agreed single state of Ireland&quot;. The insistence of their deputy leader John Hume on a cross-border Council of Ireland, in particular, blew &quot;out the light at the end of the tunnel&quot;. For the survival power sharing Hume&#x27;s &quot;grim and unbending&quot; approach was a &quot;disaster&quot;. (After the 1998 Belfast Agreement, McIvor did allow that Hume had &quot;courageously done much to promote peace in Northern Ireland within the context of his nationalist aspirations, and [had] been a force in compelling Unionists, and rightly so, to engage in dialogue with their arch enemy, Sinn Féin). 

After the fall of the executive, The McIvor left politics and sat as a resident magistrate.

In 1987, he was subject of a motion tabled in the United Kingdom House of Commons by four UUP MPs who accused him of showing bias against unionists and members of the Orange Order in a County Antrim case and so demanded McIvor&#x27;s removal from the bench.

==Investigations==

McIvor presided over the initial investigation into UVF supergrass William &#x27;Budgie&#x27; Allen and that of several people accused of killing two corporals in Belfast.

==Campaigning==

In 1981, McIvor became the first chairman of Lagan College, Northern Ireland&#x27;s first integrated secondary school. When Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness became education minister he invited him to visit the college. He was also a governor of Campbell College, Belfast from 1975 until his death.

Basil McIvor died on 5 November 2004 aged 76 while playing golf at Royal County Down.

==Family==

His son Jonathan McIvor was a senior police officer in both the Metropolitan Police Service and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) as well as providing law enforcement advice to the European Union Police Mission for the Palestinian Territories

As a Chief Inspector in the Metropolitan Police Service, he was criticised by the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry for his failure to manage the initial investigation of the scene of the murder of Stephen Lawrence.

Basil McIvor was appointed an OBE in the 1991 New Year Honours.

<doc id="1138941" wikidata="Q2755353" url="?curid=1138941" title="List of parties to the Kyoto Protocol">
<text>As of June 2013, there are 192 parties to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which aims to combat global warming. This total includes 191 states (189 United Nations member states as well as the Cook Islands and Niue) and one supranational union (the European Union). Canada renounced the protocol effective 15 December 2012 and ceased to be a member from that date.

With the Protocol&#x27;s 2008-2012 commitment period expiring, the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was agreed to, which establishes new commitments for the period 2013–2020. As of October 2020, 147 states have accepted this amendment.

==Parties==
Signing is optional, indicating an intention to ratify the Protocol. Ratification means that a state is legally bound by the provisions of the treaty. For Annex I parties (e.g. a developed state or one with an &#x27;economy in transition&#x27;) this means that it has agreed to cap emissions in accordance with the Protocol.

Iceland was the 55th state to ratify, fulfilling the first condition for coming-into-force. With Russia&#x27;s ratification the &quot;55 percent of 1990 carbon dioxide emissions of the Parties included in Annex I&quot; clause was satisfied and the treaty was brought into force, effective 16 February 2005. As of October 2020, 147 states have accepted the Doha amendment. It will enter into force as of 31 December 2020.

== Former parties ==
==Signatory==
==Not signatories or parties==
As of 2022 there are four UN member states or observers which are not party to the protocol, all of which are members of the UNFCCC: Andorra, Holy See, Palestine, South Sudan.

<doc id="1138942" wikidata="Q899720" url="?curid=1138942" title="Point group">
<text>In geometry, a point group is a mathematical group of symmetry operations (isometries in a Euclidean space) that have a fixed point in common. The coordinate origin of the Euclidean space is conventionally taken to be a fixed point, and every point group in dimension &quot;d&quot; is then a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(&quot;d&quot;). Point groups are used to describe the symmetries of geometric figures and physical objects such as molecules.

Each point group can be represented as sets of orthogonal matrices &quot;M&quot; that transform point &quot;x&quot; into point &quot;y&quot; according to . Each element of a point group is either a rotation (determinant of ), or it is a reflection or improper rotation (determinant of ).

The geometric symmetries of crystals are described by space groups, which allow translations and contain point groups as subgroups. Discrete point groups in more than one dimension come in infinite families, but from the crystallographic restriction theorem and one of Bieberbach&#x27;s theorems, each number of dimensions has only a finite number of point groups that are symmetric over some lattice or grid with that number of dimensions. These are the crystallographic point groups.

== Chiral and achiral point groups, reflection groups ==
Point groups can be classified into &quot;chiral&quot; (or purely rotational) groups and &quot;achiral&quot; groups.
The chiral groups are subgroups of the special orthogonal group SO(&quot;d&quot;): they contain only orientation-preserving orthogonal transformations, i.e., those of determinant +1. The achiral groups contain also transformations of determinant −1. In an achiral group, the orientation-preserving transformations form a (chiral) subgroup of index 2.

Finite Coxeter groups or &quot;reflection groups&quot; are those point groups that are generated purely by a set of reflectional mirrors passing through the same point. A rank &quot;n&quot; Coxeter group has &quot;n&quot; mirrors and is represented by a Coxeter–Dynkin diagram. Coxeter notation offers a bracketed notation equivalent to the Coxeter diagram, with markup symbols for rotational and other subsymmetry point groups. Reflection groups are necessarily achiral (except for the trivial group containing only the identity element).

== List of point groups ==

=== One dimension ===
There are only two one-dimensional point groups, the identity group and the reflection group.

=== Two dimensions ===
Point groups in two dimensions, sometimes called rosette groups.

They come in two infinite families:
# Cyclic groups C&quot;n&quot; of &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation groups
# Dihedral groups D&quot;n&quot; of &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation and reflection groups
Applying the crystallographic restriction theorem restricts &quot;n&quot; to values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 for both families, yielding 10 groups.

The subset of pure reflectional point groups, defined by 1 or 2 mirrors, can also be given by their Coxeter group and related polygons. These include 5 crystallographic groups. The symmetry of the reflectional groups can be doubled by an isomorphism, mapping both mirrors onto each other by a bisecting mirror, doubling the symmetry order.

=== Three dimensions ===
Point groups in three dimensions, sometimes called molecular point groups after their wide use in studying symmetries of molecules.

They come in 7 infinite families of axial groups (also called prismatic), and 7 additional polyhedral groups (also called Platonic). In Schönflies notation,
* Axial groups: C&quot;n&quot;, S2&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;h, C&quot;n&quot;v, D&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;d, D&quot;n&quot;h
* Polyhedral groups: T, Td, Th, O, Oh, I, Ih
Applying the crystallographic restriction theorem to these groups yields the 32 crystallographic point groups.

==== Reflection groups ====

The reflection point groups, defined by 1 to 3 mirror planes, can also be given by their Coxeter group and related polyhedra. The [3,3] group can be doubled, written as , mapping the first and last mirrors onto each other, doubling the symmetry to 48, and isomorphic to the [4,3] group.
=== Four dimensions ===
The four-dimensional point groups (chiral as well as achiral) are listed in Conway and Smith, Section 4, Tables 4.1–4.3.
The following list gives the four-dimensional reflection groups (excluding those that leave a subspace fixed and that are therefore lower-dimensional reflection groups). Each group is specified as a Coxeter group, and like the polyhedral groups of 3D, it can be named by its related convex regular 4-polytope. Related pure rotational groups exist for each with half the order, and can be represented by the bracket Coxeter notation with a &#x27;+&#x27; exponent, for example [3,3,3]+ has three 3-fold gyration points and symmetry order 60. Front-back symmetric groups like [3,3,3] and [3,4,3] can be doubled, shown as double brackets in Coxeter&#x27;s notation, for example with its order doubled to 240.

=== Five dimensions ===

The following table gives the five-dimensional reflection groups (excluding those that are lower-dimensional reflection groups), by listing them as Coxeter groups. Related chiral groups exist for each with half the order, and can be represented by the bracket Coxeter notation with a &#x27;+&#x27; exponent, for example [3,3,3,3]+ has four 3-fold gyration points and symmetry order 360.

=== Six dimensions ===

The following table gives the six-dimensional reflection groups (excluding those that are lower-dimensional reflection groups), by listing them as Coxeter groups. Related pure rotational groups exist for each with half the order, and can be represented by the bracket Coxeter notation with a &#x27;+&#x27; exponent, for example [3,3,3,3,3]+ has five 3-fold gyration points and symmetry order 2520.

=== Seven dimensions ===
The following table gives the seven-dimensional reflection groups (excluding those that are lower-dimensional reflection groups), by listing them as Coxeter groups. Related chiral groups exist for each with half the order, defined by an even number of reflections, and can be represented by the bracket Coxeter notation with a &#x27;+&#x27; exponent, for example [3,3,3,3,3,3]+ has six 3-fold gyration points and symmetry order 20160.

=== Eight dimensions ===
The following table gives the eight-dimensional reflection groups (excluding those that are lower-dimensional reflection groups), by listing them as Coxeter groups. Related chiral groups exist for each with half the order, defined by an even number of reflections, and can be represented by the bracket Coxeter notation with a &#x27;+&#x27; exponent, for example [3,3,3,3,3,3,3]+ has seven 3-fold gyration points and symmetry order 181440.

<text>Mount Hopkins is a mountain in the John Muir Wilderness north of Kings Canyon National Park. It is one of four peaks that surround Pioneer Basin, south-southeast of Mount Crocker, west-southwest of Mount Huntington, and southwest of Mount Stanford. The mountain was named for Mark Hopkins, one of the builders of the Central Pacific Railroad.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Mount Hopkins is located in an alpine climate zone. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks (orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range.

<text>is a Japanese action manga series written by Izo Hashimoto and illustrated by Akio Tanaka. It was first serialized in Futabasha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; in 1998 and moved to &quot;Evening&quot; in 2004. It was discontinued in 2007 due to creative differences but returned in 2011 and ended in 2015. It tells a story of a boy who killed his parents and turned himself into a cold-blooded martial artist. The manga inspired a Hong Kong film adaptation that was released in 2007.

==Synopsis==

===Part 1: The Reformatory===
, a talented highschooler who was about to enter Tokyo University, the most prestigious university in Japan, killed his parents before his successful life could begin. The perfect family and perfect life seemed to devour the young boy&#x27;s restless soul. In a beautiful sunny afternoon when cicadas were singing, he stabbed his father and mother to death with a short knife repeatedly before he came to his senses.

The 16-year-old bookworm murderer was convicted and sent to a reformatory where he was gang raped by other boys. , a jailed man who nearly assassinated the Japanese Prime Minister decades ago, was sent to the reformatory to teach the youngsters karate every week. He discovered Ryo&#x27;s talent and taught him self-defense. Ryo survived and thanks to a law that protects minors, was released two years later, but not before beating several would-be attackers with such savagery that his previous tormentors became terrified of him. He also engaged Kurokawa in a sparring match as a final test of his skills. Ryo returns to society with the mindset of gaining strength so as to survive and never be a victim again.

Alone in a city full of crime, he tried to look for his lost sister but ends up mistaking a drug-abusing prostitute for her. Ryo started to fight for his living and used all imaginable dirty tricks to defeat his enemies. He also ambushed gangsters in dark alleys to perfect his fighting skill as well as working as a gigolo. He later enters into a Banryukai karate tournament and spends time training his reflexes by kidnapping a woman and forcing her to attempt to kill him, releasing her after he successfully sensed her killing intent. He wins the tournament by blackmailing his opponents anonymously and throwing them off their game with his knowledge of their dirtiest secrets (e.g. an opponent whose wife is openly unfaithful). He wins in his weight class despite objections from the crowd and his fellow contestants over his vicious fighting style, but his victory is legitimized by Mochizuki himself, who claims that Ryo&#x27;s fighting is still superior regardless of the context.

===Part 2: Sugawara===
In this part, Ryo fights of the twice. Kurokawa, a castaway from that elite dojo, helps Ryo to become stronger as a way to get revenge on , his past foe and the current owner of the Banryukai. Banryukai is possibly modeled after the Kyokushin kaikan and Seidokaikan and Mochizuki is possibly modeled after Kazuyoshi Ishii, the founder of Seidokaikan.

Believing that he is the strongest, the &quot;gamecock&quot; starts to take on other good martial artists. A blood-thirsty TV producer notices that this street-fighting young man was the &quot;Youth A&quot; and pushes to have him join &quot;Lethal Fight,&quot; a fictional combat arena modeled after Japan&#x27;s K-1 tournament. Ryo, a dangerous man with an animal instinct who destroyed many good fighters in the ring, one day finds himself facing Thailand&#x27;s best fighter who was fighting to support his family. Before he is totally defeated, he tries to kick the Thai fighter&#x27;s neck but the fighter ducks and is hit in the eye and blinded.

Ryo wants to take on Sugawara. However, Sugawara is much taller and heavier than Ryo, so his chance to fight him was remote. As a way to provide incentive, Ryo raped Sugawara&#x27;s supermodel girlfriend. Sugawara vowed to kill Ryo with his hands in the boxing ring to comfort his woman and agreed to a televised fight at the Tokyo Dome. It was the duel between darkness and brightness. Only this time, Ryo (亮), literally &quot;brightness,&quot; stands for the dark side.

Ryo goes through a painful bodybuilding regime where he used steroids to increase his muscle mass and strength. Before the fight began, his left eye became bloody under the non-human torture. He did not care. Bad luck was on Ryo&#x27;s side. His small body still was no comparison to Sugawara&#x27;s. However, he rediscovered his long-forgotten left-handedness suppressed by his parents since he was a child minutes before the end of the last round. Then he wildly gave Sugawara countless heavy left punches before Sugawara used his broken right fist to punch him out of consciousness. He survives the lethal fight and was defeated only five seconds before the fight was over. Sugawara fails to kill him in front of the crowd.

Out of anger and frustration, Sugawara invites Ryo to another private fight three months later in an abandoned temple. Sugawara takes several darts and a long wooden stick. Ryo takes a pair of tonfa with him. After a long and brutal duel where Narushima is almost killed, Sugawara is hit in the back of the neck and was hospitalized.

===Part 3: The Ballet Dancer===
It tells a story that Toma Takahara (高原 東馬 &quot;Takahara Tōma&quot;), a successful male ballet dancer with a savior complex, mysteriously abandoned his dancing career to pursue martial arts. It is revealed that the reason is because, after witnessing Ryo&#x27;s fight with Sugawara, he became obsessed with Ryo and desired to &#x27;save&#x27; him like he has others before. The new volumes (20, 21) pick up with Ryo fighting in a club in Japan. Ryo discovers after one fight that his ability has dropped significantly (implied to be due to the experimental steroids he had taken before) and he decides to start training hard. Ryo enters a Banryukai karate competition in a mask and after losing in the finals by disqualification, is spotted by Mochizuki. Mochizuki offers him money to enter a grappling tournament fighting against Toma. Ryo, desperate for money, accepts and begins training with the master of the man he lost to in the finals (who has since returned to being a hikkikomori). Before the tournament, he visits the comatose Sugawara in the hospital and, after Ryo emotionally implores his rival to wake up, Sugawara hears Ryo&#x27;s voice and comes out of his coma. Ryo is placed on Team Banryukai, made up of himself and the four Black Dogi (Banryukai masters wearing black gi) and Team Toma is made up of Toma and four masters of various styles ranging from well known to esoteric. Ryo also discovers that Kurokawa was the one who trained Toma, as he now desires to undo what he had done by turning Ryo down the path of violence. This revelation only spurs Ryo on, as he becomes determined to defeat his master, who was now a part of the same society he had taught Ryo to hate and war against. The first four fights end with two no-contests, two wins by team Toma and one win for the Banryukai. While waiting for his turn to fight, Ryo was stabbed by Moemi Funato. However, he still plans to fight.

Ryo and Toma start fighting with Toma at a heavy advantage. However, before he can win a sudden thunderstorm floods the stage. adapting more quickly to this new field Ryo turns the tables and begins using mind games to overwhelm the more naive Toma. Having so far fought calmly Toma becomes enraged and afraid further playing into Ryo&#x27;s hands. As Ryo begins to gain more and more of an advantage, he begins to realize that Toma isn&#x27;t actually a good person, but rather had just never encountered someone who was truly evil or in need of actual salvation. The damage from the stab wound was too much however and Toma manages to win thanks to Ryo fainting from blood loss, but he is mentally crippled by Ryo&#x27;s nightmarish fighting style and the hallucinations he had during the fight.

During the aftermath of the fight Mochizuki is replaced as chairman and the Banryukai is split into two factions (True and New Banryukai) and officially breaks all ties with Lethal Fight, pinning all of the more sordid things Banryukai members did under the label on Mochizuki. After a night of drinking Mochizuki is mugged and killed. Ryo finds out that Kurokawa and his ringside doctor have both died during the night. Ryo begins living with his sister and her caretaker.

===Part 4: 2 Foolish Brothers===
Ryo begins dating a girl. Her father doesn&#x27;t approve. He hires 2 hit men to deal with Ryo and get his daughter back despite the fact she is there of her own free will. After a confrontation at his house Ryo agrees to fight the younger brother. While Ryo wins he is mortally wounded and later dies from his wounds, in the forest. Rags of his crow shirt can be seen in the last pages, suggesting an alternative end.

==Film==
&quot;Shamo&quot; was made into a Hong Kong film in 2007. It was directed by Cheang Pou-soi and starred Shawn Yue.

==Court case==
The manga, written by Izo Hashimoto and illustrated by Akio Tanaka, was first serialized in 1998 in &quot;Manga Action&quot;. It moved to &quot;Evening&quot; and was put on hold in 2007 due in part to creative differences. &quot;Shamo&quot; manga artist Akio Tanaka was in a legal battle against Shamo&#x27;s credited creator, Izô Hashimoto, for 150 million yen (about US$1.4 million) in a copyright lawsuit that opened in June 2008 in the Tokyo District Court. Tanaka claimed that he, and not Hashimoto, had created the story and the character concepts. On July 18, 2011, Tanaka announced on his homepage that &quot;Shamo&quot; would return to the pages of &quot;Evening&quot; magazine on July 27, 2011, and the title would start to be reprinted in wide editions. The serialization of the series concluded on January 13, 2015.

<text>Mount Hopkins is a peak of the Santa Rita Mountains range, in Santa Cruz County, southern Arizona.

The peak was named after Gilbert Hopkins, who was killed nearby during the Battle of Fort Buchanan in 1865.

It is in the Coronado National Forest and is bounded on three sides by the Mount Wrightson Wilderness.

==Fairborn Observatory==
In 1979, Russell Merle Genet founded the Fairborn Observatory, which he moved from Fairborn, Ohio to Mount Hopkins, Arizona in 1985, and worked there until 1993. He was also its first director, until 1989. Genet and his colleagues developed robotic telescopes there. It became the first totally automatic robotic observatory in the world.

==Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory==
The Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory is located on the mountain. The prime mover for the mountain&#x27;s observatory was Fred Whipple, a professor at Harvard University who was in charge of a small 25 inch mirror telescope in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In Cambridge the ambient light caused light pollution that limited the telescope&#x27;s usefulness.

That led to engineer Tom Hoffman being appointed by Whipple to search for a site in the U.S. that would provide a clear view of the sky at a high elevation, with minimal surrounding light pollution. After searching many locations, southern Arizona with its dry air and high elevations, and the assistance of The University of Arizona, brought Hoffman to focus on Mt Hopkins. Whipple agreed, leaving the challenge of how to transport an diameter glass mirror and build a telescope on an mountain that had no road.

<doc id="1138962" wikidata="Q502292" url="?curid=1138962" title="Andrei Mureșanu">
<text>Andrei Mureșanu (; November 16, 1816 in Bistrița – October 12, 1863 in Brașov) was a Romanian poet and revolutionary of Transylvania.

Born in a family of a small business owner in the countryside, he studied philosophy and theology in Blaj. In 1838 he started working as a professor in Brașov. He published his first poetry in the magazine &quot;Foaie pentru minte, inimă și literatură&quot; (&quot;Paper for mind, heart and literature&quot;). He was one of the leading figures of the 1848 revolution in Transylvania, taking part in the Brașov delegation at the Blaj Assembly in May 1848. His poem &quot;Deșteaptă-te, române!&quot;, composition based on a popular tune of an old religious anthem, became the hymn of the revolutionaries. Nicolae Bălcescu named it &quot;&quot;La Marseillaise&quot; of Romanians&quot; for its ability to mobilize the people to fight. The poem later became the national anthem of Romania in 1990.

After the revolution, Mureșanu worked as a translator in Sibiu, had some patriotical works published in the &quot;Telegraful Român&quot; magazine. In 1862 his poetry was gathered in a single volume. Due to poor health conditions, he died in 1863 at Brașov. He is buried in the city’s Groaveri cemetery.

<text>Beijing Central Axis (), or Central Axis (), refers to a stretch of road in Beijing, China. Beijing Central Axis extends 7.8 kilometers from the Drum and Bell Towers in the north to the Yongdingmen Gate in the south.

Beijing Central Axis boasts both ceremonial and iconic buildings dating back to the 13th century (Yuan dynasty). These structures, with distinctive features, serve as exemplars of ancient Chinese architecture. When so many heritages come together, the complex becomes a story of Chinese civilization and the process of unity in Chinese history, as well as a concise overview of Chinese aesthetics.

<text>Ian Hornak (January 9, 1944 – December 9, 2002) was an American draughtsman, painter and printmaker. He was one of the founding artists of the Hyperrealist and Photorealist fine art movements; credited with having been the first Photorealist artist to incorporate the effect of multiple exposure photography into his landscape paintings; and the first contemporary artist to entirely expand the imagery of his primary paintings onto the frames.

== Early life and education ==

Ian Hornak was born on January 9, 1944, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Slovakian immigrants, Frank and Rose Hornak (née Vagich). Following Hornak’s birth, the family relocated to Brooklyn Heights, New York, where his mother owned a confectionery; and the family again relocated to Mount Clemens, Michigan, where they purchased a large working farm.

Hornak graduated from the New Haven High School in Michigan as a member of the National Honor Society; briefly attended University of Michigan–Dearborn; and transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in studio art in 1964; and Master of Fine Arts in studio art in 1966.

Between 1966 and 1968 he taught studio art courses at Henry Ford Community College, and Wayne State University.

== Career ==

While living in Detroit, Hornak was introduced to Lowell Nesbitt, then one of the most successful artists in New York City, by Detroit art dealer, Gertrude Kasle.

In the summer of 1968, Hornak sublet one of Nesbitt’s large studios on West 14th Street in the Meatpacking District, they developed a friendship, and Nesbitt in-turn introduced Hornak into the New York City art scene which included Nesbitt’s then milieu, later to become Hornak’s, artists Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Robert Motherwell, Robert Indiana, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Alex Katz.

Initially, Nesbitt introduced Hornak to Eleanor Ward, then Nesbitt’s dealer, and she included Hornak in group exhibitions at her Stable Gallery, then one of the most important galleries in New York City. Ward, however, announced that she intended to close her gallery in 1970 as she moved toward retirement.

Lee Krasner introduced Hornak in 1970 to Jackson Pollock’s nephew, Jason McCoy, who was then the assistant director of the Tibor de Nagy Gallery. On the strength of Krasner’s recommendation, McCoy and the owner of the gallery, Tibor de Nagy, agreed to sign Hornak to an exclusive contract and to host his first New York City solo exhibition in 1971.

Despite having had multiple critically acclaimed, sold-out exhibitions at Tibor de Nagy; in 1976, Hornak announced that he was moving his representation to the Fischbach Gallery where he remained until 1984.

In 1985, Jimmy Ernst, son of Max Ernst, and stepson of Peggy Guggenheim, recommended Hornak to the Armstrong Gallery in New York City where he had one solo exhibition.

Hornak transferred his representation to the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery in 1986 where he had nine critically and financially successful solo exhibitions and remained until his death in 2002.

== Work ==

At age nine, Hornak received a set of oil paints and a book of important Renaissance paintings from his mother as a gift. From the book he credibly interpreted the works of Michelangelo Buonarroti, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael Sanzio. During an interview with the &quot;57th Street Review&quot; in 1976, Hornak said, &quot;I picked up my technique as a child through my interest in art and copying paintings I liked. I especially loved Renaissance painting, because it had clarity and simplification of form and great organization&quot;.

Throughout his undergraduate and graduate studies, Hornak concentrated on painting in a realist technique that depicted the rural landscapes of his childhood; as well as erotic subjects that resulted from the then current exploration of his bisexuality. He also created a large body of prints with Renaissance, and Baroque inspired subject matter, mostly in the medium of etching.

In New York, Hornak was among the first artists to produce Photorealist artwork, along with his counterparts Richard Estes, Chuck Close, Malcom Morley, Lowell Nesbitt, and Howard Kanovitz as a reaction to the then dominant Pop Art movement.


In 1970, Hornak debuted the first landscape paintings of his multiple exposure series. He is credited as having been the first photorealist artist to incorporate the concept of multiple exposure photography into his paintings.

In 1985, Jimmy Ernst encouraged Hornak to create a new series of paintings, more expressionistic in technique. The result was a small series of paintings depicting apocalyptic landscapes.

From 1986 until his death in 2002 Hornak produced botanical and still life paintings inspired by the Dutch and Flemish masters from The Golden Age. During that series, Hornak was credited as being the first contemporary artist to fully expand the imagery of his primary canvas onto a frame. Hornak said, &quot;I begin with one flower, then add and subtract, balance and counterbalance. The finesse of the surface, the sensual appeal of the subject matter are there but the beauty lies deeper in the content. My flower pieces derive less from 19th century realists and/or impressionists, with their literal depiction of color, texture and form, and more from the 17th century Flemish painters whose flowers give visual pleasure, and imply a more generalized reality and symbolism&quot;.

Hornak said of his own artistic vision in an interview with Cover Magazine in 1994, &quot;While I know that the beautiful, the spiritual and the sublime are today suspect, I have begun to stop resisting the constant urge to deny that beauty has a valid right to exist in contemporary art&quot;.

== Homes and studios ==

Hornak owned a home and a large studio in East Hampton, New York which he used as his primary residence from 1970 until his death in 2002. He also had a secondary penthouse studio on New York City’s Upper East Side near the intersection of East 73rd Street and Park Avenue. Hornak spent the winters at a home and studio that he owned in Sarasota, Florida which he initially built to be near his friend, Jimmy Ernst who also had a home in the region.

==Influences==

Hornak often cited the Hudson River School artists as major influences, especially Martin Johnson Heade and Frederic Edwin Church in addition to Nineteenth-Century German Romantic Artist, Caspar David Friedrich. Additionally the artist commented on his influences, *&quot;What I so like about Poussin and Cézanne is their sense of organization. I like the way in which they develop space and shape in architectural continuity - the rhythm across their paintings. When I paint a landscape, I get the greatest pleasure out of composing it. As I paint, I try to work out a visual sonata form or a fugue, with realistic images&quot;.

==Critical response==

In response to Hornak’s multiple exposure landscape paintings, John Canaday wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1974, &quot;Mr. Hornak is right at the top of the list of romantically descriptive painters today&quot;.

As Hornak was nearing the end of the multiple exposure landscape series, Marcia Corbino wrote in the Sarasota Herald Tribune, &quot;Not since the Hudson River School glorified the grandiose panorama of the natural world in meticulous detail has an American artist embraced landscape painting with the artistic totality of Ian Hornak&quot;.

In ARTnews magazine, Gerrit Henry wrote about Hornak’s floral and still life paintings, &quot;Hornak is a rather self-explanatory if not wholly tautological postmodernism. Perhaps, though, his excesses ring true for the approaching millennium: this is &#x27;end-time&#x27; painting that exercises its romantic license to the fullest in its presentation of multiple styles of the last &quot;fin de siècle&quot; – naturalist, symbolist, allegorical, apocalyptic&quot;.

==Personal life and art collection==

Ian Hornak, had a younger sister, Rosemary Hornak who was also a fine artist, and the sole beneficiary of his estate; and younger brother, Michael Hornak. His nephew by his sister Rosemary, Eric Ian Spoutz was Hornak’s namesake, an art dealer, as well as having been Hornak’s studio manager and later his estate executor.

Hornak was openly bisexual, and his life partner from 1970 to 1976 was Julius Rosenthal Wolf, who was a prominent American casting director, producer, theatrical agent, art collector, art dealer, and the vice president of General Amusement Corporation, then the second largest talent management company in the world During the 1950s and 1960s, Wolf had been the assistant director of Edith Halpert&#x27;s Downtown Gallery in New York City where he became a champion of American Modernism in the visual arts. Together, Wolf and Hornak lived at their homes in New York City&#x27;s Upper East Side and at their weekend home in East Hampton, New York, where Hornak continued to live until his own death in 2002. Following Wolf&#x27;s death in 1976, Frank Burton was Hornak&#x27;s life partner until Burton&#x27;s death in 1996.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Wolf dedicated himself to the collection of American Modernist and African American art, which he had developed a professional knowledge of during his time as assistant director of The Downtown Gallery. Later Hornak introduced Wolf to the contemporary art scene in New York City and educated him on the current trends in visual culture. Together Wolf and Hornak assembled a large collection of artwork and upon Wolf&#x27;s death in 1976, per Wolf and Hornak&#x27;s wishes, John G. Heimann, Wolf&#x27;s estate executor, delivered a bequest of 95 artworks to the Hood Museum of Art and the Hopkins Center for the Arts at Wolf&#x27;s alma mater Dartmouth College. Among the artists whose original artworks are in the collection are David Burliuk, Willard Metcalf, Louis Eilshemius, Arthur Dove, John Marin, Philip Evergood, Marc Chagall, Ben Shahn, Pat Steir, José Luis Cuevas, Philomé Obin, Larry Rivers, Paul Jenkins, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Motherwell, Ellsworth Kelly, Leonard Baskin, Robert Indiana, Lee Bontecou, Ad Reinhardt, Jack Youngerman, Stuart Davis, Larry Poons, Lowell Nesbitt, Jacob Lawrence, Marisol, Joe Brainard and Fairfield Porter. The collection also houses a small collection of intimate paintings and drawings by Ian Hornak that Hornak gifted to Wolf including a large portrait of Wolf, titled &quot;Jay Wolf&quot; that Dartmouth College often uses to display Wolf&#x27;s likeness. The overall collection of artwork which has been dubbed &quot;The Jay Wolf Bequest of Contemporary Art&quot; by the college was exhibited at the Beaumont-May Gallery in The Hopkins Center, Dartmouth College, June 24 to August 28, 1977, and is recognized as the most significant bequest of artwork to Dartmouth College during the 1970s.

==Death and legacy==
Hornak had an aortic aneurysm on November 17, 2002, while painting in his studio in East Hampton, New York. Though he was rushed to the Southampton Hospital, and surgery was performed to repair the aorta, he died on December 9, 2002, as a result of complications. He was 58 years old.

On January 21, 2011, Hornak was interred in the Columbarium of Piety in the Iris Terrace section of the Great Mausoleum in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, in Los Angeles County, California. A traveling retrospective exhibition, &quot;Transparent Barricades: Ian Hornak, A Retrospective,&quot; co-sponsored by the Ian Hornak Foundation, began traveling to museums throughout the United States in 2011 and was scheduled to continue through 2016. Hornak&#x27;s artwork was the subject of a solo exhibition, on display during the 2013 Presidential Inauguration at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the Eccles Building in Washington D.C. under the sponsorship of the Ben Bernanke Administration.

<doc id="1138969" wikidata="Q2597051" url="?curid=1138969" title="Battle of Blackett Strait">
<text>The Battle of Blackett Strait (Japanese: ビラ・スタンモーア夜戦 (Battle of Vila–Stanmore)) was a naval battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought on 6 March 1943 in the Blackett Strait, between Kolombangara and Arundel Island in the Solomon Islands. The battle was a chance encounter between two Japanese destroyers that had been undertaking a resupply run to Vila and a U.S. Navy force of three light cruisers and three destroyers that had been tasked with bombarding the Japanese shore facilities around Vila. The two forces clashed as the Japanese destroyers were withdrawing through the Kula Gulf. In the short battle that followed the two Japanese destroyers were sunk, after which the U.S. ships completed their bombardment of Vila before returning to their base.

==Background==
After the American victory in the Guadalcanal campaign in early 1943, operations in the Solomon Islands shifted to the west, where the Japanese maintained a substantial garrison on Kolombangara. Airbases had been established at Munda on the western coast of New Georgia and at Vila on the southern coast of Kolombangara. Allied efforts to reduce these airbases initially focused on air strikes but later included naval bombardment in preparation for a ground campaign to capture New Georgia that would eventually commence in late June and early July 1943. Meanwhile, the Japanese continued to build up these bases as part of their efforts to reinforce the southern defenses to their main base around Rabaul.

On the night of 5 March 1943, the Japanese destroyers and took supplies to the Japanese base at Vila. Together, these ships formed part of the 2nd Fleet&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 4, which was under the command of Captain Masao Tachibana. Their passage to Vila was undertaken through the Vella Gulf and Blackett Strait, while they decided to return to the Shortland Islands via the shorter route through the Kula Gulf.

==Order of Battle==

==Battle==

As the Japanese ships withdrew through the Kula Gulf after landing their cargo, they encountered Task Force 68 (TF 68), consisting of three light cruisers (, , and ) and three destroyers (, , and ) commanded by Rear Admiral Aaron S. Merrill. This force was en route to commence bombarding Japanese positions at Vila. Two submarines, &quot;Grayback&quot; and &quot;Grampus&quot;, had been assigned to support Merrill&#x27;s force and were stationed along likely Japanese withdrawal routes out of the Kula Gulf. Merrill&#x27;s attack on Vila was timed to coincide with another attack on Munda by four destroyers under Captain Robert Briscoe.
In a short battle, both Japanese destroyers were sunk. The U.S. force was proceeding in a southwesterly direction about off the New Georgia coast, cruising at about . Meanwhile, the Japanese ships were sailing in the opposite direction along the east coast of Kolombangara, northeast from Sasamboki Island, roughly offshore from Stanmore. First contact was established by the U.S. radar operators around 00:57 on 6 March and firing commenced at 01:01. The U.S. cruisers engaged to starboard with their 6-inch guns at a range of around . 

Radar-controlled gunnery was in its infancy as a technique and there was a tendency for the initial barrage to fall on the same, usually nearest, target. In earlier naval battles in the Pacific, this tactical deficiency had allowed the Japanese to successfully engage attacking U.S. ships with torpedoes and had resulted in several losses for U.S. forces previously. In this case, the entire opening salvo straddled &quot;Murasame&quot;. As &quot;Minegumo&quot;″s captain began passing orders to his crew, &quot;Murasame&quot; was hit by the sixth salvo of American gunfire, which was followed shortly afterwards by a salvo of five torpedoes that had been fired by the destroyer &quot;Waller&quot;. At around 01:15, one of these torpedoes hit &quot;Murasame&quot;, which exploded, caught fire and eventually sank. The explosion was reportedly heard by Briscoe&#x27;s force about away around Munda. The U.S. cruisers then rapidly shifted target, doing so before &quot;Minegumo&quot; could release any torpedoes.

Meanwhile, &quot;Minegumo&quot; attempted to return fire, aiming for the flashes of the U.S. gun batteries off their starboard bow. After a few minutes, though, the second Japanese destroyer was also hit and began sinking in short order. As the surviving Japanese crew abandoned ship, firing ceased at 01:14. After the engagement, the U.S. vessels completed a turn to starboard when they were roughly due east of the Blackett Strait and north of Tunguirili Point. At 01:24, they commenced a northerly bombardment run off the Kolombangara coast, having been delayed by only 16 minutes. Under the direction of a reconnaissance aircraft flying overhead, the U.S. gunners targeted &quot;supply dumps, runways, bivouacs and dispersed aircraft&quot;, according to Samuel Morison. The bombardment was reportedly very destructive and accurate. Several Japanese shore batteries responded by firing on the bombarding ships but were knocked out quickly with counter-battery fire. After completing their task at 01:40, Merrill&#x27;s force withdrew through the New Georgia Sound.

==Aftermath==

A total of 174 Japanese sailors lost their lives during the battle on 6 March; 128 of these were from &quot;Murasame&quot;, while the rest were from &quot;Minegumo&quot;. The survivors swam to shore on Kolombangara. Fifty-three survivors from &quot;Murasame&quot; and 122 from &quot;Minegumo&quot; managed to reach Japanese lines. Two other survivors from &quot;Minegumo&quot; were later captured by U.S. forces. One of the U.S. submarines assigned to support the operation, &quot;Grampus&quot;, went missing and did not return to base at the end of its patrol. The submarine&#x27;s fate remains unknown, and it is uncertain if it was lost as a result of actions during the Blackett Strait operation or before. It was officially listed as missing, presumed lost on or before 3 March although there is a possibility it was attacked by &quot;Minegumo&quot; during the evening of 5/6 March.

===Mining operations===

On 20 March, the Allies began mining operations in the central Solomons using U.S. Navy and Marine Corps torpedo bombers to sow mines throughout the northern Solomons. After a month, these operations were briefly suspended as a result of Operation I-Go to free up AirSols aircraft to respond in the event of further attacks. In May, these operations resumed. On 7 May, the minelayers , , and , escorted by , laid mines across Blackett Strait in an attempt to interdict Japanese ships traveling through the strait. The next day, the Japanese destroyers , , and all hit mines in that area. &quot;Kuroshio&quot; sank immediately. &quot;Kagero&quot; and &quot;Oyashio&quot; sank later that day after being attacked and further damaged by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field following a radio report from an Australian coastwatcher on Kolombangara.

===&quot;PT-109&quot;===
Later in the year, with the ground campaign around Munda reaching a climax, another engagement occurred in Blackett Strait when a force of 15 PT boats, including Lieutenant (Junior Grade) John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;PT-109&quot; were sent to intercept the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; supply convoy on 2 August. In what National Geographic called a &quot;poorly planned and badly coordinated&quot; attack, 15 boats with 60 available torpedoes went into action. However, of the 30 torpedoes fired by PT boats from four sections, not a single hit was scored. In the battle, only four PT boats (the section leaders) had radar, and they were ordered to return to base after firing their torpedoes on radar bearings. When they left, the remaining boats were virtually blind.

Patrolling just after the section leader had departed for home, &quot;PT-109&quot; was run down on a dark moonless night by the Japanese destroyer , returning from the supply mission. The PT boat had her engines at idle to hide her wake from seaplanes. Conflicting statements have been made as to whether the destroyer captain spotted and steered towards the boat. Members of the destroyer crew believed the collision was not an accident, though other reports suggest &quot;Amagiri&quot;&#x27;s captain had not intentionally rammed &quot;PT-109&quot;. Kennedy&#x27;s crew was assumed lost by the U.S. Navy but were found later by Solomon Islander scouts Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana.

<doc id="1138975" wikidata="Q1265347" url="?curid=1138975" title="Duncan, British Columbia">
<text>Duncan (pop. 5,047 in 2021) is a city on southern Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. It is the smallest city by area (2.07 square kilometres, 0.8 square miles) in Canada. It was incorporated in 1912.

== Location ==
The city is about 45 kilometres from both Victoria to the south and Nanaimo to the north.

Although the City of Duncan has a population of just over 5,000, it serves the Cowichan Valley which has a population of approximately 90,000, many of whom live in North Cowichan and Cowichan Tribes. This gives Duncan a much larger perceived &quot;greater&quot; population than that contained within the city limits. People in areas of North Cowichan and bordering on Duncan usually use &quot;Duncan&quot; as their mailing address.

Duncan has one seat on the Cowichan Valley Regional District Board. The name &quot;Cowichan&quot; is an Anglicization of Halkomelem , which means &quot;the warm land&quot;.

== Transportation ==
The city is served by the Trans-Canada Highway which connects the city to Nanaimo in the north and Victoria to the south. Highway 1 through Duncan is a four-lane street with two signalized intersections (within the city limits) and a speed limit of 50 km/h. Duncan has a base maximum speed limit of 30 km/h.

British Columbia Highway 18 connects Duncan (via North Cowichan) to the town of Lake Cowichan to the west.

Public transit is provided in conjunction between BC Transit, the Cowichan Valley Regional Transit System and the Nanaimo Regional Transit System

Duncan is connected to the two largest communities on Vancouver Island, Nanaimo and Victoria, through regular bus service.

Public transit provides connections from Duncan to the surrounding communities including Lake Cowichan, Crofton, Chemainus, and Ladysmith as well as communities to the south including Cobble Hill, Shawnigan Lake and Mill Bay. Mill Bay service includes routing to the Malahat first nation and the Mill Bay to Brentwood Bay Ferry across the Saanich Inlet.

The Nanaimo Regional Transit System provides daily (except Sunday) bus service between Duncan and Nanaimo including a stop at the Nanaimo Airport.

The Island Rail Corridor railway line still passes through Duncan along the coast of Vancouver Island, but trains have long since stopped running on it. Both freight service and the Crown corporation VIA Rail passenger service have been suspended due to deferred maintenance on the rail line.

Duncan is serviced by the neighbouring Maple Bay Airport (YAQ) in North Cowichan, which offers services to Vancouver Downtown, Vancouver Airport, Ganges on Salt Spring Island and Bedwell Harbour on Pender Island. Service is provided by Saltspring Air and Harbour Air.

== History ==
The community is named after William Chalmers Duncan (born 1836 in Sarnia, Ontario). He arrived in Victoria in May 1862, then in August of that year he was one of the party of a 78 settlers which Governor Douglas took to Cowichan Bay. After going off on several gold rushes, Duncan settled close to the present City of Duncan. He married in 1876, and his son Kenneth became the first Mayor of Duncan. There is a Kenneth Street, as well as a Duncan Street, in the City.

Duncan&#x27;s farm was named Alderlea, and this was the first name of the adjacent settlement. In August 1886, the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway was opened. No stop had been scheduled at Alderlea for the inaugural train bearing Sir John A. Macdonald and Robert Dunsmuir. However, at Duncan&#x27;s Crossing, the level crossing nearest Alderlea, a crowd of 2,000 had assembled around a decorated arch and the train came to an unplanned halt. According to this legend, a train station was established at the settlement and the city built around it. Initially part of the District of North Cowichan, Duncan felt its needs as an urban settlement in the largely rural municipality were not being met, in particular the need to have proper roadways. After a particularly wet winter in 1911–1912, a vote was held to make Duncan a distinct city, and it was incorporated on 4 March 1912. With the enlargement of North Cowichan in the ensuing decades, there was an effort to re-unite the two municipalities, though a referndum on the matter in June 1978 was soundly defeated.

In the early 1900s, Duncan&#x27;s Chinatown was the social centre for the Cowichan Valley&#x27;s Chinese population. Chinatown was concentrated in a single block in the southwestern corner of Duncan. At its largest point, Duncan&#x27;s Chinatown included six Chinese families and 30 merchants who supplied goods and services to the loggers, millworkers, cannery and mine workers in the area. The city tore the buildings down in 1969 to build a new law courts complex. Some materials from the original buildings were used at Whippletree Junction.

In the 1980s, the city was noted in coverage related to the 1985 bombings at Narita Airport in Japan and aboard Air India Flight 182, Canada&#x27;s largest murder case. Resident Inderjit Singh Reyat purchased bomb parts and a radio at Duncan stores, and used the radio to conceal the bomb. Less than two weeks prior to the bombings, Reyat and suspected Air India mastermind Talwinder Singh Parmar were observed testing explosives in the woods outside of Duncan by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).

<text>Lorenzo De Medici Sweat (May 26, 1818 – July 26, 1898), also written L.D.M. Sweat, was a U.S. Representative from Maine.

==Early life and education==
He was born in the town of Parsonsfield in the Massachusetts District of Maine, where he attended Parsonsfield Seminary, a Free Will Baptist school. Sweat attended Bowdoin College, from which he graduated in 1837, and studied law with Rufus McIntire. He attended Harvard Law School, and after graduating in 1840 he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in New Orleans.

==Marriage and family==
Sweat returned to Maine and settled in Portland, where he continued to practice law. In 1849, he married novelist Margaret Jane Mussey and purchased a home adjoining author and critic, John Neal. The couple did not have children.

==Political career==
Sweat held various local offices including Portland City Solicitor from 1856 to 1860. He served as a member of the Maine State Senate from 1861 to 1862.

He was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-eighth Congress and served from March 4, 1863, to March 3, 1865. Being the only Democrat in Maine&#x27;s congressional delegation, he was the only one to oppose the Thirteenth Amendment. He was defeated for reelection in 1864, and was an unsuccessful candidate for election to Congress in 1866.

He later was a delegate to the Union National Convention held in Philadelphia in 1868, and to the 1872 Democratic National Convention. In 1872 he was selected as a member of the Democratic National Committee. He served until 1876.

He was an honorary commissioner to the World&#x27;s Exposition in Paris in 1867 and that in Vienna in 1873.

His house in Portland, the McLellan-Sweat Mansion, was later adapted for use as the Portland Museum of Art, following a bequest by his wife in 1908. The same bequest also included funding for what became the L. D. M. Sweat Memorial Galleries as an addition to the rear. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

He is interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine.

<text>A trust company is a corporation that acts as a fiduciary, trustee or agent of trusts and agencies. A professional trust company may be independently owned or owned by, for example, a bank or a law firm, and which specializes in being a trustee of various kinds of trusts.

The &quot;trust&quot; name refers to the ability to act as a trustee – someone who administers financial assets on behalf of another. The assets are typically held in the form of a trust, a legal instrument that spells out who the beneficiaries are and what the money can be spent for.

A trustee will manage investments, keep records, manage assets, prepare court accounting, pay bills (depending on the nature of the trust), medical expenses, charitable gifts, inheritances or other distributions of income and principal.

==Estate administration==
A trust company can be named as an executor or personal representative in a last will and testament. The responsibilities of an executor in settling the estate of a deceased person include collecting debts, settling claims for debt and taxes, accounting for assets to the courts and distributing wealth to beneficiaries.

Estate planning is usually also offered to allow clients to structure their affairs so as to minimize inheritance taxes and probate costs. In the United States, one of the primary profit centers for a trust company is commissions earned from selling various types of insurance products designed to minimize the estate tax charged to a person.

A trust officer may provide guardian and conservator services, acting as guardian of a minor&#x27;s property until adulthood or as conservator of the estate of an adult unable to handle his or her own finances.

===Environmental and historic preservation trusts===
Some trust companies are formed not merely for the benefit of a minor or an individual trustee, but for the preservation of nature or historic sites.

==Asset management==
A trust department provides investment management, including securities market advice, investment strategy and portfolio management, management of real estate and safekeeping of valuables.

==Escrow services==
The trust company may also provide escrow services, invest education or retirement funds or hold 1031 Exchange proceeds where cash from the sale of US real estate is held in trust (for tax purposes) until used to buy replacement land.

==Corporate trust services==
Trust companies may also perform corporate trust services. Corporate trust services are services which assist, in the fiduciary capacity, in the administration of the corporation&#x27;s debt. For example, in a normal bank loan, the lender normally lends money to the company (usually with conditions called &quot;covenants&quot;), accepts payments from the company monthly, and monitors the financial conditions of the company to ensure that it is meeting all its agreed upon conditions (for example, that its ratio of profits to expenses stays above a certain amount). However most large companies borrow money not from banks, but by selling bonds. When the company sells bonds, a corporate trust company can handle the acceptance of payments from the company (which it passes on to the bondholders), and is the entity which monitors the company to ensure it is meeting covenants. In the event of the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, the corporate trust company represents the interests of the bondholders and acts to recover as much of the loan proceeds as possible.

==Canadian banking services==
In Canada, trust companies have historically provided many of the same services as the big-five banks. They are legally not banks, but hold a &quot;near&quot;-bank status which situates them legally very close to the US savings and loan associations, UK building societies or other non-bank deposit-taking institutions such as credit unions.

According to the Canadian Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, &quot;trust and loan companies are financial institutions that operate under either provincial or federal legislation and conduct activities similar to those of a bank&quot;. Deposits and GICs are insured by the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation in the same manner as bank deposits.

While Canadian trust and loan companies nominally cannot accept retail deposits or issue debentures, they may receive money on deposit in trust, repayable on demand or after notice. As no statute prevents the companies from according chequing privileges to their depositors, effectively the trust companies are at liberty to receive monies which the depositor can treat much like bank savings or chequing accounts. The institution may then employ these assets (less a legally-required fractional reserve) to issue secured loans, such as mortgages.

Once a common feature on Canada&#x27;s retail banking landscape, free-standing retail trust companies are disappearing; the largest institutions have increasingly fallen prey to consolidation and takeover by the major banks. Prominent examples include Canada Trust (founded 1864 as Huron and Erie Savings and Loan Society, acquired by Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2000), Montreal Trust Company (established 1889, acquired by Scotiabank in 1994), National Trust Company (established 1898, acquired by Scotiabank in 1997) and Royal Trust (founded 1892, bought by Royal Bank of Canada in 1993). A few small or captive trust and loan companies, such as the Equitable Trust Company, B2B Trust and Civil Service Loan Corporation, have restructured to legally become federally-regulated banks.

Unlike banks, Canadian trust companies can administer estates, trusts, and pension plans. Banks cannot conduct these activities unless they are done through a separately created trust subsidiary. In 2023, there were 43 federally-regulated trust companies in Canada but many of these were owned or controlled by banks or other institutions as subsidiaries.

<text>The Eyemo is a 35 mm motion picture film camera which was manufactured by the Bell &amp; Howell Co. of Chicago.
==Background==
Designed and first manufactured in 1925, it was for many years the most compact 35 mm motion picture film camera, having a 100-foot film capacity. Its small size and ruggedness made it a favorite choice for newsreel and combat cameramen (it was used throughout World War II and the Vietnam War, the War Department providing special manuals for it), and also found use for fiction and documentary filmmakers whenever a portable, rugged, and inconspicuous camera was needed.

The Eyemo is still in use by some filmmakers. It is often used these days as a &quot;crash-cam&quot; for filming dangerous stunts and explosions, and shots in which the camera must be dropped from a building or other elevation.

The 2000 film &#x27;Requiem For A Dream&#x27; utilized an Eyemo camera with a Nikon lens mount for POV &#x27;snorricam&#x27; shots where it was attached to the actors. 

==Construction==

The Eyemo is a non-reflex camera: viewing while filming is through an optical viewfinder incorporated into the camera lid. Some models take one lens only. In 1929 there was the first three-port Eyemo, while the &quot;spider model&quot; features a rotating three-lens turret and a &quot;focusing viewfinder&quot; on the side opposite the optical viewfinder. Eyemos feature a 1½&quot; diameter lens mount except the 71-k model, which is slightly different.
Eyemos feature a built-in clockwork (spring wind) motor which, when wound by a ratchet key, can shoot about 20 seconds of film per winding at standard 24 fps (frames per second) speed, and also runs at speeds of four through 64 fps, depending on the model. The camera can be hand-cranked with a manual crank accessory. Several optional electric motors are available; some use DC battery power while others use household AC current. There is currently a synchronized motor available for sync sound filming, but no commercially available camera blimp to reduce the camera&#x27;s noise.

The Eyemo takes an internal load of 100 feet (30,5 m) of film, which lasts for slightly over one minute when filming at 24 fps. Some models also accept a 400 ft or 1000 ft magazine that is attached to the back, and can hold 4⅓ and 11 minutes of film respectively. When used with a 400 ft magazine, the Eyemo is cumbersome (but not impossible) to operate without the use of a tripod, while the use of a 1000-ft magazine requires tripod support.

Some camera shops have modified Eyemos for reflex viewing, attached video taps and motors to them, and modified the proprietary lens mount to allow the camera to use different optics (such as lenses made for still Nikon cameras).

Bell &amp; Howell also built the successful 16 mm &quot;Filmo&quot; which became first available at the end of 1923. In the 1930s, this camera was marketed as a &#x27;semi professional&#x27; camera while the Filmo 127 was introduced as an amateur camera using 8 mm film.
Various government and military organizations used specialty motion picture cameras based on the eyemo mechanics for scientific tests and filming. One manufacturer being MultiData. NASA was a notable organization that used such cameras in one case for testing with lasers. 

==Notable uses==
* &quot;With the Marines at Tarawa&quot; (1944) – shot by Marine Staff Sergeant Norman Hatch during the Battle of Tarawa
* &quot;Day of the Fight&quot; (1951) – short shot by Stanley Kubrick on a rented Eyemo
* &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) – Multiple cameras used to film shower scene
* The Blues Brothers (1980) - Multiple crash scenes and explosions
* Requiem For a Dream (2000) - All POV shots 
* &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (2011) – shot by Robbie Ryan

<doc id="1138988" wikidata="Q1355816" url="?curid=1138988" title="Asuka Langley Soryu">
<text>is a fictional character from the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; franchise created by Gainax. She first appears in the original anime series, and also appears in the franchise&#x27;s animated feature films and related media, including video games, the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. In Japanese, Yūko Miyamura voices Asuka in all her animated appearances and merchandise. In English, Tiffany Grant voices her in the ADV Films dub and Stephanie McKeon voices her in the Netflix dub.

Within the franchise, Asuka is designated as the Second Child and the fiery pilot of a giant mecha named Evangelion Unit-02 to fight against enemies known as Angels for the special agency Nerv. Because of childhood trauma, she has developed a competitive and outgoing character to get noticed by other people and affirm her own self. In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; films, her Japanese surname is changed to and she differs significantly in her background and characterization from her television series incarnation.

Series creator and director Hideaki Anno originally proposed her as the main protagonist of the series. Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto asked Anno to include a male main character instead, downgrading her to the role of co-protagonist with Shinji Ikari. Anno based her psychology on his personality, bringing his moods into the character, acting instinctively and without having thought about how the character would evolve. During the first broadcast of the series, he changed his plans, creating an evolutionary parable in which Asuka becomes more dramatic and suffers, intentionally going against the expectations of the fans. The Japanese voice actress Miyamura was also influential, deciding some details and some of Asuka&#x27;s lines.

Asuka maintained a high ranking in the series&#x27; popularity polls and has appeared in surveys to decide the most popular anime characters in Japan. Merchandising based on her has also been released, particularly action figures, which became highly popular. Some critics took issue with her hubris and her personality, judging these as tiresome and arrogant; others appreciated her realism and complex psychological introspection. Asuka is also one of the most successful and influential examples of the &quot;tsundere&quot; stereotype, characteristic of grumpy and arrogant characters with a fragile hidden side, helping to define its characteristics.

== Conception ==
In the early design stages of the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; anime, creator and director Hideaki Anno proposed including a girl similar to Asuka as the protagonist. Character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto proved reluctant to accept the idea of a female character in the lead role after Gainax&#x27;s previous works like &quot;Gunbuster&quot; and &quot;&quot;; he said: &quot;A robot should be piloted by a trained person, whether it is a woman or not makes no difference, but I cannot understand why a girl should pilot a robot&quot;. He thus asked the director to use a boy in the role of main character, downgrading Asuka to the role of female co-protagonist. Sadamoto modeled the relationship between her and the male protagonist Shinji Ikari taking inspiration from Nadia and Jean from &quot;The Secret of Blue Water&quot;. Asuka should have represented &quot;[Shinji&#x27;s] desire for the female sex&quot;, as opposed to Rei Ayanami&#x27;s &quot;motherhood&quot;, and should have been the idol of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. Anno also thought of her as Nadia La Arwal from &quot;The Secret of Blue Water&quot; with a different hairstyle. In the initial project, Asuka was described as &quot;a determined girl&quot; who adapts to the situation in which she finds herself, passionate about video games and &quot;aspires to become like Ryoji Kaji&quot;. In the nineteenth episode, she would have had to be seriously injured in her attempt to protect Shinji, who would have thus &quot;proved his worth&quot; trying to save her.

For the character&#x27;s name, Anno took inspiration from , the protagonist of the manga , written by Shinji Wada; for the surname, he merged the names of two ships used in the Second World War, the Japanese World War II aircraft carrier &quot;Soryu&quot; and the American aircraft carrier &quot;Langley&quot;. Despite her multi-ethnic origins, the staff made Asuka&#x27;s skin the same color as that of Rei Ayanami. For the German language terms used in the scenes with Asuka, staff asked for help from an American employee of Gainax, Michael House, who exploited his basic knowledge of the language, acquired in high school, and a Japanese-German dictionary from a local library. According to Anime News Network&#x27;s May Callum, Gainax did not pay attention to the dialogue&#x27;s German grammar, believing the series would never be successful enough to be watched by native German speakers.

For Asuka&#x27;s psychology, Anno relied on his personality, as with the other characters in the series. Staff originally inserted her after the first six episodes to lighten the tones of the series. She was presented with an exhilarating personality without foreshadowing her eventual depressing moments in the latter half. Anno said that he didn&#x27;t intend to go &quot;that far&quot; at first and that he didn&#x27;t completely grasp the character of Asuka until he made her &quot;Are you stupid?&quot; (あんたバカ?, &quot;Anta baka?&quot;) catchphrase, with which the character was definitively born. During the series&#x27;s first airing, the director began to criticize &quot;otaku&quot;, Japanese obsessed animation fans, accusing them of being excessively closed and introverted; therefore, he changed the atmosphere of the second half of the series, making the plot darker, violent, and introspective. Asuka&#x27;s story reflected the changes: although she had been introduced in an essentially positive role, her character became increasingly dramatic and introverted, going against the expectations and the pleasure principle of anime fans. In the twenty-second episode, Anno focused on Asuka&#x27;s emotional situation, harassed by her first menstrual cycle, but not considering himself capable of exploring such a feminine theme, he condensed everything into a single scene.

Miyamura&#x27;s interpretation was also important for Asuka&#x27;s characterization. During the production of the last episodes Anno inserted scenes in which staff represented Asuka with simple hand-drawn sketches, remaining satisfied with the result, saying: &quot;After having drawn Asuka with a marker, as soon as Yuko Miyamura gave it her voice, it was more Asuka than ever&quot;. Furthermore, the author&#x27;s original intent was to insert a long live action segment for the film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; (1997) centered on the character. The original segment focused on a normal day of Asuka, who would wake up in an apartment after drinking and spend the night with Tōji Suzuhara, with whom she would embark on a sexual and sentimental relationship. Misato Katsuragi would have been the roommate in the apartment next to her; Rei Ayanami would have been her colleague and her &quot;senpai&quot;. In the alternate universe of live action, Shinji would never have existed; walking the streets of Tokyo-2, however, Asuka would hear his voice calling her.

=== Voice ===
==== &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; ====
Yūko Miyamura voices Asuka&#x27;s character in all her appearances in the original series, and the later films, spin-offs, video games, and the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; film series. The only exception is an introspective scene from the twenty-second episode, when other female members of the cast replace the character&#x27;s voice during a metaphysical sequence. Miyamura had originally auditioned for the role of Rei, but staff felt her voice was too energetic, so she was offered Asuka instead.

According to Miyamura, Asuka&#x27;s dubbing proved difficult. She said she wished to &quot;erase &quot;Evangelion&quot;&quot; and forget her experience with it. Towards the end of the first broadcast, Miyamura suffered from bulimia and found herself in a disastrous psychic state, similar to that of Asuka&#x27;s character. After the release of the movie &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; (1997) she said, &quot;I think I had a kamikaze feeling during the voice-over&quot;. The voice actress identified herself so much with the character she took a conversation course in German, decided some of the character&#x27;s lines, and Asuka&#x27;s details, such as the cloth puppet in the shape of a monkey featured in her childhood flashbacks. One of her ideas was the German sentences Asuka utters in the twenty-second episode of the series in a telephone conversation with her stepmother.

When dubbing the last scene of &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, in which Shinji strangles Asuka, Shinji&#x27;s voice actress Megumi Ogata physically imitated his gesture and strangled her colleague. Because of her agitation, Ogata squeezed her neck too hard, risking having her not properly recite the rest of the film&#x27;s lines. With Ogata&#x27;s gesture, Miyamura could finally produce realistic sounds of strangulation and thanked her colleague for her availability. Anno based the scene on an incident that happened to one of his female friends. She was strangled by a malicious man, but when she was about to be killed, she stroked him for no reason. When the man stopped squeezing her neck, the woman regained a cold attitude, speaking the words that Asuka would have said to Shinji in the original script: .

Dissatisfied with Miyamura&#x27;s interpretation of the original last line, Anno asked her to imagine a stranger sneaking into her room, who could rape her at any time, but who prefers to masturbate by watching her sleep. The director asked her what she would say about this if she woke up suddenly, noticing what had happened. Miyamura, disgusted by the scene, replied saying . After the conversation, Anno changed the line by echoing the voice actress&#x27;s reaction.

==== &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga ====
Further difficulties arose during the dubbing sessions for the film &quot;&quot; (2012), the third installment of the &quot;Rebuild&quot; saga, set fourteen years after the previous movies. According to Miyamura, the scenario gave her &quot;very confused feelings&quot; and &quot;a constant feeling of light-headedness&quot;. Hideaki Anno did not explain the plot and setting of the film to her, complicating her work. At the beginning, however, she didn&#x27;t want to go back to dubbing the &quot;Rebuild&quot; and she was scared, given the suffering caused by &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;. After finishing the final film of the saga, &quot;&quot; (2021), Miyamura stated: &quot;I felt like a mother to Asuka at times. I cannot watch &quot;End of Evangelion&quot; even now because it&#x27;s too painful.&quot; Recording for &quot;Thrice Upon a Time&quot; was less stressful, but also taxing due to the many delays and revisions in production. At the end of the recording, Anno thanked her for playing the role of Asuka for twenty-five years; Miyamura furthermore noted Anno and Kazuya Tsurumaki orientated her far more than before.

During the recording of the feature film, she had to dub a scene in which Asuka screams in pain as she pulls an anti-Angel seal from her eye. When she recorded, the drawings for the sequence had not yet been completed, so she imagined the scenes involved, listening to the director&#x27;s explanations and trying to do her best to feel the required sensations. Screaming, she tried to use all her imagination and pretended to stab herself, as if flesh were being torn from her. The support of Megumi Ogata, Shinji&#x27;s voice actress who was already used to screaming in other &quot;Evangelion&quot; scenes, also helped her in the process. The last thing asked of her was to write the character&#x27;s full name in cursive herself to be used in the film. She had lived in Australia for the past two decades, but was still unsure of how to write &quot;Langley&quot;. Miyamura also played Soryu and Shikinami as two different people, but both with a strong desire to be better. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, her sessions were already finished; later, some points were resumed and re-recorded, so there was no precise prediction as to when the work would be finished. She still had difficulties in understanding the story, and had taken the habit of reading fan-made analysis to help herself.

==== English dub ====
Asuka is voiced by Tiffany Grant in English in the ADV films dub, and Stephanie McKeon in the Netflix dub. Grant felt playing Asuka was &quot;refreshing&quot;, as &quot;she says the most horrible things to people, things that you&#x27;d like to say to people and can&#x27;t get away with&quot;. Grant stated she greatly identified with the character, to the point of Asuka becoming a part of her: &quot;She&#x27;s kinda like my kid sister, which is why I feel the need to stick up for her&quot;. She also met Miyamura in conventions in the early 2000s and, discussing their experiences portraying Asuka, Miyamura rekindled their shared love and concern for the character&#x27;s happiness.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; ===
Asuka Langley Soryu was born on December 4, 2001. She is the daughter of Dr. Soryu Kyoko Zeppelin, an employee of a research center named Gehirn. She is of Japanese and German descent and has U.S. citizenship. In 2005 her mother participates in a contact experiment with the mecha Evangelion Unit 02, but, because of an accident, she suffers a severe mental breakdown, becoming permanently hospitalized. These injuries render her unable to recognize her child. Asuka is deeply hurt by her mother&#x27;s behavior, who speaks to a doll believing it to be her daughter. After some time, Asuka is chosen as the Second Child and Eva-02&#x27;s official pilot. Hoping that her selection could lead her mother to pay attention to her again, she excitedly runs to her room to announce the news, finding her mother&#x27;s corpse hanging from the ceiling. Shocked and traumatized by her mother&#x27;s suicide, Asuka adopts self-affirmation as the only reason to be, participating in training sessions to become a pilot and meet other people&#x27;s expectations.

Her custody is assigned to Ryoji Kaji, towards whom she is infatuated. In 2015, after graduating from a German university, Asuka leaves there, accompanied by Kaji and Unit 02, on board a United Nations aircraft carrier escorted by numerous warships to protect the Eva. During the trip, she meets Shinji Ikari, Third Child and pilot of Unit 01, and her new classmates Tōji and Kensuke. The United Nations fleet is then attacked by Gaghiel, the sixth Angel. Recognizing this event as a good chance to demonstrate her skills, Asuka independently activates her Eva, coercing Shinji into joining her in the cockpit. Despite struggling to work together, and the Eva not yet being equipped to operate underwater, the two children destroy the enemy. She is later placed in class 2-A of Tokyo-3 first municipal middle school, living with Shinji under Misato Katsuragi&#x27;s care. She teases Shinji continuously about his passivity and perceived lack of manliness, but gradually comes to respect and like him as they fight Angels together. She is rarely able to express these feelings. However, following a series of Angel battles where Shinji outperforms her, she grows increasingly unable to continue to suppress her traumatized psyche, drastically lowering her pilot skills. This comes to a head when the Angel Arael attacks; Asuka, burdened by her continually worsening performance in tests, tries to attack the Angel alone, but is overwhelmed by the Angel&#x27;s attack, a beam that penetrates her mental barrier and forces her to relive her darkest memories.

In the battle with the next Angel, Armisael, she cannot activate the Evangelion. As a result of this, Asuka loses all will to live, runs away and goes to the home of her friend Hikari Horaki, spending time aimlessly roaming the streets of Tokyo-3. She is eventually found by Nerv personnel, naked and starving in the bathtub of a ruined building. The main series ends with her lying in a hospital bed in a catatonic state.

=== &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; ===
In the movie &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; (1997), as the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense Force invades Nerv headquarters, Asuka is placed inside Unit 02, which is then submerged in a lake for her protection. As she is bombarded by depth charges, Asuka wakes up, declares she does not want to die, and, in a moment of clarity, feels her mother within the Eva. Her self-identity regained, she emerges and defeats the Self-Defence Force, before encountering nine mechas named Mass-Production Evas. Though she successfully disables all nine opponents, Eva-02&#x27;s power runs out; the power of the mass-produced Evas allows them to eviscerate and dismember Unit 02.

Seeing Asuka&#x27;s destroyed Evangelion makes Shinji go into a frenzy, which eventually culminates in him starting a catastrophic event named the Third Impact. Shinji and Asuka have an extended dream-like sequence inside Instrumentality, a process in which the soul of humanity merges into one collective consciousness. Shinji claims he wants to understand her, but she refuses. He is furious at her rejection and lashes out by choking her. At the end of the process, Shinji rejects Instrumentality, and she returns after him in a new world. In the film&#x27;s final scene, Shinji begins strangling Asuka, but stops when she caresses his face. Shinji breaks down crying and the film ends with Asuka disdainfully looking down on Shinji saying &quot;How disgusting&quot;, before cutting to black.

=== &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; ===
In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga, Asuka appears first in the second film, &quot;&quot; (2009). Changes have been made to her character, such as her family name being changed from to , continuing the Japanese maritime vessel naming convention. The name change resulted from a precise choice by Hideaki Anno, who said he had changed the background of the character. Asuka Shikinami Langley, compared to her original counterpart, seems more open and vulnerable. Near the end of the film, for example, she confides in someone for the first time talking genuinely about her feelings with Misato. She does not feel infatuated with Ryōji Kaji and maintains a more affectionate and peaceful relationship with Shinji. Although she publicly rejects others, she becomes possessive of Shinji, feeling jealous for him and taking an interest in his feelings.

During the production phase, screenwriter Yōji Enokido added a night scene in which Asuka, feeling alone, enters her colleague&#x27;s room without permission, sleeping next to him. In the course of events, she also plays video games and tries to cook something for Shinji. She is a captain of the European Air Force, faces the seventh Angel with her Eva-02, and is designated pilot of the Eva-03, whereas in the original series this Eva was piloted by Tōji Suzuhara. Unit 03 is later contaminated by a parasitic-type Angel, Bardiel, and collides with Eva-01; Asuka survives, but is last seen in urgent care.

In &quot;&quot; (2012), Asuka is initially part of the rescue operation for Eva-01, which is stranded in space, working together with Mari for an organization named Wille, which is dedicated to destroying Nerv. Convinced by Mari, she dons her old plugsuit in an attempt to get Shinji to recognize them. After fighting off an initial attack by Nerv, Asuka confronts Shinji in his holding cell and tells him fourteen years have passed. Asuka is chronologically twenty-eight years old, but has not physically aged due to what she calls the &quot;curse of Eva&quot;; she also wears an eyepatch that glows blue. Asuka, again supported by Mari, confronts Shinji and his co-pilot Kaworu Nagisa and eventually self-destructs her Eva during the fight. After the fight, she grabs Shinji&#x27;s wrist, and they move along the ruins of Tokyo-3, followed by Rei Ayanami.

==== &quot;Evangelion: 3.0+1.0&quot; ====
In the final film, &quot;&quot;, Asuka guides Shinji and Rei before being picked up by Kensuke Aida. She lives in a place named Village-3 in Kensuke&#x27;s house. She feels she is no longer human as a result of the changes to her body and lack of aging, growing indifferent to her well-being. In the course of the feature film she goes to check on Shinji&#x27;s distraught and almost catatonic state in silence; Miyamura described hers as the attitude of a mother &quot;who quietly leaves food in front of her son&#x27;s room to see how he is doing when he is locked up in his room&quot;. Shikinami eventually forces Shinji, completely helpless and no longer wanting to continue living, to eat by forcibly stuffing food into his mouth.

When Will&#x27;s ship AAA Wunder arrives to pick-up Asuka, Shinji insists on going with her. During the final battle in Antarctica Asuka is forced to take off her eyepatch, releasing the ninth Angel contained within. She converts Eva-02 to a new form, but is absorbed by Eva-13. Inside, Asuka meets the original member of the Shikinami clone series she&#x27;s a part of. Asuka is shown to have fought the other clones as a child before being selected as a pilot. Lamenting not having anyone to take care of her, Kensuke appears, dressed as her stuffed doll, and reassures her. Asuka is then present in an adult body, and Shinji thanks her for saying she liked him, and tells her he liked her as well, before he and Mari bid her farewell. In the final scene of the film, she is last seen on a train platform in a rebuilt world.

During &quot;3.0+1.0&quot;, Asuka confesses her feelings to Shinji by saying that she liked him; for Miyamura, the sentence would not imply that her love is over or that she now loves someone else, &quot;but that she genuinely wanted to tell him that&quot;. The actress also emphasized during the interviews that she did not interpret Kensuke and Asuka&#x27;s relationship as romantic, as Shikinami is still physically fourteen years old; according to her, Kensuke would only be a sort of parental reference figure, and even Anno said that the character&#x27;s last scene in &quot;Thrice Upon A Time&quot; is related to the image of Kensuke as a father figure for Shikinami. According to her, &quot;Kensuke is a warmth for those who are lonely or want to feel safe&quot;. During production, a scene in which Kensuke shoots Asuka with a camera was thought to be a love scene; however, the voice actress also interpreted this love as paternal. Tetsuya Iwanaga, Japanese interpreter of Kensuke, described his character as &quot;a friend she&#x27;s never quite been able to get rid of ever since middle school&quot;. In an interview, Iwanaga stated that he interpreted the scene in which Kensuke is seen disguised as Asuka&#x27;s rag doll as a representation of him becoming &quot;the prop that rescued Asuka&quot;. Miyamura also voiced a scene in which Asuka says &quot;baka Shinji?&quot; as a &quot;love letter&quot; to everyone who supported the couple.

=== In other media ===
In the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; manga, illustrated and written by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Asuka has a more immature character than her animated counterpart and her story is different; despite having a similar, familiar past, in the manga she was conceived through artificial fertilization, as the result of an experiment in eugenics. In her first actual battle against Gaghiel, whom she confronts alongside Shinji in the same Evangelion unit in the classic series, she fights alone, while Shinji later watches the recorded fight on a projector. In the next battle, Asuka and Shinji fight, as in the classic series, against Angel Israfel together; Sadamoto conceived their dance training as akin to a &quot;kiss&quot;, underlining their psychological connection. &quot;Kotaku&quot; also noticed how much of their relationship is &quot;absent&quot;, while she remains fixated on Kaji. In the comic her fellow pilot Kaworu Nagisa is also introduced before and interacts with her, immediately arousing her antipathy.

Further differences are presented in the last chapters of the manga, corresponding to the events of the movie &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;. In the feature film, the Eva-02 is dismembered by the Eva Series before Shinji&#x27;s arrival, while in the comic the Third Child intervenes in battle in her defense. In the final chapter of the comic, following the failure of Instrumentality, Shinji lives in a world where it snows again in Japan and where people do not seem to have any memory of recent events. The Third Child, traveling on a train to his new school, meets a girl similar to Asuka. According to Sadamoto, the Asuka-like girl is not concretely Asuka, but the symbol &quot;of an attractive woman that Shinji can meet in the new world&quot;.

In a scene from the last episode of the animated series, an alternate reality is presented with a completely different story than in the previous installments, where Asuka is a normal middle school student and a childhood friend of Shinji Ikari, the Evangelion units never existed, and Asuka did not experience any childhood trauma regarding her mother Kyōko. A similar version of events can be found in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days&quot;, and the parody series &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot;, where she behaves like a sister towards Shinji. In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse&quot;, Asuka is a foreign exchange student, and uses a whip in battle. She is also present in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Legend of the Piko Piko Middle School Students&quot;. The simulation game &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ayanami Raising Project&quot; includes an expansion in its PlayStation 2 version that allows the player to take on the role of Asuka&#x27;s guardian instead of Rei&#x27;s. She is also available as a romantic option in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion 2&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project&quot; and its manga adaptation. In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Anima&quot;, Asuka is older, more stable and mature, having developed a strong friendship with Shinji and even Rei. Asuka also merges with her Eva unit turning into a hybrid named Crimson A1.

She also appears in the crossover &quot;Transformers x Evangelion&quot;, in the video games based on the original animated series and media not related to the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise, including &quot;Honkai Impact 3rd&quot;, &quot;Monster Strike&quot;, &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;, &quot;Tales of Zestiria&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Keri hime sweets&quot;, &quot;Summons Board&quot;, &quot;Puyopuyo!! Quest&quot; and in an official &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot; cross-over episode. In the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; franchise, she butts heads with Kouji Kabuto, the pilot of &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; and &quot;Mazinkaiser&quot;. It is also implied that she developed crushes on famous heroes such as Char Aznable and Amuro Ray, but proves jealous of Shinji, who crushes for Lynn Minmay of the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise.

== Characterization and themes ==
Asuka is an energetic, proud and enterprising girl with a brave and resolute character. She tends to look down on other people and wants to be constantly at the center of attention. Although she normally shows a stubborn and exuberant attitude, in some moments she exhibits a kinder, more sensitive and caring side. Her abrupt and impulsive ways often arouse other people&#x27;s antipathy, since they do not fully understand her real intentions. Unlike fellow pilots Shinji and Rei, she is extremely proud to be a pilot and engages in missions with great enthusiasm, but despite her apparently strong, aggressive and competitive character, Asuka suffers from the same sense of alienation as her companions.

Asuka suffers from a masculine protest, a psychological expression that indicates exaggeratedly masculine tendencies in tired and rebellious women who protest against traditional female gender roles. She sees her male peers merely as rivals and spectators of her abilities, and suffers from a marked emotional complex for the male sex, merging a so-called &quot;radical rivalry&quot; and a latent inferiority complex. Her masculine protest is reflected in her strong misandric tendencies, since she is dominated by the need to beat male peers with an obsessive self-affirmation desire. Despite this, she also has a sense of admiration for her guardian and &quot;senpai&quot;, Ryōji Kaji. Asuka is emotionally dependent on him, since she has a strong unconscious desire to find a reference figure to rely on. Asuka&#x27;s infatuation also leads her to feel great jealousy for him and to seduce him. &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine noted how she sometimes beats boys while being kind to Kaji.

Asuka&#x27;s excessive pride prevents her from admitting—even to herself—that she feels something for male protagonist Shinji. This leads her to attack Shinji&#x27;s virility continuously, directing both interest and open hostility towards him. As events and battles unfold, her feelings of love and hate intensify and dominate her. She kisses Shinji in the fifteenth episode, but when he beats her in pilot tests, she develops an inferiority complex towards him. Because of their intimate fragility and insecurities, Shinji and Asuka are unable to communicate effectively with one another on an emotional level, despite their mutual latent interest. According to &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine, Shinji has feelings for her, while Asuka openly states her feeling of being frustrated with wanting him as her partner, so &quot;her feelings for him as a man are less than they appear to be&quot;. According to critic Susan J. Napier, they might be expected to develop a romantic attraction for each other, but their sexual tension is subsumed under Asuka&#x27;s intense competitiveness; Napier also noted that Shinji feels fear and attraction towards the maternal figures of the women around him, such as Rei or Misato, but only Asuka &quot;is allowed to seem explicitly sexual&quot;.

In one scene from &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; movie, Asuka is seen on a bed while she speaks with an angry expression, interpreted by writers Kazuhisa Fujie and Martin Foster as a representation of Shinji&#x27;s libido. Asuka is framed while she has sexual intercourse with her partner, in a position described by an official artbook as &quot;of the cowgirl&quot;. According to an official card game, moreover, neither Yui, nor Rei and nor Misato could be a woman for Shinji, while Asuka, the only girl equal to him, becomes the center of his desire. Shinji however uses her as an object to console himself and ending up hurting her. Despite this, in the last scene Shinji meets Asuka in the new world after the failure of Instrumentality, just as he had wished. Asuka&#x27;s relationship with Rei Ayanami is also conflictual. She despises Rei, calling her and &quot;mechanical puppet girl&quot;. In a scene from the twenty-second episode, Rei and Asuka are left alone in an elevator; Rei states she is ready to die for Commander Gendō Ikari, provoking Asuka&#x27;s anger, who slaps her and says she has hated her from the moment they met. Shortly thereafter, Rei helps her during the fight against Arael, an act that destroys her already wounded pride.

Her ostentatious competitiveness originates from her childhood experiences, marked by the mental illness and the suicide of her mother, Kyōko. Asuka faced her loss by immersing herself in pride, becoming indisposed to any kind of help or advice and adopting strength and self-affirmation as her only &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. Tormented &quot;by the fear of not being necessary&quot;, she pilots Unit-02 only to satisfy her intimate desire for acceptance, longing to be considered &quot;an elite pilot who will protect humanity&quot;. She also wants to be recognized by others through her role as a pilot and has been described as a perfectionist. Her excessive self-confidence leads her to clash with Shinji, gradually losing self-confidence and becoming psychologically and physically compromised. The Fourth Child&#x27;s selection, Tōji Suzuhara, also contributes to the destruction of her pride. After she learns of Kaji&#x27;s death, she questions the meaning of her life and her identity, avoiding any kind of human contact and never meeting the gaze of other people.

Overwhelmed by the fear of being alone, the young woman shows that she has a great and morbid need for the Eva, even more than her colleague Shinji has. In a scene from the twenty-fifth episode, she excoriates the Evangelion unit as a &quot;worthless piece of junk&quot;, but immediately admits &quot;I&#x27;m the junk&quot;. In the director&#x27;s cut version of the twenty-second episode, two scenes set in the ninth and fifteenth episodes were added, in which Asuka appears frustrated in front of the sliding door of her room and after the kiss with Shinji; from Asuka&#x27;s dialogue that overlaps these scenes, it becomes clear that she has been looking for help and love from Shinji. Her self-love represents an act of psychological compensation to be recognized in the eyes of other people. After her mother&#x27;s mental illness, she represses her sadness and eventually decides to not cry anymore and to behave like an adult with a reaction formation. Her memories related to her past and her mother are repressed and removed from her consciousness during this phase. In the last episodes, Asuka completely loses her self-confidence. She develops a deep disgust with herself and suffers from separation anxiety. The caption also appears in the same episodes. The word attachment in psychology can also refer to the emotional bond that is established between the mother and her child; Asuka therefore boards the Eva-02 like a child who instinctively clings to its mother figure.

Miyamura noted that Asuka was not called &quot;tsundere&quot; at the time, but agreed to the definition of her having to hide her feelings in 2007. Furthermore, for Japanese philosopher and cultural critic Hiroki Azuma, she is the &quot;symbol of the outside&quot; in the world of &quot;Evangelion&quot;, taking Shinji away from his comfort zone in the &quot;Nerv family&quot;; in contrast to Rei, who&#x27;d play an &quot;imaginary healing&quot; role, Asuka would be an independent person in reality. Critics also noted that Asuka is iconographically and psychologically opposed to Rei. Rei has blue hair and red eyes and is often associated with the Moon, while Asuka has red hair and blue eyes and is presented in the eighth episode, &quot;Asuka Strikes!&quot;, silhouetted by the Sun. Rei is also related to white; writer Claudio Cordella noted how white is associated in Japanese culture with sanctity, light, eternity, while red is the color of sterile sexuality, traditionally chosen by unmarried girls or geisha for their kimono. Japanese psychiatrist Kōji Mizobe linked Asuka&#x27;s red to menstruation, compared to Rei&#x27;s white to altruism, attributing Asuka&#x27;s unstable behavior to a narcissistic or histrionic personality disorder. Writer Dennis Redmond instead noted that Shinji&#x27;s Eva-01 is purple, halfway between Rei&#x27;s blue Eva-00 and Asuka&#x27;s 02, describing Rei as a symbol of an empty and &quot;lyric neonational interiority&quot;, while Asuka as a mirror of a pragmatic and &quot;outrageous multinational exteriority&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; has written on how the two are different shades of the same spectrum of &quot;feminine&quot;, neither of which is good or bad in themselves, and which Shinji must recognize as autonomous individuals by overcoming the Madonna–whore complex — the inability of some men to see women in their individual nuances, perceiving them dichotomously either as angelic beings or maleficent entities.

The three Children have been compared to the three stages of the human soul postulated by the Jewish Kabbalah: Asuka to &quot;Nephesh&quot;, source of animal vitality, Shinji to &quot;Ru&#x27;ah&quot;, the soul, fruit of the raising of man from his purely biological aspect, and Rei to &quot;Neshamah&quot;, the spirit, fruit of the connection between man and God. Critic Patrick Drazen linked Asuka to Ama-no-Uzume, a Shinto female deity associated with dance and sensuality. Hiroki Azuma also described Asuka and the other characters in the series as &quot;stereotypical characters&quot;, with no particular individual or aesthetic characteristics; Asuka, in particular, has been described as a &quot;typical sci-fi anime character&quot;. According to Azuma, however, with these stereotypical characters Anno would have been able to describe the 1990s. Mizobe described her and Shinji as &quot;communicationally disabled&quot;, a feature that allowed contemporary Japanese youth to identify with them even twenty-six years after the original series&#x27;s airing. Moreover, for the critic Manabu Tsuribe in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; she represents for Shinji the Other, another person separated from himself with whom he can never become one. For Tsuribe, the film concludes when Shinji recognizes Asuka as a separate entity. The Anime Café&#x27;s Japanese critic Akio Nagatomi, noting how other characters in &quot;Evangelion&quot; bear similarities with others from &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, a previous work by Gainax and Anno, described Asuka as a counterpart to Jung Freud. Engineer Yumiko Yano also compared Asuka&#x27;s dull gaze in the final episodes, locked up in a hospital room after a psychic and emotional breakdown, to the dolls of artist Katan Amano.

== Cultural impact ==
=== Popularity ===
Asuka appeared in polls on best anime pilots and female anime characters, proving popular among both female and male audiences. In 1996 she ranked third among the &quot;most popular female characters of the moment&quot; in the Anime Grand Prix survey by &quot;Animage&quot; magazine, behind Rei Ayanami and Hikaru Shido from &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;. In 1997 and 1998 Anime Grand Prixes, she remained among the top ten female characters; in 1997 she ranked in fourth place, while in 1998 she ranked sixth. Asuka also appeared in the magazine&#x27;s monthly surveys, remaining in the top twenty in 1996, 1997 and 1998 polls. In 1999, &quot;Animage&quot; ranked her fortieth among the one hundred most popular anime characters.

Her popularity increased after the release of the second &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; movie; in August and September 2009 she emerged in first place and remained the most popular female &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; character in &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine popularity charts, while in October she ranked tenth. In a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll in March 2010, she was voted the third most popular female anime character from the 1990s, immediately after Rei Ayanami and Usagi Tsukino from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;.

In February 2015, almost twenty years after the show first aired, she emerged again on the magazine&#x27;s charts in sixth place. In 2017, she also ranked sixteenth among the characters Anime! Anime! site readers would &quot;rather die than marry&quot;. Her line &quot;Are you stupid?&quot; (あんたバカ?, &quot;Anta baka?&quot;) also became widely used among hardcore fans after her first appearance in the eighth episode. In 2021, after the release of the final &quot;Rebuild&quot; film, Asuka ranked most popular female character in another &quot;Newtype&quot; poll.

=== Critical reception ===

Asuka divided anime critics, receiving an ambivalent response. Negative reviews criticized her arrogant, surly and authoritarian character. While appreciating her for providing &quot;a good dose of comic relief&quot; to &quot;Evangelion&quot;, Anime Critic Pete Harcoff described her as &quot;an annoying snot&quot;. Raphael See from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, who found &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;″s characterization &quot;a little cliché, or just plain irritating at times&quot;, despised Asuka for her arrogant attitude. &quot;Anime Reign&quot; writer Matthew Perez described her as initially &quot;overly stuck up&quot;, but he also appreciated her evolution. By contrast, &quot;IGN&quot; critic Ramsey Isler ranked her as the thirteenth greatest anime character of all time for the realism of her characterization, saying: &quot;She&#x27;s a tragic character, and a complete train wreck, but that is what makes her so compelling because we just can&#x27;t help but watch this beautiful disaster unfold.&quot; Comic Book Resources included her among the best anime female pilots, describing her as &quot;the best classic &quot;tsundere&quot; in &quot;shounen&quot; anime&quot; and &quot;one of the most fascinating characters in anime&quot;.

Screen Rant ranked her among the best &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; characters, praising her development. According to critic Jay Telotte, Asuka is &quot;the first credible multinational character&quot; in the history of Japanese science fiction television. Crunchyroll and Charapedia also praised her realism and personality. Asuka&#x27;s fight sequence against the Mass-Production Evangelions in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; was particularly well-received by website Anime Critic, while Tiffany Grant was praised for her role as Asuka&#x27;s English voice actress by Mike Crandol of Anime News Network.

Animation Insider reviewer Eric Surrell commented on Asuka&#x27;s role in &quot;&quot; (2009), the second installment of the &quot;Rebuild&quot; saga, stating that &quot;the arrival and sudden dismissal of Asuka was shocking and depressing, especially considering how integral she was to the original &quot;Evangelion&quot;&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Simon Abrams, reviewing &quot;Evangelion: 2.0&quot;, responded negatively to Shinji and Asuka&#x27;s new relationship, &quot;which is unfortunate because that bond should have the opportunity to grow in its own time&quot;. &quot;LA Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Brian Miller appreciated her debut, praising Shinji&#x27;s &quot;downright charming&quot; courtship. The Fandom Post found the character neglected by Anno&#x27;s script, given the lesser space devoted to her and Mari&#x27;s introduction, while Renan Fontes from Comic Book Resources judged Asuka Shikinami significantly less interesting than Langley. UK Anime Network on the other hand found &quot;Rebuild&quot;&#x27;s Asuka a more human and easier to empathize with character than the one of the classic series.

=== Legacy ===
Asuka&#x27;s character has been used for merchandising items such as life-size figures, action figures, guitars, clothes, and underwear, some of which sold out immediately. Her action figures proved successful. According to Japanese writer Kazuhisa Fujie, &quot;Evangelion&quot;-related household items with the image of Asuka or other female characters of the series have become so popular that they have been put back on the market with a second edition. Movic has also released a cassette drama featuring her and Shinji as part of its &quot;Animate&quot; series featuring other popular works. On February 27, 1997, Kadokawa Shoten published a book dedicated to her entitled . In 2008, Broccoli released a video game entitled &quot;Shin Seiki Evangelion: Ayanami Ikusei Keikaku with Asuka Hokan Keikaku&quot;, in which the player takes on the task of looking after Asuka or Rei Ayanami.

Japanese celebrities cosplayed her during concerts or tours, such as Haruka Shimazaki, singer Hirona Murata and Saki Inagaki. Lai Pin-yu, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party and Legislative Yuan member, held election rallies cosplaying Asuka, gaining popularity. Asuka&#x27;s character was parodied by Excel from &quot;Excel Saga&quot; and some of her aesthetic and character traits inspired other female characters. &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Richard Eisenbeins listed her as an example of the &quot;tsundere&quot; stereotype, a term used to indicate grumpy, assertive and authoritarian characters that nonetheless possess a more gentle, empathetic and insecure side, hidden due to a stormy past or traumatic experiences. Anthony Gramuglia from Comic Book Resources identified her as one of the most popular and influential &quot;tsundere&quot; characters, comparing Asuna Yūki from &quot;Sword Art Online&quot;, Rin Tōsaka from &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, Kyō Sōma from &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; and Taiga Aisaka from &quot;Toradora!&quot; to her. Critics also compared Mai Shibamura from &quot;Gunparade March&quot;, Michiru Kinushima from &quot;Plastic Memories&quot; and D.Va from &quot;Overwatch&quot; game series to Asuka.

Japanese band L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel took inspiration from the character for their song &quot;Anata&quot;. Further references have been identified in other Japanese animated series, including &quot;Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gurren Lagann&quot;, and &quot;Sword Art Online&quot;, in which a scene of her and Rei in an elevator from the twenty-second episode is parodied.

<text>Abbotsbury Castle is an Iron Age hillfort in south west Dorset, England, situated on Wears Hill above the village of Abbotsbury, seven miles west of Dorchester and the famous hill fort at Maiden Castle.

It is situated on a high chalk hill overlooking the English Channel, and in its day was the front line of defence from invasion. The earthworks cover an area of about , of which about are inside the ramparts.

The fort was occupied by the Celtic Durotriges tribe, but when the Romans invaded in AD 43, the second Augustian legion of Vespasian took the fort quickly with little struggle before moving on to Maiden Castle. There is no evidence that the Romans settled at Abbotsbury Castle as they did at some other hill forts.

<text>In American football, the Holy Roller was a controversial game-winning play by the Oakland Raiders against the San Diego Chargers on September 10, 1978, at San Diego Stadium in San Diego, California. It was officially ruled as a forward fumble by Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler that was recovered by his teammate, tight end Dave Casper, in the end zone for a touchdown, giving Oakland the 21–20 win. However, there have been differing interpretations of how this play should have actually been ruled, and it has remained a controversial play for fans of both teams involved. The NFL amended its rules after the 1978 season to prevent a recurrence of the play. Chargers fans refer to the play as the Immaculate Deception.

==The play==

With 10 seconds left in the game, the Raiders had possession of the ball at the Chargers&#x27; 14-yard line, trailing 20–14. Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler took the snap and found himself about to be sacked by Chargers linebacker Woodrow Lowe on the 24-yard line. The ball came out of Stabler&#x27;s hands and moved forward towards the Chargers&#x27; goal line. Raiders running back Pete Banaszak appeared to try to recover the ball on the 12-yard line, but did not keep his footing, and pitched the ball with both hands even closer to the end zone. Raiders tight end Dave Casper was the next player to reach the ball but he also seemingly could not get a handle on it. He batted and kicked the ball into the end zone, where he fell on it for the game-tying touchdown as time ran out. With the ensuing extra point by placekicker Errol Mann, the Raiders won 21–20.

According to the NFL rulebook, &quot;If a runner intentionally fumbles forward, it is a forward pass.&quot; Also during the play, the game officials ruled that Banaszak and Casper&#x27;s actions were legal because it was impossible to determine if they intentionally batted the ball forward, which would have been ruled a penalty. The National Football League (NFL) also supported referee Jerry Markbreit&#x27;s call that Stabler fumbled the ball instead of throwing it forward.

For years, Stabler publicly stated that it was a fumble. However, in a 2008 interview on NFL Films, he was asked if he could convince the camera crew that he did not flip the ball forward. Stabler responded, &quot;No, I can&#x27;t convince you of that, because I did. I mean, what else was I going to do with it? Throw it out there, shake the dice.&quot; Banaszak and Casper also admitted that they deliberately batted the ball towards the end zone.

==Effect on 1978 NFL season==
Had the Chargers won this game — and, importantly, had all other games that season remained with the same outcome — they would have made the playoffs as one of the two wildcard teams, by virtue of a tiebreaker over the Houston Oilers. Both the Chargers and Oilers would have finished with a 10–6 record, but as the Chargers&#x27; final game of the season was a 45-24 victory over the Oilers in Houston in week 16, the Chargers would have won the tiebreaker on a head-to-head matchup and clinched the fifth seed in the postseason. The final Houston-San Diego game therefore would have had direct playoff consequence, with the winner advancing to the playoffs and the loser being eliminated, rather than being the relatively meaningless game it ended up as, with the Chargers already eliminated and the Oilers already having clinched a wildcard berth.

However, one direct consequence of San Diego’s poor start to the 1978 season (they were 1–4 after five weeks and 2–6 at the halfway mark) was the resignation of head coach Tommy Prothro and his replacement by former St. Louis Cardinals coach Don Coryell following a 24-3 loss to Green Bay in week 4. Had the Chargers won this game, the likelihood exists that, at 2–2 rather than 1–3, Prothro may not have chosen to resign as San Diego’s coach at that point. As Coryell’s coaching style and wide-open offensive attack (dubbed &quot;Air Coryell&quot;) were crucial to the Chargers’ drastic turnaround in 1978, and subsequent playoff run from 1979 to 1982, it is possible that their loss in the Holy Roller game helped propel San Diego into one of the most successful periods in the franchise’s history; and equally possible that a Prothro-coached team throughout 1978 may not have put together the same run of late-season victories to be in the position of playing a &quot;win-and-in/loser-goes-home&quot; game against the Oilers.

As for Oakland, their uneven and ultimately disappointing 1978 season resulted in the team missing the playoffs for the first time since 1971. Losing the Holy Roller game, with all other outcomes remaining as they were, would simply have eliminated the Raiders from playoff contention earlier in the season.

The Chargers would more directly avenge the outcome of this game with a late-game 27-23 victory over the Raiders in Oakland during week 9, kick-starting their 7–1 second season-half rally.

==Reaction==
Chargers fans responded with T-shirts depicting a blindfolded referee signaling a touchdown along with the words &quot;Immaculate Deception&quot;. The nickname was a play off the Immaculate Reception, a play that went against the Raiders in the 1972 playoffs against Pittsburgh.

In response to the Holy Roller, the league passed new rules in the off-season, restricting fumble advances by the offense. If a player fumbles after the two-minute warning in a half/overtime, or on fourth down at any time during the game, only the fumbling player can recover and advance the ball. If that player&#x27;s teammate recovers the ball during those situations, it is placed back at the spot of the fumble, unless it was a recovery for a loss, in which case the ball is dead and placed at the point of recovery.

The Holy Roller play was directly referenced on December 14, 2014, in response to a critical play in the Green Bay Packers&#x27; loss to the Buffalo Bills. When Aaron Rodgers had the ball knocked out of his hand by Mario Williams, it rolled backward into the end zone and came to a complete stop; Packer RB Eddie Lacy picked up the ball and was going to run with it, but the referee approached quickly, waving his hands to declare the play dead with Lacy&#x27;s recovery recorded for a loss, and after talking to the back judge, signaled a safety for Buffalo. The NFL Director of Officiating said that since the Holy Roller rules were in place, the only player who could have picked up the fumble and advanced it for Green Bay was the original fumbler (Rodgers), and the safety call was correct.

The Holy Roller rule negated a game-winning touchdown in a Week 15 2020 game between Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers, the two teams involved in the original play. After Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert fumbled while attempting a sneak at the Las Vegas 1 yard line on the first play within the two minute warning, Chargers fullback Gabe Nabers recovered in the end zone. Referee John Hussey explained that in these conditions, the ball should be placed at the spot of the fumble since the fumbler&#x27;s teammate recovered for a gain. Herbert would rush for the game-winning score the next play.

<doc id="1138993" wikidata="Q209251" url="?curid=1138993" title="2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine">
<text>2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) is a psychedelic drug of the amphetamine and 4-substituted-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (DOx) families. It is relatively little-used as a recreational drug but is frequently used in scientific research in the study of psychedelics and serotonin receptors.

DOI acts as a potent serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. The compound has a stereocenter, and &quot;R&quot;-(−)-DOI is the more active stereoisomer. [125I]-&quot;R&quot;-(−)-DOI is used as a radioligand and indicator of the presence of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in studies.

DOI&#x27;s effects have been compared to LSD, although there are differences that experienced users can distinguish. Besides the longer duration of DOI compared to LSD, the trip tends to be more energetic than an LSD trip, with more body load and a different subjective visual experience. The after effects include residual stimulation and difficulty sleeping, which, depending on the dose, may persist for days. While rare, DOI has sometimes been sold as a substitute for LSD, or even sold falsely as LSD, which may be dangerous because DOI does not have the same established safety profile as LSD.

DOI was first synthesized in 1973, by Coutts and Malicky. Unlike many other psychedelic drugs, DOI is not an explicitly controlled substance in the United States. However, it could be considered a controlled substance under the Federal Analog Act. In any case, its non-controlled status has made DOI usefully accessible for use in scientific research, which has contributed to its popularity for such uses. In December 2023, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) proposed making DOI a schedule I controlled substance. This proposal has been opposed by psychedelic researchers and the DEA has consequently delayed its June 2024 hearing on the proposal.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
====Actions====
DOI is a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonist. It is said to be approximately 5- to 12-fold selective for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.

The drug is not a monoamine releasing agent of serotonin or dopamine.

DOI is an agonist of the rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).

====Effects====
(&quot;R&quot;)-DOI and several other serotonergic psychedelics, including TCB-2, LSD, and LA-SS-Az, have been found to show potent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced inflammation. (&quot;R&quot;)-DOI was the most active of the assessed drugs and showed extremely high potency that was in the picomolar range and was an order of magnitude more potent than its action as a hallucinogen. TNFα may play a mediating role in the pathophysiology of degenerative inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. (&quot;R&quot;)-DOI has also been found to block pulmonary inflammation, mucus hyperproduction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and to turn off key genes in pulmonary immune response, effects which block the development of allergic asthma in animal models. These findings could make DOI and other serotonin 5-HT2A agonists novel treatments for inflammatory conditions.

DOI has been shown to induce rapid growth and reorganization of dendritic spines and synaptic connections with other neurons, processes known to underlie neuroplasticity, and hence to be a psychoplastogen.

==Chemistry==
DOI, also known as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine or as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo-α-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative and a member of the DOx family of drugs. It is structurally related to the naturally occurring phenethylamine psychedelic mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine). Other closely related DOx drugs include DOM, DOB, DOC, and DOF, among many others.

==History==
DOI was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. The radioactive iodine-125 form of DOI for PET imaging was first developed in the lab of David E. Nichols.

In January 2007, British police reported that three young men had fallen ill, reportedly, after taking DOI at a rave in Biggleswade, near Milton Keynes, and warned others who had taken it to seek medical attention. This would appear to be the first indication that DOI has found more widespread use as a recreational drug in the UK.

South Australian man Cody Edwards who brutally murdered Synamin Bell controversially plead guilty to the lesser sentence of manslaughter after attesting that the drug DOI had induced paranoia, and that he had subsequently acted in ‘self-defence’ when he had beaten the mother-of-three to death with a dumbbell, resulting in over fifty wounds.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
====Australia====
The Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP) of Australia does not list DOI as a prohibited substance.

====Canada====
Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine. The CDSA was updated as a result of the &quot;Safe Streets and Communities Act,&quot; changing amphetamines from Schedule 3 to Schedule 1.

====Denmark====
Illegal since 8 April 2007.

====Finland====
DOI is classified as a psychoactive substance banned from the consumer market in Finland.

====Sweden====
&quot;Sveriges riksdag&quot; added DOI to schedule I (&quot;substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use&quot;) as narcotics in Sweden as of August 30, 2007, published by &quot;Medical Products Agency&quot; in their regulation LVFS 2007:10 listed as DOI, 4-jod-2,5-dimetoxi-amfetamin.

====United States====
As of 2023, DOI is not scheduled in the United States, but it is likely that DOI would be considered an analog (of DOB), in which case, sales or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act. In December 2023, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would classify both DOI and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine (DOC) as schedule I controlled substances. However, in May 2024, it was reported that the DEA&#x27;s June 10, 2024 hearing on scheduling of DOI and DOC had been postponed. This followed opposition to the proposal by psychedelic researchers. DOI is frequently used in scientific research due in considerable part to its non-scheduled status, and DOI becoming a controlled substance would cause problems for scientists.

DOI is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida.

<text>Foxrock () is an affluent suburb of Dublin, Ireland. It is within the county of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, in the postal district of Dublin 18 and in the Roman Catholic parish of Foxrock.

==History==
The suburb of Foxrock was developed by William and John Bentley and Edward and Anthony Fox, who, in 1859, leased the lands of the Foxrock Estate from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and Richard Whately, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, with the aim of creating an affluent garden suburb.

The development was facilitated by the existence of the Harcourt Street railway line, built in 1854, that put Dublin city within commuting distance. The developers donated a site to the Dublin Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company for Foxrock railway station, which opened in 1861. In 1862, the following advertisement was placed in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;:

Beautiful building sites for mansions and pretty villas – Foxrock estate. The improvements recently made on this property, and still progressing, together with its natural attractions render these sites unrivalled for suburban residences. The scenery (green and mountain) from Brighton Road just finished, leading from the hotel at Foxrock station to Carrickmines, is magnificent. The land, being undulating, affords perfectly sheltered positions on Torquay Road, to the railway station at Stillorgan and Foxrock, as well as others elevated and more bracing. The rents required are exceedingly moderate: leases for 900 years are granted. Bricks, stones, lime and sand from the estate are sold at reduced prices to tenants. Stage coaches and omnibuses ply regularly between Foxrock station and Kingstown. Fare 3 pence and 4 pence. There is cheap and excellent shopping at Foxrock market. The railway subscription only £7 per annum. Apply to W.W. Bentley, Foxrock, or Bentley and Son, 110 College Green.

The racecourse, Leopardstown Racecourse, was completed in 1888, and is the only remaining horse track in the greater metropolitan area. The golf club opened in 1898.

==Geography==
The three main roads of the original development of Foxrock remain Brighton, Torquay and Westminster Roads. The boundaries of Foxrock as used by &quot;An Post&quot; extend east to take in the lands to the west of Clonkeen Road, Deansgrange Cemetery as far as Newtownpark Avenue. The N11 road runs through the area, as does a small stream.

Foxrock borders the suburbs of Carrickmines, Cornelscourt, Deansgrange and Leopardstown.

==Education==
Foxrock has a number of primary schools, and one secondary school for girls only, Loreto Convent, Foxrock. Hollypark Boys and Girls primary schools also service the area.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Foxrock was formerly served by the Harcourt Street railway line from central Dublin&#x27;s Harcourt Street to Bray. A temporary platform opened in 1859 followed by a more permanent station in August 1861, finally closing in January 1959.

Foxrock is bypassed by the Luas Green Line light rail system which deviates from the old railway line. The nearest Luas stop to Foxrock is Carrickmines, which is where the Green Line rejoins the old railway route. Sandyford and Central Park are also considered local stops within proximity to Foxrock. There is another stop before Carrickmines for the racecourse, but as of 2010, this had yet to open.

===Bus===
Dublin Bus high-frequency services 145 and 155 and the rush-hour only 84X link Foxrock Church with the City Centre. The Aircoach Greystones service to Dublin Airport stops at Foxrock’s Roman Catholic church en route to the airport. Go-Ahead route 63A serves Foxrock village once a day in each direction on weekdays.

==People==

<text>Fruit sours is a confectionery that is normally sold in bulk. Each piece is spherical and about 15mm in diameter. They come in a variety of colors; typically red (strawberry), orange, yellow (lemon), green (apple or lime), and purple (berry or black currant). Fruit sours are comparable to jelly beans in texture, with a soft candy center and a glazed outer shell. They are also mildly tart and tangy in flavor, due to citric acid and malic acid which are sometimes crystals that coat the sweets. Gourmet varieties will have a more prominent fruit-flavoring added.

A 4 oz. serving of fruit sours contains about 400 calories with 105 grams of carbohydrates.

He born at Hampton Court Green on 29 September 1818, was third son of Hugh Blaydes (1777–1829) of High Paull, Yorkshire, and of Ranby Hall, Nottinghamshire, J.P. and high sheriff for the latter county; his mother was Delia Maria, second daughter of Colonel Richard Wood of Hollin Hall, Yorkshire. James Blaides of Hull, who married on 25 March 1615 Anne, sister of the poet Andrew Marvell, was a direct ancestor.
After his father&#x27;s death in 1829, Blaydes was sent to a private school at Boulogne, and then, on 14 September 1831, to St. Peter&#x27;s School, York, where he became a free scholar in June 1832 and gained an exhibition before matriculating at Oxford, 20 October 1836, as a commoner of Christ Church. John Ruskin, about five months his junior, was already a gentleman commoner there, and Thomas Gaisford was dean. 
In 1838, Blaydes was elected Hertford scholar and was a student of Christ Church, and in Easter term 1840 was placed in the second class in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; along with George Webbe Dasent and James Anthony Froude. He graduated B.A. in 1840, proceeding M.A. in 1843.
After a long tour through France and Italy in 1840-1, finally spending a week in Athens, he returned to Oxford in August 1841, and issued an edition of Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Birds&quot; (1842), with short Latin notes. 
He was ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in 1843, he accepted the college living of Harringworth, Northamptonshire. 
Harringworth was Blaydes&#x27; home for forty-three years (1843–1886). 
A staunch &#x27;Protestant,&#x27; he joined on 10 December 1850 the deputation from his university which, headed by the Chancellor, the Duke of Wellington, presented an address to Queen Victoria against the &#x27;papal aggression&#x27;.
But Blaydes&#x27; interest and ample leisure were mainly absorbed by classical study. 
In 1845, he published an edition of a second play of Aristophanes the &quot;Acharnians.&quot; 
In 1859, he published in the &quot;Bibliotheca classica&quot; three plays of Sophocles. 
The reception of the book was not altogether favourable, and a difference with the publishers led him to issue separately the four remaining plays with Williams &amp; Norgate. 
He reckoned that he gave more than twenty years to Sophocles, and, with intervals, more than fifty to Aristophanes.
Blaydes resigned his benefice in 1884, and from 1886 lived at Brighton. 
In 1907, he moved to Southsea, where he died, retaining his vigour till near the end, on 7 September 1908; he was buried in Brighton Cemetery.

==Family==
Blaydes married first, in 1843, Fanny Maria Page-Turner, one of the co-heiresses of Sir Edward George Thomas Page-Turner, of Ambrosden, Oxfordshire, and Battlesden, Bedfordshire; she was killed in a carriage accident, 21 August 1884, leaving three sons and four daughters. 
Blaydes&#x27; second wife was Emma Nichols.

<doc id="1139027" wikidata="Q17143919" url="?curid=1139027" title="The Veil (American TV series)">
<text>The Veil is an American horror/supernatural anthology television series hosted by and starring Boris Karloff and produced in 1958 by Hal Roach Studios, very similar to &quot;Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond&quot;. The series was created by Frank P. Bibas (1917-1997).

Production was abandoned after a pilot and ten episodes had been made, which were never broadcast nor shown in syndication. However the episodes were later compiled into three feature-length films which were broadcast on late night TV in the 1960s and later released to VHS home video.

The complete original series has since been released in its original format on DVD from Shout! Factory / Timeless Media retitled &quot;Tales of the Unexplained&quot;.

==Production==
The series was hosted by Karloff, who also acted in every episode but one (“Jack the Ripper”). Episode plots supposedly were based upon real-life reports of supernatural happenings and the unexplained. Ten of the 12 episodes begin and end with Karloff standing in front of a roaring Gothic fireplace and inviting viewers to find out what lies &quot;behind the veil&quot;. Karloff began each episode with the following line: &quot;Good evening. Tonight I&#x27;m going to tell you another strange and unusual story of the unexplainable which lies behind The Veil.&quot;

Guest stars (aside from Karloff) included Whit Bissell, George Hamilton, Myron Healy, Patrick Macnee, Morris Ankrum, Denise Alexander, Torin Thatcher, Niall MacGinnis and others. Directors included Herbert L. Strock, Frank P. Bibas, Paul Landres, Arthur Hiller and George Waggner.

Hailed by critics as &quot;the greatest television series never seen&quot; (according to DVD release publicity), &quot;The Veil&quot; was never broadcast. Troubles within the Hal Roach studio (and the collapse of a preliminary co-production arrangement with National Telefilm Associates) resulted in production being cancelled after only a pilot and 10 episodes were produced. Hal Roach purchased an additional episode called “Jack the Ripper” from a British TV studio in an attempt to fill out the series a bit, but the number of episodes was still considered too small to justify sale to a network or to syndication. (The &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; episode was directed separately in England by David MacDonald.)

In the late 1960s, ten of the episodes were combined to form 3 different feature-length anthology films that aired on late night television. The three films were as follows:

*The Veil (features 3 episodes): &quot;Vision in Crime&quot;, &quot;The Doctors&quot;, and &quot;The Crystal Ball&quot;
*Jack the Ripper (features 4 episodes): &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, &quot;Food on the Table&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;Summer Heat&quot;
*Destination Nightmare (features 3 episodes): &quot;Destination Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Girl on the Road&quot; and &quot;The Return of Madame Vernoy&quot;

For many years, it was thought that only those 10 episodes of &quot;The Veil&quot; had been produced, and that two extra titles that were cited in reference sources (&quot;The Vestris&quot; and &quot;Whatever Happened to Peggy?&quot;) were just &quot;alternate titles&quot;. &quot;The Vestris&quot; was a backdoor pilot for &quot;The Veil&quot; which aired separately as a 1958 episode of ABC-TV&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Telephone Time&quot; and thus was the only episode ever aired. “Whatever Happened to Peggy?” disappeared from all of the later VHS video compilations.

Those same ten episodes were only released on VHS home video in their original format for the first time in the 1990s, and were subsequently released on DVD by Something Weird Video. These collections included neither the pilot (“The Vestris”) nor “Whatever Happened to Peggy?”.

However, in 2008, Timeless Media Group released a two-DVD set of &quot;The Veil&quot;, retitled &quot;Tales of the Unexplained&quot;, which included &quot;The Vestris&quot; and &quot;…Peggy&quot; for a total of 12 episodes. Any DVD sets that are entitled &quot;The Veil&quot; however do not include those two episodes.

In 1999, &quot;Lifting the Veil of Mystery&quot;, a Tom Weaver article on the making of the series (complete with episode guide), appeared in issue #29 of &quot;Cult Movies&quot; magazine. It was later expanded into the book &quot;Scripts from the Crypt: The Veil&quot; (BearManor, 2017) which featured the series&#x27; history, scripts of several episodes, interviews with some of the participants, and a chapter on Boris Karloff&#x27;s career as a TV anthology host. Contributors included Tom Weaver, Dr. Robert J. Kiss, and Barbara Bibas Montero, the daughter of the series&#x27; creator-producer, Frank Bibas.

All episodes other than the pilot have aired in New Zealand on Tubi.

==Episodes==
There are a total of 12 episodes in the series. There is no actual airing order, since only the pilot actually aired. (All episodes star Boris Karloff except for &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; and all episodes hosted by Boris Karloff except for &quot;The Vestris&quot; which was hosted by Frank Baxter)
==Trivia==

* The only episode in which Karloff does not appear as a character in the story, as well as serving as the host, is &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;; this episode was produced by a studio in England and was purchased by Hal Roach Studios to become the 12th episode. 
* Karloff&#x27;s introductions for the episodes &quot;Destination Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Whatever Happened to Peggy?&quot; are set in a study, rather than in front of a fireplace like the others.
* Episodes were screened at the annual Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Aberdeen, Maryland.

<text>KUVO (89.3 MHz) is a non-profit FM radio station broadcasting mainly jazz music in a public radio format. Licensed to Denver, Colorado, KUVO is owned by Rocky Mountain Public Media Inc. KUVO&#x27;s mission is to &quot;provide distinctive music, news and informational programming reflecting the values and cultural diversity of their listener community.&quot;

==History==
In the 1980s Hugo Morales, a radio station executive sought to establish a Hispanic radio station in the Denver area as part of his organization Radio Bilingüe. Florence Hernández-Ramos (born 1950), a graduate of Lamar High School and the University of Colorado at Boulder, helped establish the station. Hernández-Ramos had attended the Colorado School of Law to follow her passion for civil rights. She met Morales while working as a paralegal in the Colorado attorney general&#x27;s office in 1982. Given her law background in civil rights and interest in increasing Hispanic representation, Hernández-Ramos was drawn into Morales’ cause. She conducted research on how such a station could be put on the air and secured the grants necessary to fund it. She also arranged the purchase of the broadcasting and recording equipment, getting the board of directors, and establishing an orientation and training program.

On August 29, 1985, KUVO first signed on. As of its first airing, it was owned and operated by Denver Educational Broadcasting. Since 1994, The station has been broadcasting from the Five Points Media Center at 2900 Welton Street in the Five Points neighborhood of Denver. While it is best known for its jazz format, KUVO remains a Hispanic controlled station and ensures that news, public service announcements, and accomplishments of Hispanic and other local minority communities are shared on air.

On January 16, 2013, it was announced that KUVO would merge into PBS member network Rocky Mountain PBS.

In 2019, KUVO signed a 10-year LMA with the Open Media Foundation to launch Denver Open Media on KUVO-HD3. This partnership includes broadcast of the HD3 signal on K225BS (92.9 FM), an FM translator owned by OMF. Denver Open Media is Denver&#x27;s first all-local station featuring music and shows exclusively from artists in the Denver Metro region.

==Programming==
The station&#x27;s local programming consists primarily of jazz, blues, and Latin jazz music, but it also includes programs devoted to other musical genres such as acid jazz, funk, gospel, rhythm and blues, and salsa. The station also carries selected NPR and other syndicated programs such as: Jazz Night In America, hosted by Christian McBride and WFMT&#x27;s Jazz Network. The station has its own performance studio and on occasion broadcasts live performances and interviews by local and national recording artists.

KUVO broadcasts to 89,200 listeners in the Denver Metro Area each week. After the launch of their mobile app on June 10, 2013, KUVO gained a worldwide listener community. In addition to their local audience, KUVO draws an additional 19,900 listeners from outside the metro area.

KUVO, which commonly refers to itself on-air as &quot;The Oasis in the City,&quot; won the &quot;Major Market Jazz Station of the Year&quot; award in 2005 and 2006 from &quot;JazzWeek&quot; magazine.

==Community engagement==
Since its inception, KUVO has emphasized local partnerships and investing in its community.

KUVO is one of the only radio stations to have its own performance studio. In 2007, they received a grant from Dr. Robert Greer, in memorial of his wife Phyllis A. Greer, to expand the studio into its current iteration. It accommodates an audience of 30 people. Here they host local artists for small live shows, broadcasting on the station, or recording for later distribution. KUVO also partners with high school and collegiate bands and after-school jazz programs throughout the year, giving students a chance to put on shows in front of an audience in the Phyllis A. Greer Performance Studio. Over 3,000 students have performed in the studio.

KUVO also has an ongoing partnership with Dazzle, an independent jazz venue in Denver. Here they host performances for a larger audience.

==Funding==
As a public radio station, KUVO relies on donations for funding and does not broadcast advertising. 63% of the station&#x27;s income comes from individual member pledges and donations. In February 2018, they had more than 7,400 supporting members.

<text>Pyotr Sergeyevich Novikov (; 15 August 1901, Moscow – 9 January 1975, Moscow) was a Soviet mathematician known for his work in group theory. His son, Sergei Novikov, was also a mathematician.

==Early life and education==
Pyotr Sergeyevich Novikov was born on 15 August 1901 in Moscow, Russia to Sergei Novikov, a merchant, and Alexandra Novikov.

He served in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War from 1920 to July 1922. He studied at Moscow University from 1919 to 1920 and again from 1922 until he graduated in 1925. He studied under Nikolai Luzin until he finished his graduate studies in 1929.

==Career==
Novikov worked at the Moscow D. Mendeleev Institute of Chemical Technology from 1929 until 1934, when he joined the Department of Real Function Theory at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. He was awarded his doctorate in 1935 and promoted to full professor in 1939. Novikov became head of the Department of Analysis at the Moscow State Teachers Training Institute in 1944. In 1957, he became the first head of the Department of Mathematical Logic at the Steklov Institute. He jointly held both positions until he retired in 1972 and 1973 respectively.

Sergei Adian and Albert Muchnik were among his students.

==Research==
Novikov is known for his work on combinatorial problems in group theory: the word problem for groups, and his progress in the Burnside problem. In 1955, he proved the Novikov–Boone theorem: that there is a finite presentation of a group for which there is no algorithm which, given two words &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, decides whether &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; describe the same element in the group.

== Awards and honors ==
Novikov was elected a corresponding member and then a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in 1953 and 1960, respectively.

He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1957 for proving the undecidability of the word problem in groups. 

He received the Order of Lenin in 1961 and again in 1971. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. The State Prize of the Russian Federation was awarded to Novikov posthumously in 1999.

==Personal life==
He was married to mathematician Lyudmila Keldysh (1904–1976). Their son Sergei Novikov (1938–2024) became the first Soviet mathematician to receive the Fields Medal.

He died on 9 January 1975 in Moscow.

<doc id="1139037" wikidata="Q921584" url="?curid=1139037" title="Hiroki Azuma">
<text>(born May 9, 1971) is a Japanese cultural critic, novelist, and philosopher. He is the co-founder and former director of Genron, an independent institute in Tokyo, Japan.

==Biography==
Azuma was born in Mitaka, Tokyo. Azuma received his PhD in Culture and Representation from the University of Tokyo in 1999 and became a professor at the International University of Japan in 2003. He was an Executive Research Fellow and Professor at the Center for Global Communications (GLOCOM) and a Research Fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Japan Center. Since 2006, he has been working at the Center for Study of World Civilizations at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

Azuma is married to the writer and poet Hoshio Sanae, and they have one child together. His father-in-law is the translator, novelist, and occasional critic Kotaka Nobumitsu.

==Work==
Hiroki Azuma is one of the most influential young literary critics in Japan, focusing on literature and on the idea of individual liberty.

He began writing inspired by the work of Kojin Karatani and Akira Asada. He is an associate of Takashi Murakami and the Superflat movement. His publishing debut was &quot;Solzhenitsyn Essay&quot; in 1993. Azuma handed the work directly to Karatani during his lecture series at Hosei University which Azuma was auditing.

Azuma launched his career as a literary critic in 1993 with a postmodern style influenced by leading Japanese critics Kojin Karatani and Akira Asada. In the late 1990s, Azuma began examining various pop phenomena, especially the emerging otaku/Internet/video game culture, and became widely known as an advocate of the thoughts of a new generation of Japanese. He is interested in the transformation of the Japanese literary imagination under its current “otaku-ization.”

Azuma has published seven books, including &quot;Sonzaironteki, Yubinteki&quot; (&quot;Ontological, Postal&quot;) in 1998, which focuses on Jacques Derrida&#x27;s oscillation between literature and philosophy. This work won the Suntory Literary Prize in 2000 and made Azuma the youngest writer to ever win that prize. Akira Asada stated that it is one of the best books written in the 90s; however, Hiroo Yamagata pointed out that the book is based on the misunderstanding of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. He also wrote &quot;Dobutsuka-suru Postmodern&quot; (2001, lit, &quot;Animalizing Postmodernity&quot;; translated as &quot;&quot; in 2009), which analyzes Japanese pop culture through a postmodern lens and uses the term &quot;database consumption&quot; to describe a new paradigm of media consumption that consumes elements of a narrative rather than a narrative itself. He has also set up a non-profit organization to encourage cutting-edge critics who might be shut out of the existing publishing world.

<doc id="1139039" wikidata="Q352437" url="?curid=1139039" title="Takashi Murakami">
<text>is a Japanese contemporary artist. He works in fine arts (such as painting and sculpture) as well as commercial media (such as fashion, merchandise, and animation) and is known for blurring the line between high and low arts. His work draws from the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition and the nature of postwar Japanese culture. He has designed covers for several hip hop albums, namely Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Graduation&quot; (2007), Future&#x27;s eponymous fifth studio album (2017), West and Kid Cudi&#x27;s &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot; (2018), and Juice Wrld&#x27;s posthumous &quot;The Party Never Ends&quot; (2024).

Murakami is the founder and President of the art trading company Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd. through which he manages several artists. He was the founder and organizer of the biannual art fair Geisai.

==Life and career==

===Academic background and early career===
Murakami was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. From early on, he was a fan of anime and manga (Japanese cartoons and comics respectively), and hoped to work in the animation industry. He attended Tokyo University of the Arts to acquire the drafting skills necessary to become an animator, but eventually majored in Nihonga, the &#x27;traditional&#x27; style of Japanese painting that incorporates traditional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques and subjects. He earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1988. Though he would go on to earn a Ph.D. in Nihonga (1993), he gradually became disillusioned with its insular, highly political world and started to explore more contemporary artistic styles, media, and strategies.

Murakami was dissatisfied with the state of contemporary art in Japan, believing it to be &quot;a deep appropriation of Western trends.&quot; Thus, much of his early work was done in the spirit of social criticism and satire. On an article naming and explaining all of Murakami&#x27;s pieces lies the infamous &quot;My Lonesome Cowboy&quot;, a companion to his earlier &quot;Hiropon&quot;. The sculpture is that of a naked anime character with blond spiky hair with a spiral trail of semen circling him. This piece is Murakami&#x27;s most expensive piece to date selling for $15,100,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s New York auction in 2008. Efforts from this period include performance art (Osaka Mixer Project, 1992), parodies of the &quot;message&quot; art popular in Japan in the early &#x27;90s, (Dobozite Dobozite Oshamanbe, 1993), and conceptual works (e.g. Randoseru Project, 1991). He also began developing his own pop icon, &quot;Mr. DOB&quot;, which would later develop into a form of self-portraiture, the first of several endlessly morphing and recurring motifs seen throughout his work. Though he garnered attention, many of his early pieces were not initially well received in Japan.

===New York===
In 1994, Murakami received a fellowship from the Asian Cultural Council and participated in the PS1 International Studio Program in New York City for a year. During his stay, he was exposed to and highly inspired by Western contemporary artists such as Anselm Kiefer and especially the simulationism of artists such as Jeff Koons. He established a small studio, which, together with the Hiropon Factory in Japan, became the precursor to his company Kaikai Kiki. After returning to Japan, he would develop the core concepts behind his artistic practice and begin exhibiting regularly at major galleries and institutions across Europe and America.

===Superflat===
In 2000, Murakami published his &quot;Superflat&quot; theory in the catalogue for a group exhibition of the same name that he curated for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. The theory posits that there is a legacy of flat, 2-dimensional imagery from Japanese art history in manga and anime. This style differentiates itself from the western approach in its emphasis on surface and use of flat planes of color. Superflat also served as a commentary on postwar Japanese society in which, Murakami argues, differences in social class and popular taste have &#x27;flattened,&#x27; producing a culture with little distinction between &#x27;high&#x27; and &#x27;low&#x27;. The theory provided the context for his work and he elaborated on it with the exhibitions &quot;Coloriage&quot; (2002, Fondation Cartier pour l&#x27;art contemporain, Paris) and &quot;Little Boy: The Arts of Japan&#x27;s Exploding Subculture&quot; (2005, Japan Society, New York), which was named after Little Boy. These helped introduce Japan&#x27;s lesser-known creative culture overseas and such curatorial projects would become an integral part of Murakami&#x27;s multifaceted artistic practice. In the past decade, Murakami&#x27;s curatorship expanded to include &quot;Kazunori Hamana, Yuji Uedaa, and Otani Workshop&quot; at Blum &amp; Poe, New York (2016) and &quot;Juxtapox x Superflat&quot; at Vancouver Art Gallery (2016).

In accordance with the Superflat concept, Murakami&#x27;s practice involves repackaging elements usually considered &quot;low&quot; or subcultural and presenting them in the &quot;high-art&quot; market. He then further flattens the playing field by repackaging his &quot;high-art&quot; works as merchandise, such as plush toys and T-shirts, making them available at more affordable prices.

===Factory===

In 1996, Murakami launched the Hiropon Factory, his production workshop, in order to work on a larger scale and in a more diverse array of media. His model inherits the atelier system which has long existed in Japanese painting, printmaking and sculpture and is common to anime and manga enterprises, such as Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s Studio Ghibli. In 2001, Hiropon Factory was incorporated as Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd.

===Collaborations===
In 2002, at the invitation of designer Marc Jacobs, Murakami began his long-lasting collaboration with the fashion brand Louis Vuitton. He began by contributing artwork which was used in the design of a series of handbags. The series re-envisioned the company&#x27;s monogram and was a huge commercial success. Though he had previously collaborated with fashion designers such as Issey Miyake Men by Naoki Takizawa, his work with Louis Vuitton made him widely known for blurring the line between &#x27;high art&#x27; and commercialism. It also elevated him to celebrity status in his home country of Japan.

In 2007, Murakami provided the cover artwork for rapper Kanye West&#x27;s album &quot;Graduation&quot; and directed an animated music video for West&#x27;s song &quot;Good Morning.&quot; He also provided cover artwork for West&#x27;s 2018 collaboration album &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot; with Kid Cudi.

For &quot;Graduation&quot; and &quot;Good Morning&quot;, Murakami would later &#x27;re-appropriate&#x27; these projects by incorporating their imagery into his paintings and sculptures, further blurring the boundaries between art and commercial branding and even questioning the existence of such a boundary.

Asked about straddling the line between art and commercial products, Murakami responded:

I don&#x27;t think of it as straddling. I think of it as changing the line. What I&#x27;ve been talking about for years is how in Japan, that line is less defined. Both by the culture and by the post-War economic situation. Japanese people accept that art and commerce will be blended; and in fact, they are surprised by the rigid and pretentious Western hierarchy of &quot;high art.&quot; In the West, it certainly is dangerous to blend the two because people will throw all sorts of stones. But that&#x27;s okay—I&#x27;m ready with my hard hat.

Murakami has also collaborated with a wide range of creators and industries in Japan, a prominent example being the image characters he created for the press relations campaign of the major urban real estate development Roppongi Hills.

In 2009, music producer Pharrell Williams unveiled a collaborative sculpture with Murakami at Art Basel, which Williams stated &quot;illustrates the metaphor of value.&quot;

Murakami and McG directed short &quot;Akihabara Majokko Princess&quot;, where Kirsten Dunst sings a cover of The Vapors&#x27; 1980 song &quot;Turning Japanese&quot;. This was shown at the &quot;Pop Life&quot; exhibition in London&#x27;s Tate Modern museum from October 1, 2009, to January 17, 2010. It shows Dunst dancing around Akihabara, a shopping district in Tokyo, Japan.

In May 2014, with Pharrell and Kz of livetune, Murakami created a music video for the remix of the Hatsune Miku song &quot;Last Night, Good Night (Re:Dialed)&quot;. The team was assembled by the YouTube channel The Creators Project, headed by Vice and Intel. The same year, Murakami&#x27;s anime-inspired illustrations from his first film &quot;Jellyfish Eyes,&quot; also adorned a T-shirt by Billionaire Boys Club, the brand co-founded by Pharrell and Nigo.

In Fall of 2015, Takashi collaborated with Vans. The name of this collaboration was Vault By Vans x Takashi Murakami Collection. His artwork was on Vans classic slip on, apparel and skateboard decks for an illuminated time and only in selected stores. His artwork mostly consisted of his famous skull and flower designs.  

In 2018, Takashi Murakami collaborated with fashion designer Virgil Abloh on a series of artworks, bringing the fashion world to the art world but ultimately transcending both to create something more. Takashi and Virgil discuss their careers and their collaboration at length in their interview for Cultured Magazine&#x27;s fall 2018 issue where they are featured on the cover.

In March 2019, Billie Eilish released one of two official music videos for &quot;You Should See Me in a Crown&quot;, one being directed and animated by Takashi Murakami. Murakami stated in a press release that the anime-style video, which was animated using motion capture technology, took eight months for him to create. The video opens with an animated version of Eilish, dressed in a neon-green shirt and shorts, eventually morphing into a spider-like monster that wreaks havoc on a miniature city. The video features the &quot;Blohsh&quot;, Eilish&#x27;s signature logo, as well as Murakami&#x27;s flowers. The late rapper Juice WRLD approached Murakami to do a project several weeks before his untimely death, as a result of which, the projected could never be completed.

In March 2020, J Balvin released his album &quot;Colores&quot; featuring album cover designs and artwork by Takashi Murakami. The Murakami-designed artwork was carried over to merchandise to celebrate the release of his album.

In April 2020, Supreme released a Box Logo Tee featuring artwork from Murakami. All the proceeds went to HELP USA, in order to support youth and families facing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, Murakami collaborated with Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton on the his &quot;+44&quot; fashion range. Murakami also designed his helmet for that year&#x27;s .

In June 2024, Murakami collaborated with k-pop group NewJeans to create exclusive merchandise and album designs for their Japanese debut single &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

In November 2024, Murakami designed the album cover for Juice WRLD&#x27;s final posthumous studio album &quot;The Party Never Ends&quot;, and a limited-time loading screen for his collaboration in Fortnite.

===Current===

From 2007 to 2009, Murakami&#x27;s first retrospective ©Murakami traveled from the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles (its multi-disciplinary approach to contemporary art), to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York, the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, and lastly the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain. Sarah Thornton tracks the early stages of the exhibition&#x27;s planning, including in-depth curatorial meetings between Murakami and prominent museum figures, in &quot;Seven Days in the Art World&quot;. The exhibition earned widespread attention for, among other things, including a fully functioning Louis Vuitton boutique as one of the exhibits.

In 2008, Murakami was named one of Time magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People&quot;, the only visual artist included.

In September 2010 Murakami became the third contemporary artist, and first Japanese, to exhibit at the Palace of Versailles in France, filling 15 rooms and the park with his sculptures, paintings, a decorative carpet, and lamps.

On June 21, 2011, Google featured a doodle tagged as &quot;First Day of Summer&quot; which was created by Murakami. This was accompanied by a Winter Solstice doodle for the Southern Hemisphere.

In February 2012, Murakami opened an exhibition in Doha, Qatar. Titled Murakami-Ego, this showed around 60 old works alongside new ones designed especially for the exhibition. Among the new ones, a 100-metre long wall painting depicting the suffering of the Japanese people after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

In March 2013, livetune released a PV, directed by Murakami, for Redial, featuring Hatsune Miku.

In April 2013, Murakami&#x27;s first feature film was released in theaters across Japan. &quot;Jellyfish Eyes&quot; (originally titled &quot;Me me me no kurage)) is a live-action movie featuring CGI characters designed by Murakami called Friend.

In 2019, Murakami was working on his own album of original folk songs, inspired by Japanese group Happy End.

In December 2024, the largest private collection of Murakami prints was displayed in the exhibition &quot;Tokyo Calling&quot; at Guy Hepner, New York which featured over 30 original prints and explored the artist&#x27;s superflat style.

==Technique==

Murakami&#x27;s art encompasses a wide range of media and is generally described as superflat. It has been noted for its use of color, incorporation of motifs from Japanese traditional and popular culture, flat/glossy surfaces, and content that could be described at once as &quot;cute&quot;, &quot;psychedelic&quot;, or &quot;satirical&quot;. Among his best known recurring motifs are smiling flowers, Mr. DOB, mushrooms, skulls, Buddhist iconography, and the sexual complexes of otaku culture. One of Murakami&#x27;s most famous pieces known as &#x27;Hiropon&#x27; brings to light his embrace of otaku culture. The sculpture that was created in 2001 is said to show the &quot;otaku culture and its strange, shocking sexuality in full force&quot;. The concept of the smiling flowers was revealed in an interview to be &quot;evoked repressed, contradictory emotions and collective trauma of Japanese locals triggered by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings back in 1945.&quot; In addition to large paintings such as 727 (permanent collection Museum of Modern Art, New York) and Tan Tan Bo Puking – a.k.a. Gero Tan, he has also produced sculptures, balloons, &#x27;all-over&#x27; wallpaper installations, animated works, prints, posters, and assorted merchandise.

===Strategic approach===
Murakami has expressed since early on a frustration with the lack of a reliable and sustainable art market in postwar Japan. Largely for this reason, he formulated a strategy wherein he would first establish himself in the Western art world and then import himself back to Japan, building a new type of art market in the process. In order to create something rooted in his own Japanese culture and history but still fresh and valid internationally, he began searching for something that could be considered &#x27;uniquely Japanese.&#x27; After concluding that elements of &#x27;high&#x27; art were confounding at best, he began to focus on Japan&#x27;s &#x27;low&#x27; culture, especially anime and manga, and the larger subculture of otaku. His artistic style and motifs (cute [kawaii]/disturbing anime-esque characters rendered in bright colors, flat and highly glossy surfaces, life-size sculptures of anime figurines) derived from this strategy. This is demonstrated in his whimsical &quot;Cosmos Ball&quot; from 2000, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art.

===Market value===
On November 11, 2003, &quot;ARTnews&quot; has described Murakami&#x27;s work as being in great demand. &quot;Hiropon&quot; (1997), satirical sculpture, standing a bit over 7 feet tall, of an anime character with oversized lactating breasts whose milk stream forms a jump rope made of fiberglass, sold for $427,500 at Christie&#x27;s auction house in May 2002. &quot;Miss ko2&quot; (1996), a 6-foot-tall model of an anime-inspired blonde girl in a red and white maid outfit, was sold for $567,500 in 2003, and was put up for auction in 2010, where it sold for 22.9 million HKD. In May 2008, &quot;My Lonesome Cowboy&quot; (1998), an anime-inspired sculpture of a masturbating boy whose semen stream forms a lasso, sold for $15.2 million at Sotheby&#x27;s, making it his most highly valued piece. Murakami&#x27;s current net-worth is estimated to be around US$100 million, and the value of his works continue to rise in today&#x27;s market.

==Kaikai Kiki==
Murakami has incorporated his operations as Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd. in Japan (2001), Kaikai Kiki New York, LLC in New York (2001), and Kaikai Kiki LA, LLC in Los Angeles (2010). The name &quot;Kaikai Kiki&quot; (カイカイキキ) which means &quot;brave, strong and sensitive&quot;, was borrowed from a critic in the late 17th century who used it to describe the paintings of Eitoku Kano.

Kaikai Kiki executes Murakami&#x27;s wide range of artistic endeavors and consists of both offices and production studios. In addition to handling the production and promotion of Murakami&#x27;s artwork and projects, the company manages the careers of young artists, organizes international art projects, produces and promotes merchandise, and handles the organization and operation of the Geisai art fair.

Having earned success and recognition internationally, Murakami has devoted himself to nurturing and supporting the careers of a younger generation of Japanese artists. Likening the operation to that of a record label, he offers both logistic support and practical career advice. Through this endeavor, he also seeks to build an original and sustainable art market in Japan.

In 2008, Kaikai Kiki converted the basement space beneath its Tokyo office into an art gallery. Kaikai Kiki Gallery has held exhibitions not only for the artists under its management but also international names such as Mark Grotjahn and Friedrich Kunath. All exhibitions are curated by Murakami.

A second Gallery called Hidari Zingaro was opened in 2010 and has now expanded to include four separate locations within the Nakano Broadway shopping mall in Nakano, Tokyo.

The company and its galleries represent a number of prominent international artists including Takashi Murakami, KAWS, Mark Grotjahn, Anselm Reyle, Matthew Monahan, Seonna Hong, Aya Takano, Chiho Aoshima, ob, Mr., Fantasista Utamaro, Virgil Abloh, Michael Rikio Ming Hee Ho, Kazumi Nakamura, Otani Workshop, Yūji Ueda, Chinatsu Ban, Rei Sato, and Friedrich Kunath. The company began in Saitama, Japan in Asaka City, and now has offices in Tokyo, Japan in the Moto-Azabu neighborhood and New York as well as affiliates in Berlin and Taiwan.

==Geisai==

From 2002 until 2014, Murakami organized a unique direct-participatory art fair called Geisai. It was held once per year in Japan and once per year in a different city, such as Taipei, or Miami. Rather than give space to pre-screened galleries, the fair allowed artists to create their own booths and interact directly with potential buyers.

==NFTs==
Murakami was involved in NFTs from April 2021 but his first project, &quot;Murakami.Flowers&quot;, was suspended by the artist shortly after its release due to his concern about his little knowledge of the topic. The idea of creating NFTs stemmed from his financial problems during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2021 he collaborated with Nike-owned company RTFKT Studios on CloneX avatar projects. In January 2022 he announced resuming work on &quot;Murakami.Flowers&quot;.

<text>SMS &quot;Szent István (His Majesty&#x27;s Ship &quot;Saint Stephen) was the last of four dreadnought battleships built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. &quot;Szent István&quot; was the only ship of her class to be built within the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a concession made to the Hungarian government in return for its support for the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets which funded the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class. She was built at the Ganz-Danubius shipyard in Fiume, where she was laid down in January 1912. She was launched two years later in 1914, but &quot;Szent István&quot;″s construction was delayed due to the smaller shipyards in Fiume, and further delayed by the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. She was finally commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in December 1915.

Armed with a main battery of twelve guns in four triple turrets, &quot;Szent István&quot; was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy upon her commissioning. Alongside the other ships of her class, she was stationed out of the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola. &quot;Szent István&quot;″s commissioning into the fleet came too late for her to participate in the Bombardment of Ancona following Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915, and she saw little combat for the rest of the war due to the Otranto Barrage, which prevented the Austro-Hungarian Navy from leaving the Adriatic Sea.

In June 1918, in a bid to ensure safer passage for German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats through the Strait of Otranto, the Austro-Hungarian Navy attempted to break the Barrage. This attack was to be spearheaded by all four ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class but was abandoned after &quot;Szent István&quot; and her sister ship, , were attacked by Italian motor torpedo boats on the morning of 10 June. While &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; was unharmed, &quot;Szent István&quot; was struck by two torpedoes launched from &quot;MAS-15&quot;, and capsized roughly three hours later off the island of Premuda. She is the only battleship whose sinking was filmed during World War I.

The ship&#x27;s wreck was located in the mid-1970s by the Yugoslav Navy. She lies upside down at a depth of . Her bow broke off when it hit the seabed while the stern was still afloat, but is immediately adjacent to the rest of the heavily encrusted hull.

Before the construction of &quot;Szent István&quot; and the other three ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, most of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s battleships had been designed for the defense of the Empire&#x27;s coastline. During the 19th-century, sea power had not been a priority in Austrian foreign policy. As a result, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had little public interest or support. However, the appointment of Archduke Franz Ferdinand – heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne and a prominent and influential supporter of naval expansion – to the position of admiral in September 1902 greatly increased the importance of the Navy in the eyes of both the general public and the Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments. Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s interest in naval affairs were largely motivated from his belief that a strong navy would be necessary to compete with Italy, which he viewed as Austria-Hungary&#x27;s greatest regional threat.

In 1904, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began an expansion program intended to equal that of the other Great Powers of Europe. This naval expansion program coincided with the establishment of the Austrian Naval League in September 1904 and the appointment of Vice-Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli to the posts of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (German: &quot;Marinekommandant&quot;) and Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: &quot;Chef der Marinesektion&quot;) in October that same year. After Montecuccoli&#x27;s appointment, the Admiral worked to pursue the efforts championed by his predecessor, Admiral Hermann von Spaun, and pushed for a greatly expanded and modernized navy.

The origins of &quot;Szent István&quot; and the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class can also be found in developments in the first decade of the 20th century which greatly increased the importance of sea power to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between 1906 and 1907, railroads linking Trieste and the Dalmatian coastline to the interior of the Empire had been constructed through Austria&#x27;s Alpine passes. Additionally, lower tariffs on the port of Trieste allowed for a rapid expansion of the city and a similar growth in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s merchant marine. As Austria-Hungary became more connected to naval affairs than in past decades, a new line of battleships would be necessary to match the Empire&#x27;s growing naval interests.

&quot;Szent István&quot; and her sister ships were first envisioned in the middle of a heated naval arms race between Austria-Hungary and its nominal ally, Italy. Since the Battle of Lissa in 1866, Italy&#x27;s Regia Marina was considered the most-important naval power in the region which Austria-Hungary measured itself against, often unfavorably. The disparity between the Austro-Hungarian and Italian navies had existed since the unification of Italy; in the late 1880s Italy had the third-largest fleet in the world, behind the French Republic&#x27;s Navy and the British Royal Navy. While the disparity between Italian and Austro-Hungarian naval strength had been somewhat equalized with the Russian Imperial Navy and the German Kaiserliche Marine surpassing the Italian Navy in 1893 and in 1894, Italy had once again regained the initiative by the turn of the century. In 1903, the year before Montecuccoli&#x27;s appointment, Italy had 18 battleships in commission or under construction compared to 6 Austro-Hungarian battleships.

Following the construction of the final two s in 1903, the Italian Navy elected to construct a series of large cruisers rather than additional battleships. Furthermore, a major scandal involving the Terni steel works&#x27; armor contracts led to a government investigation that postponed several naval construction programs for three years. These delays meant that the Italian Navy would not initiate construction of another battleship until 1909, and provided the Austro-Hungarian Navy an opportunity to even the disparity between the two fleets. The construction of &quot;Szent István&quot; and her sister ships can thus be viewed in the context of the naval rivalry between Austria-Hungary and Italy, with the ship playing a role in a larger attempt by Austria-Hungary to compete with Italy&#x27;s naval power.

=== Austro-Italian naval arms race ===
The revolution in naval technology created by the launch of the British in 1906 and the Anglo-German naval arms race that followed had a tremendous impact on the development of future battleships around the world, including &quot;Szent István&quot;. &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, armed with ten large-caliber guns, was the first of a revolutionary new standard of &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleships that rendered pre-dreadnought battleships obsolete. As a result, the value of older battleships declined rapidly in the years after 1906. This development gave Austria-Hungary the opportunity to make up for neglecting its navy in past years. Furthermore, Austria-Hungary&#x27;s improved financial situation following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 were beginning to reflect in the form of larger budgets being allocated to the Empire&#x27;s armed forces. Political will also existed to construct Austria-Hungary&#x27;s own dreadnought battleship, as both Archduke Ferdinand and Admiral Montecuccoli were supportive of constructing a new class of modern battleships. As a result, by 1908 the stage was set for the creation of &quot;Szent István&quot; and the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class.

Shortly after assuming command as Chief of the Navy, Montecuccoli drafted his first proposal for a modern Austrian fleet in the spring of 1905. While these plans were ambitious and included 12 battleships, none of the ships were near the eventual size of &quot;Szent István&quot;. Additional proposals came from outside the Naval Section of the War Ministry. Two proposals from Slovenian politician Ivan Šusteršič, and the Austrian Naval League in 1905 and 1909 included battleships which approached the size of &quot;Szent István&quot;. While Šusteršič&#x27;s plan lacked the large-caliber guns that would later be found on &quot;Szent István&quot;, the plans submitted by the Austrian Naval League three dreadnoughts of , similar to &quot;Szent István&quot;″s eventual displacement of . These plans were justified by the League by pointing out that newer battleships were necessary to protect Austria-Hungary&#x27;s growing merchant marine, and that Italian naval spending was twice that of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s.

Following the construction of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s last class of pre-dreadnought battleships, the , Montecuccoli submitted a proposal which would include the first design for &quot;Szent István&quot;. With the threat of war with Italy from the Bosnian Crisis in 1908 fresh in the minds of the Austro-Hungarian military, Montecuccoli delivered a memorandum to Emperor Franz Joseph I in January 1909 proposing an enlarged Austro-Hungarian Navy consisting of 16 battleships, 12 cruisers, 24 destroyers, 72 seagoing torpedo boats, and 12 submarines. The most notable change in this memorandum compared to Monteccucoli&#x27;s previous draft from 1905 was the inclusion of four additional dreadnought battleships with a displacement of at load. One of these ships would eventually become &quot;Szent István&quot;.

== Plans and budget ==
Montecuccoli&#x27;s memorandum would eventually be leaked to Italian newspapers just three months after obtaining approval from Emperor Franz Joseph I. The Italian reaction to the Austro-Hungarian plans was swift, and in June 1909, the Italian dreadnought battleship was laid down at the naval shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia.

While &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; was being worked on in Italy, Austria-Hungary&#x27;s own plans for &quot;Szent István&quot; and the other ships of her class remained on paper. Funding necessary to begin construction was not to be had either, due to the collapse of Sándor Wekerle&#x27;s government in Budapest. This left the Hungarian Diet without a prime minister for nearly a year. With no government in Budapest to pass a budget, the money necessary to pay for &quot;Szent István&quot; could not be obtained. As a result, the largest shipbuilding enterprises in Austria-Hungary, the Witkowitz Ironworks and the Škoda Works, offered to begin construction on three &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class dreadnoughts at their own financial risk, in return for assurances that the Austro-Hungarian government would purchase the battleships as soon as funds were available. After negotiations which involved the Austro-Hungarian joint ministries of foreign affairs, war and finance, the offer was agreed to by Montecuccoli, but the number of dreadnoughts constructed under this arrangement was reduced to two. In his memoirs, former Austrian Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff Conrad von Hötzendorf wrote that due to his belief that a war with Italy in the near future was likely, construction on the battleships should begin as soon as possible. He also worked to secure agreements to sell the ships to, in his words, a &quot;reliable ally&quot; (which only Germany could claim to be) should the budget crisis in Budapest fail to be settled quickly.

===Outline===
Although smaller than the contemporary dreadnought and super-dreadnought battleships of the German Kaiserliche Marine and the British Royal Navy, &quot;Szent István&quot; was part of the first class of its type in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. &quot;Szent István&quot; and her sister ships were described by former Austro-Hungarian naval officer Anthony Sokol in his book &quot;The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy&quot; as &quot;excellent ships&quot;, and she was acknowledged as one of the most powerful battleships in the region. The design of the battleship also signaled a change in Austro-Hungarian naval policy, as she was capable of far more than coastal defense or patrolling the Adriatic Sea. Indeed, &quot;Szent István&quot; and her sister ships were so well received that when the time came to plan for the replacement of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s old s, the navy elected to simply take the layout of her class and enlarge them to have a slightly greater tonnage and larger main guns.

===Funding===
The cost to construct &quot;Szent István&quot; was enormous by the standards of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. While the , , and the &quot;Radetzky&quot;-class battleships cost the navy roughly 18, 26, and 40 million krone per ship, &quot;Szent István&quot; was projected to cost over 60 million krone. Under the previous budgets for 1907 and 1908, the navy had been allocated some 63.4 and 73.4 million krone, which at the time was considered an inflated budget due to the construction of two &quot;Radetzky&quot;s. Montecuccoli worried that the general public and the legislatures in Vienna and Budapest would reject the need for a ship as expensive as &quot;Szent István&quot;, especially so soon after the political crisis in Budapest. The dramatic increase in spending meant that in 1909 the navy spent some 100.4 million krone, a huge sum at the time. This was done in order to rush the completion of the &quot;Radetzky&quot;-class battleships, though the looming construction of three other dreadnoughts in addition to &quot;Szent István&quot; meant the Austro-Hungarian Navy would likely have to ask the government for a yearly budget much higher than 100 million krone. A secret agreement to fund construction of &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, &quot;Szent István&quot;″s sister ships, was struck with the Rothschild family in Austria, who owned the Witkowitz Ironworks, the Creditanstalt Bank, and had significant assets in both the Škoda Works and the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. Archduke Franz Ferdinand personally courted Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild to obtain his family&#x27;s monetary support until the government could buy &quot;Szent István&quot;″s two older sister ships.

Facing potential backlash over constitutional concerns that constructing two &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class battleships committed Austria-Hungary to spend roughly 120 million Krone without prior approval by either the Austrian Reichsrat or the Diet of Hungary, the deal remained secret. The agreement was ultimately leaked to the public in April 1910 by the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot;, the newspaper of Austria&#x27;s Social Democratic Party. However, by the time the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; broke the story, the plans had already been finalized on the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class battleship and construction on two of &quot;Szent István&quot;″s sister ships was about to begin.

== General characteristics ==

Designed by naval architect Siegfried Popper, &quot;Szent István&quot; had an overall length of , with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She was designed to displace at load, but at full combat load she displaced . &quot;Szent István&quot;″s hull was built with a double bottom, deep, with a reinforced inner bottom that consisted of two layers of plates.

The hull design was intended by Popper to protect the battleship from naval mines, though it ultimately failed &quot;Szent István&quot; when she was sunk by a torpedo in June 1918. The hull also failed for her sister ship &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; when she was sunk by a mine in November of that same year. &quot;Szent István&quot; also featured two Barr and Stroud optical rangefinder posts on both the starboard and port sides for the secondary guns of the battleship. These rangefinders were equipped with an armored cupola, which housed an Schwarzlose M.07/12 anti-aircraft machine gun. Unlike her sister ships, &quot;Szent István&quot; was not equipped with torpedo nets.

=== Propulsion ===
&quot;Szent István&quot; possessed two shafts and two AEG-Curtis steam turbines, which were housed in a separate engine-room and powered by twelve Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. This differed from the four shaft arrangement present on her three sister ships. &quot;Szent István&quot;″s propulsion system was designed to produce a total of , which was theoretically enough to attain a maximum designed speed of . It was reported during the speed trials of her sister ship &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; that she attained a top speed of , though &quot;Szent István&quot;″s actual top speed is unknown as the official sea trial data and records for all ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class were lost after the war. &quot;Szent István&quot; also carried of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, &quot;Szent István&quot; could steam for at a speed of .

The new Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers of Szent István were 48 tonnes heavier than the older type Yarrow boilers installed on the sister ships, however they were more efficient than the old boilers. The new boilers had a huge advantage of being able to maintain top speed for up to eight hours, compared with only two hours on their sister ships.

=== Armament ===

Constructed at the Škoda Works in Plzeň, Bohemia, &quot;Szent István&quot;″s main battery was one of the few pieces of the battleship to be built outside of Hungary. These guns consisted of twelve 45-calibre Škoda K10 guns mounted in four triple turrets. Two turrets each were mounted forward and aft of the ship&#x27;s main superstructure in a superfiring pair. The implementation of triple turrets aboard &quot;Szent István&quot; came about for two reasons: the need to ensure the ship had a more-compact design and smaller displacement to conform to Austro-Hungarian naval doctrine and budget constraints, and to counter the implementation of triple turrets on the Italian &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;. Having three guns on each turret rather than two made it possible to deliver a heavier broadside than other dreadnoughts of a similar size and meant a shorter citadel and better weight distribution.

&quot;Szent István&quot; carried a secondary armament which consisted of a dozen 50-calibre Škoda K10 guns mounted in casemates amidships. Additionally, eighteen 50-calibre Škoda K10 guns were mounted on open pivot mounts on the upper deck, above the casemates. Three more Škoda K10 guns were mounted on the upper turrets for anti-aircraft duties. Two additional Schwarzlose M.07/12 anti-aircraft machine guns were mounted atop the armored cupolas of her rangefinders. &quot;Szent István&quot; was also equipped with two Škoda G. L/18 landing guns, and two Škoda SFK L/44 S guns for use against small and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and submarines. Furthermore, she also fitted with four submerged torpedo tubes, one each in the bow, the stern, and each side. Complementing these torpedo tubes, &quot;Szent István&quot; usually carried twelve torpedoes.

=== Armor ===
&quot;Szent István&quot; was protected at the waterline with an armor belt which measured thick in the central citadel, where the most-important parts of the ship were located. This armor belt was located between the midpoints of the fore and aft barbettes, and thinned to further towards the bow and stern, but did not reach either. It was continued to the bow by a small patch of armor. The upper armor belt had a maximum thickness of , but it thinned to from the forward barbette all the way to the bow. The casemate armor was also thick.

The sides of the main gun turrets, barbettes, and main conning tower were protected by of armor, except for the turret and conning tower roofs which were thick. The thickness of the decks ranged from in two layers. The underwater protection system consisted of the extension of the double-bottom upwards to the lower edge of the waterline armor belt, with a thin plate acting as the outermost bulkhead. It was backed by a torpedo bulkhead that consisted of two 25-millimetre plates. The total thickness of this system was only which made &quot;Szent István&quot; incapable of containing a torpedo warhead detonation or mine explosion without rupturing. This design flaw would ultimately prove to be fatal for her and her sister ship &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;.

== Construction ==
Montecuccoli&#x27;s plans for the construction of &quot;Szent István&quot; and her sister ships earned the approval of Emperor Franz Joseph I in January 1909, and by April plans for the design, construction, and financing for the battleships had been laid out. For a full year, the Austro-Hungarian Navy attempted to keep the looming construction of the first two battleships a state secret. This did not prevent rumors from circulating across Europe of two dreadnought battleships being constructed in Austria-Hungary. The French Naval Attaché in Vienna complained to Paris in 1910 of extensive secrecy within the Austro-Hungarian Navy, which manifested itself in several ways. Among these were a ban on photography in the Pola, future home port of &quot;Szent István&quot;, and near-constant observation by the Austro-Hungarian police.

The Admiralty considered the rumored construction of the battleships &quot;as a concealed addition to the German fleet&quot;, and interpreted the ships as Austria-Hungary&#x27;s way of repaying Germany for her diplomatic support during the former&#x27;s annexation of Bosnia in 1908. During the spring and summer of 1909, the United Kingdom was locked in a heated naval arms race with Germany which led the Royal Navy to look upon the battleship as a ploy by German Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to outpace British naval construction, rather than the latest development in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s own naval arms race with Italy. The Admiralty&#x27;s concerns regarding the true purpose of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class was so great that a British spy was dispatched to Berlin when Montecuccoli sent an officer from the Naval Section of the War Ministry to obtain recommendations from Tirpitz regarding the design and layout of the battleship. These concerns continued to grow and in April 1909, British Ambassador Fairfax Leighton Cartwright asked Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal about the rumored battleships. Aehrenthal denied the construction of any dreadnoughts, but admitted that plans to construct a new battleship class were being considered. In an attempt to assure Cartwright that Austria-Hungary was not constructing any ships for the German Navy, Aehrenthal justified any naval expansion as being necessary to secure Austria-Hungary&#x27;s strategic interests in the Mediterranean. At the time, the potential that Austria-Hungary was constructing a class of dreadnought battleships was widely regarded among the British press, public, and politicians as a provocation on the part of Germany. Neither the Admiralty&#x27;s suspicions, nor those of some politicians, managed to convince Parliament that the German government was attempting to use the battleships to escalate Germany and Britain&#x27;s already contentious naval arms race however. When Winston Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911, he rejected any potential Austro-German collusion regarding the battleship.

Roughly a year after &quot;Szent István&quot;″s plans were drafted, &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot;, the Austrian Social Democratic Party newspaper, reported the details of the battleship to the general public. The Christian Social Party, supportive of the construction of &quot;Szent István&quot; and her sister ships, and operating on the advice of the navy, published in its own newspaper, &quot;Reichspost&quot;, that the secret project to construct the battleship and the related financial agreements to fund it were true. The &quot;Reichspost&quot; lobbied in support of the project, citing Austria-Hungary&#x27;s national security concerns with an Italian dreadnought already under construction. When the story broke, Archduke Ferdinand also worked to build public support for the construction of the battleships, and the Austrian Naval League did the same.

=== Assembly and commissioning ===

&quot;Szent István&quot; would be the fourth and last ship of her class, was laid down in Fiume by Ganz-Danubius on 29 January 1912. Fiume was the only large Hungarian shipyard in Croatia. Ganz-Danubius had been awarded the contract to build the battleship in return for the Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets which funded the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class. However, this contract involved great expense by the Hungarian government, as Fiume had hitherto only built smaller merchant ships for merchant firms such as the Austrian Lloyd. The shipyards in the city therefore had to be themselves refitted and enlarged for the building of a vessel as large as &quot;Szent István&quot;.

The final package of the budget agreement which funded &quot;Szent István&quot; included provisions which ensured that while the armor and guns of the battleship were to be constructed within Austria, the electrical wiring and equipment aboard &quot;Szent István&quot; was to be assembled in Hungary. Additionally, half of all ammunition and shells for the guns of the ship would be purchased in Austria, while the other half was to be bought in Hungary. Construction on &quot;Szent István&quot; was delayed by the size of Fiume&#x27;s shipyards and as a result, she was not launched until 17 January 1912. It was customary for either the Emperor or his heir to be present at the launching of a major warship, but Emperor Franz Joseph I was too feeble and his heir, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, refused to be there as a consequence of his anti-Hungarian attitudes. Franz Joseph I thus sent a telegram of congratulations which negated the snub offered by his heir. During the launching itself there was an accident when the starboard anchor had to be dropped to prevent the ship from hitting a ship carrying spectators, but the anchor chain had not been shackled to the ship and it struck two dockworkers, killing one and crushing the arm of the other.

Originally referred to as &quot;Battleship VII&quot;, discussion began over what to name the battleship while it was under construction in Trieste. The Naval Section of the War Ministry initially proposed naming the battleship &quot;Hunyadi&quot;. Newspapers within Austria reported during construction that one of the ships was to be named &quot;Kaiser Franz Joseph I&quot;, though it was later revealed the navy had no intentions of renaming the cruiser which already bore the Emperor&#x27;s name. Archduke Franz Ferdinand proposed &quot;Laudon&quot; for the ship in honor of the Austrian field marshal. Emperor Franz Joseph I ultimately decided to name her &quot;Szent István&quot;, after the 11th-century saint Stephen I, the first King of Hungary.

== Career ==

Following France and Britain&#x27;s declarations of war on Austria-Hungary on 11 and 12 August 1914 respectively, the French Admiral Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère was issued orders to close off Austro-Hungarian shipping at the entrance to the Adriatic Sea and to engage any Austro-Hungarian ships his Anglo-French fleet came across. Lapeyrère chose to attack the Austro-Hungarian ships blockading Montenegro. The ensuing Battle of Antivari ended Austria-Hungary&#x27;s blockade, and effectively placed the entrance of the Adriatic Sea firmly in the hands of Britain and France.

Following her launching, &quot;Szent István&quot; underwent sea trials before preparing to be commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the autumn of 1915. &quot;Szent István&quot;″s war logs record that on 18 November 1915, the battleship fired the first trial shots of her guns. Gunnery trials continued the following day and on 20 November, she underwent machinery trials in the Fasana Channel. These machinery trials continued on 22 November, where it was reported that &quot;Szent István&quot; had attained an unofficial speed of . That same day, the battleship conducted torpedo launches from her four torpedo tubes, before anchoring at Fasana for the night. She returned to her home port of Pola on 25 November. Between 13 and 23 December, &quot;Szent István&quot; conducted further gunnery trials before finally being commissioned into the 1st Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.

=== 1916 ===

Like the other three ships of the&quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, &quot;Szent István&quot; saw very little action during the course of the war, spending much of her time at her base at Pola. This general inactivity was partly caused by a fear of mines in the Adriatic. Grand Admiral Anton Johann Haus chose to keep most of his ships in port in order to use the Austro-Hungarian Navy as a fleet in being. This tactic earned sharp criticism from the Austro-Hungarian Army, the German Navy, and the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry, but it also led to a far greater number of Entente naval forces being devoted to the Mediterranean and the Strait of Otranto. These could have been used elsewhere, such as against the Ottoman Empire during the Gallipoli Campaign.

The most-important factor contributing to &quot;Szent István&quot; spending most of her time at port may have been the lack of coal. Prior to the war, the United Kingdom had served as Austria-Hungary&#x27;s primary source for coal. In the years before the war an increasing percentage of coal had come from mines in Germany, Virginia, and from domestic sources, but 75% of the coal purchased for the Austro-Hungarian Navy came from Britain. The outbreak of war meant that these sources, as well as those from Virginia, would no longer be available. Significant quantities of coal had been stockpiled before the war however, ensuring the Navy was capable of sailing out of port if need be. Even so, the necessity of ensuring the Navy&#x27;s most-important ships such as &quot;Szent István&quot; had the coal she needed in the event of an Italian or French attack or a major offensive operation resulted in the dreadnoughts remaining at port unless circumstances necessitated their deployment at sea.

Commissioning into the Austro-Hungarian Navy too late to engage in the Bombardment of Ancona, &quot;Szent István&quot; was mostly relegated to defending Austria-Hungary&#x27;s coastline and of island seaboard for the next three years. The lack of combat engagements, or even instances where &quot;Szent István&quot; left port, is exemplified by war logs. Between 1916 and 1918, the battleship rarely left the safety of the port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fasana Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single two-day trip to Pag Island. In total, only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; and for the rest of the time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. &quot;Szent István&quot; saw so little action and so little time at sea that she was never drydocked to have her bottom cleaned.

===1917===
In January 1917 Emperor Karl I attended a military conference at Schloss Pless with German Kaiser Wilhelm II and members of the German Army and Navy. Haus, along with members of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s naval command at Pola, accompanied the Emperor to this conference in order to discuss naval operations in the Adriatic and Mediterranean for 1917. Days after returning from this conference, Grand Admiral Haus died of pneumonia aboard his flagship &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; on 8 February 1917. Newly crowned Emperor Karl I attended his funeral in Pola.

Despite his death, Haus&#x27; strategy of keeping the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and particularly its dreadnoughts, in port continued. By keeping &quot;Szent István&quot; and the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class battleships as a fleet in being, the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be able to continue to defend its lengthy coastline from naval bombardment or invasion by sea. The major ports of Trieste and Fiume would also remain protected. Furthermore, Italian ships stationed in Venice were effectively trapped by the positioning of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, preventing them from sailing south to join the bulk of the Entente forces at the Otranto Barrage.

Maximilian Njegovan was promoted to admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. With Njegovan appointed to higher office, command of the First Battle Division, which comprised all four &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships, fell to Vice-Admiral Anton Willenik. Njegovan had previously voiced frustration watching the dreadnoughts he had commanded under Haus sit idle at port and upon taking command he had some 400,000 tons of coal at his disposal, but he chose to continue the strategy of his predecessor. Despite a change in command of both the Austro-Hungarian Navy and the Empire which it served, there would be no change in strategy regarding the employment of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class in battle.

Having hardly ever ventured out of port except to conduct gunnery practice for the past two years, the most-significant moments &quot;Szent István&quot; saw while moored in Pola were inspections by dignitaries. The first such visit was conducted by Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916. During this brief visit the Emperor inspected Pola&#x27;s naval establishments and boarded &quot;Szent István&quot;. Karl I returned to Pola in June 1917 in the first formal imperial review of the Austro-Hungarian Navy since 1902. This visit was far grander than his previous trip to the naval base, with officers and sailors crowding the decks of their ships at port and the naval ensign of Austria-Hungary flying from every vessel. The Emperor received multiple cheers and salutes from the men at Pola, who had spent the past two years doing little more than shooting down Italian airplanes and airships. The third dignitary visit came during Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s inspection of Pola&#x27;s German submarine base on 12 December 1917. During this trip, the German Emperor also took the time to inspect &quot;Szent István&quot; in similar fashion to his Austro-Hungarian counterpart. Aside from these visits, the only action the port of Pola and &quot;Szent István&quot; were subject to between the Bombardment of Ancona and the summer of 1918 were the more than eighty air raids conducted by the newly formed Italian Air Force.

===1918 ===

Following the Cattaro Mutiny in February 1918, Admiral Njegovan was fired as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, though at Njegovan&#x27;s request it was announced that he was retiring. Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya, commander of &quot;Szent István&quot;″s sister ship &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, was promoted to rear admiral and named Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet. Horthy&#x27;s promotion was met with support among many members of the naval officer corps, who believed he would use Austria-Hungary&#x27;s navy to engage the enemy. Horthy&#x27;s appointment did however pose difficulties. His relatively young age alienated many of the senior officers, and Austria-Hungary&#x27;s naval traditions included an unspoken rule that no officer could serve at sea under someone of inferior seniority. This meant that the heads of the First and Second Battle Squadrons, as well as the Cruiser Flotilla, all had to go into early retirement. Horthy also used his appointment to take the Austro-Hungarian fleet out of port for maneuvers and gunnery practice on a regular basis. The size of these operations were the largest &quot;Szent István&quot; had ever participated in at the time, and they were the largest the Austro-Hungarian Navy had seen since the outbreak of the war.

These gunnery and maneuver practices were conducted not only to restore order in the wake of several failed mutinies, but also to prepare the fleet for a major offensive operation. Horthy&#x27;s strategic thinking differed from his two predecessors, and shortly after assuming command of the navy he resolved to undertake a major fleet action in order to address low morale and boredom, and make it easier for Austro-Hungarian and German U-boats to break out of the Adriatic into the Mediterranean. After several months of practice, Horthy concluded the fleet was ready for a major offensive at the beginning of June 1918.

==== Otranto Raid ====

Horthy was determined to use the fleet to attack the Otranto Barrage. Planning to repeat his successful raid on the blockade in May 1917, Horthy envisioned a massive attack on the Allied forces with &quot;Szent István&quot; and the other three &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class ships providing the largest component of the assault. They would be accompanied by the three ships of the &quot;Erzherzog Karl&quot;-class pre-dreadnoughts, the three s, the cruiser &quot;Admiral Spaun&quot;, four s, and four torpedo boats. Submarines and aircraft would also be employed in the operation to hunt down enemy ships on the flanks of the fleet.

On 8 June 1918 Horthy took his flagship, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; south with the lead elements of his fleet. On the evening of 9 June, &quot;Szent István&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; followed along with their own escort ships. Horthy&#x27;s plan called for and to engage the Barrage with the support of the &quot;Tátra&quot;-class destroyers. Meanwhile, &quot;Admiral Spaun&quot; and would be escorted by the fleet&#x27;s four torpedo boats to Otranto to bombard Italian air and naval stations. The German and Austro-Hungarian submarines would be sent to Valona and Brindisi to ambush Italian, French, British, and American warships that sailed out to engage the Austro-Hungarian fleet, while seaplanes from Cattaro would provide air support and screen the ships&#x27; advance. The battleships, and in particular &quot;Szent István&quot; and the other &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s, would use their firepower to destroy the Barrage and engage any Allied warships they ran across. Horthy hoped that the inclusion of these ships would prove to be critical in securing a decisive victory.

En route to the harbour at Islana, north of Ragusa, to rendezvous with &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; for the coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage, &quot;Szent István&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; attempted to make maximum speed in order to catch up to the rest of the fleet. In doing so, &quot;Szent István&quot;″s turbines started to overheat and speed had to be reduced to . When an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase to &quot;Szent István&quot; produced an excess of smoke. At about 3:15 am on 10 June, two Italian MAS boats, &quot;MAS-15&quot; and &quot;MAS-21&quot;, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast. The MAS unit was commanded by Capitano di corvetta Luigi Rizzo, who had sunk the Austro-Hungarian coastal defense ship in Trieste six months before. The individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. &quot;MAS-21&quot; attacked &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, but her torpedoes failed to hit the ship. &quot;MAS-15&quot; fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3:25 am at &quot;Szent István&quot;. Both boats evaded any pursuit although &quot;MAS-15&quot; had to discourage the Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat &quot;Tb 76 T&quot; by dropping depth charges in her wake. &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, thinking that the torpedoes were fired by submarines, pulled out of the formation and started to zigzag to throw off any further attacks. She repeatedly fired on suspected submarine periscopes.
&quot;Szent István&quot; was hit by two torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms. The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10° list to starboard. Counterflooding of the portside trim cells and magazines reduced the list to 7°, but efforts to use collision mats to plug the holes failed. While this was going on the dreadnought steered for the nearby Bay of Brgulje at low speed. However, water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side. This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights. The turrets were trained to port in a futile effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard. Upon returning to the formation at 4:45 am, &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; attempted to take &quot;Szent István&quot; in tow, which failed. Many of the crew members of the sinking battleship assembled on the deck to use their weight along with the turned turrets as a counterbalance, but the ship was taking on too much water. &quot;Szent István&quot;″s chaplain performed one final blessing while the crew of &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; emerged onto her decks to salute the sinking ship. At 6:12 am, with the pumps unequal to the task, &quot;Szent István&quot; capsized off Premuda. 89 sailors and officers died in the sinking, 41 of them from Hungary. The low death toll can be partly attributed to the long amount of time it took for the battleship to sink, and the fact that all sailors with the Austro-Hungarian Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service. The captain of &quot;Szent István&quot;, Heinrich Seitz, was prepared to go down with his ship but was saved after being thrown off the bridge when she capsized.

Film footage and photographs exist of &quot;Szent István&quot;″s last half-hour, taken by Linienschiffsleutnant Meusburger of &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; with his own camera and by an official film crew. The two films were later spliced together and exhibited in the United States after the war. The battleship&#x27;s sinking was one of only two on the high seas to ever be filmed, the other being that of the British battleship during World War II. Proceeds from the film of &quot;Szent István&quot; capsizing were eventually used to feed children in Austria following the ending of the war.

Fearing further attacks by torpedo boats or destroyers from the Italian navy, and possible Allied dreadnoughts responding to the scene, Horthy believed the element of surprise had been lost and called off the attack. In reality, the Italian torpedo boats had been on a routine patrol, and Horthy&#x27;s plan had not been betrayed to the Italians as he had feared. The Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed from Pola until 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. Nevertheless, the loss of &quot;Szent István&quot; and the blow to morale it had on the navy forced Horthy to cancel his plans to assault the Otranto Barrage. The fleet returned to the base at Pola where it would remain for the rest of the war.

=== Legacy ===

After the war &quot;MAS-15&quot; was installed in the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II as part of the Museo del Risorgimento in Rome for the torpedo boat&#x27;s role in the sinking of &quot;Szent István&quot;. The anniversary of the sinking, 10 June, has been celebrated by the Regia Marina, and its successor, the Marina Militare, as the official Italian Navy Day ().

The wreck of &quot;Szent István&quot; was located in the mid-1970s by the Yugoslav Navy. She lies upside down at a depth of . Her bow broke off when it hit the seabed while the stern was still afloat, but is immediately adjacent to the rest of the heavily encrusted hull. The two holes from the torpedo hits are visible in the side of the ship as is another deep hole which may be from a torpedo fired at &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; by &quot;MAS 21&quot;. The wreck is a protected site of the Croatian Ministry of Culture.

== Consequences ==
&quot;Konteradmiral&quot; Horthy cancelled the attack because he thought that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.

In fact the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. &quot;Capitano di fregata&quot; Luigi Rizzo was awarded his second Gold Medal of Military Valor; his first was for sinking the pre-dreadnought battleship &quot;Wien&quot; in 1917, and appointed a knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy. After the war &quot;MAS 15&quot; was installed in the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II as part of the Museo del Risorgimento in Rome. The anniversary of the sinking has been celebrated by the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, and its successor, the &quot;Marina Militare&quot;, as its Navy Day ().

<doc id="1139042" wikidata="Q1660586" url="?curid=1139042" title="Arripis">
<text>Arripis is a genus of marine ray-finned fishes from Australia and New Zealand, known as Australian salmon, kahawai and Australian herring. They are the only members of the family Arripidae. Despite the common name, Australian salmon are not related to the salmon family Salmonidae of the Northern Hemisphere, just as Australian herring are not related to herring of the Northern Hemisphere, but belong to the order Scombriformes of mackerel-like fishes. Australian salmon were named so by early European settlers after their superficial resemblance to salmonids.

Relatively long-lived fish, Australian salmon are a favoured target of recreational fishers, and both commercial and traditional Māori fisheries. They are also common bycatch of the Australasian snapper (&quot;Pagrus auratus&quot;), mullet (Mugilidae), white trevally (&quot;Pseudocaranx dentex&quot;), and mackerel (Scombridae) fisheries. These species are all taken in great numbers by way of purse seine nets and trawling. They are also caught by skilled fishermen along the southern coastline of Australia by beach seining.

== Species and range ==
Four recognised species are in this genus. The ranges of the species may overlap to some extent, but can be described as:
== Description ==
A streamlined, fusiform body and large, powerful forked tail – the upper lobe of which is equal to or less than the length of the head in the eastern Australian salmon – are indications of the fast-paced pelagic lives these fish lead. Upon dissection, the extremely large, dense gills (for maximum oxygen extraction) and large proportion of red aerobic muscle in the &#x27;fillets&#x27; is further evidence of a fast-paced pelagic life. The first (spinous, with 9 spines) dorsal fin originates behind the pectoral fins, the former being confluent with, but noticeably higher than the much longer soft dorsal fin (with 15–19 rays), itself much longer than the anal fin (which has three spines and 9–10 soft rays). The pelvic fin is situated in a thoracic position.

Scales and eyes are relatively large – in the Australian herring, the eyes are approximately one-fifth the length of the head in diameter. The large mouth is terminal, and the jaws are lined with bands of sharp villiform (brushlike) teeth. The lateral line runs along the upper sides of the body.

The western Australian salmon is the largest species at a maximum standard length (that is, excluding the caudal fin) and in weight. The Australian herring is the smallest species at maximum fork length (that is, from the snout to the middle of the caudal fin&#x27;s fork) and . Australian salmon share a passing resemblance to the unrelated yellowtail amberjack, (&quot;Seriola lalandi&quot;), locally known as &quot;kingfish&quot;, with which larger Australian salmon are sometimes confused.

All species are strongly countershaded; dorsal colours range from dark blue-green in &quot;A. trutta&quot;, green in &quot;A. georgianus&quot;, and steel-blue to grayish- or greenish-black in &quot;A. truttaceus&quot;; the colours fade to a silver-white ventrally. A smattering of yellow, gray, or blackish spots embellishes the dorsal half, the spots arranged vertically or longitudinally in a series of rows. There are marked differences in subadult coloration: for example, on the flanks of juvenile Australian herring are a series of dark golden vertical bars.

== Reproduction ==
Although their reproduction is poorly studied, Australian salmon are all known to be &quot;pelagic spawners&quot;; that is, they spawn in open water during the austral spring, releasing a large number of tiny (1 mm in diameter), smooth spherical eggs made buoyant by lipid droplets. The eggs (and later the larvae), which possess an unsegmented yolk, become part of the zooplankton, drifting at the mercy of the currents until the larvae develop and settle. The young Australian salmon then spend the first two to five years in sheltered coastal bays, inlets, and estuaries until they become sexually mature and begin to move into more open waters. Relatively long-lived fishes, Australian salmon may attain an age of 26 yr in &quot;Arripis trutta&quot; and 7–9 yr in other species.

All species are oceanic spawners. Reports of &quot;A. trutta&quot; being anadromous and spawning in freshwater are not correct; this may be due to confusion with sea-run specimens of exotic brown trout, (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;), or anadromous populations of native spotted galaxias, (&quot;Galaxias truttaceus&quot;).

&quot;A. georgianus&quot; is thought – due to females retaining both ripe and unripe eggs – to be &quot;partial spawners&quot;; that is, they may spawn over a long period with no real peaks. In contrast, &quot;A. trutta&quot; and &quot;A. truttaceus&quot; are thought to be &quot;serial batch spawners&quot;, completing their spawning season after a series of small &quot;burst&quot; spawnings.

== Ecology ==
All species are neritic and epipelagic, staying within the upper layers of relatively shallow (1–80 m), open and clear coastal waters (although the western Australian salmon may prefer deeper water). The turbulent surf zone of beaches, rocky reefs, bays, and brackish waters such as estuaries are also frequented, and some species may also enter rivers. Juveniles inhabit estuaries and mangroves, as well as sheltered bays with soft bottoms carpeted with seagrasses. Adults undertake seasonal migrations over vast distances, moving into deeper water during winter months. The evolutionary history of the species of &quot;Arripis&quot; has been shaped by changes to oceanographic conditions and land-bridges that occurred during glacial cycles.

Australian salmon form immense schools with hundreds to thousands of individuals, as both adults and juveniles. They are carnivorous and feed primarily on small fish, such as pilchard (Clupeidae); crustaceans such as krill (Euphausiacea), copepods, and other zooplankton (the latter comprising the bulk of the juvenile diets). The zoobenthos is also sampled to some extent, with primarily shellfish, crabs, and annelid worms eaten. The Australian salmon are very fast swimmers, and are sometimes seen mingling with ostensibly similar species of carangids, such as trevally; this is an example of mutualism.

Together with the carangids, Australian salmon feed &quot;en masse&quot; by co-operatively bullying baitfish up to the surface; this herding technique is exploited by seabirds which are quickly attracted to, and feed upon, the foaming mass of fish at the surface. This commensal relationship between the Australian salmon and the birds is noted to be especially strong in such species as the white-fronted tern, (&quot;Sterna striata&quot;), fluttering shearwater, (&quot;Puffinus gavia&quot;), and Buller&#x27;s shearwater, (&quot;Puffinus bulleri&quot;). The baitfish made available by the Australian salmon&#x27;s herding behaviour may also be important to the reproductive success of winter-nesting birds; the decline of the Australians salmon stocks has evoked concern for these bird species, some of which – such as the fairy tern, (&quot;Sterna nereis&quot;) – are endangered

Aside from seabirds, the Australian salmon are also important in the diets of cetaceans, such as killer whales (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) and bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot; &amp; &quot;T. aduncus&quot;); several species of large sharks, for example; great white (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;), dusky (&quot;Carcharhinus obscurus&quot;), copper (&quot;Carcharhinus brachyurus&quot;), and sand tiger (&quot;Carcharias taurus&quot;) sharks; and eared seals such as the Australian sea lion (&quot;Neophoca cinerea&quot;).

==Diet==
&quot;Arripis trutta&quot; is principally a pelagic feeder, which however occasionally feeds from the sea bottom, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to their diet as it appears they feed on those fishes which are locally abundant such as shoals of small fish on which preys. Small kahawai below 100mm in length mainly eat copepods and planktonic crustaceans. This was derived from the analysis of 326 stomachs of the kahawai from Wellington Harbour, which exhibited that the fish is a voracious carnivore which feeds mainly on fishes and to a lesser extent on planktonic crustaceans.

== Importance to humans ==
Australian Salmon contains significant amounts of blood in the fillet and under the skin which if not removed results in a strong flavoured flesh that is unappealing to many consumers. However when bled immediately after capture and filleted properly to remove all traces of blood the resulting flesh is white, neutral flavoured and excellent to eat. What is not sold for human consumption is used as bait for rock lobster (Palinuridae) traps and other commercial and recreational fishing. The Australian salmon fetch no more than a few dollars (AU) per kilogram; nonetheless, large numbers are taken via purse seine nets (and to a lesser extent trawling, hauling, gill, and trap nets) annually; the reported 2002–2003 commercial New Zealand catch of kahawai was 2,900 tonnes. Such reported catches do not include the untold tonnes taken as bycatch from operations targeting more highly valued species. Low-flying planes are used to locate and target sizeable Australian salmon schools, and critics have cited this practice as a means by the industry to artificially inflate catch records (which would give a false impression of abundance). Australian salmon numbers have declined noticeably however, with large specimens becoming ever rarer; the fish have all but disappeared from some areas. On October 1, 2004, the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries included kahawai under its Quota Management System, setting a catch limit of 3,035 tonnes for the season. This was a 5% increase over the previous two years, despite the government&#x27;s intention of lowering catch limits.

In New Zealand, Australian salmon and in particular northern kahawai are highly regarded for their flesh when hot smoked by recreational fisherman, usually using manuka sawdust or woodchips. Australian salmon prepared in this manner are available in many New Zealand supermarkets and fishmongers. The flesh is usually eaten hot, or broken up and used in fish pie.

The Māori of New Zealand, to whom the fish are known by their name &quot;kahawai&quot;, &quot;koopuuhuri&quot;, and &quot;kooukauka&quot;, fish in subsistence and customary capacities. The fish were (and are) caught with lines of flax fibre and elaborate hooks of bone, wood, shell such as paua, or stone. The fish are filleted before being hung on racks to dry. Recreational fishers also seek Australian salmon for their renowned mettle when hooked; the fish are a challenge to land and often jump, occasionally standing on their tails. A significant number are taken for sport. No records of total recreational catches are kept, but the year&#x27;s estimated catch of Australian herring from Western Australia&#x27;s Blackwood River estuary beginning May, 1974, was 68,000 individuals.

Commercial fishing practices undertaken across Australia and New Zealand have been highly criticised in various recreational fishing magazines as being excessive. Many high-profile anglers, such as those on Fishing WA, have made statements that the commercial fish catch in Western Australia and Australia in general is beyond the scope necessary for human and animal consumption, and that they are far more valuable as a recreational fish species. The ease of catching Australian salmon, which tend to form schools of several tonnes, has meant recreational fishers are finding fewer of these species in inshore waters during the season (the migration patterns of Australian salmon mean they come into warmer waters during the autumn).

<text>Hampstead Garden Suburb is a suburb of London, north of Hampstead, west of Highgate and east of Golders Green. It is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations. It is an example of early twentieth-century domestic architecture and town planning in the London Borough of Barnet, northwest London.

The master plan was prepared by Barry Parker and Sir Raymond Unwin. It consists of just over 5,000 properties and is home to around 16,000 people. Undivided houses with individual gardens are a key feature. The area enjoys landscaped garden squares, several communal parks and Hampstead Heath Extension.

Despite its name being Hampstead Garden Suburb, it is not an actual suburb of Hampstead, nor are they in the same London borough, since Hampstead is in the London Borough of Camden, and Hampstead Garden Suburb in the London Borough of Barnet.

==History==
Hampstead Garden Suburb was founded by Henrietta Barnett, who, with her husband Samuel, had started the Whitechapel Art Gallery and Toynbee Hall. In 1906 Barnett set up the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd, which purchased 243 acres of land from Eton College for the scheme and appointed Raymond Unwin as its architect.

Among the aims of the scheme were the following:
* It should cater for all classes of people and all income groups.
* There should be a low housing density.
* Roads should be wide and tree-lined.
* Houses should be separated by hedges, not walls.
* Woods and public gardens should be free to all.
* It should be quiet, with no church bells.

This required a private bill before Parliament, since it was counter to local bylaws. The provisions of the new act, Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906, allowed less land to be taken up by roads and more by gardens and open spaces.

The ideas for the ‘Garden Suburb’ were clearly based on the ideas and experience of Parker and Unwin in the planning and development of Letchworth Garden City, the first development of its kind, inspired by the work of Ebenezer Howard. Other consultant architects involved with the Hampstead development include George Lister Sutcliffe and John Soutar.

However with no industry, no public houses and few shops or services, the suburb, unlike the garden cities, made no attempt to be self-contained. In the 1930s the &quot;Suburb&quot; (as it is known by locals) expanded to north of the A1. Whilst more characterful than most other suburban housing, some of the housing to the north is considered, overall, of less architectural value.
On Central Square, laid out by Sir Edwin Lutyens, there are two large churches, St Jude&#x27;s Church and The Free Church, as well as a Quaker Meeting House. There are two state mixed primary schools in the Suburb, Garden Suburb and Brookland. There is also a girls&#x27; state grammar school, Henrietta Barnett School. The school used to house The Institute, an adult education centre, but The Institute moved first to East Finchley then to Kingsbury and is currently in the process of closing down altogether.

Shops and other services are provided in the shopping parade of Market Place. Shopping areas adjacent to the suburb include Temple Fortune, Golders Green and East Finchley.

Little Wood contains an open-air arena, which is used for summer performances by a local amateur theatre society.

==Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust==
Freehold houses, flats and commercial premises within the Suburb are subject to a scheme of management approved pursuant to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 by an Order of the Chancery Division of the High Court, dated 17 January 1974, as amended by a further Order dated 17 February 1983.

The HGS Trust maintains the character and amenity of the Suburb and is responsible for implementing the management scheme. It has offices in Finchley Road. Freeholders are required to obtain the approval of the trust before altering the external appearance of their properties. Consent is also required for significant changes to gardens, erection of garden sheds and felling or pruning of trees. The trust is also the freeholder of the majority of the remaining leasehold properties in the Suburb, which are mostly held on very long leases.

==Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906==

Urban town planning had been restricted by the bylaws established after the Public Health Act 1875, which had de facto called for a grid-iron street layout and a minimum housing density. This had prevented Cadbury building workers’ houses within a city and caused Rowntree to build his housing in rural parishes. For Unwin to design a street structure that followed the contours and build houses in cul-de-sacs an act of Parliament was needed. The Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust sponsored a private bill, which was passed as the Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906 (6 Edw. 7. c. cxcii).

The three relevant sections of the act were

; Section 2


; Section 3
; Section 5
Section 2, defined a low building density, and wide streets with gardens or verges where trees could be planted. Section 5 distinguished between through-roads and accommodation roads, residential cul-de-sacs under . It recognised the difference between cul-de-sac roads of limited length and other roads, and allowed the suspension of the operation of certain local planning bye-laws 
==Parks and nature reserves==
The Suburb has large areas of open space, including Central Square; Hampstead Heath Extension; Northway Gardens; Lyttelton Playing Fields; and Big Wood and Little Wood. The southern end is close to Golders Hill Park.

==Politics==
Hampstead Garden Suburb is represented by two Councillors on Barnet Council.

Hampstead Garden Suburb is in the parliamentary constituency of Finchley and Golders Green. As of 2024, it is represented by Sarah Sackman of the Labour Party.

<doc id="1139056" wikidata="Q4664274" url="?curid=1139056" title="Abbotsbury Abbey">
<text>Abbotsbury Abbey, dedicated to Saint Peter, was a Benedictine monastery in the village of Abbotsbury in Dorset, England. The abbey was founded in the 11th century by King Cnut&#x27;s thegn Orc and his wife Tola, who handsomely endowed the monastery with lands in the area. The abbey prospered and became a local centre of power, controlling eight manor houses and villages. During the later Middle Ages, the abbey suffered much misfortune. In the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the last abbot surrendered the abbey and the site became the property of Sir Giles Strangways.

Today, a small part of the former Abbey estate, including the abbey&#x27;s remains, and those of the nearby St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, are in the guardianship of English Heritage.

==History==
===Foundation===
The first reference to the site of Abbotsbury may be in a charter of King Edmund (r. 939–946) recording a grant of five hides of land at &quot;Abbedesburi&quot; to the thegn Sigewulf. The name (&quot;Abbedesburi&quot;) may suggest that the land had once belonged to an abbot. During the reign of King Cnut (r. 1016–1035), the Scandinavian thegn Orc (also Urki, Urk) and his wife Tola took up residence in the area, having been granted land at Portesham. Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) also granted him Wootton and it was early in his reign that the couple founded a monastery at Abbotsbury, previously the site of a minor church. Orc and Tola, who had no children, enriched the monastery with a substantial amount of land, some of which was bequeathed after their deaths. By the time of the Domesday survey, Abbotsbury (itself worth 21 hides) was recorded to have held more than 65 hides of land TRE. Orc also established his own guild, which according to the extant statutes, had its hall at Abbotsbury and protected the minster&#x27;s interests.

===Last period and dissolution===
During the 14th century the Black Death killed many villagers and also the abbot. Moreover, the village was repeatedly attacked from the sea, reducing the security of the abbey and its status. In addition, the area suffered depredations from the forces sent to man the coastal defences. Later that century and in the century following the Abbey&#x27;s situation had started to improve somewhat. In 1535 and 1539 Henry VIII undertook the forcible Dissolution of the Monasteries. Under the last Abbot of Abbotsbury, Roger Roddon, the Abbey was dissolved in 1539, following a visit from Dr. Thomas Legh (Leigh, Lee).

Upon the surrender of the abbey, on 12 March 1539, Abbot Roger Roddon, along with the prior and eight brethren received pensions: the abbot, £80; the prior, Thomas Bradford, £9; Thomas Tolpuddle, £7; six other brethren, including William Grey and John Vynsant, £6 to £5 each; Thomas Holnest, 40s.
Sir Giles Strangways (died 1546), the commissioner who had dissolved the monastery and who bought the abbey buildings, manor houses, water mills and Abbotsbury Swannery and much of the abbey&#x27;s land for £1,906, 10s (equivalent to £ in ). On the one hand Strangways&#x27; own father had in fact been buried in the Abbey, and when he himself died in 1546 his will bequeathed £6 13s.4d. a year for two years for a priest to say Mass for the repose of his soul and the souls of his wife and son.

Henry VIII granted the abbey site to Sir Giles Strangways. Much of the land still belongs to Strangways&#x27; descendants, the Earls of Ilchester.

===Known Abbots of Abbotsbury===


===Burials===
*Humphrey Stafford (died 1413) and wife Elizabeth d&#x27;Aumale Mautravers Stafford
*Sir John Mautravers
*Humphrey Stafford (died 1442)

==Architecture and historic listing designations==
As was customary in such cases, Abbotsbury Abbey was largely demolished to maximize profit from the sale and to allow its stone to be reused.

The 14th century Tithe Barn, which at 272 ft by 31 ft is reputedly the largest thatched tithe barn in the world, was spared. Though now only half roofed, the still impressive structure has two porches, each surmounted by a watching chamber. Also spared from the general destruction was St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, used at one time as a lookout across the sea and conversely as a landmark for mariners. Both are currently Grade I listed buildings and scheduled monuments.
 In the churchyard to the south of the present parish church, traces of the north wall of the abbey are visible. These remnants are also listed at Grade I. Other Grade I listed buildings at the site include the Malthouse, and the Dairy House. There are four structures listed at Grade II*; the Pigeon House, a gable end section of wall called Pynion&#x27;s End, a gatehouse, and a run of cottages, the Abbott&#x27;s Walk. Grade II buildings include a gateway, Abbey House, and a Granary. The Abbey&#x27;s former swannery is an internationally famous nature reserve.

<text>The PZL P.24 is a Polish fighter aircraft, built in the late 1930s by Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze. It was a much more advanced development of the PZL P.11, a Polish wing all-metal fighter designed by Zygmunt Puławski.

While the PZL P.11 had been powered with a license-built Bristol Mercury radial engine, the terms of this license did not permit PZL to export the engine as well as placing restrictions upon any aircraft that were powered by it. The French engine manufacturer Gnome-Rhône proposed the adoption of their 14K engine to PZL and offered to partially finance the development of a fighter using the engine, which would have no such export restrictions. Accordingly, during early 1932, PZL commenced work on a new derivative of the P.11, which became known as the PZL P.24. The prototypes soon demonstrated favourable performance during testing; notably, the second P.24/II prototype, often referred to as the &quot;Super P.24&quot;, established a new world speed record for a radial engine-powered fighter of 414 km/h. The initial production aircraft closely resembled the P.24/II configuration, albeit with some changes such as the adoption of an enclosed cockpit.

In 1936, PZL received orders for the new fighter from several countries. The PZL P.24 entered service with the Turkish Air Force at the beginning of 1937, and with the Bulgarian Air Force in the summer of that year. It was produced under licence by Romanian state manufacturer Industria Aeronautică Română (IAR), who had also licence-produced the earlier PZL P.11. Many elements of the PZL P.24, such as the fuselage, engine cowling, cockpit and tail section, were incorporated into a Romanian-designed low-wing fighter, the IAR 80. In Greece, the Royal Hellenic Air Force was the only air service in Second World War to operate the PZL P.24 as its primary fighter. However, wartime experience soon showed that, as a result of the rapid advances in aircraft design made during the late 1930s, the P.24 had become outdated as early as 1940. Despite a relatively powerful engine and satisfactory armament, it could not stand up against the latest Axis fighters, such as the Italian Macchi MC.200 and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109. Just like the Greek fighters, by 1942, it had become clear that Romania&#x27;s P.24s were unable to effectively challenge the latest fighters of the Soviet VVS as well, and were relegated to training tasks.

==Development==
===Background===
During the early 1930s, PZL had developed a series of innovative gull wing all-metal fighters, headed by Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Puławski. The P.1, the P.7, and the P.11, each more refined than its preceding aircraft, were capable of outstanding performance for their time and were widely displayed at international exhibitions and competitive fly-offs, demonstrating their capabilities to the world. The Polish monoplanes were subject to considerable international interest, leading to PZL&#x27;s offices receiving a deluge of enquiries on the topic of prospective export sales. According to aviation author J.B. Cynk, by 1933, outward interest had been expressed by Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Turkey and Yugoslavia.

In order for any export sales of the type to be successfully completed, PZL had to address two major obstacles. Firstly, the company was only capable of producing so many aircraft in the space of a year; PZL did not have the internal resources to substantially expand its production capacity, nor was financing from the Polish government or other bodies viewed as being particularly forthcoming during this time. According to Cynk, tentative customers for the fighter were typically adverse to making large currency exchanges as part of their payments, instead, they would usually prefer to pay in terms of goods (such as raw resources and industrial products) or to pay in numerous installments. Furthermore, Cynk claims that several deals which had been formed with PZL had fallen through or had been otherwise postponed due to difficulties encountered in agreeing acceptable terms of payment between the customer and the manufacturer.

Another issue was posed by the engine used by the P.11. It was powered by a single Bristol Mercury radial engine, which was produced in Poland under a licensing agreement with the British Bristol Aeroplane Company; however, the terms of the 10-year agreement had stipulated that none of the Polish-built engines could be exported. In addition, the licensing agreement had placed restrictions upon the sale of those aircraft which were powered by the Bristol engine; these export restrictions were present even if the engines were to be supplied by the customers rather than by PZL themselves. Naturally, PZL was keen to eliminate or otherwise minimise any restrictions that were deterring export sales of their aircraft.

According to Cynk, the initiative to develop a dedicated export-focused derivative of the P.11 received a considerable boost during the early 1930s by a French Air Force initiative to furnish itself with a large force of modern first-rate fighters. While the majority of projects considered by French officials were indigenously-developed, the French Air Force was also evaluating various foreign fighters as potential candidates for being licence-produced in France; Cynk claims that the P.11 was at the top of their list. This attention may have contributed to the decision by French engine manufacturer Gnome-Rhône to offer PZL a financial contribution of 150,000 francs towards the development of an export-suitable P.11 derivative, as well as to provide the first prototype&#x27;s engine for free and to sponsor the fighter for the French competition, all of which was conditional to the selection of their engine to power the type.

===Project launch===
In accordance with these converging interests, PZL decided to embark upon preliminary design work into the prospective development of a further evolved form of the P.11 that would be aimed specifically at the export market. The project, and the resulting design produced by it, soon received its own designation as the &quot;P.24&quot;. The Gnome-Rhône 14K, a powerful French radial engine, had quickly emerged as a strong candidate to power the tentative fighter; thus the engine company&#x27;s offer of support was quickly accepted. The project was headed by Wsiewolod Jakimiuk, who had assumed the position early on after the untimely death of Puławski on 21 March 1931. During February 1932, the P.24 proposal was submitted for internal approval; this was granted two months later.

During May 1933, the first &quot;P.24/I&quot; prototype, which was largely based on the P.11a and powered by a Gnome-Rhône 14Kds engine, conducted its maiden flight, flown by Bolesław Orliński. This flight had been delayed since January 1933 due to a failure on the part of Gnome-Rhône to promptly deliver either the engine or its three-bladed metal propeller. Even following the installation of the engine and an alternative Szomanski-built propeller, issues were encountered during pre-flight powered runs, such as seizing fuel pumps. The maiden flight had not gone smoothly either; it had been cut short after severe vibrations had shattered the hub fairing, further damage to the propeller blades, engine bearing structure, and fuel tank attachments was also incurred, leading to the forward section of the prototype being reconstructed and reinforced. During October 1933, flight tests resumed.

The experiences with the first prototype had determined that in excess of 150 modifications to various aspects of the design, including the adoption of a long-chord NACA cowling, the reinforcement of a cannon mounting structure and the revision of the exhaust and cooling systems, were required, leading to the construction of a second prototype, known as the &quot;P.24/II&quot;. Performing its first flight during March 1934, this prototype, also named the &quot;Super P.24&quot;, quickly demonstrated its excellent performance, such as its ability to easily exceed 400 km/h in level flight. On 28 June 1934, P.24/II established a Fédération Aéronautique Internationale-recognised world speed record for radial engine-powered fighters of 414 km/h. Following Gnome-Rhône&#x27;s announcement of the existence of a more powerful 14Kfs engine, a third &quot;P.24/III&quot; prototype, otherwise known as the &quot;Super P.24bis&quot;, was called for, powered by this new engine. However, this engine was not immediately available due to a prior order placed by Finland having taken precedence; as such, the first 14Kfs engine did not arrive until July 1934.

During August 1934, the third prototype conducted its first flight; two months later, it performed a demonstration outside Warsaw attended by various Polish officials and several members of foreign missions. During late 1934, the newly-completed P.24/III was publicly displayed at the Paris Air Show, where it reportedly attracted a high level of interest from visitors and other participants alike. According to Cynk, at the time of the Paris Air Show, the P.24 was commonly considered to have been both the quickest and the best-armed interceptor in the world. While the French Air Force were still expressing interest in the P.24 at this point, there was considerable political resistance to the procurement of it due to its non-indigenous origins and that French manufacturers were making their own advances, including some of those that were featured upon the P.24. As such, a French order was not forthcoming for the type.

===Production===
During late 1934 and early 1935, the P.24/III was involved in several promotional flights, including evaluation flights held near Warsaw on behalf of visiting Turkish and Romanian military officials, as well as a demonstration tour which saw it visit neighbouring Hungary and Bulgaria. In the spring of 1935, having judged the likelihood of sales to have been high at this point, PZL decided to commence work on a batch of six pre-production P.24s at their Warsaw plant. Unlike the prototypes, these aircraft had enclosed cockpits and the armaments were entirely carried within the wings rather than the forward fuselage, as well as the adoption of wing and tail surfaces reminiscent of the P.11c, alongside minor refinements and alterations. Different armament arrangements were installed across the pre-production aircraft, representative to the configuration that was intended for several separate production models. One pre-production aircraft was shown at the 1936 Paris Air Show, after which it conducted several demonstration flights on behalf of the French Air Force.

Gradually, the pre-production P.24s were modified to closely represent successive production variants of the type; this work included the installation of alternative engines, including the Gnome-Rhône 14N01, the Gnome-Rhône 14N21, the Renault 14T, and the Fiat A.80, which were freely provided by their respective manufacturers. During early 1936, Turkey became the first customer to place a firm order for the P.24, completing a deal to not only by 40 Polish-built fighters, but also a licensing arrangement and the materials to domestically produce a further 20 P.24As. These early fighters, which were furnished with a range of different armaments to conform with the specified Turkish requirements, were otherwise nearly identical to the pre-production aircraft. Production commenced almost immediately; the first deliveries took place in late 1936.

Following the encountering of greater-than-anticipated drag on early production aircraft, various aerodynamic improvements were implemented upon the next variant of the fighter, designated as the P.24C, which made up the majority of the Turkish order. On 29 May 1937, the first Turkish-built P.24 conducted its maiden flight, flown by Izfam Bay. According to Cynk, it is believed that in excess of 100 P.24s were ultimately constructed in Turkey at a peak rate of eight fighters being finished per month. Over time, a large proportion of Turkey&#x27;s P.24 fleet were reportedly refitted with American Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp radial engines. Further orders for the type soon came from Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. These aircraft featured various modifications, including increased endurance, customised armaments, and further aerodynamic improvements.

Despite being an objectively superior fighter to its P.11 predecessor, no P.24s were ever acquired by the Polish Air Force, which preferred to wait for the more advanced PZL.50. When it had become clear that the PZL.50 would not become available in time to counter the now-imminent German attack, figures within the Polish Air Force, such as General Józef Zając, advocated an accelerated purchase of the type. In addition, the viability of such a venture was increased by the issuing of a French armament loan permitting a large quantity of 14K engines to be purchased by Poland. During early 1939, an initial order for 70 P.24Hs was placed. This order was supplemented by orders for a variant of the older P.11, the P.11g, as well. Despite numerous rumours claiming such, there were no PZL.24s in use by the Polish defenders during the Polish Campaign; these rumours may have been a result of the common misidentification of the P.11 as being the later P.24 by German spotters.

As late as 1939, further improvements of the P.24 were being studied. The conceptual P.24K, which was to feature an armament of four 20mm cannon, and the P.24L, a dedicated fighter-bomber design, were amongst the proposals mooted. Furthermore, significant international interest in the type was present at this point. According to Cynk, during 1939, negotiations for several large orders were either at an advanced stage or had been finalised; these customers had included Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. However, none of these orders, tentative or otherwise, totalling in excess of 190 P.24s, would be completed; they were effectively cancelled as a consequence of the German invasion and occupation of Poland during September 1939.

==Design==
The &quot;PZL P.24&quot; was a gull wing all-metal fighter aircraft that drew extensively on the design of the earlier P.11, being essentially a more powerful and export-friendly version of it. It possessed a relatively conventional in layout, but incorporated more recent innovations such as its all-metal structure and exterior covering, along with its then-unusual wing shape. The gull wing, otherwise known as &quot;the Polish wing&quot;, was developed by Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Puławski; it possessed several advantages over its biplane contemporaries. One such benefit was the thin profile it presented as it drew near to the fuselage, which avoided obstructing the exterior view for the pilot. The wings used a modified Bartler 37/11a aerofoil section, sharply tapering in chord and thickness towards the tips and roots and incorporating an upwards twist towards the trailing edge for improved visibility; they were largely composed of duralumin, including the twin spars, ribs, and corrugated exterior, which was smooth on the leading edge and wing tips.

The fuselage of the P.24 possessed an oval all-metal structure, the forward section of which comprising built-up girder sections and the rear using a combination of transverse duralumin bulkheads and smooth stressed skin construction. The tail unit, which shared similar construction to the wings, was fitted with a cantilever fin, a braced tailplane, while the elevators were furnished with Flettner tabs. The P.24 was provided with a conventional &quot;scissor-type&quot; fixed landing gear arrangement; each leg incorporated an independently spring oleo-pneumatic shock absorber, built by Avia. The wheels were furnished with spats and worked in conjunction with a fixed skid located almost directly underneath the aircraft&#x27;s tail section. The undercarriage configuration was a patented innovation.

The P.24 was powered either by a Gnome-Rhône 14K or Gnome-Rhône 14N supercharged geared radial engine, ranging in output from 900 hp to 1,050 hp, which drove a three-bladed metal variable-pitch propeller. The armament was a combination of 20 mm Oerlikon FF cannon and 7.92 mm Colt-Browning machine guns in the wings. On the P.24A, P.24E and P.24F models, it was armed with a pair of cannon and a pair of machine guns, while the P.24B, P.24C and P.24G variants were armed with an arrangement of four machine guns. Fuel was housed with an internal 360 liter tank located within the fuselage; in case of fire or similar emergency situations, this tank could be jettisoned. On all production P.24s, the canopy was fully enclosed; according to Cynk, it provided pilots with exceptionally high levels of external visibility in comparison to other fighter aircraft of the era. The pilot&#x27;s seat was adjustable and could accommodate either a back or seat-type parachute; it was normally equipped with a Borkowski self-adjusting safety belt system.

==Operational history==
===Greece===
The Royal Hellenic Air Force (EVA) was the only air force during the Second World War to operate the PZL.24 as its main fighter type. Two different subtypes, consisting of 30 P.24F and six P.24G, were ordered and delivered between 1937 and 1938. Upon arrival, these were split between three Mirae Dioxeos (Fighter Squadrons): the 21st at Trikala, 22nd at Thessaloniki and 23rd at Larissa. The only other operational Greek fighters, stationed further south, were eight Bloch MB.151s and two each Gloster Gladiator Mk Is and Avia B-534 II, both of which were of limited value. During October 1940, the month in which Italy launched its invasion of Greece, the Polish fighter was the Greeks&#x27; only modern type in adequate numbers. However, by 1940, the P.24 was no longer a front-runner, despite its use of a powerful powerplant and a satisfactory armament; the P.24 had no speed advantage over the Fiat CR.42, nor could it outfly the nimble Italian biplane, while it was considerably slower than the Macchi MC.200 and the Fiat G.50 it was often pitted against. Its armament was the only real advantage against the Italian fighters, whose reliance on the slow-firing Breda-SAFAT 12.7mm machine guns proved detrimental.

The P.24F, armed with a pair of 20mm Oerlikon FF cannon and two machine guns, gave the Greeks a temporary edge in combat until lack of ammunition and spares forced EVA to re-arm all P.24Fs with four Colt–Browning 7.7 mm MG40 machine guns. Overall, the P.24s performed gallantly during the early period of the conflict, holding their own against impossible numerical odds and despite the fact that their main target were enemy bombers, which forced them to fight at a disadvantage against enemy fighters. Italian claims of easy superiority over the Albanian front were vastly exaggerated and their kill claims even exceeded the total number of operational fighters on the Greek side. In total, Greek fighter losses in combat came to 24 aircraft, while the Greek fighter pilots claimed to have achieved 64 confirmed kills and 24 probables, around two-thirds of which were bombers). By April 1941, however, lack of spares and attrition had forced EVA to merge the five surviving P.24s into one understrength squadron, which was supported by five Gloster Gladiator Mk I and II&#x27;s and the two surviving MB.151s. That month, these remaining fighters fought hopelessly against the Luftwaffe onslaught, scoring 4 kills (two Hs 126, one Ju 87B and one Do 17) while losing most of their surviving aircraft on the ground. None of the Puławski fighters are believed to have survived the conflict.

===Romania===
Prior to its procurement of the P.24, the Romanian Air Force had already adopted the P.11F, which was manufactured under license by Industria Aeronautică Română (IAR) in Romania. The Romanian Air Force acquired a production license for the type along with an initial batch of six Polish-built P.24Es, which served as pattern aircraft. The P.24E was specifically designed in conform with the requirements set out by the Romanian Air Force, including compatibility with its IAR-built model of the 14K engine, its two-cannon and two-machine gun armament, and various refinements and aerodynamic improvements. Under the established licensing agreement, IAR proceeded with the construction of 25 &quot;IAR P.24E&quot; fighters by IAR between 1937 and 1939. According to Cynk, the P.24E had played a significant role in the development of a new Romanian low-wing monoplane fighter, which was designated as the IAR 80. Specifically, the new fighter had adopted a fuselage which had been derived from the P.24, along with a nearly-identical tail section, which was paired up to a new cantilever wing and an inwardly-retractable undercarriage.

In Romanian service, the type saw combat action during the Second World War; early on, Romanian P.24s were used to guard the capital city of Bucharest and the Ploieşti oilfields from attacks by Soviet bombers during the start of Operation Barbarossa. Flying from Otopeni military airbase, the P.24 fighters reportedly managed to shoot down 37 VVS bombers, which were typically unescorted and thereby more vulnerable to interception. The P.24E was also routinely used for ground attack missions until the end of 1941; however, after 1942, the type was relegated to training duties because of its obsolescence in the face of improved opposition fighter aircraft.

==Variants==
During the development of Puławski fighters, a new version of the P.11, the P.11c, was developed for the Polish Air Force. It had a new, reconfigured fuselage, and the radial engine was lowered to give a pilot a better view. These changes were also applied to the new P.24 prototype, flown in 1936.

The P.24A and P.24B models could carry 4 x 12.5 kg bombs, while the P.24C, F and G could carry 2 x 50 kg bombs.

==Operators==

*Bulgarian Air Force ordered 14 PZL P.24B fighters in 1936, delivered 1937–1938. Bulgaria placed a repeat order for 20 PZL P.24C, to be delivered by the end of 1938. It later ordered 26 PZL P.24Fs, 22 of which were delivered from Poland in July 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II. The remaining four, lacking propellers, were bombed in the Okęcie factory in September 1939 by the Germans. The total order was 56 PZL P.24B/C/F.
*Royal Hellenic Air Force ordered 12 P.24F and 24 P.24G fighters in 1936, delivered 1937–1938. Due to difficulties in obtaining ammunition for 20mm autocannons during the war, all F version planes were eventually rearmed with 4x Colt–Browning 7.7mm MGs.
*Royal Romanian Air Force ordered 5 PZL P.24E fighters in 1937, acquired a production license and built 25 E version aircraft in Romania under the local designation IAR P.24P.
*Turkish Air Force ordered 14 P.24A and 26 P.24C, delivered by 1937. Another 20 P.24A/Cs were built under license in 1939 in Turkey at the Kayseri Aircraft Factory (Turkish: &quot;Kayseri Tayyare Fabrikası&quot;), followed by further 30 P.24G aircraft.

==Surviving aircraft==
The only surviving example of a PZL P.24 in the world is an example in Turkey. Photographs of the Turkish museum piece show a variety of serial numbering (2015, 2017, 2145, 2147) and are shot at different locations: (Ankara and Istanbul), but original aircraft is mistaken with one full-scale fiberglass replica.
