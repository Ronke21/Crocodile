<text>The 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 6 April 2003 at Autódromo José Carlos Pace (Interlagos). It was the third round of the 2003 Formula One World Championship, the 32nd Brazilian Grand Prix and the 700th Formula One World Championship race.

The race was scheduled to run for 71 laps, but was stopped on lap 56 after two major crashes blocked the circuit. Due to confusion about the timing of the red flag, the win was initially awarded to Kimi Räikkönen of McLaren, with Giancarlo Fisichella of Jordan in second and Fernando Alonso of Renault in third. However, following a post-race appeal by the Jordan team, eventually heard in court, it was established that Fisichella was leading when the race results were declared, and he was awarded the win with Räikkönen demoted to second. Alonso remained in third place; he had missed the podium ceremony at the time as he was receiving medical attention. It was attended by 120,000 spectators.

The race was Fisichella&#x27;s first Grand Prix victory. It was also Jordan&#x27;s fourth and final victory, and the team&#x27;s 200th Grand Prix. This was the first victory for a Ford engine since the 1999 European Grand Prix, and the first victory for an Italian driver since Riccardo Patrese won the 1992 Japanese Grand Prix. This was also the last victory for a Ford-powered car to date, and marked the last time the Brazilian Grand Prix was held during the opening rounds of a Formula One season.

==Background==

The 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix was the third of sixteen scheduled single seater motor races of the 2003 Formula One World Championship, the 32nd edition of the event and the 700th Formula One World Championship round. It took place at the 15-turn Autódromo José Carlos Pace in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on 6 April 2003. The bumpy track placed a large amount of strain and g-force onto a driver. To compensate for cars being driven over its bumpy surface, teams employed a computer programme fed into a chassis to reconstruct every movement under undulation. Under a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; Formula One&#x27;s governing body) regulation mandating Formula One&#x27;s two tyre suppliers Bridgestone and Michelin to bring a single wet-weather tyre compound to each race to lower operating costs: Michelin brought the full wets and Bridgestone the intermediates.

After winning the Malaysian Grand Prix two weeks earlier, McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen led the World Drivers&#x27; Championship with 16 points, six ahead of his teammate David Coulthard in second. Juan Pablo Montoya of Williams, Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello and Fernando Alonso for Renault tied for third with eight points each. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren led with 26 points; Ferrari and Renault were tied for second position with 16 points. Williams were a further two points behind in fourth and Sauber in fifth had four points. Following the 2002 edition, race organisers invested $1.7 million in resurfacing of track surface in an attempt to reduce its bumpiness, rebuilt its drainage system and introduced run-off areas in the first seven turns.

In preparation for the race, the majority of teams conducted in-season test sessions at the Circuit de Catalunya (now called the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya) in Spain from 25 to 28 March 2003 and worked to alter the aerodynamic performance of their cars. Sauber and Williams evaluated revised chassis components and both teams assessed their selection of tyre compounds from the Malaysian Grand Prix, optimising the setup of their vehicles to better suit it. A lap of 1 minute and 17.288 seconds topped the time sheets for the Williams test driver Marc Gené on the first day. Pedro de la Rosa, the McLaren test driver, set the second day&#x27;s fastest time, a 1-minute and 15.506 seconds. Williams&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher set the quickest lap on the third day, lowering the overall best time to a 1-minute and 15.352 seconds. On the final day (held in heavy rain in the morning and sunshine for most of the afternoon) Ralf Schumacher remained fastest overall with a lap of 1 minute and 17.591 seconds. Toyota test driver Ricardo Zonta drove a Toyota TF102B for three days at the Circuit Paul Ricard evaluating its tyres.

The defending World Drivers&#x27; Champion Michael Schumacher of Ferrari was criticised by the German and Italian press for a sub-par beginning to the season. Schumacher said he expected criticism and thought Ferrari would have an advantage on circuits that suited his team better than others, &quot;The first two races are not too good. Still, we got eight points out of these not very good races for us and our time will come again.&quot; Räikkönen, the Drivers Championship leader, said he would approach the race in the same method as he did in the preceding Malaysian Grand Prix, as Giancarlo Fisichella was eager to score for the Jordan team in its 200th Formula One race, &quot;I trained and prepared hard for Sepang but unfortunately I did not get off the mark. So my target for the Brazilian Grand Prix is to take the chequered flag and bring points to the team and looking at the way the car ran strongly with Ralph in Malaysia, I know I can get both jobs done.&quot;

Two weeks before the Grand Prix, the FIA announced drivers would no longer be granted dispensation to compete in Formula One races without wearing a HANS device. It stated any competitor who could not wear a HANS device for medical reasons would be barred from driving in future events. This stance was ratified at a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 2 April. Minardi driver Justin Wilson was passed fit by the FIA medical delegate Sid Watkins to take part in the event. At the previous race, Wilson suffered from pain in his shoulders which was caused by a loose HANS device and seat belt, causing him to move about freely in his car&#x27;s cockpit and pinching a nerve that paralysed both his arms. Wilson visited the team&#x27;s headquarters in Faenza, Italy to test a twin seat belt system installed in his car to prevent a similar occurrence. Barrichello, who had a minor hernia and received dispensation from the stewards not to wear a HANS device for medical reasons, was at risk of being dropped for the race in the event a solution to his discomfort was not found. He tested a new HANS device during free practice and reported no discomfort, leaving the services of the Ferrari reserve driver Felipe Massa unneeded.

A total of ten teams (each represented by a different constructor) entered two race drivers each for the race with no changes from the season entry list. Some teams made changes to their vehicles for the event. Williams installed a revised gearbox unit and rear suspension bracket designed specially for the FW25. The team also fitted a revised specification of front wing, modified a terminal section of the car&#x27;s bodywork and rectified a rear wing issue. The Ferrari and Renault teams introduced new specifications of rear wing: Ferrari&#x27;s wing changes featured semi-circular holes in the outer part of its main profile to limit vortex and was used solely by Barrichello. Renault adopted a rear wing characterised by a sinuous shape of its profiles, which was stood up sharply in the bulkheads section.

==Private test session==
On Friday morning, a two-hour test session took place for teams who opted for limited testing during the season. In variable weather conditions that saw rain fell 90 minutes in, Renault driver Jarno Trulli set the session&#x27;s fastest lap, a 1-minute and 14.262 seconds. Antônio Pizzonia was second in a Jaguar and his teammate Mark Webber third. Alonso, Fisichella, Allan McNish, the Renault test driver, Minardi&#x27;s Jos Verstappen, Ralph Firman for Jordan and Wilson made up positions four to nine. During the session, Pizzonia drove the spare Jaguar after a mechanical fault stopped his race car at the Subida dos Boxes corner. With 36 minutes remaining, Firman abandoned his car in the pit lane with a drive shaft problem. Alonso subsequently spun on the Reta Oposta straight and was beached in a gravel trap at the Descida do Lago turn. His Renault was undamaged.

==Practice and warm-up sessions==

There were three practice sessions preceding Sunday&#x27;s race: one 60-minute session on Friday morning and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday morning. In the first practice session, held in torrential weather conditions and saw four drivers record no lap times, Michael Schumacher was quickest with a lap of 1 minute and 28.060 seconds, followed by Coulthard, British American Racing (BAR) driver Jenson Button, Trulli, Montoya, Barrichello, the Toyota pair of Olivier Panis and Cristiano da Matta, Fisichella and Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Sauber. Seconds after Räikkönen exited the pit lane, he lost control of his vehicle into the Reta Oposta straight and spun onto some grass. He narrowly avoided a collision with a barrier to his left. With fifteen minutes to go, Pizzonia crashed heavily leaving the Curva do Sol turn and struck the barriers on both sides of the circuit on his first timed lap, temporarily stopping the session so that his Jaguar car could be removed from the track. After the session restarted, Alonso slid on the wet track and made minor contact against a wall at the Senna S chicane.

The circuit was sodden for the beginning of the second practice session and dried as it progressed to provide every driver with dry track acclimatisation. Barrichello set the pace with a 1-minute and 14.071 seconds lap. Ralf Schumacher, Montoya, Michael Schumacher, Alonso, Räikkönen, Pizzonia, Webber, Coulthard and Heidfeld made up positions two to ten. In warm weather conditions, the final practice session was led by Panis who recorded a time of 1 minute and 13.457 seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Trulli, Coulthard, Montoya, Räikkönen, Barrichello, Webber, Ralf Schumacher and Alonso. Several competitors spun during the session; none sustained damage to their cars. Räikkönen paced a fifteen-minute warm-up session that took place before the second qualifying session with a lap of 1 minute and 13.886 seconds. Barrichello, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Montoya, Webber, Button, Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve and Heidfeld were second to tenth.

== Qualifying ==
The torrential rain observed in practice prompted several drivers to express concerns they would lose control of their vehicles and crash. Around twenty minutes before the first qualifying session, Coulthard, a senior member of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association, Trulli and Michael Schumacher wrote a petition mandating the FIA cancel the session if there was no improvement in the track conditions. The petition was signed by a majority of drivers; it was later disregarded after it was unable to be sent to everyone in time and race officials had deemed the circuit safe to drive on after the rain tapered off before qualifying commenced. Jacques Villeneuve of BAR said the petition was detrimental to Formula One, &quot;What would it bring to Formula One for us not to go and qualify? People would think that we are just a bunch of sissies. We can&#x27;t do that. We are paid a whole lot of money and it would be an insult to the fans.&quot;

There were two one-hour qualifying sessions, one on both Friday and Saturday afternoons. The World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings set the first session&#x27;s running order (first to last) with the second run in reverse of the first session times (slowest to fastest). Each competitor recorded one timed lap in each session and the starting order was determined by the second session&#x27;s quickest laps. The level of standing water fluctuated during the session. Webber took provisional pole position on a drying track with a 1-minute and 23.249 seconds lap. He was 0.138 seconds faster than Barrichello in second, who had pole until Webber&#x27;s lap. Räikkönen, the first driver to set a lap, was third and his teammate Coulthard, fourth, made a driver error at Bico de Pato corner. Michael Schumacher aquaplaned shortly after leaving the pit lane and took fifth. Panis&#x27;s Toyota was not setup for the wet-weather conditions and took sixth. Villeneuve was seventh; Pizzonia, eighth, drove the spare Jaguar and aquaplaned on the start/finish straight.

Alonso, ninth, was circumspect, as Frentzen, tenth. reported an adequate car balance. An incorrect setup put Da Matta 11th. The wet-weather conditions restricted Trulli to 12th and an unbalanced car in slow speed corners left Ralf Schumacher in 13th. An oversteer and lack of grip restricted Fisichella to 14th as Verstappen extracted additional performance from his car to finish in 15th. Heidfeld was circumspect through the Arquibancdas turn en route to 16th. Montoya in 17th lost control of the rear of his Williams under braking and went onto a concrete run-off area at Ferradura corner. Firman in 18th drove with the rear of Jordan&#x27;s spare car attached to his race vehicle. Wilson avoided a spin on the start/finish straight and was 19th. Button was the only driver not to set a lap time: he had a sudden oversteer when he ran onto a damp white line denoting the track boundaries, and aquaplaned at almost . Button went through two polystyrene boards, removed his car&#x27;s rear wing and abandoned the attempt. The session was temporarily stopped to clear on-track debris.

The second qualifying session was held in warm and dry weather conditions. Barrichello had the lap time display on his steering wheel switched off so he could be focused. This earned him pole position, the first for a Brazilian driver at the track since Ayrton Senna in the 1994 event, his first since the 2002 Hungarian Grand Prix and the seventh of his career with a 1-minute and 13.807 seconds lap. Barrichello was joined on the grid&#x27;s front row by Coulthard who was 0.11 seconds slower after McLaren changed his car&#x27;s balance. Webber was set to take pole position until a driver error at Pinheirinho demoted him to third. A driver error at the same turn and a loose car left Räikkönen in fourth as Trulli moved to fifth. Excessive oversteer and circumspect braking restricted Ralf Schumacher to sixth. Michael Schumacher made a minor error at the Senna S chicane and was seventh; he took his lowest grid position since he started ninth at the 1998 German Grand Prix. Fisichella qualified eighth, Montoya had an oversteer that put him ninth and Alonso was tenth. Button set the 11th-fastest lap, with his teammate Villeneuve 13th after an intermittent loss of power in the Senna S chicane; Heidfeld in 12th separated the pair. Frentzen took 14th and Panis (who made a driver error) 15th. Firman changed his car&#x27;s setup and qualified 16th due to a driver error, ahead of Pizzonia in 17th, who had brake problems and an unbalanced car. An tight handling car and an unsuccessful fix to the problems left Da Matta in 18th. The Minardi cars were equipped with a hard compound tyre and completed the starting order in 19th and 20th (Verstappen ahead of Wilson).

===Qualifying classification===

* — Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Ralph Firman, Antônio Pizzonia and Jos Verstappen started from the pit lane.

==Race==
On the morning of 6 April, McLaren sought permission from the FIA to change Räikkönen&#x27;s engine after a crack in its casting was detected via telemetry. The FIA authorised the engine switch after it analysed data proving the engine was damaged. Telemetry from BAR also detected damage to Villeneuve&#x27;s engine and were also allowed to change it. Rain was forecast for the race; at the start the track was flooded because of a torrential downpour that fell from at 11:00 Brasilia Time (UTC−02:00). 120,000 spectators attended the Grand Prix. It was due to commence at 14:00 local time, before the FIA race director Charlie Whiting delayed it for fifteen minutes, to enable standing water to be drained from the circuit. Event organisers permitted teams to alter the setup of their cars to run on a sodden track, specially the wings and ride heights. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all vehicles used wet-weather tyre compounds. The track&#x27;s deficient drainage caused a large amount of water to cascade from a slope onto the tarmac surface at the Curva do Sol corner and made it susceptible for cars to aquaplane.

The race began behind the safety car, with no formation lap; notwithstanding the slow speed drivers struggled for grip on the flooded track surface. Some drivers (including Verstappen, Frentzen, Pizzonia, Panis, Fisichella and Firman) elected to make pit stops for fuel under safety car conditions in an attempt to avoid having to make a second pit stop later in the race. After the rain had stopped, the safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap eight, and cars were allowed to overtake. Barrichello bunched up the field on the approach to the start/finish line; the manoeuvre failed to work and Coulthard passed him for the lead under braking for the Senna S chicane. Barrichello was circumspect for the rest of the lap as Webber and Räikkönen pressured him. Further down the order, Montoya moved from ninth to fifth. Heidfeld became the Grand Prix&#x27;s first retirement on lap nine when his engineers informed him over the radio of an oil feed problem that cut out his engine. He pulled off to the side of the track to ensure that no oil was deposited on the racing line.

On lap ten, Räikkönen overtook Barrichello for second at the Senna S chicane and lost third when Montoya passed him later that lap. There were overtakes further down the field on that lap. Ralf Schumacher moved past Trulli for sixth and Pizzonia passed Verstappen for fifteenth. On the 11th lap, Räikkönen closed up to his teammate Coulthard and passed him to take the lead on the approach to the Senna S chicane. Not long after Montoya overtook Coulthard for third at the end of the Reta Oposta straight that leads to the Descida do Lago corner. That same lap, Ralf Schumacher and Trulli made contact, causing the former to spin. Webber then overtook Barrichello for fourth and Michael Schumacher did the same on his teammate soon after for fifth. Ralf Schumacher began to recover lost positions with an overtake on Villeneuve for tenth on the 12th lap. At the front of the field, Räikkönen had increased his lead over Montoya to five seconds by lap 14. On the same lap, Montoya reported a loss of rear tyre grip to his team over the radio and ran wide leaving Juncao turn. Coulthard overtook Montoya for second.

As the circuit began to dry, except for turn three which continued to have water stream across it, Coulthard began to close up to his teammate Räikkönen, as Michael Schumacher overtook Webber on the inside for fourth on lap 15 leaving Arquibancdas turn. On the 16th lap, Michael Schumacher moved into third position with a pass on the slower Montoya around the outside at the Bico de Pato corner. Wilson drove through a river at the Curva do Sol turn and aquaplaned off another on the following lap. He retired after he was unable to restart his car. Coulthard drew close enough to his teammate Räikkönen by the 18th lap, just as Barrichello moved past Webber for fifth place. That same lap, Firman&#x27;s right-front suspension system failed going into the braking area on the start/finish straight, causing him to lose control of his car and his flailing right-front wheel narrowly avoided striking its cockpit. He narrowly avoided a collision with his teammate Fisichella, struck the rear of Panis&#x27;s car at almost . Panis&#x27;s rear wing was removed and the front of Firman&#x27;s car sustained damage.

The safety car was deployed for the second time for debris clearing. Several drivers took the opportunity to make pit stops for fuel and tyres. Montoya avoided a collision with Trulli and Alonso stopped twice since he had the incorrect tyres installed on his car. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap 22 and Räikkönen closed the field up to maintain the lead from Coulthard, Michael Schumacher and the yet-to-stop Da Matta. On the Reta Oposta straight, Barrichello overtook Da Matta for fourth on lap 23, as a driver error dropped Frentzen from eighth to sixteenth and Ralf Schumacher passed Verstappen for eleventh. Montoya overtook Da Matta for fifth and Ralf Schumacher moved past Button for ninth during lap 24. On the 25th lap, Montoya aquaplaned at the Curva do Sol and crashed into a right-hand side barrier. Pizzonia hit the water stream flowing across the circuit at the same corner and aquaplaned. He collided with the wall, ricocheted off it and struck Montoya&#x27;s car. The accidents elevated Da Matta to fifth and Webber to sixth. By lap 26, Alonso had passed Villeneuve and Fisichella to move to tenth.

Lap 27 saw the third safety car deployment: Michael Schumacher aquaplaned off the stream of water at the Curva do Sol turn and avoided hitting a recovery crane extricating Montoya and Pizzonia&#x27;s vehicles from the side of the track. He stopped on a run-off area and failed to finish a race for the first time since the 2001 German Grand Prix. Räikkönen and Da Matta made their pit stops for fuel under safety car conditions. Coulthard took the lead and maintained it at the lap 30 restart. Räikkönen overtook Fisichella and Verstappen to return to seventh position and Da Matta passed Frentzen. On the 31st lap, Verstappen aquaplaned on the stream of water at the Curva do Sol corner and retired. The water caught out Button on lap 33: he lost control of his vehicle and crashed heavily against the barrier. Button was unhurt. The accident necessitated the safety car&#x27;s fourth deployment. In the meantime, his teammate Villeneuve spun and fell behind Frentzen and Trulli. During the safety car period, Da Matta made a pit stop to correct a technical problem. At the lap 37 restart, Da Matta and Webber passed Villeneuve.

Räikkönen overtook Alonso on the start/finish straight into the Senna S chicane for fourth on the 38th lap. Further round the lap, he passed Ralf Schumacher on the outside line going into the Descida do Lago corner. Frentzen in eighth was overtaken by Webber and Villeneuve re-passed Da Matta for tenth during the same lap. On lap 40, Alonso steered to the inside to extract additional grip and passed Ralf Schumacher at Mergulho turn for fourth position. As Barrichello gained on race leader Coulthard, the stewards informed Renault on the 42nd lap that Alonso had been issued a drive-through penalty because he was deemed to have overtaken Ralf Schumacher under yellow flag conditions. He took the penalty on the same lap and fell from fourth to ninth. On the 44th lap, Webber lost control of the rear of his car at the Curva do Sol corner and spun through 360 degrees. He avoided contact with the barrier and merged onto the track after Frentzen, Alonso and Villeneuve passed him.

At the front of the field, Coulthard (on worn tyres) ran wide on the approach to the Senna S chicane and Barrichello used the driver error to pass him for first position on lap 45. Barrichello began to pull away from Coulthard, extending his lead to 4.2 seconds by lap 46&#x27;s conclusion, who in turn, was 15 seconds ahead of his teammate Räikkönen. On lap 47, Barrichello pulled off at the side of the circuit to retire from the event for the ninth consecutive year, causing the first Ferrari&#x27;s double withdrawal since the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix. A fuel feed problem was suspected to have caused Barrichello&#x27;s retirement until it was traced to a malfunctioning in-car computer calculating it had more fuel than normal and an error with Ferrari&#x27;s telemetry did not inform the team he had run out of fuel. Coulthard returned to the lead, eighteen seconds ahead of his teammate Räikkönen in second and Fisichella third. By the 48th lap, drivers became concerned over fuel. Ralf Schumacher made a pit stop and rejoined in ninth. Alonso and Frentzen overtook Trulli and demoted him to sixth during laps 49 and 50. On the 52nd lap, Coulthard made a pit stop for tyres after a minor loss of car control through Juncao corner and the start/finish straight. He rejoined the race in fourth position. Räikkönen retook the lead with the faster Fisichella second and Alonso third. On lap 54, a lack of tyre grip caused Räikkönen to understeer on the approach to the Mergulho turn and Fisichella passed him for the lead. Both drivers were borderline on fuel and it appeared Coulthard would return to the lead and win the event. At Arquibancadas corner, Webber attempted to prevent his tyres from overheating wherever possible and lost car grip on lap 54. He lost control of his car, and crashed heavily against the concrete barriers on each side of the circuit before the start/finish straight at . Debris from Webber&#x27;s car and three of its tyres were strewn across the track and causing the safety car&#x27;s fifth deployment. Webber clambered from his car unhurt.

Fisichella and Räikkönen negotiated their way through the debris and the latter entered the pit lane to stop for fuel. Alonso did not notice the waved yellow flags informing him of a hazard, because he was discussing whether to use dry or wet tyres with Renault over the radio. He hit one of Webber&#x27;s detached rear wheels at around in an impact measured at . Alonso veered left and struck a tyre wall at lateral and longitudinal. The car was launched broadside across the circuit and into a concrete barrier at . Alonso sustained a bruised left elbow, knee and thigh, a group of medical personnel placed him on a stretcher for transport by ambulance to the Saint Louis Hospital in São Paulo for observation.

Because of a large amount of debris, personnel tending to Alonso, and 75% of the race distance covered, race continuation behind the safety car was impossible. The race ended early with a red flag after leader Fisichella finished lap 55, and all cars subsequently returned to the pit lane. Fisichella&#x27;s car overheated because the safety car was slow and fire emerged from the engine bay as he stopped in &quot;parc fermé&quot;, The sporting regulations stated that the race would be &quot;deemed to have finished when the leading car crossed the line at the end of the lap two laps prior to that lap during which the signal to stop was given&quot; in the event more than 75% of it was completed. The official timekeeping screens first showed that Fisichella had begun his 56th lap; then this status briefly disappeared and displayed it as on his 55th. The race stewards based their decision on the belief Fisichella was still on his 55th lap. Fisichella celebrated with the Jordan team in the belief he had won before they were informed Räikkönen had won; Räikkönen was informed while being weighed. Alonso was third, Coulthard fourth, the non-stopping Frentzen fifth, Villeneuve sixth, Webber seventh (notwithstanding his crash) and Trulli eighth. Ralf Schumacher and Da Matta (who had oversteer) were the final provisional finishers.

===Post-race===

Because Alonso was in hospital, Räikkönen and Fisichella appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Räikkönen believed he was lucky to be awarded the victory: &quot;I think that it came so quickly that we didn&#x27;t make the decision quickly enough but in the end it was the right decision, so thanks to the team. It was a difficult race because the conditions were so bad and the safety car was out so often, but I&#x27;m pretty happy.&quot; Fisichella said he was disappointed with the race&#x27;s situation: &quot;first of all for Fernando, I hope that he&#x27;s alright and then also because I won the race but the rules say that when there is a red flag, the result is taken from one lap before (two laps in fact) so I am very sorry about that but I never thought I would finish in second position so it&#x27;s a great day anyway.&quot;

Alonso received messages of well-being from the public and rally driver Carlos Sainz. He was discharged from hospital after 12 hours, and returned to Madrid on the morning of 8 April to begin physical therapy for the following . Alonso commented on the accident: &quot;I thought my race was going pretty well. But then I came round the final corner to find debris everywhere and I had nowhere to go. I think I hit a wheel, and the next thing I knew I was headed for the barriers.&quot; He attributed the HANS device for preventing him from sustaining more serious injuries. Webber was not required to take a medical test and performed 60 push-ups to persuade his physiotherapist he had suffered no long-term complications from his crash. He called it &quot;the biggest accident I&#x27;ve had in a Formula One car&quot; and revealed his neck and knees took most of the force from the impact: &quot;I haven&#x27;t been in a race that crazy before and it&#x27;s the most damage I&#x27;ve done to a Formula One car. I&#x27;ve knocked two corners off before but nothing like this.&quot;

Alonso and Michael Schumacher&#x27;s crashes put them at risk of FIA sanctioning. An FIA observer reported Schumacher and Alonso to the governing body; the stewards could not question Alonso in Brazil as he was hospitalised. Schumacher was interviewed by Whiting at the San Marino Grand Prix pre-event drivers&#x27; meeting on 17 April. Two days later, Alonso and Schumacher met with Whiting individually; he cautioned the two over their future driving standards and did not further reprimand them.

Villeneuve said he felt the drivers and not the track conditions contributed to unsafe racing: &quot;It is down to the drivers to be less crazy in those conditions and there was some crazy driving out there. Some drivers were overtaking under the yellow flags, halfway through the race I saw Alonso overtake under the flags. I think that is the kind of driving that leads to big accidents.&quot; After his first race retirement since the 2001 German Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher stated he was unworried over the possibility of him winning his sixth World Drivers&#x27; Championship: &quot;In terms of the championship, obviously it would have been better for us if Fisichella had won the race in Brazil instead of Raikkonen, especially as Giancarlo drove a good race anyway. But the gap to the championship leader is not so big, given there are still 13 races, so there is no need to be concerned about it.&quot; Barrichello said he would continue to strive to win the Brazilian Grand Prix and was frustrated to learn a fuel problem caused his retirement: &quot;I feel an enormous disappointment but I am not losing hope. I will not stop racing until I win in this country.&quot;

Coulthard said he was annoyed with himself for making a pit stop before the red flags were shown because he believed he could have won the race had he not done so: &quot;I am going away from here without a Grand Prix win that I worked hard for. I believe I have more claim on that victory than other people. I&#x27;d done my final stop of the race and I know the three guys in front of me all had to come in again if the race had not been stopped.&quot; Frentzen lauded Sauber&#x27;s decision to change its strategy that saw him start the event in the team&#x27;s spare car: &quot;At the end of the day it turned out to be the right decision. It was not easy to run with a full tank and I had a lot of aquaplaning which made me spin once. But we finished fifth and scored four points, so I am very happy about this result.&quot; Paul Stoddart, the Minardi team owner, claimed they could have taken victory had both its cars been running: &quot;Today saw possibly the first time ever that Minardi was potentially in a genuine, race-winning position. Many people may laugh, but only those of us within the team will ever know the truth. We had the strategy, but not the luck.&quot;

===Timekeeping error===
After he flew to London from Brazil on the morning of 8 April, Whiting launched an internal investigation into the result of the race because FIA officials were unhappy at the timesheets provided to the governing body by Formula One&#x27;s timekeepers TAG Heuer. He was concerned about a possible timekeeping error and asked representatives from TAG Heuer and the three race stewards for the Brazilian Grand Prix, to attend a meeting at the FIA headquarters in Paris on the morning of 11 April as part of compliance with &quot;Article 179 (b) of the International Sporting Code.&quot;

Oral arguments and timing evidence were presented to a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) court in Paris, which, on 11 April, awarded victory to Fisichella. McLaren declined to file an appeal. This was Fisichella&#x27;s first Formula One win. It was the last Grand Prix win for a car with a Ford engine and for Jordan as a constructor. An unofficial ceremony was held during the next race weekend at Imola, where Räikkönen and Ron Dennis handed over the winning driver&#x27;s and constructor&#x27;s trophies to Fisichella and Eddie Jordan.

<text>The Ontario Film Review Board () is an inactive agency of the government of the Canadian province of Ontario that was formerly responsible for that province&#x27;s motion picture rating system. Until 2015, the board reported to the Minister of Consumer Services but as of 1 October 2015, the board was overseen by the Ontario Film Authority. The board&#x27;s activities were based on the &quot;Film Classification Act, 2005&quot;.

The Ontario Film Review Board ceased operation as of 1 October 2019, with responsibility for film classification being transferred from the Ontario Film Authority, which is to be wound down, and the Ontario Film Review Board to the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. Films were briefly deemed to have the same classification as those given by the British Columbia Film Classification Office, and adult films will be cleared for screening in Ontario if they have been approved by any jurisdiction in Canada. Ratings are now no longer required for movies to be shown in Ontario.

==History==
A three-person Board of Censors was established on 27 June 1911 following passage of the &quot;Theatres and Cinematographs Act, 1911&quot;. The initial members were Chair George E. Armstrong, Robert Wilson and Otter Elliott. From that point, films to be shown in Ontario legally required review and approval by the board. The Board&#x27;s censorship authority included newsreels, for example footage from a 1937 General Motors strike was banned &quot;to avoid propaganda by either side.&quot;

The Board of Censors began to provide basic film classifications from 1 June 1946, initially as a year-long pilot project to designate certain films which were deemed inappropriate for children. Theatre operators were required to identify such films as &quot;adult entertainment&quot; on marquees and advertising. &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; and &quot;Her Kind of Man&quot; were among the first films to be identified as adult entertainment in Ontario.

Further changes to the &quot;Theatres Act&quot; in 1975 empowered what was now known as the Ontario Censor Board to review and censor videotapes and 8 mm film formats as well as conventional theatrical films. In the late 1970s and early 80s the Board was involved in a number of high-profile disputes with the Toronto International Film Festival (known then as the Festival of Festivals) over the Board&#x27;s refusal to approve some films for screening without cuts, and for banning other films outright. In 1977, the board ordered cuts from the film &quot;Je, tu, il, elle&quot; which depicted two women having sex; the Festival pulled the film from its programme. In 1978, it demanded a 38-second cut from a love scene in &quot;In Praise of Older Women&quot;; director Robert Lantos agreed but at the last minute substituted the uncut version of the film. The screening was introduced by federal Secretary of State for Canada John Roberts who publicly denounced the board, telling the audience at the Elgin Theatre that “because of the actions of the Ontario censor it is time for an active affirmation that censors shouldn’t tell people what they should or should not see.” In 1982, the board refused to approve Pierre Rissient’s &quot;Cinq et la peau&quot;; instead of substituting another film, festival organizers protested the ban by posting a sign outside the theatre explaining why the screen was being kept dark.

The board&#x27;s high profile actions against various films being screened at the festival had the unintended effect of raising their profile and audience interest. According to former festival director Helga Stephenson, “Silly old [Ontario Censor Board chairman] Mary Brown filled some theatres with some pretty tame stuff. The ranting and raving was a very good way to get the festival into the minds of the public, but internationally it was hugely embarrassing. And it filled the theatre with the wrong people, because they came looking for nothing but blow jobs, and they found themselves in the middle of a long, hard, boring film waiting for a few seconds of a grainy image showing something that looked vaguely like a male sex organ.”

In 1985, the name of the board was changed to the Ontario Film Review Board after the provincial government amended the &quot;Theatres Act&quot;. The Board composition changed from full-time civil servants to part-time members of the public. In 1988 festival films became exempt from review by the board provided the audience was limited to those eighteen and over.

In 2005, the original and much amended &quot;Theatres Act&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Film Classification Act&quot;.

In 2013, the Ontario Film Authority was incorporated. It entered into an agreement with the Minister of Consumer Services dated 5 May 2014. On 1 October 2015, an amendment to Ontario Regulation 187/09 came into effect, providing that the Ontario Film Authority is the sole administrative authority for the purpose of administering all provisions of the &quot;Film Classification Act, 2005&quot; and the regulations made under that Act.

This restructuring of administrative oversight in 2015 was &quot;part of a larger provincial initiative to streamline more than 200 boards and commissions&quot;, according to &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;.

===Censored film cases===
Significant cases have occurred where a film was either banned outright in Ontario, or certain scenes were ordered removed:

* 1926: &quot;Moana&quot; - the censor board would not approve this film unless 300 feet, or about 4% of the footage, was removed. The depiction of topless Samoan women in the production was cited as the cause for this censorship. The film was defended by artist Arthur Heming and others, while it was approved by film review authorities in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
* 1940: &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreel episode &quot;Canada At War&quot; was banned until the 1940 federal election was completed, as Premier Mitchell Hepburn charged that the production was &quot;pure political propaganda for the Mackenzie King Government&quot;. The newsreel was allowed in Quebec where cinemas in Hull, Quebec reported significant audience levels.
* 1978: &quot;In Praise of Older Women&quot; - The Board requested a two-minute cut from this federally funded and Canadian made film, showing as the festival opener at the Toronto Film Festival. The cut was negotiated down to 38 seconds, but most sources claim an uncut version was shown at the festival. The offending scene was simulated sexual activity.
* 1978: &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; - The film was fully banned from Ontario as it depicted a prostitute who was a minor.
* 1980: &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; - Specific scenes were ordered deleted before the film could be shown in Ontario. The director and distributor initially refused to edit the film but eventually agreed to a compromise where the film would be distributed with fewer cuts than originally ordered.
* 2000: &quot;Baise-moi&quot; - This film originally played uncut at the Toronto Film Festival. When it was rated for general release, it was banned due to excessive explicit sexual content. The distributor resubmitted the film for consideration as an adult sex film, but it was banned due to sexual violence. Eventually the film was approved and rated R, after a small cut.
* 2001: &quot;Fat Girl&quot; - The Film Review Board ordered deletion of scenes from most of the film&#x27;s 93-minute length, effectively banning the production. Scenes of sexuality involving a 13-year-old character were cited. The film&#x27;s distributors filed an appeal with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, but the Film Review Board reconsidered and passed the film intact for Ontario audiences before the appeal could be heard.

Several sources claim the Board banned the NFB anti-pornography documentary &quot;Not a Love Story.&quot; The Board was asked to rate this film, along with three others, submitted by a group of artists, known as the Ontario Film and Video Appreciation Society (OFVAS). The Board refused to view or rate &quot;Not a Love Story&quot; on the grounds that OFVAS did not own the film or have any distribution rights. Ratings were provided on the other films. The artists then took the Board to court over the ratings given, and the refusal to rate &quot;Not a Love Story.&quot; The Board&#x27;s actions were challenged under the new Canadian Constitution.

The Ontario Divisional Court ruled in 1983 that film classification and censorship were justifiable under the Constitution. The court also determined that three of the Board&#x27;s rulings were valid. Approval with time and place restrictions in the case of &quot;The Art of Worldly Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Rameau&#x27;s Nephew&quot; was considered a &quot;valid exercise of the Board&#x27;s power.&quot; The Board&#x27;s refusal to review &quot;Not A Love Story: A Film About Pornography&quot; was acceptable as the Board did not need to perform hypothetical reviews. The film had not been submitted for commercial distribution, and the judge noted &quot;the applicants were seeking permission to show a film they did not own and which they had no right to exhibit.&quot; Concerning the Board&#x27;s ban of the fourth film, &quot;Amerika&quot;, the court ruled that the Board had no legally defined rights to determine what the public could view. The government appealed to the Ontario Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed in 1984. The government subsequently added regulations to define the Board`s powers.

<text>Carl Edmond Stewart (born January 2, 1950) is a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. He was appointed by Bill Clinton in 1994, and previously sat as a judge of the Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal from 1985 to 1994.

==Background==

Stewart was born to Corine, a maid and Richard Stewart, a postal worker, in Shreveport. As a teenager in the 1960s, Stewart witnessed the civil rights struggle of the era, and saw how the legal system could be used to bring about positive social change. Stewart was inspired by what he saw and decided to dedicate his life to helping people through the legal system. He graduated from Dillard University in New Orleans with a Bachelor of Arts degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1971 and earned his Juris Doctor from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law in 1974.

In 1974, Stewart entered the U.S. Army in the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps. As a captain, he served as a defense attorney for soldiers at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. After an honorable discharge in 1977, Stewart worked as an associate in a small private law firm. He joined a field office of the Louisiana Attorney General in 1978.

In 1979, Stewart became an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, and worked on a wide variety of cases. He prosecuted a loan shark who preyed on the poor, a sheriff who paid for votes during a reelection bid, and an unscrupulous land owner who filed false flood relief claims with the federal government. Stewart received a letter of commendation from the Justice Department for his work on a civil rights case in 1982 and 1983.
Stewart left the Justice Department in 1983 to go into private practice in Shreveport, and work as an adjunct professor at Louisiana State University. In 1985, he won election to a six year term as a district judge in Louisiana&#x27;s First Judicial District Court. At the conclusion of the term, Stewart was elected to the position on the state&#x27;s Second Circuit Court of Appeal from 1991 to 1994.

==Federal judicial service==

Stewart sat on the First Judicial District Court from 1985 to 1991 and the Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1991 to 1994. Stewart was nominated by President Bill Clinton on January 27, 1994, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 104 Stat. 5089. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 6, 1994, and received commission on May 9, 1994. He served as Chief Judge from 2012 to 2019.

== Personal life ==

Stewart is married to Jo Ann Southall Stewart, a registered nurse who works with school children who have substance abuse problems. They have three children. Stewart&#x27;s two brothers also are distinguished attorneys: Captain Richard G. Stewart Jr. is a Force Judge Advocate in the U.S. Navy, and Retired Judge James E. Stewart Sr. who is now the District Attorney of Caddo Parish. Stewart is also a lay leader of the Louisiana United Methodist Conference.

<doc id="1123514" wikidata="Q181046" url="?curid=1123514" title="Jorge Dely Valdés">
<text>Jorge Luis Dely Valdés (born March 12, 1967) is a Panamanian former footballer who played as a forward. He is a twin brother of Julio Dely Valdés and younger brother of Armando Dely Valdés.

== Club career ==
Born in Colon, Dely Valdés began his professional career in 1989 in Argentina with Deportivo Paraguayo of Argentina, where he scored 28 goals. A move to El Porvenir for the 1990 season did not prove successful, as a leg injury kept him out most of the season, and he moved to Nacional of Uruguay the next season, where he won the Uruguayan Championship in 1992. In the next year, he won the Chilean Cup championship with Unión Española.

Dely Valdés then moved to the Japan Football League, where he played with Toshiba. In his first season, 1993, he led the Japan Football scoring table with 20 goals, and improved that in 1994, again leading the league with 34. Delys Valdés was transferred to Cerezo Osaka for the 1995 season, and continued his dominance, scoring 19 goals. In the subsequent season he moved to Tosu Futures, where he scored 24 goals. For the 1998 season, Dely Valdés was signed by a Japan Football League club, Consadole Sapporo, looking to return to the first division; Jorge helped the team do just that, by scoring 40 goals in leading the team back. Dely Valdés remained with Sapporo in 1999, scoring 20 goals that season. He left them after the 1998 season.

Dely Valdés returned to CONCACAF following the 1999 J. League season to play in Major League Soccer for the Colorado Rapids. Dely Valdés continued his scoring rate in the 1999 MLS season, registering 10 goals and 6 assists in 32 games for the Rapids. He continued to score in 2000, registering another 7 goals and 1 assist in 20 games, 13 starts, for the Rapids.

He returned to Japan to play for Omiya Ardija alongside compatriot Alfredo Anderson and joined Kawasaki Frontale in 2003.

== International career ==
Jorge was a very dangerous striker for the Panama national team for over a decade, playing 27 games with the team in the 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Cup Qualifying cycles. He made his debut in a May 1991 UNCAF Nations Cup match against Honduras and earned a total of 48 caps, scoring 19 goals. He represented his country at the 1995 and 2001 UNCAF Nations Cups.

In the Gold Cup of 2005, he scored two goals and led Panama to the final match against the United States.

His final international was an October 2005 FIFA World Cup qualification match against the United States.

== Managerial career ==
On August 8, 2014, he took over as manager at Tauro in his native Panama, a position he held until leaving on December 30, 2014 to join his brother Julio at Águila in El Salvador. He returned to Tauro in May 2015, only to be replaced by Rolando Palma in October 2015.

As coach of U-20 Panama, he managed to write history for the country by helping the national team to win the first ever match in the FIFA U-20 World Cup, a 2–1 victory over Asian champions U-20 Saudi Arabia in 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup and qualified to the round of sixteen for the first time ever in Panamanian history of the U-20 World Cup.

<doc id="1123516" wikidata="Q5094861" url="?curid=1123516" title="Chhayavad">
<text>Chhayavad (ISO: ) refers to the era of mystical-romanticism in Hindi literature, particularly poetry, spanning approximately from mid-1910s to early-1940s. It emerged as a reaction to the didacticism of its previous poetic movement - the Dwivedi era - as well as the courtly traditions of poetry.

It was marked by a renewed sense of the self and personal expression with an increase in romantic and humanist content. It is known for its leaning towards themes of love and nature, as well as an individualistic reappropriation in a new form of mysticism.

The movement is typically attributed to Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Sumitranandan Pant, and Mahadevi Varma, often cited as the four pillars of Chāyāvād. Their writings reflected a conscious blending of classical Indian heritage with occidental sensibilities. The movement delved into love as a spiritual and transformative force, reverence for nature as a source of solace, and the individual’s quest for identity and connection with the divine. These themes incorporated traditional values with the evolving ideas of freedom and self-expression during the country’s struggle for independence.

It is characterized by a lyrical, poetic, and musical accomplishment of modern Hindi literature. Anchored in new sensibilities, it concluded with the rise of the experimental spirit of &quot;Prayogvad&quot; and the socially engaged &quot;Pragativad&quot;, together reflecting the dynamic evolution of Hindi poetry in the early 20th century.

==Eytmology==
The literal meaning of &quot;chāyā&quot; carries various interpretations, including shade, such as from a tree or cloud; reflection, like that in a mirror; and shadow, as cast by an object.

The term chāyā appears in the Upanishads, where it refers to the universe as a phenomenal reflection of transcendental reality. This interpretation is supported by the broader intellectual environment of that time, when figures like Vivekananda and Rabindranath Tagore were revisiting the Upanishads and introducing modern interpretations of ancient texts.

Researchers have also proposed that the term may be associated with the reflection of the literary expression exemplified in Tagore&#x27;s Gitanjali which itself was influenced by Romanticism of English literature.

The first use of the term chāyāvād in the context of Hindi poetry is attributed to Mukutdhar Pandey, who introduced it through his collection of essays in 1920. Namvar Singh notes that the essays were presented with annotations, suggesting that commentaries on this poetic style already existed. Scholars agree that the essence of chāyāvād&#x27; began to take shape around the mid-1910s, predating its formal recognition in 1920.

==Historical Context==
===Development===

Until the early 20th century, Hindi poetry followed traditions that had developed over several centuries through various medieval literary forms and dialects. The first attempts at modern standardized Hindi poetry, based on &quot;Khari Boli&quot;, emerged during a surge of literary activity in Varanasi in the 1860s, centered around Bharatendu Harishchandra. It was primarily characterized by &quot;bhakti&quot; (religious devotion) or &quot;riti&quot; (courtly love) themes. The Bhartendu yug introduced innovations, such as using verses in Braj Bhasha for dramas to comment on contemporary issues, but these did not gain lasting traction.

A significant shift in Hindi poetry occurred with the founding of the magazine &quot;Sarasvatī&quot; in 1900, under the editorship of Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi. While initially appreciated more for its social and literary goals than for its aesthetic value, the Dwivedi yug marked a transformation in the content of Hindi poetry. Poets of this era moved away from the limited scope of &quot;rītī&quot; poetry and began addressing themes such as nationalism and social reform. A defining work of this period is Maithilisharan Gupt’s 1912 poem &quot;Bhārat-Bhāratī&quot;, which exemplifies the nationalist sentiment of the time. Dwivedi-era introduced didactic themes that shaped the discourse of Hindi literature through the second and third decades of the 20th century.

Simultaneously, a younger generation of poets emerged on the fringes of the literary establishment, rejecting both the ideal prosaic moral earnestness of Dwivedi-era poetry and the narrow scope of &quot;rītī&quot; traditions. Their reaction against earlier styles and themes led to a revolution in poetic sensibility, ultimately giving rise to the Chhayavad yug.

===Period===
The Chhayawad period is generally dated between 1918 and 1938, though some critics and scholars propose slight variations for its inception. This period of literary flourishing coincided with the aftermath of World War I, and extended through the interwar years, culminating in the early 1940s as World War II commenced. Hence, this poetic stream aligns with global trends of introspection, and cultural revival in post-war societies. The Chhayawad era also coincided with India&#x27;s escalating struggle for independence, intertwining personal emotions with the collective aspirations for cultural identity and an implicit desire for political independence.

Prominent critic Ramchandra Shukla in his &quot;Hindi Sahitya ka Itihas&quot; asserts that: 

Hazari Prasad Dwivedi asserted that Chāyāvād stemmed from an inward orientation of the mind and a steadfast belief in the changing human condition. The poets of this era were endowed with exceptional sensitivity and keen awareness of social disparities and discord. Stylistically, they were markedly distinct from their predecessors, focusing primarily on subjectivity. By 1920, Khadi Boli poetry still emphasized themes, but subsequently, the poet’s own emotions and sentiments took precedence. The significance of the theme itself became secondary, while the poet’s inner resonance with it became paramount.

Namwar Singh wrote: 

Nand Dulare Bajpai defined Chāyāvād as the subtle yet manifest beauty of nature imbued with a spiritual aura, offering a universally accepted explanation of the movement.

===By the contributing poets===
Jaishankar Prasad noted that this new form of poetry relied more on Indian aesthetics of experience and expression. Its distinctive features included suggestiveness, figurativeness, the depiction of nature, and the nuanced articulation of personal emotions. He said:

Mahadevi Varma viewed the philosophy of Chhayavad as rooted in universalism (sarvātmavād) and identified nature as its medium. She believed this poetry established a profound emotional bond with nature, evoking universal empathy and unity with all elements of the world. She regarded mysticism as a natural progression of Chāyāvād.

Sumitranandan Pant considered Chāyāvād to be influenced by Western Romanticism.

==Literary Characterstics==
===Poetry===
One of the central themes is the profound connection between humans and nature. The natural world is often depicted as a mirror reflecting human emotions, with the elements of the earth, sky, and seasons, as in Pant&#x27;s &quot;Gramya&quot; and &quot;Gunjan&quot; serving as metaphors for internal states of being. In this regard, nature becomes both a symbol of the poet’s emotional experiences and a vehicle for spiritual transcendence.

Another key theme is the idealization of love and the romantic quest for the eternal, most prominent in the poems of Mahadevi. She frequently portrayed love as a divine force, representing the ideal of untainted beauty and connection, transcending the physical realm.

Spirituality and mysticism are also prevalent themes, with an emphasis on the search for truth, self-realization, and the connection between the individual and the divine. The movement was also marked by an engagement with the existential concerns of human life. Poets explored the duality of existence, such as life and death, material and spiritual worlds, and the transient nature of time, as evident in works of like &quot;Saroj Smriti&quot;, &quot;Sneh nirjhar (Nirala)&quot;, and &quot;Aansu&quot; (Prasad). This theme is often reflected through melancholic expressions, contemplating the impermanence of life and the inevitability of death.

===Prose===
Although Chāyāvād is primarily associated with poetry, it is noteworthy that all the prominent figures also made significant contributions to prose. Interestingly, much of their prose, both in style and more so in the time-period, aligns with the essence of Chāyāvād. For instance, Prasad&#x27;s historical plays, Nirala&#x27;s story collections, and Mahadevi&#x27;s distinctive memoirs reflect this connection. Beyond this, themes of nationalism and freedom—both personal and political—are evident in works like &quot;Kankal&quot; (Prasad), &quot;Kulli Bhat&quot; (Nirala), &quot;Shrinkhla ki Kadiyan&quot; (Mahadevi), and Pant&#x27;s essay collections. The prose of this era predominantly embodied nationalistic and emotional fervor, in contrast to the mystical and romantic themes characteristic of its poetry.

== Notable authors ==
Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi &#x27;Nirala&#x27;, Sumitranandan Pant and Mahadevi Varma are considered as the four pillars of the &quot;Chhayavadi&quot; school of Hindi literature.

=== Jaishankar Prasad ===
Prasad was born in 1889 in Varanasi into a prosperous family with a strong association to Shaivism. His family’s enterprise was focused on the trade of snuff and tobacco. His early education began at home, studying Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian, and Urdu, before he got enrolled at Queen&#x27;s College.

He had a deep interest in religion, history, archaeology, and gardening. Music was a lifelong inclination, and he appreciated both classical forms and lighter styles. His works often include love in its diverse forms, the profound exploration of pain and anguish, the complexities of the human condition, the pursuit of spiritual ideals, and the examination of historical and mythological narratives—elements that are evident in both his poetry and prose. 

=== Suryakant Tripathi &#x27;Nirala&#x27; ===
Nirala was born towards the end of the 19th century at Mahishadal in Midnapore in Bengal Presidency. He independently started deciphering the grammar of modern standard Hindi by studying two Hindi journals available to him in Bengal: &quot;Sarasvatī&quot; and &quot;Maryādā&quot;.

He revolutionized Hindi poetry by pioneering the use of free verse. Nirala&#x27;s poetry illustrated a profound connection with the living spirits of nature. His mystical poems, rich with the devotion of medieval Bhakti poetry, explored nature within a metaphysical framework that aligned with his Advaita beliefs. Themes of minority subjectivity, social critique, and social upliftment also appeared frequently in his writings.

=== Sumitranandan Pant ===
Pant was born in Kausani in 1900. He grew up in a village and always cherished a love for the beauty and flavor of rural India, which is reflected in all his major works. He was known for romanticism in his poems which were inspired by nature, people and beauty within.

His works showcase a blend of innovation and emotional depth, marked by free verse and prose poems. Renowned for his vivid imagery, rhythmic variety, and charm, his contributions extend beyond poetry, highlighting his brilliance as a prose stylist, essayist, and critic.

=== Mahadevi Varma ===
Verma was born on 26 March 1907 in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh. She significantly impacted Hindi literature by refining the language and infusing poetry with heartfelt acceptance of Indian philosophy.

Her unique blend of emotional intensity, lyrical simplicity, and evocative imagery, along with her contributions as a translator and scholar, solidified her position as a leading figure of the Chhayavad movement. Her poetry, along with her work towards social upliftment and women&#x27;s education, were depicted in her writings. These works greatly influenced both readers and critics.

===Others=== 
Other important figures of this literary movement were Ramdhari Singh &#x27;Dinkar&#x27;, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Ramkumar Verma and Pandit Narendra Sharma.

== Notable works ==
Some of the important works of this school include:
*Jaishankar Prasad&#x27;s &quot;Kamayani&quot; (1936), and &quot;Aansu&quot;
* Nirala&#x27;s anthologies like &quot;Anamika&quot; (featuring iconic poems such as &quot;Ram Ki Shakti Puja&quot; and Saroj Smriti), &quot;Parimal&quot;, &quot;Naye Patte&quot;, and long poem &quot;Tulsidas&quot; 
*Mahadevi&#x27;s &quot;Rashmi&quot;, &quot;Neerja&quot;, &quot;Deepshikha&quot;, and &quot;Sandhyageet&quot;
* Pant&#x27;s &quot;Pallav&quot; and &quot;Gunjan&quot;
*Bachchan&#x27;s &quot;Madhushala&quot;

== Reception ==
Initially, Chhayavad was very well received by readers and critics alike. However, subsequent scholars have criticized Chhayavad for excessive use of decorative language, romanticism aloof from contemporary social and economic malaise, and setting stricter rules on meter and rhyme.

Harivansh Rai Bachchan became excessively critical of Chhayavad later in his career and was associated with other genres like &quot;Pragativaad&quot;.

Chhayavad continued until the latter half of the 1930s, when the golden era of modern Hindi poetry was gradually replaced by social didacticism inspired by rising nationalist fervour. Some of the later poets of this era, like Dinkar, Mahadevi and Bachchan took nationalist and social critiquing within their poetry.

<doc id="1123520" wikidata="Q372411" url="?curid=1123520" title="Ahmad Fanakati">
<text>Ahmad Fanākatī, alternatively rendered as Ahmad Banākatī (; ; before 1242 — 10 April 1282) was a Persian Muslim from the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty) who served as chancellor and finance minister of the Yuan dynasty during Kublai&#x27;s reign. He became known as a chief minister under Kublai and is credited with successfully establishing the financial system of the Yuan dynasty. He was considered to be a &quot;villainous minister&quot; in dynastic histories because of his perceived corruption.

==Life and career==
Ahmad Fanākatī came from Fanākat (or Banākat), a town on the upper Syr Darya in Central Asia, under the rule of the Qara Khitai until they were conquered by the Mongol Empire.

Ahmad obtained employment under Kublai through Empress Jamui Khatun, who had known him before her marriage. To her court he was originally attached but was already in high financial office in 1264.

Trusted by Chabi Khatun, Kublai&#x27;s favorite wife, Ahmad was entrusted with state finances in 1262. He was successful in managing the financial affairs of Northern China and brought huge tax revenues to Kublai&#x27;s new government. In 1270, he assumed the full power of the new financial department known as the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng), which had equal status with the administrative department known as the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng). After the conquest of the Song dynasty in 1276, he entered the financial matters of Southern China. He prepared a state monopoly in salt, which came to account for a large portion of state income. In his 20-year term of office, he created his strong faction with his clan and Muslims from Central Asia.

Ahmad&#x27;s tax system gained a bad reputation from the Chinese because it was ruthlessly operated and considerably differed from traditional Chinese systems. Ahmad was reputed for his rapaciousness. He abused his position to gather riches for himself.

Marco Polo recorded his name as &quot;Bailo Acmat (Achmac)&quot;. He mentions that Ahmad had 25 sons and accumulated great wealth.

In 1271, the Department of State Affairs was absorbed into the Central Secretariat. While holding the financial affairs, he started intervening in state administration. It heightened tension with the rival faction that included Crown Prince Zhenjin, Antong, the head of the Central Secretariat and other Mongol aristocrats, and Chinese bureaucrats. The death of his political patron Chabi Khatun in 1281 made the situation critical; Ahmad was assassinated by Wang Zhu and Gao Heshang (Kao Ho-chang) in the next year and his faction fell from power.

Although Ahmad&#x27;s assassins were executed, after Kublai Khan heard all the complaints about Ahmad&#x27;s corruption from his enemies, Kublai then ordered Ahmad&#x27;s body to be taken from his tomb and desecrated by being eaten by dogs, and then using chariot wheels to smash the bones to pieces.

Kublai also ordered Ahmad&#x27;s sons to be put to death.

==Influence==
Ahmad is usually portrayed as an evil bureaucrat in traditional Chinese records: his corruption and tyranny are emphasized. In contrast, the &quot;Jami al-Tawarikh&quot; positively evaluates his assistance to Kublai&#x27;s administration. The recent Mongolian studies also tend to make positive reference to his role in establishing the dynasty&#x27;s unique financial system.

==In popular culture==
Ahmad Fanakati was portrayed by Leonard Nimoy in the RAI mini-series &quot;Marco Polo&quot; during the 1980s, and by Mahesh Jadu as a primary antagonist in the second season of the Netflix series &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. He holds an influential role and is further described in the Jami al-Tawarikh.

<doc id="1123526" wikidata="Q15608" url="?curid=1123526" title="2003 Austrian Grand Prix">
<text>The 2003 Austrian Grand Prix(formally known as A1 Grand Prix von Österreich 2003) was a Formula One motor race held on 18 May 2003 at the A1-Ring. It was the sixth round of the 2003 Formula One season and the 27th Austrian Grand Prix. The 69-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari car after starting from pole position. Kimi Räikkönen finished second driving for McLaren with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari. It was the last Austrian Grand Prix to be held until it returned to the renamed Red Bull Ring in 2014.

==Background==
The Grand Prix was contested by ten teams with two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were Ferrari, Williams, McLaren, Renault, Sauber, Jordan, Jaguar, BAR, Minardi and Toyota. It was announced in January 2003 that the Austrian Grand Prix would be dropped from the Formula One calendar in 2004, three years before the contract for the race was due to expire. This was because an exit clause was enabled in response to the European Union pushing forward a ban on tobacco advertising to 1 October 2005.

Before the race, McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 32 points, ahead of Michael Schumacher (28) and Fernando Alonso (25). Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 20 points, while David Coulthard was a close fifth with 19 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren was leading with 51 points, three points ahead of their rival Ferrari. Renault (34 points) and Williams (32 points) contended for fourth place and Jordan was fifth with 11 points.

==Qualifying==
Qualifying was interesting, as there was no knowledge of what the weather would be for the race, making tyre and fuel strategy critical. Michael Schumacher qualified on pole despite a huge slide on his best qualifying lap. Championship leader Kimi Räikkönen qualified second, and was given special dispensation from the FIA to change his cracked valve, without incurring the usual penalty for changing an engine.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
Fernando Alonso chose to start from the pitlane in the spare car, and Mark Webber chose to start from the pitlane in his regular car. This meant Webber could not change tyres or add fuel until the race started, whereas Alonso could. His Jaguar broke this rule, and so Webber received a 10-second stop/go penalty.

Cristiano da Matta had a faulty launch control, which caused 2 aborted starts, reducing the race to 69 laps. On the third (and final) formation lap, Heinz-Harald Frentzen&#x27;s Sauber did not start, and he did not have time to set up the team car.

At the start, Jos Verstappen&#x27;s launch control broke, and he retired. This caused the safety car to be deployed. Michael eventually led Montoya and Räikkönen when the green flag came out at the end of lap 4. The field remained relatively stable for the next several laps.

After 11 laps, it started to rain lightly, although it was not enough to force cars into the pits. Moments later, Jarno Trulli&#x27;s Renault spun at turn one and he rejoined without problems. On lap 23, Michael pitted and there was a problem with his fuel filler, possibly caused by the fact that the team had used it to fill up Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s car, which had a very slow first stop. Some of the fuel that actually did come out of the nozzle hit the bodywork on the sidepods, causing a small fire. The fire was extinguished quickly, and Michael continued in the race, losing about 12 seconds and was now running in third position.

On lap 32, everything turned into Michael&#x27;s favour. Räikkönen was having engine-related performance problems, and this allowed Schumacher to catch and eventually pass him. On the straight between turns two and three, leader Juan Pablo Montoya&#x27;s engine blew up. He made it back to the garage, and Michael was back in the lead. Alonso was on a good run despite starting from the pit lane, and was running in the top five when he spun off course at turn one, on what turned out to be his own oil caused by a blown engine in his Renault. Michael eventually set the fastest lap of the day, at an average speed of 227.894 km/h.

After the second round of stops, Barrichello closed up on second-place Räikkönen, but was unable to pass him due to some good defensive moves by Kimi, despite his car being clearly faster. Michael eventually went on to win the race, his third successive of the season. Jenson Button finished fourth for BAR despite being disappointed in qualifying, and David Coulthard&#x27;s race was uneventful in fifth place. Ralf Schumacher was sixth, Webber finished a brilliant seventh despite his penalties, and Trulli was eighth for the final point. Despite causing the aborted starts earlier in the day, da Matta finished the race, a lap down in tenth position.

<text>The 2003 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 15 June 2003 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.

Michael Schumacher took the win, despite nursing an ailing car home towards the end of the race, with the Williamses of Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya right behind him, and the Renault of Fernando Alonso not far behind them.

This was the fourth time that the Schumacher brothers had finished 1-2, having become the first siblings to do so at the 2001 Canadian Grand Prix.

<text>The 2003 French Grand Prix (formally the LXXXIX Mobil 1 Grand Prix de France) was a Formula One motor race held on 6 July 2003 at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours. It was the tenth race of the 2003 Formula One season. The 70-lap race was won by Ralf Schumacher driving for the Williams team after starting from pole position, which would turn out to be his last race win in Formula One. Juan Pablo Montoya finished second in the other Williams car, with Michael Schumacher third driving for Ferrari. Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s victory was his second consecutive win of the season having won the preceding European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.

As a consequence of the race, Michael Schumacher extended his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship to eight points over Kimi Räikkönen, with Ralf Schumacher a further three points behind. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams reduced the gap to Ferrari from thirteen points to three points.

This was the first French Grand Prix held at the upgraded version of Magny-Cours, having made Château d&#x27;Eau a sharper right hand corner, and a complete modification of the Lycée section, becoming a very sharp right hand turn after the back straight which then leads to a difficult final chicane next to the pit entrance. The pit lane was also significantly shortened as a result of the upgrades.

As of , this is the last 1–2 finish for Williams.

== Classification ==
Jos Verstappen ended up quickest after the first qualifying session due to a drying track. This was the only time a Minardi topped the timesheets at a race weekend. His teammate Justin Wilson&#x27;s time after Q1 was deleted after scrutineering found his car was 2 kg underweight. It was 1:20.968 which at the time was good enough for 2nd place giving Minardi a 1–2.

<text>The 2003 British Grand Prix (formally the LVI Foster&#x27;s British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 20 July 2003 at the Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone, Northamptonshire, England. It was the eleventh round of the 2003 Formula One season. The 60-lap race was won by Rubens Barrichello driving for Ferrari after starting from pole position. Juan Pablo Montoya finished second in a Williams car, and Kimi Räikkönen third driving for McLaren.

Jarno Trulli, driving for Renault, started alongside Barrichello on the front row and led the first eleven laps of the race, until a track invasion by a later-to-be-defrocked priest, who ran along Hangar straight, running opposite to the 170 mph (280 km/h) train of cars, wearing a saffron kilt and waving religious banners. As a result, the vast majority of cars pitted under safety car conditions, which led to the Toyota drivers Cristiano da Matta and Olivier Panis, who had elected not to pit, leading the field until Räikkönen assumed the lead on lap 30 when Da Matta pitted.

== Race report ==
The race began with Ferrari&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello on pole, alongside Renault&#x27;s Jarno Trulli. Kimi Räikkönen of McLaren-Mercedes started from third, while world champion and championship leader Michael Schumacher started from fifth. Barrichello made a poor start, allowing both Trulli and Räikkönen past on an incident-free first lap. Ralf and Michael Schumacher retained their starting positions of fourth and fifth. On the sixth lap, the headrest of David Coulthard dislodged while traversing the first corner (Copse), forcing him to pit for a replacement under safety regulations, and causing a safety car period to allow marshals to clear the track. Upon the resumption of green flag racing, Barrichello closed the gap to Räikkönen before passing him on lap 11. On the following lap, a man invaded the circuit and another safety car period was necessitated. As it was close to the period when the drivers would be making their scheduled pit stops, the vast majority of cars decided to pit under the safety car. The second placed cars from the respective teams were forced to queue up in the pit lane waiting for service, causing them to drop many places. Michael Schumacher, Fernando Alonso and Juan Pablo Montoya were all outside of the top ten. Of the leading contenders, Trulli was in fourth place while both Räikkönen and Ralf Schumacher had jumped Barrichello when in the pits.

The Toyotas of Cristiano da Matta and Olivier Panis – who had opted not to pit – were leading, while Coulthard was in third, having not required a pit stop after his earlier unscheduled headrest replacement. Räikkönen passed Trulli immediately after the restart before clearing team-mate Coulthard on the same lap. Barrichello then passed a slowing Ralf Schumacher on the 17th lap while Räikkönen also passed Panis before chasing down the leading da Matta. Ralf Schumacher was forced to pit after encountering difficulties, while at the same time Michael Schumacher was unable to pass Alonso. By the 26th lap Barrichello was still trying to pass Trulli, and the two leaders continued to extend their lead. Barrichello and Montoya eventually passed Trulli by the end of the 27th lap, before Panis fell victim to both on the 29th. Da Matta eventually ceded the lead after pitting on the 30th lap to Räikkönen. Barrichello then set the fastest lap after being cleared of traffic, taking the lead after Räikkönen pitted for the second time. Barrichello continued to cut the advantage, but Räikkönen regained the lead with a reduced margin following the Brazilian&#x27;s second stop. After closing in, Barrichello passed Räikkönen after pressuring him into a mistake. Michael Schumacher eventually passed Trulli on the 46th lap, but an unforced error by Räikkönen allowed Montoya to seize second position. In the closing phase of the race, Coulthard passed both da Matta and Trulli to earn fifth place.

== Track invasion ==

On the 11th lap, as the procession of cars exited the Becketts corner onto the Hangar straight, Neil Horan cleared the fence wearing a kilt, waving banners with statements &quot;Read the bible&quot; and &quot;The Bible is always right&quot;, and ran towards the sequence of cars, forcing several cars to swerve to avoid him. He eventually returned to the grass runoff area at the side of the track after the cars had passed for the lap, and was tackled by a track marshal. He was later charged with aggravated trespass and pleaded guilty in a Northampton court, stating that he took the open gate as a sign from God, although the prosecution contended that his act was premeditated as he had already prepared the banners prior to attending the Grand Prix. He was later jailed for two months. Although the incident was broadcast to a worldwide audience, it was not shown live in the UK, as the British broadcaster ITV had cut away to a commercial break just as it occurred.

The incident prompted comparisons to the events at the 1977 South African Grand Prix, where volunteer track marshal, Frederick Jansen van Vuuren, ran across the main straight to aid a car and was hit at 170 mph by Tom Pryce, who could not see him until it was too late because of the steep crest on the straight. Both Van Vuuren and Pryce were killed by the impact. A similar incident occurred at the 2000 German Grand Prix (coincidentally won by Barrichello) when a disgruntled ex-Mercedes employee walked along part of the circuit in protest before being arrested. This caused a safety car, which eliminated the lead of Mika Häkkinen, driving for McLaren-Mercedes. Unlike the German protester, Horan ran directly down the middle of the track, and intentionally towards oncoming cars and lurching towards some of them. Stephen Green, the marshal who handled Horan, was later awarded the BARC Browning Medal for &quot;outstanding bravery in tackling a track invader during the 2003 British Grand Prix at Silverstone&quot;, the second recipient after David Purley 30 years previously.

The race led to fears that Formula One bosses Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone, who had been highly critical of the media and corporate facilities of Silverstone, would use the incident to drop the race from the Formula One calendar, with Ecclestone saying: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t necessary – the race was exciting enough without it. But the security wasn&#x27;t good enough.&quot; Drivers and team officials defended the circuit, with Montoya stating: &quot;This was one of the best races of the year, even with the spectator. It was so much fun today.&quot; Sauber boss Peter Sauber stated: &quot;When a man sets himself on fire in the street in Paris, no one blames Paris&quot;. McLaren-Mercedes boss Ron Dennis said: &quot;There is no way you can prevent it happening.&quot;

<text>The 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix (formally the Marlboro Magyar Nagydíj 2003) was a Formula One motor race held on 24 August 2003 at the Hungaroring, Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary. It was the thirteenth round of the 2003 Formula One season. The 70-lap race was won by Renault&#x27;s Fernando Alonso after starting from pole position, scoring his first F1 win and becoming at the time the youngest ever driver to win a Grand Prix, beating the previous record of Bruce McLaren.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This record lasted for over five years until it was beaten by Sebastian Vettel at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. Alonso also became the first Spaniard to win an F1 Grand Prix. It was the first Formula One win for Renault as a constructor since the 1983 Austrian Grand Prix. It was also the first Formula One win for the Enstone-based Formula One team since 1997 German Grand Prix and also the first Formula One win for a French-licensed Formula One team since 1996 Monaco Grand Prix.

It was the first to be held under the newly revamped Hungaroring, with the main straight lengthened and the first hairpin tightened, as well as further alterations near the latter stages of the lap in order to encourage more overtaking.

== Report ==
=== Friday drivers ===
Three teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship had the right to run a third car on Friday&#x27;s additional testing. These drivers were not scheduled to compete in qualifying or the race.

=== Practice ===

During practice Jordan driver Ralph Firman suffered a horrendous crash when his rear wing failed, causing his car to swap ends immediately and collide backwards into the crash barriers with such force that he was knocked unconscious and had to sit out the race. He was replaced by local driver Zsolt Baumgartner making his Formula One debut at his home Grand Prix.

=== Race ===

Alonso, starting from pole on the clean side of the track, made a clean start and lead into the first corner, while the two Williams of Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, who had started second and fourth respectively on the dirty line had difficulty getting away and were down to around tenth place by the first corner, being compounded by Schumacher&#x27;s spin at the second corner.

The McLaren-Mercedes of Kimi Räikkönen managed to climb to third on the opening lap from his grid position of seventh. With Mark Webber struggling in second place, Alonso managed to gain 7s in the first three laps and 21s in the first 13 laps before being forced to pit for fuel. Webber, who had also light-fueled to a high qualifying position, also pitted. Alonso reentered the track in second place, just behind Räikkönen, while Webber dropped much further down the field. At the end of the 16th lap, Räikkönen, Barrichello and Montoya all pitted, allowing Alonso to resume his lead.

On lap 17 Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s BAR came to a halt with a hydraulic failure before Michael Schumacher pitted, and was passed by Montoya while in the pits, who had been able to do a quicker lap while not being held up by Schumacher. On the following lap, David Coulthard, the last of the front-runners, who had been in front of both Schumacher and Montoya, pitted for a very long fuel stop, re-entering behind both. On lap 19, the Ferrari of Rubens Barrichello suffered a left rear suspension failure, causing his Ferrari’s left rear wheel to detach, sending him straight on at the first corner hairpin, into the wall. The race stewards decided against deploying the safety car, preserving Alonso&#x27;s 24s lead over Räikkönen, who rejoined ahead of Webber and proceeded to pull away from the Australian.

Alonso&#x27;s teammate Jarno Trulli led a train of Montoya, Michael and Ralf Schumacher in a train of cars battling for fourth place, when Ralf overtook his brother on the 28th lap. Alonso and Webber were again the first to have a second fuel stop, on lap 30 and 31 respectively but this time Alonso had enough of a lead to re-enter the track ahead of Räikkönen while Webber dropped to ninth after his stop.
Trulli pitted on the next lap, allowing the faster Williams duo of Montoya and Ralf Schumacher into clear air to set fast laps required to jump him, after Räikkönen rejoined after his pit stop behind them, therefore not causing any impedance. Ralf Schumacher immediately pitted on the next lap and rejoined ahead of Trulli but behind Webber who set a fast lap. Montoya set the fastest lap of the race on the next lap, and pitted on the next, exiting in front of Webber as well as Ralf Schumacher and with a clear track in front of him, became the fastest driver on the circuit. On lap 38 Michael Schumacher was in third place, with Coulthard in fourth, followed by Montoya, Webber, Ralf Schumacher and Trulli. Michael Schumacher then pitted, rejoining close behind Trulli, while Webber attempted to hold off Ralf Schumacher.

After a long first stop, third-placed Coulthard was the last to pit on lap 43, again with a long stop, indicating that he has switched to a two-stop strategy and rejoined between Trulli and Michael Schumacher. On lap 46, Ralf Schumacher finally passed Webber for fourth place, but was too far behind third-placed Montoya who had not been held up by Webber. The third round of pit stops saw no change in the order, aside from Coulthard who moved up to fifth behind Ralf Schumacher as a result of not having to pit. Alonso eventually lapped Schumacher, while Montoya spun in the latter stages of the race and had to fend off his teammate in the final laps. Alonso ended with a comfortable 16.8s lead over the second-placed Räikkönen.

In the process, reigning world champion and the championship leader Michael Schumacher was lapped by the Spaniard, and only managed to salvage one point for an eighth-place finish. The second and third-place finishers Räikkönen and Montoya respectively cut his championship lead over his two rivals to just two and one point respectively.

=== Reaction ===
After the race, Alonso described the win as &quot;..a dream come true. I am 22 years old and I have my first victory. I hope I have a long career with lots more victories&quot;. Jean Todt, the Ferrari team&#x27;s manager, referred to their performance as &quot;disappointing&quot;.

=== Post-race ===
Following the Hungarian GP, Ferrari complained about Michelin front tyres used by its competitors, which, according to the complaint, were wider than allowed towards the end of the race and thereafter. Michelin had to narrow its tyres by the next race.

<text>Shift_JIS art is artwork created from characters in the Shift JIS character set, a superset of the ASCII encoding standard intended for Japanese usage. Shift_JIS art has become popular on web-based bulletin boards, notably 2channel, and has even made its way into mainstream media and commercial advertising in Japan.

== In Japanese media ==

The Shift JIS character set is a Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) superset of JIS X 0201 (in turn almost a superset of ASCII) intended for Japanese usage. Unlike Western ASCII art, which is generally designed to be viewed with a monospaced font, Shift_JIS art is designed around the proportional-width MS PGothic font supplied with Microsoft Windows, which is the default font for web sites in Japanese versions of Windows. This dependency has led to the development of the free Mona Font, in which each character is the same width as its counterpart in MS PGothic. This is useful on operating systems lacking the PGothic font, such as Linux.

Within the Japanese community, Shift_JIS art is sometimes abbreviated as &quot;SJIS art&quot;, but is most commonly referred to as &quot;AA&quot; meaning ASCII art, although it rarely restricts itself to the 95 printable characters within the ASCII standard. As with ANSI art, SJIS art is sometimes used for animation. However, due to technical advances, SJIS art also appears in the form of Adobe Flash files and animated GIFs.

The Japanese movie and television show, , frequently included Shift_JIS art, both during screen transitions and within the story itself. One of the recurring characters in the TV series was a Shift_JIS artist who would often draw full-screen Shift_JIS works of art as a way of expressing his support and encouraging the lead character. When they got engaged, posts began flowing in congratulating the new couple, and extravagant Shift JIS art pictures were posted.

The &quot;Touhou Project&quot; meme &quot;Yukkuri shiteitte ne!!!&quot; traces back to Shift JIS art of Reimu Hakurei&#x27;s outfit in Curiosities of Lotus Asia that was posted to 2channel&#x27;s &quot;Touhou Series General Thread&quot; on December 5, 2003. The artwork was later edited and rendered to a head, which someone increased the size of on April 18, 2004, but it wasn&#x27;t really noticed until someone started posting the artwork in the Japanese BBS rental board Shitaraba&#x27;s Immaterial and Missing Power threads on May 28, 2007. Of course, the head was made fun of, but a few weeks later, users started making edits or variations of the text-based head. It&#x27;s known what the Marisa head is based on, but it&#x27;s unclear when the two Shift JIS art was combined or where the &quot;Yukkuri shiteitte ne!!!&quot; phrase was appended to the heads.

<doc id="1123539" wikidata="Q644418" url="?curid=1123539" title="Arnaldo Momigliano">
<text>Arnaldo Dante Momigliano (5 September 1908 – 1 September 1987) was an Italian historian of classical antiquity, known for his work in historiography, and characterised by Donald Kagan as &quot;the world&#x27;s leading student of the writing of history in the ancient world&quot;. He was a MacArthur Fellow in 1987.

==Biography==
Momigliano was born on 5 September 1908 in Caraglio, Piedmont. In 1936, he became Professor of Roman History at the University of Turin, but as a Jew, soon lost his position due to the anti-Jewish Racial Laws enacted by the Fascist regime in 1938, and moved to England, where he remained. After a time at Oxford University, he taught Ancient History at the University of Bristol where he was made a lecturer in 1947. He went to University College London and was elected Chair of Ancient History from 1951 to 1975. He was a Fellow of the Warburg Institute and supervised the PhD of Wolf Liebeschuetz. Momigliano visited regularly at the University of Chicago where he was named Alexander White Professor in the Humanities, and at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. He wrote reviews for &quot;The New York Review of Books.&quot; In addition to studying the ancient Greek historians and their methods, he also took an interest in modern historians, such as Edward Gibbon, and wrote a number of studies of them.

After 1930, Momigliano contributed a number of biographies to the &quot;Enciclopedia Italiana&quot;; in the 1940s and 1950s he contributed biographies to the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. In his retirement, he was made a distinguished visiting professor for life at the University of Chicago and held fellowships at All Souls College, Oxford and Peterhouse, Cambridge. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1969 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. In 1974 he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).

Momigliano died in London on 1 September 1987. A number of his essays were collected into volumes published posthumously. The University of Bristol also established an academic prize in his name, awarded for the best undergraduate performance in Ancient History.

==Views==
In the 1930s, Momigliano joined the National Fascist Party, swore loyalty to Benito Mussolini, and sought exemption from antisemitic Italian racial laws as a party member. Momigliano believed that several classical works of European literature had contributed to the nationalism and warfare in Europe, and considered works such as &quot;Germania&quot; and the &quot;Iliad&quot; as &quot;among the most dangerous books ever written&quot;. Momigliano considered it wasteful and &quot;comical&quot; to spend much efforts at identifying and explaining the forces held responsible for the gradual disintegration of the Roman Empire. In the 1980s, Momigliano and fellow historian Carlo Ginzburg leveled heavy criticism against French philologist Georges Dumézil, whom they charged with being a fascist opposed to &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; society. Momigliano&#x27;s attacks on Dumézil, who was then in very poor health, have been described as &quot;unfair and vicious&quot; by Edgar C. Polomé.

<text>The 2003 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Gran Premio Vodafone d&#x27;Italia 2003) was a Formula One motor race held on 14 September 2003 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Monza, Italy. It was the fourteenth race of the 2003 Formula One season and the eighty-seventh Italian Grand Prix. The 53-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher driving for Ferrari after starting from pole position. Juan Pablo Montoya finished second in a Williams car, with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Ferrari. Marc Gené replaced the injured Ralf Schumacher in the Williams for this race, scoring his highest ever Formula One finish and his last points. Until the 2023 race, this was the shortest-duration fully completed Formula One World Championship race. The race was completed with the fastest ever average race speed of 247.585 km/h.

<doc id="1123543" wikidata="Q7314426" url="?curid=1123543" title="Republic of Austria v. Altmann">
<text>Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677 (2004), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, or FSIA, applies retroactively to acts prior to its enactment in 1976. 

==Decision==
The case turned on the &quot;anti-retroactivity doctrine&quot;, which is a doctrine that holds that courts should not construe a statute to apply retroactively (to apply to situations that arose before it was enacted) unless there is a clear statutory intent that it should do so. This means that, regarding lawsuits filed after its enactment, the FSIA standards of sovereign immunity and its exceptions apply even to conduct that took place before 1976. Since the intent of FSIA was the codification of already existing well settled standards of international law, Austria was deemed not immune from litigation, for acts that first arose from criminal conduct during World War II.

The result of this case for the plaintiff, Maria Altmann, was that she was authorized to proceed with a civil action against Austria in a U.S. federal district court for recovery of five paintings stolen by the Nazis from her relatives and then housed in an Austrian government museum. As the Supreme Court noted in its decision, Altmann had already tried suing the museum before in Austria, but was forced to voluntarily dismiss her case because of Austria&#x27;s rule that court costs are proportional to the amount in controversy (in this case, the enormous monetary value of the paintings). Under Austrian law, the filing fee for such a lawsuit is determined as a percentage of the recoverable amount. At the time, the five paintings were estimated to be worth approximately US$135 million, making the filing fee over US$1.5 million. Although the Austrian courts later reduced this amount to $350,000, this was still too much for Altmann, and she dropped her case in the Austrian court system. 

The high court remanded the case for trial in the Los Angeles district court. Back in the district court, both parties agreed to arbitration in Austria in 2005, which in turn ruled in favor of Altmann on 16 January 2006.

==Case==
Adele Bloch-Bauer, the subject of two of the paintings, had written in her last will: &quot;&quot;Meine 2 Porträts und 4 Landschaften von Gustav Klimt, bitte ich meinen Ehegatten nach seinem Tode der österr. Staats-Galerie in Wien zu hinterlassen&quot;;&quot; that is, &quot;I ask my husband to bequeath my 2 portraits and the 4 landscapes by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian State Gallery in Vienna after his death.&quot; Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer signed a statement acknowledging Adele&#x27;s wish in her last will. He also donated one of the landscape paintings to the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna in 1936. The Austrian arbitration determined that Adele was probably never the legal owner of the paintings. Rather, it viewed it as more likely that Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer was their legal owner and that in turn his heirs, including Altmann, were the rightful owners.

==Aftermath==

=== Reactions and auction ===
The ruling in favor of Maria Altmann came as a great shock to the Austrian public and the government. The loss of the paintings was regarded in Austria as a loss of national treasure. She had attempted earlier to come to some mutual agreement in 1999; however, the government repeatedly ignored her proposals. Maria Altmann told the government that the time was up and there would be no deal from her side anymore. The Austrian government declined to accept a condition of the arbitration which would have allowed it preferentially to purchase the paintings at an attested market price. The paintings left Austria in March 2006 and were returned to Altmann. Consequently, the Austrian government received criticism from the opposition parties for its failure to secure a deal with Altmann at an earlier stage. The city of Vienna also asserted that buying back the paintings was a &quot;moral duty&quot;.

Just months after the Austrian government finally returned Ms. Altmann&#x27;s family&#x27;s heirlooms to her, she consigned the Klimts to the auction house Christie&#x27;s, to be sold on her behalf. &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot; sold for allegedly $135 million in a private sale, the others in auction, e.g. &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II&quot; for $88 million, with the five paintings fetching a total of over $327 million.

=== Gallery of the Klimts ===
=== Documentaries ===
Maria Altmann&#x27;s story has been recounted in three documentary films. &quot;Stealing Klimt&quot;, which was released in 2007, featured interviews with Altmann and others who were closely involved with the story. &quot;Adele&#x27;s Wish&quot; by filmmaker Terrence Turner, who is the husband of Altmann&#x27;s great-niece, was released in 2008, and features interviews with Altmann, her lawyer, E. Randol Schoenberg, and leading experts from around the world. The piece was also featured in the 2006 documentary &quot;The Rape of Europa&quot;, which dealt with the massive theft of art in Europe by the Nazi Government during World War II.

=== Dramatization ===

Altmann is portrayed by Helen Mirren, and Schoenberg by Ryan Reynolds in the film &quot;Woman in Gold&quot;, chronicling Altmann&#x27;s nearly decade-long struggle to recover the Klimt paintings. The film was released on April 3, 2015.

<doc id="1123548" wikidata="Q1572469" url="?curid=1123548" title="USS Becuna">
<text>USS &quot;Becuna&quot; (SS/AGSS-319), a in commission from 1944 to 1969, was a submarine of the United States Navy named for the becuna, a pike-like fish of Europe. During World War II, she conducted five war patrols between August 23, 1944 and July 27, 1945, operating in the Philippine Islands, South China Sea, and Java Sea. She is credited with sinking two Japanese tankers totaling 3,888 gross register tons.

After World War II, &quot;Becuna&quot; operated as part of the United States Pacific Fleet from 1945 to 1949. She served in the United States Atlantic Fleet from 1949 to 1969, primarily as a training ship, although she also made two deployments with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea.

After her decommissioning, &quot;Becuna&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark for her service in World War II. She became a museum ship at the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Becuna&quot; was laid down on April 29, 1943 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on January 30, 1944, sponsored by Mrs. George C. Crawford, and commissioned on May 27, 1944.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====May–August 1944====
After shakedown training from Naval Submarine Base New London, &quot;Becuna&quot; departed Groton on July 1, 1944 and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on July 29. 1944. She then conducted additional training in the Hawaiian Islands.

====First war patrol====
&quot;Becuna&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on August 23, 1944 for her first war patrol. After patrolling for a month without spotting anything but aircraft, she surfaced on the afternoon of September 25, 1944 and her lookouts spied a convoy of three Japanese merchant ships escorted by a destroyer. &quot;Becuna&quot; submerged and fired a spread of six torpedoes. While she evaded a retaliatory depth-charge attack, her crew heard an explosion but could not verify any sinkings; although she claimed to have destroyed two tankers in the convoy, postwar examination of Japanese records failed to verify the kills. She had a similar experience on October 8, 1944 when she launched torpedoes at a heavily escorted tanker north of Palawan Passage in the Philippine Islands. Again her crew heard two distinct explosions but were too busy dodging depth charges to observe the results of the attack. On October 9, 1944, however, she recorded her first verifiable success when she joined the submarine in sinking the 1,943-gross register ton Japanese cargo ship &quot;Tokuwa Maru&quot;. Later in October 1944, she concluded her patrol, putting into Fremantle, Australia, for a refit.

====Second war patrol====
On November 16, 1944, &quot;Becuna&quot; stood out of Fremantle and embarked on her second war patrol. She cruised the waters of the South China Sea off the southern coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina searching for Japanese fleet units. On December 23, 1944 she encountered the Japanese heavy cruiser and light cruiser , which she mistakenly identified as a &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleship and a &quot;&quot;Nachi&quot;-class&quot;(i.e., &quot;Myōkō&quot;-class) heavy cruiser, respectively. Lack of time prevented her from achieving a favorable setup before they entered Cam Ranh Bay on the coast of French Indochina. The remainder of &quot;Becuna&quot;′s patrol proved almost equally unsuccessful. She destroyed floating naval mines and, on her way back to Fremantle, sank two &quot;sea trucks&quot; — the American term for a type of small Japanese cargo ship — with her deck gun just north of Lombok Strait. During January 1945 she underwent a refit at Fremantle.

====Third war patrol====
&quot;Becuna&quot; embarked on her third war patrol in February 1945. She returned to the South China Sea off the coast of French Indochina, where she encountered a Japanese convoy off Cap Padaran on the morning of February 22, 1945. She fired a spread of torpedoes at the tanker &quot;Nichiryu Maru&quot; and sent her to the bottom. She endured a barrage of 70 depth charges from two escort vessels before escaping. She sighted no other Japanese shipping, and her patrol ended with her arrival at Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, where she underwent a refit.

====Fourth war patrol====
&quot;Becuna&quot; departed Subic Bay to begin her fourth war patrol in May 1945. She sighted no Japanese ships, and proceeded to Fremantle, where she arrived in early June 1945 and underwent a refit.

====Fifth war patrol====
On June 21, 1945, Becuna got underway from Fremantle for her fifth war patrol. On two occasions, Imperial Japanese Navy floatplanes on antisubmarine patrol subjected her to bombing attacks. Then, on the night of July 15, 1945, she made radar contact on a single fast-moving target in the Java Sea. After tracking it for several hours, she fired a spread of torpedoes in a night surface attack. They all missed, but the submarine took up the chase and sank the vessel, the Ambon Island-bound Japanese torpedo boat . &quot;Becuna&quot; concluded her patrol at Subic Bay late in July 1945. While she was still undergoing a refit there, World War II ended on August 15, 1945 with the cessation of hostilities with Japan.

===Post-World War II service===
&quot;Becuna&quot; returned to the United States at San Diego, California, on September 22, 1945. She then served in the United States Pacific Fleet until 1949, conducting submarine crew training missions and participating in various multiship exercises. She visited Japan from November 15 to December 9, 1947 and from October 31 to November 6, 1948 and China from November 7 to 29, 1948.

In April 1949, &quot;Becuna&quot; was transferred to the United States Atlantic Fleet as a unit of Submarine Squadron 8. She operated from Groton, Connecticut, conducting refresher training exercises and frequently serving as a school ship for students at the Submarine School. That duty continued until November 1950, when she entered the shipyard of the Electric Boat Company at Groton for nine-month conversion under the Greater Underwater Propulsive Power (GUPPY) Program to a GUPPY IA submarine. She received additional batteries, a submarine snorkel, and a streamlined sail as well as a number of other modifications to various items of equipment.

&quot;Becuna&quot; completed the conversion in August 1951 and then conducted shakedown and refresher training in the West Indies. She returned to Naval Submarine Base New London Groton in September 1951. Over the ensuing 18 years, she operated from Groton, performing a variety of peacetime missions, most of them involving training. She served as a training ship for students at the Submarine School, and prospective submarine commanding officers made their familiarization cruises aboard her. She also provided test services to the Test and Evaluation Force and trained United States Naval Reserve personnel.

&quot;Becuna&quot; made two deployments to serve with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, where she made numerous port visits. She also participated in many exercises with U.S. and foreign naval units. She made one cruise to Scotland, occasionally visited northern European ports, and was a frequent caller at ports in Canada, along the United States East Coast, and in the West Indies. In 1969, she was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and given the hull classification symbol AGSS-319.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Becuna&quot; was decommissioned on November 7, 1969 and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her hull classification symbol reverted to SS-319 in 1971.

&quot;Becuna&quot; remained in reserve at Philadelphia until August 15, 1973, when her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. In 1974, a prospective transfer of &quot;Becuna&quot; to Venezuela fell through. On June 21, 1976, she was donated to the Cruiser Olympia Association for use as a memorial.

==Honors and awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with four battle stars for World War II service
* Navy Occupation Service Medal with &quot;ASIA&quot; clasp
* China Service Medal

==Museum ship==
&quot;Becuna&quot; was placed on permanent display adjacent to the cruiser at Penn&#x27;s Landing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 21, 1976. &quot;Becuna&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Since 1996, both vessels have been operated by the Independence Seaport Museum. &quot;Becuna&quot; received the Historical Welded Structure Award of the American Welding Society in 2001.

 | vertex_config =

In geometry, the gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid is a polyhedron constructed by attaching a pentagonal antiprism to the base of a pentagonal pyramid. An alternative name is diminished icosahedron because it can be constructed by removing a pentagonal pyramid from a regular icosahedron.

== Construction ==
The gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid can be constructed from a pentagonal antiprism by attaching a pentagonal pyramid onto its pentagonal face. This pyramid covers the pentagonal faces, so the resulting polyhedron has 15 equilateral triangles and 1 regular pentagon as its faces. Another way to construct it is started from the regular icosahedron by cutting off one of two pentagonal pyramids, a process known as diminishment; for this reason, it is also called the &quot;diminished icosahedron&quot;. Because the resulting polyhedron has the property of convexity and its faces are regular polygons, the gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid is a Johnson solid, enumerated as the 11th Johnson solid formula_1.

== Properties ==
The surface area of a gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid formula_2 can be obtained by summing the area of 15 equilateral triangles and 1 regular pentagon. Its volume formula_3 can be ascertained either by slicing it off into both a pentagonal antiprism and a pentagonal pyramid, after which adding them up; or by subtracting the volume of a regular icosahedron to a pentagonal pyramid. With edge length formula_4, they are:
formula_5

It has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the pentagonal pyramid: the cyclic group formula_6 of order 10. Its dihedral angle can be obtained by involving the angle of a pentagonal antiprism and pentagonal pyramid: its dihedral angle between triangle-to-pentagon is the pentagonal antiprism&#x27;s angle between that 100.8°, and its dihedral angle between triangle-to-triangle is the pentagonal pyramid&#x27;s angle 138.2°.

<text>The AN-52 was a French pre-strategic nuclear weapon carried by fighter bomber aircraft.

The weapon was first tested on 28 August 1972, and entered service in October of that year. 84 bombs were manufactured for use by 24 Dassault Mirage III,36 SEPECAT Jaguar,and 24 Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard.

== Description ==
The AN-52 was 4.2 m (13 ft 9 in) long and weighed 455 kg (1,003 lb). It shared the MR 50 CTC (&quot;charge tactique commune&quot; - common tactical warhead) warhead of the Pluton missile, with two yield options: a low-yield version with an explosive yield of 6 to 8 kilotons and a higher-yield version with a 25 kt yield.

== Operational use ==
It was carried by Dassault Mirage IIIE, SEPECAT Jaguar A, and Dassault Super Étendard aircraft. It was also temporarily carried by the first 30 Dassault Mirage 2000N-K1 nuclear-strike fighters, pending introduction of the standard Mirage 2000N-K2 version, which was armed with the ASMP nuclear cruise missile.

It was retired in 1992 in favour of the ASMP missile.

== Preserved examples ==
A practice example of the AN 52 is preserved on its trolley in the main hangar at the , Rochefort, France. Note the AN 52 is not identified as such and has neither labeling or signage.

<text>Victoria Station was a chain of railroad-themed steakhouse restaurants. At the peak of its popularity in the 1970s, the chain had 100 locations in the United States. The firm filed for bankruptcy in 1986. The last remaining restaurant in the former chain was located in Salem, Massachusetts until it abruptly closed in December 2017.

A four-restaurant chain in Malaysia continues under the Victoria Station Restaurant name with a train theme but a significantly different menu; however, it claims an independent heritage, whereby the founding family thought up the concept on a London Underground train while on holiday in England.
==History==
The concept evolved from a Cornell University School of Hotel Administration graduate project, according to original owners Bob Freeman, Peter Lee, and Dick Bradley, all 1963 graduates of the school. The first location was opened in San Francisco in December 1969 and was a 158-seat restaurant located on the Embarcadero at Broadway that was constructed out of five boxcars and two cabooses around a central lobby-service area. Another source incorrectly claimed an April 1969 opening date. The restaurant was grossing $90,000 monthly during its first year of operations.

By the end of 1978, Victoria Station had 97 restaurants, all company owned.

The chain was designed to attract members of the baby boom generation. The theme of the restaurant was loosely based on London&#x27;s Victoria Station. Antique English railway artifacts were used as decor inside, and the exteriors were composed of American Railway cars, primarily boxcars, with a signature Caboose placed in front. On the &quot;entry platform&quot; to each restaurant was a London-style phone booth. Prime rib was the featured item on a limited menu that included steaks, barbecued beef ribs, and shrimp done in a variation of scampi style known as &quot;Shrimp Victoria&quot;. Most of the restaurants used authentic railway cars for dining areas, often boxcars or cabooses.

The Victoria Station chain flourished in the 1970s, according to a memoir by former Victoria Station corporate marketing manager Tom Blake. The company was among the first restaurant companies to offer its employees stock options and an ESOP program. The peak of success of the Victoria Station restaurant chain took place at the time of the culmination of a joint venture with Universal Studios, which resulted in the opening of Victoria Station Universal City, a location on the &quot;hill&quot; near where &quot;Citywalk&quot; now stands. At its peak, the Universal City location of Victoria Station was among the highest grossing restaurants in the United States. The coaches in the restaurant used four of the coaches from Flying Scotsman&#x27;s tour of America. They were repainted and converted into dining cars.

The U.S. operations of the Victoria Station chain began running into financial difficulties in the mid-1980s, causing gradual shutdowns of the franchise restaurants. In May 1986, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. bankruptcy court. Eight months later, it was reported in January 1987 that the company had a restructuring plan in place that would require it to sell a number of restaurants.

A new company, called Victoria Station Acquisition Corporation and was controlled by Lowell Farkas, purchased the Victoria Station trademark and 11 of the restaurants for $6.5 million and the assumption of a $1 million tax liability.

There was a similar chain called &quot;Twickenham Station&quot; in Alabama and Florida during the same time span. They were not connected. (Huntsville AL, Montgomery AL, Mobile AL, Pensacola FL)

==Promotions==

Singer Johnny Cash produced a promotional album of train songs for the chain, titled &quot;Destination Victoria Station&quot;, which was then sold in the restaurants. This included the title song of the same name written and performed by Cash specifically for the album.

The chain was a sponsor of the United States Ski Team at least from 1977 to 1979 For several years, the Park City Ski Area (Mountain Resort) -- at which the US Olympic Ski team practices -- named one of its ski lifts Victoria Station.

Alfred Hitchcock flipped the railroad switch for the official opening of Victoria Station Universal City, on May 2, 1977. That restaurant included a funicular which carried patrons 600 feet up from the lower parking lot.

 | properties = convex,&lt;br&gt;non-composite
 | net = Johnson solid 63 net.png

In geometry, the tridiminished icosahedron is a Johnson solid that is constructed by removing three pentagonal pyramids from a regular icosahedron.

== Construction ==
The tridiminished icosahedron can be constructed by removing three regular pentagonal pyramid from a regular icosahedron. The aftereffect of such construction leaves five equilateral triangles and three regular pentagons. Since all of its faces are regular polygons and the resulting polyhedron remains convex, the tridiminished icosahedron is a Johnson solid, and it is enumerated as the sixty-third Johnson solid formula_2. This construction is similar to other Johnson solids as in gyroelongated pentagonal pyramid and metabidiminished icosahedron.

The tridiminished icosahedron is non-composite polyhedron, meaning it is convex polyhedron that cannot be separated by a plane into two or more regular polyhedrons.

== Properties ==
The surface area of a tridiminished icosahedron formula_3 is the sum of all polygonal faces&#x27; area: five equilateral triangles and three regular pentagons. Its volume formula_4 can be ascertained by subtracting the volume of a regular icosahedron with the volume of three pentagonal pyramids. Given that formula_5 is the edge length of a tridiminished icosahedron, they are:
formula_6

<text>In geometry, the metabidiminished icosahedron is one of the Johnson solids (). The name refers to one way of constructing it, by removing two pentagonal pyramids () from a regular icosahedron, replacing two sets of five triangular faces of the icosahedron with two adjacent pentagonal faces. If two pentagonal pyramids are removed to form nonadjacent pentagonal faces, the result is instead the pentagonal antiprism.

<text>Stand in the Fire is a live album by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, released December 26, 1980. It was recorded in August 1980 during a five-night residency at The Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California and featured two new original songs (&quot;Stand in the Fire&quot; and &quot;The Sin&quot;) and one new cover (&quot;Bo Diddley&#x27;s a Gunslinger&quot;). The album was dedicated to Martin Scorsese. 

It was released in a limited edition, LP replica sleeve on CD April 25, 2006 in Japan. A remastered and expanded edition (four additional tracks) was released on March 26, 2007 in the U.K., March 27, 2007 in the U.S. A deluxe vinyl edition, expanded to a 2-LP set, that includes 10 bonus tracks: 4 songs previously unavailable on vinyl and 6 songs previously unreleased on any format (that is, 20 tracks in total) was released via Rhino Records on 2 April 2021.

Band members Zeke Zirngiebel, Bob Harris and Marty Stinger were in Boulder, a band signed to Elektra Records. The singer was Stan Bush. Their self-titled album was released in 1979 and it included Zevon&#x27;s &quot;Join Me in L.A.&quot; Bob Harris later went on to work with Frank Zappa.

Zevon called the concerts &quot;The Dog Ate the Part We Didn&#x27;t Like Tour&quot;.

<doc id="1123569" wikidata="Q391419" url="?curid=1123569" title="Dorotheus of Gaza">
<text>Dorotheus of Gaza ( &quot;Dorotheos tes Gazes&quot;; 505 – 565 or 620,) or Abba Dorotheus, was a Christian monk and abbot.

==Life==
He joined the monastery Abba Serid near Gaza through the influence of elders Barsanuphius and John. Around 540 he founded his own monastery nearby and became abbot there. It was to the monks of this monastery that he addressed his instructions/teaching (, &quot;ascetics&quot;) of which a considerable number have survived and have been compiled into &quot;Directions on Spiritual Training&quot;, originally composed in Greek and translated in medieval Syriac, Arabic, Georgian, and Church Slavonic. It is typical that at the heading of his teachings he announces that he offers his teaching &quot;following the death of Abba John the Prophet and the complete silence of Abba Barsanuphius&quot;. It seems that as long his holy spiritual fathers lived he thought that he should live in obedience, keep silent and not give his own teaching. Only after the demise of one and the decision of the other not to speak did he decide to record his ascetic experiences, in order to edify the monks at the new monastery. He presents his teaching looking to one sole aim, the edification of those to whom it is addressed. He is not interested in elegance of expression or style. Thus, his words are uncontrived, clear and simple. A careful study of the teachings of Abba Dorotheus shows a strict logical structure in an intelligible and analytic manner. The matters are not approached in a theoretical way, but on the basis of everyday reality and on his monastic experience. He primarily links his teaching with the Holy Scripture and often introduces the subjects by starting from a biblical quote or passage, mainly from the Old Testament. Furthermore, he uses biblical citations from both the Old and New Testament throughout the development of his thought. In his practical teaching, Abba Dorotheus does not ignore the theology of the Church. In his thought, theology and the practical-ascetic life coexist. He certainly is not interested in giving some doctrinal teaching. Nevertheless, his practical teaching is saturated by the faith of the Church. 

==Legacy==
Abba Dorotheus (St. Dorotheus the Hermit of Kemet) is recognized as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church and Oriental Orthodox Church with his Feast Day on June 5 in the Roman Catholic Church, June 18 (June 5 old style) in Churches of Eastern Orthodox tradition and August 13 in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Some instructions of Abba Dorotheus==
* God&#x27;s providence.

Do not wish for everything to be done according to your determination, but wish that it is how it should be, and in this way, you will attain peace with everyone. And believe that everything that happens to us, even the most insignificant, occurs through God&#x27;s Providence. Then you will be able to endure everything that comes upon you without any agitation.

* Yearning toward goodness.

11. Everyone that desires salvation must not only avoid evil, but is obliged to do good, just as it says in the Psalm: &quot;Depart from evil and do good&quot; (Psalm 34:14). For example, if somebody was angry, he must not only not get angry, but also become meek; if somebody was proud, he must not only refrain from being proud but also become humble. Thus, every passion has an opposing virtue: pride — humility, stinginess — charity, lust — chastity, faintheartedness — patience, anger — meekness, hatred — love.

* Struggles with deficiencies.

21. Who resembles a person who satisfies his passions? He is like a person who, after being struck down with his enemy&#x27;s arrows, then takes them with his hands and pierces his own heart with them. He who opposes passions is like a person that is showered with his enemy&#x27;s arrows, but remains untouched because he is dressed in steel. One who has eradicated his passions, is like a person that although under a torrent of arrows, either shatters them or returns them into the hearts of his enemies — just as the Psalm states: &quot;Their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken&quot; (Psalm 37:15).

* Guarding the conscience.

23. When God created man, He planted something divine into him — a certain conception — a spark that has both light and warmth. The conception that enlightens the mind and indicates what is right and what is wrong is called conscience. Conscience is a natural law. Living in times before any written law, patriarchs and saints pleased God by following the voice of their conscience.

* Temperance, meekness.

24. Not only should we observe moderation with food, but we must also abstain from every other sin so that just as we fast with our stomach, we should fast with our tongue. Likewise, we should fast with our eyes i.e. not look at agitating things, not allow your eyes freedom to roam, not to look shamelessly and without fear. Similarly, arms and legs should be restrained from doing any evil acts.

27. It is impossible for anyone to get angry with his neighbor without initially raising himself above him, belittling him and then regarding himself higher than the neighbor.

* Sorrows and God&#x27;s Providence.

24. When we suffer something unpleasant from our best friend, we know that he did not do it intentionally and that he loves us. We must think likewise of God, Who created us, for our sake incarnated, and died for our sake having endured enormous suffering. We must remind ourselves that He does everything from His goodness and from His love for us. We may think that while our friend loves us, in not having sufficient good sense in order to do everything correctly, he therefore involuntarily hurt us. This cannot be said of God because He is the highest wisdom. He knows what is good for us and accordingly, directs everything for our benefit, even in the smallest things. It can also be said that although our friend loves us and is sufficiently sensible, he is powerless to help us. But this certainly cannot be said of God, because to Him everything is possible and nothing is difficult for Him. Consequently, we know that God loves us and shows clemency toward us, that He is eternally wise and omnipotent. Everything that He does, He does for our benefit, and we should accept it with gratitude as from a Benefactor, even though it may appear to be grievous.

* Attaining spiritual peace.

29. Let us examine as to why a person sometimes gets annoyed when he hears an insult, and other times he endures it without getting agitated. What is the reason for this contrast? And is there one reason or are there several? There are several reasons, although they are all born from a main one. Sometimes it happens that after praying or completing a benevolent exercise, the person finds himself in a kind spiritual disposition and therefore, is amenable to his brother and doesn&#x27;t get annoyed over his words. It also happens that a person is partial to another, and as a consequence, endures without any annoyance, everything that the individual inflicts upon him. It also happens that a person may despise the individual who wants to insult him, and therefore ignores him.

* Humility, vile thoughts. Humility.

31. Know that if a person is oppressed by some thought and he does not confess it (to his spiritual father), he will give the thought more power to oppose and torment him. If the person confesses the oppressive thought, if he opposes and struggles with it, instilling into himself the desire for the opposite to the thought, then the passion will weaken and will eventually cease to plague him. Thus with time, in committing himself and receiving assistance from God, that person will conquer the passion itself.

* Love towards your neighbor.

44. I heard of one person that when he came to one of his friends and found the room in disarray and even dirty, he would say to himself: &quot;Blessed is this person, because having deferred his concerns for earthly cares, he has concentrated his mind that much toward Heaven, that he doesn’t even have time to tidy up his room.&quot; But when he came to another friend&#x27;s place and found his room tidy and neat, he would say to himself; &quot;The soul of this person is as clean as his room, and the condition of the room speaks of his soul.&quot; And he never judged another that he was negligent or proud, but through his kind disposition, saw good in everyone and received benefits from everyone. May the good Lord grant us the same kind disposition, so that we too may receive benefits from everyone and so that we never notice the failings of others.

Dositheus was a disciple of Dorotheus and himself considered a Saint. The story is that as a young man Dositheus, an army page, lead a wild and dissolute life. He became curious, however, after hearing numerous stories about the city of Jerusalem and made a journey there about 520-525AD. 
It was at Golgotha that an unknown woman who turned out to be Virgin Mary struck up a conversation with him about eternal torments in hell, which led to his converting from paganism to Christianity. He became a monk at Gaza under the supervision of Dorotheus, who had a long and steady struggle to teach Dositheus discipline. Dorotheus was criticized by many of the monastery for his lax disciple.

Dositheus was noted, however, for his humility, self-denial and gentle and supportive ways with the sick. and he worked in the infirmary. It was probably here that he contracted tuberculosis or a similar condition.

He died about 530AD, five years after becoming a monk As he lay dying Dositheus begged Dorotheus to &quot;pray for an early release from his sufferings&quot;. Dorotheus answered, &quot;Have a little patience. God&#x27;s mercy is near.&quot; Soon after he said to him, &quot;Depart in peace and appear in joy before the blessed Trinity, and pray for us&quot;.&quot;
After his death, Dorotheus declared that &quot;Dositheus had surpassed the rest (of his disciples) in virtue without the practice of any extraordinary austerity.&quot; 
Dositheus was Canonized, he is the patron saint of respiratory diseases and his Feast day is February 23.

<text>The descriptive term long-period variable star refers to various groups of cool luminous pulsating variable stars. It is frequently abbreviated to LPV.

==Types of variation==
The General Catalogue of Variable Stars does not define a long-period variable star type, although it does describe Mira variables as long-period variables. The term was first used in the 19th century, before more precise classifications of variable stars, to refer to a group that were known to vary on timescales typically hundreds of days. By the middle of the 20th century, long period variables were known to be cool giant stars. The relationship of Mira variables, semiregular variables, and other pulsating stars was being investigated and the term &quot;long period variable&quot; was generally restricted to the coolest pulsating stars, almost all Mira variables. Semiregular variables were considered intermediate between LPVs and Cepheids.

After the publication of the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, both Mira variables and semiregular variables, particularly those of type SRa, were often considered as long period variables. At its broadest, LPVs include Mira, semiregular, slow irregular variables, and OGLE small amplitude red giants (OSARGs), including both giant and supergiant stars. The OSARGs are generally not treated as LPVs, and many authors continue to use the term more restrictively to refer just to Mira and semiregular variables, or solely to Miras. The AAVSO LPV Section covers &quot;Miras, Semiregulars, RV Tau and all your favorite red giants&quot;.

The AAVSO LPV Section covers the Mira, SR, and L stars, but also RV Tauri variables, another type of large cool slowly varying star. This includes SRc and Lc stars which are respectively semi-regular and irregular cool supergiants. Recent researches have increasingly focused on the long period variables as only AGB and possibly red giant tip stars. The recently classified OSARGs are by far the most numerous of these stars, comprising a high proportion of red giants.

==Properties==

Long period variables are pulsating cool giant, or supergiant, variable stars with periods from around a hundred days, or just a few days for OSARGs, to more than a thousand days. In some cases, the variations are too poorly defined to identify a period, although it is an open question whether they are truly non-periodic.

LPVs have spectral class F and redwards, but most are spectral class M, S or C. Many of the reddest stars in the sky, such as Y CVn, V Aql, and VX Sgr are LPVs.

Most LPVs, including all Mira variables, are thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars with luminosities several thousand times the sun. Some semiregular and irregular variables are less luminous giant stars, while others are more luminous supergiants including some of the largest known stars such as VY CMa.

==Long secondary periods==
Between a quarter and a half of long period variables show very slow variations with an amplitude up to one magnitude at visual wavelengths, and a period around ten times the primary pulsation period. These are called long secondary periods. The causes of the long secondary periods are unknown. Binary interactions, dust formation, rotation, or non-radial oscillations have all been proposed as causes, but all have problems explaining the observations.

==Pulsation modes==
Mira variables are mostly fundamental mode pulsators, while the semiregular and irregular variables on the asymptotic giant branch pulsate in the first, second, or third overtone. Many of the less regular LPVs pulsate in more than one mode.

Long secondary periods cannot be caused by fundamental mode radial pulsations or their harmonics, but strange mode pulsations are one possible explanation.

<doc id="1123571" wikidata="Q795287" url="?curid=1123571" title="B43 nuclear bomb">
<text>The B43 was a United States air-dropped variable yield thermonuclear weapon used by a wide variety of fighter bomber and bomber aircraft.

The B43 was developed from 1956 by Los Alamos National Laboratory, entering production in 1959. It entered service in April 1961. Total production was 2,000 weapons, ending in 1965. Some variants were parachute-retarded and featured a ribbon parachute.

The B43 was built in two variants, Mod 1 and Mod 2, each with five yield options. Depending on version, the B43 was in diameter, and length was between and . The various versions weighed between . It could be delivered at altitudes as low as , with fuzing options for airburst, ground burst, free fall, contact, or laydown delivery. Explosive yield varied from 70 kilotons of TNT to 1 megaton of TNT.

The B43 used the Tsetse primary design for its fission stage, as did several mid- and late-1950s designs.

The B43 was one of four thermonuclear gravity bombs carried by Canadian CF-104 jets while serving in Germany between June 1964 and 1972.

==Delivery systems==

Carrier aircraft included most USAF, USN and USMC fighters, bombers and attack aircraft, including the A-3 Skywarrior, A-4 Skyhawk, A-5 Vigilante, A-6 Intruder, A-7 Corsair II, B-47 Stratojet, B-52 Stratofortress, B-58A Hustler, F-100 Super Sabre, F-105 Thunderchief, F-4 Phantom II, F-104 Starfighter, FB-111A strategic bomber variant, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F/A-18 Hornet. The B-1B Lancer was also intended to carry the B43, though it remains unclear whether this particular aircraft was ever type-approved to carry the B43 prior to the B-1&#x27;s reassignment to conventional strike roles. The B43 was also supplied for delivery by Royal Air Force Canberra and Valiant aircraft assigned to NATO under the command of SACEUR.

==Broken Arrow==

The B43 was never used in combat, but it was involved in a nuclear accident when an A-4E Skyhawk, BuNo &quot;151022&quot;, of the (from Attack Squadron VA-56), was lost off the coast of Japan on 5 December 1965 when it rolled off an elevator, in of water in the Pacific Ocean, from Kikai Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. The Skyhawk was being rolled out of the number 2 hangar bay, onto the number 2 elevator, when it continued over the edge and was lost. Neither the pilot LTJG D. M. Webster, airframe, nor the bomb were ever recovered. No public mention was made of the incident at the time and it would not come to light until a 1989 US DoD report revealed that one of these one-megaton bombs (which had recently been retired from service and replaced) had gone missing. Japan then asked for details of the incident.

==Withdrawn==

The B43 was phased out in the 1980s, and the last B43 weapons were retired in 1991 in favor of the newer B61 and B83 weapons.

<text>The 2003 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the 2003 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 October 2003 at the Suzuka Circuit. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 2003 Formula One World Championship, as well as the 29th Japanese Grand Prix. The 53-lap race was won by Rubens Barrichello driving for Ferrari after starting from pole position. Kimi Räikkönen, who started the race from eighth position, finished second in a McLaren car, with David Coulthard third in the other McLaren.

Barrichello&#x27;s win saw Ferrari clinch their 13th Constructors Championship title, the team&#x27;s fifth title in a row, with Barrichello&#x27;s team-mate Michael Schumacher finishing eighth to secure his record-breaking 6th World Driver&#x27;s Championship surpassing the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio in 1957. This was also Schumacher&#x27;s fourth consecutive World Driver&#x27;s title, matching the record set by Fangio in 1957.

This event also notably marked the last race for cars using launch control and fully-automatic gearboxes, since their reintroduction at the 2001 Spanish Grand Prix. The FIA banned these two electronic driver aid systems ahead of the season. This was also the final Grand Prix for 3-time race winner Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jos Verstappen, father of future world champion Max Verstappen.

==Report==

===Background===
Heading into the final race of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was leading the World Driver&#x27;s Championship standings with 92 points; McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen was second on 83 points, 9 points behind Schumacher. A maximum of 10 points were available, which meant that Räikkönen could still win the title. Schumacher only needed an eighth-place finish to become Driver&#x27;s Champion even if Räikkönen won the race. Räikkönen needed to win and Schumacher not to score a single point in order for him to become Driver&#x27;s Champion.

There was one driver change heading into the race. Having been a driver for the BAR-Honda team for most of the season, Jacques Villeneuve pulled out of the Grand Prix after asking to be released by the team and was replaced by the team&#x27;s test driver Takuma Sato. 

Sato had been confirmed as a driver for the team for the 2004 season in the days running up to the race and would drive alongside Jenson Button.

=== Friday drivers ===
Three teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship had the right to run a third car on Friday&#x27;s additional testing. These drivers did not compete in qualifying or the race.

<text>Gary Maurice Davies (born 13 December 1954) is a British broadcaster. From 1982 to 1993 he was a BBC Radio 1 disc jockey and a regular presenter of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

As of 2025, Davies can be heard on BBC Radio 2 presenting Saturday night show &quot;Sounds of the 80s,&quot; as well as regularly standing in for other presenters.

==Early career==
After working in marketing for a mail order company, working for a Rawtenstall company which manufactured candlewick bathroom and bedroom soft furnishings and managing a Manchester disco, in the late 1970s Davies was a DJ in Placemate 7 Manchester. He regularly hosted artists in Placemate 4 music rooms and began his broadcasting career at Manchester&#x27;s Piccadilly Radio in 1979, before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1982 to present a Saturday late night show, making his debut on 4 December 1982 (the same date as Janice Long). Within weeks he was on the roster to present &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC television alongside his Radio 1 colleagues.

==BBC Radio 1==

===&quot;The Bit in the Middle&quot;===
In 1984, Davies took over the lunchtime show. He called it &quot;The Bit in the Middle&quot; which consisted of features, such as &#x27;The Day-To-Day Challenge&#x27;, in which the same person would go on air each weekday to answer quiz questions and try to upgrade their prize, and &quot;Willy on the Plonker&quot;, which involved crazed piano-playing of a well-known hit for listeners to identify.

On Sunday 6 September 1987 he presented the Sunday afternoon stereo countdown of the Top 40 from 5pm to 7pm, filling in for Bruno Brookes.

Davies was promoted with the catchphrase &quot;Young, Free and Single&quot; and a jingle &quot;Wooh! Gary Davies&quot;.

Davies&#x27; show rarely changed until it was rebranded in 1991 as &quot;Let&#x27;s Do Lunch&quot;, with new features, including &quot;Spin &amp; Win&quot; (a variation on &quot;Willy on the Plonker&quot;, with a cryptic clue replacing the frenetic piano work) and the &quot;Classic Track&quot; featuring a piece of classical music. Previous feature &quot;The Sloppy Bit&quot; (a dedication followed by love song) was unchanged but renamed &quot;Lots of Love&quot;. He also introduced &quot;The Non Stop Half Hour&quot; from after the 2.30pm news until 3pm, which was half an hour of non-stop music.

Davies&#x27; Tuesday show would include the revelation of the new Top 40 singles chart. However, updated technology meant that the chart could be complied much more quickly and saw the chart reveal move forward to Sundays from 4 October 1987 so Davies instead did countdowns of the US chart and the UK album chart – although the US chart he featured was not the official &quot;Billboard&quot; one, but an airplay-only chart compiled by &quot;Radio and Records&quot; magazine.

===Weekends===
In 1992, Davies moved from the lunchtime show to the weekend breakfast, keeping a selection of the features. He also started a Sunday late night slot. The &quot;Lots of Love&quot; feature moved to this show, with dedications being read out over the music to &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;. During this period, he also provided holiday cover for weekday presenters, usually Steve Wright or Nicky Campbell.

===Leaving BBC Radio 1===
Davies was dismissed from Radio 1 on 11 November 1993. His last record was &quot;Layla&quot; by Derek and the Dominoes — which had also been his first record on the station 11 years earlier.

Davies was the last Radio 1 DJ to host &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; before the show&#x27;s &quot;year zero&quot; revamp in October 1991.

==Virgin Radio==
In January 1994, Davies moved to Virgin Radio, presenting their Sunday morning &quot;Classic Tracks&quot; slot from 10am to 2pm. The show later went out from 9am to 1pm and he remained there until early 1995.

After a brief sabbatical, Davies rejoined Virgin Radio in December 1995, taking over the Sunday late night show from 10pm to 2am. This gave him the chance to revive his Sunday night format. In 1997, Davies moved to an earlier slot on Sundays from 6-10pm, before moving on to present the weekday late night slot in January 1999, where he remained until December 2000.

==Century Radio==
Davies was heard on the Real Radio and the Century Network, presenting a CD chart show every Sunday originally from 1 to 4pm but from 2006 the show went out from 4pm to 7pm. However, this finished in mid-2008. Currently he owns a publishing company called Good Groove, where he also manages new artists. Good Groove&#x27;s first publishing hit was &quot;Black Coffee&quot; by All Saints and Davies later went on to sign singer Corinne Bailey Rae.

==BBC Radio 2==
On 20 March 2017, during Sara Cox&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the 80s&quot; 24-hour Danceathon for Red Nose Day 2017, Davies was interviewed by Simon Mayo on &quot;Simon Mayo Drivetime&quot;. and later on 9 June 2017, Davies stood in for Sara Cox to present a special 2¾ hour edition of &quot;Sounds of the 80s&quot; on BBC Radio 2. This was his first time back on BBC Radio after 23 years away. In October 2017, January &amp; October 2018, and October/November 2020, Davies sat in for Steve Wright&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show.

On 18 May 2018, as part of a re-organisation of the Radio 2 DJ roster, following changes to the station&#x27;s evening line-up, Davies took over from Sara Cox as the new host of Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the 80s&quot;. He also provides holiday cover for fellow Radio 2 presenters including Zoe Ball, Sara Cox, OJ Borg, Dermot O&#x27;Leary, Vernon Kay, and Rylan Clark.

On 24 February 2023, it was announced that Davies would be the temporary presenter of BBC Radio 2&#x27;s mid-morning show from 6 March, following Ken Bruce&#x27;s departure from the station, until the new permanent presenter Vernon Kay took over in May.

On 17 February 2024, Davies became the temporary host of BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; following the death of Steve Wright. Davies hosted the programme until 29 June, with Mark Goodier taking over on 6 July.

On 8 January 2025, whilst sitting in for Vernon Kay on Radio 2 and in conversation with a &quot;Ten to the Top&quot; contestant, Davies revealed that he was of Syrian extraction.

<text>, , or is a village in Kautokeino Municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. 

The village is located along the river Kautokeinoelva, a tributary of the Alta river. about south of the town of Alta and about 60 kilometres north of the village of Kautokeino. The village is made up predominantly of Sami people, a non-Norwegian group indigenous to the Fennoscandinavian peninsula .

Masi Church has stood in the town since the 17th century. The present church building is a reconstruction built after the original was torched by German soldiers during the Nazi occupation of Norway in World War II.

During the late 1970s, the Norwegian government planned to construct the Alta Hydroelectric Power Station downstream, which was expected to flood Masi, upstream Kautokeino, and the surrounding reindeer pasture and disrupt reindeer migration and wild salmon fishing. Masi was among several sites of protest in what became known later as the Alta controversy.

<doc id="1123587" wikidata="Q492004" url="?curid=1123587" title="Habeas Corpus Act 1679">
<text>The Habeas Corpus Act 1679 is an Act of Parliament in England (31 Cha. 2. c. 2) during the reign of King Charles II. It was passed by what became known as the Habeas Corpus Parliament to define and strengthen the ancient prerogative writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, which required a court to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner&#x27;s detention and thus prevent unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment.

==Earlier and subsequent history==

The Act is often wrongly described as the origin of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. But the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; had existed in various forms in England for at least five centuries before and is thought to have originated in the Assize of Clarendon of 1166. It was guaranteed, but not created, by Magna Carta in 1215, whose article 39 reads (translated from Latin): &quot;No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or exiled or in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor will we send upon him except upon the lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land.&quot; The Act of 1679 followed an earlier Habeas Corpus Act 1640, which established that the command of the King or the Privy Council was no answer to a petition of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Further Habeas Corpus Acts were passed by the British Parliament in 1803, 1804, 1816, and 1862, but it is the Act of 1679 which is remembered as one of the most important statutes in English constitutional history. Though amended, it remains on the statute book to this day.

==Content==
In criminal matters other than treason and felonies (a distinction which no longer exists), the act gave prisoners or third parties acting on their behalf the right to challenge their detention by demanding from the Lord Chancellor, Justices of the King&#x27;s Bench, and the Barons of the Exchequer of the jurisdiction a judicial review of their imprisonment. The act laid out certain temporal and geographical conditions under which prisoners had to be brought before the courts. Jailors were forbidden to move prisoners from one prison to another or out of the country to evade the writ. In case of disobedience jailers would be punished with severe fines which had to be paid to the prisoner.

==Parliamentary history==
The Act came about because the Earl of Shaftesbury encouraged his friends in the Commons to introduce the Bill where it passed and was then sent up to the House of Lords. Shaftesbury was the leading Exclusionist—those who wanted to exclude Charles II&#x27;s brother James, Duke of York from the succession—and the Bill was a part of that struggle as they believed James would rule arbitrarily. The Lords decided to add many amendments to the Bill in an attempt to limit it, designed to protect the Lords from arrest by members of the Commons. However, the Commons had no choice but to pass the Bill with the Lords&#x27; amendments because they learned that the King would soon end the current parliamentary session and they desired to see the Act enacted, even with limitations.

A popular but likely untrue anecdote holds claims that the Act only passed because the votes in favour were miscounted as a joke. When a parliamentary house votes on legislation, each side—those voting for and against—appoints a teller who stands on each side of a door through which those Lords who vote &quot;aye&quot; re-enter the House (the &quot;nays&quot; remain seated). One teller counts aloud whilst the other teller listens and keeps watch to verify the count. Of the Habeas Corpus Act count, Gilbert Burnet wrote,Lord Grey and Lord Norris were named to be the tellers: Lord Norris, being a man subject to vapours, was not at all times attentive to what he was doing: so, a very fat lord coming in, Lord Grey counted him as ten, as a jest at first: but seeing Lord Norris had not observed it, he went on with this misreckoning of ten: so it was reported that they that were for the Bill were in the majority, though indeed it went for the other side: and by this means the Bill passed.In the words of historian Helen Nutting, this miscount story is &quot;highly improbable&quot;. Proponents of the story cite as supporting evidence a discrepancy between the vote total and the attendance count in the parliamentary minutes: the clerk recorded in the minutes of the Lords that the &quot;ayes&quot; had fifty-seven and the &quot;nays&quot; had fifty-five, a total of 112, but the same minutes also state that only 107 Lords had attended that sitting. However, the attendance counts in the minute book were frequently inaccurate, and the attendance count is off by five rather than nine, undermining rather than supporting Burnet&#x27;s reminiscence. According to Nutting, had the vote been miscounted, King James II would almost certainly have &quot;taken advantage of a real miscount to overturn the act&quot;, since he opposed it.

King Charles II assented to the Act in 1679 since, Nutting explains, &quot;it was no longer controversial&quot;. The Act is now stored in the Parliamentary Archives.

== Application in New Zealand ==
The &quot;Habeas Corpus Act 1679&quot; and the later acts of 1803, 1804, 1816 and 1862 were reprinted in New Zealand as Imperial Acts in force in New Zealand in 1881. The 1679 act, along with the 1640 and 1816 acts, was retained in New Zealand law by the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988. They were later repealed and replaced by the Habeas Corpus Act 2001.

<doc id="1123598" wikidata="Q421955" url="?curid=1123598" title="Suberin">
<text>Suberin is a lipophilic, complex polyester biopolymer of plants, composed of long-chain fatty acids called suberin acids and glycerol. Suberin, interconnected with cutins and lignins, also complex macromolecules, form a protective barrier in the epidermal and peridermal cell walls of higher plants. Suberins and lignins are considered covalently linked to lipids and carbohydrates, respectively, and lignin is covalently linked to suberin, and to a lesser extent, to cutin. Suberin is a major constituent of cork, and is named after the cork oak, &quot;Quercus suber&quot;. Its main function is as a barrier to movement of water and solutes.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Suberin is highly hydrophobic and a somewhat &#x27;rubbery&#x27; material. In roots, suberin is deposited in the radial and transverse/tangential cell walls of the endodermal cells. This structure, known as the Casparian strip or Casparian band, functions to prevent water and nutrients taken up by the root from entering the stele through the apoplast. Instead, water must bypass the endodermis via the symplast. This allows the plant to select the solutes that pass further into the plant. It thus forms an important barrier to harmful solutes. For example, mangroves use suberin to minimize salt intake from their littoral habitat.

Suberin is found in the phellem layer of the periderm (or cork). This is outermost layer of the bark. The cells in this layer are dead and abundant in suberin, preventing water loss from the tissues below. Suberin can also be found in various other plant structures. For example, they are present in the lenticels on the stems of many plants and the net structure in the rind of a netted melon is composed of suberised cells.

==Structure and biosynthesis==
Suberin consists of two domains, a polyaromatic and a polyaliphatic domain. The polyaromatics are predominantly located within the primary cell wall, and the polyaliphatics are located between the primary cell wall and the cell membrane. The two domains are supposed to be cross-linked. The exact qualitative and quantitative composition of suberin monomers varies in different species. Some common aliphatic monomers include α-hydroxyacids (mainly 18-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid) and α,ω-diacids (mainly octadec-9-ene-1,18-dioic acid). The monomers of the polyaromatics are hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, such as feruloyltyramine.

In addition to the aromatics and aliphatics components, glycerol has been reported a major suberin component in some species. The role of glycerol is proposed to interlink aliphatic monomers, and possibly also to link polyaliphatics to polyaromatics, during suberin polymer assembly. The polymerization step of aromatic monomers has been shown to involve a peroxidase reaction.

The biosynthesis of the aliphatic monomers shares the same upstream reactions with cutin biosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of aromatics shares the same upstream reactions with lignin biosynthesis.

Phlobaphen also occurs in the polyaromatic part of the suberin mixture.

<doc id="1123606" wikidata="Q7270980" url="?curid=1123606" title="Queensland Police Service">
<text>The Queensland Police Service (QPS) is the principal law enforcement agency responsible for policing the Australian state of Queensland. In 1990, the Queensland Police Force was officially renamed the Queensland Police Service and the old motto of &quot;Firmness with Courtesy&quot; was changed to &quot;With Honour We Serve&quot;. The headquarters of the Queensland Police Service is located at 200 Roma Street, Brisbane.

The current Commissioner is Stephan (Steve) Gollschewski. The Commissioner reports to the Minister for Police, presently Daniel Purdie.

== History ==
Queensland came into existence as a colony of the British Empire on 1 December 1859. The region was previously under the jurisdiction of the New South Wales governance with towns policed by small forces controlled by the local magistracy. &quot;The Police Act of 1838&quot; (2 Vic. no. 2) which officially codified a variety of common behaviours as criminal and regulated the police response to them, continued as the template for policing. On 13 January 1860, Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset was appointed the Inspector-General of the Queensland Police. Queensland was divided into 17 districts, each with its own police force headed by a Chief Constable under authority of a local magistrate. The position of Inspector-General was abolished soon after it was established, in July 1860, and most of the operations of the police until 1863 reverted to the control of local police magistrates and justices.

The Queensland Police underwent a major reform in 1864 and the newly re-organised force commenced operations with approximately 143 employees under the command the first Commissioner of Police, David Thompson Seymour. The service had four divisions: Metropolitan Police, Rural Police, Water Police, and Native Police. At the turn of the century there were 845 men and 135 Aboriginal trackers at 256 stations in Queensland.

=== 1900s ===
In 1904 the Queensland Police started to use fingerprinting in investigations. In the 1912 Brisbane general strike the Queensland Police were used to suppress striking workers. The first female police officers, Ellen O&#x27;Donnell and Zara Dare, were inducted in March 1931 to assist in inquiries involving female suspects and prisoners. Following World War II a number of technological innovations were adopted including radio for communication within Queensland and between state departments. By 1950 the Service had a staff of 2,030 police officers, 10 women police and 30 trackers. In February 1951, a central communication room was established at the Criminal Investigation Branch in Brisbane.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
On 14 May 1963, the Juvenile Aid Bureau was established. In 1965 female officers were given the same powers as male officers. The Queensland Police Academy at Oxley, Brisbane, was completed in 1972. Bicycles were phased out in 1975 and more cars and motorcycles were put into service. The Air Wing also became operational in 1975 following the purchase of two single-engine aircraft.

=== 1980s ===
The decade was a turbulent period in Queensland&#x27;s political history. Allegations of high-level corruption in both the Queensland Police and State Government led to a judicial inquiry presided over by Tony Fitzgerald. The Fitzgerald Inquiry which ran from July 1987 to July 1989 led to charges being laid against many long-serving police, including Jack Herbert, Licensing Branch Sergeant Harry Burgess, Assistant Commissioner Graeme Parker and Commissioner Terry Lewis. Lewis was jailed and served ten and a half years.

The Fitzgerald Inquiry also led to a perjury trial against former Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, which ended with a hung jury. The Director of Public Prosecutions elected not to pursue a retrial due to Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s age and health. It was later revealed that the jury foreman for the trial was a member of the Young Nationals and identified with the &#x27;friends of Joh&#x27; movement.

The Criminal Justice Commission was established in 1989 by the &quot;Queensland Criminal Justice Act 1989&quot;, following widespread corruption amongst high-level Queensland politicians and police officers being uncovered in the Fitzgerald Inquiry. It has since merged in 2002 with the Queensland Crime Commission to form the Crime and Misconduct Commission. The Criminal Justice Commission was responsible for significant research into the Queensland Police Service.

A new computerised message switching system was put into use throughout Queensland in 1980. At the time it was one of the most effective police communication systems in Australia.

=== 1990s ===
The &quot;Police Powers and Procedures Act 1997&quot; was passed by the Queensland Government on 1 July 1997 and took effect 6 April 1998. Law enforcement equipment introduced in the 1990s include oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray, the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver firearm and later the Glock semi-automatic pistol, the long 26&quot; baton to the 21&quot; extendable baton, and linked to hinged handcuffs in 1998, and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) laser-based detection devices and an Integrated Traffic Camera System in 1999 to enforce traffic speed limits.

=== 2000s ===
The &quot;Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000&quot; came into force in July 2000 which consolidated the majority of police powers into one Act. The Queensland Police contributed to the national CrimTrac system and the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS), established in 2000. The &quot;Crime and Misconduct Act 2001&quot; commenced 1 January 2002 and redefined the responsibilities of the Service and the Crime and Misconduct Commission (CMC) with respect to the management of complaints. The CMC also has a witness protection function. The CMC has investigative powers, not ordinarily available to the Queensland Police, for the purposes of enabling the commission to effectively investigate particular cases of major crime. The CMC also has the power to investigate cases of misconduct in the Queensland public sector, particularly the more serious cases of misconduct. In 2013, the CMC became the Crime and Corruption Commission.

In 2002 there were 8,367 police officers (20.2% female) and 2,925 staff members at 321 stations, 40 Police Beat shopfronts and 21 Neighbourhood Police Beats throughout the state. By 2004 the Service had grown to 9,003 police officers (21.8% female) and 2,994 other staff members. As at 30 June 2016 there were 11,971 police officers (26.3% female) and 2,794 other staff members.

The Taser conducted electrical weapon (CEW) was trialled by some officers in 2006 and was eventually issued in 2009. In mid-2007, approximately 5,000 officers participated in the Pride in Policing march through Brisbane.

===2010s===
In 2013 following a change in government, another government department named the Public Safety Business Agency was created. This was following a recommendation of the Keelty review into police and community safety operations. Human resources, information technology and other divisions were transferred from the Service and other departments to the new agency. In mid-2016, some services were moved back to the Service. Eight geographic regions (Far Northern, Northern, Central, North Coast, Metropolitan North, Metropolitan South, Southern, and South Eastern) was reduced to five (Northern, Central, Southern, Brisbane, South Eastern). Some statewide functions and administrative divisions were also adjusted.

Following the G20 political forum, the Service created its third unit citation. The other two Queensland Honours citations were the &#x27;flood and cyclone&#x27; (2011) and the &#x27;QP150&#x27; (2014) for the Service&#x27;s sesquicentennial year.

The Queensland Police marked 150 years of service to the State of Queensland on 1 January 2014.

In 2015 the Commissioner approved officers and staff members to march in the Brisbane Pride Festival as part of showing organisational diversity, and accessibility of policing services to the LGBTI communities.

===2020s===
In February 2020, an organisational restructure was announced; but a month later, staffing then being diverted to support the health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including border closures, and maintaining quarantine hotels. Early in 2021, due to two separate incidents, a new &#x27;Youth Crime Taskforce&#x27; was formed under an assistant commissioner, and another section was elevated to command level to become the Domestic, Family Violence and Vulnerable Persons Command.

A commission of inquiry was created in May 2022 to examine policing responses to domestic and family violence prevention, with an August appearance of Commissioner Carroll. The commission was told of a lack of staffing of the Domestic, Family Violence and Vulnerable Persons Command compared to other areas, of discrimination within the organisation, and of senior officers&#x27; racist and misogynistic behaviour. A deputy commissioner resigned the next day.

In October 2022, following a review by State Disaster Coordinator Steve Gollschewski, it was announced the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) would be dissolved in June 2024, resulting in the largest reform of emergency services in Queensland since 1990. The Queensland Fire and Rescue Service along with the Rural Fire Service would form the Queensland Fire Department, with a new central headquarters. On Monday 3 June 2024 the State Emergency Service (SES) was moved to the Queensland Police Service; along with the Volunteer Marine Rescue and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Queensland, becoming the new Marine Rescue Queensland (MRQ) and therefore made part of the Queensland emergency services.

== Criticisms ==
The Queensland Police Special Bureau was formed on 30 July 1940 and renamed Special Branch on 7 April 1948. It was criticised for being used for political purposes by the Bjelke-Petersen government in the 1970s and 1980s, such as enforcing laws against protests (sometimes outnumbering the protesters or using provocateurs to incite violence so the protesters could be arrested) and investigating and harassing political opponents. It was disbanded in 1989 following a recommendation by the Fitzgerald Inquiry into police corruption. Special Branch records were shredded.

In 1991, an arrest was recorded by journalist Chris Reason on live TV. In the video, a plain clothes officer and other officers are seen restraining a man and putting him in the back of a car. The man was reportedly an international criminal from Europe but it was later found to be some one else. This was an embarrassment for the QPS and it came to be known as &#x27;Democracy Manifest&#x27;.

In 1994 six police officers, becoming known as the &#x27;Pinkenba Six&#x27;, took three Aboriginal boys from Fortitude Valley and left them at Pinkenba as an unofficial way to punish the boys for suspected offences. The police officers were charged with abduction but were subsequently acquitted in court; the police service put them on twelve months probation for their errors of judgement.

The Service has been accused of institutional racism after its fierce support of Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley who stood trial for the 2004 assault and manslaughter of Mulrunji Doomadgee. Senior Sergeant Hurley was initially subject of a Coronial Inquest by Coroner Christine Clements where he was found to have a case to answer despite conflicting medical evidence. The Director of Public Prosecutions Leanne Clare refused to place Senior Sergeant Hurley on trial for lack of evidence. After reviewing the evidence the Crime and Misconduct Commission (CMC) also found that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute for wrongdoing. The Queensland Attorney General Kerry Shine ordered a review despite advice from the State Solicitor-General Walter Sofronoff QC highlighting the lack of evidence. A review by New South Wales Former Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street found there was a case to answer. Senior Sergeant Hurley was found not guilty by a jury in the Townsville Supreme Court and the findings of the Coronial Inquest were subsequently overturned by the Queensland District Court. The District Court ruled that Coroner&#x27;s finding &#x27;...was against the weight of the evidence&#x27;.

Also in 2006 and 2008 footage was caught of police beating homeless men after they were pinned to the ground. It came a year after a report by organisations including the Queensland Council of Social Service (QCOSS) and community groups such as the Red Cross, which detailed widespread harassment by police of the socially vulnerable. Approximately 75% of interviewees made such claims, but the report was ignored by the government. Police Minister Judy Spence said of the report
&#x27;At a cursory glance, it looks like a compendium of views from nameless, homeless people&#x27;.

In 2008, the CMC investigated an officer after he used a Taser on a restrained teenage girl at South Bank, but recommended the officer only receive &#x27;managerial guidance&#x27;. The incident was also against police policy to use tasers on minors. Police later charged the girl with breaching a move on order, but the case was thrown out with the magistrate criticising police&#x27;s over-reaction. A subsequent inquiry by the CMC into the use of the TASER by the Queensland Police Service found there was no systemic abuse of the device by officers, despite the chairman saying the incident &#x27;showed a concerning pattern within QPS towards the handling of policing incidents&#x27;. CCTV video footage was released, delayed by possible civil action, showing the girl lashing out and kicking the officer, knocking the Taser out of his holster before he used it as she was held on the ground by two security guards.

In June 2009 a man died after allegedly being tasered by Queensland police 28 times. The policeman in question claimed the deceased was tasered a much lower number of times, suggesting the device was making erroneous readings. The coronial inquest later found this not to be the case, and that the officer tasered the man 28 times for up to five seconds at a time.

In early 2010 searches were made by the CMC (Crime and Misconduct Commission) on police stations in Queensland. The results of the searches and interrogations of police officers are being kept confidential, but come less than a year after a CMC report claiming:

:the evidence revealed an attitude on the part of a not insignificant number of police officers, and their supervisors, that it was acceptable to act in ways that ignored legislative and QPS policy requirements, that were improper, and in some cases were dishonest and unlawful. Based on past experiences, the CMC had no confidence that the attitudes of those police officers would change without the pressure of public exposure.

The CMC report focused on police corruption, and not police brutality that accounted for ten times as many complaints in Surfers Paradise – 130 reports to 13 in the 18 months to March 2010.

In 2016 several human rights organisations signed an open letter calling for a public investigation the Queensland Police Service, and for preventative measures to be implemented against police abuse.

Queensland police were criticised for using excessive force against protesters in 2021.

Arising from an earlier Women&#x27;s Safety and Justice Taskforce, in May 2022 a commission of inquiry was announced to examine policing responses to domestic and family violence prevention, with possible systemic cultural issues within the organisation, and whether there was the capability, capacity, and structure to respond to the violence. Giving evidence in August 2022, Police Commissioner Carroll accepted &#x27;there was a problem within QPS with misogynistic and disrespectful views towards women affecting how police officers responded to domestic and family violence&#x27;. In October 2022, there were calls for reforms and deeper investigations into Queensland police by figures such as Opposition MP David Crisafulli and human rights activist Gracelyn Smallwood.

== Regions ==

Between 1991 and 2013 there were eight geographic regions (Far Northern, Northern, Central, North Coast, Metropolitan North, Metropolitan South, Southern, and South Eastern), three commands (State Crime Operations, Operations Support, and Ethical Standards), and four divisions (Human Resources, Finance, Administration, and Information Management).

As of 2017, there are seven police regions and eight commands in the State of Queensland, each under command of an assistant commissioner. By 2020, there were four administrative areas, each overseen by a deputy commissioner organizing the respective regions and commands as such: Regional Operations (Northern, Central, Brisbane, Southern, and South Eastern), Specialist Operations (Community Contact Command, Intelligence, Counter-Terrorism and Major Events Command, Operations Support Command, State Crime Command, Road Policing Command, and Commonwealth Games Group), and Strategy, Policy and Performance (Crime and Corruption Commission Police Group, Ethical Standards Command, Legal Division, Organisational Capability Command, and People Capability Command). The regions were further divided into districts and further still into divisions. A new government department, the Public Safety Business Agency, existed from 2013 to 2021 which took over the portfolios of human resources, finance, administration, education and training, and information technology).

By 2023, with the announced incorporation of the Disaster &amp; Emergency Management into the QPS from the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, the QPS Organisation Structure took on the following form:

* Regional Operations
** Far Northern Region
** Northern Region
** Central Region

== Ranks and structure ==

The Queensland Police Service has two classes of uniformed personnel: police officers (&#x27;sworn&#x27; and &#x27;unsworn&#x27;), and staff members (public servants, including police liaison officers, watchhouse officers, protective services officers and pipes and drums musicians). Both classes wear the same blue uniform with shoulder patches. 

As of 2015 all police officer rank insignia changed to an &#x27;ink blue&#x27; background with insignia embroidered in white. There has been the addition of a &#x27;recognition of service&#x27; horizontal bar between rank insignia and the words &#x27;Queensland Police&#x27; for officers who have been on rank for a particular length of time. This &#x27;recognition of service&#x27; is only for the ranks from senior constable to senior sergeant.

In 2023 the rank of chief inspector was reintroduced into the Service. 

Rank insignia is worn only by uniformed officers. Prior to mid-2009, only officers at the rank of inspector and above (commissioned officers) had the words &#x27;Queensland Police&#x27; embroidered on their epaulettes, however new uniform mandates saw the introduction of the words &#x27;Queensland Police&#x27; on all epaulettes issued to police officers after this date. The epaulettes of commissioned officers are significantly larger than the epaulettes of lesser ranks. Different salary bands apply within the same rank commensurate with years of service. Officers relieving at a higher rank temporarily wear the epaulettes of the higher rank.

Police recruits wear a light blue epaulette with embroidered &#x27;POLICE RECRUIT&#x27;. 

Police recruits undertaking the PACE program wear a dark blue epaulette with no embroided text. 

Police officers and other members may be eligible to wear Queensland and Australian honours.

=== Constable ranks ===
* Constable (plain blue)
** Special Constable (plain blue with text &quot;Special Constable&quot;)
* Senior Constable (two embroidered chevrons)
** Leading Senior Constable (title; two embroidered chevrons with two bars underneath)

=== Sergeant ranks ===
* Sergeant (three embroidered chevrons)
* Senior Sergeant (embroidered crown with laurels)

=== Commissioned ranks ===
* Inspector (three pips)
** Chief Inspector (one crown) (re-introduced as a title in 2023)
* Superintendent (one crown and one pip)
* Chief Superintendent (one crown and two pips)
* Assistant Commissioner (crossed tipstaves with laurels)
* Deputy Commissioner (one pip and crossed tipstaves with laurels)
* Commissioner (one crown and crossed tipstaves with laurels)

=== Staff member epaulettes ===

Several staff member roles wear a uniform similar to police officers. 

In 2016 the State Government Protective Security Service (SGPSS), then under the Department of Public Works, was transferred to the Queensland Police Service and renamed the Protective Services Group. Protective services officers are sworn or affirmed staff members, and wear an ink-navy shirt with a maroon-coloured police shoulder patch with &#x27;Protective Services&#x27; above it, and maroon epaulettes.

Staff member uniform includes: 

* assistant watchhouse officers (grey epaulettes stating &#x27;watchhouse officer&#x27;) 
* pipes and drums musicians (hard board epaulettes and with pipes and drums wording)
* police liaison officer (PLO) (yellow epaulettes with embroidered &#x27;POLICE LIAISON OFFICER&#x27; or &#x27;SENIOR POLICE LIAISON OFFICER&#x27;; a &#x27;Police Liaison Officer&#x27; hat badge, with a yellow-chequered hat band)
* protective services officer (maroon epaulettes with embroidered &#x27;PROTECTIVE SERVICES&#x27; and &#x27;PROTECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER&#x27; OR &#x27;SENIOR PROTECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER&#x27;. Additionally, horizontal white bars indicate the officer&#x27;s public service pay grade.)
* Torres Strait Island police liaison officer (green/white/blue epaulettes with embroidered &#x27;TORRES STRAIT ISLAND POLICE LIAISON OFFICER&#x27; and rank) 

Chaplains, whilst not employed by the Service, wear a uniform with purple epaulettes with embroidered &#x27;POLICE CHAPLAIN&#x27;.

== Leadership ==
=== Commissioners ===
The following list chronologically records those who have held the post of Commissioner of the Queensland Police Service.

=== Chief officers ===
== Equipment ==
Standard equipment issued and worn on duty belt or load-bearing vest by a uniformed police officer:
* Glock 22 pistol .40-calibre, with three magazines (45 rounds of ammunition) 
* Extendable baton () concealed within pouch
* Lithgow Arms SAF-LOK Mark 5 hinged handcuffs
* Motorola APX 8000 radio and radio pouch
* OC (oleoresin capsicum) spray within pouch
* Axon TASERs (X26, TASER 10)
* Axon Body 2, Flex 2, Body 3 body worn cameras (BWC)
* Apple iPads and iPhones to access the operational computer QPRIME, given the name &#x27;QLiTE&#x27;.
* Load bearing vest

Officers, if necessary, can access the Remington Patrolman R4 carbine service rifle if qualified.

Supplier of belt and pouches is TripleB Leathercraft and Tote Systems.

Other equipment provided to officers include:
* Maglite
* Lightweight medic gloves and voice recording devices

An equipment vest was created called the general accoutrement vest (GAV) which proved extremely unpopular and rarely used by officers, and in the 2010s was replaced by the load bearing vest (LBV) which is worn by most operational officers. The LBV was designed to transfer the weight from the hips to the torso, and held the radio, handcuffs and OC spray. In early 2023, an integrated load-bearing vest (ILBV) was being rolled out to replace the LBV, and included an overt ballistic vest into one vest, designed to increase officer safety, as well as visibility.

Body-worn video technology was introduced following a trial in 2015. The TASER 10 was introduced in 2024. 

== Fleet ==

In the 1980s to 2010s, the Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon and Toyota Aurion made up most of the fleet of both general duties and highway patrol operations. In more recent years the ceasing of Australian-produced models has meant overseas alternatives. The Hyundai Sonata have been used as general duties vehicles, while the Subaru Levorg and Kia Stinger have been employed for use as highway patrol vehicles. Hyundai iLoads and modified Toyota Hiluxes are used as prisoner transport vehicles, or commonly referred to as &quot;paddy wagons&quot;. The Toyota Camry Hybrid and Kia Sorento Hybrid has become the primary general duties vehicles in metropolitan areas, replacing the remaining Holden Commodores, as well as older Hyundai Sonatas. Queensland Police aims to have a 100% hybrid sedans and SUV fleet by 2025.

In 2023, US-built pickup trucks have been spotted in service, with vehicles such as the Chevrolet Silverado being utilised by the Mounted Unit.

The SERT (Special Emergency Response Team) unit also has two specialised armoured vehicles, Lenco BearCats, at its disposal for use in riot control and other potentially dangerous situations throughout the Brisbane/South Eastern and northern police regions, with one vehicle stationed in Brisbane and Cairns each. Additionally, the EORT (Explosive Ordnance Response Team) in 2017 purchased a Lenco BombCat, a bigger and stronger vehicle based on a BearCat.

From 1996 to 2015, nominated vehicles were fitted with other 200 in-car computers supplied by the state transport department, the Mobile Integrated Network Data Access (MINDA) units. From April 2012, automatic number plate recognition technology was fitted to road policing unit vehicles, follow earlier trials.

Queensland Police has received its first police helicopter, based on the Gold Coast in 2012. The helicopter was used for a six-month trial period. The highly anticipated $1.6 million Bell 206 Long Ranger has already been hailed a success, assisting police in 24 different dispatches in its first three days of operation, and will be used extensively during major events such as Schoolies Week and the Gold Coast 600. The helicopter is fitted out with state-of-the-art equipment such as infrared and thermal imaging cameras, and other equipment based on the NSW Police Force helicopters. A second helicopter a BO 105 was introduced by July 2014 in time for the G20 summit in November, responsible for patrolling Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. The helicopters have Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and Searchlight (TRAKKA beam) capabilities.
In January of 2024 the Queensland Government announced the arrival of a third helicopter allocated to the Far North, to be based in Townsville, alongside a $13 million (AUD) role-out of digitally encrypted radios in the region. This new air capability consisted of a leased Airbus EC135T2 while a permanent system was procured.

In a first for an Australian police department, Queensland Police have purchased numerous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as &#x27;drones&#x27;) which have already been used for surveillance purposes in numerous situations where sending in officers is deemed too risky such as during sieges or hostage rescue operations. They can also be used to aerially examine crime scenes.

Queensland Water Police operate three purpose-designed patrol vessels and numerous smaller rigid-hulled inflatable boats.

<text>The Casparian strip is a band-like thickening in the center of the root endodermis (radial and tangential walls of endodermal cells) of vascular plants (Pteridophytes and Spermatophytes). The composition of the region is mainly suberin, lignin and some structural proteins, which are capable of reducing the diffusive apoplastic flow of water and solutes into the stele and its width varies between species. The Casparian strip is impervious to water so can control the transportation of water and inorganic salts between the cortex and the vascular bundle, preventing water and inorganic salts from being transported to the stele through the apoplast, so that it must enter the cell membrane and move to the stele through the symplastic pathway, blocking the internal and external objects of the cell. The function of mass transportation are similar to that of animal tissues.. The development of the Casparian strip is regulated by transcription factors such as SHORT-ROOT (SHR), SCARECROW (SCR) and MYB36, as well as polypeptide hormone synthesised by midcolumn cells. 


The chemistry of the Casparian strip has been described as composed of suberin. According to some studies, the Casparian strip begins as a localized deposition of phenolic and unsaturated fatty substances in the middle lamella between the radial walls, as partly oxidized films. The primary wall becomes encrusted with and later thickened by deposits of similar substances on the inside of that wall. The encrustation of the cell wall by the material constituting the Casparian strip presumably plugs the pores that would have otherwise allowed the movement of water and nutrients via capillary action along that path. The cytoplasm of the endodermal cell is firmly attached to the Casparian strip so that it does not readily separate from the strip when the cells are subjected to contraction of the protoplasts. At the root, the Casparian strip is embedded within the cell wall of endodermal cells in the non-growing region of the root behind the root tip. Here, the Casparian strip serves as a boundary layer separating the apoplast of the cortex from the apoplast of the vascular tissue thereby blocking diffusion of material between the two. This separation forces water and solutes to pass through the plasma membrane via a symplastic route in order to cross the endodermis layer.

Casparian strips differentiate after an outward growth of the cortex is completed. At this level of the root development, the primary xylem of its vascular cylinder is only partly advanced. In gymnosperms and angiosperms displaying secondary growth, the roots commonly develop only endodermis with Casparian strips. In many of those, the endodermis is later discarded, together with the cortex, when the periderm develops from the pericycle. If the pericycle is superficial and the cortex is retained, either the endodermis is stretched or crushed or it keeps pace with the expansion of the vascular cylinder by radial divisions, and the new walls develop Casparian strips in continuity with the old ones.

In the absence of secondary growth (most monocotyledons and a few eudicots), the endodermis commonly undergoes wall modifications. There are two developmental stages beyond the development of the Casparian strip. In the second stage suberin (or endoderm) coats the entire wall on the inside of the cell. As a result, the Casparian strip is separated from the cytoplasm and the connection between the two ceases to be evident. In the third stage, a thick cellulose layer is deposited over the suberin, sometimes mainly on the inner tangential walls. The thickened wall, as well as the original wall in which the Casparian strip is located, may become lignified, creating a secondary cell wall. The Casparian strip may be identifiable after the thickening of the endodermal wall has occurred. The thickened endodermal wall may have pits. The successive development of endodermal walls is clearly expressed in monocotyledons.

==Discovery==
The discovery of the Casparian strip dates back to the mid-19th century, and advances in the understanding of the endodermis of plant roots. In 1865, the German botanist Robert Caspary first described the endodermis of the root of plants, found that its cell wall was thickened, and named it Schuchtzscheide. Later scholars called the thickened part of it the Carls Belt, which was named after Casbury. The term &quot;Caspary&#x27;schen fleck&quot; () appeared in the 1870s literature, and after the 20th century, it was often called the Casparian strip. In 1922, researchers first left the Casparian strip from the root of plants to study its composition. 

==Composition==
The chemical composition of the Casparian strip has been controversial for a long time. Casbury pointed out that this structure may be composed of lignin or suberin. Later scholars mostly thought it was suberin. It was not until the 1990s that after analyzing the Casparian strip of several plants, it was found that lignin was the main component, but many textbooks have not been updated. Although the cell wall of the endothelium is rich in woodbolic, this is the result of the sublevel differentiation of the endothelium. In the past, some scholars believe that the formation of the endodermis of Casparian strip is the beginning of sublevel differentiation, but there is no direct relationship between the two. The casparian strip has formed after the primary differentiation, and the secondary differentiation begins with the slash cut of the root, not where the Casparian strip is.

==Function==
The casparian strip is fully filled with the gap between endothelial cells, including the middle lamella, making the cell walls of the two cells almost fused. In the transportation of water and inorganic nutrients at the root of plants, the Casparian strip mainly affects the transportation of primary in vitro, that is, the transportation of water and inorganic salts through the interstitial cells of the epidermis and cortex cells. When water and inorganic salt come to the endothelial cells, they need to enter the cell through the cell membrane because the casparian strip is not water-permeable, and then transported by the protoplasmic inner path to reach the lignan cells of the stele, and then to other organs such as the stems and leaves. When the growth environment is unfavourable, the casparian strip can act as a barrier between plant cells and the outside world, avoiding the entry of ions or outflow of their own ions in the environment. In addition, the thickening of the carcass belt and the cortex also prevents toxic substances or pathogen invasion, as well as the function of preventing water dispersion. Some studies have shown that plants may form thicker Casparian strip in high-salt environments, and in areas closer to the tip of the roots, which may be an adaptation to the environment, but compared with the endothelial sublevel differentiated wooden bolt walls, which are significantly thickened in high-salt adversity, the Casparian strip changes is smaller.

The Casparian strip is mainly located in the endodermis of the root, but some plants also have the Casparian strip in the outer cortex on the outer side of the root cortex, stem or leaf. For example, the conifers of &quot;Pinus bungeana&quot; and the stems of &quot;Pelargonium&quot; have the Casparian strip, which may be related to preventing water dispersion or pathogenic invasion.

==Development==

The development of the Casparian strip is started after the endogenic cells are fully delayed, and there is currently two news signal transduction that promote endothelial cell formation of Casparian strip. The first is transcription factor Short-root (SHR) Activated additional two transcription factors Myb36 and Scarecrow (SCR), the former can stimulate Casparian Strip Proteins (Casp1-5), Peroxidase (PER64) and ESB1 (Enhanced) Suberin 1), etc., the latter affects the position of the Casparian strip in the inner skin cell, which causes the position of the Casparian strip to be too close to the Stele; the second is medium Casparian Strip Integrity Factor (CIF1-2) and the GSO1 (SGN3) and GSO2 receptor bonded to the endothelial cell radial wall and the GSO2 receptor in the lateral wall. CASP in the cells is concentrated to a cell membrane region corresponding to the position of the Casparian strip, forming a Casparian Strip Membrane Domain (CSD), and the CSD is incorporated in the region. The GS01 receptor is surrounded by the edge of each CSD region, promoting CSD fused into a continuous strip region, that is, the region where the Casparian strip is to be formed.

Casparian strip protein is a membrane protein that interacts with each other and can bind to proteins needed to synthesize lignin such as PER64, ESB1 and respiratory oxidase homologer F (RBOHF) to activate the downstream reaction of Casparian strip development. In mutant plants lacking GSO1 receptors or at the same time lacking CIF1 and CIF2 polypeptides, CASP1 is abnormally distributed on the endothelial cell membrane, and the CSD cannot normally fuse into a continuous and complete band structure, thus eventually forming a broken and discontinuous Casparian strip.

Environmental factors such as light, soil salinity and water deficit can affect the development of the Casparian strip.

<text>Herbig–Haro(HH)objects are bright patches of nebulosity associated with newborn stars. They are formed when narrow jets of partially ionised gas ejected by stars collide with nearby clouds of gas and dust at several hundred kilometers per second. Herbig–Haro objects are commonly found in star-forming regions, and several are often seen around a single star, aligned with its rotational axis. Most of them lie within about one parsec (3.26 light-years) of the source, although some have been observed several parsecs away. HH objects are transient phenomena that last around a few tens of thousands of years. They can change visibly over timescales of a few years as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds of interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM). Hubble Space Telescope observations have revealed the complex evolution of HH objects over the period of a few years, as parts of the nebula fade while others brighten as they collide with the clumpy material of the interstellar medium.

First observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, Herbig–Haro objects were recognised as a distinct type of emission nebula in the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed the objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process. Although HH objects are visible-wavelength phenomena, many remain invisible at these wavelengths due to dust and gas, and can only be detected at infrared wavelengths. Such objects, when observed in near-infrared, are called molecular hydrogen emission-line objects (MHOs).

== Discovery and history of observations ==
The first HH object was observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, when he observed the star T Tauri with the refracting telescope at Lick Observatory and noted a small patch of nebulosity nearby. It was thought to be an emission nebula, later becoming known as Burnham&#x27;s Nebula, and was not recognized as a distinct class of object. T Tauri was found to be a very young and variable star, and is the prototype of the class of similar objects known as T Tauri stars which have yet to reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium between gravitational collapse and energy generation through nuclear fusion at their centres. Fifty years after Burnham&#x27;s discovery, several similar nebulae were discovered with almost star-like appearance. Both George Herbig and Guillermo Haro made independent observations of several of these objects in the Orion Nebula during the 1940s. Herbig also looked at Burnham&#x27;s Nebula and found it displayed an unusual electromagnetic spectrum, with prominent emission lines of hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Haro found that all the objects of this type were invisible in infrared light.

Following their independent discoveries, Herbig and Haro met at an astronomy conference in Tucson, Arizona in December 1949. Herbig had initially paid little attention to the objects he had discovered, being primarily concerned with the nearby stars, but on hearing Haro&#x27;s findings he carried out more detailed studies of them. The Soviet astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian gave the objects their name (Herbig–Haro objects, normally shortened to HH objects), and based on their occurrence near young stars (a few hundred thousand years old), suggested they might represent an early stage in the formation of T Tauri stars. Studies of the HH objects showed they were highly ionised, and early theorists speculated that they were reflection nebulae containing low-luminosity hot stars deep inside. But the absence of infrared radiation from the nebulae meant there could not be stars within them, as these would have emitted abundant infrared light. In 1975 American astronomer R. D. Schwartz theorized that winds from T Tauri stars produce shocks in the ambient medium on encounter, resulting in generation of visible light. With the discovery of the first proto-stellar jet in HH 46/47, it became clear that HH objects are indeed shock-induced phenomena with shocks being driven by a collimated jet from protostars.

== Formation ==

Stars form by gravitational collapse of interstellar gas clouds. As the collapse increases the density, radiative energy loss decreases due to increased opacity. This raises the temperature of the cloud which prevents further collapse, and a hydrostatic equilibrium is established. Gas continues to fall towards the core in a rotating disk. The core of this system is called a protostar. Some of the accreting material is ejected out along the star&#x27;s axis of rotation in two jets of partially ionised gas (plasma). The mechanism for producing these collimated bipolar jets is not entirely understood, but it is believed that interaction between the accretion disk and the stellar magnetic field accelerates some of the accreting material from within a few astronomical units of the star away from the disk plane. At these distances the outflow is divergent, fanning out at an angle in the range of 10−30°, but it becomes increasingly collimated at distances of tens to hundreds of astronomical units from the source, as its expansion is constrained. The jets also carry away the excess angular momentum resulting from accretion of material onto the star, which would otherwise cause the star to rotate too rapidly and disintegrate. When these jets collide with the interstellar medium, they give rise to the small patches of bright emission which comprise HH objects.

== Properties ==

Electromagnetic emission from HH objects is caused when their associated shock waves collide with the interstellar medium, creating what is called the &quot;terminal working surfaces&quot;. The spectrum is continuous, but also has intense emission lines of neutral and ionized species. Spectroscopic observations of HH objects&#x27; doppler shifts indicate velocities of several hundred kilometers per second, but the emission lines in those spectra are weaker than what would be expected from such high-speed collisions. This suggests that some of the material they are colliding with is also moving along the beam, although at a lower speed. Spectroscopic observations of HH objects show they are moving away from the source stars at speeds of several hundred kilometres per second. In recent years, the high optical resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed the proper motion (movement along the sky plane) of many HH objects in observations spaced several years apart. As they move away from the parent star, HH objects evolve significantly, varying in brightness on timescales of a few years. Individual compact knots or clumps within an object may brighten and fade or disappear entirely, while new knots have been seen to appear. These arise likely because of the precession of their jets, along with the pulsating and intermittent eruptions from their parent stars. Faster jets catch up with earlier slower jets, creating the so-called &quot;internal working surfaces&quot;, where streams of gas collide and generate shock waves and consequent emissions.

The total mass being ejected by stars to form typical HH objects is estimated to be of the order of 10−8 to 10−6  per year, a very small amount of material compared to the mass of the stars themselves but amounting to about 1–10% of the total mass accreted by the source stars in a year. Mass loss tends to decrease with increasing age of the source. The temperatures observed in HH objects are typically about 9,000–12,000 K, similar to those found in other ionized nebulae such as H II regions and planetary nebulae. Densities, on the other hand, are higher than in other nebulae, ranging from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of particles per cm3, compared to a few thousand particles per cm3 in most H II regions and planetary nebulae.

Densities also decrease as the source evolves over time. HH objects consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, which account for about 75% and 24% of their mass respectively. Around 1% of the mass of HH objects is made up of heavier chemical elements, including oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, iron, calcium and magnesium. Abundances of these elements, determined from emission lines of respective ions, are generally similar to their cosmic abundances. Many chemical compounds found in the surrounding interstellar medium, but not present in the source material, such as metal hydrides, are believed to have been produced by shock-induced chemical reactions. Around 20–30% of the gas in HH objects is ionized near the source star, but this proportion decreases at increasing distances. This implies the material is ionized in the polar jet, and recombines as it moves away from the star, rather than being ionized by later collisions. Shocking at the end of the jet can re-ionise some material, giving rise to bright &quot;caps&quot;.

== Numbers and distribution ==

HH objects are named approximately in order of their identification; HH 1/2 being the earliest such objects to be identified. More than a thousand individual objects are now known. They are always present in star-forming H II regions, and are often found in large groups. They are typically observed near Bok globules (dark nebulae which contain very young stars) and often emanate from them. Several HH objects have been seen near a single energy source, forming a string of objects along the line of the polar axis of the parent star. The number of known HH objects has increased rapidly over the last few years, but that is a very small proportion of the estimated up to 150,000 in the Milky Way, the vast majority of which are too far away to be resolved. Most HH objects lie within about one parsec of their parent star. Many, however, are seen several parsecs away.

HH 46/47 is located about away from the Sun and is powered by a class I protostar binary. The bipolar jet is slamming into the surrounding medium at a velocity of 300 kilometers per second, producing two emission caps about apart. Jet outflow is accompanied by a long molecular gas outflow which is swept up by the jet itself. Infrared studies by Spitzer Space Telescope have revealed a variety of chemical compounds in the molecular outflow, including water (ice), methanol, methane, carbon dioxide (dry ice) and various silicates. Located around away in the Orion A molecular cloud, HH 34 is produced by a highly collimated bipolar jet powered by a class I protostar. Matter in the jet is moving at about 220 kilometers per second. Two bright bow shocks, separated by about , are present on the opposite sides of the source, followed by series of fainter ones at larger distances, making the whole complex about long. The jet is surrounded by a long weak molecular outflow near the source.

== Source stars ==

The stars from which HH jets are emitted are all very young stars, a few tens of thousands to about a million years old. The youngest of these are still protostars in the process of collecting from their surrounding gases. Astronomers divide these stars into classes 0, I, II and III, according to how much infrared radiation the stars emit. A greater amount of infrared radiation implies a larger amount of cooler material surrounding the star, which indicates it is still coalescing. The numbering of the classes arises because class 0 objects (the youngest) were not discovered until classes I, II and III had already been defined.

Class 0 objects are only a few thousand years old; so young that they are not yet undergoing nuclear fusion reactions at their centres. Instead, they are powered only by the gravitational potential energy released as material falls onto them. They mostly contain molecular outflows with low velocities (less than a hundred kilometres per second) and weak emissions in the outflows. Nuclear fusion has begun in the cores of Class I objects, but gas and dust are still falling onto their surfaces from the surrounding nebula, and most of their luminosity is accounted for by gravitational energy. They are generally still shrouded in dense clouds of dust and gas, which obscure all their visible light and as a result can only be observed at infrared and radio wavelengths. Outflows from this class are dominated by ionized species and velocities can range up to 400 kilometres per second. The in-fall of gas and dust has largely finished in Class II objects (Classical T Tauri stars), but they are still surrounded by disks of dust and gas, and produce weak outflows of low luminosity. Class III objects (Weak-line T Tauri stars) have only trace remnants of their original accretion disk.

About 80% of the stars giving rise to HH objects are binary or multiple systems (two or more stars orbiting each other), which is a much higher proportion than that found for low mass stars on the main sequence. This may indicate that binary systems are more likely to generate the jets which give rise to HH objects, and evidence suggests the largest HH outflows might be formed when multiple–star systems disintegrate. It is thought that most stars originate from multiple star systems, but that a sizable fraction of these systems are disrupted before their stars reach the main sequence due to gravitational interactions with nearby stars and dense clouds of gas.

The first and currently only (as of May 2017) large-scale Herbig-Haro object around a proto-brown dwarf is HH 1165, which is connected to the proto-brown dwarf Mayrit 1701117. HH 1165 has a length of 0.8 light-years (0.26 parsec) and is located in the vicinity of the sigma Orionis cluster. Previously only small mini-jets (≤0.03 parsec) were found around proto-brown dwarfs.

== Infrared counterparts ==

HH objects associated with very young stars or very massive protostars are often hidden from view at optical wavelengths by the cloud of gas and dust from which they form. The intervening material can diminish the visual magnitude by factors of tens or even hundreds at optical wavelengths. Such deeply embedded objects can only be observed at infrared or radio wavelengths, usually in the frequencies of hot molecular hydrogen or warm carbon monoxide emission. In recent years, infrared images have revealed dozens of examples of &quot;infrared HH objects&quot;. Most look like bow waves (similar to the waves at the head of a ship), and so are usually referred to as molecular &quot;bow shocks&quot;. The physics of infrared bow shocks can be understood in much the same way as that of HH objects, since these objects are essentially the same – supersonic shocks driven by collimated jets from the opposite poles of a protostar. It is only the conditions in the jet and surrounding cloud that are different, causing infrared emission from molecules rather than optical emission from atoms and ions. 

In 2009 the acronym &quot;MHO&quot;, for Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Object, was approved for such objects, detected in near-infrared, by the International Astronomical Union Working Group on Designations, and has been entered into their on-line Reference Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects. As of 2010, almost 1000 objects are contained in the MHO catalog.

<doc id="1123622" wikidata="Q5709326" url="?curid=1123622" title="Helmet of Constantine">
<text>The Helmet of Constantine was a form of helmet worn by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, now lost, which featured in his imperial iconography. According to a story recorded by Ambrose and others, it included relics gathered in the Holy Land by his mother, Empress Helena. Constantine&#x27;s conversion to Christianity, which happened around AD 300, was of great importance. In this period it was believed that touching the body of the deceased or even something that came in contact with the person who had died was said to have special powers. This belief started a movement to find these relics to protect churches, cities, and even people.

==History==
At the time, Constantine I was thought to be protected due to the relic in his possession. The helmet that he wore was said to have a piece of the True Cross that Jesus was crucified on. After Constantine was made Caesar, he issued the Edict of Milan (313), sending his mother Helena to find the True Cross and to send back what she found. Helena found the cross and sent three nails that were used in the crucifixion of Jesus back to Rome and her son Constantine.

The helmet that Constantine wore included one of the Holy Nails that Saint Helena found at the crucifixion site. By making the helmet with one of the nails, it was supposed to protect him from any harm. Not only was it a sign of protection, but it was also said to fulfil the prophecy of Zechariah. The prophecy located in the fourteenth chapter of the Book of Zechariah said that one would come who engraved “Holiness to the Lord” on both the bells of the horses and headpiece of the man. At this time, the Roman emperor had the holiest relics known to man.

A rare silver medallion dated 315 AD shows Constantine with a chi-rho symbol as the crest of his helmet, and Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; records that he often wore such a helmet in later life, although it is not visible in other bronze coins. Constantine was very aware of this, and let the entire Roman Empire know that he was the owner of this holy helmet. The emperor had coins made with the image of him wearing his helmet on the front. On every VLLP coin that was made, Constantine was shown wearing his helmet. This was one way that Constantine moved the Roman Empire away from the pagan religion and towards Christianity. The coins that were made after Constantine acquired his helmet showed that the nail was not the only thing that made his helmet religious. Constantine also had the Christogram inscribed on the helmet. There were also a few religious symbols that were placed on the helmet. The Christogram was placed on the helmet, which usually represented the cross, but at times it was interpreted as Jesus Christ himself. Another one of these symbols was a labarum piercing a dragon, a serpent. This was significant because the serpent was represented as the Devil. But it was also the symbol for any enemy that the Roman Empire had. Constantine&#x27;s helmet stood for the strength that the Roman Empire had through military force, and God. The helmet was put on the coins to let everyone know of this.
Constantine&#x27;s helmet was mainly a crown that was fastened to the head by two clamps. The majority of the helmet was made out of iron and gold. Constantine thought having the chi-roh symbol on the helmet would give him added protection to that of the relic that was already in the helmet. The crown that was made with the nail was placed around a full helmet when the Emperor went into battle, but could easily be taken off. It was called a helmet; however, he wore it. This is because of the two clamps that held it in place. If these two clamps were not on the original crown it would not be called a helmet at all.

<doc id="1123625" wikidata="Q8141984" url="?curid=1123625" title="General-purpose bomb">
<text>A general-purpose bomb is an air-dropped bomb intended as a compromise between blast damage, penetration, and fragmentation in explosive effect. They are designed to be effective against enemy troops, vehicles, and buildings.

==Characteristics==
General-purpose (GP) bombs use a thick-walled metal casing with explosive filler (typically TNT, Composition B, or Tritonal in NATO or United States service) comprising about 30% to 40% of the bomb&#x27;s total weight. The British term for a bomb of this type is &quot;medium case&quot; or &quot;medium capacity&quot; (MC). The GP bomb is a common weapon of fighter bomber and attack aircraft because it is useful for a variety of tactical applications and relatively cheap.

General-purpose bombs are often identified by their weight (e.g., ). In many cases this is strictly a &quot;nominal weight&quot; (the counterpart to the &quot;caliber&quot; of a firearm), and the actual weight of each individual weapon may vary depending on its retardation, fusing, carriage, and guidance systems. For example, the actual weight of a U.S. M117 bomb, nominally , is typically around .

Most modern air-dropped GP bombs are designed to minimise drag for external carriage on aircraft lacking bomb bays.

In low-altitude attacks, there is a danger of the attacking aircraft being caught in the blast of its own weapons. To address this problem, GP bombs are often fitted with &quot;retarders&quot;, parachutes or pop-out fins that slow the bomb&#x27;s descent to allow the aircraft time to escape the detonation.

GP bombs can be fitted with a variety of fuzes and fins for different uses. One notable example is the &quot;daisy cutter&quot; fuze used in Vietnam War era American weapons, an extended probe designed to ensure that the bomb would detonate on contact (even with foliage) rather than burying itself in earth or mud, which would reduce its effectiveness. (This was not the first instance of such devices. As early as World War II, the Luftwaffe was using extended-nose fuzes on bombs dropped by Stuka dive-bombers and other aircraft for exactly the same reason. A blast several feet above the ground is many times more effective and has a far greater radius than one that is delayed until the bomb is below the surface.)

GP bombs are commonly used as the warheads for more sophisticated precision-guided munitions. Using various types of seeker and electrically controlled fins turns a basic &#x27;iron&#x27; bomb into a laser-guided bomb (like the U.S. Paveway series), an electro-optical guided bomb, or, more recently, GPS-guided weapon (like the U.S. JDAM). The combination is cheaper than a true guided missile (and can be more easily upgraded or replaced in service), but is substantially more accurate than an unguided bomb.

== Historic general-purpose bombs ==
===WWII-era British general-purpose bombs===
During WWII the British adopted a description of general-purpose bombs as medium capacity (MC) bombs. The MC was developed from 1942 to replace the existing 1000 lb GP (General Purpose) bomb. Initially using most of the components of the 1000 lb GP it was decided to give it a new tail and it was built with a half-inch-thick wall. Fillings could be Amatex, Amatol, Minol, RDX and others. Actual weight was around .
It was introduced to service in 1943 and about a quarter of a million were produced by the end of the war.
* General-Purpose bomb – produced 1937 to 1941
* General-Purpose Bomb – not produced
* General-Purpose Bomb – abandoned project
* General-Purpose Bomb (1926 onwards) – replaced by 250 lb MC in 1942
* General-Purpose Bomb (1926 onwards) – replaced by 500 lb MC in 1942
* General-Purpose Bomb (1939 onwards) – replaced by 1000 lb MC in 1943
* General-Purpose Bomb (1941 onwards)
* General-Purpose Bomb (1943) – replaced by 4000 lb HC

== Modern general-purpose bombs==

===Modern American general-purpose bombs: the Mark 80 series===

During the Korean War and Vietnam War the U.S. used older designs like the M65, M117 and M118, which had an explosive content about 65% higher than most contemporary weapons. Although some of these weapons remain in the U.S. arsenal, they are little used and the M117 is primarily carried only by the B-52 Stratofortress.

The primary U.S. GP bombs are the Mark 80 series. This class of weapons uses a shape known as Aero 1A, designed by Ed Heinemann of Douglas Aircraft as the result of studies in 1946. It has a length-to-diameter ratio of about 8:1, and results in minimal drag for the carrier aircraft. The Mark 80 series was not used in combat until the Vietnam War, but has since replaced most earlier GP weapons. It includes four basic weapon types:

* Mark 81 – nominal weight 
* Mark 82 – nominal weight 
* Mark 83 – nominal weight 
* Mark 84 – nominal weight 

Vietnam service showed the Mk 81 &quot;Firecracker&quot; to be sub par, and it was withdrawn from U.S. service. However, recently, precision-guided variants of the Mk 81 bomb have begun a return to service, based on U.S. experience in Iraq after 2003, and the desire to reduce collateral damage compared to Mk 82 and larger bombs (e.g., when attacking a single small building in a populated area).

Since the Vietnam War and the 1967 USS Forrestal fire, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps GP bombs are distinguished by a thick ablative fire-retardant coating, which is designed to delay any potential accidental explosion in the event of a shipboard fire. Land-based air forces typically do not use such coatings, largely because they add some to the weight of the complete weapon. Fire is less a danger in a land-based facility, where the personnel can be evacuated with relative ease, and the building be the only loss. At sea, the crew and munitions share a facility (the ship), and thus are in much more danger of fire reaching munitions (which tend to be more closely packed, due to space limitations). Also, losing a munitions storage building on land is far cheaper than sacrificing an entire naval vessel, even if one could easily evacuate the crew.

All Mk 80 bombs have both nose and tail fuze wells and can accept a variety of fuzes. Various nose and tail kits can be fitted to adapt the weapon for a variety of roles.

Mk 80 series bomb bodies are also used in the following weapons:
* BDU-50 A practice (no explosive) version of the Mk 82 bomb body
* BDU-56 A practice (no explosive) version of the Mk 84 bomb body
On August 14, 2020, Kaman Precision Products received roughly $57.3 million for a &quot;cockpit-selectable&quot; bomb fuze to be used on Mark 80 warheads (guided and unguided). The contract involved foreign military sales (FMS) to 25 unnamed countries.

====Smart bomb kits====
Dumb Mk 80 bombs could be converted to &quot;smart bombs&quot; with attached kits:
* GBU-12D Paveway II (Mk 82) laser-guided
* GBU-16B Paveway II (Mk 83) laser-guided
* GBU-24B Paveway III (Mk 84) laser-guided
* GBU-38 JDAM (Mk 82) INS/GPS guided
* GBU-32 JDAM (Mk 83) INS/GPS guided
* GBU-31 JDAM (Mk 84) INS/GPS guided
* GBU-X - a guided general-purpose bomb under development as of 2017

====Retarded (high drag) versions====
* &quot;Mk 82 Snake Eye&quot; was a standard Mk 82 with folded retarding petals.
* &quot;Mk 82 Retarded&quot; was a standard Mk 82 with a ballute.
* &quot;Mk 83 Retarded&quot; was a standard Mk 83 with a ballute.
* &quot;Mk 84 Retarded&quot; was a standard Mk 84 with a ballute.
The retarder is used to allow the aircraft escape the &quot;blast pattern&quot; in low altitude delivery.

===Modern British general-purpose bombs===
The principal modern British bombs are and , and are no longer in service. The smaller 540 lb was retired with the demise of the Harrier GR9 aircraft with the larger 1000 lb being retired in Apr 2019. Currently the UK only uses the 500 lb class Paveway IV weapon system. The warhead is a modified enhanced Mk 82 warhead.

===Soviet and Russian general-purpose bombs===


The Russian term for general-purpose bomb is &quot;fugasnaya aviatsionnaya bomba&quot; (FAB) and followed by the bomb&#x27;s nominal weight in kilograms. Most Russian iron bombs have circular ring airfoils rather than the fins used by Western types.

In 1946 the Soviet Union developed a series of freefall bombs in four sizes , , , and and sharing a single nose and a single tail fuze. The bomb could be dropped from up to and up to . The original, 1946-series bombs had poor ballistic characteristics at supersonic speed, and their construction was fragile. As an interim measure, upgraded versions of the bombs were built with thicker walls and no nose fuze. The thick-walled version of the bombs was built until 1956.

The 1954 series of high-drag bombs was built in six sizes: , , , , , and . A feature of the 1954 series of bombs is the ballistic ring on the nose of the bomb which acts as a vortex generator to aid the bomb&#x27;s stabilizers. The smaller (less than ) bombs had a single nose and a single tail fuze, while the larger weapons shared a single nose fuze and two base fuzes. The FAB-9000 () weapon was roughly comparable to the wartime Grand Slam bomb. It was used by Soviet aircraft designers as a substitute for early nuclear weapons when determining the size and clearances of bomb bays.

In 1962 a new series of streamlined, low-drag bombs was introduced, designed for external carriage by fighter-bomber aircraft rather than in internal bays. They come in only two sizes, and . Both bombs have a single nose fuze.

Both the 54 and 62 series designs remain in use. The most common of these are the FAB-100, FAB-250, FAB-500, and FAB-1500, roughly corresponding to the U.S. Mark 80 series. These have seen widespread service in Russia, Warsaw Pact nations, and various export countries.

Larger bombs with less streamlined shapes also remained in the Soviet arsenal, primarily for use by heavy bombers. In the Iran–Iraq War, FAB-5000 () and FAB-9000 () bombs were dropped by Iraqi Air Force Tupolev Tu-22 bombers, generally against large, fixed targets in Iran. In Afghanistan in the 1980s, Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 and Tupolev Tu-22M bombers used massive FAB-1500, FAB-3000, FAB-5000NG, and FAB-9000 bombs to devastating effect during the Panjshir offensives. More recently, many Russian FAB-500 and FAB-1500 general-purpose bombs were converted to precision munitions through the addition of mass-produced so-called UMPK kits, which add battery-powered electrically actuated pop-out wings and flight control surfaces as well as guidance electronics, all of whose addition turns unguided gravity bombs into smart bombs with a glide ratio comparable to that of the Space Shuttle.

On 20 June 2024, Russia claimed that it used, for the first time, a FAB-3000 modified with a guidance wing kit near Lyptsi in Kharkiv Oblast. Russian media claimed that it was aimed at Ukrainian soldiers, Ukraine claimed that it narrowly missed a hospital. Russia announced that it was restarting production of the FAB-3000 in March 2024. More purported uses of the bomb in the same region took place in the next days with videos appeared online. The Russian Ministry of Defense officially announced the use of the bomb on 14 July 2024 by publishing a video which showed a Su-34 tactical bomber launching it.

===French general-purpose bombs===

France produces or has produced numerous types of general-purpose bombs with weights ranging from to , including US Mark 80 models.

Until 2011, bomb casings were made by the &quot;Société des Ateliers Mécaniques de Pont-sur-Sambre&quot;. The acronym “SAMP” identifies these bombs, along with various type codes such as EU2 and T200. Since 2019, bomb casings are made at a new factory in Rouvignies and are filled with explosives at another factory in Sorgues.

=== Indian general-purpose bombs ===
India&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed the High Speed Low Drag Bomb or HSLD series of general-purpose bombs. Size variations of these bombs are , , and . The 450 kg and 500 kg bombs have precision-guided versions as well. The bombs are manufactured by Munitions India Limited.

===Other nations===
Other countries, including Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Chile, Greece, Israel, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey, manufacture their own bombs, most of which are either licensed versions of the U.S. Mark 80 series or close copies.

<text>The 2004 Canadian Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 13 June 2004 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. It was Race 8 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

It was won by Michael Schumacher, with teammate Rubens Barrichello second, making for a 1-2 finish for Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro as part of a season where Ferrari took the most wins of the season and the driver&#x27;s championship.

In the post race inspections, Williams and Toyota were excluded from the race due to illegal brake ducts.

This would be the last time that Scuderia Ferrari won in Canada until the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix, at the same circuit.

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but were not scheduled to compete in qualifying or the race.

== Report ==
The 2004 Canadian Grand Prix nearly did not happen, originally being dropped from the calendar in 2003 but later reinstated. The issue was to do with tobacco sponsorship.

It was the eighth race of the 2004 Formula One season, and was the first of two North American consecutive rounds. The Canadian Grand Prix 2004 was one of drama, but at the finish line Michael Schumacher took his 77th career victory, his 7th win of the 2004 season, and his 7th win in Canada. Timo Glock made his debut replacing Giorgio Pantano who did not compete due to personal circumstances. The Renaults were fast off the line as was expected, but a suspension failure put Jarno Trulli out of the race before he&#x27;d reached the second corner. Takuma Sato starting from the pit lane had a close shave with the two Jaguars and David Coulthard. Christian Klien&#x27;s Jaguar was hit from behind, propelling him into the McLaren of Coulthard, which also resulted in a collision with Mark Webber who was forced to pit with a punctured tyre, but later retired with suspension failure.

After the start, Fernando Alonso was up to third behind pole sitter Ralf Schumacher and Jenson Button. Jordan debutante Timo Glock took advantage of the second corner tangle and managed to find himself in 10th. As the race progressed, Rubens Barrichello moved ahead of Kimi Räikkönen into 6th position, as Glock was forced back by faster cars. Sauber&#x27;s Felipe Massa battled with the ailing Takuma Sato for 14th, as Coulthard moved up to 12th, with the Toyotas in a strong 8th and 9th. The McLaren&#x27;s were first to pit as part of their three stop strategy, followed shortly by Button and Montoya. Ralf Schumacher was 5 seconds ahead of Alonso until he pitted and rejoined in fourth, whilst Alonso&#x27;s podium hopes were later dashed by a problem with the fuel hose which forced the Renault pit crew to resort to the spare hose, costing Alonso an additional 16 seconds. Räikkönen&#x27;s afternoon couldn&#x27;t get much worse, as he served a drive through penalty for crossing the white line on his exit from the pit lane. Barrichello later rejoined after his first pit stop behind Montoya, to make the running order Ralf Schumacher, Jenson Button, Michael Schumacher, Juan Pablo Montoya, Rubens Barrichello and Fernando Alonso.

Nick Heidfeld was involved in an incident in the pit lane where the lollipop man lifted whilst the fuel hose was still attached, and the fuel man Mick Gomme was dragged along as the Jordan pulled away. The Saubers were on a long first stint and Giancarlo Fisichella did not pit until lap 25, surprisingly rejoining in the points. Meanwhile, Button was closing the gap to Ralf Schumacher, as Montoya did likewise to Ralf&#x27;s older brother Michael.

Minardi&#x27;s Gianmaria Bruni was hauled in for a drive through penalty for speeding in the pit lane, but retired with gearbox failure shortly after. Ralf pitted again on lap 33, and rejoined in 3rd whilst Coulthard narrowly missed another collision with a fiery Christian Klien. In the second stint, Barrichello was seemingly much faster than his teammate Michael Schumacher, but could not find a way past the reigning champion. Alonso began to fly in fourth, as the adventurous Klien took an airborne trip over the grass. Alonso&#x27;s charge was short-lived though, as his Renault pulled slowly to the side of the circuit with a driveshaft failure. Räikkönen, Barrichello and Michael Schumacher took their second pit stops without much hassle, although Schumacher had a leary moment when he almost hit the pit wall.

Ralf Schumacher then took his third and final stop, and so too did Montoya and Button. Takuma Sato&#x27;s disappointing afternoon ended with the Honda engine exploding. As the final stages of the race approached, Michael Schumacher led brother Ralf, with Barrichello, Button, and Montoya following, and Räikkönen in sixth. Räikkönen then had to make yet another pit stop to change his steering wheel, dropping the Finn down to 7th.

With a few laps left to go, Felipe Massa suffered a rear suspension failure at the hairpin, a wheel flying beyond the retaining fence (nobody was injured) as his Sauber flew into the tyre barrier. The Brazilian was taken to hospital for precautionary tests, but was basically unharmed. Christian Klien continued an entertaining afternoon by spinning 360 degrees, narrowly avoiding a surprised Timo Glock.

The front runners remained the same until the chequered flag, Michael Schumacher and Scuderia Ferrari coming away with a 7th victory of the season. Younger brother Ralf, and Barrichello completed the podium portrait. Jenson Button ended the race in 4th, and Montoya finished in 5th. Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s quiet race ended with an impressive 6th, with Räikkönen taking two points for seventh and Toyota&#x27;s Cristiano da Matta taking the final point for 8th.

After the race, however, both Toyota&#x27;s and Williams&#x27;s cars were disqualified with brake irregularities, brake ducts seemingly not conforming to regulations. After the disqualification, Jenson Button claimed 3rd, with Giancarlo Fisichella taking 4th, Räikkönen and Coulthard taking 5th and 6th, and Glock and Nick Heidfeld in 7th and 8th respectively, giving Jordan points.

<text>The 2004 United States Grand Prix (officially the 2004 Formula 1 United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on June 20, 2004 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. It was Race 9 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

Rubens Barrichello started from pole position in his Ferrari ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. However, following a start-line incident between five cars, four of whom retired as a result, Schumacher overtook Barrichello on the safety car restart on lap six, and despite a threat from Barrichello after the final pit stops, Schumacher held on to take his eighth win of the season. Takuma Sato became only the second Japanese driver to achieve a podium finish.

The race saw two serious accidents caused by Michelin tire failures in what would be a precedent for the 2005 United States Grand Prix, at which all Michelin-shod cars withdrew over safety concerns. First, Fernando Alonso&#x27;s Renault crashed into the barriers alongside the end of the pit straight on lap nine. Later, Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Williams suffered the same fate, but in the most dangerous part of the track, causing him to hit the wall at a ninety-degree angle rearwards. The impact left Schumacher with spinal fractures and concussion, which prevented him from racing until the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix, three months later.

==Report==

===Background===
Heading into round nine, the season had so far belonged to Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari, winning all but one race, in Monaco, owing to a crash with Juan Pablo Montoya, and so had 70 points out of a possible 80. However, Rubens Barrichello, Schumacher&#x27;s teammate at Ferrari, was only 16 points behind him, having taken six podiums and two other points finishes. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, however, Ferrari were dominating, with 124 points: more than double that of second-placed Renault, the only other team to win a Grand Prix that year so far, with Jarno Trulli triumphing in Monaco. Third-placed BAR had a quick car, but suffered reliability problems. Lead driver Jenson Button, like his future teammate Barrichello, picking up six podiums and two other points finishes. However, of the eight races so far, Takuma Sato, in the other BAR, had suffered five engine failures, three of which had occurred in the preceding three Grands Prix in Monaco, Europe, and Canada.

Williams and Toyota had been disqualified from the last event in Canada for illegal brake ducts, even though, in Williams&#x27;s case, this proved to be a manufacturing error and had not given them any aerodynamic or cooling gain.

===Friday drivers===
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

===Practice and qualifying===

Four practice sessions were held before qualifying - two 60-minute sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. All of the teams, with the exception of Ferrari, Williams, McLaren, and Renault, were permitted to run three drivers on Friday. Rubens Barrichello topped the timesheets in practices one, two, and three, with times of 1:11.354, 1:10.365, and 1:10.911 respectively. Jenson Button, driving for BAR, however, prevented Barrichello from a clean sweep in the second Saturday session: his time of 1:10.056 was 0.143 quicker than second-placed Michael Schumacher. Third was Takuma Sato, Button&#x27;s teammate, whilst Barrichello languished in fourth. However, despite the pace of the Ferraris, their Bridgestone tires had grained in the long runs, meaning that balls of rubber would form on the surface of the tire, reducing mechanical grip.
Qualifying was split into two sections. In the first session, dubbed &quot;pre-qualifying&quot;, each driver took turns to record one lap at a time. The order the cars ran in was the reverse order to the classified results at the 2004 Canadian Grand Prix. For example, Michael Schumacher won the race, so would be the last car to run in pre-qualifying. The second qualifying session (dubbed &quot;qualifying&quot;) repeated this process (with the drivers running in reverse order to the pre-qualifying results), but with the caveat that the drivers would not be allowed to alter their fuel loads between then and the race. The fastest time in the second session would take pole. As in 2003, setups and fuel loads could not be altered between the end of the second qualifying session and the race. Rubens Barrichello started from pole from teammate Michael Schumacher after setting a time of 1:10:223. Michael Schumacher started second, making it an all-Ferrari front row. BAR locked out the second row, with Takuma Sato lining up ahead of team leader Jenson Button. Williams locked out row three, with Juan Pablo Montoya in fifth, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. A gearbox issue prevented Jarno Trulli in the Renault from setting a lap, meaning he started last. Jean Todt had told the media that Barrichello would be allowed to race Schumacher and would not be forced to concede to him, as in the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix.

===Race===
As the formation lap began, Juan Pablo Montoya&#x27;s Williams failed to start. Montoya jumped out of the car and ran to the pits to use the spare car; it was set up for him as he was higher up on the grid than his teammate. Montoya started the race from the pit lane.

Rubens Barrichello led into the first corner from pole position. Michael Schumacher retained second place. Fernando Alonso started in ninth place on the grid, but went around the outside of the similarly fast-starting Kimi Räikkönen in the McLaren, and then used the inside line at turn two to pass Takuma Sato and move into third place. Jenson Button dropped from fourth to sixth, whilst Ralf Schumacher dropped to seventh. Jarno Trulli moved up to eleventh place, having started last, partially helped by a big crash in turn two. A gear selection issue for Cristiano da Matta meant that he lost momentum, and an unsighted Christian Klien ploughed into the back of him and speared across the track, hitting Giorgio Pantano&#x27;s Jordan and Felipe Massa&#x27;s Sauber. Nick Heidfeld in the other Jordan attempted to avoid the chaos, and squeezed Gianmaria Bruni&#x27;s Minardi onto the kerb, terminally damaging the suspension of the Minardi. The safety car was deployed, and remained out until the end of lap five.
As the safety car came in, Michael Schumacher overtook Barrichello for the lead of the race. On lap nine, Fernando Alonso, in a Michelin-shod Renault, crashed out from third place at the end of the main straight after his right rear tire deflated under braking. He lost control of the car and it crashed nose-first into the barriers along the track, destroying the front end of the Renault and some polystyrene boards at turn one. Double yellow flags were deployed, meaning the drivers were not allowed to overtake in that zone. At the end of lap ten, the Williams of Ralf Schumacher, also on Michelin tires, suffered a tire failure in turn thirteen, the only banked corner at the time in Formula One, backing the car into the wall at a ninety-degree angle. The car skidded several hundred metres down the race track before coming to rest. Schumacher sat motionless in the car for two minutes, unable to talk to his team over the radio, as the radio had been smashed in the incident. The safety car was deployed, and most of the drivers opted to make an early pit stop. Michael Schumacher pitted, as did his teammate Barrichello, but Barrichello had to queue behind Schumacher, and also struggled to get going from the stop, costing him track position to Kimi Räikkönen, who also pitted. As he left the pit lane, David Coulthard ran over a piece of debris from Alonso&#x27;s Renault. Michael Schumacher now led the race from Takuma Sato, Jenson Button, and Juan Pablo Montoya, none of whom had made a pit stop. Kimi Räikkönen was now fifth, ahead of Barrichello in sixth, Trulli in seventh place, and Olivier Panis in the last points position in eighth.
The safety car pulled in at the end of lap nineteen, and as the BARs had not stopped, they were pressuring Michael Schumacher&#x27;s much heavier Ferrari: the top three were within two seconds of each other for a long period of time. Takuma Sato was very quick through the first and second sectors of the lap, but Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari had good traction out of turn eleven, the only overtaking opportunity, and so Sato was unable to pass. On lap 24, Button was the first BAR to make a pit stop. Button&#x27;s arrival in his pit box was messy, causing him to lose a couple of seconds whilst his mechanics readjusted their positions. Sato pitted one lap later, and had a clean stop, rejoining in eleventh place, just in front of Button in twelfth. Sato had good traction, however, out of turn seven on his out lap, and overtook Mark Webber&#x27;s Jaguar to move up to tenth. On the same lap, he overtook David Coulthard through turn thirteen, finishing off the move into turn one on lap twenty seven. Mark Webber ran wide at turn one, gifting a place to Button. However, BAR&#x27;s reliability problems continued: Button retired at the end of lap twenty seven with a gearbox issue. On lap 29, Sato repeated his move on Webber on Giancarlo Fisichella, and moved into a points position. A few corners later, he passed Nick Heidfeld and moved into seventh.
Räikkönen made his second stop of the race at the end of lap 29, rejoining in eleventh place, behind Webber. On lap 31, he moved past Webber, and into tenth place, behind David Coulthard. One lap later, the McLarens swapped positions, as Räikkönen moved into ninth. However, Räikkönen had to make yet another pit stop at the end of lap thirty four due to an electronics problem on his car. The stop lasted fifteen seconds and he rejoined last. Montoya made his first pit stop at the end of lap 35, rejoining in sixth.

Michael Schumacher now led the race by thirteen seconds from Rubens Barrichello, and continued to pull away. Jarno Trulli, now in third place, drove sharply over the kerb at turn eight and lost a piece of his car on lap 38. Nick Heidfeld pitted at the end of lap 38 and rejoined the race in eleventh. Takuma Sato, meanwhile, had caught Olivier Panis&#x27;s Toyota, and overtook him on lap 40 for fourth place. Schumacher pitted at the end of lap 42 with a fifteen-second gap to his teammate, and Barrichello assumed the lead. Schumacher&#x27;s 10.3-second stop fuelled him to get to the end of the race. Barrichello then pushed hard, attempting to leapfrog Schumacher. Heidfeld retired on lap 45, and Sato pitted on the same lap for his second and final pit stop. Sato rejoined in sixth place, behind Montoya. Jarno Trulli pitted on lap 46 and rejoined in fifth place, behind Olivier Panis, although that quickly changed when Panis pitted at the end of lap 47. Panis rejoined behind Sato, and Coulthard pitted on the same lap for McLaren, rejoining in ninth.

Fisichella, on Bridgestone tires, then suffered a left rear puncture on lap 49. He took the opportunity to make his final fuel stop, rejoining near the back of the field. Barrichello had been pushing hard, and so when he finally stopped for fuel on lap 51, the gap between the two Ferraris had been cut to approximately two seconds - Barrichello had cut the gap by approximately thirteen seconds. On lap 52, Barrichello went up the inside of Schumacher in turn four, but Schumacher cut across the front of his teammate. The two cars nearly collided, and Barrichello then, contrary to Todt&#x27;s earlier statements, was told to remain behind Schumacher. The battle between the two Ferraris meant that Montoya and Trulli were catching them. Sato was, in turn, catching Trulli for fourth place. David Coulthard pitted on lap 55, and, similarly to Button, had a messy arrival. Montoya pitted on lap 56, but as he left the pit lane, he was disqualified from the race due to him changing cars too late on the grid; it was his second consecutive disqualification. Mark Webber&#x27;s engine expired on lap 60, and he coasted down the pit straight, pulling off at turn one. Takuma Sato went down the inside of Jarno Trulli on lap 61, and although they both ran on the grass, Sato moved up into third position. In attempting to recover from the excursion, Trulli spun. With eight laps to go, Fisichella retired with a hydraulics problem.
Michael Schumacher held off the threat of Barrichello to win the race, his eighth win of 2004. Barrichello finished second, and Takuma Sato became only the second Japanese driver to achieve a podium finish after Aguri Suzuki, a feat not repeated until Kamui Kobayashi in the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix. Jarno Trulli finished fourth, Panis fifth, Räikkönen sixth, and Coulthard seventh; finally, Zsolt Baumgartner became the first Hungarian driver to score a point in a Formula One race by finishing eighth.

===Post-race===
Christian Klien did not claim responsibility for the crash on lap one, claiming that he had &quot;nowhere to go&quot;. Barrichello was disappointed to have conceded the lead on the safety car restart and criticised the Ferrari technicians for indecision regarding his first pit stop, which lost him position to Kimi Räikkönen.

Juan Pablo Montoya was frustrated to have lost points for the second race running due to a disqualification beyond his control. However, he said that the pace of the car was positive and allowed Williams to push on for the rest of the season.

==Background==
The race was preceded by a demonstration of contemporary Formula One cars on Regent Street in London, including former British Formula One World Champion Nigel Mansell driving the Jordan EJ14. The event attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators.

The event was also notable for the death of Minardi Sporting Director John Walton, who died of a heart attack following the street demonstration, causing the Minardi team to withdraw its cars from Saturday&#x27;s early practice session.

<text>The 2004 German Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland 2004) was a Formula One motor race held at Hockenheim on 25 July 2004. It was Race 12 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 66-lap race was won by local driver Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari. Schumacher took his eleventh victory of the season, equalling his record from , after starting from pole position. Englishman Jenson Button finished second in a BAR-Honda despite a ten-place grid penalty for an engine change in practice, and a loose helmet strap during the race, with Spaniard Fernando Alonso third in a Renault. Kimi Räikkönen of McLaren-Mercedes set the fastest lap of the race but retired on lap 14 after his rear wing gave way at Turn 1, sending his car into the barriers at high speed. The first start was aborted after Olivier Panis indicated a problem with his Toyota. This led to a second formation lap, and the shortening of the race by one lap.

This was the final Grand Prix for Brazilian driver Cristiano da Matta, and the final time Williams used the &quot;Walrus&quot; front wing. Marc Gené was replaced at Williams by Antônio Pizzonia, returning to Formula One after being sacked by Jaguar following the 2003 British Grand Prix. Pizzonia scored his first points by finishing seventh.

<text>The 2004 Hungarian Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Marlboro Magyar Nagydíj 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 15 August 2004 at the Hungaroring, Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary. It was Race 13 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship and the 20th Hungarian Grand Prix. The 70-lap race was won from pole position by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, with teammate Rubens Barrichello second and Fernando Alonso third in a Renault.

The win was Michael Schumacher&#x27;s twelfth of the season and his seventh in succession, equalling Alberto Ascari&#x27;s record. The result meant that Schumacher increased his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 38 points over Barrichello. Jenson Button, who finished fifth in the race in his BAR-Honda, remained in third but was mathematically eliminated from the championship. Ferrari&#x27;s one-two finish meant that they secured their sixth consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship.

==Report==

===Background===

Heading into the thirteenth race of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 110 points, ahead of teammate Rubens Barrichello on 74 points and Jenson Button on 65. Jarno Trulli was fourth with 46 points with his Renault teammate Fernando Alonso in fifth place on 39 points. Ferrari were leading the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 184 points; Renault (85 points) and BAR (76) contended for second place with Williams in fourth on 47 points and McLaren were a further ten points adrift in fifth place. Ferrari had dominated the championship; Michael Schumacher had won eleven races for the team, while Trulli had clinched the victory in the Monaco Grand Prix. Barrichello, Button, Alonso, Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Räikkönen had finished in second and third positions during the season.

There was one driver change heading into the race. Cristiano da Matta was dropped by Toyota and was replaced by the team&#x27;s third driver Ricardo Zonta. Da Matta was dropped because of his poor performance relative to teammate Olivier Panis, but remained at the team as a driver and would perform marketing work while Toyota test driver Ryan Briscoe assumed Zonta&#x27;s former position.

<text>The 2004 Belgian Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 August 2004, at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, near the village of Francorchamps, Wallonia, Belgium. It was Race 14 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The race was contested over 44 laps and was won by Kimi Räikkönen, taking his and McLaren&#x27;s only race win of the season from tenth place on the grid. Second place went to Michael Schumacher, who won his seventh and final world championship, after beating third-placed Rubens Barrichello.

Jarno Trulli started from pole position alongside Schumacher. The race saw many changes of the lead, but following several fortuitous safety cars, Räikkönen was leading the race for the final few laps. Mark Webber triggered a pile-up at the start, eliminating four cars and damaging several others, although he did admit his mistake later. The race saw Christian Klien score his first championship points, and Olivier Panis and the Jaguar team their last.

==Report==

===Background===

Heading into the 14th race of the season, Michael Schumacher, driving for the Ferrari team, was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship by 38 points from teammate Rubens Barrichello. Jenson Button, driving for BAR, was in third place, but only Schumacher and Barrichello could mathematically win the championship. Ferrari had sealed the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the previous race, but the battle for second in the Championship, between Renault and BAR, was still fierce.

However, the biggest story was the controversy surrounding Button&#x27;s drive for 2005. Ten days before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Button chose to leave BAR and signed a two-year contract to return to Williams. This was surprising, as Button was enjoying his best season to date, while Williams had been struggling. BAR, however, insisted they had the right to exercise their option to keep Button. Button&#x27;s management argued that the BAR option was not valid because it contained a clause allowing him to leave if BAR risked losing their Honda engines. They felt the new contract signed in the summer for Honda to supply engines to BAR was not definitive, and thus Button was free to move.

With regard to the Spa circuit itself, the race did not take place in 2003 so that modifications to the &quot;Bus Stop&quot; chicane could be completed. Pundits were very critical of the changes to the chicane: namely, a sweeping right-hand bend has been introduced just before it. This left a huge piece of green-coloured tarmac, causing Martin Brundle to be very scathing of it during qualifying, stating &quot;you could hold an entire kart meeting in there, including transporters and trucks!&quot;

===Friday drivers===
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

===Practice===
Four practice sessions were held before qualifying – two 60-minute sessions on Friday, 27 August, and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday, 28 August. All teams, with the exception of Ferrari, Williams, McLaren, and Renault, were permitted to run three drivers on Friday. Anthony Davidson, the third driver for BAR, set the quickest time in the first practice session, 1:45.104. Räikkönen set the fastest time in practice two. Saturday practice one was cancelled due to fog, and Barrichello set the quickest time in Saturday practice two, shortened from 45 to 30 minutes as a result of the fog that had cancelled practice one. Saturday&#x27;s second practice session saw two major excursions from Antônio Pizzonia and Gianmaria Bruni, the latter causing the session to be red-flagged.

=== Qualifying ===

Qualifying was split into two sections. In the first session, dubbed &quot;pre-qualifying&quot;, each driver took turns to record one lap at a time. The order the cars ran in was the reverse order to the classified results at the 2004 Hungarian Grand Prix. For example, Michael Schumacher won the race, so would be the last car to run in pre-qualifying. The second qualifying session (dubbed &quot;qualifying&quot;) repeated this process (with the drivers running in reverse order to the pre-qualifying results), but with the caveat that the drivers would not be allowed to alter their fuel loads between then and the race. The fastest time in the second session would take pole. As in 2003, setups and fuel loads could not be altered between the end of the second qualifying session and the race. In pre-qualifying, Ricardo Zonta, driving for Toyota, spun off at &quot;Pouhon&quot; corner, leading him to collide with the tyre wall. The second part of qualifying started as being very wet but quickly dried out, enabling Jarno Trulli to switch to intermediate tyres, enabling him to set the fastest lap time. Schumacher qualified second. The conditions did not suit Jenson Button, who had run on wet tyres when the track was ready for intermediates, and Juan Pablo Montoya, who did his qualifying lap on intermediates as it began to rain.

===Race===
Trulli&#x27;s Renault had a good start from pole position, but second-placed Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari did not, and he lost positions to Fernando Alonso&#x27;s Renault and David Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren. At &quot;La Source&quot;, Mark Webber&#x27;s Jaguar collided with Barrichello&#x27;s Ferrari, causing Webber to lose his front wing and Barrichello to suffer rear wing damage. In a separate incident, Räikkönen&#x27;s McLaren made contact with Felipe Massa&#x27;s Sauber, which caused Massa to lose his front wing. In a third incident, Nick Heidfeld&#x27;s Jordan and Olivier Panis&#x27;s Toyota made contact. Going into &quot;Eau Rouge&quot;, Webber was side-by-side with Takuma Sato&#x27;s BAR, and they collided in the middle of the corner whilst they were overtaken by Montoya&#x27;s Williams. The contact broke Sato&#x27;s left rear suspension and Webber&#x27;s front right suspension. Sato consequently spun in the middle of the track. The rest of the field attempted to avoid the spinning BAR, but in doing so, Zsolt Baumgartner and Gianmaria Bruni, both driving for Minardi, made contact, putting Bruni out of the race and getting him hit by Giorgio Pantano&#x27;s Jordan. Sato, Webber, Bruni, and Pantano were out of the race. A small fire on Bruni&#x27;s car, caused by the contact with Pantano, forced the safety car to come out. During this time, Button, Massa, Barrichello, Heidfeld, Baumgartner, and Olivier Panis stopped for repairs caused by debris. Massa and Barrichello stopped twice.

The safety car came in at the end of lap four and Trulli led Alonso and Coulthard. Räikkönen overtook Schumacher for fifth position and Button overtook Ricardo Zonta&#x27;s Toyota. Schumacher continued to be slow, losing 1.1 seconds to Räikkönen in the middle sector on lap five, enabling Montoya to overtake him around the outside of the &quot;Bus Stop&quot; chicane on lap five. On lap six, Räikkönen overtook his teammate, Coulthard, for third, going up the inside at the &quot;Les Combes&quot; chicane. On lap eight, Barrichello overtook Baumgartner and Heidfeld, putting him into 14th place. Christian Klien, in the sole remaining Jaguar, was the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop, on lap nine, and race leader Trulli made a pit stop on lap 10, rejoining in ninth place. Alonso now led the race, but on lap 12 he had an oil leak and spun twice at &quot;Les Combes&quot;, losing the lead to Räikkönen. He managed to rejoin, but he then had a further spin at &quot;Rivage&quot; for the same reason and could not rejoin. On the same lap Coulthard had a rear tyre de-lamination, but he made it back to pit lane. Räikkönen stopped at the end of lap 13. Montoya now led the race from Schumacher, until Montoya pitted on lap 15. Montoya left the pit lane behind Massa, losing time while overtaking him. Schumacher pitted one lap later and leapfrogged Montoya. New leader Pizzonia came into the pits on lap 17. Räikkönen now led from Button in second, Trulli in third, and Schumacher in fourth, but Schumacher was able to overcome Trulli on lap 19.

Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s Sauber ran wide on lap 20 and lost parts of his front wing. On the same lap, Montoya attempted to repeat his earlier overtake on Trulli, but the pair collided, putting Trulli into a spin. Trulli lost several places, and Montoya lost fourth place to his teammate, Pizzonia. Button pitted on lap 21, rejoining in seventh, behind the battling Fischella and Barrichello. Barrichello then took fifth place on lap 22, as Trulli made a second pit stop, having been passed by Panis. Button was also able to pass Fisichella for sixth position on lap 23, as Barrichello pitted. Räikkönen pitted on lap 29, rejoining in second position, while Schumacher still had to stop. Montoya pitted on the same lap as Räikkönen. On lap 31, Button suffered a right rear tyre de-lamination similar to Coulthard&#x27;s, at approximately , pitching him into a spin. As a result, he crashed into the Minardi of Baumgartner, who was being lapped, putting both drivers out of the race and bringing out a safety car. Schumacher, Pizzonia, and Heidfeld took the opportunity to pit behind the safety car.

Still behind the safety car, on lap 32, Pizzonia retired due to a gearbox problem. Räikkönen led the race from Schumacher, Montoya, Barrichello, and Zonta, who started last. At the restart on lap 34, Klien overtook Panis for eighth place and one point, as Coulthard overtook Trulli for tenth place. One lap later, Coulthard overtook Panis for ninth. On lap 36, Montoya&#x27;s rear right tyre de-laminated, forcing him to retire.

On lap 38, Coulthard attempted to overtake Klien for seventh place, but contact between the two drivers meant Coulthard needed a new front wing after it broke loose, with parts of it becoming stuck in the rear of the McLaren&#x27;s bodywork. The resulting debris caused the safety car to come out again. The safety car came in at the end of lap 41, but just four corners later, fourth-placed Zonta&#x27;s engine blew up spectacularly, putting him out of the race. On the penultimate lap, Coulthard overtook Panis for seventh.

Räikkönen won the race, his first and only victory of 2004. Schumacher finished second, with teammate Barrichello third. The result gave Schumacher his seventh and last World Drivers&#x27; Championship.

<text>The 2004 Italian Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Gran Premio Vodafone d&#x27;Italia 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 September 2004 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza. It was Race 15 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

== Report ==
=== Background ===
After the Belgian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher was already crowned driver world champion. He led the drivers&#x27; championship unassailably with 40 points ahead of Rubens Barrichello and 63 points ahead of Jenson Button. After the Hungarian Grand Prix, Ferrari was confirmed as constructors&#x27; world champion. They held an unassailable lead in the constructors&#x27; championship with 125 points ahead of Renault and 131 points ahead of BAR-Honda.

This race was Scuderia Ferrari&#x27;s 700th start in a World Championship event as a team. This was the last race for Giorgio Pantano.

=== Qualifying ===
In the first qualifying, in which the starting positions for the second qualifying were determined, Montoya achieved the fastest time. Barrichello was fastest in qualifying and secured pole position with a time of 1:20.089 minutes. Montoya came second ahead of Michael Schumacher.

In the first part of qualifying (which did not count towards grid positions), Montoya lapped Monza in his Williams FW26 at an average speed of , which at the time, was the fastest lap recorded at Monza, and the highest average speed over one lap in Formula One. These records would stand until the 2018 edition.

=== Race ===

The morning of the race was quite rainy and at the time of departure there were still wet parts of the circuit, which made tire selection difficult. At the beginning of the race, Alonso overtakes Barrichello; while Schumacher drops to 15th position after an incident. However, against all odds, Barrichello manages to regain third position after stopping on lap 5 to put on dry tires and Barrichello climbs back into first place.

In the Minardi pit garage, the car of Gianmaria Bruni caught fire after fuel escaped from the hose onto the hot bodywork during a routine pit-stop, and it was put out without any serious injury. Bruni inhaled some of the extinguishant and was having trouble breathing and so the team decided to retire the car.

Montoya&#x27;s teammate Antônio Pizzonia reached a top speed of , the fastest speed recorded in Formula One at the time (it was to be exceeded by Montoya at the 2005 edition).

Ferrari took a 1–2 in front of the delighted Tifosi, with Rubens Barrichello ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher.

<doc id="1123637" wikidata="Q190373" url="?curid=1123637" title="Joseph Barbera">
<text>Joseph Roland Barbera ( ; ; March 24, 1911 – December 18, 2006) was an American animator and cartoonist, best known as the co-founder of the animation studio Hanna-Barbera.

Born to Italian immigrants in New York City, Barbera joined Van Beuren Studios in 1927 and subsequently Terrytoons in 1936. In 1937, he moved to California, and while working at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Barbera met William Hanna. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;.

In 1957, after MGM dissolved its animation department, they co-founded Hanna-Barbera, which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot;, &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Huckleberry Hound&quot;, and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $12 million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company. In 1991, the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System, which merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.

Hanna and Barbera directed seven Academy Award films and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoon shows have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media, such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 28 languages.

==Early and personal life==
Joseph Barbera was born at 10 Delancey Street in the Little Italy, Lower East Side section of Manhattan, New York, to Italian Sicilian immigrants Vincenzo Barbera (1884–1969), born in Castelvetrano and Francesca Calvacca (1892–1974), born in Sciacca. Joseph Barbara&#x27;s grandmother, also named Francesca, was born in Sciacca as well, as stated in his autobiography, &quot;My life in &#x27;toons,&quot; in which he also described himself as Sicilian. He grew up speaking Italian, He had two brothers, Larry (1909–1982) and Ted (1919–1994), both of whom served in World War II. As a member of the United States Army, Larry participated in the invasion of Sicily. Ted was a fighter pilot with the United States Army Air Forces and served in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. Barbera&#x27;s father, Vincent, was the prosperous owner of three barbershops who squandered the family fortunes on gambling. By the time Barbera was 15, his father had abandoned the family, and his maternal uncle Jim had become a father figure to him.

Barbera displayed a talent for drawing as early as the first grade. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1928. While in high school, Barbera won several boxing titles. He was briefly managed by World Lightweight Boxing Champion Al Singer&#x27;s manager but soon lost interest in boxing. In 1935, Barbera married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Earl. In school, they had been known as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Barbera and his wife briefly separated when he went to California. They reunited but were on the verge of another separation when they discovered that Dorothy was pregnant with their first child. They had four children: two sons, Neal and an infant boy who died two days after his birth, and two daughters, Lynn and Jayne, who has been a producer in her own right. The marriage officially ended in 1963. Shortly after his divorce, Barbera met his second wife, Sheila Holden, sister of British rock and roll singer Vince Taylor, at Musso &amp; Frank&#x27;s restaurant, where she worked as bookkeeper and cashier. Unlike Dorothy, who preferred to stay at home with the children, Sheila enjoyed the Hollywood social scene that Barbera often frequented.

==Career==

===Early career===
During high school, Barbera worked as a tailor&#x27;s delivery boy. In 1929, he became interested in animation after watching a screening of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot;. During the Great Depression, he tried unsuccessfully to become a cartoonist for &quot;The NY Hits Magazine&quot;. He supported himself with a job at a bank and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never occurred.

Barbera took art classes at the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired to work in the ink and paint department of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist. He worked on cartoon series such as &quot;Cubby Bear&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Parades&quot; and an earlier &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. This &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera&#x27;s later cat-and-mouse series, although both of these cartoons adopted the name created in &quot;Life in London&quot;, a 1821 British novel written by Pierce Egan. When Van Beuren closed in 1936, Barbera moved to Paul Terry&#x27;s Terrytoons studio.

In 1935, Barbera created his first solo-effort storyboard about a character named &quot;Kiko the Kangaroo&quot;. The storyline was of Kiko in an airplane race with another character called &quot;Dirty Dog&quot;. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts ...&quot;I was, quite honestly, not in the least disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough.&quot;The original storyboard, passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.

===Film===
Lured by a substantial salary increase, Barbera left Terrytoons and New York for the new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio in California in 1937. He found that Los Angeles suffered just as much from the Great Depression as Brooklyn and almost returned to Brooklyn.

Barbera&#x27;s desk was opposite that of William Hanna. The two quickly realized they would make a good team. By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and co-created Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed &quot;Droopy&quot; cartoons at MGM.

In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly directed &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, Barbera and Hanna&#x27;s supervisor, Fred Quimby, did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons, believing that those were already enough. Surprised by the success of &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby&#x27;s resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme.

By this time, Hanna wanted to return to working for Rudolf Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, he never worked on it. Quimby, who wanted to start a new animation unit independent from Ising, then permitted Hanna and Barbera to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;.

Modeled after the &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot; characters with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they settled on this cartoon&#x27;s cat and mouse theme because &quot;we knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, chase, and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought.&quot; The revamped characters first appeared in 1941&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Snack&quot;. Over the next 17 years, Barbera and Hanna worked exclusively on &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts. During World War II, they also made animated training films.

&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. Despite its popularity, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; have often been criticized as excessively violent. The series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, &quot;The Yankee Doodle Mouse&quot; (1943)—a war-time adventure. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; was nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7, more than any other animated series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM&#x27;s live-action films, including &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945) and, &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; (1956) with Gene Kelly, and &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot; (1953) with Esther Williams.

In addition to his work in animated cartoons, Barbera and &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; layout artist Harvey Eisenberg moonlit to run a comic book company named Dearfield Publishing. Active from 1946 to 1951, Dearfield&#x27;s titles included &quot;&quot;Red&quot; Rabbit Comics&quot;, &quot;Foxy Fagan&quot;, and &quot;Junie Prom&quot;.

Quimby accepted each Academy Award for &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; without inviting Barbera and Hanna onstage. The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer, following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising. Quimby once delayed a promised raise to Barbera by six months. When Quimby retired in late 1955, Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM&#x27;s animation division. As MGM began to lose more revenue on animated cartoons due to television, the studio soon realized that re-releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones. In 1957, MGM ordered Barbera and Hanna&#x27;s business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone phone. Barbera and Hanna found the no-notice closing puzzling because &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; had succeeded.

===Television===

In 1957, Barbera reteamed with his former partner Hanna to produce cartoon films for television and theatrical release. The two brought their different skills to the company as they had at MGM. Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year, the title of president alternated between them. A coin toss gave Hanna precedence in the naming of the new company first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna-Barbera Productions. Barbera and Hanna&#x27;s MGM colleague George Sidney, the director of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, became the third partner and business manager in the company and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with Screen Gems, the television division of Columbia Pictures, who took part ownership of the new studio.

The first offering from the new company was &quot;The Ruff &amp; Reddy Show&quot;, a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and a cat. Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture, &quot;Loopy De Loop&quot;, Hanna-Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series: &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; and &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;. A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of &quot;Huckleberry Hound&quot; were adults. This prompted the company to create a new animated series, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. A parody of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, the new show followed a typical Stone Age family with home appliances, talking animals, and celebrity guests. With an audience of both children and adults, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; became the first animated prime-time show to be a hit. Fred Flintstone&#x27;s signature exclamation, &quot;yabba dabba doo,&quot; soon entered everyday usage, and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field. The company later produced a futuristic version of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, known as &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; was far more popular.

By the late 1960s, Hanna-Barbera Productions was the business&#x27;s most successful television animation studio. The Hanna-Barbera studio produced over 3000 animated half-hour television shows. Among the more than 100 cartoon series they produced were &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot;, &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;The Magilla Gorilla Show&quot;, &quot;The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;Super Friends&quot;, and &quot;The Smurfs&quot;. The company also produced animated specials based on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, and feature-length films &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; and &quot;Heidi&#x27;s Song&quot;.

As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna-Barbera was key in developing of an animation technique known as limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective but often reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation.

The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Critics criticized the change from detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that they chose to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna-Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation paved the way for future animated series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, and &quot;South Park&quot;.

In December 1966, Hanna-Barbera Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting, renamed Great American Communications in 1987, for $12 million. Barbera and Hanna remained at the head of the company until 1991. The company was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated $320 million. Turner began using Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s television catalog as material for its new Cartoon Network cable channel in 1992, and by the mid-1990s, Hanna-Barbera was producing several original series for Cartoon Network, among them &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. In 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner, owners of Warner Bros., who would eventually absorb Hanna-Barbera into Warner Bros. Animation.

Barbera and Hanna continued to advise their former company. They periodically worked on new Hanna-Barbera shows, including shorts for the series &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; and feature film versions of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994) and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002). In a new &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon produced in 2000, &quot;The Mansion Cat&quot;, Barbera voiced the house owner.

Ten days before Hanna&#x27;s death from throat cancer in March 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation, with the unit dedicated to the Cartoon Network original series spun off into Cartoon Network Studios. Barbera remained active as an executive producer for Warner Bros. on direct-to-video cartoon features and television series such as &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot;. He also wrote, co-storyboarded, co-directed, and co-produced &quot;The Karate Guard&quot; (2005), the return of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; to the big screen. His final animated project was the direct-to-video feature &quot;Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale&quot; (2007).

==Death==
On December 18, 2006, Barbera died of natural causes at his home in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, at 95, ending a seventy-year career in animation. His wife Sheila was at his side at the end; he was also survived by three children from his first marriage: Jayne (who worked for Hanna-Barbera), Lynn, and Neal. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
Most of the cartoons Barbera and Hanna created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Fred and Barney, Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble, Dick Dastardly and Muttley, Tom and Jerry, Scooby and Shaggy, Ruff and Reddy, Jake Clawson/Razor and Chance Furlong/T-Bone, The Jetson family and Yogi &amp; Boo-Boo. These may have reflected the close business friendship and partnership that Barbera and Hanna shared for over 60 years. Professionally, they balanced each other&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses very well, but Barbera and Hanna traveled in entirely different social circles. Hanna&#x27;s circle of personal friends primarily included other animators. Barbera socialized with Hollywood celebrities—Zsa Zsa Gabor was a frequent visitor to his house.

Their division of work roles complemented each other, but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink. In their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2,000 animated characters, Barbera and Hanna rarely exchanged a cross word. Barbera said: &quot;We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had a deep respect for the other&#x27;s work.&quot; Hanna once told that Barbera could &quot;capture mood and expression in a quick sketch better than anyone I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;

Barbera and Hanna were also among the first animators to realize the enormous potential of television. Leonard Maltin says the Hanna–Barbera team &quot;held a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year—without a break or change in routine. Their characters are not only animated superstars, but also a very beloved part of American pop culture&quot;. They are often considered Walt Disney&#x27;s only rivals in cartoon animation.

Barbera and Hanna had a lasting impact on television animation. Cartoons they created often make the &quot;greatest&quot; lists. Many of their characters have appeared in films, books, toys, and other media. Their shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in the 1960s and have been translated into more than 20 languages. The works of Barbera and Hanna have been praised not only for their animation but for their music. &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot; (1946) and &quot;Johann Mouse&quot; (1952) have both been called &quot;masterpieces of animation&quot; largely because of their classical music.

The Hanna–Barbera team won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards, including the 1960 award for &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot;, which was the first Emmy awarded to an animated series. They also won these awards: Golden Globe for Television Achievement (1960), Golden IKE Award – Pacific Pioneers in Broadcasting (1983), Pioneer Award – Broadcast Music Incorporated (1987), Iris Award – NATPE Men of the Year (1988), Licensing Industry Merchandisers&#x27; Association award for Lifetime Achievement (1988), Governors Award of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (1988), Jackie Coogan Award for Outstanding Contribution to Youth through Entertainment Youth in Film (1988), Frederic W. Ziv Award for Outstanding Achievement in Telecommunications – Broadcasting Division College – Conservatory of Music University of Cincinnati (1989), stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1976), several Annie Awards, several environmental awards, and were recipients of numerous other accolades before their induction into the Television Hall of Fame in 1994. In March 2005, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences and Warner Bros. Animation dedicated a wall sculpture at the Television Academy&#x27;s Hall of Fame Plaza in North Hollywood to Hanna and Barbera.

In 1992, Barbera met with pop musician Michael Jackson, an avid cartoon fan, in an unsuccessful attempt to arrange for Jackson to sing in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;. Barbera drew five quick sketches of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; for Jackson and autographed them. Jackson autographed a picture of himself and his niece Nicole for Barbera with the words: &quot;To my hero of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, with many thanks for all the many cartoon friends you gave me as a child. They were all I had. – Michael&quot;

<text>The Turnbull River is a short river on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It flows northwest from the Southern Alps for , entering the Tasman Sea at the northern end of Jackson Bay, south of Haast. The Turnbull shares its mouth with the Okuru River.

The Haast area is not connected to the national electricity grid. New Zealand Energy operates an electricity distribution network supplying the town. Electricity is generated by an 800-kilowatt hydroelectric scheme on the Turnbull River, constructed in 1972. The scheme is backed up by a 375-kilowatt diesel generator. In 2023, the company applied for consent to build a second hydro power station on the Turnbull River.

<doc id="1123645" wikidata="Q201682" url="?curid=1123645" title="Mātakitaki River">
<text>The Mātakitaki River is located in the north of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. An upper tributary of the Buller River, it flows north and west for 65 kilometres from its source north of the Lewis Pass, joining the Buller at Murchison. It has one major tributary, the Glenroy River.

==Whitewater recreation==

The river has two excellent whitewater sections on it, and they are frequently paddled.
The &quot;Middle Mātakitaki&quot; section is about 10 km up the valley from Murchison, and is Grade/Class 2+, with some excellent play spots.
The &quot;Lower Mātakitaki&quot; section is a short distance up the river from Murchison, and is a short technical run pushing Grade/Class 3+ at medium flows, Grade/Class 4 at higher flows.

The Mātakitaki River and tributaries are known for gold mining, both historically and today. Alluvial gold is regarded as having a high purity and is often found in the coarse form. Many river flats are subject to mining, including two dredging operations situated within the riverbed within the &quot;Lower&quot; and &quot;Middle&quot; sections.

==Trout fishing==
It is an extremely important fishery and highly regarded not only for the numbers caught, but also as a trophy river.

==Hydroelectric power==
Network Tasman have proposed a 30 MW hydroelectric power station for the river. Whitewater NZ say it will interfere with the popular Middle Mātakitaki whitewater run. Network Tasman announced that plans to investigate the river for hydro development are on hold due to economic conditions.

The arrondissement of Lens was created in 1962 from part of the arrondissement of Béthune. In January 2007 it absorbed the two cantons of Avion and Rouvroy from the arrondissement of Arras. At the January 2017 reorganisation of the arrondissements of Pas-de-Calais, it gained eight communes from the arrondissement of Arras, and it lost one commune to the arrondissement of Béthune.

As a result of the reorganisation of the cantons of France which came into effect in 2015, the borders of the cantons are no longer related to the borders of the arrondissements. The cantons of the arrondissement of Lens were, as of January 2015:

# Avion

<text>The Ōhikanui River is a tributary of the Buller River in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It flows north for , joining the Buller from its outflow into the Tasman Sea. It and its smaller neighbour the &quot;Ōhikaiti River&quot; are often called the Big Ohika River and Little Ohika River respectively. Another variation is Ohika-nui. Ōhikanui River has been the official name since 21 June 2019.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;place of large incantations&quot; for &quot;Ōhikanui&quot;.

A surveyor named the tributaries to the west of the Ōhikanui River using Greek letters, as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Eta Creeks. He also named Dumpling Creek after he returned to camp on a cold wet day and was given a dumpling stew.

The Ōhikanui River is a tributary consisting of a bouldery river bed and clear swift water. It flows through the paparoa wilderness area which is unaltered (with no tracks or huts), though Buckland Peak Hut is just outside the catchment. The area is popular with trampers because of its natural environment, with Brown trout fishers, who use the river about 140 times a year, and with deer stalkers.

Most of the valley runs over a Late Devonian pluton of leucocratic muscovite granite. The mountains at the southern end of the valley, made of early Paleozoic Pecksniff metasedimentary gneiss, have been carved by glaciation to form cirques and sharp ridges. The valley has high glacial aggradation, and lower degradation, terraces.

There were never any sawmills in the valley. Forest covers the whole valley, with no grassy flats. Tall forest is replaced by stunted forest, merging to alpine scrub, at to , depending on aspect, landform and cold air drainage. The valley has an average of over of rain, more than 200 wet days a year and rainfall has been measured at over per hour. In the 1970s red deer, goats and rats were scarce, possums in moderate numbers and stoats everywhere. The valley now has pest control as part of the Paparoa Range TB Management Area.

The lower valley has cabbage tree, northern rātā, rimu, kahikatea, kamahi, kanono, karamu, kareao, kiekie, kōwhai, māhoe, mataī, porokaiwhiri, toro, tutu, yellow silver pine, mountain toatoa and mountain beech. The middle valley has horopito, silver beech, tawhai raunui, mountain tōtara and rimu, with crown fern and bush rice grass (Microlaena avenacea) in the understorey. Silver and mountain beech dominate the upper slopes, with Archeria traversii and mountain neinei. Birds in the valley in the 1970s included blackbird, chaffinch, dunnock, greenfinch, goldfinch, kākāriki, karoro, kāhu, kākā, kakaruwai, kārearea, kawau, kawaupaka, kea, kererū, koekoeā, korimako, kōtare, kōtātā, ngirungiru, pihoihoi, pipipi, pīpīwharauroa, pīwakawaka, redpoll, riroriro, roroa, ruru, silvereye, skylark, song thrush, titipounamu, tūī, weka and whio.

A truss bridge over the Ōhikanui was finished in September 1879, though the approaches, which required rock-cutting, took until March 1880. Its spans were 3 x and 1 x . It was built to cope with floods rising to , but floods in 1925, 1967, 1970 and 1971 covered the bridge. The bridge was raised and rebuilt as a timber truss on concrete piers in 1927, though in later years it could only take light traffic and had to be supplemented by a bailey bridge. SH6 now crosses the river near its mouth on a concrete bridge built in 1992.

In 1962 the National government agreed in principle to building a 13.6MW hydro-electric power station, with a head, after Labour had refused in 1960. Since July 2001 the Buller Water Conservation Order has protected the river from development.

<text>Kirby Muxloe Castle, also known historically as Kirby Castle, is a ruined, fortified manor house in Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire, England. William, Lord Hastings, began work on the castle in 1480, founding it on the site of a pre-existing manor house. William was a favourite of King Edward IV and had prospered considerably during the Wars of the Roses. Work continued quickly until 1483, when William was executed during Richard, Duke of Gloucester&#x27;s, seizure of the throne. His widow briefly continued the project after his death but efforts then ceased, with the castle remaining largely incomplete. Parts of the castle were inhabited for a period, before falling into ruin during the course of the 17th century. In 1912, the Commissioners of Work took over management of the site, repairing the brickwork and carrying out an archaeological survey. In the 21st century, the castle is controlled by English Heritage and open to visitors.

The castle was rectangular in design, across, and would have comprised four corner towers, three side towers and a large gatehouse, all protected by a water-filled moat; the centre of the castle would have formed a courtyard. Of these buildings, only the gatehouse and the west tower survive today, partially intact. They are constructed with decorative brickwork and stone detailing, in a fashionable late 15th-century style, and have various symbols built into their walls using darker bricks. Twelve gunports for early gunpowder artillery were built into the walls of these two buildings, although historians are uncertain whether these defences were intended to be practical or symbolic. The government body Historic England considers the castle to be a &quot;spectacular example of a late medieval quadrangular castle of the highest status&quot;.

==History==
===15th–17th centuries===

Kirby Muxloe Castle was built by William, Lord Hastings, the chamberlain of the royal household and a favourite of Edward IV. William had acquired extensive estates across the Midlands during the Wars of the Roses, much of it confiscated from his enemies. William&#x27;s father, Sir Leonard, had maintained his seat at Kirby Muxloe, but William moved his own seat to the manor of Ashby de la Zouch in 1462. In 1474, Edward granted William the right to crenellate, or fortify, four of his manors and to build deer parks around them. Among these was Kirby Muxloe, which the King authorised to be turned into a castle and surrounded by a large park of .
Work began on Kirby Muxloe Castle in October 1480, under the direction of Roger Bowlott, who was Lord Hasting&#x27;s steward and became the clerk of works for the project. Most of the existing manor house was protected during the work, and probably continued in use while the new castle was built around it. A workshop able to make up to 100,000 bricks a week was constructed by Antony Yzebrond from Flanders. A brook was redirected to feed the new moat and a garden was established alongside the castle. Work intensified in early 1481, with the stonework being supervised by John Cowper, a master mason. The work progressed at speed and, at peak periods, over 40 men were working on the site. It is uncertain exactly how much of the castle was constructed, although at least one corner tower had been nearly completed by 1483 and the ground floor of the gatehouse laid down.

Edward IV died in 1483, leaving the kingdom to his young son, Edward V, but his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had his own ambitions for the throne. Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the deposition of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, ahead of his own coronation. Kirby Muxloe and Lord Hasting&#x27;s other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine. After a short pause, Katherine continued some work on the site until the summer of 1484, focusing on making the corner tower and partially finished gatehouse habitable, before the project was finally halted. By this point around £1,000 had been spent on the works, including the laying of 1.3 million bricks.

At least initially, some parts of the castle were occupied, possibly including the remains of the original manor house. The castle continued to be owned by the Hastings family until around 1630, when it was purchased by Sir Robert Banaster, and then by William Wollaston. Over the course of the rest of the century, Kirby Muxloe Castle was abandoned; it was robbed for its building materials, and became used for agricultural purposes.

===18th–21st centuries===

The castle was purchased from the Wollaston family in 1788 by Clement Winstanley. In 1790, the remains of the north tower were still standing, albeit in very poor condition. Clement Winstanley reportedly wanted to pull the northern ruins down, intending to reuse the bricks to make a barn, but his son, also called Clement, intervened, and subsequently carried out repairs to the castle. By the 19th century the ruins were covered in ivy; by the early 20th century, trees were growing out of the tops of the walls, which were frequented by grazing goats and cattle. Much of the moat had silted up and the remains of the bridge had been buried by the accumulated debris.

By 1911, the owner Major Richard Winstanley was unable to pay for the upkeep of the castle and, concerned about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.

There had been hopes of finding additional remains during Peers&#x27; archaeological investigations but, although the foundations of the original manor house were uncovered, few other items were discovered. The complete financial records of the castle&#x27;s construction, however, were found in the archives of the Hastings family by the historian Thomas Fosbrooke while he was investigating Ashby by de la Zouch castle, who passed them to Peers; they have since provided what the historian John Goodall describes as &quot;a fascinating insight&quot; into medieval building operations.

In the 21st century, Kirby Muxloe Castle is managed by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 2,461 visitors in 2015. Substantial restoration work was carried out in 2006, including extensive replacement of much of the brickwork. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, and Historic England considers it to be a &quot;spectacular example of a late medieval quadrangular castle of the highest status&quot;. According to a 2013 report by English Heritage, almost the entire Kirby Muxloe Castle estate was at high risk of flooding.

==Architecture==
===Location===
Kirby Muxloe Castle is positioned set back from the village of Kirby Muxloe on low-lying land; the castle&#x27;s gardens and orchard probably stood to the north and west of the current site. John Goodall suggests that the earlier residence on the site was built around two courts, one of which survives within the later castle, with the other on the north-west side of the site. The historian Anthony Emery, however, argues that the earlier manor was similar in size and shape to the current castle: he suggests that it was fortified and was protected by a moat similar to that seen today. The foundations of the first residence discovered between 1912 and 1913 were left uncovered after the excavations and remain visible in the castle lawns.

===Design===

The 15th-century castle is rectangular in shape, across, similar in design to Farleigh Hungerford Castle in Somerset or Baconsthorpe Castle in Norfolk. Although incomplete, the surviving elements and the foundations show that it was designed with a square tower on each corner, with less substantial side towers on the north-east, south-east and south-west edges, and a large gatehouse on the north-western side. An inner range of buildings, deep, ran around the inside of the curtain wall, set back slightly from the wall itself and forming a central courtyard. The towers projected into the water-filled moat which surrounded the castle.

The moat was supplied with water from a small brook, which also fed a suite of stew ponds for the castle. Two dams were constructed to create the moat, the first to divert water from the main stream, and the second to control the water level in the moat. The current sluices are modern, but the originals were made from wood and leather. The moat, between and wide, was crossed by an oak bridge.

Only the gatehouse and the west tower still survive, partially intact. The gatehouse was originally protected by a drawbridge and a portcullis. The gatehouse was rectangular, built from brick with stone detailing, with four polygonal turrets. Had it been completed, it might have been tall and have resembled the gatehouse at Layer Marney Tower. On the ground floor, two chambers, including the porter&#x27;s lodge, flanked the gate passage. The first floor housed the portcullis mechanism and a garderobe. If the second floor was ever completed, it has since been lost. The west tower is across externally and internally, made of simple patterned brickwork, with three floors and two, slightly taller, turrets on the inside corners. Each floor had a single chamber, with a fireplace and an adjacent garderobe, which would have formed lodgings for senior members of the household.

The castle was primarily built from bricks, with stone used for the detailing, such as doorways. The brickwork was decorated with patterns of darker bricks, called diapering, which was used to show symbols associated with Lord Hastings, as well as objects such as a jug and a ship. This style of decorative brickwork and stonework was popular across England at this time, but particularly so at Eton College, where John Cowper, the master mason on the project, had been an apprentice. Although the castle was not extensively decorated, the brickwork at Kirby Muxloe was skillfully executed, with the bricklayers cutting and shaping the kiln-fired bricks to produce spiral and domed vaulting.

Gunports for early gunpowder artillery had begun to be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the draughts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design and may have been intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle&#x27;s defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.

<text>The Stony Point line is a commuter railway line in the outer metropolitan area of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s only diesel service on the metropolitan network and the tenth longest line at . The line acts as an extension of the Frankston line with services running from Frankston station to the small town of Stony Point in the south-east, serving 10 stations via Leawarra, Baxter, Hastings, and Bittern. The line operates for approximately 13 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around 10:30 pm), unlike other lines on the network, which provide 24-hour service on Friday and Saturday nights. Headways of 90 to 120 minutes are operated throughout the day due to limited patronage and infrastructure constraints. Trains on the Stony Point line run as two one-car formations of V/Line Sprinter DMUs. 

Sections of the Stony Point line opened as early as 1888, with the line fully extended to Stony Point in 1889. Only two stations have opened since its extension in the 1880s—Leawarra and Morradoo. The line was built to connect Melbourne and Frankston with the rural towns of Baxter, Hastings, and Bittern, amongst others. The line also facilitates freight services to the Port of Hastings. Significant growth has occurred since the line&#x27;s opening, with a plan to extend the Frankston line along part of the Stony Point line to Baxter.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The Stony Point line initially operated from Frankston to Baxter station, with services commencing in 1888. Extensions to Hastings, Bittern, and Stony Point were completed the following year in 1889. Branch lines were opened from Baxter to Mornington in 1889 and from Bittern to Red Hill in 1921.

=== 20th century ===
A new station was opened at Leawarra in 1906 and Morradoo in 1960.

The Red Hill line was closed in 1953 with the Mornington line remaining open until 1981. A long branch from Long Island Junction to Long Island was opened on 29 April 1969 to serve the adjacent steel mill. Passenger services on the entire line were withdrawn on 10 June 1981, and the line from Long Island Junction to Stony Point was closed on 22 June 1981. Services then recommenced on 26 September 1984. Upon reopening, DRC railcars were used, with two MTH carriages present in between them making up a 4 car train. Frequent breakdowns saw diesel locomotives called in to haul the consist instead.

In August 1994, a T class locomotive with two MTH carriages was used, but by November 1995, weekday services were being operated by a P class with 2 MTH carriages, with an A class used on weekends with an extra MTH car. On another occasion in November 1995, an X class diesel locomotive in the V/Line Freight livery was used with three MTH carriages. These configurations were not used after V/Line was separated into passenger and freight divisions.

=== 21st century ===

Few changes occurred in the 2000s as the service settled down after a period of frequent changes to the operators, services, and rolling-stock. On a limited number of occasions, train operator V/Line underwent locomotive shortages, with additional trains leased from Freight Australia and later Pacific National appearing on the lines in their green and yellow livery. In 2008, the Stony Point line underwent major re-signalling works including the introduction of three position signalling for the first time on the line. The new signalling system was now controlled remotely by the Frankston Signal Box.

In April 2008, Sprinter units were introduced on the line, originally purchased by V/Line in 1993. Two units usually operate the service, with a single unit returning to Southern Cross for servicing on a regular basis, and another sent in the opposite direction to replace it. The units are selected from the normal V/Line fleet, and are not dedicated to operate the Stony Point service. 

Malfunctions related to boom gates forced the line&#x27;s closure for three months in 2015.

== Future ==

=== Baxter extension ===

In 2013, as part of Public Transport Victoria&#x27;s Network Development Plan for metropolitan rail, an extension of the Frankston line to Baxter was earmarked to begin in the &quot;long-term&quot; (over the next 20 years). During the 2018 state election, the Liberal Party announced a project to extend electrified services to Baxter. The project would have included the removal of all crossings between Frankston and Baxter, duplication and electrification works, the construction of one (or two) new stations, and the reconstruction of stations along the corridor. The Federal Liberals announced $450 million of joint funding for the project promised between the state and federal governments, with the national government promising to provide $225 million of the funding. The incumbent Andrews Labor government argued that the project was not needed, instead prioritising funding to other projects across the state.

A business case commissioned by the government was completed in 2019 with no further progress being made.

Again in the lead up to the 2022 state election, the Liberal opposition supported the electrification to Baxter. The second Andrews government made no commitments to the Baxter rail extension, instead continuing construction on level crossing removal works along the Frankston line. The 2022 state election resulted in another Labor victory, with the Andrews government pushing ahead with these works.

In November 2023, a review commissioned into infrastructure investment found that the Baxter rail extension did not meet the &quot;investment priorities&quot; of the Albanese government and would lose its $225 million in federal funding.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Stony Point line operate from approximately 5:30 am to 10:30 pm Monday to Friday, and 7:00 am to 8:30 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Train frequency is typically every 90 to 120 minutes throughout the day due to the line being single track with no passing loops. Regular services do not run past Frankston; stations between Frankston and Stony Point are instead serviced by shuttle. Unlike the rest of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, services do not run 24 hours a day on Friday nights and weekends.

Freight operations typically occur twice daily, with Qube Holdings operating services to the Long Island steel mills and the Port of Hastings. Trains to Melbourne run at approximately 4:00 am and during the mid-afternoon, while trains from Melbourne run at approximately midnight and noon.

Train services on the Stony Point line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

=== Operators ===
The Stony Point line has had numerous operators since its opening in 1889. Government operators Victorian Railways, the State Transport Authority, the Public Transport Corporation and V/Line operated the line from 1889 till the privatisation of the Melbourne rail network in 1998. On 1 July 1998, operation of the Stony Point line was transferred from V/Line. V/Line was privatised in 1999 and later returned to full government ownership in 2003. It has since continued to operate the service on behalf of three different Melbourne private rail operators: M&gt;Train, Connex, and Metro Trains.
=== Route ===

The Stony Point line forms a somewhat linear route from the Frankston station to its terminus in the small town of Stony Point. The route is long and is predominantly single tracked, with double tracked sections only present at the end stations on the line. After changing from the Frankston line at Frankston station, the Stony Point line traverses mainly flat country with few curves and fairly minimal earthworks for most of the line.

After Frankston, most of the rail line goes through smaller suburbs and some industrial areas, with large sections of the line passing through more open countryside, passing by open fields and farms.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 10 stations across of track. All stations are at ground level. 

== Infrastructure ==

=== Rolling stock ===

The Stony Point line uses V/Line Sprinter diesel multiple unit (DMU) trains operating in a one or two-car configuration, with two doors per side on each carriage and accommodating up to 90 passengers in each car. The trains are shared with other V/Line regional train routes, and subsequently receive refuelling and servicing near Southern Cross station. The trains were originally built between 1993 and 1995 with a total of 22 constructed.

Alongside the passenger trains, Stony Point line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The three types of engineering trains are the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

=== Accessibility ===
In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with accessibility guidelines. All stations on the corridor are fully accessible—a first in Melbourne. The stations feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

=== Signalling ===
The Stony Point line uses three position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was fully introduced on the corridor in March 2008.

<doc id="1123698" wikidata="Q5375776" url="?curid=1123698" title="End-to-end delay">
<text>End-to-end delay or one-way delay (OWD) refers to the time taken for a packet to be transmitted across a network from source to destination. It is a common term in IP network monitoring, and differs from round-trip time (RTT) in that only path in the one direction from source to destination is measured.

==Measurement==
The ping utility measures the RTT, that is, the time to go and come back to a host. Half the RTT is often used as an approximation of OWD but this assumes that the forward and back paths are the same in terms of congestion, number of hops, or quality of service (QoS). This is not always a good assumption. To avoid such problems, the OWD may be measured directly.

===Direct===
OWDs may be measured between two points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of an IP network through the use of synchronized clocks; &quot;A&quot; records a timestamp on the packet and sends it to &quot;B&quot;, which notes the receiving time and calculates the OWD as their difference. The transmitted packets need to be identified at source and destination in order to avoid packet loss or packet reordering. However, this method suffers several limitations, such as requiring intensive cooperation between both parties, and the accuracy of the measured delay is subject to the synchronization precision.

The Minimum-Pairs Protocol is an example by which several cooperating entities, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;, could measure OWDs between one of them and a fourth less cooperative one (e.g., between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;X&quot;).

===Estimate===
Transmission between two network nodes may be asymmetric, and the forward and reverse delays are not equal. Half the RTT value is the average of the forward and reverse delays and so may be sometimes used as an approximation to the end-to-end delay. The accuracy of such an estimate depends on the nature of delay distribution in both directions. As delays in both directions become more symmetric, the accuracy increases.

The probability mass function (PMF) of absolute error, &quot;E&quot;, between the smaller of the forward and reverse OWDs and their average (i.e., RTT/2) can be expressed as a function of the network delay distribution as follows:

formula_1

where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the forward and reverse edges, and &quot;fy&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is the PMF of delay of edge &quot;z&quot; (that is, 

==Delay components==
End-to-end delay in networks comes from several sources including transmission delay, propagation delay, processing delay and queuing delay.

<doc id="1123699" wikidata="Q2275017" url="?curid=1123699" title="USS Besugo">
<text>USS &quot;Besugo&quot; (SS-321, later AGSS-321), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy in commission from 1944 to 1958. She was named for the besugo.

During World War II, &quot;Besugo&quot; made five war patrols between 26 September 1944 and 25 July 1945, operating in the Bungo Channel, Makassar Strait, Java Sea, and South China Sea. During these patrols, &quot;Besugo&quot; sank the German submarine , becoming one of a very few U.S. submarines to sink a German naval vessel during the war. She also sank the 10,020-gross register ton tanker &quot;Nichei Maru&quot;, one landing ship, one frigate, and a minesweeper.

After post-World War II Korean War and Cold War U.S. Navy service, &quot;Besugo&quot; was decommissioned. She was loaned to the Italian Navy in 1966, in which she served until 1973 as &quot;Francesco Morosini&quot; (S 508).

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Besugo&quot;′s keel was laid down on 27 May 1943 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company. She was launched on 27 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Perry Homer, an employee in the Outside Machinist&#x27;s Department of the Electric Boat Company and wife of Peter J. Homer, also an employee of the company. &quot;Besugo&quot; was commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton on 19 June 1944 with Commander Thomas L. Wogan in command.

==Service history==
===United States Navy===
====World War II====
=====June–September 1944=====
&quot;Besugo&quot; completed shakedown training in the waters off New London, Connecticut, before heading south on 25 July 1944. Arriving at Key West, Florida, on 1 August 1944, she conducted another two weeks of training with the Key West Sound School before setting out for the Pacific Ocean on 13 August. She transited the Panama Canal on 17 August and, after five days of repairs at Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone, continued on to Pearl Harbor in the Territory of Hawaii, arriving there on 7 September 1944. She spent the next two weeks training in the waters of the Hawaiian Islands.

=====First war patrol=====

&quot;Besugo&quot; put to sea from Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol on 26 September 1944, escorted until dark by the submarine chaser . In company with the submarine , &quot;Besugo&quot; headed west and stopped at Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to refuel on 30 September. Departing Midway the same day, the two submarines rendezvoused with the submarine before heading northwest to the Bungo Channel entrance to Japan&#x27;s Seto Inland Sea.

While en route on 6 October 1944, the submarines spotted a picket boat — a small Japanese patrol boat — lying to northwest of Marcus Island. As &quot;Besugo&quot; closed to destroy the patrol boat, &quot;Gabilan&quot; and &quot;Ronquil&quot; continued on course. At 21:02, &quot;Besugo&quot; fired three torpedoes at the target. All missed, probably because of the shallow draft of the patrol boat. After waiting for night to fall, &quot;Besugo&quot; circled the target, surfaced, and closed for a gun attack at 22:28. Although the combination of light swells and insufficient moonlight made gunfire ineffective, the two 20-millimeter guns scored some hits. The Japanese patrol boat responded with sporadic bursts of light machine-gun fire. Just as the patrol boat closed the range, both of &quot;Besugo&quot;′s 20-millimeter guns jammed. The Japanese picket boat then opened fire with a heavy machine gun. Bullets began striking the water around &quot;Besugo&quot;, and several struck her conning tower and periscope shears. Splinters from these hits wounded the gunnery officer and a lookout. Unable to return fire effectively, &quot;Besugo&quot; withdrew, leading her commanding officer to remark, &quot;Not an auspicious beginning to our fighting career.&quot;

On 8 October 1944, &quot;Besugo&quot; spotted an Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi G4M Type 1 bomber (Allied reporting name &quot;Betty&quot;) and submerged for the remainder of the day. On the morning of 9 October, a patrolling Japanese armed trawler forced her to submerge, further delaying her progress. Then, at 03:29 on 10 October, her radar indicated a Japanese patrol plane was pursuing her. As put by her war diarist, it took half an hour of &quot;nerve-wracking&quot; maneuvering to shake off the Japanese plane.

At dawn on 10 October 1944, &quot;Besugo&quot; reached her patrol station and began a submerged daylight patrol in the eastern approaches to the Bungo Channel. Owing to the upcoming U.S. landings on Leyte in the Philippine Islands, scheduled for 20 October, &quot;Besugo&quot; had orders to spot any Japanese heavy fleet units departing the Bungo Channel and to refrain from firing at any targets until after sending in a contact report. On the morning of 15 October 1944, she watched as five Japanese cruisers and a destroyer steamed by her position before she radioed in a contact report that evening.

On the evening of 16 October 1944, &quot;Besugo&quot;′s radar picked up two targets transiting the Bungo Channel. Believing they were heavy cruisers, &quot;Besugo&quot; maneuvered into firing position and loosed six bow torpedoes at the nearest target. Two minutes later, at 22:12, one torpedo hit one of the Japanese warships just abaft the bridge. The Japanese ships &quot;milled about,&quot; according to &quot;Besugo&quot;′s war diary, for a few minutes, during which time &quot;Besugo&quot; retired to reload, but the Japanese quickly skirted the coast of Kyushu and turned for home. &quot;Besugo&quot; tracked them for almost two hours but was unable to close for another attack. A postwar review of records indicated that the damaged ship actually was the destroyer .

On 18 October 1944, &quot;Besugo&quot; spotted two more warships, this time entering the Bungo Channel rather than leaving it, and noted the contacts in accordance with her orders. Although Japanese air patrols increased noticeably over the next few days, including one radar-equipped search plane that kept &quot;Besugo&quot; pinned down on 22 October, &quot;Besugo&quot; and &quot;Ronquil&quot; did manage to find a Japanese formation early on 24 October 1944. At 03:49 that morning, &quot;Besugo&quot; closed a Japanese tanker, protected by two coast defense frigates and a destroyer, intending to sneak between two of the escorts for a shot at the tanker. However, two rapid Japanese zigzags away put the tanker out of reach, so &quot;Besugo&quot; turned on the port-quarter escort instead. She fired three torpedoes at the escort, the frigate &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 132&quot;, and, at 04:15, at least one torpedo hit the target. In a blinding flash, the frigate suddenly blew up, illuminating the entire area and silhouetting &quot;Besugo&quot; on the surface. She crash-dived, expecting to be depth-charged by the rear escort, but no counterattack attack materialized.

Over the next week, &quot;Besugo&quot; and up to six other U.S. submarines patrolled the approaches to Van Diemen Strait (also known as Ōsumi Strait) and the east coast of Kyushu, hoping to catch some of the Japanese warships retiring north from their defeat in the waters around the Philippine Islands in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The only things &quot;Besugo&quot; spotted were three Japanese patrol planes, a Japanese submarine′s periscope, and a drifting contact mine, all of which she evaded with some difficulty. Retiring to the Mariana Islands on 1 November 1944, &quot;Besugo&quot; concluded her patrol by mooring alongside the submarine tender at Saipan on 5 November 1944.

=====Second war patrol=====
Following minor repairs and a torpedo reload, &quot;Besugo&quot; departed Tanapag Harbor at Saipan to begin her second war patrol on 10 November 1944. Transiting the Luzon Strait on 16 November 1944, she entered the South China Sea, and she took up a position off Linapacan Island in the Philippine Islands on 20 November. At 04:55 on 22 November, &quot;Besugo&quot; picked up a radar contact while operating off the northern tip of Palawan. Owing to the approaching dawn, she attacked the target quickly, firing four torpedoes at what she believed was a Japanese tanker. One torpedo hit amidships, starting an enormous fire that eventually sank what turned out to be the Japanese landing ship &quot;T.151&quot;. A few minutes later, she spotted a barge nearby, probably a tow abandoned by the stricken landing ship, and sank it with two torpedoes.

Returning to her patrol station that evening, &quot;Besugo&quot; encountered rough weather, and the heavy swells interfered with her surface search radar. At 21:38, she closed her only good contact and fired four bow torpedoes at a large vessel. All missed, possibly because they grounded in the shallow water. Over the next 10 minutes, she fired eight more torpedoes, one of which finally hit and brought to a stop what turned out to be a cargo ship. &quot;Besugo&quot; then fired her last four torpedoes into the target. Two of them demolished the midships section and the ship settled to the bottom in of water, leaving the superstructure still visible above the surface. A postwar records review, however, did not indicate any Japanese losses in that area, and &quot;Besugo&quot; did not receive credit for a sinking. With her torpedoes gone, &quot;Besugo&quot; headed south, passed through the Lombok Strait, and arrived at Fremantle, Australia, on 4 December 1944, bringing her patrol to an end.

=====Third war patrol=====
After a refit alongside the submarine tender , &quot;Besugo&quot; got underway for her third war patrol on 24 December 1944. She passed through Lombok Strait late on 30 December and entered the Celebes Sea. On 31 December 1944 she sighted a small Japanese merchant ship emerging from a rain squall. &quot;Besugo&quot; dove and attacked with three torpedoes, but all missed, and the target escaped and disappeared from view. It probably radioed in a contact report, because searching Japanese aircraft later forced &quot;Besugo&quot; to submerge four times.

Clearing Karimata Strait on 2 January 1945, &quot;Besugo&quot; took up a patrol station off the southern tip of Japanese-occupied French Indochina on 4 January. At 18:40 on 6 January, her lookouts sighted the heavily laden Japanese 10,020-gross register ton tanker &quot;Nichei Maru&quot; escorted by a destroyer and two coast defense frigates. She closed undetected and at 21:18 fired six torpedoes at &quot;Nichei Maru&quot;. Three of the torpedoes hit home, and &quot;Nichei Maru&quot; burst into flame and sank. As &quot;Besugo&quot; cleared the area, the escorts dropped seven depth charges in desultory and ineffective attacks.

Joined by the submarines , , and later , &quot;Besugo&quot; spent the next two weeks fruitlessly patrolling a scouting line south of the Cà Mau Peninsula. Finally, at 05:30 on 24 January 1945, she received a contact report from &quot;Blackfin&quot;. As &quot;Besugo&quot; closed the three Japanese ships (destroyer , the tanker &quot;Sarawak Maru&quot;, and a small minesweeper) &quot;Blackfin&quot; reported, her crew heard &quot;Blackfin&quot; send one torpedo into the tanker. Shortly thereafter, the Japanese escorts drove &quot;Besugo&quot; off with gunfire and depth charges. Twenty minutes later, &quot;Besugo&quot; tried approaching again and, despite sonar searches and a close depth-charge attack by the escorts, she fired six torpedoes at the tanker. The torpedo tracks attracted the attention of the escorts, and &quot;Besugo&quot; endured a furious pounding from the two escorts, who dropped a total of 22 depth charges over the next half hour. Later that afternoon, &quot;Besugo&quot;′s crew heard Japanese escorts drop another 32 depth charges. A postwar records review determined the tanker to have been damaged in the attack.

A week later, &quot;Besugo&quot; discovered four Japanese antisubmarine warfare vessels conducting a sound sweep off Cape Laguan on the Malay Peninsula. After calling in &quot;Blackfin&quot; and &quot;Hardhead&quot; for help, &quot;Besugo&quot; crept under the right-flank ship and took up a firing position. At 02:27 on 2 February 1945, she fired four torpedoes at the right-center ship, and one of them hit and sank the frigate &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 144&quot;. &quot;Besugo&quot; easily evaded the ensuing counterattack and withdrew from the area. As no further contacts developed, she set a course for Australia on 5 February 1945, transited Lombok Strait on 8 February, and moored alongside the submarine tender in the harbor at Fremantle on 15 February 1945.

=====Fourth war patrol=====

As the port at Fremantle was very busy, &quot;Besugo&quot;′s refit was delayed for two weeks, and she was not ready for operations until 24 March 1945. Underway that same day to begin her fourth war patrol, &quot;Besugo&quot; proceeded to a patrol area in the eastern Java Sea. Passing through Lombok Strait on 31 March, she joined the submarines &quot;Gabilan&quot; and and took up a position near Bangka Island off Sumatra on 3 April 1945.

On 4 April 1945, while patrolling submerged, &quot;Besugo&quot; contacted an enemy group consisting of a cruiser, three torpedo boats, and a minesweeper. After they passed over the horizon, she surfaced, radioed a contact report, and set out in pursuit of the Japanese force. During the afternoon and evening, she tried to work around the Japanese task group, but Japanese aircraft forced her to dive four times. Finally, at 03:58 on 5 April, after a long night of maneuvering, she fired six torpedoes at the cruiser, but all of them missed. A nearby escort then forced &quot;Besugo&quot; to dive and dropped 13 depth charges in the area before &quot;Besugo&quot; escaped.

Later on the morning of 5 April 1945, &quot;Besugo&quot; received orders to patrol the Sumba Strait while Allied aircraft from Australia attempted to sink the elusive Japanese task group. &quot;Besugo&quot;′s crew hoped that at the very least, the air attacks might force the Japanese warships to retire past &quot;Besugo&quot;′s position, and on 6 April 1945 sighted the Japanese ships doing exactly that. Unfortunately for &quot;Besugo&quot;, the cruiser&#x27;s high speed and haze gray camouflage allowed her to surprise &quot;Besugo&quot;, quickly slipping by her and evading all nine torpedoes &quot;Besugo&quot; fired hastily.

Despite the appearance of Japanese patrol planes, &quot;Besugo&quot; was better prepared for the trailing Japanese escorts, and she blew the minesweeper &quot;W.12&quot; in half with one of four torpedoes fired. Although &quot;W.12&quot;′s bow sank immediately, her stern remained afloat in a sea filled with Japanese sailors abandoning ship. Before &quot;Besugo&quot; could fire a torpedo at &quot;W.12&quot;′s stern section, a sudden attack by a Japanese patrol plane forced &quot;Besugo&quot; to break off the attack and dive to safety. &quot;Besugo&quot; spent the next two hours dodging Japanese air attacks; she was bombed once and strafed twice, before finally sinking &quot;W.12&quot;′s stern section with her last torpedo.

&quot;Besugo&quot; then returned to Fremantle on 11 April 1945 for another load of torpedoes, before putting to sea on 16 April to continue her patrol. Transiting Lombok Strait on 21 April, she took up a patrol station in the Java Sea in company with the submarines and . On 23 April, she spotted unusual prey, the German submarine painted with Japanese colors, and sank her with a torpedo at , becoming one of only a very few American submarines to sink a German warship. Quickly surfacing, &quot;Besugo&quot; recovered &quot;U-183&quot;′s only survivor, a badly wounded German warrant officer.

&quot;Besugo&quot; sighted nothing of interest again until 28 April 1945, when she began tracking a Japanese guard boat. Surfacing at 02:20 on 29 April, she quickly sank &quot;Otome Maru&quot; with gunfire. On the evening of 29 April, after closing with an immense pillar of fire spotted over the horizon, &quot;Besugo&quot; rescued a badly burned sailor, most likely from the Imperial Japanese Army tanker &quot;Yuno Maru&quot;, recently sunk by a mine. From then until 12 May 1945, &quot;Besugo&quot; patrolled off Java between Surabaya and Batavia, scouting for any Japanese warships responding to the Allied landings on Borneo. After swinging through the Gulf of Siam, &quot;Besugo&quot; concluded her patrol, arriving at Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands on 20 May 1945.

=====Fifth war patrol=====
Following a refit alongside &quot;Anthedon&quot;, &quot;Besugo&quot; got underway for her fifth war patrol on 13 June 1945. proceeding southeast to French Indochina, &quot;Besugo&quot; spent close to three uneventful weeks on a lifeguard station off Camranh Bay in support of Allied airstrikes. Then, on 5 July 1945, she moved to the south coast of Borneo but again made no contacts with Japanese ships. After transiting Lombok Strait, she arrived at Fremantle on 25 July 1945 and received a refit alongside the submarine tender . &quot;Besugo&quot; was at Fremantle when hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945, bringing World War II to an end.

====Post-World War II====
=====1946–1949=====
&quot;Besugo&quot; departed Fremantle on 29 August 1945, when she proceed south and east to Sydney, Australia, which she reached on 5 September 1945. She got back underway on 7 September 1945 to proceed to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 26 September 1945. She had an extended period of shore leave and upkeep at San Diego, she proceeded to Vallejo, California, where on 31 October 1945 she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard (renamed the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in November 1945 — on Mare Island for an overhaul.

Upon completion of her overhaul on 8 February 1946, &quot;Besugo&quot; headed to Pearl Harbor for duty with the United States Pacific Fleet. She made a cruise to Guam in the Mariana Islands. then returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 May 1946. She then operated locally in Hawaiian waters, included training at the French Frigate Shoals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in December 1946 and a simulated attack exercise against the light cruiser in January 1947. Between 3 February and 5 May 1947, she received another overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard before returning to Pearl Harbor on 13 May 1947.

With the Cold War beginning amid growing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the U.S. Navy began planning for possible confrontations with the Soviet Navy. One training measure, devised to give submarine crews experience was the &quot;simulated war patrol,&quot; a mission upon which&quot; Besugo&quot; embarked on 7 June 1947. Heading west from Hawaii, she avoided numerous air and surface contacts in an attempt to avoid detection by U.S. forces en route to the Marshall Islands. Arriving off Majuro Atoll on 18 June 1947, she conducted a photographic reconnaissance of the area before heading on to the Philippines. After a stop at Subic Bay from 4 to 7 July 1947, where she provided target services to Martin PBM Mariner and Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol aircraft of Fleet Air Wing 1, proceeded to Hong Kong on 8 July. There, the crew enjoyed shore leave under the &quot;care&quot; of the British light cruiser . &quot;Besugo&quot; moved on to Qingdao, China, where she arrived on 18 July 1947 and began a six-week series of exercises with United States Seventh Fleet units in the Yellow Sea. These included radar tracking drills with the submarine , salvage drills with the submarine rescue vessel , and, in company with the submarine , a simulated attack exercise against a task force. During the latter, aircraft contacts plagued the two submarines, which failed to make any successful attacks. After stops to refuel at Okinawa and Midway Atoll, &quot;Besugo&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 September 1947.

&quot;Besugo&quot; remained in Hawaiian waters until July 1948, conducting routine upkeep and local training operations. Then, following a visit to Hilo, Hawaii, from 3 and 8 July 1948, she got underway on 9 July 1948 for a reconnaissance mission to the Bering Sea. Arriving at Adak in the Aleutian Islands on 16 July 1948, she headed east and rendezvoused with the submarine on 18 July. After exchanging information with &quot;Diodon&quot;, &quot;Besugo&quot; moved to St. Lawrence Island on 19 July and began three weeks of photo reconnaissance operations off Cape Navarin on the coast of the Soviet Union at the southern extremity of the Gulf of Anadyr. During this time, she sighted three Soviet warships — a destroyer escort, a patrol frigate, and a minesweeper — and six cargo ships, all without being detected. After a rendezvous with the submarine &quot;Blower&quot; on 10 August 1948, &quot;Besugo&quot; proceeded to Adak and Kodiak, Alaska, before returning to Pearl Harbor on 20 July 1948. She remained in Hawaiian waters for the next 18 months, conducting independent ship&#x27;s drills, antisubmarine warfare exercises, and other local operations from Pearl Harbor.

=====1950–1958=====
Despite the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, &quot;Besugo&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for an overhaul not long thereafter. Completing the overhaul on 28 September 1950, she departed Pearl Harbor on 19 October 1950 bound for Yokosuka, Japan, which she reached on 31 October 1950. After four weeks of training, including target services for U.S. antisubmarine warfare planes and warships, she began the first of her two Korean War reconnaissance patrols. Leaving Japan on 6 December 1950, she passed through the Tsugaru Strait and took up a patrol station off La Perouse Strait north of Hokkaido on 9 December. There, in spite of rough seas and a succession of snowstorms, she spent two weeks tracking Soviet shipping moving between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan. Returning to Yokosuka in late December 1950, she remained in Japanese waters for the next three months, conducting local operations and twice visiting Okinawa. During her first visit to Okinawa, she proceeded to Naze Ko on Omami o Shima on 12 January 1951 to rescue six survivors of a PBM Mariner flying boat that had crashed. Departing the Far East on 11 April 1951, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 22 April 1951.

Following nine months of local operations in Hawaiian waters and two shipyard periods, during which new sonar equipment and mine clearing cables were installed, &quot;Besugo&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor on 7 January 1952 bound for Subic Bay in the Philippines. Arriving there on 24 January 1952, &quot;Besugo&quot; embarked on her second special mission the following day. Ordered to conduct a photograpic reconnaissance of Hainan Island, she took up a submerged patrol station off Yulin Bay on 28 January 1952. Frequent contacts with fishing sampans, and even with entire fishing fleets on a half-dozen occasions, made surveillance and photographic operations very difficult. In addition, the sampans constituted an even greater hazard at night, since they had no running lights and registered poorly on radar. As a result, the mission produced limited results. &quot;Besugo&quot; returned to Subic Bay on 28 February 1952, and then to Pearl Harbor in March 1952, after which &quot;Besugo&quot;′s crew received a two-month leave and upkeep period.

After the two-month leave-and-upkeep period, &quot;Besugo&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a three-month overhaul in July 1952. The shipyard work was complete in September 1952, but a small electrical fire on 23 October 1952 delayed her return to service until December 1952. Departing Pearl Harbor on 31 January 1953, she headed northeast for a visit to Puget Sound, Washington, and its environs. Between 9 February and 22 March 1953, she visited Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada, and Seattle, Washington, before conducting a training exercise off Cape Flattery, Washington. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1953, and her only other movement later in the spring of 1953 was a mid-May visit in Hawaiian waters to Nawiliwili Bay on Kauai.

Assigned to training duty for United States Naval Reserve personnel, &quot;Besugo&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 2 August 1953 and arrived at her new home port of San Diego, California, on 9 August. She conducted local operations in nearby waters for the next five years, including the provision of target services to local fleet units, and made occasional operational and Naval Reserve training cruises. Her first training cruise took place in the autumn of 1954, when she proceeded from San Diego to Lahaina Roads in Hawaii and laid a drill minefield on 21 October 1954.

In the autumn of 1955, &quot;Besugo&quot; visited the Puget Sound area again for antisubmarine warfare exercises with Royal Canadian Navy warships and a U.S. Naval Reserve training cruise. She received an overhaul in San Francisco, California, during the spring of 1956. In January 1957, in company with the submarine , she made a cruise sto Mexico which included a port visit at Mazatlan. She carried out Naval Reserve reserve training duties in Puget Sound in February 1957. In August 1957, she proceeded to San Francisco for antisubmarine warfare exercises, and in November 1957 she again visited Mazatlan.

=====1958–1966=====
Never having been modernized, &quot;Besugo&quot; was scheduled for inactivation in 1958. She departed San Diego for the last time on 6 January 1958 and entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard to commence deactivation procedures on 8 January 1958. She was decommissioned on 21 March 1958 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. While in reserve, she was reclsassified an &quot;auxiliary research submarine&quot; and given the hull classification symbol AGSS-321 in 1962.

&quot;Besugo&quot; was recommissioned on 15 June 1965. She was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine in 1966.

===Italian Navy===

After the completion of her Fleet Snorkel conversion, &quot;Besugo&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 1966 and transferred on loan to Italy the same day. The Italian Navy commissioned her as &quot;Francesco Morosini&quot; (S 508), named for Francesco Morosini (1619–1694), who was Doge of Venice from 1688 to 1694.

The Italian Navy decommissioned &quot;Francesco Morosini&quot; on 30 November 1973. It struck her from its naval vessel register on 15 November 1975 and returned her to U.S. Navy custody on the same day.

==Disposal==
The submarine was struck from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 15 November 1975, the day Italy returned her to the United States. She was sold either on 16 April 1976 or 20 June 1977 (according to different sources) for scrapping.

<doc id="1123703" wikidata="Q2348479" url="?curid=1123703" title="Thiago Martins (footballer, born 1976)">
<text>Thiago Martins (born 4 September 1976) is a retired Brazilian footballer who played professionally in the United States and Norway.

==Early life and education==
Martins was born on the east side of São Paulo, Brazil, and came to the United States in 1996. He landed in Los Angeles, at 19 years old and with little money. He eventually made his way to Santa Barbara, California, where he slept in hotels until his money ran out. He had to resort to sleeping on the beach. Fortunately, he awoke one morning to a group of people playing soccer on the beach and joined them. One of the players took Martins into their home, even though Martins spoke little English or Spanish and they spoke no Portuguese. He began to play soccer in Sunday leagues, where Tim Vom Steeg noticed his skill as he attempted to defend him in one game.

Thiago agreed and started taking classes at Santa Barbara City College, where he played soccer for two years from 1997 to 1998 under head coach Tim Vom Steeg. Vom Steeg soon moved to nearby University of California, Santa Barbara to take up their head coaching position with Martins also transferring.

In 1999, his first season with the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men&#x27;s soccer team, he only played in 11 games due to a broken metatarsal, but still managed to score 6 goals. In his second season with UCSB, he scored 6 goals and assisted on 2 others for a point total of 14. He appeared in 18 matches and was named to the All-Big West Conference First Team.

==Professional career==
===USL A-League===
Martins left UC Santa Barbara after the 2000 season to play for the now-defunct San Diego Flash of the A-League. He was drafted 56th overall in the 2001 A-League Draft, catching the eye of Colin Clarke, after putting in stellar performances with UC Santa Barbara and getting his green card during his senior year. After their demise at the end of the 2001 season, Martins joined fellow A-League team Minnesota Thunder, where he scored 2 goals in 11 appearances. Martins was subsequently released and moved to his third A-League side in Pittsburgh Riverhounds. With Pittsburgh, Martins hit his stride, scoring 8 goals in only 576 minutes over 8 games. Martins shined in the 2003 season, during which he scored 22 goals and had 7 assists in 25 games for the Riverhounds. For his performances, he was named the A-League MVP. After the end of the A-League season, Martins joined Major League Soccer team D.C. United.

===Major League Soccer===
With United, he played in five games before the end of the season. While training following the 2003 season, Martins tore his left ACL. After an extensive rehabilitation process which saw him close to returning to the team, he tore the ACL again. As a result, Martins missed all of United&#x27;s 2004 season. After the season, Martins was selected 17th overall by Club Deportivo Chivas USA in the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft. He scored the first goal in club history in its second match, a 3–3 draw with San Jose Earthquakes. Martins went on to score two more goals during the season.

Martins was traded to MetroStars, with a partial allocation, for Ante Razov in January 2006. He played just one game for the re-branded New York Red Bulls before again being traded, this time to Colorado Rapids, for Peguero Jean Philippe. At the conclusion of the season, he signed with FK Bodø/Glimt of the Adeccoligaen in Norway.

===FK Bodø/Glimt===
Against Tippeligaen side Tromsø IL, he scored two goals in FK Bodø/Glimt&#x27;s 3–1 away win in the last game before the 2007 campaign. Martins suffered a knee injury in this game and was not 100% when he made his Bodø/Glimt debut in an obligatory match on 9 April 2007, away to Hønefoss BK. Martins contributed greatly for his new club becoming top-scorer as well as scoring in the play-offs. As a result, Martins and FK Bodø/Glimt gained promotion back to the Norwegian Tippeligaen for the 2008 season. Martins had a good year with FK Bodø/Glimt in 2008, and finished fourth even though he was injured for most of the season. However, the success did not last long and Glimt were relegated at the end of the 2009 after a very poor season in Tippeligaen. 2010 started promising for FK Bodø/Glimt in Adeccoligaen, but their initial good form declined, and they ultimately ended up in sixth place. Martins&#x27; contract expired at the end of 2010, and FK Bodø/Glimt decided to not offer him a new deal. He subsequently retired from professional soccer.

==Personal life==
In 2016, Martins was teaching special-needs children and coaching a semi-professional Norwegian soccer team. When not teaching or coaching, he surfs and in October 2016 participated in the Lofoten Masters surfing competition in Unstad in the Lofoten Islands of Norway.

<text>Milter (portmanteau for &quot;mail filter&quot;) is an extension to the widely used open source mail transfer agents (MTA) Sendmail and Postfix. It allows administrators to add mail filters for filtering spam or viruses in the mail-processing chain. In the language of the art, &quot;milter&quot; refers to the protocol and API implementing the service, while &quot;a milter&quot; has come to refer to a filter application that uses milter to provide service.

==History==
Prior to the advent of milter, an email filter was generally implemented as a program to which an MTA would hand the message once it has completely arrived, with most of the message&#x27;s envelope information removed. That program could then analyze the header and body of the message and make a decision to accept the message (i.e. return a &quot;success&quot; status to the MTA) or reject it (i.e. return a &quot;failed&quot; status to the MTA). The MTA would then log a successful delivery or return a failure message to the sender as appropriate, and the filter would be responsible for affecting the delivery of the message (to the intended inbox(es) as-is, or modified to remove unwanted content, or to specific folder(s), etc.).

An MTA that is milter-capable instead notifies filters to which it is connected about each phase of the delivery of a message, from initial client connection through completion of transmission. At each phase of the SMTP session, the filter is given data about the arriving message and then has an opportunity to terminate acceptance of the message early when appropriate. For very large messages, this can have an enormous impact when a decision to reject can be made as early as possible. Moreover, unlike the former model, a milter-capable MTA can connect to multiple filters in parallel that serve specific purposes such as anti-virus, anti-spam, message authentication, flow regulation, etc. Finally, such filters can take special action on the message: add or remove recipients in the envelope; alter the body prior to delivery; add, change or remove header fields in the message, etc.

The Sendmail Consortium includes a special thread-based library in the sendmail distribution that provides the milter API.

==MTAs==

===Sendmail===
Milter was first officially introduced to Sendmail 8.12.0 released on September 8, 2001. Milter was available in sendmail 8.11.x versions as an FFR (For Future Release/Beta code). Milter has undergone substantial improvements since its first official release.

===Postfix===
Milter support was added to Postfix 2.3.0 released July 12, 2006. Many, but not all, milters can be used with Postfix &quot;out of the box&quot;.

==Interface==
The Sendmail Consortium provides a documented Application Programming Interface that can be used to create milters for special needs. The library provided by The Sendmail Consortium is pthread-based. However, documentation of the protocol used for communication between sendmail and milter processes is not provided. This internal protocol is subject to changes in new sendmail versions.

<doc id="1123708" wikidata="Q25379699" url="?curid=1123708" title="Hurler syndrome">
<text>Hurler syndrome, also known as [[mucopolysaccharidosis]] Type IH (MPS-IH), Hurler&#x27;s disease, and formerly [[gargoyle|gargoylism]], is a genetic disorder that results in the buildup of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. The inability to break down these molecules results in a wide variety of symptoms caused by damage to several different organ systems, including but not limited to the nervous system, skeletal system, eyes, and heart.

The underlying mechanism is a deficiency of alpha-L iduronidase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down GAGs. Without this enzyme, a buildup of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate occurs in the body. Symptoms appear during childhood, and early death usually occurs. Other, less severe forms of MPS Type I include Hurler–Scheie syndrome (MPS-IHS) and Scheie syndrome (MPS-IS).

Hurler syndrome is classified as a lysosomal storage disease. It is clinically related to Hunter syndrome (MPS II); however, Hunter syndrome is X-linked, while Hurler syndrome is autosomal recessive.

==Signs and symptoms==
Children with Hurler syndrome may appear normal at birth and develop symptoms over the first years of life. Symptoms vary between patients.

One of the first abnormalities that may be detected is coarsening of the facial features; these symptoms can begin at 3–6 months of age. The head can be large with prominent frontal bones. The skull can be elongated. The nose can have a flattened nasal bridge with continuous nasal discharge. The eye sockets may be widely spaced, and the eyes may protrude from the skull. The lips can be large, and affected children may hold their jaws open constantly. Skeletal abnormalities occur by about age 6 months, but may not be clinically obvious until 10–14 months. Patients may experience debilitating spine and hip deformities, carpal tunnel syndrome, and joint stiffness. Patients may be normal height in infancy, but stop growing by the age of two years. They may not reach a height of greater than .

Other early symptoms may include inguinal and umbilical hernias. These may be present at birth, or they may develop within the first months of life. Clouding of the cornea and retinal degeneration may occur within the first year of life, leading to blindness. Enlarged liver and spleen are common. There is no organ dysfunction, but GAG deposition in these organs may lead to a massive increase in size. Patients may also have diarrhea. Aortic valve disease may occur.

Airway obstruction is frequent, usually secondary to abnormal cervical vertebrae. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections can be frequent.

Developmental delay may become apparent by age 1–2 years, with a maximum functional age of 2–4 years. Progressive deterioration follows. Most children develop limited language capabilities. Death usually occurs by age 10.

==Genetics==

Children with Hurler syndrome carry two defective copies of the &quot;IDUA&quot; gene, which has been mapped to the 4p16.3 site on chromosome 4. This is the gene which encodes for the protein iduronidase. , more than 201 different mutations in the &quot;IDUA&quot; gene have been shown to cause MPS I.

Because Hurler syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, affected persons have two nonworking copies of the gene. A person born with one normal copy and one defective copy is called a carrier. They will produce less α-L-iduronidase than an individual with two normal copies of the gene. The reduced production of the enzyme in carriers, however, remains sufficient for normal function; the person should not show any symptoms of the disease.
==Mechanisms==

The IDUA gene is responsible for encoding an enzyme called alpha-L-iduronidase. Through hydrolysis, alpha-L-iduronidase is responsible for breaking down a molecule called unsulfated alpha-L-iduronic acid. This is a uronic acid found in the GAGs dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. The alpha-L-iduronidase enzyme is located in lysosomes. Without sufficient enzymatic function, these GAGs cannot be digested properly.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis often can be made through clinical examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis of one of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who have a family history of the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.

===Classification===
All members of the mucopolysaccharidosis family are also lysosomal storage diseases. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is divided into three subtypes based on severity of symptoms. All three types result the absence or decreased functioning of the same enzyme. MPS-IH (Hurler syndrome) is the most severe of the MPS I subtypes. The other two types are MPS-IS (Scheie syndrome) and MPS-IHS (Hurler–Scheie syndrome).

Because of the substantial overlap between Hurler syndrome, Hurler–Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome, some sources consider these terms to be outdated. Instead, MPS I may be divided into &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;attenuated&quot; forms.

==Treatment==
There is currently no cure for Hurler syndrome. Enzyme replacement therapy with iduronidase (Aldurazyme) may improve pulmonary function and mobility. It can reduce the amount of carbohydrates being improperly stored in organs. Surgical correction of hand and foot deformities may be necessary. Corneal surgery may help alleviate vision problems.

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) can be used as treatments for MPS I. BMT from siblings with identical HLA genes and from relatives with similar HLA genes can significantly improve survival, cognitive function, and physical symptoms. Patients can develop graft versus host disease; this is more likely in non-sibling donors. In a 1998 study, children with HLA-identical sibling donors had a five-year survival of 75%; children with non-sibling donors had a five-year survival of 53%.

Children often lack access to a suitable bone marrow donor. In these cases, UCBT from unrelated donors can increase survival, decrease physical signs of the disease, and improve cognition. Complications from this treatment may include graft versus host disease.

== Prognosis ==
A British study from 2008 found a median estimated life expectancy of 8.7 years for patients with Hurler syndrome. In comparison, the median life expectancy for all forms of MPS type I was 11.6 years. Patients who received successful bone marrow transplants had a 2-year survival rate of 68% and a 10-year survival rate of 64%. Patients who did not receive bone marrow transplants had a significantly reduced lifespan, with a median age of 6.8 years.

==Epidemiology==
Hurler syndrome has an overall frequency of one per 100,000. Combined, all of the mucopolysaccharidoses have a frequency of approximately one in every 25,000 births in the United States.

==Research==
===Gene therapy===
A great deal of interest exists in treating MPS I with gene therapy. In animal models, delivery of the iduronidase gene has been accomplished with retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, and plasmid vectors. Mice and dogs with MPS I have been successfully treated with gene therapy. Most vectors can correct the disease in the liver and spleen, and can correct brain effects with a high dosage. Gene therapy has improved survival, neurological, and physical symptoms; however, some animals have developed unexplained liver tumors. If safety issues can be resolved, gene therapy may provide an alternative human treatment for MPS disorders in the future.

Sangamo Therapeutics, headquartered in Richmond, California, is currently conducting a clinical trial involving gene editing using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) for the treatment of MPS I.
==History==
In 1919, Gertrud Hurler, a German pediatrician, described a syndrome involving corneal clouding, skeletal abnormalities, and mental retardation. A similar disease of &quot;gargoylism&quot; had been described in 1917 by Charles A. Hunter. Hurler did not mention Hunter&#x27;s paper. Because of the communications interruptions caused by World War I, it is likely that she was unaware of his study. Hurler syndrome now refers to MPS IH, while Hunter syndrome refers to MPS II. In 1962, a milder form of MPS I was identified by Scheie, leading to the designation of Scheie syndrome.

<text>The Shing Mun Country Park (established 24 June 1977) is a country park of Hong Kong, hugging the Shing Mun Reservoir.

==Location==
Located in the central New Territories, it covers a total of . It extends from Lead Mine Pass in the north, to the Shing Mun catchwater road in the south, and from Tai Mo Shan in the west to Grassy Hill and Needle Hill in the east.&lt;br&gt;

==History==
As early as 1971, a &quot;pilot scheme&quot; was initiated and prototype picnic facilities were provided, using funds from Sir David Trench Fund for Recreation. These were well received by visitors. In 1977, the area was formally designated as a country park.

==Vegetation==
At the head of the reservoir near the former Tai Wai Village, a &quot;fung shui&quot; grove contains a rich variety of more than 70 species of trees. It has been designated as a &quot;special area&quot; that merits special protection. To the west of the reservoir, both sides of the stream known as Tai Shing Shek Kan are covered with a rich variety of shrubs, grasses and trees, including several species of Camellia, &quot;Camellia granthamiana&quot;, which bears beautiful white flowers more than 12 cm in diameter, is a rare species found only a few decades ago. It is named after a former Hong Kong Governor, Sir Alexander Grantham.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in World War II, most of the trees in the park were cut down. Extensive reforestation was carried out after the war. The main species was &quot;Pinus massoniana&quot;, whilst &quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;, &quot;Lophostemon confertus&quot;, &quot;Melaleuca quinquenervia&quot; and &quot;Acacia confusa&quot; were introduced later. The area has now become one of the major forest plantations in Hong Kong.

==Wildlife==
As the park is situated close to the densely populated urban area of Tsuen Wan, wildlife is seldom seen. Apart from a few common birds, other animals such as squirrels, barking deer, wild boars and pangolins may occasionally be discovered. Some monkeys, believed to have migrated from nearby Kam Shan Country Park, can sometimes be found along the forest tracks.

==Geology==
The land in this area is composed of granitic and volcanic rocks. The latter form the highest ground, while the granitic rocks, which weather relatively easily, form the lower areas in the southern parts of the park. To the east of the park is a rich deposit of wolfram which was first mined in 1936. Mining was interrupted during World War II. With the high post-war prices, mining was resumed in 1951 and continued until 1968 when the prices again fell drastically. The highest average monthly output in the latter period was 30 tonnes, and was entirely for export. There are several abandoned lead mine workings around Lead Mine Pass, some of which date back several centuries.

==Features==
===Shing Mun Country Park Visitor Centre===

The Shing Mun Country Park Visitor Centre, is situated near the maxicab terminus. 
 It provides displays on the origin and history of Shing Mun, the reservoir and the mining industry in the early 20th centuries. Animals and mineral specimens are also on display. Video programmes on Country Parks and Countryside Conservation matters are shown in the visitor centre at regular intervals.

===Shing Mun Arboretum===

The Shing Mun Arboretum, occupies 4 hectares of land (40,000 square meters), is situated in the Country Park. It extends to Shing Mun Reservoir Road in the south. The western border lies in Tai Mo Shan, while Grassy Hill and Needle Hill mark the eastern margin. 

==== History ====
The Shing Mun Arboretum was established in the 1970s. The land it was built upon were old terraced fields. Trees were planted there at around the same time. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has been expanding the Arboretum by planting diverse species of valuable, rare and endangered plants. The arboretum also contains many native plants through the department’s efforts.

==== Specimens ====
There are 7000 plants, belonging to over 300 species (which are native to Hong Kong or Southern China) in the Arboretum. The plants include a collection of bamboos, protected plant species, plants named after Botanists, plants first discovered in Hong Kong and Camellias (example include Grantham’s camellia), etc.

The Shi

===Other facilities===
At the park entrance a large information board and a direction post have been erected, providing visitors with information and guidance. Barbecue facilities are provided throughout the areas to the south and south-east of the reservoir, near the dams. Toilets, a refreshment kiosk, rain-shelters, warden posts, jogging trails, a nature trail, viewcompasses and many other facilities are also provided. Sections 7 and 8 of the MacLehose Trail run through the Park from Smugglers&#x27; Ridge in the south-east of the park to Route Twisk in the west. A campsite is provided near Lead Mine Pass for trail hikers.

==Transport==
Visitors are advised to use public transport, as there is no parking space in the park. The Transport Department also prohibits coaches and private buses from using the Shing Mun Road leading to the park because of the narrowness of the road. Minibus 82 runs between Shiu Wo Street (HairTrend), Tsuen Wan and Shing Mun Reservoir.

<text>Marcelo Saragosa (born 22 January 1982) is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He is the Director of Soccer Operations for Austin Bold FC in the USL Championship.

==Career==

===Professional===
Born in Campo Grande, Saragosa began his career with Brazilian team São Paulo, having signed with their youth team at the age of 13. He was sent on loan to the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer in 2004 where he started in 24 of 26 games for the Galaxy. He then returned to São Paulo, before being signed to a permanent deal by the Galaxy in August 2005.

After starting in 10 of the first 15 games of the 2006 season for the Galaxy, Saragosa was traded to FC Dallas on July 19, 2006, in exchange for a fourth round supplemental draft pick in 2007. 2007 was a season riddled with injuries; he suffered a sprained right medial collateral ligament on April 14, 2007, which kept him out four weeks and appeared in only 13 games for FC Dallas before having surgery to repair a torn meniscus on September 25, 2007.

In 2008, Saragosa appeared in 25 games for FC Dallas and scored the second goal of his MLS career on October 18, 2008, in a 3–1 loss versus Real Salt Lake. Shortly before the last game of the regular season, Saragosa had surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee on October 21, 2008. Saragosa was traded to Chivas USA in exchange for Atiba Harris on July 17, 2009. While with Chivas Saragosa appeared in 22 league matches.

After the 2010 MLS season Chivas USA declined Saragosa&#x27;s contract option and Saragosa elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Saragosa became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft. In November 2010, Saragosa&#x27;s blog announced he was suffering from cancer.
On February 16, 2012, it was announced that Saragosa had returned to Major League Soccer signing with D.C. United. Saragosa&#x27;s club option declined following the 2013 season.

After taking 2014 off, Saragosa signed with North American Soccer League side Tampa Bay Rowdies on February 3, 2015. During an April 1 season kickoff event at the Mahaffey Theater, Saragosa was named captain of the 2015 Rowdies. Saragosa was released by Tampa Bay in November 2015.

On April 18, 2019, Austin Bold FC announced that Saragosa would be moving from his role as player to be the club&#x27;s Director of Soccer Operations.

<text>The Zanzibar bushbaby, Matundu dwarf galago, Udzungwa bushbaby, or Zanzibar galago (Paragalago zanzibaricus) is a primate of the family Galagidae. An adult typically weighs , its head-body length is and its tail is between long. Like other species of galagos, its diet consists mainly of fruit, insects, and tree gums.

It is the most widespread and abundant bushbaby in the coastal forests of Tanzania. It is thought to prefer the mid to high canopy of tropical coastal forest, submontane and lowland tropical forest. It has one or two young per year.

There are two subspecies of this bushbaby:
*&quot;P. z. zanzibaricus&quot;, from Zanzibar
*&quot;P. z. udzungwensis&quot;, from mainland Tanzania

<text>Shing Mun () is an area between Tsuen Wan and Sha Tin in the New Territories of Hong Kong. It used to be, as suggested by its Chinese characters, a gate between the two areas separated by a range of hills.

==History==
Before the construction of Shing Mun Reservoir, there were several villages near the valley. Some of these villages were later relocated near the Tsuen Wan entrance of Shing Mun Tunnels.

The area played a major role in the defense against Japanese Invasion of Hong Kong. Gin Drinkers Line is across the area.

==Featured named after Shing Mun==
Because there were many major constructions and geography features in the area, Shing Mun may mean one of the following by context:
* Shing Mun Country Park, which contains the Shing Mun Reservoir
* Shing Mun Redoubt, which housed command HQ for the Gin Drinkers Line
* Shing Mun River

<doc id="1123720" wikidata="Q1759389" url="?curid=1123720" title="Gunther disease">
<text>Günther disease is a congenital form of erythropoietic porphyria. The word porphyria originated from the Greek word porphura. Porphura actually means &quot;purple pigment&quot;, which, in suggestion, the color that the body fluid changes when a person has Gunther&#x27;s disease. It is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting heme, caused by deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen cosynthetase. It is extremely rare, with a prevalence estimated at 1 in 1,000,000 or less. There have been times that prior to birth of a fetus, Gunther&#x27;s disease has been shown to lead to anemia. In milder cases patients have not presented any symptoms until they have reached adulthood. In Gunther&#x27;s disease, porphyrins are accumulated in the teeth and bones and an increased amount are seen in the plasma, bone marrow, feces, red blood cells, and urine.

==Signs and symptoms==

Though expressivity is varied depending on the mutation responsible for decrease in enzyme function, severe cutaneous sensitivity is present in most cases of this Porphyria. An estimated 30–40% of cases are due to the C73R mutation, which decreases stability of the enzyme and results in &lt;1% of its activity. Exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light causes the affected skin to thicken and produce vesicles that are prone to rupture and infection; these secondary infections, along with bone resorption, can lead to disfigurement of the sun-exposed face and extremities.
Enzyme dysfunction prevents the normal production of heme and hemolytic anemia is another common symptom, though a lack of hemolysis in this disease is possible. Porphyrins additionally accumulate in the bone and teeth, resulting in erythrodontia.
When unexpected attacks occur, abdominal pain, as well as vomiting and constipation commonly follow the attacks. Exposure to the sunlight can cause discomfort and result in blistering, consciousness of heat, and swelling and redness of the skin.

===Complications===
Photomutilation and transfusion-dependent anemia are common complications. Liver disease is also observed in some cases. It has been reported that early childhood-onset haematological manifestations is a poor prognosis factor.

== Causes ==
Gunther disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), located at human chromosome 10q25.2-q26.3. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene is responsible for the disorder and is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. When there is a homozygous mutation it causes a uroporphyrinogen III synthase and uroporphyrinogen cosynthase defect. When the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase is reacting normally it results in the making of isomer III porphyrinogen, which is what is used to form heme. When isomer III porphyrinogen is not produced because of a poor production of uroporphyrinogen III synthase then isomer I porphyrinogen is made which will oxidize and give a reddish tint skin.

==Diagnosis==
When diagnosing Congenital Erythroipoetic Porphyria (Gunther Disease) one must exclude other forms of porphyria. These include Hepatoerythropoietic Porphyria and rare homozygous variants of Variegate Porphyria, Hereditary Coproporphyria, and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI). Mild variants may be present similarly to Porphyria Cutanea Tarda. 

There are four steps in establishing the diagnosis of any porphyria. First, a thorough history (particularly family history) and physical exam are performed with special attention paid to sun-exposed skin. Biochemical measurements of porphyrins and precursors in the urine, feces, and blood are necessary. Specialized labs are helpful in measuring activity of specific enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway and/or DNA and mutational analyses. In CEP, activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway) will be markedly decreased. 

In congenital erythropoietic porphyria, urine aminolavulanic acid and porphobilinogen are typically normal. However, uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin tend to be markedly elevated and moderately elevated, respectively, in the urine more than in the feces. Additionally, fecal protoporphyrin is typically mildly elevated.

In the red blood cells, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin are all elevated, distinguishing this form of porphyria from the others. Finally, plasma analysis will demonstrate elevated uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. 

Other nonspecific but helpful diagnostic clues are history of cutaneous photosensitivity, blistering, erosions, crusts and ulcerations leading to extensive scarring and deformation of the hands, loss of eyebrows, eyelashes with severe mutilation of cartilaginous structures like the nose, erythrodontia, and variable degree of hematologic involvement ranging from mild hemolytic anemia to intrauterine hydrops fetalis. Other early clues are red or violet staining of diapers.

== Treatment ==
There are multiple ways to treat Gunther&#x27;s diseases, but one of the most crucial things that a person with this disease can do is limit themselves from sun exposure or eliminate sun exposure altogether. There are some sunscreens that have undesirable effects such as tropical sunscreens, but other sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are shown to provide protection due to those light-reflective agents. To block the ultraviolet and visible light wavelengths and get the protection that patients with Gunther&#x27;s disease require, physical barriers are needed. It is also advised that patients wear protective clothing to block the sun from their skin. Plastic films can be attached to car windows and homes to filter out some of the wavelengths that could cause harm to someone&#x27;s skin with this disease. Incandescent bulbs replace the normal fluorescent lamps. These bulbs release less light, which prevents the &quot;porphyrin-exciting&quot; wavelengths that fluorescent lights emit.

Other less beneficial treatments have been used to help treat Gunther&#x27;s disease. These include oral beta-carotene and other treatments such as activated charcoal and cholestyramine, which are used to interrupt and stop the porphyrins from being reabsorbed in the body. The reason that these oral treatments are unreasonable is because they require an extremely large dose of medicine and therefore are not beneficial.

Erythrocyte transfusions have been shown to be a successful measure in decreasing the appearance of the disease by trying to lower the erythropoiesis and circulating porphyrin levels. Unfortunately, having chronic erythrocyte transfusions can be extremely harmful to the body and can cause severe complications.

To help with dry eye symptoms and visual function, topical lubrication can be used.
A more invasive way to help treat Gunther&#x27;s disease would be to have surgery. There have been numerous studies that have stated that bone marrow transplantation is successful. This is a recently new development for Gunther&#x27;s disease so the long-term effects are still unresourced. If a patient has a life-threatening infectious complication then bone marrow transplantation is no longer relevant for them.
There are also reports that stem cell transplantation is successful in a limited number of participants

== Eponym ==
The disorder is named after the German physician who discovered it, Hans Günther (1884–1956).

<doc id="1123733" wikidata="Q639203" url="?curid=1123733" title="Menkes disease">
<text>Menkes disease (MNK), also known as Menkes syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in genes coding for the copper-transport protein ATP7A, leading to copper deficiency. Characteristic findings include kinky hair, growth failure, and nervous system deterioration. Like all X-linked recessive conditions, Menkes disease is more common in males than in females. The disorder was first described by John Hans Menkes in 1962.
Onset occurs during infancy, with incidence of about 1 in 100,000 to 250,000 newborns; affected infants often do not live past the age of three years, though there are rare cases in which less severe symptoms emerge later in childhood.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Affected infants may be born prematurely. Signs of the disease appear during infancy, typically after a two- to three-month period of normal or slightly slowed development that is followed by a loss of early developmental skills and subsequent developmental delay. Patients exhibit hypotonia (weak muscle tone), failure to thrive, hypothermia (subnormal body temperature), sagging facial features, seizures, and metaphyseal widening. Hair appears strikingly peculiar: kinky, colorless or silvery, and brittle. There can be extensive neurodegeneration in the gray matter of the brain. Arteries in the brain can also be twisted with frayed and split inner walls. This can lead to rupture or blockage of the arteries. Weakened bones (osteoporosis) may result in fractures.

Occipital horn syndrome (sometimes called X-linked cutis laxa or Ehlers-Danlos type 9) is a mild form of Menkes syndrome that begins in early to middle childhood. It is characterized by calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose skin and joints.

==Cause==
Mutations in the &quot;ATP7A&quot; gene, located on chromosome Xq21.1, lead to Menkes syndrome. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. About 30% of MNK cases are due to new mutations and 70% are inherited, almost always from the mother. Even though the disease is more common in males, females can still be a carrier of the disease. As the result of a mutation in the &quot;ATP7A&quot; gene, copper is poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels and the nervous system such as lysyl oxidase. As with other X-linked disorders, female children of a carrier mother have an even chance of carrying the disorder, but are normally well; male children have an even chance of having the disorder or of being free from it. A genetic counselor may have useful advice.

==Mechanism==

The ATP7A gene encodes a transmembrane protein that transport copper across the cell membranes. It is found throughout the body, except for the liver. In the small intestines, the ATP7A protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the protein travels between the Golgi apparatus and the cell membrane to maintain copper concentrations in the cell. The protein is normally found in the Golgi apparatus, which is important for modifying proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, ATP7A protein provides copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. One of the enzymes, lysyl oxidase, requires copper for proper function. This enzyme cross-links tropocollagen into strong collagen fibrils. The defective collagen contributes to many of the aforementioned connective tissue manifestations of this disease.

If copper levels become excessive, the protein will travel to the cell membrane and eliminate excess copper from the cell. Mutations in the ATP7A gene such as deletions and insertions lead to parts of the gene being deleted, resulting in a shortened ATP7A protein. This prevents the production of a functional ATP7A protein, leading to the impaired absorption of copper from food and copper will not be supplied to certain enzymes.

==Diagnosis==
Menkes syndrome can be diagnosed by blood tests of the copper and ceruloplasmin levels, skin biopsy, and optical microscopic examination of the hair to view characteristic Menkes abnormalities. X-rays of the skull and skeleton are conducted to look for abnormalities in bone formation. Urine homovanillic acid/vanillylmandelic acid ratio has been proposed as a screening tool to support earlier detection. Since 70% of MNK cases are inherited, genetic testing of the mother can be performed to search for a mutation in the ATP7A gene.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for Menkes disease. Early treatment with injections of copper supplements (acetate or glycinate) may be of some slight benefit. 11 of 12 newborns who were diagnosed with MNK were alive at age 4.6. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms includes pain medication, anti-seizure medication, feeding tube when necessary, and physical and occupational therapy. The earlier treatment is given, the better the prognosis.

==Epidemiology==
One European study reported a rate of 1 in 254,000; a Japanese study reported a rate of 1 in 357,143. No correlation with other inherited characteristics, or with ethnic origin, is known.

<text>Fabian Taylor (born 13 April 1980) is a former Jamaican soccer player, who formerly played as a striker for his last club, Harbour View.

==Club career==

=== Harbour View ===

Nicknamed &quot;Koji&quot;, Taylor began his Jamaica National Premier League career at Harbour View FC in 1999. He emerged as one of the top players in Jamaica, leading the league with 19 goals in a single season. After five years, he left the club and spent 2004 on loan with the MetroStars of Major League Soccer.

=== MetroStars ===

In his season with the MetroStars, Taylor had trouble finding playing time in a crowded front line; although he exhibited his scoring prowess very early in the season, he faded as the year passed, ending the season with only five goals and one assist in 21 games played, only eight of which he started.

=== Harbour View ===

Back at Harbour View, he was scoring goals again, finishing 2006–07 season as third in the goalscoring charts with 15 goals.

=== Notodden ===

In March 2008, he signed a three-year contract with Norwegian club Notodden FK. He missed half of the 2009 Adeccoligaen season with a broken leg. Unfortunately the club was relegated at the end of the 2010 season. Taylor once again experience injury issues for Notodden FK in 2010, while the club finish second in the domestic league and failed to earn promotion to the Adeccoligaen for 2011.

=== Harbour View ===
In February 2011, Taylor made his return to Harbour View against Boys Town FC.

==International career==
Taylor has been an important role player for the Jamaica national team, playing 39 games and scoring 7 goals since debuting with the team in 1999.

<doc id="1123738" wikidata="Q7973970" url="?curid=1123738" title="Waterfall railway station, Sydney">
<text>Waterfall railway station is located on the Illawarra line, serving the Sydney suburb of Waterfall. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T4 Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line services and NSW TrainLink&#x27;s South Coast Line services.

==History==
The station opened on 9 March 1886 as Waterfalls, being renamed later in the year. It served as the line&#x27;s terminus until it was extended to Scarborough in 1887. When the line was duplicated from Hurstville on 12 December 1890, the station was relocated northwards. In 1897 a locomotive depot opened.

On 4 May 1905 the station moved 600 metres north to its present location.

On 20 December 1994, a shunting accident involving two empty S sets saw one train jack-knife onto the platform, demolishing the concrete pedestrian bridge.

The original weatherboard building was demolished in 1995 and replaced by a rendered brick building.

South of Waterfall railway station is the site of the Waterfall train disaster, a rail accident that claimed the lives of the driver and six passengers on 31 January 2003.

Work commenced in late 2013 to make the station fully wheelchair accessible.

==Sidings==
Waterfall has sidings for staging freight trains in either direction and a bypass track for goods trains on either side of the platforms. There are also three sidings for the stabling of suburban electric trains to the east of the station. If both platforms at Waterfall station are occupied, then trains that do not stop at Waterfall will also pass by on the bypass tracks.

<text>Rodrigo Faria (born 24 February 1977, in Rio de Janeiro) is a former Brazilian footballer who played as a striker.

==Early career==
Faria began his youth career in Brazil with the Flamengo and Vasco da Gama systems. He later came to the United States to attend Concordia College in 1999, where he scored 24 goals in 19 games. During college, he also played for the Westchester Flames in the Premier Development League. He was scouted by the MetroStars and subsequently drafted 13th overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft.

==Professional career==
In his first season with the MetroStars, Faria tied the then MLS rookie single-season record by scoring eight goals on the way to being named the MLS Rookie of the Year. In an expanded role in 2002, he upped his total to twelve goals and also tallied five assists to lead the club in scoring. The club acquired a new head coach Bob Bradley from the Chicago Fire the following season and Faria was shipped to Chicago as compensation.

Rodrigo split the 2003 MLS season between the Fire and the San Jose Earthquakes, without scoring a regular season goal. He scored the overtime game-winner for the Earthquakes in a dramatic comeback against the Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS Cup semifinals. San Jose went on to win the Cup with Faria playing a minor role.

Shortly after the 2003 season, Faria returned to Brazil to tend to his family&#x27;s business interests after the death of his father. Though he expressed interest in continuing his playing career, he retired from the game due to a lack of Brazilian clubs willing to pay the required fees to purchase his unfulfilled contract with MLS.

<text>Urethral meatal stenosis is a narrowing (stenosis) of the opening of the urethra at the external meatus , thus constricting the opening through which urine leaves the body from the urinary bladder.

==Symptoms and signs==
* Visible narrow opening at the meatus in boys
* Irritation, scarring or swelling of the meatus in boys
* Abnormal strength and direction of urinary stream
* Discomfort with urination (dysuria and frequency)
* Incontinence (day or night)
* Bleeding (hematuria) at end of urination
* Urinary tract infections - increased susceptibility due to stricture

==Causes==

The protection provided by the foreskin for the glans penis and meatus has been recognized since 1915. In the absence of the foreskin the meatus is exposed to mechanical and chemical irritation from ammoniacal diaper (nappy) that produces blister formation and ulceration of the urethral opening, which eventually gives rise to meatal stenosis (a narrowing of the opening). Meatal stenosis may also be caused by ischemia resulting from damage to the frenular artery during circumcision.

==Risk factors==

Frisch &amp; Simonsen (2016) carried out a very large-scale study in Denmark, which compared the incidence of meatal stenosis in Muslim males (mostly circumcised) with the incidence of meatal stenosis in ethnic Danish males (mostly non-circumcised). The risk of meatal stenosis in circumcised males was found to be as much 3.7 times higher than in the non-circumcised males.

==Diagnosis==

In males, history and physical exam is adequate to make the diagnosis. In females, VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram) is usually diagnostic. Other tests may include:
* Urine analysis
* Urine culture
* CBC, basic metabolic panel
* Renal and bladder ultrasound

==Prevention==

===In the newborn===

According to Frisch &amp; Simonsen (2016), &quot;the foreskin is protective against urinary stricture disease&quot; (meatal stenosis). Frisch &amp; Simonsen (2016) call for a &quot;thorough reassessment of the burden of urethral troubles and other adverse outcomes after non-therapeutic circumcision of boys.&quot;

===After hypospadias repair===

Meir &amp; Livne (2004) suggest that use of a broad spectrum antibiotic after hypospadias repair will &quot;probably reduce meatal stenosis [rates]&quot;, while Jayanthi (2003) recommends the use of a modified Snodgrass hypospadias repair.

==Treatment==
In females, meatal stenosis can usually be treated in the physician&#x27;s office using local anesthesia to numb the area and dilating (widening) the urethral opening with special instruments.

In males, it is treated by a second surgical procedure called meatotomy in which the meatus is crushed with a straight mosquito hemostat and then divided with fine-tipped scissors. Recently, home-dilatation has been shown to be a successful treatment for most boys.

==Prognosis==

Most people can expect normal urination after treatment.

==Incidence==

Numerous studies over a long period of time clearly indicate that male circumcision contributes to the development of urethral stricture. Among circumcised males, reported incidence of meatal stricture varies. Griffiths &quot;et al&quot;. (1985) reported an incidence of 2.8 percent. Sörensen &amp; Sörensen (1988) reported 0 percent. Cathcart &quot;et al&quot;. (2006) reported an incidence of 0.55 percent. Yegane &quot;et al&quot;. (2006) reported an incidence of 0.9 percent. Van Howe (2006) reported an incidence of 7.29 percent. In Van Howe&#x27;s study, all cases of meatal stenosis were among circumcised boys. Simforoosh &quot;et al&quot;. (2010) reported an incidence of 0.55 percent. According to Emedicine (2016), the incidence of meatal stenosis runs from 9 to 20 percent. Frisch &amp; Simonsen (2016) placed the incidence at 5 to 20 percent of circumcised boys.

<text>Gholam Serwar Nasher (also known as Ghulam Sarwar Nashir; 1922–1984) was the last ruling Khan of the Nashir and President of Spinzar Cotton Company in Kunduz, the most profitable company and one of the largest companies in pre-war Afghanistan.

== Life ==

Nashir was born in Qarabagh, Afghanistan to Mohammad Alam Khan Nasher, brother to Sher Khan Nasher, to an ethnic Pashtun Ghilzai family of Khans.

Nashir led the Spinzar Cotton Company in Kunduz, exporting cotton overseas, producing cotton seed oil, soap and porcelain. He built hotels under the Spinzar brand in Kunduz, Kabul and other northern cities, employing over 20,000 people including woman working in the porcelain factory. He opened factories in the north, providing free housing for the employees, hospital, the only girls school in the city of Kunduz, sport clubs, and hotels. Nashir founded the &quot;Nashir Library and Museum&quot;. 

During his khanat, Kunduz become the richest province of the pre-war country, Spinzar being Afghanistan&#x27;s most profitable company.

Nashir was awarded &quot;The Order of the Golden House&quot; by King Zahir Shah and &quot;The Order of the Sacred Treasure&quot; by the Emperor of Japan, in 1971.

==Death==
He died in exile in Germany in 1984 at the age of 62. He was survived by two wives, nine children and eight grandchildren.

=== Discovery of Ai-Khanoum ===
On a hunting trip, Nashir discovered ancient artefacts of Ai Khanom and invited Princeton-archaeologist Daniel Schlumberger with his team to examine Ai-Khanoum. It was soon found to be a major city of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom and was extensively studied before the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan War in 1979, during which it was comprehensively looted. Artefacts from the ruins have been exhibited worldwide.

<doc id="1123761" wikidata="Q965041" url="?curid=1123761" title="Slit lamp">
<text>In ophthalmology and optometry, a slit lamp is an instrument consisting of a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine a thin sheet of light into the eye. It is used in conjunction with a biomicroscope. The lamp facilitates an examination of the anterior segment and posterior segment of the human eye, which includes the eyelid, sclera, conjunctiva, iris, natural crystalline lens, and cornea. The binocular slit-lamp examination provides a stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in detail, enabling anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions. A second, hand-held lens is used to examine the retina.

==History==
Two conflicting trends emerged in the development of the slit lamp. One trend originated from clinical research and aimed to apply the increasingly complex and advanced technology of the time. The second trend originated from ophthalmologic practice and aimed at technical perfection and a restriction to useful methods. The first man credited with developments in this field was Hermann von Helmholtz (1850) when he invented the ophthalmoscope.

In ophthalmology and optometry, the instrument is called a &quot;slit lamp&quot;, although it is more correctly called a &quot;slit lamp instrument&quot;. Today&#x27;s instrument is a combination of two separate developments, the corneal microscope and the slit lamp itself. The first concept of a slit lamp dates back to 1911 credited to Allvar Gullstrand and his &quot;large reflection-free ophthalmoscope.&quot; The instrument was manufactured by Zeiss and consisted of a special illuminator connected to a small stand base through a vertical adjustable column. The base was able to move freely on a glass plate. The illuminator employed a Nernst glower which was later converted into a slit through a simple optical system. However, the instrument never received much attention and the term &quot;slit lamp&quot; did not appear in any literature again until 1914.

It was not until 1919 that several improvements were made to the Gullstrand slit lamp made by Vogt Henker. First, a mechanical connection was made between lamp and ophthalmoscopic lens. This illumination unit was mounted to the table column with a double articulated arm. The binocular microscope was supported on a small stand and could be moved freely across the tabletop. Later, a cross slide stage was used for this purpose. Vogt introduced Koehler illumination, and the reddish Nernst glower was replaced with the brighter and whiter incandescent lamp. Special mention should be paid to the experiments that followed Henker&#x27;s improvements in 1919. On his improvements the Nitra lamp was replaced with a carbon arc lamp with a liquid filter. At this time the great importance of color temperature and the luminance of the light source for slit lamp examinations were recognized and the basis created for examinations in red-free light.

In the year 1926, the slit lamp instrument was redesigned. The vertical arrangement of the projector made it easy to handle. For the first time, the axis through the patient&#x27;s eye was fixed along a common swiveling axis, although the instrument still lacked a coordinate cross-slide stage for instrument adjustment. The importance of focal illumination had not yet been fully recognized.

In 1927, stereo cameras were developed and added to the slit lamp to further its use and application. In 1930, Rudolf Theil further developed the slit lamp, encouraged by Hans Goldmann. Horizontal and vertical co-ordinate adjustments were performed with three control elements on the cross-slide stage. The common swivel axis for microscope and illumination system was connected to the cross-slide stage, which allowed it to be brought to any part of the eye to be examined. A further improvement was made in 1938. A control lever or joystick was used for the first time to allow for horizontal movement.

Following World War II the slit lamp was improved again. On this particular improvement the slit projector could be swiveled continuously across the front of the microscope. This was improved again in 1950, when a company named Littmann redesigned the slit lamp. They adopted the joystick control from the Goldmann instrument and the illumination path present in the Comberg instrument. Additionally, Littmann added the stereo telescope system with a common objective magnification changer.

In 1965, the Model 100/16 Slit Lamp was produced based on the slit lamp by Littmann. This was soon followed by the Model 125/16 Slit Lamp in 1972. The only difference between the two models was their operating distances of 100 mm to 125 mm. With the introduction of the photo slit lamp further advancements were possible. In 1976, the development of the Model 110 Slit Lamp and the 210/211 Photo Slit Lamps were an innovation by which each were constructed from standard modules allowing for a wide range of different configurations. At the same time, halogen lamps replaced the older illumination systems to make them brighter and essentially daylight quality. From 1994 onwards, new slit lamps were introduced which took advantage of new technologies. The last major development was in 1996 in which included new slit lamp optics. See also &quot;From Lateral Illumination to Slit Lamp - An Outline of Medical History&quot;.

==General procedure==
While a patient is seated in the examination chair, they rest their chin and forehead on a support area to steady the head. Using the biomicroscope, the ophthalmologist or optometrist then proceeds to examine the patient&#x27;s eye. A fine strip of paper, stained with fluorescein, a fluorescent dye, may be touched to the side of the eye; this stains the tear film on the surface of the eye to aid examination. The dye is naturally rinsed out of the eye by tears.

A subsequent test may involve placing drops in the eye in order to dilate the pupils. The drops take about 15 to 20 minutes to work, after which the examination is repeated, allowing the back of the eye to be examined. Patients will experience some light sensitivity for a few hours after this exam, and the dilating drops may also cause increased pressure in the eye, leading to nausea and pain. Patients who experience serious symptoms are advised to seek medical attention immediately.

Adults need no special preparation for the test; however children may need some preparation, depending on age, previous experiences, and level of trust.

== Illuminations ==
Various methods of slitlamp illumination are required to obtain full advantage of slit-lamp biomicroscope. There are mainly six type of illuminating options:
# Diffuse illumination,
# Direct focal illumination,
# Specular reflection,
# Transillumination or retroillumination,
# Indirect lateral illumination or Indirect proximal illumination and
# Sclerotic scatter.
Oscillatory Illumination is sometimes considered an illumination technique.
Observation with an optical section or direct focal illumination is the most frequently applied method of examination with the slit lamp. With this method, the axes of illuminating and viewing path intersect in the area of the anterior eye media to be examined, for example, the individual corneal layers.

=== Diffuse illumination ===

If media, especially that of the cornea, are opaque, optical section images are often impossible depending on severity. In these cases, diffuse illumination may be used to advantage. For this, the slit is opened very wide and a diffuse, attenuated survey illumination is produced by inserting a ground glass screen or diffuser in the illuminating path. &quot;Wide beam&quot; illumination is the only type that has the light source set wide open. Its main purpose is to illuminate as much of the eye and its adnexa at once for general observation.

=== Direct focal illumination ===

Observation with an optical section or direct focal illumination is the most frequently applied method. It is achieved by directing a full-height, hairline to medium width, medium-bright beam obliquely into the eye and focusing it on the cornea so that a quadrilateral block of light illuminates the transparent medias of eye. Viewing arm and illuminating arm are kept parfocal. This type of illumination is useful for depth localization. Direct focal illumination is used for grading cells and flare in anterior chamber by shortening height of beam to 2–1 mm.

=== Specular reflection ===
Specular reflection, or reflected illumination is just like patches of reflection seen on sunlit lake water surface. To achieve specular reflection, the examiner directs a medium to narrow beam of light (it must be thicker than an optical section) toward the eye from the temporal side. The angle of illumination should be wide (50°-60°) relative to the examiners axis of observation
(which should be slightly nasal to the patients visual axis). A bright zone of specular reflection will be evident on the temporal, midperipheral corneal epithelium. It is used to see endothelial outline of cornea.

=== Transillumination or retroillumination ===

In certain cases, illumination by optical section does not yield sufficient information or is impossible. This is the case, for example, when larger, extensive zones or spaces of the ocular media are opaque. Then the scattered light that is not very bright normally is absorbed. A similar situation arises when areas behind the crystalline lens are to be observed. In this case the observation beam must pass a number of interfaces that may reflect and attenuate the light.

=== Indirect illumination ===

With this method, light enters the eye through a narrow to medium slit (2 to 4 mm) to one side of the area to be examined. The axes of illuminating and viewing path do not intersect at the point of image focus, to achieve this; the illuminating prism is decentered by rotating it about its vertical axis off the normal position. In this way, reflected, indirect light illuminates the area of the anterior chamber or cornea to be examined. The observed corneal area then lies between the incident light section through the cornea and the irradiated area of the iris. Observation is thus against a comparatively dark background.

=== Sclerotic scatter or scattering sclero-corneal illumination ===

With this type of illumination, a wide light beam is directed onto the limbal region of the cornea at an extremely low angle of incidence and with a laterally de-centered illuminating prism. Adjustment must allow the light beam to transmit through the corneal parenchymal layers according to the principle of total reflection allowing the interface with the cornea to be brightly illuminated. The magnification should be selected so that the entire cornea can be seen at a glance.

==Special techniques==
=== Fundus observation and gonioscopy with the slit lamp ===

Fundus observation is generally performed via ophthalmoscopy, where the observer (fundus camera or observing eye) is focused to infinity, which brings the subject&#x27;s fundus into focus due to the refractive power of the subject&#x27;s optical media. In contrast, the microscope in slit lamp biomicroscopy is focused to the anterior segments of the eye, such that direct observation of the fundus is impossible due to the subject&#x27;s refractive power. However, with the use of auxiliary optics, the fundus can be brought within the focusing range of the microscope. These optics usually take the form of a lens placed on or near the subject&#x27;s cornea, which range in optical properties and practical application.

Watzke–Allen test is a test used in diagnosis of a full thickness macular hole and also to assess retinal function after surgical closure of the hole, with the help of slit lamp.

==Light filters==
Most slit-lamps have five light filters options:
# Unfiltered,
# Heat absorption- for increased patient comfort
# Grey filter,
# Red free- for better visualisation of nerve fibre layer and haemorrhages and blood vessels.
# Cobalt blue- after staining with fluorescein dye, for seeing corneal ulcers, contact lens fitting, Seidel&#x27;s test

===Cobalt blue light===
Slit lamps produce light of the wavelength 450 to 500 nm, known as &quot;cobalt blue&quot;. This light is specifically useful for looking for problems in the eye once it has been stained with fluorescein.

== Types ==
There are two distinct slit lamp types based on the location of their illumination system:

=== Zeiss type ===
In the Zeiss type slit lamp, the illumination is located below the microscope. This type of slit lamp is named after the manufacturing company Carl Zeiss.

=== Haag Streit type ===
In the Haag Streit type slit lamp, the illumination is located above the microscope. This type of slit lamp is named after the manufacturing company Haag Streit. 

==Interpretation==
The slit lamp exam may detect many diseases of the eye, including:
* Cataract
* Conjunctivitis
* Corneal injury such as corneal ulcer or corneal swelling
* Diabetic retinopathy
* Fuchs&#x27; dystrophy
* Keratoconus (Fleischer ring)
* Macular degeneration
* Retinal detachment
* Retinal vessel occlusion
* Retinitis pigmentosa
* Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome
* Toxoplasmosis
* Uveitis
* Wilson&#x27;s disease (Kayser–Fleischer ring)
A sign that may be seen in slit lamp examination is a &quot;flare&quot;, which is when the slit-lamp beam is visible in the anterior chamber. This occurs when there is breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier with resultant exudation of protein.

<text>Paul Andrew Stalteri (born October 18, 1977) is a Canadian former professional soccer player who played as a defender or midfielder. He spent most of his professional career in Germany, winning the league and cup double with Werder Bremen in the 2003–04 season. Stalteri also played football in the Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham.

A regular for the Canada national team, Stalteri made a national record 84 appearances at the senior level, scoring 7 goals. He was part of the squad that won the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2000.

He serves as an assistant coach for the Canada national team.

== Early life ==
Stalteri was born to an Italian father and a Guyanese mother. While growing up, Stalteri says his favourite player was Paolo Maldini and the first live football match he ever saw was Toronto Blizzard. He also considered Physical Education to be his favourite subject.

While playing youth soccer in Ontario with the Malton Bullets, won a Robbie International Soccer Tournament Championship.

== Club career ==
A defender who can play either side of the field as well as in midfield, Stalteri began his soccer career playing one year of college soccer at Clemson University in 1996. Following his first year, he elected to turn professional, signing a contract with the Toronto Lynx while attending York University. After playing one season with the Lynx, alongside fellow Canada national team teammate Dwayne De Rosario, where he led the team in scoring with eight goals and two assists, Stalteri was noticed by a scout from Werder Bremen and purchased from the team. After two and a half seasons in the reserves, Stalteri made his debut with the club in August 2000, scoring in the first game of the season against Energie Cottbus.

During the 2001–02 season, Stalteri established his role in the first team at Bremen and went on to cement his role as a regular in the 2002–03 season. In 2003–04, Werder Bremen won the Bundesliga.

In May 2005, Stalteri transferred to English Premiership club Tottenham Hotspur. He featured heavily in the 2005–06 campaign as Spurs narrowly missed out on a Champions League place, but the arrival of full back Pascal Chimbonda at White Hart Lane the following season limited his chances.

On March 4, 2007, after coming on as a substitute, he scored a dramatic last minute winner against London rivals West Ham United to complete an extraordinary 4–3 win. He had hardly featured in the first team all season up to that point. His other Spurs goals came against Manchester City in the league and Leicester City in the FA Cup.

On January 31, 2008, Stalteri moved to Fulham on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut for Fulham away at Middlesbrough on February 9, 2008 where his team lost 1–0. Having returned to White Hart Lane, his contract was terminated by mutual consent on December 21, 2008.

Stalteri returned to the Bundesliga, having been immediately signed by Borussia Mönchengladbach where he joined fellow international Rob Friend.

He announced his retirement as a player at the age of 35 on March 20, 2013.

== International career ==
Stalteri was a regular starter for the Canada national team for over ten years from making his debut on August 17, 1997 against Iran. In total, he won 84 caps and scored seven goals for the national team. That made him the most capped Canadian of all time until this record was surpassed by Julian De Guzman in 2015. He was named team captain for a friendly on June 1, 2007 against Venezuela, and remained captain for international fixtures for the rest of his international career including for the entirety of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup. On September 7, 2010 Stalteri earned his 83rd cap for Canada in a 2–1 win over Honduras making him the all-time leader in appearances for the Canada men&#x27;s national team.

In May 2017, Stalteri was inducted into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
In February 2020, Stalteri joined Canadian Premier League club York9 FC (later renamed York United) as an assistant coach. He departed the club after the 2021 season.

In January 2022, he joined Major League Soccer club Toronto FC as an assistant coach.

In October 2023, he joined the Canada national team as an assistant coach.

<doc id="1123769" wikidata="Q146139" url="?curid=1123769" title="Polyoxymethylene">
<text>Polyoxymethylene (POM), also known as acetal, polyacetal, and polyformaldehyde, is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability. Short-chained POM (chain length between 8 and 100 repeating units) is also better known as paraformaldehyde (PFA). As with many other synthetic polymers, polyoxymethylenes are produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold as Delrin, Kocetal, Ultraform, Celcon, Ramtal, Duracon, Kepital, Polypenco, Tenac and Hostaform.

POM is characterized by its high strength, hardness and rigidity to −40 °C. POM is intrinsically opaque white because of its high crystalline composition but can be produced in a variety of colors. POM has a density of 1.410–1.420g/cm3.

Typical applications for injection-molded POM include high-performance engineering components such as small gear wheels, eyeglass frames, ball bearings, ski bindings, fasteners, gun parts, knife handles, and lock systems. The material is widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industry. POM&#x27;s electrical resistivity is 14×1015 Ω⋅cm making it a dielectric with a 19.5MV/m breakdown voltage.

==Development==
Polyoxymethylene was discovered by Hermann Staudinger, a German chemist who received the 1953 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He had studied the polymerization and structure of POM in the 1920s while researching macromolecules, which he characterized as polymers. Due to problems with thermostability, POM was not commercialized at that time.

Circa 1952, research chemists at DuPont synthesized a version of POM, and in 1956 the company filed for patent protection of the homopolymer, forgetting to mention in the patent the term copolymer, opening thus the road to competitors. DuPont credits R. N. MacDonald as the inventor of high-molecular-weight POM. Patents by MacDonald and coworkers describe the preparation of high-molecular-weight hemiacetal-terminated (~O−CH2OH) POM, but these lack sufficient thermal stability to be commercially viable. The inventor of a heat-stable (and therefore useful) POM homopolymer was Stephen Dal Nogare, who discovered that reacting the hemiacetal ends with acetic anhydride converts the readily depolymerizable hemiacetal into a thermally stable, melt-processable plastic.

In 1960, DuPont completed construction of a plant to produce its own version of acetal resin, named &quot;Delrin&quot;, at Parkersburg, United States. Also in 1960, Celanese completed its own research. Shortly thereafter, in a limited partnership with the Frankfurt firm Hoechst AG, a factory was built in Kelsterbach, Hessen; from there, &quot;Celcon&quot; was produced starting in 1962, with &quot;Hostaform&quot; joining it a year later. Both remain in production under the auspices of Celanese and are sold as parts of a product group now called &#x27;Hostaform/Celcon POM&quot;.

== Production ==
Different manufacturing processes are used to produce the homopolymer and copolymer versions of POM.

=== Homopolymer ===
To make polyoxymethylene homopolymer, anhydrous formaldehyde must be generated. The principal method is by reaction of the aqueous formaldehyde with an alcohol to create a hemiformal, dehydration of the hemiformal/water mixture (either by extraction or vacuum distillation) and release of the formaldehyde by heating the hemiformal. The formaldehyde is then polymerized by anionic catalysis, and the resulting polymer stabilized by reaction with acetic anhydride. Due to the manufacturing process, large-diameter cross-sections may have pronounced centerline porosity. A typical example is DuPont&#x27;s Delrin.

===Copolymer ===
The polyoxymethylene copolymer replaces about 1–1.5% of the −CH2O− groups with −CH2CH2O−.

To make polyoxymethylene copolymer, formaldehyde is generally converted to trioxane (specifically 1,3,5-trioxane, also known as trioxin). This is done by acid catalysis (either sulfuric acid or acidic ion-exchange resins) followed by purification of the trioxane by distillation and/or extraction to remove water and other active hydrogen-containing impurities. Typical copolymers are Hostaform from Celanese and Ultraform from BASF.

The co-monomer is typically dioxolane, but ethylene oxide can also be used. Dioxolane is formed by reaction of ethylene glycol with aqueous formaldehyde over an acid catalyst. Other diols can also be used.

Trioxane and dioxolane are polymerized using an acid catalyst, often boron trifluoride etherate, BF3OEt2. The polymerization can take place in a non-polar solvent (in which case the polymer forms as a slurry) or in neat trioxane (e.g. in an extruder). After polymerization, the acidic catalyst must be deactivated and the polymer stabilized by melt or solution hydrolysis to remove unstable end groups.

Stable polymer is melt-compounded, adding thermal and oxidative stabilizers and optionally lubricants and miscellaneous fillers.

=== Fabrication ===
POM is supplied in a granulated form and can be formed into the desired shape by applying heat and pressure. The two most common forming methods employed are injection molding and extrusion. Rotational molding and blow molding are also possible.

Typical applications for injection-molded POM include high-performance engineering components (e.g. gear wheels, ski bindings, yoyos, fasteners, lock systems). The material is widely used in the automotive and consumer electronics industry. There are special grades that offer higher mechanical toughness, stiffness or low-friction/wear properties.

POM is commonly extruded as continuous lengths of round or rectangular section. These sections can be cut to length and sold as bar or sheet stock for machining.

== Typical mechanical properties ==
POM is a hard plastic, that cannot be glued, but can be joined to POM by melting. Melted POM does not adhere to steel tools used to shape it.
POM is a relatively strong plastic, nearly as strong as epoxy, or aluminum, but a bit more flexible:
POM is wear-resistant:
== Availability and price ==
POM materials can have trademarked producer-specific names, for example &quot;Delrin&quot;.

Prices for large quantities, in October 2023, in US$/kg:

*   USA : 3.26, Europe 2.81, China 2.58, SEA 2.30, Middle East 1.68 .

Prices and availability retail / small wholesale :

*   available in many colors, e.g. black, white, but not transparent .
*   available as plates [ref], up to 3 meter by 1.25 meter, in thicknesses from 0.5mm to 130mm .
*   available as round bars [ref], from diameter 5mm to 200mm.

Retail price November 2023 in the Netherlands : from 19 to 27 euro/dm3

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
POM is a strong and hard plastic, about as strong as plastics can be, and therefore competes with e.g. epoxy resins and polycarbonates.

The price of POM is about the same as that of epoxy.

There are two main differences between POM and epoxy resins:

* epoxy is a two-component resin that can be cast, and adheres to everything it touches,

while POM can be cast when melted and adheres to practically nothing.

* epoxy is usable up to 180 °C. POM can be used long-time up to 80 °C, short-time up to 100 °C.

Epoxy resins are often used with glass fiber reinforcement, but for POM that is not an option because it does not adhere to the glass fibres.

Epoxy resins needs time to cure, while POM has fully matured as soon as it has cooled down.

POM has very little shrinkage: from 165 °C to 20 °C it shrinks by just 0.17%.

== Machining ==
When supplied as extruded bar or sheet, POM may be machined using traditional methods such as turning, milling, drilling etc. These techniques are best employed where production economics do not merit the expense of melt processing. The material is free-cutting, but does require sharp tools with a high clearance angle. The use of soluble cutting lubricant is not necessary, but is recommended.

POM sheets can be cut cleanly and accurately using an infrared laser, such as in a CO2 laser cutter.

Because the material lacks the rigidity of most metals, care should be taken to use light clamping forces and sufficient support for the work piece.

As can be the case with many polymers, machined POM can be dimensionally unstable, especially with parts that have large variations in wall thicknesses. It is recommended that such features be &quot;designed-out&quot; e.g. by adding fillets or strengthening ribs. Annealing of pre-machined parts before final finishing is an alternative. A rule of thumb is that in general, small components machined in POM suffer from less warping.

== Bonding ==
POM is typically very difficult to bond, with the copolymer typically responding worse to conventional adhesives than the homopolymer. Special processes and treatments have been developed to improve bonding. Typically these processes involve surface etching, flame treatment, using a specific primer/adhesive system, or mechanical abrasion.

Typical etching processes involve chromic acid at elevated temperatures. DuPont uses a patented process for treating acetal homopolymer called satinizing that creates a surface roughness sufficient for micromechanical interlocking. There are also processes involving oxygen plasma and corona discharge. In order to get a high bond strength without specialized tools, treatments, or roughening, one can use Loctite 401 prism adhesive combined with Loctite 770 prism primer to get bond strengths of ~1700psi.

Once the surface is prepared, a number of adhesives can be used for bonding. These include epoxies, polyurethanes, and cyanoacrylates. Epoxies have shown shear strength. Cyanoacrylates are useful for bonding to metal, leather, rubber, cotton, and other plastics.

Solvent welding is typically unsuccessful on acetal polymers, due to the excellent solvent resistance of acetal.

Thermal welding through various methods has been used successfully on both homopolymer and copolymer.

== Usage ==
* Mechanical gears, sliding and guiding elements, housing parts, springs, chains, screws, nuts, fan wheels, pump parts, valve bodies.
* Electrical engineering: insulators, bobbins, connectors, parts for electronic devices such as televisions, telephones, etc.
* Vehicle: fuel sender unit, light/control stalk/combination switch (including shifter for light, turn signal), power windows, door lock systems, articulated shells.
* Model: model railway parts, such as trucks (bogies) and hand rails (handle bars). POM is tougher than ABS, comes in bright translucent colors, and is not paintable.
* Hobbies: radio-controlled helicopter main gear, landing skid, yo-yos, vaping drip tips, 3D printer wheels, K&#x27;Nex, ball-jointed dolls, etc.
* Medical: insulin pen, metered dose inhalers (MDI).
* Food industry: Food and Drug Administration has approved some grades of POM for milk pumps, coffee spigots, filter housings and food conveyors.
* Furniture: hardware, locks, handles, hinges., rollers for sliding mechanisms of furnitures
* Construction: structural glass - pod holder for point
* Packaging: aerosol cans, vehicle tanks.
* Pens: used as the material for pen bodies and caps
* Sports: paintball accessories. It is often used for machined parts of paintball markers that do not require the strength of aluminium, such as handles and reciprocating bolts. POM is also used in airsoft guns to reduce piston noise.
* Longboarding: puck material for slide gloves help the rider touch the road and lean on their hand to slow down, stop, or perform tricks.
* Clothing: zippers.
* Music: picks, Irish flutes, bagpipes, practice chanters, harpsichord plectra, instrument mouthpieces, tips of some drum sticks.
* Dining: fully automatic coffee brewers; knife handles (particularly folding knives).
* Horology: mechanical movement parts (e.g. Lemania 5100), watch bracelets (e.g. IWC Porsche Design 3701).
* Vapor/e-cigarette accessories: material used in the manufacturing of most &quot;Drip Tips&quot; (Mouthpiece).
* Tobacco products: The BIC Group uses Delrin for their lighters.
*Keyboard keycaps: Cherry uses POM for their G80 and G81 series keyboards.

== Degradation ==

Acetal resins are sensitive to acid hydrolysis and oxidation by agents such as mineral acid and chlorine. POM homopolymer is also susceptible to alkaline attack and is more susceptible to degradation in hot water. Thus low levels of chlorine in potable water supplies (1–3 ppm) can be sufficient to cause environmental stress cracking, a problem experienced in both the US and Europe in domestic and commercial water supply systems. Defective mouldings are most sensitive to cracking, but normal mouldings can succumb if the water is hot. Both POM homopolymer and copolymer are stabilized to mitigate these types of degradation.

In chemistry applications, although the polymer is often suitable for the majority of glassware work, it can succumb to catastrophic failure. An example of this would be using the polymer clips on hot areas of the glassware (such as a flask-to-column, column-to-head or head-to-condenser joint during distillation). As the polymer is sensitive to both chlorine and acid hydrolysis, it may perform very poorly when exposed to the reactive gases, particularly hydrogen chloride (HCl). Failures in this latter instance can occur with seemingly unimportant exposures from well sealed joints and do so without warning and rapidly (the component will split or fall apart). This can be a significant health hazard, as the glass may open or smash. Here, PTFE or a high-grade stainless steel may be a more appropriate choice.

In addition, POM can have undesirable characteristics when burned. The flame is not self-extinguishing, shows little to no smoke, and the blue flame can be almost invisible in ambient light. Burning also releases formaldehyde gas, which irritates nose, throat, and eye tissues.

<text>Ōkārito Lagoon is a coastal lagoon on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is located south of Hokitika, and covers an area of about , making it the largest unmodified coastal wetland in New Zealand. It preserves a sequence of vegetation types from mature rimu forest through mānuka scrub to brackish water that has been lost in much of the rest of the West Coast. The settlement of Ōkārito is at the southern end of the lagoon.

== Name ==
The lagoon&#x27;s name is from the Māori , place of, and , the young shoots of the bulrush or raupō (&quot;Typha orientalis&quot;), a valued food source. Another account has Ōkārito taking its name from a rangatira named Kārito, whose daughters Mapourika and Wahapako gave their names to nearby Lake Mapourika and Lake Wahapo. The lagoon&#x27;s official name has been spelled with macrons over the vowels since 2010, although it is still commonly seen written as &quot;Okarito&quot;.

== Geography ==

The lagoon is in area, mostly quite shallow. It is the largest sandbar-built estuarine wetland in the West Coast region – and the largest such unmodified wetland in all New Zealand – and is roughly in the middle of a series of wetlands that extends for 40 km, between the Wanganui River in the north and the Waiho River in the south. Around the lagoon is a low moraine ridge left by a glacier 18,000 years ago as it retreated up what is now the Whataroa River.

Several small waterways drain into the lagoon, and it is the outflow of Lake Mapourika and Lake Wahapo via the Ōkārito River. At the southern end of the lagoon is the small settlement of Ōkārito. The lagoon is tidal, with large stretches of mudflat being exposed at low tide, when reliable passage for canoes is only possible along a main channel. The channel forks into several streams and creeks that can be used to enter tall coastal and rainforest. Most of the lagoon is trackless and muddy and only accessible by boat.
The lagoon is a dynamic system, driven by seismic activity along the main Alpine Fault. In an earthquake, the estuary floor settles and deepens, but sediment from landslides is also washed down from the mountains, forming a spit which partly blocks the lagoon off from the sea and raises the shoreline. Tides cannot penetrate as far, and a freshwater ecosystem forms, dominated by raupō around the water&#x27;s edge. Sediment is deposited at the river&#x27;s mouth as a delta. Over time, the arrival of sediment slows, the spit is breached and washed away, the water level lowers, and tides come further inland forming a brackish water ecosystem. During this stage Ōkārito&#x27;s rimu forest is able to encroach around the edges of the now-lower lagoon, a pattern we can observe today.

== Flora ==
Ōkārito Lagoon has extensive meadows of eelgrass (&quot;Zostera muelleri&quot;), one of the few such estuaries remaining in New Zealand; most have been wiped out by pollution and sedimentation after forest clearance. Eelgrass is not a seaweed, but a flowering plant that is pollinated underwater. Eelgrass beds are highly productive, not only drawing nutrients up out of the mud but providing a rich habitat for invertebrates and a nursery for baby fishes.

On the inland side of the lagoon are large stretches of saltmarsh and swampland, dominated by jointed wire rush or oioi (&quot;Apodasmia similis&quot;). This becomes a band of mānuka (&quot;Leptospermum scoparium&quot;), mingimingi (&quot;Coprosma propinqua&quot;), and flax (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) shrubland that transitions through kahikatea swamp forest into bush dominated by rimu and silver pine (&quot;Manoao colensoi&quot;). Ōkārito is one of the few places on the West Coast where the transition of tall rain forest through scrub and rush to brackish water can still be easily observed.

The transition zone can stretch quite a distance and contain saltmarsh ribbonwood (&quot;Plagianthus divaricatus&quot;), cabbage trees (&quot;Cordyline australis&quot;), and invasive gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;), gradually incorporating kahihatea, southern rātā, and kōwhai (&quot;Sophora microphylla&quot;) as salinity declines; or it can take place over just a few metres on the bank of a creek.

== Fauna ==
Over 70 bird species have been reported from Ōkārito Lagoon and the surrounding forest, including 40 species of shorebirds and migratory waders. Paradise shelducks, New Zealand scaup, black swans, and occasional grey ducks can be seen on the water. Black shags (&quot;Phalacrocorax carbo&quot;), little shags (&quot;P. melanoleucos&quot;), pied shags (&quot;P. varius&quot;), and spotted shags (&quot;Stictocarbo punctatus&quot;) all occur in the lagoon. Caspian terns (&quot;Hydroprogne caspia&quot;) and white-fronted terns (&quot;Sterna striata&quot;) are present, and most of the gulls are black-billed gulls (&quot;Chroicocephalus bulleri&quot;), the world&#x27;s most threatened gull species. As well as the common white-faced heron, one can see royal spoonbills and the famed white heron or kōtuku (&quot;Ardea alba modesta&quot;). Banded dotterels and variable oystercatchers breed on Ōkārito Beach.

Fernbirds are present all around the lagoon, and perhaps the best place in the world to see this secretive bird is amongst the oioi rushes on the Ōkārito Wetland Walk – this vegetation is not as good a hiding place as their usual scrub habitat. Pairs can be heard making a call-and-response &quot;u-tick&quot; call. Australasian bitterns and marsh crakes also inhabit the wetlands but are far harder to spot.

The juvenile fishes known as whitebait are common here, and so are whitebaiters during the September–mid-November season. The lagoon also contains longfin eels, flounder and yellow-eyed mullet. The mudflats are home to tunnelling crabs / papaka (&quot;Helice crassa&quot;), mudsnails / titiko (&quot;Amphibola crenata&quot;), and mudflat topshells (&quot;Diloma&quot; &quot;subrostratum&quot;). Flounder and shellfish populations are currently in good health.

=== Kōtuku ===

For many New Zealanders, Ōkārito is synonymous with the white heron (&quot;Ardea alba modesta&quot;), commonly referred to by its Māori name kōtuku, and known outside New Zealand as the Eastern great egret. This subspecies of great egret is quite common throughout Asia and Australia, but in New Zealand the white heron is extremely rare. When Queen Elizabeth II visited New Zealand in 1953–54, she was compared to the kōtuku – a compliment given to rare, distinguished visitors. The kōtuku is featured on the reverse side of a New Zealand $2 coin.

There is only one breeding site for White Heron in New Zealand: within the protected Waitangiroto Nature Reserve, north of Ōkārito Lagoon. Kōtuku share the colony with royal spoonbills, known as &quot;kōtuku ngutupapa&quot;. From this colony, kōtuku disperse throughout New Zealand, but return to this spot to breed. The first European to see the colony was surveyor Gerhard Mueller, who was guided there by Kere Tūtoko in 1865. There were only four nesting pairs of kōtuku in 1941 when the land at Waitangiroto was compulsorily acquired by the New Zealand government and gazetted as a nature reserve. The New Zealand population of kōtuku is around 180.

About 8–10 white herons are resident year-round at the Ōkārito Lagoon, and are most common seen between October and March. They can be observed relatively close up while kayaking on the lagoon, and regular birdwatching tours visit the colony from Whataroa.

== History ==
Māori occupation and seasonal harvesting in the area began over 600 years ago. Ōkārito was an important &quot;mahinga kai&quot; (food-gathering site) for Kāti Māhaki ki Makaawhio, a subtribe of Ngāi Tahu, who were collecting and working pounamu for trade. As part of the 1998 Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act, Ngāi Tahu were granted a &quot;nohoanga&quot; (seasonal gathering site) at the lagoon and statutory acknowledgment of their rights over it.

In the West Coast gold rush of the 1860s, Ōkārito rapidly grew to a population of several thousand, with 31 hotels, three banks, and a courthouse. The port was the third busiest on the West Coast after Hokitika and Greymouth, and had a wharf, customs house, and harbourmaster. At one point 500 prospective gold miners arrived in a single day. The harbourmaster directed ships over the treacherous bar with flags and signals. Flax and timber were exported from the wharf in the late 19th and early 20th century. Part of the wharf and its shed survive today; the shed was heavily reconstructed in 1960 using parts of the original wharf and shed, and now functions as an information centre. A large island in the lagoon was once the venue for sports days and horse racing, and also the site of Ōkārito&#x27;s first cemetery. One resident recalled:…the annual racing carnival was held on the island, and we children climbed on the gravestones to watch the race as it circled the hill and thundered down the straight for home and the winning post… on the evening of the racing carnival, a race ball was held and everyone from near and far attended.

== Conservation ==
Although it is New Zealand&#x27;s largest unmodified wetland, Ōkārito Lagoon is not yet protected under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, although several proposals have been made (the last in 2017). The lagoon has been made a mātaiti reserve with the support of local Makaawhio Māori, which allows for customary and recreational food gathering but not commercial harvesting. The area between Ōkārito Lagoon and the mountains is targeted by the $45 million Predator Free South Westland project, which aims to remove rats, stoats, and possums from 100,000 hectares.

<doc id="1123773" wikidata="Q6647667" url="?curid=1123773" title="Literary fiction">
<text>Literary fiction, mainstream fiction, non-genre fiction, serious fiction, high literature, artistic literature, and sometimes just literature, are labels that, in the book trade, refer to market novels that do not fit neatly into an established genre (see genre fiction) or, otherwise, refer to novels that are character-driven rather than plot-driven, examine the human condition, use language in an experimental or poetic fashion, or are simply considered serious art.

&quot;Literary fiction&quot; is often used as a synonym for literature, in the exclusive sense of writings specifically considered to have considerable artistic merit. Literary fiction is commonly regarded as artistically superior to genre fiction, the latter being a form of commercial fiction written to provide entertainment to a mass audience.

Some categories of literary fiction, such as historical fiction, magic realism, autobiographical novels, or encyclopedic novels, are sometimes termed &quot;genres&quot; without being considered genre fiction. Some authors are also seen as writing literary equivalents or precursors to established genres while still maintaining the division between commercial and literary fiction, such as the literary romance of Jane Austen or the speculative fiction of Margaret Atwood. Some critics and genre authors have posited even more significant overlap between literary and commercial fiction, citing major literary figures argued to have employed elements of popular genres, such as science fiction, crime fiction, and romance, to create works of literature. Slipstream genre is sometimes located between the genre and non-genre fictions.

==Characteristics==

=== Definition ===
Literary fiction may involve a concern with social commentary, political criticism, or reflection on the human condition. This contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern. It may have a slower pace than popular fiction. As Terrence Rafferty notes, &quot;Literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way.&quot; Other works may be more concerned with style and complexity of the writing: Saricks describes literary fiction as &quot;elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered&quot;.

As opposed to genre fiction, literary fiction refers to the realistic fiction of human character, or more broadly, &quot;all serious prose fiction outside the market genres&quot;, the genres being for example science fiction, fantasy, thrillers or Westerns. Jeff Prucher defined mainstream literature as &quot;realistic literature... that does not belong to a marketing category (especially science fiction, fantasy or horror)&quot;. 

James Gunn also noted the difference between commercial and literary mainstreams, with the former meaning authors whose works are popularhigh-selling bestsellersand the latter, works seen as &quot;art&quot;. He also noted that there is a contradiction between these, as &quot;high sales figures are generally taken to mean the author has sold out&quot; and left the literary mainstream. He further defined the literary mainstream as &quot;dominated by the academic-literary community—university professors of literature; high-powered critics for prestige publications such as the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: and writers who take the first two groups seriously&quot;. According to Gunn, the field of literary fiction in the United States is significantly framed by fiction of the early 20th century and classic canon made from works of authors such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce or Henry James (all of European descent).

=== Classic literature ===

Literary fiction includes classic books: that is works in any discipline that have been accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy. This includes being listed in a list of great books.

==== Europe ====
In English literary studies, the terms &quot;classic book&quot; and &quot;Western canon&quot; are closely related concepts, but they are not necessarily synonymous. A &quot;canon&quot; refers to a list of books considered to be &quot;essential&quot; and is presented in a variety of ways. It can be published as a collection, such as Great Books of the Western World, Modern Library, or Penguin Classics, or presented as a list by an academic such as Harold Bloom&#x27; or be the official reading list of an institution of higher learning.

Robert M. Hutchins in his 1952 preface to the &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; declared:

:Until lately the West has regarded it as self-evident that the road to education lay through great books. No man was educated unless he was acquainted with the masterpieces of his tradition. There never was very much doubt in anybody&#x27;s mind about which the masterpieces were. They were the books that had endured and that the common voice of mankind called the finest creations, in writing, of the Western mind.

Ben Bova, remarking on the distinction between genre and non-genre works, argued that &quot;the literature of the fantastic was the mainstream of world storytelling from the time writing began until the beginning of the seventeenth century&quot;, and that older classics have more in common with modern, fantastical genre works than with the genre of literary, mainstream fiction.

==== China ====
The Classic Chinese Novels are works of fiction noted for their immense impact on Chinese culture and literature.

=== High culture ===
Literary fiction can be considered an example of &quot;high culture&quot; and contrasted with &quot;popular culture&quot; and &quot;mass culture&quot;.

The poet and critic Matthew Arnold defined &quot;culture&quot;, in &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot; (1869), as &quot;the disinterested endeavour after man&#x27;s perfection&quot; pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to &quot;know the best that has been said and thought in the world&quot;. Such a literary definition of high culture also includes philosophy. The philosophy of aesthetics proposed high culture as a force for moral and political good.

=== Literary merit ===

Since 1901 the Nobel Prize in Literature has frequently been awarded to the authors of literary fiction. This annual award is presented to a writer from any country who has, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction. Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, the award is based on an author&#x27;s body of work as a whole.

The International Booker Prize is a similar British award given for outstanding literary fiction translated into English. This complements the earlier Booker Prize, which is awarded to fiction in the English language. For both judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and public figures. The Booker judging process and the very concept of a &quot;best book&quot; being chosen by a small number of literary insiders is controversial for many. Author Amit Chaudhuri wrote: &quot;The idea that a &#x27;book of the year&#x27; can be assessed annually by a bunch of people – judges who have to read almost a book a day – is absurd, as is the idea that this is any way of honouring a writer.&quot;

== Reactions ==
In an interview, John Updike lamented that &quot;the category of &#x27;literary fiction&#x27; has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier ... I&#x27;m a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit.&quot; Likewise, on &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because &quot;they are written in words.&quot;

James Gunn noted that genre fans and critics criticize mainstream literary fiction as mundane, with the term&#x27;s &quot;deliberate overtones of dullness, worldliness, and uninspired realism&quot;. He criticized mainstream literary fiction as becoming increasingly stagnant and marginalized. This view has been echoed by others; for example, British science fiction/fantasy writer Adam Roberts commented, &quot;It&#x27;s not that SFF [science fiction and fantasy] is a ghetto inside the glorious city of &#x27;Literary Fiction&#x27;, but the reverse. &#x27;Literary&#x27; novels sell abominably badly, by and large; popular culture in the main belongs to SF and Fantasy, eighteen of the top twenty highest grossing movies of all time are SFF, [and] everybody recognises SFF icons and memes&#x27;&quot;.

In the context of science fiction, Brian Stableford defined literary fiction as &quot;a tradition that had been and remained stubbornly indifferent to, if not proudly ignorant of, the progress of science&quot;. Gunn wrote, &quot;The SF community uses the word mainstream to describe the fiction that is getting the attention they want; the word is a confession that SF is felt to be a sidestream, a tributary.

Critics and readers of mainstream literary fiction have been accused of &quot;snobbery&quot; when it comes to their dislike of genre fiction.

<doc id="1123780" wikidata="Q1549204" url="?curid=1123780" title="Kimbanguism">
<text>Kimbanguism () is a Christian new religious movement professed by the African initiated church Jesus Christ&#x27;s Church on Earth by his special envoy Simon Kimbangu (, EJCSK) founded by Simon Kimbangu in the Belgian Congo (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1921. A large, independent African-initiated church, it has an estimated 6 million believers and has its headquarters in Nkamba, Kongo Central. The denomination became a member of the World Council of Churches, the All Africa Conference of Churches, and the Organization of African Instituted Churches. In June 2021, the World Council of Churches withdrew membership on doctrinal grounds.

== History ==

In April 1921, Kimbangu, a Baptist mission catechist, inaugurated a mass movement through his supposed miraculous healings and biblical teaching. His teachings attracted working people, who left jobs to hear him speak about liberation. This threatened the colonial labor structure and thus the Belgian regime. The Belgian authorities treated the faith with suspicion and imprisoned Kimbangu until his death in 1951. The church was formally recognised by the Belgian colonial authorities in 1959.

Some smaller, more loosely organised groups in Central Africa regard Kimbangu as God&#x27;s prophet.

===Life and works of Kimbangu===
According to the church, Kimbangu is said to have come down to Earth from Mount Zion as a Congolese infant. His father had been a traditional religious leader, but both parents died and Kimbangu was orphaned and put in the care of his maternal aunt. She took him to Baptist missionary school where he studied for many years, Until when he grew up became a preacher. Some statisticians have estimated that the amount of Kimbanguists have reached thirty two million.

== Beliefs and practices ==
The church eschews politics and embraces Puritan ethics, rejecting the use of violence, polygamy, magic and witchcraft, alcohol, tobacco, and dancing. Its worship is Baptist in form, though the Eucharist was not introduced until 1971.

The three key dates in the Kimbanguist calendar are 6 April (marking the date of the start of the ministry of healing), 25 May (marking Christmas, falling on the birthday of Father Dialungana), and 12 October (Kimbangu&#x27;s death anniversary). The church is largely non-sacramental, with large services that are well-organised.

The church also believes that Nkamba is the New Jerusalem mentioned in the Bible.

The church also believes that Kimbangu is the Holy Spirit, in accordance with John 14:15–17. Like many Christian groups, the Kimbanguists begin and end prayers with the Trinitarian formula.

Alongside Kimbangu, the Trinity are Father Kisolokele (first son of Kimbangu) as God the Father, Father Salomon Diangani Dialungana (the reincarnated Jesus and second son of Kimbangu), Father Diangienda Kuntima (last son, reincarnation of Kimbangu and second human form of the Holy Spirit), and Father Simon Kimbangu Kiangani (grandson of Kimbangu, third human form of the Holy Spirit, and current spiritual leader of the church since 2001). 

The doctrinal status given by this church to Kimbangu has led to international controversy as contrary to the doctrine of the Trinity and therefore heretical. In 2021 the church’s membership in the World Council of Churches (WCC) was discontinued by the Central Committee of the WCC on theological grounds.

==Hierarchy==

<doc id="1123781" wikidata="Q2481085" url="?curid=1123781" title="Electabuzz">
<text>Electabuzz (), known in Japan as , is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. First introduced in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, it has appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as various merchandise. In media related to the franchise, Electabuzz has been voiced by various voice actors, including Unshō Ishizuka, Kōichi Sakaguchi, and Kenta Miyake.

Classified as an Electric-type Pokémon, Electabuzz is a large yellow creature with a long tail and a striped pattern across its body, which generates a massive amount of electricity. Originally part of a trio of similar Pokémon during development, one was cut from the final game leaving its counterpart to be the Fire-type Pokémon Magmar. Though it does not evolve in the original games, it was later given a pre-evolution in sequel titles &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; in the form of Elekid, and in &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; can evolve into the Pokémon Electivire.

Electabuzz has received a mostly positive reception since its debut, being highlighted for its design and various unique design aspects, such as its rivalry with Magmar and its voice in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series.

==Conception and design==
Electabuzz is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

When making the games, the design first started as pixel art sprites by the development team, created with a single color identity chosen to work within the Super Game Boy hardware limitations. While conceived as a group effort by multiple developers at Game Freak, once development was complete Sugimori re-drew the species along with the others in his own artstyle in order to give the game a unified look and finalize any design elements, while also trying to maintain the original sprite artist&#x27;s unique style. Standing 3 ft 7 in (109 cm) tall, Electabuzz is classified as an Electric-type Pokémon. It is a bipedal creature covered in yellow fur with black stripes throughout it, a round stomach, and a striped tail. Electabuzz&#x27;s head and mouth are wide with two fangs protruding from the upper lip, and a black &quot;V&quot; shaped patch of fur between its eyes. Two tuffs of hair extend upward from the center of it head, with antenna-like protrusions on either side. Its forearms are enlarged and end in four fingered hands, while its feet have two clawed toes each with a talon in the rear. In-Universe, Electabuzz&#x27;s body generates a massive amount of electricity which it uses to communicate with others of its kind, and will become enraged upon seeing the color red.

Called Eleboo in Japan, during development it was part of a trio of thematically similar Pokémon that consists of the Fire-Type Magmar, called Booba in Japan, and another Pokémon called Buu. However, Buu was cut from the final release, leaving just itself and Magmar. When the games were localized for English-speaking audiences, Nintendo of America gave the various Pokémon species descriptive names related to their appearance or features as a means to make them more relatable to American children. Its name was localized to Electabuzz, a combination of &quot;Electric&quot; and &quot;Buzz&quot;. Though it is not part of an evolutionary line in the original games, the sequels &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; introduced Elekid, a Pokémon that evolves into Electabuzz. Years later, the games &quot;Pokémon Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; introduced Electivire, a Pokémon Electabuzz evolves into if traded while equipped with a &quot;Electirizer&quot; in-game item. This method was simplified in later games, removing the trade requirement and allowing Electabuzz to evolve by using the Eletirizer item directly on it.

==Appearances==
Electabuzz first appeared in the games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. It has since gone on to appear in several other games in the series, such as &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot;. It has been the focus of events in &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, including one to celebrate the Chinese New Year where it represented the Year of the Tiger.

Electabuzz has additionally appeared in other &quot;Pokémon&quot; media, such as the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. It was also featured in several episodes of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, where it was voiced by several actors including Unshō Ishizuka, Kōichi Sakaguchi, and Kenta Miyake.

==Critical reception==
Since its debut, Electabuzz has received mostly positive reception. Due to many shared aspects, such as receiving new elements of their evolutionary line in the same games, while at the same time only being available for capture in separate titles within each pair of releases for the franchise, media outlets have come to regard Electabuzz and Magmar as rivals. Meanwhile, shared gameplay buffs the pair have received in later &quot;Pokémon&quot; titles have received praise for helping them stay viable for competitive usage, and furthermore called a positive trend some wish to see continued in the series.

&quot;IGN&quot; in their &quot;Pokémon of the Day&quot; series of articles stated that while they had overlooked the species in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; Electabuzz had quickly become a favorite of theirs and appreciated its &quot;unique charms&quot; and variety it brought to the game&#x27;s Electric-type Pokémon. In another article for the site, editor Jack DeVries described the species as resembling &quot;an electrified Sasquatch&quot;, and though he called it a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; sort of character observed it was not without fans. Kyle Hilliard described it as an &quot;electric cat with antennae and clawed feet&quot;, and praised it as a &quot;novel concept&quot;. Jerrad Wyche of &quot;TheGamer&quot; on the other hand denounced it as one of the franchise&#x27;s ugliest designs, stating that part of the issue was due to how &quot;uncanny its human-like anatomy is&quot;. Echoing DeVries&#x27; comparison to a Sasquatch, he felt that this was contrary to how many Pokémon could more readily be compared to real-world counterparts to help viewers comprehend them.

Other aspects of discussion revolved around Electivire and Electabuzz&#x27;s design in light of it. Nathan Ellingsworth of &quot;Pocket Tactics&quot; called Electabuzz one of the best Pokémon designs introduced in the series, stating while he appreciated the introduction of Elekid later on, he felt Electivire was unnecessary as to him &quot;Electabuzz was all good&quot; being the final part of its evolutionary line and able to stand on its own strengths. On the other hand Robert Grosso of &quot;TechRaptor&quot; disagreed, stating that &quot;Electabuzz was always a goofy-looking Pokémon&quot; with a &quot;somewhat silly design&quot;, and he felt by comparison Electivire &quot;exudes confidence and presence when you first look at it.&quot; Oliver Brandt of &quot;Parade&quot; added that while Electabuzz was &quot;fine&quot;, it always felt lacking to them and had the &quot;vibe of a Pokémon that was meant to have an evolution but just never did&quot;. He further described Electivire as one of the &quot;most ridiculously cool Pokémon ever to exist&quot;, calling its design perfect and that it did &quot;the awkward teenage Electabuzz&quot; justice.

In the anime, Electabuzz&#x27;s animal cry is different from many other Pokémon in the series: instead of parroting its name, it will make a sound akin to &quot;that which is made when rocking the head side to side while loosely &quot;buzzing&quot; the lips&quot;. Edd Rose of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; felt this was a clever way to avoid having the cry sound human, and while jarring was a memorable aspect of the adaptation. Laura Thornton in another article instead observed that the sound seemed to be a pronunciation of the species&#x27; Japanese name instead, and suggested it may be an attempt to mimic the sound of one being electrocuted. Alternatively, she suggested the character&#x27;s design may be a reference to oni, a type of Japanese yokai that wear tiger skin apparel and sometimes control lightning, and in this context the cry could be intended to &quot;inspire fear in their adversaries by invoking that resemblance&quot;. Though she noted that much later in the series the cry was changed to match other Pokémon, she felt this &quot;removed one small touch of humor from the show in favor of a bit more gravitas&quot;, and that the initial sound team&#x27;s effort&#x27;s left a lasting impression of the character on viewers and presented &quot;a unique cry that can never be imitated or forgotten&quot;.

&quot;TheGamer&quot;″s Editor in Chief Stacey Henley called its perceived rivalry with Magmar one of the franchise&#x27;s few long running arcs, and one of its best stories. While she pointed out they were not the only rivalry in &quot;Pokémon&quot; and how each of those others had their own stories, she felt they were inferior to &quot;the OG head to head&quot;. Henley expressed what made it a good rivalry in her eyes was that Electabuzz and Magmar felt evenly matched, and while she personally preferred many aspects of the former, she felt the latter had more impact in the anime series overall. She expressed hope &quot;Pokemon&quot; as a series could lean into it more, though at the same time wanted it to remain in the background and more spontaneous, drawing comparison to &quot;Family Guy&quot;″s Peter Griffin and his recurring feud with the Giant Chicken character, and in how &quot;the joy is in the unknown, in the ways it could be constantly coming to a boil, in where it might go next&quot;.

In an article for &quot;Game Developer&quot;, Caleb Compton cited Electabuzz in a comparison between the designs of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; and its sequel titles, specifically comparing it to another Electric-type Pokémon introduced in the latter named Ampharos. He observed that while both were primarily yellow with black stripes, the placement of the stripes on Ampharos felt more like a deliberate design choice, and with Electabuzz, while there was design consideration the stripes seemed more a part of its fur, and an example of how &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;″s Pokémon designs had shifted away from a more natural feel.

<doc id="1123783" wikidata="Q132135" url="?curid=1123783" title="Nick Buoniconti">
<text>Nicholas Anthony Buoniconti (, December 15, 1940 – July 30, 2019) was an American professional football player who was a middle linebacker in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Buoniconti played professionally for the Boston Patriots and Miami Dolphins, winning two Super Bowls with the Dolphins. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Early life and family==
Nicholas Buoniconti was born to Nicholas Anthony Buoniconti Sr. and Pasqualina &quot;Patsy&quot; Mercolino in Springfield, Massachusetts. The couple ran a family bakery in the predominantly Italian South End of the city called Mercolino&#x27;s Italian Bakery (closed in its 99th year around September 2017). The 3rd generation family bakery was located at: 1011 East Columbus Ave., Springfield, MA, 01105. They were known for their delicious baked Italian breads, loafs, etc. Nick was raised Roman Catholic and played football for Cathedral High School, where a plaque honoring him as a &quot;Hometown Hall of Famer&quot; was unveiled in 2012.

Nicholas Buoniconti graduated from Notre Dame and was drafted by the American Football League&#x27;s Patriots in the 13th round of the 1962 AFL draft.

In 1985, his son Marc suffered a spinal cord injury making a tackle for The Citadel, rendering him a quadriplegic. Nick became the public face of the group that founded the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, now one of the world&#x27;s leading neurological research centers.

Nick was married twice and had three children by his first marriage.

==College career==
In 1960, as a junior, was second on the Fighting Irish in tackles (behind senior captain Myron Pottios) with 71. As a senior in 1961, Nick led the team with 74 tackles as the Irish co-captain and was rewarded with 2nd-team All-America selections from UPI, TSN, and the Football Coaches&#x27; Association. Nick was the only All-American on Notre Dame&#x27;s 1961 team.

==Professional career==
As a tackle, Nicholas Buoniconti was the captain of the 1961 Notre Dame football team, but NFL scouts considered him too small to play pro football. Drafted in the 13th round by the Boston Patriots in the 1962 American Football League college draft and switched to linebacker, Nicholas Buoniconti made an immediate impact, as Nick was named the team&#x27;s rookie of the year. The following year, Buoniconti helped Boston capture the 1963 AFL Eastern Division title. With Boston, Buoniconti appeared in five AFL All-Star Games, and recorded 24 interceptions, which is still the seventh-most in team history. Nick was named 2nd team All-AFL in 1963 and the following season began a run of five consensus All-AFL seasons in the following six seasons, missing only 1968 when Buoniconti was named second-team All-AFL. Buoniconti is a member of the Patriots All-1960s (AFL) Team and the AFL All-Time Team.

Buoniconti was traded to the AFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins in 1969. Nick continued to play well with the Dolphins, in 1969–1974 and 1976, and made the AFL All-Star team in 1969 and the NFL Pro Bowl in 1972 and 1973, when Nick led the Dolphins to Super Bowl wins. Buoniconti was also named All-AFC in 1972.

His leadership made him a cornerstone of the Dolphins&#x27; defense. During his years there, the team advanced to three consecutive Super Bowl appearances under Don Shula, the second of which was the team&#x27;s 1972 undefeated season. In 1973, Buoniconti recorded a then-team record 162 tackles (91 unassisted). Nick was named to the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl in 1972 and 1973.

Buoniconti ended his career with an unofficial 24 sacks, 18 with the Patriots and six while with the Dolphins. His 32 career interceptions rank him third all-time among NFL linebackers.His interception of Billy Kilmer late in the second quarter of Super Bowl VII set up Miami&#x27;s second touchdown, which proved to be the clincher in the Dolphins&#x27; 14–7 victory over the Washington Redskins to complete the 17–0 season.

He was named the Dolphins&#x27; Most Valuable Player three times (1969, 1970, 1973). In 1990, Buoniconti was voted as a linebacker on the Dolphins&#x27; Silver Anniversary All-Time team. On November 18, 1991, Buoniconti was enshrined on the Miami Dolphin&#x27;s Honor Roll at Hard Rock Stadium.

==Post-playing career==
Buoniconti earned a J.D. degree from Suffolk University Law School during his years with the Patriots. He was a practicing attorney for a short time. As an agent, he represented some 30 professional athletes, including baseball players Bucky Dent and Andre Dawson. He was also president of the United States Tobacco Company during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Buoniconti was a leading critic of studies which showed that smokeless tobacco caused cancer of the mouth as well as other types of cancer.

In a televised interview on the Comedy Channel toward the end of 1990, when asked his reaction to the last two undefeated teams of the season suffering losses the same Sunday, Buoniconti, indicating his cheerful countenance, told &quot;Night After Night&quot;&#x27;s Allan Havey, &quot;You know, I think this smile might just stay permanently on my face.&quot;

Buoniconti also appeared in one of the Miller Lite &quot;Do you know me?&quot; TV ads, in which he talked about the No-Name Defense. The punch line was a variation on an old joke, with Buoniconti remarking that &quot;everyone&quot; knows him now. A passerby remarks, &quot;Hey, I know you... you&#x27;re... uh... uh...&quot; trying to recall Buoniconti&#x27;s name. Upon being told that it&#x27;s Nick Buoniconti, the passerby says, &quot;No, that&#x27;s not it.&quot;

Buoniconti was a co-host of the HBO series &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; from 1978 until 2001. In 2001, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, where he joined his &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; co-host, Len Dawson, who was inducted in 1987.

Buoniconti is a member of the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.

Buoniconti openly shared that he struggled with neurological issues, with one or several different diagnoses potentially being the cause. On November 3, 2017, he announced that he would posthumously donate his brain to aid CTE research. In March 2018, he joined with former NFL stars Harry Carson and Phil Villapiano to support a parent initiative called Flag Football Under 14, which advises no tackle football under that age.

==Death==
Buoniconti died of pneumonia on July 30, 2019, in Bridgehampton, New York, at the age of 78. He was one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with CTE, which is caused by repeated hits to the head.

<text>Person-centered therapy (PCT), also known as person-centered psychotherapy, person-centered counseling, client-centered therapy and Rogerian psychotherapy, is a form of psychotherapy developed by psychologist Carl Rogers and colleagues beginning in the 1940s and extending into the 1980s. Person-centered therapy seeks to facilitate a client&#x27;s actualizing tendency, &quot;an inbuilt proclivity toward growth and fulfillment&quot;, via acceptance (&quot;unconditional positive regard&quot;), therapist &quot;congruence&quot; (genuineness), and empathic understanding.

==History and influences==
Person-centered therapy was developed by Carl Rogers in the 1940s and 1950s, and was brought to public awareness largely through his book &quot;Client-centered Therapy&quot;, published in 1951. It has been recognized as one of the major types of psychotherapy (theoretical orientations), along with psychodynamic psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, classical Adlerian psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, existential therapy, and others. Its underlying theory arose from the results of empirical research; it was the first theory of therapy to be driven by empirical research, with Rogers at pains to reassure other theorists that &quot;the facts are always friendly&quot;. Originally called non-directive therapy, it &quot;offered a viable, coherent alternative to Freudian psychotherapy. ... [Rogers] redefined the therapeutic relationship to be different from the Freudian authoritarian pairing.&quot; 

Person-centered therapy is often described as a humanistic therapy, but its main principles appear to have been established before those of humanistic psychology. Some have argued that &quot;it does not in fact have much in common with the other established humanistic therapies&quot; but, by the mid-1960s, Rogers accepted being categorized with other humanistic (or phenomenological-existential) psychologists in contrast to behavioral and psychoanalytic psychologists. Despite the importance of the self to person-centered theory, the theory is fundamentally organismic and holistic in nature, with the individual&#x27;s unique self-concept at the center of the unique &quot;sum total of the biochemical, physiological, perceptual, cognitive, emotional and interpersonal behavioural subsystems constituting the person&quot;.

Rogers coined the term &quot;counselling&quot; in the 1940s because, at that time, psychologists were not legally permitted to provide psychotherapy in the US. Only medical practitioners were allowed to use the term &quot;psychotherapy&quot; to describe their work.

Rogers affirmed individual personal experience as the basis and standard for living and therapeutic effect. This emphasis contrasts with the dispassionate position which may be intended in other therapies, particularly the behavioral therapies. Hallmarks of Rogers&#x27;s person-centered therapy include: living in the present rather than the past or future; organismic trust; naturalistic faith in one&#x27;s own thoughts and the accuracy in one&#x27;s feelings; a responsible acknowledgment of one&#x27;s freedom; and a view toward participating fully in our world and contributing to other peoples&#x27; lives. Rogers also claimed that the therapeutic process is, in essence, composed of the accomplishments made by the client. The client, having already progressed further along in their growth and maturation development, only progresses further with the aid of a psychologically favored environment.

Although client-centered therapy has been criticized by behaviorists for lacking structure and by psychoanalysts for actually providing a conditional relationship, it has been shown to be an effective treatment.

== The necessary and sufficient conditions ==
Rogers (1957; 1959) stated that there are six necessary and sufficient conditions required for therapeutic change:

# &quot;Therapist–client psychological contact&quot;: A relationship between client and therapist must exist, and it must be a relationship in which each person&#x27;s perception of the other is important.
# &quot;Client incongruence&quot;: Incongruence (as defined by Carl Rogers; &quot;a lack of alignment between the real self and the ideal self&quot;) exists between the client&#x27;s experience and awareness.
# &quot;Therapist congruence, or genuineness&quot;: The therapist is congruent within the therapeutic relationship; the therapist is deeply involved—they are not &quot;acting&quot;—and they can draw on their own experiences (self-disclosure) to facilitate the relationship.
# &quot;Therapist unconditional positive regard&quot;: The therapist accepts the client unconditionally, without judgment, disapproval, or approval. This facilitates increased self-regard in the client, as they can begin to become aware of experiences in which their view of self-worth was distorted or denied.
# &quot;Therapist empathic understanding&quot;: The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client&#x27;s internal frame of reference. Accurate empathy on the part of the therapist helps the client believe the therapist&#x27;s unconditional regard for them.
# &quot;Client perception&quot;: The client perceives, to at least a minimal degree, the therapist&#x27;s unconditional positive regard and empathic understanding.

The three conditions specific to the therapist/counselor came to be called the of PCT: therapist congruence, unconditional positive regard or acceptance, and accurate empathic understanding. There is a large body of publications of empirical research on these conditions.

==Processes==
Rogers believed that a therapist who embodies the three critical and reflexive attitudes (the three core conditions) will help liberate their client to more confidently express their true feelings without fear of judgement. To achieve this, the client-centered therapist carefully avoids directly challenging their client&#x27;s way of communicating themselves in the session in order to enable a deeper exploration of the issues most intimate to them and free from external referencing. Rogers was not prescriptive in telling his clients what to do, but believed that the answers to the clients&#x27; questions were within the client and not the therapist. Accordingly, the therapist&#x27;s role was to create a facilitative, empathic environment wherein the client could discover the answers for themselves.

<text>Pitt Island (Moriori: , ) is the second largest island in New Zealand&#x27;s Chatham Islands, with an area of . It lies about to the east of New Zealand&#x27;s main islands, and about to the southeast of Chatham Island, from which it is separated by Pitt Strait. The island is hilly; its highest point (Waihere Head) rises to above sea level. , Pitt Island had a population of about 38 people.
Pitt Island&#x27;s Kahuitara Point is the first populated location on Earth to observe a sunrise in each new year, based on local time zone.

==History==

Pitt Island was originally inhabited by the Moriori, the indigenous peoples of the Chatham Islands, who called it &quot;Rangiaotea&quot; or &quot;Rangihaute&quot;. Their archaeological remains are found almost everywhere on the island; large quantities of artefacts are constantly coming to light. No remains of momori rakau are visible on the island, but there are records of them once being present.

The first Europeans to see and name Chatham Island were the crew of William Robert Broughton&#x27;s ship in November 1791. However, they did not see Pitt Island. The first to do so was Captain Charles Johnston on in May 1807. He named it &#x27;Pitt&#x27;s Island&#x27; after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. In 1840, the name was simplified to &quot;Pitt&quot; Island. Taranaki Maori who invaded the Chatham Islands in 1835 called it &quot;Rangiauria&quot;, a name which is still in use today.

Over the years there have been many ships wrecked around both Pitt and Chatham Islands. One of these was the Australian sealing brig &quot;Glory&quot;, which was wrecked on Pitt Island in what became known as Glory Bay in January 1827.

European settlers arrived in the Flower Pot Bay in 1843.

==Economy and facilities==
The main sources of income for Pitt Islanders are farming, commercial fishing, and tourism. The New Zealand Department of Conservation is active on Pitt Island and, in conjunction with several landowners, administers a number of covenanted areas and reserves. The island imports fuel and most manufactured goods, and exports live sheep and cattle to mainland New Zealand.

The island has a school, a wharf, a church and a grass landing strip for light planes. A gravel road runs from Flower Pot Bay to the airstrip. A supply ship visits Pitt Island about every three months. Each household generates its own electricity, by either diesel generator or wind turbine. Most homes have satellite TV and broadband internet connections. Transport on the island is mostly by means of quad bikes, four wheel drives and occasionally horses. In 2011, the Pitt Island School had eight children, aged between 6 and 12 years.

Air Chathams operates from Pitt Island to Chatham Island with their Cessna 206.

==Fauna and flora==
On Pitt Island there are several flocks of feral Saxon Merino sheep.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior is a series of nine-cylinder, air-cooled, radial aircraft engines built by the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Company from the 1930s to the 1950s. These engines have a displacement of ; initial versions produced , while the most widely used versions produce .

Wasp Juniors have powered numerous smaller civil and military aircraft, including small transports, utility aircraft, trainers, agricultural aircraft, and helicopters. Over 39,000 engines were built, and many are still in service today.

==Design and development==
Pratt &amp; Whitney developed the R-985 Wasp Junior as a smaller version of the R-1340 Wasp to compete in the market for medium-sized aircraft engines. Like its larger brother, the Wasp Junior was an air-cooled, nine-cylinder radial, with its power boosted by a gear-driven single-speed centrifugal type supercharger. Its cylinders were smaller, however, with a bore and stroke of , giving a 27% lesser total displacement. The Wasp Junior used many parts from the Wasp and even had the same mounting dimensions, allowing an aircraft to easily use either the smaller or the larger engine. The first run of the Wasp Junior was in 1929, and sales began in 1930. The initial version, the Wasp Junior A, produced .

The U.S. military designated the Wasp Junior as the R-985, with various suffixes denoting different military engine models. However, Pratt &amp; Whitney never adopted the R-985 designation scheme for its civilian Wasp Juniors, identifying them simply by name and model (e.g. &quot;Wasp Junior A&quot;).

Pratt &amp; Whitney followed the Wasp Junior A with more powerful models in the &quot;A series&quot;. These had higher compression ratios, greater RPM limits, and more effective supercharging, and they led to the &quot;B series&quot;. The first B series model was the Wasp Junior TB, which could maintain at sea level and could reach for takeoff. The TB was tuned for best performance at sea level; it was soon joined by the Wasp Junior SB, which was tuned for best performance at altitude and could sustain at altitudes up to , with available for takeoff. A still later model, the Wasp Junior T1B2, had improved performance at low level, being able to sustain up to while still matching the SB&#x27;s power at high altitudes. The SB and T1B2, and later versions of these with similar performance, were the most popular Wasp Junior models. One later development of the T1B2, the Wasp Junior B4, was especially designed for vertical mounting in helicopters.

During the mid-1930s, Pratt &amp; Whitney developed a still greater improvement of the Wasp Junior, the &quot;C series&quot;, with an even higher compression ratio and RPM limit. The only type produced in this series, the Wasp Junior SC-G, could sustain at an altitude of and could produce for takeoff. It also included reduction gearing to allow the high-revving engine to drive a propeller at suitable speeds, hence the &quot;-G&quot; suffix. Aviator Jacqueline Cochran flew a special Model D-17W Beechcraft Staggerwing with this engine in 1937, setting a speed and altitude record and placing third in the Bendix transcontinental race. However, the SC-G never got past the experimental stage.

==Operational history==
Early versions of the Wasp Junior were used in various small civilian and military utility aircraft, but only in limited numbers. The type became more popular later in the 1930s. It was selected for the Lockheed Model 10A Electra twin-engined airliner, as well as for other small twin-engined civil transports like the Lockheed Model 12A Electra Junior, the Beechcraft Model 18, and the Grumman Goose amphibious aircraft. It was also used in single-engined civilian utility aircraft like the Beechcraft Staggerwing, the Howard DGA-15, and the Spartan Executive.

As World War II arrived, the U.S. military chose the Wasp Junior for the Vultee BT-13 Valiant and North American BT-14 basic training aircraft and for the Vought OS2U Kingfisher observation floatplane. Military versions of existing Wasp Junior-powered civilian aircraft were also produced, such as the military derivatives of the Beech 18, Beech Staggerwing, Grumman Goose, and Howard DGA-15. The Wasp Junior also powered some versions of the British Avro Anson and Airspeed Oxford twin-engined trainers. The demands of World War II led to the production of many thousands of Wasp Juniors.

Until the end of the war, the Wasp Junior&#x27;s closest competitor was Wright Aeronautical&#x27;s R-975 Whirlwind. However, during the war, the Wasp Junior was far more widely used in aircraft than the R-975, and Wright ceased production of the R-975 in 1945.

After World War II, many military-surplus aircraft with Wasp Junior engines entered the civilian market. New designs based on the Wasp Junior were also introduced, such as the Sikorsky H-5 helicopter, the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, and Max Holste Broussard bush airplanes, and agricultural aircraft such as the Snow S-2B and S-2C, Grumman Ag Cat, and Weatherley 201.

Pratt &amp; Whitney ceased production of the Wasp Junior in 1953, having built 39,037 engines. Many Wasp Junior engines are still in use today in older bush planes and agricultural planes, as well as in antique aircraft. Some antique aircraft, such as the Boeing-Stearman Model 75, which originally used other engines, have had them replaced with the Wasp Junior to provide more power or for easier maintenance, since parts for the Wasp Junior are readily available.

<doc id="1123810" wikidata="Q704094" url="?curid=1123810" title="Dwayne De Rosario">
<text>Dwayne Anthony De Rosario OOnt (born May 15, 1978) is a Canadian former professional soccer player, who played as a forward or as an attacking midfielder. A versatile attacker, he played for the Toronto Lynx, FSV Zwickau and Richmond Kickers early in his career. He came to prominence in the 2000s playing in Major League Soccer for the San Jose Earthquakes, Houston Dynamo, Toronto FC, New York Red Bulls and D.C. United. A four-time MLS Cup champion, he also won the 2011 MLS Most Valuable Player award. He is the ninth-leading scorer in MLS history with 104 goals. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most decorated Canadian players of all time.

Internationally, De Rosario represented the Canadian national team from 1998 to 2015 where he was the country&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, with 22 goals in 81 games. De Rosario is a 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup champion and four-time Canadian Player of the Year. He is an honoured member of the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame and Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Born in Scarborough, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, De Rosario is the son of Guyanese immigrants to Canada. He began playing soccer at age three with Scarborough Blizzard SC, later playing with the Malvern Majors. As a 14-year-old, De Rosario rejected an offer from A.C. Milan after a successful trial because he was not ready to commit to living in Italy. De Rosario went to Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute in Scarborough.

De Rosario began his professional career in 1997 at the age of 18, signing with the Toronto Lynx of the A-League. Halfway through the season, however, De Rosario signed with German side FSV Zwickau. After two seasons with Zwickau, De Rosario returned to North America, signing with the Richmond Kickers in 1999. After a slow 1999 season, in which he registered two goals and five assists, De Rosario scored fifteen goals and provided five assists while leading the team to a 20–6–1 record in 2000.

== Club career ==

=== San Jose Earthquakes ===

The next season, when Canadian Frank Yallop was named head coach of the San Jose Earthquakes, De Rosario was one of his first acquisitions. De Rosario proved Yallop&#x27;s judgment right, scoring five goals and four assists in only 1,072 minutes for the Earthquakes in 2001, playing an important role as the team went on to win the MLS Cup; he scored the golden goal in the final and was named MLS Cup MVP. De Rosario had similar success in 2002, registering four goals and eight assists in 1,637 minutes, though the Quakes fell short of a repeat. In 2003, a torn ACL hobbled De Rosario for much of the season but he still managed to make a late surge, registering four goals and three assists in only 686 minutes and helping lead the team to a second MLS Cup championship. De Rosario played 1,211 minutes in 2004, scoring five goals, including the 2004 MLS Goal of the Year, and three assists.

In December 2004 De Rosario had a trial with Nottingham Forest, but he was not offered a contract by the team.

In 2005, following Landon Donovan&#x27;s departure, De Rosario moved to midfield and promptly led MLS in assists with 13, while scoring nine goals, including the 2005 MLS Goal of the Year – the only player ever to receive that honour in two consecutive years – for a powerful bending free kick in the last regular season game against the Los Angeles Galaxy. He was named to the MLS Best XI six times (2005–07, 2009–11).

=== Houston Dynamo ===

Due to San Jose&#x27;s failure to reach a stadium agreement with AEG, De Rosario, along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, moved to Houston for the 2006 season. During the 2006 MLS All-Star Game in Chicago, De Rosario scored the only goal of the game in the 70th minute to lift the MLS All Stars to a 1–0 win over Chelsea, a pre-season friendly for the London club. De Rosario was one of only four players on the MLS team to play the entire match.

De Rosario and the Houston Dynamo captured the 2006 MLS Cup title by beating the New England Revolution on November 12, 2006. The Dynamo won in a shootout, and De Rosario successfully converted his penalty kick. De Rosario signed a contract extension with Houston through 2010, where he was reported to make $325,000 per year. He was later transferred to Toronto before the end of his contract.

The next year, De Rosario assisted on Joseph Ngwenya&#x27;s equalizing goal and scored the winning goal of the 2007 MLS Cup final, giving Houston a 2–1 win over the Revolution and the Dynamo their second championship. De Rosario was named MLS Cup MVP, the first player ever to win the award twice.

De Rosario made his third consecutive all-star appearance at the 2008 MLS All-Star Game in his home country, when the game was held in Toronto. He scored the decisive goal on a penalty kick in the 69th minute in the MLS All-Stars&#x27; 3–2 victory over West Ham United.

=== Toronto FC ===

De Rosario was traded to Toronto FC on December 12, 2008, in return for Julius James and allocation money, after long speculation that De Rosario would move to his hometown club. He made his competitive debut for Toronto FC on Saturday, March 21 against the Kansas City Wizards, setting up Jim Brennan for Toronto&#x27;s first goal in a 3–2 victory. He scored his first goal for Toronto from a header in a 1–1 draw at BMO Field against FC Dallas.

De Rosario was expected to miss the first two to four weeks of Toronto FC&#x27;s training camp due to a calf injury obtained in the January 31, 2010, match against Jamaica, and returned to game action in Toronto&#x27;s 1–0 preseason win versus the University of South Florida.

On April 8, 2010, De Rosario was named captain of Toronto FC, the second in the club&#x27;s history, after the retirement of Jim Brennan. Two days later, De Rosario scored his first goal of the 2010 season, his team&#x27;s first, in a 4–1 loss to the New England Revolution.

On April 15, 2010, De Rosario scored twice in Toronto&#x27;s 2–1 home opener win against the Philadelphia Union. In his next game versus the Colorado Rapids, De Rosario scored his fourth goal of the season, and more importantly, became Toronto FC&#x27;s all-time leading scorer in the regular season. De Rosario again found the back of the net on April 25 in a 2–0 home win against Seattle Sounders FC, scoring the first goal, his fifth of the season. Until O&#x27;Brian White scored the second goal for Toronto, De Rosario had previously scored all of Toronto&#x27;s goals up until that point in the season. For his efforts in that game, he was awarded the MLS Player of the Week for week 5. De Rosario was again honoured with the Player of the Week award on week 10 of the MLS season, for his two-goal performance against his former team the San Jose Earthquakes. De Rosario had scored the second and third goal in Toronto FC&#x27;s 3–1 win.

De Rosario continued to have a successful 2010 season for Toronto, culminating in a spot on the MLS All-Star team, scoring a goal in the 5–2 loss to Manchester United.

On August 3, 2010, De Rosario scored against C.D. Motagua in the second leg of Toronto FC&#x27;s CONCACAF Champions League preliminary round tie, which at the time, put TFC ahead on 2–1 on aggregate. They would eventually win 3–2 on aggregate.

On December 28, De Rosario was confirmed to be on trial with Scottish Premier League club Celtic by manager Neil Lennon. Dwayne and Celtic inquired about the possibility of a short-term loan deal until the MLS season kicked off in March, however new Toronto FC coach Aron Winter and the league denied any further negotiations.

De Rosario scored the first Toronto goal of the 2011 season on March 19 in a 4–2 away defeat to Vancouver Whitecaps FC in what was the league&#x27;s first all Canadian match up. The goal scored in the 20th minute was also the 8000th goal scored in Major League Soccer&#x27;s history.

=== New York Red Bulls ===
New York Red Bulls acquired De Rosario on April 1, 2011, in exchange for midfielder Tony Tchani, defender Danleigh Borman and a first round 2012 MLS SuperDraft pick. He scored his first goal for New York on a penalty, as the second goal, in a 3–2 loss to Chivas USA.

=== D.C. United ===

D.C. United acquired De Rosario on June 27, 2011, in exchange for midfielder Dax McCarty. He scored his first goal for the club against his former club New York Red Bulls on his return to Red Bull Arena. On July 30, 2011, his double gave United a 2–0 victory over former club, San Jose. On August 6, 2011, he led United to a 3–3 draw against Toronto F.C. with his hat-trick.
All three goals were scored while United played with ten men following an early ejection of goalkeeper Bill Hamid. His second hat-trick was recorded on September 25, 2011, as he recorded all three goals in the span of 9 minutes, setting another MLS record. De Rosario completed the season with a total of 16 goals and 12 assists over 32 games. Of those, 13 goals and 7 assists were made during his 17 games with United.

On August 29, 2012, De Rosario scored his 100th MLS goal, in a 2–2 home draw against the Red Bulls. He was the seventh player to reach the milestone.

=== Return to Toronto FC ===
After having his option declined by D.C. United, De Rosario returned to Toronto FC on December 18, 2013, after being chosen in the 2013 MLS Re-Entry Draft. He officially signed with the club on January 9, 2014. It was announced on December 3, 2014, that Toronto had declined the option to renew De Rosario&#x27;s contract.

=== Brief retirement ===
De Rosario announced his retirement on May 10, 2015, and that he would be taking an ambassador role with Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment.

===Mississauga MetroStars===
In October 2018 De Rosario came out of retirement to sign with the newly formed MASL club, the Mississauga MetroStars; he later scored his first goal for the club in the MetroStars&#x27;s opening match, an 11–3 loss away to the Baltimore Blast.

== International career ==
De Rosario represented the Canadian U-20 team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship, and the Canadian U-23 team at the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. He received his first senior cap for Canada on May 18, 1998, against FYR Macedonia at the age of 20. He won the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup with Canada and represented them as well at the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup.

In 2007, De Rosario won the male Canadian Player of the Year award making it three consecutive years receiving the honour. In 2007, he scored five goals in eight games, the most in a year for the CMNT since John Catliff in 1993.

De Rosario was picked for his first CONCACAF Gold Cup in four years, after being selected by coach Stephen Hart in late May 2011 for the 23-man tournament roster. After a disappointing, 2–0 defeat to United States in the opening game of the group Canada failed to exit the group with a 1–1–1 record, they only managed to score two goals both from De Rosario at the penalty spot. De Rosario continued his goal scoring for with two goals in the opening stage of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, one came against Saint Lucia in early September and the other against Saint Kitts and Nevis in mid November. His goal against Saint Kitts, was his 19th international goal which tied him as Canadian all-time top goal scorer with Dale Mitchell. On December 14, De Rosario was awarded 2011 Canadian Player of the Year receiving 47.7% of the vote, Simeon Jackson in second and Josh Simpson finishing in third. This was the fourth time De Rosario was honoured with the award. On September 7, 2012, De Rosario scored his 20th goal for Canada in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Panama, making him the all-time leading goal scorer for Canada.

In De Rosario&#x27;s final appearance for Canada, he scored a goal in a 1–1 draw with Iceland on January 19, 2015.

De Rosario was the country&#x27;s all-time leading male goalscorer, with 22 international goals in 81 matches, until Cyle Larin surpassed his record in 2022.

== Personal life ==
De Rosario adopted a strict vegan diet in 1994, but started eating fish ten years later. He is married to Brandy De Rosario and has four children, including his sons Osaze and Adisa, who are also professional soccer players. His cousin is Olympic hurdler Priscilla Lopes-Schliep. He was appointed to the Order of Ontario in February 2020. His autobiography &#x27;DeRo: My Life&#x27;, written with Brendan Dunlop was published in May 2021 by ECW Press.

===DeRo United Futbol Academy===
In 2012, De Rosario established the DeRo United Futbol Academy. They entered a team in the League1 Ontario women&#x27;s division beginning in 2018.

<text>Giovanni Francesco Anerio (7 July 1569 - 11 June 1630) was an Italian composer of the Roman School, of the very late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. He was the younger brother of Felice Anerio. Giovanni&#x27;s principal importance in music history was his contribution to the early development of the oratorio; he represented the progressive trend within the otherwise conservative Roman School, though he also shared some of the stylistic tendencies of his brother, who was much indebted to Palestrina.

==Life==
He was born in Rome on 7 July 1569. He was a choirboy at Cappella Giulia in St. Peter&#x27;s under Palestrina from 1575 to 1579. He clearly decided to become a priest from an early age, and became associated with the Oratory of Filippo Neri around 1583. In 1595 he was employed as an organist at S Marcello, and likely became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano, after Francesco Soriano, between 1600 or 1601 and 1603. In 1609 he held a similar post at Verona Cathedral, his first appointment outside of Rome; he stayed there until 1610, when he went back to Rome; and he stayed there, aside for a few travels, until 1624, in a variety of roles (becoming a priest at last in 1616). In 1624 he took the position of choirmaster to King Sigismund III of Poland in Warsaw. Poland had several active musical centers in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, including Kraków and Warsaw, and often employed Italians and Germans; Anerio was one of the more distinguished foreigners to take up residence there. Unfortunately he never saw Rome again; he died while traveling back home, while in Graz, Austria, and was buried there on 12 June 1630.

==Musical style==
Giovanni Anerio was a much more progressive composer than his brother, and in the conservative environment of Rome in the early 17th century, this was progressive indeed. Many of his madrigals were monodies, borrowing a style which came from Florence and other locations to the north; his motets and masses, on the other hand, are conservative and use the Palestrina style, though the motets include figured bass, another innovation from the first decade of the 17th century. Some influence from Viadana is evident in these pieces.

Some of his masses are polychoral, a technique which involved multiple, spatially separated groups of singers. While this was also a technique which developed in Venice, it was widespread by the end of the 16th century: almost all composers of sacred polyphony used polychoral techniques at some time, especially those working in large acoustical environments (such as most cathedrals in Europe).

The most important achievement of the younger Anerio, however, was his &quot;Teatro armonico spirituale&quot; of 1619, which is arguably the first oratorio. It includes the earliest surviving obbligato writing for instruments by the Roman School. Instrumentation is indicated with unusual care, and the alternate instrumental and vocal passages were greatly influential in works of the following decades. Unlike the works of the Venetian school, many of which were essentially grandiose motets, the &quot;Teatro armonico spirituale&quot; was in Italian; it included stories told musically but not acted (as would be done in opera); and voices and instruments alternated movement by movement. The piece included settings of the tale of the Prodigal Son and the Conversion of Saul.

==Works==
Anerio was a prolific composer, and he wrote motets, litanies, antiphons, &quot;sacred concertos,&quot; responsories, psalms, madrigals, much miscellaneous sacred and secular music, as well as a handful of instrumental pieces. Most were published in Rome; many fewer works from his Polish period seem to have been preserved, although two polychoral Masses found in manuscript (one for three choirs) can be attributed to this last phase of his career.
