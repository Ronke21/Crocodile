<text>Mackenzie Crook (born Paul James Crook, 29 September 1971) is an English actor, director and writer. He played Gareth Keenan in &quot;The Office&quot;, Ragetti in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; franchise, Orell in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, and the title role of &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot;. He is also the creator and star of BBC Four&#x27;s &quot;Detectorists&quot; (2014–2022), for which he won two BAFTA awards. He also plays major roles in TV series &quot;Britannia&quot;, as the opposite leading druids Veran and Harka.

==Early life==
Crook was born on 29 September 1971 in Maidstone, Kent, and grew up in Dartford, Kent. He is the son of Michael Crook, a British Airways employee, and Sheila Crook, a hospital manager. As a child he received a course of hormone therapy for three years to treat a growth hormone deficiency. 

Crook attended Sutton-at-Hone Primary School and then Wilmington Grammar School for Boys. As there was no drama department at his grammar school, he joined a local youth theatre. He has said that he failed his A-levels because he &quot;completely lost interest&quot; after his GCSEs. In the summers, he spent time at his uncle&#x27;s tobacco farm in northern Zimbabwe, where he developed a love for painting.

Crook&#x27;s first jobs included working at a Pizza Hut restaurant and at Halfords, where he felt he was &quot;waiting for real life to start&quot;.

After moving to London when he was in his early twenties, Crook worked on the comedy circuit, appearing as two characters he created, Mr Bagshawe and Charlie Cheese. He went on to appear in shows at the Edinburgh Fringe, where he was spotted by Bob Mortimer.

==Career==

===Film and television career===
One of Crook&#x27;s earliest television appearances was in the 1998 Channel 4 sketch show &quot;Barking&quot; as grotesque schoolteacher Mr. Bagshaw, said to be based on a variety of obnoxious overbearing science teachers Crook had in school.

Crook was offered his first major television role as a comedy sketch contributor on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Eleven O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; in 1998, from which he was later dropped. He was later a member of the main cast of the BBC sketch show &quot;TV to Go&quot; in 2001.

In late 1999, he hosted the short-lived ITV1 show &quot;Comedy Café&quot; as his Charlie Cheese character. The show, made by Channel X for ITV1, had Cheese interviewing celebrities about their latest live tour, book, album or film release.

In 2001, Crook auditioned for the role of Gareth Keenan in Ricky Gervais&#x27; and Stephen Merchant&#x27;s popular mockumentary &quot;The Office.&quot; Though it was originally written for a larger, thuggish actor, Crook won the role, and in 2001, he was nominated for a British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Breakthrough Artist.

Crook was featured in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007), as Ragetti, a pirate with a comically ill-fitting wooden false eye, who is teamed with Pintel (Lee Arenberg).

Crook has appeared in adverts as the character for Visa and M&amp;Ms. He has also been heard as himself in adverts for MTV and Film4, and as a voiceover artiste for motor insurance company Green Flag in 2007. In 2010 he narrated an advertisement for electrical retailer Currys.

Crook appeared as Launcelot Gobbo in Michael Radford&#x27;s 2004 film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice,&quot; and had a minor role in the 2004 film &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; as a theatre usher. His other film appearances include &quot;The Gathering&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot; (2005).

He has starred in three of Tim Plester and Ben Gregor&#x27;s short films: as Gary Tibbs in &quot;Ant Muzak&quot; (2002), as Servalan in &quot;Blake&#x27;s Junction 7&quot; (2004), and as Glorious George in &quot;World of Wrestling&quot; (2006), all released on DVD. He has done voice-over in the TV series &quot;Modern Toss,&quot; was featured in &quot;I Want Candy&quot; as Mr Dulberg, a quirky university professor; and voiced Rolli Bobbler in the English version of an animated film from Finland called &quot;Quest for a Heart&quot; (original Finnish name &quot;Röllin Sydän&quot;). He also performed a duet with Ricky Gervais in the 2007 &quot;Concert for Diana&quot;.

Crook played the leading role of Paul Callow in the comedy film &quot;Three and Out,&quot; released on 25 April 2008. On 10 May 2008 he appeared in an episode of the BBC1 comedy/drama &quot;Love Soup&quot; playing the character Marty Cady and appeared in an episode of Andrew Davies&#x27; 2008 BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;. He also provided his voice and movements to a character in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, which began filming in January 2009 and was released in 2011.

Crook starred in Wyndham Price&#x27;s drama &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Point&quot; as Comet Snape and appeared in &quot;City of Ember&quot; as Looper, and on TV was featured in the documentary &quot;Tattoos: A Scarred History&quot; (2009). He also appeared in &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot; and the ITV drama &quot;Demons&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Last Van Helsing&quot;) as the vampire Gladiolus Hadilus Tradius Thrip. In January 2009, Crook assisted in the second and third episodes of the third series of the E4 teen drama &quot;Skins&quot;, where he played psychotic Bristol gangster Johnny White. In September 2009, he appeared in &quot;Merlin&quot;, for the first episode of the second season, as Cedric.

In November 2010, Crook starred in &quot;A Reluctant Tragic Hero&quot;, a comic play by Anton Chekhov, on the Sky Arts channel, which also starred Johnny Vegas, with whom he also starred in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot;, a film about the sexual antics of a group of potato delivery men in Birmingham. Crook played Corporal Buckley, a brutal career soldier, in Jimmy McGovern&#x27;s &quot;Accused&quot;, broadcast on BBC1 in November 2010. During the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con it was announced that Crook would play the role of Orell in the third season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

Crook also wrote, directed and starred in the television comedy series &quot;Detectorists&quot;, which was first broadcast on BBC Four on 2 October 2014. Filmed in the countryside of Suffolk and the market town of Framlingham, the show is a gently humorous and affectionate portrayal of a pair of metal-detecting enthusiasts, Andy (Crook) and Lance (Toby Jones), and their colleagues in the fictional Danebury Metal Detecting Club. In 2015, Crook won a British Academy Television Craft Award for Best Writing in a Comedy Series for the show, whilst the series won the British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy. A second series was broadcast in the UK in October/November 2015. A Christmas special was broadcast on 23 December 2015. In 2017 the third and final series of &quot;Detectorists&quot; was broadcast. A final special episode was released for Christmas 2022.

<doc id="1146151" wikidata="Q1433459" url="?curid=1146151" title="Tawûsî Melek">
<text>Tawûsî Melek () is one of the central figures of the Yazidi religion. In Yazidi creation stories, before the creation of this world, God created seven Divine Beings, of whom Tawûsî Melek was appointed as the leader. God assigned all of the world&#x27;s affairs to these seven Divine Beings, also often referred to as the Seven Angels or heft sirr (&quot;the Seven Mysteries&quot;).

In Yazidi beliefs, there is one God, who created Seven Divine beings, the leader of whom is Tawûsî Melek, the Lord of this World, who is responsible for all that happens on this world, both good and bad. According to religious tradition, Nature, with its myriad phenomena of light and darkness, emanates from a single source, who is the Lord of this World, Tawûsî Melek. Qewl passages emphasize Tawûsî Melek&#x27;s power on the earth, in the sky, sea, on the mountains, and their residents, that is, his power exists in all parts of nature, whether celestial or terrestrial.

==Religious significance==
=== Tawûsî Melek in Yazidi beliefs and mythology ===

The Yazidis consider Tawûsî Melek an emanation of God who is a good, benevolent angel and leader of the archangels, who was entrusted to take care of the world after he passed a test and created the cosmos from the Cosmic egg. Yazidis believe that Tawûsî Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a fallen nor a disgraced angel, but an emanation of God himself. The Yazidis believe that the founder or reformer of their religion, Sheikh Adi Ibn Musafir, was an incarnation of Tawûsî Melek.

In Yazidi religious folk beliefs, Tawûsî Melek is described as eternal and an eternal light (&quot;Tawûsî Melek herhey ye û nûra baqî ye&quot;), and in Yazidi mythology, when Tawûsî Melek descended to earth, the seven colours of the rainbow transformed into a seven-coloured bird, the peacock, which flew around every part of earth to bless it, and its last resting place was in Lalish. Hence, in Yazidi mythology, the rainbow is linked with Tawûsî Melek and it is believed that he shows his blessing with the sign of rainbow.

The first Wednesday of &quot;Nîsan&quot; (Eastern April) every year is believed to coincide with Tawûsî Melek&#x27;s descending to earth as light, bringing in the New Year with its joyous renewal of life on earth, when Nature burgeons forth anew in Spring. It therefore became the holy day upon which &quot;Sersal&quot; (Yazidi New Year) is celebrated. On the eve of the feast, 365/366 lamps are lit as the symbol of the descending of Tawûsî Melek to the earth. This number also corresponds to the number of the days in the year.

Yazidi accounts of the creation differ significantly from those of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), since they are derived from the Ancient Mesopotamian and Indo-Iranian traditions; therefore, Yazidi cosmogony is closer to those of Ancient Iranian religions, Vedic Hinduism, Yarsanism and Zoroastrianism.

=== Symbolism of the Peacock in religious life ===
In Yazidism, the Peacock, the symbol or icon of Tawûsî Melek, is believed to represent the diversity of the World, the colourfulness of its feathers being considered to symbolise the myriad colours of Nature. The radiating feathers of the peacock’s tail, revealed when it unfurls them in circular display, are held to symbolise the rays of the sun, bestowing their life-giving light each day at dawn. It is therefore considered a sacred bird, which Yazidis are expressly forbidden to hunt, eat, curse or ill-treat in any way. For this reason countless peacock images are to be found adorning the preeminent sanctuary of Lalish and all manner of other Yazidi shrines and holy sites, as well as the homes of the Yazidi faithful and their social, cultural and academic centres.

== In Yarsanism ==
In Yarsanism, a religion that shares many similarities with Yazidism dating back to pre-Islam, there is also a figure referred to as Malak Tawus, whose identification is tied to the names of angels during various &quot;dowres&quot; (cycles), which denotes range of concepts. Malak Tawus is believed to be &quot;pure and without sin, above and free of any bad actions, obedient and devoted to God and consisting of light.&quot; According to Yarsani doctrine, during the &quot;dowre&quot; of Shari&#x27;at, in which one is being guided by Islamic Law, Malak Tawus was labelled as &quot;Sheytan&quot;, whereas in the &quot;dowre&quot; of Haqiqat (Truth), Malak Tawus is called Dawud, who is one of the seven holy Beings in Yarsanism that are referred to as the &quot;Haft Tan&quot;. Thus, the Yarsanis do not curse Satan.

The term &quot;dowre&quot; may refer to a period of time that started with the Essences (&quot;zāt&quot;) of the Divine and of members of the two Heptads manifesting or incarnating themselves as humans. It also refers to a stage in humanity&#x27;s religious development. The first and initial &quot;dowre&quot; was the stage of &quot;Shari&#x27;at,&quot; where the Islamic Law was or is in charge and guiding everyone. This &quot;dowre&quot; is believed to have begun at creation and concluded with Muhammed, the Truth (&quot;Haqiqat&quot;) is thought to have existed during this stage, but had not yet been perceived. Following the dowre of Shari&#x27;at were the intermediate dowres of &quot;Tariqat,&quot; i.e. the &#x27;Path&#x27; of a mystical Order, and &quot;Ma&#x27;refat,&quot; i.e. Esoteric Knowledge. The former was marked by the development of mystical brotherhoods that allowed people to start learning about esoteric truth. These stages were succeeded by the present &quot;dowre&quot; of &quot;Haqiqat&quot;, which is marked by Sultan Sahak&#x27;s arrival. The &quot;dowre&quot; of Haqiqat is the phase of development in which the advanced mystic fully has perceived the esoteric Truth. Yarsanis are thought to be living in this &quot;dowre,&quot; however, the same is not true for all humans, and most outsiders are still believed to remain in the &quot;dowre&quot; of Shari&#x27;at or the intermediate &quot;dowre&quot;s of Tariqat and Ma&#x27;refat.

==Accusations of alleged devil-worship==

Muslims and followers of other Abrahamic religions have erroneously associated and identified the Peacock Angel with their own conception of the unredeemed evil spirit Satan, a misconception which has incited centuries of violent religious persecution of the Yazidis as &quot;devil-worshippers&quot;. Persecution of Yazidis has continued in their home communities within the borders of modern Iraq.

Some also claimed that Tawûsê Melek was a reference to Ahriman, the evil figure in Zoroastrianism, who had created a peacock to prove that he was also capable of good.

Further accusations were derived from narratives attributed to Melek Taûs, which are actually foreign to Yazidism and probably introduced by either Muslims in the 9th century or Christian missionaries in the 20th century. Accusations of devil-worship fueled centuries of violent religious persecution, which have led Yazidi communities to concentrate in remote mountainous regions of northwestern Iraq. The Yazidi taboo against the Arabic word &quot;Shaitan&quot; (الشیطان) and on words containing the consonants &quot;š&quot; (sh) and &quot;t&quot;/&quot;ṭ&quot; have been used to suggest a connection between Tawûsî Melek and Iblis, although no evidence exists to suggest that Yazidis worship Tawûsî Melek as the same figure. Yazidis did not have the same concept of Satan as Abrahamic religions.

Furthermore, Yazidis do not believe Tawûsî Melek to be a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a fallen angel. In Mishefa Resh, Tawûsî Melek is equated with Ezrayil or Ezazil.

<doc id="1146152" wikidata="Q5303570" url="?curid=1146152" title="Downtown Salt Lake City">
<text>Downtown (also called City Center) is the oldest district in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. The grid from which the entire city is laid out originates at Temple Square, the location of the Salt Lake Temple.

==Location==

Downtown Salt Lake City is usually defined as the area approximately between North Temple and 1300 South Streets north to south and about 500 East and 600 West Streets east to west. Downtown encompasses the areas of Temple Square, The Gateway, Main Street, the central business district, South Temple, and others. Along with local and state government and non profits, two primary business organizations - the Salt Lake Chamber and the Downtown Alliance promote Salt Lake CIty&#x27;s downtown as the heart of the state, and as its most lively and diverse locale. 

==History==
Downtown&#x27;s layout was first planned in 1833, 17 years before Salt Lake City was founded. Joseph Smith designed the Plat of Zion, a plan for cities of 20,000 people each that followed city blocks with self-sufficient family farms surrounding several temples in the center. Smith meant for this plan to be applied to the City of Zion in the Midwestern United States, but following persecution and Smith&#x27;s assassination, the plans were carried westward by the Mormon pioneers. Downtown Salt Lake began to form in 1847 when Brigham Young chose the site of the Salt Lake Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, forming the core of the settlement. Temple Square became the center of the grid system, bounded by South Temple, West Temple, North Temple, and East Temple Streets. Streets are named according to their distance and direction from the southeast corner of Temple Square; for example 200 West is two blocks west of this meridian, while 400 South is four blocks south. East Temple was popularly known as Main Street, and was officially renamed sometime in the late 19th century. It remains as the commercial and economic center of the city today.

===Main Street===

The early Mormon pioneers, who originally settled in Salt Lake City, adopted a form of consecration whereby crops grown and products produced were divided among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in local congregations. This enabled new settlers to have the food and products they needed after they made the rigorous journey to Salt Lake City. This exchange was eventually organized into what would become Zions Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI).

The first businesses to locate on Main Street were those founded by James A. Livingston and Charles A. Kincade, in 1850, in the area south of the Council House that was being built on the corner of Main and South Temple Streets. The Mormon pioneers lived a very secluded existence in the remote Salt Lake Valley for the first 20 years of settlement, beginning construction of the Salt Lake Temple and other monuments like the Salt Lake Theatre. However, in 1865 U.S. troops stationed in Park City discovered silver and announced it to the world.

With this announcement, an entirely new element began streaming into Salt Lake City. Prospectors completely changed the downtown district. In accommodation of the new crowd, many of the Main Street businesses were saloons, earning the street the nickname &quot;Whiskey Street&quot;.

For many years, there existed a political and cultural divide in Salt Lake City. Mormons would mostly shop and congregate around the Salt Lake Temple, the Gardens at Temple Square and ZCMI on the north-end of Main Street, and those who were not members of the church, who were mostly prospectors in the early days, would stay south of the predominantly Mormon area. This divide still can be felt to the present day, particularly on weekend evenings when the businesses on the north side of downtown close their doors early while the bars and restaurants on the south end of downtown host crowds late into the night.

Originally, the business district extended along the west side of Main between South Temple and 100 South. By the 1880s, the area had expanded to both sides of the street and down to 200 South, and increased about a block a decade, until 1900, when it reached 400 South. Today, the southern limit of downtown Salt Lake City is usually considered to be 900 South.

===Commercial Street===

From 1870 to the 1930s, Commercial Street (Now known as &quot;Regent Street&quot;) was Salt Lake&#x27;s notorious red light district. Prostitution was begrudgingly tolerated as long as it was confined to Commercial Street. But prostitution continued beyond Commercial Street in brothels in other areas as well such as Plum Alley, which was Salt Lake City&#x27;s China Town. In the late 1880s, the trade was unofficially licensed. Police would &quot;arrest&quot; all of the prostitutes and their madams each month and &quot;fine&quot; them $50 each. After a physical examination, they would be released and allowed to ply their trade without any further fear of molestation.
Many notable Salt Lakers owned buildings on Commercial Street, including the Brigham Young Trust Company, whose board included many prominent members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Brigham Young, Jr., then a church Apostle and vice president of the bank, temporarily resigned over the matter, until the building was later sold.


===20th century===
Salt Lake City boomed in the years before World War I and the center of mass of downtown was pulled southward by the efforts of Samuel Newhouse and other non-LDS community members. The Exchange Place Historic District encompasses the surviving structures from this era. In 1912, at the intersection of Main Street and 200 South, police officer Lester Wire installed his homemade electric traffic light, the first of its kind in the world. Salt Lake had an extensive streetcar network at the time and Trolley Square served as its main depot for years before the gradual removal of the system that came with the rise of the automobile. Though the trolley system itself is now long gone, Trolley Square remains as a noteworthy example of adaptive reuse and houses a museum dedicated to the history of the city&#x27;s streetcars.

After World War II, many people could afford to move out of downtown into the suburbs. By 1971, 60% of the homes in downtown Salt Lake City were in major disrepair. Starting in the 1960s, revitalization efforts began, spearheaded by the LDS Church, which had always considered downtown its home. During the &#x27;70s, the Church built the ZCMI Center Mall on a full city block of land that had previously housed the ZCMI department store, preserving the historic storefront. The Church also leased land to a developer to build Crossroads Plaza Mall. The land for the mall originally housed the Amussen Jewelry building (1869), at the time Salt Lake City&#x27;s oldest building. A study commissioned by the city found it to be Salt Lake City&#x27;s most architecturally significant building, and efforts to preserve it were underway. However, before the building could be saved, it was torn down to make way for the mall. Many historic buildings were lost to urban renewal during this era, the most notable of which was the Dooly Building, built in 1892 and designed by Louis Sullivan. The LDS Church Office Building was completed in 1973 and became Salt Lake&#x27;s tallest building at 28 floors and 420 ft tall. Contrary to a popular local legend, there is no formal restriction that prevents buildings from being built taller than the Church Office Building.

From 1970 to 1976 the Central Main Street shopping district saw a dramatic shift from the South-end (near Exchange Place and Broadway) to the North-end (near the L.D.S Temple). This shift was the result of a change in buying patterns, with shoppers preferring malls rather than on-street department stores. Using land and a loan provided by Zion Securities, the second Main Street mall was completed in 1978. Following the completion of the Crossroads Mall, the south-end of Main Street collapsed, beginning with 117-year-old merchant Auerbachs Department Store. Others to go under were Broadway Music, Paris Company, Baker Shoes, Pembroke&#x27;s, Keith O&#x27;Brien and Keith Warshaw.

In the 1980s, a Saudi businessman, Adnan Khashoggi, had a vision of turning Salt Lake City into a major business hub. Forming a U.S. holdings company, &quot;Triad Utah&quot;, he planned to build two 43-story skyscrapers, as well as several mid-rise buildings at the Triad Center. Khashoggi was implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal and his assets were frozen by the Federal government and the skyscrapers were never built, leaving the current Triad Center with only buildings 3, 4 and 5. Revitalization efforts of downtown continued through the 1980s and 1990s, with noteworthy projects that included the demolition of the Hotel Newhouse in 1983 and the redevelopment of Block 57 into the Gallivan Center and One Utah Center in 1991–1992. In 1985, the Radisson Hotel Salt Lake City Downtown was completed.

The Salt Palace arena, home of the Utah Jazz, was torn down and a new arena, the Delta Center (Vivint Arena), was constructed to the northwest in 1991 with the leadership of Larry H. Miller. The existing convention center connected to the arena was also demolished and a new convention center of the same name was built on the site. In 1998, the American Stores Tower (Wells Fargo Center) was completed and remained the tallest building in Salt Lake City by two feet until the Astra Tower was completed in 2024. The LDS Church Office Building appears taller from a distance because it stands on higher ground. In 2000, the LDS Conference Center was completed and supplanted the still-existing Salt Lake Tabernacle for conferences of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

===21st century===

Downtown took center stage in the 2002 Winter Olympics, hosted by Salt Lake City, and there were efforts to beautify the city and improve transit options for visitors. The Gateway, a large outdoor, pedestrian-oriented mall, was built around the historic Union Pacific Depot and hosts the Salt Lake Olympic Plaza. The TRAX light rail system was built in the years leading up to the Olympics and directly connects downtown to the University of Utah, Salt Lake International Airport, and many of the suburbs including South Salt Lake, West Valley City, Murray, and Draper.

In 2004, Ensign College, formerly known as LDS Business College, and the BYU Salt Lake Center moved downtown to the Triad Center, which was purchased by the LDS Church.

The construction of the $1.5 billion mixed-use City Creek Center from 2006 to 2012, which covers across three city blocks, marked a significant step toward bringing business interest and pedestrian activity back to downtown. The development included nearly of retail space, new and refurbished office towers, new residential buildings, and a full-service grocery store.

In 2016, a new Broadway-style theatre, the 2,468-seat Eccles Theatre, and a connected 24-story office building, 111 Main, were completed one block south. Downtown is now seeing an &quot;unprecedented&quot; level of real estate development, with multiple large towers under construction despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and has more than 5,000 residential units either planned or under construction as of April 2021. This includes the forthcoming construction of the new tallest building in Utah, the Astra Tower, which will stand 39-stories tall.

==Crime==
Pioneer Park, on the western edge of downtown, developed a reputation as one of the most crime-ridden areas of the state, and as having a large number of drug dealers. During a six-day crackdown in early November, 2007, 658 people were arrested in and around the park, approximately 70% of all arrests made in the city during that time period in an area that takes up just 1% of Salt Lake City. Pioneer Park was completely renovated in early 2008 following several severe assault incidents. After the controversial Operation Rio Grande, which began in 2017, and the closure and demolition of the Road Home homeless shelter in 2019 and 2020, respectively, the Pioneer Park area has begun to see a dramatic reduction in crime and a resulting trend of gentrification.

<text>The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is part of the New Zealand National War Memorial on Buckle Street, Wellington.

On 6 November 2004, the remains of an unknown New Zealand soldier were exhumed from the (CWGC) Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, and laid to rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Wellington, New Zealand. He represents over 18,000 members of New Zealand forces who lost their lives during the First World War. A special headstone marks his original resting place in Plot 14, Row A, Grave 27.

==History==
On 6 November 2004 the remains, in a copper coffin sealed and placed in a rimu coffin brought from New Zealand, were handed over from the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to a New Zealand delegation during a ceremony at Longueval, Somme, France. New Zealand Defence Force chief, Air Marshal Bruce Ferguson, who had the task of repatriating the Warrior&#x27;s remains, said of the occasion &quot;I told him [the Warrior] we&#x27;re taking him home and that those who are taking him home are soldiers, sailors and airmen, past and present. I asked the Warrior to be the guardian of all military personnel who had died on active service. I then promised that we, the people of New Zealand, will be his guardian for ever&quot;.

The Warrior arrived in New Zealand on 10 November 2004. While he lay in state in the Parliament Buildings an estimated 10,000 people paid their respects. The Warrior was laid to rest on the 86th Armistice Day, 11 November 2004, after a service at St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral and a 2.85 km slow march procession through the streets of Wellington, lined by about 100,000 people. The Tomb was sealed with a bronze mantel at 3:59pm, bearing the words:&lt;br&gt;
The Warrior is one of more than 1500 New Zealanders killed on the Somme. Most of them, 1272, remained unidentified and are buried in unmarked graves or remembered on memorial walls. The remains are thought to include an almost complete skeleton, and other belongings that established beyond doubt the Warrior&#x27;s nationality.

==Awards==
The Warrior was awarded:
* 1914–15 Star for service between August 1914 and December 1915
* British War Medal for service during World War I up to 1920
* Victory Medal
* 1939–1945 Star for service during World War II
* New Zealand Operational Service Medal

The Royal New Zealand Returned and Services&#x27; Association also awarded its Badge in Gold, the first time it has been awarded posthumously. Immediate Past National President David Cox, a World War II veteran, made the presentation:

Each RNZRSA District President placed soil and other items into the Tomb to acknowledge the service personnel from their districts who had given their lives to the nation, including soil from the farm of Charles Upham. Soil from Caterpillar Valley Cemetery was provided by the Ambassador from France, Jean-Michel Marlaud.

<doc id="1146163" wikidata="Q131764" url="?curid=1146163" title="Cunoniaceae">
<text>Cunoniaceae is a family of 27 genera and about 335 species of woody plants in the order Oxalidales, mostly found in the tropical and wet temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere.
The greatest diversity of genera are in Australia and Tasmania (15 genera), New Guinea (9 genera), and New Caledonia (7 genera). The family is also present in Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Malesia, the islands of the South Pacific, Madagascar and surrounding islands. The family is absent from mainland Asia except from Peninsular Malaysia, and almost absent from mainland Africa apart from two species from Southern Africa (&quot;Cunonia capensis&quot;, &quot;Platylophus trifoliatus&quot;). Several of the genera have remarkable disjunct ranges, found on more than one continent, e.g. &quot;Cunonia&quot; (Southern Africa &amp; New Caledonia), &quot;Eucryphia&quot; (Australia &amp; South America) &quot;Weinmannia&quot; (America and the Mascarenes).

The family includes trees and shrubs; most are evergreen but a few are deciduous. The leaves are opposite or whorled (alternate in &quot;Davidsonia&quot;), and simple or compound (pinnate or palmate), with entire or toothed margin, and often with conspicuous stipules (interpetiolar or intrapetiolar). The flowers have four or five (rarely three or up to ten) sepals and petals. The fruit is usually a woody capsule or a follicle containing several small seeds.

The family has a rich fossil record in Australia and fossil representatives are known in the Northern Hemisphere. &quot;Platydiscus peltatus&quot; was found in Upper Cretaceous rocks from Sweden and is likely a member of the Cunoniaceae. An earlier possible fossil member is from the Cenomanian. &quot;Tropidogyne&quot;, found in Burmese amber, has flowers that strongly resemble the extant &quot;Ceratopetalum&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genera of the family have been divided into tribes.

<doc id="1146168" wikidata="Q6483685" url="?curid=1146168" title="Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties">
<text>&quot;The Lancet&quot;, one of the oldest scientific medical journals in the world, published two peer-reviewed studies on the effect of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation on the Iraqi mortality rate. The first was published in 2004; the second (by many of the same authors) in 2006. The studies estimate the number of excess deaths caused by the occupation, both direct (combatants plus non-combatants) and indirect (due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poor healthcare, etc.).

The first survey published on 29 October 2004, estimated 98,000 excess Iraqi deaths (with a range of 8,000 to 194,000, using a 95% confidence interval (CI)) from the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq to that time, or about 50% higher than the death rate prior to the invasion. The authors described this as a conservative estimate, because it excluded the extreme statistical outlier data from Fallujah. If the Fallujah cluster were included, the mortality estimate would increase to 150% over pre-invasion rates (95% CI: 1.6 to 4.2).

The second survey published on 11 October 2006, estimated 654,965 excess deaths related to the war, or 2.5% of the population, through the end of June 2006. The new study applied similar methods and involved surveys between 20 May and 10 July 2006. More households were surveyed, allowing for a 95% confidence interval of 392,979 to 942,636 excess Iraqi deaths. 601,027 deaths (range of 426,369 to 793,663 using a 95% confidence interval) were due to violence. 31% (186,318) of those were attributed to the US-led Coalition, 24% (144,246) to others, and 46% (276,472) unknown. The causes of violent deaths were gunshot (56% or 336,575), car bomb (13% or 78,133), other explosion/ordnance (14%), air strike (13% or 78,133), accident (2% or 12,020), and unknown (2%).

The mortality estimates in the &quot;Lancet&quot; surveys are higher than in several other reports, including those of the Iraqi Health Ministry and the United Nations, as well as other household surveys such as the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and the Iraq Family Health Survey. The 2007 ORB survey of Iraq War casualties estimated more deaths than the Lancet, though it covered a longer period of the conflict. The &quot;Lancet&quot; surveys have been supported by some journalists, governments, epidemiologists and statisticians, and been met by criticism and disbelief from other journalists, governments, epidemiologists and statisticians.

== First study (2004) ==
The survey was sponsored by the Center for International Emergency Disaster and Refugee Studies, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States (authors L Roberts PhD, G Burnham MD) and the Department of Community Medicine, College of Medicine, Al-Mustansiriya University, Baghdad, Iraq. Roberts&#x27; team was chosen for their experience in estimating total mortality in war zones, for example his estimate of 1.7 million deaths due to the war in the Congo which not only met with widespread acceptance and no challenge when published in 2000, but resulted and was cited in a U.N. Security Council resolution that all foreign armies must leave Congo, a United Nations request for $140 million in aid, and the US State Department pledging an additional $10 million in aid. Similar studies have been accepted uncritically as estimates of wartime mortality in Darfur and Bosnia.

Roberts&#x27; regular technique is to estimate total mortality by personal surveys of a sample of the households in the area under study; this method being chosen in order to avoid the under-counting inherent in using only reported deaths in areas so chaotic that many deaths are unreported, and to include those deaths not directly attributable to violence but nevertheless the result of the conflict through indirect means, such as contamination of water supply or unavailability of medical care. The baseline mortality rate calculated from the interviewees&#x27; reports for the period prior to the conflict is subtracted from that reported during the conflict, to estimate the excess mortality which may be attributed to the presence of the conflict, directly or indirectly. This technique has been accepted uncritically in the previous mortality surveys discussed above.

Because of the impracticality of carrying out an evenly distributed survey, particularly during a war, Roberts&#x27; surveys use &quot;cluster sampling&quot;, dividing the area into a number of randomly selected, approximately equally populated regions; a random point is chosen within each region, and a fixed number of the households closest to that point are surveyed as a &quot;cluster&quot;. While not as accurate as an evenly distributed survey of the same number of households, this technique is more accurate than merely surveying one household for each selected point.

In his study of Iraq, Roberts divided the country into 36 regions, attempting to sample 30 households for each cluster, and selecting 988 households, with 7868 residents. In September 2004, each surveyed household was interviewed about household composition, births, and deaths since January 2002. Of 78 households where members were asked to show documentation to confirm their claims after the interview was finished, 63 were able to present death certificates. According to the authors, 5 (0.5%) of the 988 households that were randomly chosen to be surveyed refused to be interviewed.

The relative risk of death due to the 2003 invasion and occupation was estimated by comparing mortality in the 17.8 months after the invasion with the 14.6 months preceding it. The authors stated, &quot;Making conservative assumptions, we think that about 100,000 excess deaths, or more have happened since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.&quot; Among such &quot;conservative assumptions&quot; is the exclusion of data from Fallujah in many of its findings. Since interpreting the results of the study would be complicated by the inclusion of an outlier cluster in Fallujah, where heavy fighting caused far more casualties than elsewhere in Iraq, the study focused mainly on the results that excluded the Fallujah cluster. While the authors argued that the Fallujah cluster&#x27;s inclusion could be justified as a normal part of the sampling strategy (the authors noted that other &quot;hotspots&quot; like Najaf had not ended up being surveyed), and the authors presented two sets of results in some cases (one set including the Fallujah data and one not), the article, and most press coverage of the article, stresses the data that excluded the Fallujah cluster.

The main debate in the media in the U.S. and UK focused on whether 98,000 (95% CI 8000–194,000) more Iraqis died as a result of coalition intervention, calculated from their estimate of an increased mortality of 1.5 times (95% CI 1.1–2.3) the prewar rate (excluding the Fallujah data). Had the Fallujah sample been included, the survey&#x27;s estimate that mortality rates had increased about 2.5 times since the invasion (with a 95% CI 1.6–4.2) including the Fallujah data would have resulted in an excess of about 298,000 deaths (95% CI ?–?), with 200,000 concentrated in the 3% of Iraq around Fallujah (Roberts et al. p. 5).

According to the article, violence was responsible for most of the extra deaths whether or not the Fallujah data was excluded. Coalition airstrikes would be the main cause of these violent deaths if Fallujah data were included. The study concluded that: &quot;Violent deaths were widespread, reported in 15 of 33 clusters, and were mainly attributed to coalition forces.&quot; and &quot;Violence accounted for most of the excess deaths and air strikes from coalition forces accounted for most violent deaths.&quot;
The study estimates that the risk of death specifically from violence in Iraq during the period after the invasion was approximately 58 times higher than in the period before the war, with the CI95 being 8.1–419, meaning that there is a 97.5% chance that the risk of death from violence after the invasion is at least 8.1 times higher than it was before.
Newsday reported:

The most common causes of death before the invasion of Iraq were heart attacks, strokes and other chronic diseases. However, after the invasion, violence was recorded as the primary cause of death and was mainly attributed to coalition forces—with about 95 percent of those deaths caused by bombs or fire from helicopter gunships.

=== Criticisms and countercriticisms ===
Some criticisms have focused on the relatively broad 95% confidence intervals (CI95), resulting from the difficulty and scarcity of reliable sources.

Lila Guterman, after writing a long article in January 2005 in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, wrote a short article in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; that stated: &quot;I called about ten biostatisticians and mortality experts. Not one of them took issue with the study&#x27;s methods or its conclusions. If anything, the scientists told me, the authors had been cautious in their estimates. With a quick call to a statistician, reporters would have found that the probability forms a bell curve—the likelihood is very small that the number of deaths fell at either extreme of the range. It was very likely to fall near the middle.&quot;

A Ministerial Statement written 17 November 2004, by the UK government stated &quot;the Government does not accept its [the study&#x27;s] central conclusion&quot;, because they were apparently inconsistent with figures published by the Iraq Ministry of Health, based on figures collected by hospitals, which said that &quot;between 5 April 2004 and 5 October 2004, 3,853 civilians were killed and 15,517 were injured&quot;.

Some critics have said that &quot;The Lancet&quot; study authors were unable to visit certain randomly selected sample areas. In an interview on the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot; however, the authors of the study say that they never substituted different, more accessible, areas, and that every place that was randomly selected at the beginning of the study was surveyed in full, despite the risk of death to the surveyors.

Critics of the &quot;Lancet&quot; study have pointed out other difficulties in obtaining accurate statistics in a war zone. The authors of the study readily acknowledge this point and note the problems in the paper; for example they state that &quot;there can be a dramatic clustering of deaths in wars where many die from bombings&quot;. They also said that the data their projections were based on were of &quot;limited precision&quot; because the quality of the information depended on the accuracy of the household interviews used for the study.

The results of the study were politically sensitive, since a heavy death toll could raise questions regarding the humanitarian justifications on the eve of a contested US presidential election. Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated &quot;I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq. I was opposed to the war and I still think that the war was a bad idea, but I think that our science has transcended our perspectives.&quot;

=== &quot;Lancet&quot; publications related to criticisms ===
* 20 November 2004. Criticism and suggestions by peer reviewer Professor Sheila Bird, MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge CB2 2SR, UK, chair of the Royal Statistical Society&#x27;s Working Party on Performance Monitoring in the Public Services. Calls scientific method &quot;generally well described and readily repeatable&quot;, but says &quot;[p]articular attention is needed to the methodology for randomly selecting the location(s) of cluster(s) within governorates. Roberts and colleagues describe this rather too succinctly&quot;. Suggests additional information be included so that more precise multipliers (to obtain the final estimate) can be applied. Discusses an example hypothetical circumstance incorporating said information, regarding airstrike deaths and collateral damage, under which over-counting could occur due to population density variances among cluster representations.
* 26 March 2005. Criticism by Stephen Apfelroth, Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Criticizes &quot;several questionable sampling techniques that should have been more thoroughly examined before publication&quot; and lists several flaws, including a &quot;fatal&quot; one, that &quot;In such a situation, multiple random sample points are required within each geographic region, not one per 739,000 individuals.&quot;
* 26 March 2005. Response by Les Roberts et al. to Apfelroth. Acknowledges flaws, but says &quot;the key public-health findings of this study are robust despite this imprecision. These findings include: a higher death rate after the invasion; a 58-fold increase in death from violence, making it the main cause of death; and most violent deaths being caused by air-strikes from Coalition Forces. Whether the true death toll is 90,000 or 150,000, these three findings give ample guidance towards understanding what must happen to reduce civilian deaths. ... Before publication, the article was critically reviewed by many leading authorities in statistics and public health and their suggestions were incorporated into the paper. The death toll estimated by our study is indeed imprecise, and those interested in international law and historical records should not be content with our study. We encourage Apfelroth and others to improve on our efforts. In the interim, we feel this study, as well as the only other published sample survey we know of on the subject, point to violence from the Coalition Forces as the main cause of death and remind us that the number of Iraqi deaths is certainly many times higher than reported by passive surveillance methods or in press accounts.&quot;

=== Other responses to criticism ===

&quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; also wrote an article discussing the differences in the survey&#x27;s reception in the popular press over how it was received in the scientific community.

Epidemiologist Klim McPherson writes in the 12 March 2005 &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;: &quot;The government rejected this survey and its estimates as unreliable; in part absurdly because statistical extrapolation from samples was thought invalid. Imprecise they are, but to a known extent. These are unique estimates from a dispassionate survey conducted in the most dangerous of epidemiological conditions. Hence the estimates, as far as they can go, are unlikely to be biased, even allowing for the reinstatement of Falluja. To confuse imprecision with bias is unjustified.&quot;

== Second study (2006) ==

A second study by some of the same authors was published in October 2006, in &quot;The Lancet&quot;.

We estimate that between March 18, 2003, and June, 2006, an additional 654,965 (392,979–942,636) Iraqis have died above what would have been expected on the basis of the pre-invasion crude mortality rate as a consequence of the coalition invasion. Of these deaths, we estimate that 601,027 (426,369–793,663) were due to violence.

If accurate, these figures would imply the death of an average 500 people per day, or 2.5% of Iraq&#x27;s population during the period.

An 11 October 2006 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article reports:

The survey was conducted between May 20 and July 10 [2006] by eight Iraqi physicians organized through Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. They visited 1,849 randomly selected households that had an average of seven members each. One person in each household was asked about deaths in the 14 months before the invasion and in the period after. The interviewers asked for death certificates 87 percent of the time; when they did, more than 90 percent of households produced certificates.

Lancet:

Only 47 of the sought 50 clusters were included in this analysis. On two occasions, miscommunication resulted in clusters not being visited in Muthanna and Dahuk, and instead being included in other Governorates. In Wassit, insecurity caused the team to choose the next nearest population area, in accordance with the study protocol. Later it was discovered that this second site was actually across the boundary in Baghdad Governorate. These three misattributed clusters were therefore excluded, leaving a final sample of 1849 households in 47 randomly selected clusters.

The &quot;Lancet&quot; authors based their calculations on an overall, post-invasion, excess mortality rate of 7.8/1000/year. &quot;Pre-invasion mortality rates were 5.5 per 1000 people per year (95% CI 4.3–7.1), compared with 13.3 per 1000 people per year (10.9–16.1) in the 40 months post-invasion.&quot; See Table 3 in the &quot;Lancet&quot; article. The population number used in the calculation is reported in the &quot;Lancet&quot; supplement: &quot;Mortality projections were applied to the 2004 mid-year population estimates (26,112,353) of the surveyed areas (which exclude the governorates of Muthanna and Dahuk, which had been omitted through misattribution) to establish the mortality projections.&quot;

Of 629 deaths verified and recorded among a sample of 1,849 households incorporating some 12,801 people at the time of the survey, 13% took place in the 14 months before the invasion and 87% in the 40 months afterwards. &quot;The study population at the beginning of the recall period (January 1, 2002) was calculated to be 11 956, and a total of 1474 births and 629 deaths were reported during the study period.&quot;

The study concluded that the mortality rate per 1,000 population per year in the pre-invasion period was 5.5 (range of 4.3–7.1, using a 95% CI, confidence interval) and in the post-invasion period was 13.3 (95% CI, 10.9–16.1). Excess mortality rate over the pre-invasion period was therefore 7.8 per 1,000 population per year, with violent death accounting for 92% of the increased mortality rate.

&quot;Washington Post&quot;: &quot;Gunshot wounds caused 56 percent of violent deaths, with car bombs and other explosions causing 14 percent, according to the survey results. Of the violent deaths that occurred after the invasion, 31 percent were caused by coalition forces or airstrikes, the respondents said.&quot;

The study results show an increasing mortality rate throughout the post-invasion periods, with the excess mortality rate for June 2005–June 2006 of 14.2 (95% CI, 8.6–21.5) being nearly 5.5 times the excess mortality rate for March 2003–April 2004 of 2.6 (95% CI, 0.6–4.7). The 2006 study also provides an estimate for the 18-month period following the invasion (March 2003 through September 2004) of 112,000 deaths (95% CI, 69,000–155,000). The authors conclude, &quot;Thus, the data presented here validates our 2004 study, which conservatively estimated an excess mortality of nearly 100,000 as of September, 2004.&quot;

The authors described the fact that their estimate is over ten times higher than other estimates, such as the Iraq Body Count project (IBC) estimate and U.S. Department of Defense estimates, as &quot;not unexpected&quot;, stating that this is a common occurrence in conflict situations. They stated, &quot;Aside from Bosnia, we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods. In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates. Between 1960 and 1990, newspaper accounts of political deaths in Guatemala correctly reported over 50% of deaths in years of low violence but less than 5% in years of highest violence.&quot;

=== Official reactions ===

A 12 October 2006 &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article reported:
&quot;Six hundred thousand or whatever they guessed at is just, it&#x27;s not credible,&quot; Bush said, and he dismissed the methodology as &quot;pretty well discredited.&quot; In December [2005], Bush estimated that 30,000 Iraqis had died in the war. Asked at the news conference what he thinks the number is now, Bush said: &quot;I stand by the figure a lot of innocent people have lost their life.&quot; At a separate Pentagon briefing, Gen. George Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, said that the figure &quot;seems way, way beyond any number that I have seen. I&#x27;ve not seen a number higher than 50,000. And so I don&#x27;t give it that much credibility at all.&quot;

The UK government, too, rejected the researchers&#x27; conclusions. In doing so, it did not mention the advice of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Roy Anderson, who had called the study &quot;robust&quot; and its claimed methods &quot;close to &#x27;best practice&#x27; in this area, given the difficulties of data collection and verification in the present circumstances in Iraq&quot;, in an internal memo on the day the study was published, dated 13 October 2006.

=== Criticisms ===

The Iraq Body Count project (IBC), who compiles a database of reported civilian deaths, has criticised the Lancet&#x27;s estimate of 601,000 violent deaths out of the Lancet estimate of 654,965 total excess deaths related to the war. An October 2006 article by IBC argues that the &quot;Lancet&quot; estimate is suspect &quot;because of a very different conclusion reached by another random household survey, the Iraq Living Conditions Survey 2004 (ILCS), using a comparable method but a considerably better-distributed and much larger sample.&quot; IBC also enumerates several &quot;shocking implications&quot; which would be true if the &quot;Lancet&quot; report were accurate, e.g. &quot;Half a million death certificates were received by families which were never officially recorded as having been issued&quot; and claims that these &quot;extreme and improbable implications&quot; and &quot;utter failure of local or external agencies to notice and respond to a decimation of the adult male population in key urban areas&quot; are some of several reasons why they doubt the study&#x27;s estimates. IBC states that these consequences would constitute &quot;extreme notions&quot;. Later statements in a 2010 article by IBC say that the &quot;hugely exaggerated death toll figures&quot; from the 2006 Lancet report have &quot;been comprehensively discredited&quot; by recently published research.

Jon Pedersen of the Fafo Institute and research director for the ILCS survey, which estimated approximately 24,000 (95% CI 18,000–29,000) war-related deaths in Iraq up to April 2004, expressed reservations about the low pre-war mortality rate used in the Lancet study and about the ability of its authors to oversee the interviews properly as they were conducted throughout Iraq. Pedersen has been quoted saying he thinks the Lancet numbers are &quot;high, and probably way too high. I would accept something in the vicinity of 100,000 but 600,000 is too much.&quot;

Debarati Guha-Sapir, director of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, was quoted in an interview for Nature.com saying that Burnham&#x27;s team have published &quot;inflated&quot; numbers that &quot;discredit&quot; the process of estimating death counts. &quot;Why are they doing this?&quot; she asks. &quot;It&#x27;s because of the elections.&quot;. However, another interviewer a week later paints a more measured picture of her criticisms: &quot;She has some methodological concerns about the paper, including the use of local people—who might have opposed the occupation—as interviewers. She also points out that the result does not fit with any she has recorded in 15 years of studying conflict zones. Even in Darfur, where armed groups have wiped out whole villages, she says that researchers have not recorded the 500 violent deaths per day that the Johns Hopkins team estimates are occurring in Iraq. But overall Guha-Sapir says the paper contains the best data yet on the mortality rate in Iraq.&quot; A subsequent article co-authored by Guha-Sapir and Olivier Degomme for CRED reviews the &quot;Lancet&quot; data in detail. It concludes that &quot;The Lancet&quot; overestimated deaths and that the war-related death toll was most likely to be around 125,000 for the period covered by the &quot;Lancet&quot; study, reaching its conclusions by correcting errors in the 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; estimate and triangulating with data from IBC and ILCS.

Beth Osborne Daponte, a demographer known for producing death estimates for the first Gulf War, evaluates the Lancet survey and other sources in a paper for the International Review of the Red Cross. Among other criticisms, Daponte questions the reliability of pre-war estimates used in the Lancet study to derive its &quot;excess deaths&quot; estimate, and the ethical approval for the survey. She concludes that the most reliable information available to date is provided by the Iraq Family Health Survey, the Iraq Living Conditions Survey and Iraq Body Count.

Borzou Daragahi Iraq correspondent for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in an interview with PBS, questioned the study based on their earlier research in Iraq, saying, &quot;Well, we think—the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; thinks these numbers are too large, depending on the extensive research we&#x27;ve done. Earlier this year, around June, the report was published at least in June, but the reporting was done over weeks earlier. We went to morgues, cemeteries, hospitals, health officials, and we gathered as many statistics as we could on the actual dead bodies, and the number we came up with around June was about at least 50,000. And that kind of jibed with some of the news report that were out there, the accumulation of news reports, in terms of the numbers killed. The U.N. says that there&#x27;s about 3,000 a month being killed; that also fits in with our numbers and with morgue numbers. This number of 600,000 or more killed since the beginning of the war, it&#x27;s way off our charts.&quot;

The October 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; estimate also drew criticism from the Iraqi government. Government spokesman Ali Debbagh said, &quot;This figure, which in reality has no basis, is exaggerated&quot;. Iraq&#x27;s Health Minister Ali al-Shemari gave a similar view in November 2006: &quot;Since three and a half years, since the change of the Saddam regime, some people say we have 600,000 are killed. This is an exaggerated number. I think 150 is OK.&quot;

A 2010 paper by Professor Michael Spagat entitled &quot;Ethical and Data-Integrity Problems in the Second Lancet Survey of Mortality in Iraq&quot; was published in the peer reviewed journal &quot;Defense &amp; Peace Economics&quot;. This paper argues that there were several &quot;ethical violations to the survey&#x27;s respondents&quot;, faults the study authors for &quot;non-disclosure of the survey&#x27;s questionnaire, data-entry form, data matching anonymised interviewer identifications with households and sample design&quot;, and presents &quot;evidence relating to data fabrication and falsification, which falls into nine broad categories.&quot; The paper concludes that the Lancet survey, &quot;cannot be considered a reliable or valid contribution towards knowledge about the extent of mortality in Iraq since 2003.&quot;

=== AAPOR investigation of the 2nd &quot;Lancet&quot; survey ===

On 3 February 2009, the Executive Council of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) announced that an 8-month investigation found the author of the 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; survey, Dr. Gilbert Burnham, had violated the Association&#x27;s Code of Professional Ethics &amp; Practices for repeatedly refusing to disclose essential facts about his research. &quot;Dr. Burnham provided only partial information and explicitly refused to provide complete information about the basic elements of his research,&quot; said Mary Losch, chair of the association&#x27;s Standards Committee.
AAPOR&#x27;s President, Richard A. Kulka, added:

When researchers draw important conclusions and make public statements and arguments based on survey research data, then subsequently refuse to answer even basic questions about how their research was conducted, this violates the fundamental standards of science, seriously undermines open public debate on critical issues, and undermines the credibility of all survey and public opinion research. These concerns have been at the foundation of AAPOR&#x27;s standards and professional code throughout our history, and when these principles have clearly been violated, making the public aware of these violations is in integral part of our mission and values as a professional organization.

AAPOR subsequently released a more detailed list of eight specific pieces of information Burnham failed to disclose after repeated requests. These include a copy of the survey questionnaire in all languages into which it was translated, the consent statement, information of sample selection methodology and a summary of the disposition of all sample cases.

Neither Dr. Burnham nor the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health are members of AAPOR. Tim Parsons, public affairs director of the Bloomberg School wrote in an official statement that the school was &quot;not in a position to comment&quot; on AAPOR&#x27;s findings because the school is not a member of the organisation and &quot;does not know what procedures or standards were followed in reaching the decision regarding this study.&quot; Parsons also noted that the school was nearing completion of its own investigation into the study.

At least one article has been written critical of AAPOR&#x27;s decision to censure Burnham. Debora MacKenzie, writing in &quot;New Scientist&quot;, said &quot;There is no direct evidence that the latest attack on Burnham is politically motivated,&quot; but the APPOR&#x27;s stated purpose, &quot;to ensure survey-based research meets high standards,&quot; has itself &quot;been questioned by experts.&quot; which MacKnenzie does not name.

According to &quot;New Scientist&#x27;s&quot; investigation... Burnham has sent his data and methods to other researchers, who found it sufficient. A spokesman for the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins, where Burnham works, says the school advised him not to send his data to AAPOR, as the group has no authority to judge the research. The &quot;correct forum&quot;, it says, is the scientific literature.

According to MacKenzie, &quot;Burnham&#x27;s complete data, including details of households, is available to bona fide researchers on request.&quot; She further noted that the AAPOR&#x27;s own journal, &quot;Public Opinion Quarterly&quot;, &quot;published an analysis of Burnham&#x27;s Iraq survey by David Marker of Westat, a consultancy in Maryland that designs surveys.&quot;

The American Statistical Association has subsequently written in support of the actions taken by AAPOR, saying:

We are aware that, in taking this action, you have subjected yourselves to some criticism. On behalf of the American Statistical Association, we wish to recognize AAPOR for following procedure and acting professionally on such a difficult and divisive matter. In so doing, you eloquently express by your actions the goals stated in your Code.

On 1 February 2010, The Bloomberg School and Dr. Burnham were named for the

STONEWALLING/COVERUP&quot; award in iMediaEthics&#x27; 2010 Top Ten &quot;Dubious Polling&quot; Awards, based largely on the AAPOR censure. The authors David W. Moore and George F. Bishop, write that Bloomberg and Burnham received the award, &quot;for stonewalling in the face of serious questions about a flawed survey project, which reported more than 600,000 Iraqi deaths from 2003 to 2006,&quot; saying, &quot;AAPOR asked for the kind of information that any scientist doing this type of work should release ... The Bloomberg School will not attempt to evaluate what experts believe is almost certainly a faulty methodology, saying the scientific community should make the evaluation. But then the school advises Burnham not to release details about his methods, so the scientific community can&#x27;t have the information it needs for a definitive assessment. Sounds like a cop-out and a Catch 22, all rolled into one!

=== Johns Hopkins Investigation of the 2nd &quot;Lancet&quot; survey ===

In February 2009 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health published the results of an internal review of the study. The review found that researchers in the field used data collection forms that were different from those approved in the original protocol. The forms used in the field contained spaces for names of respondents or householders and many such names were collected, in violation of the protocol. The press release said the review did not find evidence that any individual was harmed as a result of these violations, and that no identifiable info was ever out of the possession of the researchers. As a result of their investigation, Hopkins suspended Dr. Burnham&#x27;s privileges to serve as a principal investigator on projects involving human subjects research.

The press release also discussed an examination of all the original data collection forms:

An examination was conducted of all the original data collection forms, numbering over 1,800 forms, which included review by a translator. The original forms have the appearance of authenticity in variation of handwriting, language and manner of completion. The information contained on the forms was validated against the two numerical databases used in the study analyses. These numerical databases have been available to outside researchers and provided to them upon request since April 2007. Some minor, ordinary errors in transcription were detected, but they were not of variables that affected the study&#x27;s primary mortality analysis or causes of death. The review concluded that the data files used in the study accurately reflect the information collected on the original field surveys.

=== Number of clusters ===

Steven E. Moore, who conducted survey research in Iraq for the Coalition Provisional Authority and was an advisor to Paul Bremer for the International Republican Institute, ridiculed the &quot;Lancet&quot; study in an 18 October 2006 editorial in the &quot;Wall Street Journal.&quot; In a piece entitled, &quot;655,000 War Dead? A bogus study on Iraq casualties&quot;, Moore wrote, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t survey a junior high school, no less an entire country, using only 47 cluster points. Neither would anyone else...&quot;

Gilbert Burnham replied on 20 October 2006:

Mr. Moore did not question our methodology, but rather the number of clusters we used to develop a representative sample. Our study used 47 randomly selected clusters of 40 households each. In his critique, Mr. Moore did not note that our survey sample included 12,801 people living in 47 clusters, which is the equivalent to a survey of 3,700 randomly selected individuals. As a comparison, a 3,700-person survey is nearly 3 times larger than the average U.S. political survey that reports a margin of error of +/-3%.
=== Pre-invasion death rate ===

Fred Kaplan, writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, has criticised the pre-invasion death rate used in both the 2004 and 2006 Lancet surveys.

In an 29 October 2004 article in &quot;Slate&quot; he wrote:

But there are two problems with this calculation. First, Daponte (who has studied Iraqi population figures for many years) questions the finding that prewar mortality was 5 deaths per 1,000. According to quite comprehensive data collected by the United Nations, Iraq&#x27;s mortality rate from 1980–85 was 8.1 per 1,000. From 1985–90, the years leading up to the 1991 Gulf War, the rate declined to 6.8 per 1,000. After &#x27;91, the numbers are murkier, but clearly they went up. Whatever they were in 2002, they were almost certainly higher than 5 per 1,000.

See also a related article about Beth Daponte:

In an 20 October 2006 &quot;Slate&quot; article Fred Kaplan wrote that the pre-invasion death rate calculated by the 2006 Lancet report authors was also too low. This he said would cause the &quot;Lancet&quot; estimate of excess deaths since the invasion to be too high. Fred Kaplan wrote:

Based on the household surveys, the report estimates that, just before the war, Iraq&#x27;s mortality rate was 5.5 per 1,000. (That is, for every 1,000 people, 5.5 die each year.) The results also show that, in the three and a half years since the war began, this rate has shot up to 13.3 per 1,000. So, the &#x27;excess deaths&#x27; amount to 7.8 (13.3 minus 5.5) per 1,000. They extrapolate from this figure to reach their estimate of 655,000 deaths. However, according to data from the United Nations, based on surveys taken at the time, Iraq&#x27;s preinvasion mortality rate was 10 per 1,000.

In a 20 November 2006 &quot;Slate&quot; article, 2 of the &quot;Lancet&quot; study authors, Gilbert Burnham and Les Roberts, write:

Kaplan claims that the rate was really 10, according to U.N. figures. He wrote, &#x27;[I]f Iraq&#x27;s pre-invasion rate really was 5.5 per 1,000, it was lower than almost every country in the Middle East, and many countries in Europe.&#x27; This is just wrong! If Kaplan had checked the U.N. death-rate figures, most Middle Eastern nations really do have lower death rates than most European countries, and in fact have lower death rates than 5.5. Jordan&#x27;s death rate is 4.2, Iran&#x27;s 5.3, and Syria&#x27;s 3.5. The reason for the lower rate is simple: Most Middle Eastern nations have much younger populations compared to most Western nations.

From a 19 October 2006 Washington Post article there is this:

In a telephone interview, Jon Pedersen, research director for the 2004 [UNDP] study, said several factors probably account for researchers&#x27; different findings. One key issue is how researchers extrapolate from the deaths identified in their field research to a death toll for the whole country. Pedersen noted that the Lancet study is based on a pre-invasion mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per thousand people [per year]. The U.N., he said, used the figure of 9 deaths per thousand. Extrapolating from the lower pre-invasion mortality rate would yield a greater increase in post-invasion deaths, he noted.

The above-mentioned U.N. &quot;pre-invasion mortality rate&quot; of 9 deaths/1,000/year is more than either the 2002 or 2003 mortality rates measured by both Lancet studies.

Even though the 2004 and 2006 Lancet studies interviewed different sets of households across Iraq, they came up with the same 2002 pre-war mortality rate. From the 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; article: &quot;The striking similarity between the 2004 and 2006 estimates of pre-war mortality diminishes concerns about people&#x27;s ability to recall deaths accurately over a 4-year period.&quot;

Here is an excerpt from the supplement to the 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study:

For the purpose of analysis, the 40 months of survey data were divided into three equal periods—March 2003 to April 2004; May 2004 to May 2005, and June 2005 to June 2006. Following the invasion the death rate rose each year.
* &quot;Pre-invasion: 5.5 deaths/1,000/year
* March 2003–April 2004: 7.5 deaths/1,000/year
* May 2004–May 2005: 10.9 deaths/1,000/year
* June 2005–June 2006: 19.8 deaths/1,000/year
* Overall post-invasion: 13.2 deaths/1,000/year

The difference between the pre-invasion mortality rate and the different mortality rates after the invasion are the excess mortality rates for each period. Table 3 in the &quot;Lancet&quot; article lists those rates as 2.6, 5.6, and 14.2. Why the excess mortality rate for June 2005 to June 2006 is listed as 14.2 instead of 14.3 May be due to how rounding was done. The overall excess mortality rate for the whole post-invasion survey period is listed as 7.8 deaths/1000/year in Table 3.

The difference between the &quot;Lancet&quot; and U.N. pre-invasion mortality rates is 3.5 deaths/1,000/year. The Lancet study used the number of 26,112,353 (from Lancet supplement) as the population of Iraq. 3.5 times 26,112 equals 91,392. So 3.5 deaths/1,000/year means around 91,400 deaths in one year in a population of 26.1 million.

=== Infant and child death rates ===

In a 5 March 2007 article in &quot;The Times&quot;, economist Michael Spagat says there is a perplexing finding in the 2006 Lancet report that child deaths have fallen.

A 25 May 2000 BBC article reported that before Iraq sanctions were imposed by the UN in 1990, infant mortality had &quot;fallen to 47 per 1,000 live births between 1984 and 1989. This compares to approximately 7 per 1,000 in the UK.&quot; The BBC article was reporting from a study of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, titled &quot;Sanctions and childhood mortality in Iraq&quot;, that was published in the May 2000 &quot;Lancet&quot; medical journal.

The 2000 BBC article reported that after the UN sanctions were imposed after Iraq&#x27;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait, &quot;They found that in south and central Iraq, infant mortality had risen to 108 per 1,000 between 1994 and 1999, while child mortality—covering those between one and five years—rocketed from 56 to 131 per 1,000.&quot;

The 2000 BBC article also reported, &quot;However, it found that infant and child mortality in the autonomous, mainly Kurd region in the North of the country, has actually fallen, perhaps reflecting the more favourable distribution of aid in that area.&quot;

UN-sponsored studies taken after 2003 revealed that the previous childhood mortality figures for South/Central Iraq (supplied by Saddam&#x27;s government) were inflated by more than a factor of two and that the childhood mortality rate in those regions was even lower than the rate in northern Iraq.

The UN sanctions ended on 22 May 2003 (with certain arms-related exceptions).

=== 40 houses surveyed per day ===

Madelyn Hicks, a psychiatrist and public health researcher at King&#x27;s College London in the UK, says she &quot;simply cannot believe&quot; the paper&#x27;s claim that 40 consecutive houses were surveyed in a single day. &quot;There is simply not enough time in the day,&quot; she says, &quot;so I have to conclude that something else is going on for at least some of these interviews.&quot; Households may have been &quot;prepared by someone, made ready for rapid reporting,&quot; she says, which &quot;raises the issue of bias being introduced.&quot;

An 24 October 2006 &quot;The Guardian&quot; article reports this response from &quot;Lancet&quot; study author Gilbert Burnham:

Others had suggested that it was impossible for 40 households to be surveyed in one day—but in fact the researchers were split into two teams and conducted 20 household interviews each, he said.

An 30 October 2006 BBC article reports this response from &quot;Lancet&quot; study author Les Roberts:

In Iraq in 2004, the surveys took about twice as long and it usually took a two-person team about three hours to interview a 30-house cluster. I remember one rural cluster that took about six hours and we got back after dark. Nonetheless, Dr. Hicks&#x27; concerns are not valid as many days one team interviewed two clusters in 2004.

=== Death certificates ===

Of the 1849 households that completed the survey there were reports of 629 deaths during the study period from 1 January 2002 through June 2006.

The &quot;Lancet&quot; study claims that, &quot;Survey teams asked for death certificates in 545 (87%) reported deaths and these were present in 501 cases. The pattern of deaths in households without death certificates was no different from those with certificates.&quot;

So, 92% of those asked for death certificates produced them.

In an interview in April 2007 &quot;Lancet&quot; study author Les Roberts reported that, &quot;90 percent of the people we interviewed had death certificates. We&#x27;re quite sure they didn&#x27;t make these deaths up.&quot;

The Iraq Body Count project questioned the &quot;Lancet&quot; study&#x27;s death certificate findings saying the &quot;Lancet&quot; study authors &quot;would imply that officials in Iraq have issued approximately 550,000 death certificates for violent deaths (92% of 601,000). Yet in June 2006, the total figure of post-war violent deaths known to the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH), combined with the Baghdad morgue, was approximately 50,000.&quot;

The August 2006 Basrah Governorate Assessment Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees described death certificate procedures of the Ministry of Health (MoH) as follows:

Death certificates, which are needed in order to obtain retirement benefits for a person&#x27;s surviving spouse or children, as well as for inheritance purposes, are issued by the MoH Births/Deaths Administrative Offices which are located in Public Hospitals. Death certificates are usually issued the same day. The following documents are required:

:*Medical report;
:*Civil ID card of the deceased person;
:*Food ration card of the deceased person.

:The issuance of death certificates is free.

In a 20 November 2006 &quot;Slate&quot; article, 2 of the &quot;Lancet&quot; study authors, Gilbert Burnham and Les Roberts, write:

In July [2006], for example, the Ministry of Health reported exactly zero violent deaths in Anbar Province, in spite of the contradictory evidence we saw on our televisions. Is that a surveillance network on which our understanding of what is going on in Iraq can depend?

In October 2006 Middle East Professor Juan Cole supported the &quot;Lancet&quot; findings, noting that Iraqis often bury their dead on the same day, and thus don&#x27;t require a death certificate, and also may not report it for fear of reprisals by militias:

Although there are benefits to registering with the government for a death certificate, there are also disadvantages. Many families who have had someone killed believe that the government or the Americans were involved, and will have wanted to avoid drawing further attention to themselves by filling out state forms and giving their address.

In a peer-reviewed paper on the Lancet survey, economist Michael Spagat examined the death certificate data. He noted that the very high reported rate of death certificates by the survey &quot;implies that the official death certificate system has issued, but failed to record the issuance of, about 500,000 death certificates&quot;, and notes that the rate of confirmations claimed by the second survey is substantially higher than the rate found in the first survey, despite covering a longer period, and calculates the odds against this to be very high. Spagat further notes several &quot;unlikely patterns in the confirmations of violent deaths through the viewing of death certificates and in the patterns of when death certificates were requested and when they were not requested.&quot; His analysis concludes that &quot;there is likely fabrication in the death-certificate data&quot; and that &quot;these data do not give reliable support to [the Lancet survey&#x27;s] very high estimated death rate.&quot;

=== Main street bias ===

The research team of Professors Neil Johnson, Sean Gourley and J.P. Onella of the physics department at Oxford University, Professor Michael Spagat of the economics department of Royal Holloway, University of London, and Professor Gesine Reinert of the statistics department at Oxford University, claimed the methodology of the study was fundamentally flawed by what they term &quot;main street bias&quot;. They claimed the sampling methods used &quot;will result in an over-estimation of the death toll in Iraq&quot; because &quot;by sampling only cross streets which are more accessible, you get an over-estimation of deaths.&quot;

These professors have published a detailed paper discussing this bias and the Lancet study called &quot;Conflict Mortality Surveys&quot;.

An 24 October 2006 &quot;The Guardian&quot; article reported this response from a &quot;Lancet&quot; study author:

But Prof Burnham said the researchers penetrated much further into residential areas than was clear from the &quot;Lancet&quot; paper. The notion &#x27;that we avoided back alleys was totally untrue&#x27;. He added that 28% of households were in rural areas—which matches the population spread.

An article in &quot;Science&quot; magazine by John Bohannon describes some of the criticisms, as well as some responses from the Lancet report&#x27;s lead author Gilbert Burnham. According to Bohannon and Johnson, the &quot;Lancet&quot; paper indicates that the survey team avoided small back alleys for safety reasons. But this could bias the data because deaths from car bombs, street-market explosions, and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets. Burnham counters that such streets were included and that the methods section of the published &quot;Lancet&quot; paper is oversimplified.

Bohannon also alleged that Burnham told &quot;Science&quot; that he does not know exactly how the Iraqi team conducted its survey; the details about neighbourhoods surveyed were destroyed &quot;in case they fell into the wrong hands and could increase the risks to residents.&quot; These explanations have infuriated the study&#x27;s critics. Michael Spagat, who specialises in civil conflicts, says the scientific community should call for an in-depth investigation into the researchers&#x27; procedures. &quot;It is almost a crime to let it go unchallenged,&quot; adds Johnson.

In a 24 November 2006 letter to &quot;Science&quot;, the authors of the &quot;Lancet&quot; report claimed that Bohannon misquoted Burnham, stating that &quot;in no place does our &quot;Lancet&quot; paper say that the survey team avoided small back alleys&quot;, and that &quot;The methods section of the paper was modified with the suggestions of peer reviewers and the editorial staff. At no time did Burnham describe it to Bohannon as &#x27;oversimplified&#x27;.&quot;

Bohannon defended his comments as accurate, citing Burnham saying, in response to questions about why details of selecting &quot;residential streets that did not cross the main avenues&quot;, that &quot;in trying to shorten the paper from its original very large size, this bit got chopped, unfortunately.&quot; In addition, the details which were destroyed refer to the &quot;scraps&quot; of paper on which streets and addresses were written to &quot;randomly&quot; choose households. The data set is now being selectively released.

The authors of the main street bias critique published a formal paper on this idea in the Journal of Peace Research. This paper subsequently won the journal&#x27;s 2008 Article of the Year award. The jury states that the article &quot;provides an important advance in the methodology for estimating the number of casualties in civil wars,&quot; and that, &quot;the authors show convincingly that previous studies which are based on a cross-street cluster-sampling algorithm (CSSA) have significantly overestimated the number of casualties in Iraq.&quot;

The authors have also published a follow-up paper in &quot;Europhysics Letters&quot; which provides a generic framework than can be used to assess sampling bias in certain social and biological systems. A special case of the framework can be used to derive the results presented in their Journal of Peace Research paper. The authors also investigate the sensitivity of their results to the underlying model parameter values. They reiterate their view that a more precise determination of the model parameters and, hence, the extent of sampling bias, is possible only if the actual micro-level data of the &quot;Lancet&quot; study are released.

=== Criticism of graph ===

Figure 4 from the October 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; survey of Iraq War mortality, showing a comparison of 3 mortality estimates. Two letters subsequently published in the Lancet journal challenged this graph.

The purpose of the graph in the &quot;Lancet&quot; article is in &quot;monitoring trends over time,&quot; which show increased deaths from 3 mortality different mortality estimates. Results from other studies track results from the Lancet surveys. The graph states, &quot;the similar patterns of mortality over time documented in our survey and by other sources corroborate our findings about the trends in mortality over time.&quot; The graph shows that the IBC and DoD data document the rise in cumulative deaths over time (plotted along the &quot;Deaths&quot; axis on the left). Rates for the Lancet are plotted independently using the &quot;Deaths per 1,000 per year&quot; axis on the right.

A letter by Debarati Guha-Sapir, Olivier Degomme and Jon Pedersen argues: &quot;Burnham and colleagues&#x27; figure 4, in which cumulated Iraq Body Count deaths parallel their study&#x27;s mortality rates, is misleading. Rates cannot be compared with numbers, much less with cumulative numbers.&quot; A second letter by Josh Dougherty argues that the DoD figure is misrepresented: &quot;Burnham and colleagues&#x27; assertion that the DoD &#x27;estimated the civilian casualty rate at 117 deaths per day&#x27; is mistaken, as is their figure 4, which repeats this error in graphic form. These data refer to Iraqi civilians and security-force personnel, not just to civilians, and to casualties (ie, deaths or injuries), not just deaths.&quot;

The &quot;Lancet&quot; authors replied, &quot;Josh Dougherty and Debarati Guha-Sapir and colleagues all point out that figure 4 of our report mixes rates and counts, creating a confusing image. We find this criticism valid and accept this as an error on our part. Moreover, Dougherty rightly points out that the data in the US Department of Defense source were casualties, not deaths alone... We wanted to show that the three sources all similarly pointed to an escalating conflict.&quot;

=== More responses to criticisms ===

In a &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; interview, study co-author Les Roberts defended the methodology by noting that the method is the standard used in poor countries. He also said that the same method was used by the US government following wars in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Roberts also said that the US government&#x27;s Smart Initiative program is spending millions of dollars per year teaching NGOs and UN workers how to use the same cluster method for estimating mortality rates.

The article&#x27;s authors defended their research, claiming that their work was the only active study of the death toll, and that this is more accurate than passively counting reported deaths. They cited a number of factors that could lead to smaller figures from other sources; for example, the Islamic requirement that bodies be buried within 24 hours of death. They claim that the sources of bias in their study push the figure down.

An 11 October 2006 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article reports:

:Ronald Waldman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for many years, called the survey method &quot;tried and true,&quot; and added that &quot;this is the best estimate of mortality we have.&quot;

In a letter to &quot;The Age&quot;, published on 21 October 2006, 27 epidemiologists and health professionals defended the methods of the study, writing that the study&#x27;s &quot;methodology is sound and its conclusions should be taken seriously.&quot;

A Reuters article reports on other researchers, epidemiologists, professors, and physicians who have defended the study. For example; this quote from the article;

&quot;Over the last 25 years, this sort of methodology has been used more and more often, especially by relief agencies in times of emergency,&quot; said Dr. David Rush, a professor and epidemiologist at Tufts University in Boston.

Sir Richard Peto, Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology in the University of Oxford, described the 2006 report as &quot;statistically valid&quot; in an interview on BBC television.

Dr. Ben Coghlan, an epidemiologist in Melbourne Australia, writes:

The US Congress should agree: in June this year [2006] they unanimously passed a bill outlining financial and political measures to promote relief, security and democracy in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The bill was based in part on the veracity of a survey conducted by the Burnet Institute (Melbourne) and the International Rescue Committee (New York) that found 3.9 million Congolese had perished because of the conflict. This survey used the same methodology as Burnham and his associates. It also passed the scrutiny of a UK parliamentary delegation and the European Union.

Burnham is one of the authors of both of the &quot;Lancet&quot; studies.

19 October 2006 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article reports:

A review of a variety of mortality estimates for Iraq was made by a group of scientists and published in 2008 in &quot;Conflict and Health&quot;, a peer-reviewed journal; their conclusion is that the Lancet &quot;studies provided the most rigorous methodology as their primary outcome was mortality. 

== UNDP ILCS study compared to &quot;Lancet&quot; studies ==

UNDP ILCS stands for the 2004 United Nations Development Programme Iraq Living Conditions Survey

The Iraq Body Count project (IBC) records civilian deaths reported by English-language media, including all civilian deaths due to coalition military action, the insurgency or increased criminal violence. The IBC site states: &quot;many deaths will likely go unreported or unrecorded by officials and media.&quot;

The IBC death count at the time of the October 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study was released was between 43,546 and 48,343, or roughly 7% of the estimate in the &quot;Lancet&quot; study. Besides the admitted IBC undercount due to its media reliance, some of the difference between the Lancet and IBC estimates is explained by the fact that the Lancet study was estimating all &quot;excess&quot; deaths from any and all violent and nonviolent causes, and includes combatants and civilians alike.

However, IBC believes some of it may also be explained by the &quot;Lancet&quot; having overestimated, citing the lower estimate from the UNDP&#x27;s 2004 Iraq Living Conditions Survey (ILCS).

IBC illustrated several of what it calls &quot;the main data that are relevant to a comparative assessment of&quot; the ILCS study and the 2004 &quot;Lancet&quot; study. It points to, for example, a much larger number of clusters (2,200 for ILCS vs. 33 for &quot;Lancet&quot;), and a more accurate sampling rate (1 in 200 for ILCS vs. 1 in 3,000 for Lancet). The 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study is somewhat larger than the first (it used 47 clusters instead of 33, and had a lower sampling rate). The 2004 Lancet study surveyed 988 households, and the 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study surveyed 1849 households. The ILCS study surveyed 22,000 households.

Lancet authors draw a different kind of comparison. From Appendix C of the 2006 Lancet study supplement there is this concerning the ILCS study:

Working for the U.N. Development Program [UNDP], the highly regarded Norwegian researcher Jon Pederson led a survey that recorded between 18,000 and 29,000 violent deaths during the first year of occupation. The survey was not focused on deaths, but asked about them over the course of lengthy interviews that focused on access to services. While this was more than twice the rate recorded by IBC [Iraq Body Count project] at the time, Pederson expressed concern for the completeness and quality of the data in a newspaper interview last year. The surveys reported in &quot;The Lancet&quot; were focused solely on recording deaths and count about two and a half times as many excess deaths from all causes over the same period.

In an 30 October 2006 BBC article &quot;Lancet&quot; study author Les Roberts compares the number of violent deaths found in the UNDP survey and in the 2 Lancet surveys through the first year after the invasion (by April 2004):

This UNDP survey covered about 13 months after the invasion. Our first survey recorded almost twice as many violent deaths from the 13th to the 18th months after the invasion as it did during the first 12. The second survey found an excess rate of 2.6/1000/year over the same period corresponding to approximately 70,000 deaths by April 2004. Thus, the rates of violent death recorded in the two survey groups are not so divergent.

The ILCS asked about deaths during the course of a lengthy interview on the household&#x27;s living conditions. In the 3 main ILCS documents (in pdf form) all the war-related deaths info is in 6 paragraphs on page 54 of the analytical report. It states:

The ILCS data has been derived from a question posed to households concerning missing and dead persons during the two years prior to the survey. Although the date was not asked for, it is reasonable to suppose that the vast majority of deaths due to warfare occurred after the beginning of 2003.

== Iraq Body Count project compared to &quot;Lancet&quot; studies ==

Besides the comparisons made in various publications, and in previous sections here, there are also more comparisons and criticisms of both studies in the relevant sections of the above-linked articles. In particular see the &quot;Undercounting&quot; section at Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 which lists many examples of how the media, hospitals, morgues, government, etc. miss some of the deaths caused by the war.

== ORB survey compared with &quot;Lancet&quot; studies ==

On 14 September 2007, ORB (Opinion Research Business), an independent UK based polling agency, published an estimate of the total casualties of the Iraq war. The figure suggested by ORB, which was based on survey responses from 1,499 adults, stands at 1,220,580 deaths, with a margin of error of 2.5%. This estimate, although conducted independently, and using a different polling methodology, is consistent with the Lancet findings if accounting for the additional 14 months covered by the ORB poll.

On 28 January 2008, ORB published an update based on additional work carried out in rural areas of Iraq. Some 600 additional interviews were undertaken and as a result of this the death estimate was revised to 1,033,000 with a given range of 946,000 to 1,120,000.

This ORB poll estimate came under criticism in a peer reviewed paper called &quot;Conflict Deaths in Iraq: A Methodological Critique of the ORB Survey Estimate&quot;, published in the journal Survey Research Methods. This paper &quot;finds fundamental flaws in the data underpinning ORB&#x27;s estimate&quot;, and concludes that the ORB data &quot;are not suitable for deriving any credible estimate but, given proper scrutiny, it is clear that ORB has overestimated by a wide margin.&quot;

== Iraq Family Health Survey compared with &quot;Lancet&quot; studies ==

The &quot;Iraq Family Health Survey&quot; published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; surveyed 9,345 households across Iraq and estimated 151,000 deaths due to violence (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) over the same period covered in the second &quot;Lancet&quot; survey by Burnham et al. The NEJM article stated that the second Lancet survey &quot;considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths&quot; and said the &quot;Lancet&quot; results were, &quot;highly improbable, given the internal and external consistency of the data and the much larger sample size and quality-control measures taken in the implementation of the IFHS.&quot;

Roberts says the discrepancy between the two studies arise with &quot;Lancet&quot; attributing most of the post-war excess deaths to violence, while only one-third of the excess deaths would be due to violence in the IFHS. See: Iraq Family Health Survey#400,000

The authors of the IFHS report have disputed this conclusion, saying, &quot;The excess deaths reported by Burnham &quot;et al.&quot; included only 8.2% of deaths from nonviolent causes, so inclusion of these deaths will not increase the agreement between the estimates from the IFHS and Burnham &quot;et al.&quot;&quot; They defended the results of their survey saying, &quot;It is unlikely that a small survey with only 47 clusters has provided a more accurate estimate of violence-related mortality than a much larger survey sampling of 971 clusters.&quot;

<doc id="1146172" wikidata="Q1148691" url="?curid=1146172" title="Dutch roll">
<text>Dutch roll is an aircraft motion consisting of an out-of-phase combination of &quot;tail-wagging&quot; (yaw) and rocking from side to side (roll). This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and spiral divergence). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, swept wings, and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers. A similar phenomenon can happen in a trailer pulled by a car.

==Stability==
In aircraft design, Dutch roll results from relatively weaker positive directional stability as opposed to positive lateral stability. When an aircraft rolls around the longitudinal axis, a sideslip is introduced into the relative wind in the direction of the rolling motion (due to the lateral component of lift when the wings are not level). Strong lateral stability (due to the more-direct airflow past the down wing, which has been pivoted forward by the slip) begins to restore the aircraft to level flight. At the same time, somewhat weaker directional stability (due both to greater drag from the wing which is now generating greater lift, and by aerodynamic force on the vertical fin due to the yaw) attempts to correct the sideslip by aligning the aircraft with the perceived relative wind. Since directional stability is weaker than lateral stability for the particular aircraft, the restoring yaw motion lags significantly behind the restoring roll motion. The aircraft passes through level flight as the yawing motion is continuing in the direction of the original roll. At that point, the sideslip is introduced in the opposite direction and the process is reversed.

There is a trade-off between directional and lateral stability. Greater lateral stability leads to greater spiral stability and lower oscillatory stability. Greater directional stability leads to spiral instability but greater oscillatory stability.

==Mechanism==
The most common mechanism of Dutch roll occurrence is a yawing motion which can be caused by a number of factors. As a swept-wing aircraft yaws (to the right, for instance), the left wing becomes less-swept than the right wing in reference to the relative wind. Because of this, the left wing develops more lift than the right wing causing the aircraft to roll to the right. This motion continues until the yaw angle of the aircraft reaches the point where the vertical stabilizer effectively becomes a wind vane and reverses the yawing motion. As the aircraft yaws back to the left, the right wing then becomes less swept than the left resulting in the right wing developing more lift than the left. The aircraft then rolls to the left as the yaw angle again reaches the point where the aircraft wind-vanes back the other direction and the whole process repeats itself. The average duration of a Dutch roll half-cycle is 2 to 3 seconds.

The Dutch roll mode can be excited by any use of aileron or rudder, but for flight test purposes it is usually excited with a rudder singlet (a short sharp motion of the rudder to a specified angle, and then back to the centered position) or doublet (a pair of such motions in opposite directions). Some larger aircraft are better excited with aileron inputs. Periods can range from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners.

Tex Johnston describes the Dutch roll as &quot;...an inherent characteristic of swept-wing aircraft. It starts with a yaw. In a 35-degree swept-wing airplane, a yaw is accompanied by a simultaneous roll in the direction of yaw. The roll is caused by changing lift factors as the airflow path over the wing changes. For example, in a left yaw the left wing slews toward the rear so that airflow is displaced spanwise from its normal front-to-rear path over the airfoil section. That reduces lift. Simultaneously, the advancing right wing gets more chordwise flow, and so its lift is increased. In combination the two conditions create a left roll. Similarly, a yaw to the right results in a roll to the right. An oscillation is set up.&quot;

==Rolling on a heading==
Dutch roll is also the name (considered by professionals to be a misnomer) given to a coordination maneuver generally taught to student pilots to improve their &quot;stick-and-rudder&quot; technique. The aircraft is alternately rolled as much as 60 degrees left and right while rudder is applied to keep the nose of the aircraft pointed at a fixed point. More correctly, this is a rudder coordination practice exercise, to teach a student pilot how to correct for the effect known as adverse aileron yaw during roll inputs.

This coordination technique is better referred to as &quot;rolling on a heading&quot;, wherein the aircraft is rolled in such a way as to maintain an accurate heading without the nose moving from side-to-side (or yawing). The yaw motion is induced through the use of ailerons alone due to aileron drag, wherein the lifting wing (aileron down) is doing more work than the descending wing (aileron up) and therefore creates more drag, forcing the lifting wing back, yawing the aircraft toward it. This yawing effect produced by rolling motion is known as adverse yaw. This has to be countered precisely by application of rudder &quot;in the same direction&quot; as the aileron control (left stick, left rudder – right stick, right rudder). This is known as synchronised controls when done properly, and is difficult to learn and apply well. The correct amount of rudder to apply with aileron is different for each aircraft.

==Name==
The origin of the name Dutch roll is uncertain. However, it is likely that this term, describing a lateral asymmetric motion of an airplane, was borrowed from a reference to similar-appearing motion in ice skating. In 1916, aeronautical engineer Jerome C. Hunsaker published: &quot;Dutch roll – the third element in the [lateral] motion [of an airplane] is a yawing to the right and left, combined with rolling. The motion is oscillatory of period for 7 to 12 seconds, which may or may not be damped. The analogy to &#x27;Dutch Roll&#x27; or &#x27;Outer Edge&#x27; in ice skating is obvious.&quot;
In 1916, Dutch Roll was the term used for skating repetitively to right and left (by analogy to the motion described for the aircraft) on the outer edge of one&#x27;s skates. By 1916, the term had been imported from skating to aeronautical engineering, perhaps by Hunsaker himself. 1916 was only five years after G. H. Bryan did the first mathematical analysis of lateral motion of aircraft in 1911.

==Notable incidents==
* On October 19, 1959, on a Boeing 707 on customer-acceptance flight, where the yaw damper was turned off to familiarize the new pilots with flying techniques, a trainee pilot&#x27;s actions violently exacerbated the Dutch roll motion and caused three of the aircraft’s four engines to be torn from its wings. The plane, a brand new 707-227, &quot;N7071&quot;, destined for Braniff, crash-landed on a river bed north of Seattle at Arlington, Washington, killing four of the eight occupants.
* On August 12, 1985, Japan Air Lines Flight 123, a Boeing 747SR, exhibited a Dutch roll in combination with phugoid cycles after losing all hydraulics following the loss of its vertical stabiliser due to an improperly-repaired rear pressure bulkhead rupturing from metal fatigue. It would ultimately crash in the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.
* On March 6, 2005, Air Transat Flight 961, an Airbus A310, was involved in a Dutch roll incident following structural failure of the rudder at cruising altitude after departure from Juan Gualberto Gomez Airport, Varadero, Cuba. The aircraft returned to the airport with serious structural damage and one flight attendant slightly injured.
* On May 3, 2013, a McConnell AFB, KS (USAF) KC-135R, &quot;63-8877&quot;, flown by a Fairchild AFB, Washington aircrew, broke up in flight about eleven minutes after taking off from Manas Air base in Kyrgyzstan, killing all three crew members. It was determined that a rudder power control unit malfunction led to a Dutch roll oscillatory instability. Not recognizing the Dutch roll, the crew used the rudder to stay on course, which exacerbated the instability, leading to an unrecoverable flight condition. The over-stressed tail section detached and the rest of the aircraft broke apart soon after. The aircraft was at cruise altitude about 200 km west of Bishkek before it crashed in a mountainous area near the village of Chorgolu, close to the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
* On October 30, 2015 a Leonardo-Finmeccanica-Helicopters Division (formerly AgustaWestland) AW609 prototype crashed in Italy killing its two pilots. The Italian ANSV established that Dutch roll during a high-speed test was the probable cause.
* On May 25, 2024, Southwest Flight 746, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, registration N8825Q, experienced a Dutch roll during a flight from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to Oakland International Airport. Post-flight inspection revealed damage to the standby power control unit (PCU). There were no injuries among the 175 passengers and six crew members.

<text>San Sosti (Calabrian: ; from ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Cosenza, in Calabria, southern Italy.

==History==

A highly decorated bronze axe-head was discovered near San Sosti in 1846. This votive offering was later bought by the collector and goldsmith Alessandro Castellani, from whom it was eventually acquired by the British Museum in 1884. On the axe is inscribed an important dedication in the Achaean dialect of Ancient Greek that can be dated to the sixth century BC.

In 1448, people from Albania migrated to San Sosti.
==Main sights==
*Sanctuary of Madonna del Pettoruto, founded in 1274 by the monks of the Abbey of Acquaformosa. It was rebuilt after the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes. It houses a 17th-century stone sculpture of a &quot;Madonna with Child&quot;

<doc id="1146186" wikidata="Q330125" url="?curid=1146186" title="Guyana national football team">
<text>The Guyana national football team, nicknamed the &quot;Golden Jaguars&quot;, represents Guyana in international football and is controlled by the Guyana Football Federation. It is one of three South American nations to be a member of the Caribbean Football Union of CONCACAF alongside Suriname and French Guiana. Until the independence of Guyana (1966), it competed as British Guiana. They qualified for the Caribbean Nations Cup in 1991, coming fourth, and in 2007. Guyana has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, but on 23 March 2019 they qualified for the first time for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==History==

===British Guiana (1905–59)===
Guyana (as British Guiana) played its first international football match on 21 July 1905, a 4–1 defeat against nearby and fellow British colony Trinidad and Tobago. Their next recorded game came almost 16 years later on 28 January 1921, an away 2–1 win against its neighbour Suriname. The two played again in Suriname on 27 August 1923, and on that occasion the hosts won 2–1. British Guiana did not play another match until 1937, when they lost two matches against Trinidad and Tobago in Suriname: 3–0 and 3–2. After seven years without a match, British Guiana entered a three-team tournament in Trinidad &amp; Tobago against its national side and Barbados. They won twice against Barbados (1–0 and 3–0) before drawing 1–1 and losing 3–0 to Trinidad and Tobago. In the final of this Trinagular tournament they again lost 3–0 to Trinidad and Tobago.

In November 1947 British Guiana played in a Standard Life tournament in Trinidad and Tobago. They beat the hosts 2–1 in their opening game on 5 November before beating Jamaica 2–0 the very next day. On 10 November they drew 0–0 with Jamaica before losing 2–0 to Trinidad and Tobago in the last game on 14 November.

British Guiana played its first home games in 1950 against Trinidad and Tobago: these were British Guiana&#x27;s first matches since the Standard Life tournament. British Guiana lost 1–0 and 4–1 before winning 1–0. The last match played under the name British Guiana was the next match on 2 March 1959 – a 2–2 draw against Trinidad and Tobago.

===Guyana===
After independence in 1966, Guyana did not play a match for five years. Their first fixtures under their new name were qualifiers for the 1971 CONCACAF Championship against Suriname. The first match, away, was lost 4–1 and the home match on 21 September 1971 was lost 3–2 as Suriname advanced 7–3 on aggregate. In 1976 Guyana entered its first ever World Cup qualification campaign with the aim of reaching the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. Guyana and Suriname were drawn in a two-legged preliminary in the Caribbean section of CONCACAF qualification and Guyana won the first leg 2–0 at home on 4 July 1976. The second leg in Paramaribo was lost 3–0 which allowed Suriname to advance.

===2006===
Guyana had a remarkable calendar year in 2006, with eleven successive wins, including five CONCACAF Gold Cup qualifiers These results boosted Guyana&#x27;s spot in the FIFA World Rankings by 87 spots in little over a year. As a consequence, the team rose to the top 12 in CONCACAF and were in the third rank of seeds in the World Cup qualifying draw.

===Caribbean Nations Cup 2007===
At the 2006–07 Caribbean Nations Cup, Guyana finished top of Group A in Stage One, then top of Group H in Stage Two (which they hosted), and finished 3rd in the Bobby Sookram Group, missing out on a semi-final berth on goal difference alone. Had Guyana reached the semi-finals, they would have qualified for the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

=== 2014 World Cup qualifying ===
With the return of international coach Jamaal Shabazz, Guyana finished top of a group containing Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Bermuda to reach the third round of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. They qualified with one game to go with a 2–1 home win against Trinidad and Tobago on 11 November 2011.

Guyana organised friendly matches against Colombia, Bolivia, Jamaica and Panama for the first team. In the third round group, they finished last, behind Mexico, Costa Rica and El Salvador, with one point from their six matches.

===Lack of football 2013/14===
From November 2012 to October 2014 Guyana did not play a single international fixture. This amongst other factors led to FIFA stepping in and removing the GFF executive at the end of 2014.

===2015 and 2016 return of the Golden Jaguars===
With FIFA stepping into Guyana once again, a FIFA Normalisation Committee was installed to regularise football in Guyana. With this came the search for a National Team Head Coach with Jamaal Shabazz reinstalled initially for one game versus Barbados in Jan 2015. As Guyana had lost many first team players to retirement since 2012, the squad was a new younger group with major gaps in the goalkeeper and defensive areas.

However a 2–2 draw with Barbados was enough for Shabazz and his staff, consisting of assistant coach Wayne Wiggy Dover, Operations Manager Mark Xavier, Team Manager Faizal Khan, Kit Man Trevor Burnett, GoalKeeper Coach Andrew Hazell, Physical Trainer Anson Ambrose, Medical Officer Denzil Hernandez.

<text>In coding theory, an erasure code is a forward error correction (FEC) code under the assumption of bit erasures (rather than bit errors), which transforms a message of &quot;k&quot; symbols into a longer message (code word) with &quot;n&quot; symbols such that the original message can be recovered from a subset of the &quot;n&quot; symbols. The fraction &quot;r&quot; = &quot;k&quot;/&quot;n&quot; is called the code rate. The fraction &quot;k’/k&quot;, where &quot;k’&quot; denotes the number of symbols required for recovery, is called reception efficiency. The recovery algorithm expects that it is known which of the &quot;n&quot; symbols are lost.

== History ==

Erasure coding was invented by Irving Reed and Gustave Solomon in 1960.

There are many different erasure coding schemes. The most popular erasure codes are 
Reed-Solomon coding,
Low-density parity-check code (LDPC codes), and
Turbo codes.

As of 2023, modern data storage systems can be designed to tolerate the complete failure of a few disks without data loss, using one of 3 approaches:
* Replication
* RAID
* Erasure Coding

While technically RAID can be seen as a kind of erasure code,
&quot;RAID&quot; is generally applied to an array attached to a single host computer (which is a single point of failure), while &quot;erasure coding&quot; generally implies multiple hosts,
sometimes called a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Servers (RAIS).
The erasure code allows operations to continue when any one of those hosts stops.

Compared to block-level RAID systems, object storage erasure coding has some significant differences that make it more resilient.

==Optimal erasure codes==

Optimal erasure codes have the property that any &quot;k&quot; out of the &quot;n&quot; code word symbols are sufficient to recover the original message (i.e., they have optimal reception efficiency). Optimal erasure codes are maximum distance separable codes (MDS codes).

===Parity check===

Parity check is the special case where &quot;n &quot;= &quot;k&quot; + 1. From a set of &quot;k&quot; values formula_1, a checksum is computed and appended to the &quot;k&quot; source values:
:formula_2
The set of &quot;k&quot; + 1 values formula_3 is now consistent with regard to the checksum.
If one of these values, formula_4, is erased, it can be easily recovered by summing the remaining variables:
:formula_5

RAID 5 is a widely-used application of the parity check erasure code.

===Polynomial oversampling===

==== Example: Err-mail (&quot;k&quot; = 2) ====
In the simple case where &quot;k&quot; = 2, redundancy symbols may be created by sampling different points along the line between the two original symbols. This is pictured with a simple example, called err-mail:

Alice wants to send her telephone number (555629) to Bob using err-mail. Err-mail works just like e-mail, except 
#About half of all the mail gets lost.
#Messages longer than 5 characters are illegal.
#It is very expensive (similar to air-mail).

Instead of asking Bob to acknowledge the messages she sends, Alice devises the following scheme.

#She breaks her telephone number up into two parts &quot;a&quot; = 555, &quot;b&quot; = 629, and sends 2 messages – &quot;A=555&quot; and &quot;B=629&quot; – to Bob.
#She constructs a linear function, formula_6, in this case formula_7, such that formula_8 and formula_9.

#She computes the values &quot;f&quot;(3), &quot;f&quot;(4), and &quot;f&quot;(5), and then transmits three redundant messages: &quot;C=703&quot;, &quot;D=777&quot; and &quot;E=851&quot;.

Bob knows that the form of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is formula_6, where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the two parts of the telephone number.
Now suppose Bob receives &quot;D=777&quot; and &quot;E=851&quot;.

Bob can reconstruct Alice&#x27;s phone number by computing the values of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; from the values (&quot;f&quot;(4) and &quot;f&quot;(5)) he has received. 
Bob can perform this procedure using any two err-mails, so the erasure code in this example has a rate of 40%.

Note that Alice cannot encode her telephone number in just one err-mail, because it contains six characters, and that the maximum length of one err-mail message is five characters. If she sent her phone number in pieces, asking Bob to acknowledge receipt of each piece, at least four messages would have to be sent anyway (two from Alice, and two acknowledgments from Bob). So the erasure code in this example, which requires five messages, is quite economical.

This example is a little bit contrived. For truly generic erasure codes that work over any data set, we would need something other than the &quot;f&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) given.

====General case====
The linear construction above can be generalized to polynomial interpolation. Additionally, points are now computed over a finite field.

First we choose a finite field &quot;F&quot; with order of at least &quot;n&quot;, but usually a power of 2. The sender numbers the data symbols from 0 to &quot;k&quot; − 1 and sends them. He then constructs a (Lagrange) polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of order &quot;k&quot; such that &quot;p&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) is equal to data symbol &quot;i&quot;. He then sends &quot;p&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), ..., &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1). The receiver can now also use polynomial interpolation to recover the lost packets, provided he receives &quot;k&quot; symbols successfully. If the order of &quot;F&quot; is less than 2&quot;b&quot;, where b is the number of bits in a symbol, then multiple polynomials can be used.

The sender can construct symbols &quot;k&quot; to &quot;n&quot; − 1 &#x27;on the fly&#x27;, i.e., distribute the workload evenly between transmission of the symbols. If the receiver wants to do his calculations &#x27;on the fly&#x27;, he can construct a new polynomial &quot;q&quot;, such that &quot;q&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) if symbol &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; was received successfully and &quot;q&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = 0 when symbol &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; was not received. Now let &quot;r&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) − &quot;q&quot;(&quot;i&quot;). Firstly we know that &quot;r&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = 0 if symbol &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; has been received successfully. Secondly, if symbol &quot;i&quot; ≥ &quot;k&quot; has been received successfully, then &quot;r&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) − &quot;q&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) can be calculated. So we have enough data points to construct &quot;r&quot; and evaluate it to find the lost packets. So both the sender and the receiver require &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;)) operations and only &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;) space for operating &#x27;on the fly&#x27;.

====Real world implementation====
This process is implemented by Reed–Solomon codes, with code words constructed over a finite field using a Vandermonde matrix.

Most practical erasure codes are systematic codes -- each one of the original &quot;k&quot; symbols can be found copied, unencoded, as one of the &quot;n&quot; message symbols.
(Erasure codes that support secret sharing never use a systematic code).

==Near-optimal erasure codes==
&quot;Near-optimal erasure codes&quot; require (1 + ε)&quot;k&quot; symbols to recover the message (where ε&gt;0). Reducing ε can be done at the cost of CPU time.
&quot;Near-optimal erasure codes&quot; trade correction capabilities for computational complexity: practical algorithms can encode and decode with linear time complexity.

Fountain codes (also known as &quot;rateless erasure codes&quot;) are notable examples of &quot;near-optimal erasure codes&quot;. They can transform a &quot;k&quot; symbol message into a practically infinite encoded form, i.e., they can generate an arbitrary amount of redundancy symbols that can all be used for error correction. Receivers can start decoding after they have received slightly more than &quot;k&quot; encoded symbols.

Regenerating codes address the issue of rebuilding (also called repairing) lost encoded fragments from existing encoded fragments. This issue occurs in distributed 
storage systems where communication to maintain encoded redundancy is a problem.

== Applications of erasure coding in storage systems ==

Erasure coding is now standard practice for reliable data storage.
In particular, various implementations of Reed-Solomon erasure coding are used by Apache Hadoop, the RAID-6 built into Linux, Microsoft Azure, Facebook cold storage, and Backblaze Vaults.

The classical way to recover from failures in storage systems was to use replication. However, replication incurs significant overhead in terms of wasted bytes. Therefore, increasingly large storage systems, such as those used in data centers use erasure-coded storage. The most common form of erasure coding used in storage systems is Reed-Solomon (RS) code, an advanced mathematics formula used to enable regeneration of missing data from pieces of known data, called parity blocks. In a (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) RS code, a given set of &quot;k&quot; data blocks, called &quot;chunks&quot;, are encoded into (&quot;k&quot; + &quot;m&quot;) chunks. The total set of chunks comprises a &quot;stripe&quot;. The coding is done such that as long as at least &quot;k&quot; out of (&quot;k&quot; + &quot;m&quot;) chunks are available, one can recover the entire data. This means a (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) RS-encoded storage can tolerate up to &quot;m&quot; failures. 

Example: In RS (10, 4) code, which is used in Facebook for their HDFS, 10 MB of user data is divided into ten 1MB blocks. Then, four additional 1 MB parity blocks are created to provide redundancy. This can tolerate up to 4 concurrent failures. The storage overhead here is 14/10 = 1.4X. 

In the case of a fully replicated system, the 10 MB of user data will have to be replicated 4 times to tolerate up to 4 concurrent failures. The storage overhead in that case will be 50/10 = 5 times. 

This gives an idea of the lower storage overhead of erasure-coded storage compared to full replication and thus the attraction in today&#x27;s storage systems.

Initially, erasure codes were used to reduce the cost of storing &quot;cold&quot; (rarely-accessed) data efficiently; but erasure codes can also be used to improve performance serving &quot;hot&quot; (more-frequently-accessed) data.

RAID N+M divides data blocks across N+M drives, and can recover all the data when any M drives fail.
In particular, RAID 7.3 refers to triple-parity RAID, and can recover all the data when any 3 drives fail.

==Examples==

<doc id="1146191" wikidata="Q810383" url="?curid=1146191" title="Basque mythology">
<text>The [[mythology]] of the ancient [[Basque people|Basques]] largely did not survive the arrival of Christianity in the Basque Country between the 4th and 12th century AD. Most of what is known about elements of this original belief system is based on the analysis of legends, the study of place names and scant historical references to pagan rituals practised by the Basques.

One main figure of this belief system was the female deity Mari. According to legends collected in the area of Ataun, the other main figure was her consort Sugaar. However, due to the scarcity of the material, it is difficult to say if this would have been the &quot;central pair&quot; of the Basque pantheon. Based on the attributes ascribed to these mythological creatures, this would be considered a chthonic religion as all its characters dwell on earth or below it, with the sky seen mostly as an empty corridor through which the divinities pass.

== Historical sources ==
The main sources for information about non-Christian Basque beliefs are:
* Strabo, who mentions the sacrifice of male goats and humans
* Arab writers from the time of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania (8th century)
* the 12th century diary of the pilgrim Aymeric Picaud
* various medieval sources making references to pagan rituals, including the records of the Inquisition
* 19th and 20th century collections of myths and folk-tales, such as those collected by José Miguel Barandiaran, which comprise by far the largest body of material relating to non-Christian beliefs and practices
* the modern study of place-names in the Basque Country

== Mythological creatures and characters ==

== The Urtzi controversy ==

Urtzi may have been a Basque mythological figure—a sky god—but may have been merely a word for the sky. There is evidence that can be read as either supporting or contradicting the existence of such a deity. To date, neither theory has been entirely accepted.

== Influence on Iberian pantheons ==
The Iberian Peninsula&#x27;s Indo-European speaking cultures like the Lusitanians and Celtiberians seem to display a significant Basque influence on their mythologies. This includes the concept of the Enchanted Mouras, which may be based on the Mairu, and the god Endovelicus, whose name may come from proto-Basque words.

== Myths of the historical period ==
After Christianization, the Basques kept producing and importing myths.
* Jaun Zuria is the mythical first Lord of Biscay, said to be born of a Scottish princess who had an encounter with the god Sugaar in the village of Mundaka.
* The battle of Roncesvalles was mythologized in the cycle of the Matter of France.
* In the Aralar Range, Saint Michael was said to appear to assist a local noble turned hermit.
* The coat of arms of Navarre was said to come from a feat in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa.
* The battle of Amaiur was the battle where Navarre lost its independence to the Crown of Castile.

<doc id="1146201" wikidata="Q348271" url="?curid=1146201" title="Joe Fagan">
<text>Joseph Francis Fagan (12 March 1921 – 30 June 2001) was an English footballer and manager. He was a coach and manager at Liverpool for twenty seven years under Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. As a manager he was the first English manager to win three major trophies in a single season and is one of only four English managers to win the European Cup. He played for Manchester City in the Football League First Division as a wing half. As his playing career came to an end, he decided to become a coach and worked at clubs in lower leagues before getting the chance to join Liverpool in 1958.

From December 1959, he worked with Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley and was highly successful in his coaching of the club&#x27;s reserve team, being mainly responsible for the development of future star players like Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith. After Shankly retired in 1974, Fagan became assistant manager to Paisley and finally manager himself when Paisley retired in 1983. In his first season, Fagan achieved an unprecedented &quot;treble&quot; as Liverpool won the European Cup, the League Championship and the League Cup. He had decided to retire at the end of his second season but his final match in charge was the 1985 European Cup Final which was the scene of the Heysel Stadium disaster, an event that caused him great distress.

Fagan was an uncomplicated man who believed in the simplicity of football, a devoted family man who preferred to just get on with his job and shun the limelight. He was one of the most respected figures in the game. He and his family lived in the same house not far from Anfield throughout his Liverpool career and afterwards. He died of cancer in 2001, aged eighty.

==Early life==
Joe Fagan was born in Walton Hospital in Walton, Liverpool, on 12 March 1921 and lived in the Litherland and Scotland Road areas of the city during his childhood and youth. His parents Patrick and Mary were of Irish descent. His father has been recorded as something of a dubious character who was often absent for long periods and Fagan owed a happy childhood to his mother. The close proximity of Anfield and Goodison Park meant that football was always a significant part of his life and he developed his ability as a boy. When he was fourteen, he captained his school, St Elizabeth Central, to the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; Trophy, a competition run by the Lancashire Schools Football Association.

After leaving school in 1937, Fagan signed for the St Helens-based Earlestown Bohemians club, known as the &quot;Bohs&quot;, who played in the Liverpool County Combination. This was a strong amateur league in which the &quot;A&quot; (third) teams of both Everton and Liverpool competed. Liverpool became interested and he was invited to Anfield for a trial. Manager George Kay offered him a contract but Fagan, then aged seventeen, declined as he thought his first team opportunities at Liverpool would be limited. On 8 October 1938, he signed for Manchester City. Throughout Fagan&#x27;s playing career, he was a right half, though he could also play at centre half. In the 1938–39 season, Fagan made good progress at City playing for the club&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; teams and then getting into the reserves. He was challenging for a first-team place when the Second World War began just as the 1939–40 season was getting under way and the Football League was suspended for the duration of the conflict.

==Second World War==
As Fagan, then aged eighteen, was not immediately eligible to join the armed forces, City gave him permission to play for Hyde United in the Cheshire County League which was not subject to the same wartime restrictions as the Football League, although it continued for only one season and was suspended in 1940. Fagan and his City teammate Billy Walsh made their debuts for Hyde on 13 October 1939, taking part in a 2–1 victory over Stalybridge Celtic. Fagan played a total of 26 games for Hyde and earned good reviews in the local press. Hyde had a successful season and won the Cheshire League&#x27;s East Section but lost the two-legged championship playoff against West Section winners Runcorn. Fagan returned to City for the 1940–41 season in which regionalised leagues were tentatively launched. He made his debut for City in the opening North Regional League match, which was a goalless draw at home to Everton and played five matches in all before he became due for military service.

He opted to volunteer rather than wait to be called up as this gave him a choice of services and so he was able to join the Royal Navy. He had never been to sea previously and immediately discovered that he was prone to seasickness. He was sent to Egypt where he worked as a telegraphist with a minesweeping flotilla and remained there until 1946. Many of the men he trained with were posted to the ill-fated and Fagan always counted himself lucky to have missed that posting. He was very interested in boxing and was a useful practitioner during his naval career until he had his nose broken. He played football for various service teams in Alexandria, one of his teams winning a competition called the Chrystall Cup in January 1946, only a few days before he returned to Britain to be demobilised. During periods of leave in England, Fagan had managed to represent City in six regional league matches, including a local derby against Manchester United; and he had also played for Portsmouth.

==Manchester City ==
When league football resumed after the war, Fagan hoped to establish himself as a regular member of the Manchester City side. The team were then in the Football League Second Division. Managed by Wilf Wild, City were promotion favourites, especially as they included notable pre-war players like captain Sam Barkas, goalkeeper Frank Swift and inside forward Alex Herd. They got off to a winning start but in November there was a change of manager and Sam Cowan, City&#x27;s pre-war captain, took over. Cowan was an innovator keen to make changes and one of these, on 1 January 1947 against Fulham at Maine Road, was to give Joe Fagan his official Manchester City debut more than eight years after he had joined the club. Fagan was then 25 and he played at right-half, making a creditable performance as City won 4–0. He played a key role in City&#x27;s 1946–47 Second Division Championship-winning team and went on to make 121 consecutive league appearances from debut until November 1949. Tony Matthews recorded views of Fagan&#x27;s &quot;solid worth&quot; to City in terms of his &quot;positional judgment, strong headwork (&quot;sic&quot;) and general reliability&quot;.

Fagan was, therefore, an established member of the first team when City returned to the First Division in 1947–48 and was an ever-present through that season and the next. He was a popular figure at Maine Road due to his strong team ethic, loyalty to the cause and an ever-ready smile, qualities that were to serve him well in his later coaching and management career. His friend Frank Swift gave him the nickname &quot;Patsy&quot;, a reference to the Irish folk song &quot;Hallo Patsy Fagan&quot;. In a match in November 1947, Fagan met his future colleague Bob Paisley for the first time when they played against each other in City&#x27;s 2–0 win over Liverpool at Maine Road. City finished tenth that season, one place above Liverpool. In 1948–49, under new manager Jock Thomson, City finished seventh.

In the 1948–49 season, Fagan was again an ever-present as City finished seventh under new manager Jock Thomson. The 1949–50 season was a poor one for City and, with two thirds of the matches played, City had won only five. Thomson was dismissed and, at the end of season, the club were relegated. In 1951, he sustained a broken leg and, aged 30, was forced to consider his future career options. He had played in 138 games for City and scored two goals. He decided to leave City and take up coaching.

Fagan began his coaching career at Nelson in the Lancashire Combination as player-manager, where he led the club to the 1951–52 championship in his first full season in charge. Simultaneously, he worked in a factory checking gas meters for leaks. Nelson applied for re-election to the Football League but were unsuccessful. Fagan moved on and made a brief return to the Football League as a player, making three appearances for Bradford Park Avenue in 1953 and then had a spell playing for Altrincham.

==Rochdale==
Fagan became assistant manager at Rochdale in 1954, serving under future Everton manager Harry Catterick until 1958. In addition to coaching, he took on numerous other duties at Spotland, such as doing the laundry and marking the pitches.

==Liverpool==
Following a recommendation by Catterick, Fagan was approached by Liverpool manager Phil Taylor about a coaching role and he accepted. The family moved into a house near Anfield where they remained for the rest of Fagan&#x27;s life.

===Reserve team coach (1958 to 1971)===
Bill Shankly joined Liverpool as manager in December 1959. Upon arriving at Anfield, Shankly was delighted to find Fagan on the coaching staff because, when manager of Grimsby Town in the early 1950s, he had tried to sign Fagan as a player. Shankly&#x27;s first words to Fagan at Anfield were: &quot;You must have been a good player, Joe, because I tried to sign you&quot;. On his first day in charge, Shankly held a meeting with the coaching staff which consisted of Bob Paisley, Reuben Bennett and Fagan to tell them that he was not bringing in his own coaches. He wanted to work with them and so guaranteed them their jobs – Fagan was confirmed as reserve team coach. Shankly pointed out that he would decide the training strategy and they must all work together with absolute loyalty to each other and to the club. Under Phil Taylor, training had been the traditional slog of physical exercise and road running. Shankly insisted on training which was &quot;based on speed and using the ball&quot; with everything done on grass. Five-a-side games were introduced as a key part of the strategy. Fagan had been keen on training with the ball at Nelson and was, like Paisley and Bennett, delighted to implement Shankly&#x27;s methods.

Training strategy was key to Liverpool&#x27;s success in the 1960s and afterwards. There was more to it than using the ball and playing five-a-side matches. Influenced by Paisley, Fagan and Bennett, Shankly cottoned on to the importance of allowing players to cool down after training before having a bath or shower. Paisley, as a trained physiotherapist, argued that a person needs to cool down for about 40 minutes after heavy exercise because, if they go into a bath while still sweating, their pores remain open and they are more susceptible to chills and strains. Fagan had advocated getting changed at Anfield before going via team bus to the club&#x27;s training complex at Melwood. They would return to bathe, change and eat. This routine satisfied the need for a cooling-down period and had the added advantages of encouraging team bonding during the two journeys and ensuring familiarity with Anfield, an important need for them as home team. Everton, by contrast, did everything at their Bellefield training complex and their players only went to Goodison Park for home matches every two weeks or so. Shankly claimed that the cooling-down period resulted in &quot;an astonishing lack of injuries over many seasons&quot;. For example, in 1965–66, when Liverpool won the league title and reached the European Cupwinners Cup final, they only used 14 players in the entire season.

As coach of Liverpool&#x27;s reserve team, Fagan helped nurture the talents of youngsters like Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith. During Shankly&#x27;s time as manager, the role of reserve team coach became one of the most critical jobs at Anfield as a key part of Shankly&#x27;s strategy was to transform the reserves into &quot;a kindergarten for future stars&quot;. Though using irony, Shankly emphasised this when he famously said that &quot;the city of Liverpool is blessed with not one, but two great football teams – Liverpool and Liverpool reserves&quot;.

===The &quot;Boot Room&quot;===
Fagan is credited with converting a storage area at Anfield into a &quot;common room&quot; for the coaches and it became the now-legendary Boot Room. Shankly held daily meetings in there with Fagan, Paisley and Bennett to discuss strategy, tactics, training and players.

===First team coach (1971 to 1979)===
In 1971, Fagan was promoted to work as a coach with the first team. Bill Shankly retired in the summer of 1974 and was succeeded by Bob Paisley. Fagan continued to work as first team coach.

===Assistant manager (1979 to 1983)===
In 1979, Fagan became Paisley&#x27;s assistant manager. Quiet and unassuming, he was renowned throughout football for his ability as a coach and Bobby Robson once rated him the best in the game, when interviewed during the early eighties.

===Appointment as Liverpool manager===
After Paisley retired, Fagan was appointed as manager on 1 July 1983, despite his initial reluctance to take on the role. Ian Rush confirmed Fagan&#x27;s reluctance but said the same had been true of Paisley on his appointment in 1974. Club policy was, as Rush put it, &quot;to appoint from within and ensure continuity, but only if the right man for the job was already on the staff&quot;. Paisley had told the board that Fagan was the right man because he knew the players and the game, though he admitted that Fagan had never shown any ambition to take on the role.

===1983–84 season===
In the 1983–84 season, Fagan&#x27;s first as Liverpool manager, the team won the European Cup, the League Championship and the League Cup and so Fagan was the first manager of an English club to win a treble, three major trophies in a single season. He had quickly expanded his squad with the signings of Michael Robinson and Gary Gillespie. His first game in charge ended in defeat, at the hands of Manchester United in the FA Charity Shield, but the first silverware was received following victory over Everton in the League Cup Final replay at Maine Road. The Championship was secured with a game to spare and then Liverpool won a penalty shoot-out against A.S. Roma in Rome to clinch the club&#x27;s fourth European Cup. Fagan won the Manager of the Year award.

===1984–85 season===
Soon afterwards, Liverpool&#x27;s captain Graeme Souness left the club for Sampdoria. Repeating the success of the 1983–84 season was always going to be difficult and Fagan signed Danish midfielder Jan Mølby, John Wark, Paul Walsh and Kevin MacDonald. Liverpool finished second behind Everton in the 1984–85 season but reached the European Cup final again. They were also beaten in an FA Cup semi-final replay by eventual winners Manchester United, meaning that they had been in contention for three major trophies that season, but ultimately would not win a major trophy; the first time in a decade that they had finished a season without silverware.

===Retirement announced===
On 29 May 1985, Fagan announced he would retire and was succeeded by Kenny Dalglish (who would continue as player-coach). In Dalglish&#x27;s autobiography, he claims that Fagan was left a haunted man for the rest of his life after witnessing the Heysel Stadium disaster. Never one to court the limelight, Fagan stepped back into anonymity following his retirement but continued to visit both Anfield and Melwood on a regular basis and was always on hand with words of advice for his successors.

==Personality ==
Stephen F. Kelly, in Shankly&#x27;s biography, describes Fagan as &quot;a rubber-faced character, as Liverpudlian as the Liver Bird... the psychologist, the genial scouser, full of Liverpool humour and always grinning&quot;. He praised Fagan&#x27;s man management as he &quot;knew when to kick backsides or when to put an arm around a player&quot;. Ronnie Moran remembered Fagan as &quot;what the bootroom was all about&quot; and he &quot;never met a nicer, more straightforward fellow&quot; because Fagan was &quot;never interested in the fancy side of football and never looked for the glamour or the glory&quot;.

Fagan was also a motorcar enthusiast.

==Personal life ==
Fagan met his future wife Lillian (Lil) Poke soon after he joined Manchester City in October 1938 and they were married two years later, during the war, before he joined the Navy. Their first child was born in June 1945 while he was stationed in Egypt and in all he and Lil raised six children together, five sons and a daughter. Throughout his time at Liverpool and until his death the family lived in the same modest house, 42 Lynholme Road, just a short walk away from Anfield stadium.

Fagan died of cancer on 30 June 2001, aged 80. He was buried at Anfield Cemetery, near Liverpool&#x27;s stadium. His wife Lil outlived Joe by nearly a decade, dying on 4 October 2010 at the age of 92 in a Lincolnshire nursing home.

<doc id="1146203" wikidata="Q7378048" url="?curid=1146203" title="R. Hollis Gause">
<text>Rufus Hollis Gause, Jr. (July 1, 1925 – September 6, 2015), known as R. Hollis Gause, was an American Pentecostal theologian and pastor. He was affiliated with the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee). Gause was the first dean of the Pentecostal Theological Seminary. 

== Early life and education ==

Gause was born July 1, 1925. His father was a Pentecostal Holiness Church minister and the family moved to the Church of God (Cleveland) when Gause was a teenager. Gause married Beulah Hunt in 1948 and they had a son, Valdane.

He graduated from high school in Clinton, South Carolina. He attended junior college at Emmanuel College in Georgia and finished his undergraduate studies at Presbyterian College back in Clinton. He then studied at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia and received a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1949 (which was upgraded to an M.Div. in 1971). He would eventually receive a Ph.D. in New Testament from Emory University in 1975 with a dissertation titled, &quot;The Lukan Transfiguration Account&quot; directed by William A. Beardslee.

==Career==

Gause began his teaching career in 1947 at Lee College in Cleveland, Tennessee. He taught there from 1947 to 1975 and 1982-1984.

Gause joined the lay ministry of the Church of God in 1943 and was promoted to the church&#x27;s ordained ministry in 1954.

Gause became the first dean and director of the Church of God Graduate School of Christian Ministries (now Pentecostal Theological Seminary) in 1975. Gause served as president of the Society for Pentecostal Studies from 1971 to 1972. He also pastored the Warren Church of God in Warren, Michigan (now known as the Maranatha Church of God) from 1982 to 1984.
Gause has been described by Chris E.W. Green as a mentoring figure to the members of the Cleveland School of Pentecostal scholars.

Gause has authored books of both a popular and scholarly nature. In 2006 he co-authored a book with Kimberly Ervin Alexander entitled &quot;Women in Leadership: A Pentecostal Perspective&quot; published by the Church of God Theological Seminary&#x27;s Center for Pentecostal Leadership and Care. 

A &quot;festschrift&quot; in honor of Gause titled &quot;Passover, Pentecost and Parousia&quot; and edited by Steven J. Land, Rickie D. Moore, and John Christopher Thomas was published in 2010.

Gause died in 2015 at the age of 90.

<doc id="1146204" wikidata="Q1199316" url="?curid=1146204" title="Linux on embedded systems">
<text>Computer operating systems based on the Linux kernel are used in embedded systems such as consumer electronics (eg. set-top boxes, smart TVs and personal video recorders (PVRs)), in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), networking equipment (such as routers, switches, wireless access points (WAPs) or wireless routers), machine control, industrial automation, navigation equipment, spacecraft flight software, and medical instruments in general.

Because of their versatility, operating systems based on the Linux kernel can be also found in mobile devices that are actually touchscreen-based embedded devices, such as smartphones and tablets, together with personal digital assistants (PDAs) and portable media players that also include a touchscreen. This is a challenge for most learners because their computer experience is mainly based on GUI (Graphical user interface) based interaction with the machine and high-level programming on the one hand and low-level programming of small microcontrollers (MCU) on the other hand while the concept of command line interfaces is widely unknown.

==History==
The Linux kernel has been ported to a variety of CPUs which are not only primarily used as the processor of a desktop or server computer, but also ARC, ARM, AVR32, ETRAX CRIS, FR-V, H8300, IP7000, m68k, MIPS, mn10300, PowerPC, SuperH, and Xtensa processors. Linux is also used as an alternative to using a proprietary operating system and its associated toolchain.

==Variants==
The Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset is a Linux distribution that fits on a floppy disk for outdated or low resource hardware.

==Devices coverage==
Due to its low cost (freely available source code) and ease of customization, Linux has been shipped in many consumer devices. Devices covering PDAs (like the Sharp Zaurus family), TomTom GPS navigation devices, residential gateways like the Linksys WRT54G series or smartphones such as the Motorola exz series, Openmoko handsets, devices running Sailfish OS developed by Jolla like Jolla C and Intex Aqua Fish and the Nokia N900 and Nokia N9.

Android, a Linux-kernel-based operating system acquired and extended by Google and introduced in 2008, has become a highly competitive platform for smartphones and tablets. In July 2012, Android&#x27;s smartphone market share in the United States was at 52%, reaching 82% worldwide in Q2 2015.

Starlink and SpaceX use embedded Linux on their constellations and rockets.

==Communities==
With the availability of consumer embedded devices, communities of users and developers were formed around these devices: replacement or enhancements of the Linux distribution shipped on the device has often been made possible thanks to availability of the source code and to the communities surrounding the devices. Due to the high number of devices, standardized build systems have appeared, including Yocto, OpenEmbedded, Buildroot, OpenWrt, and LTIB.

==Platform usage==
The advantages of embedded Linux over proprietary embedded operating systems include multiple suppliers for software, development and support; no royalties or licensing fees; a stable kernel; the ability to read, modify and redistribute the source code. The technical disadvantages include a comparatively large memory footprint (kernel and root filesystem); complexities of user mode and kernel mode memory access, and a complex device drivers framework.

==Limitations==
Not every embedded Linux distribution is required to or meets real-time requirements. This is particular relevant for safety critical applications and systems.

Projects to develop real-time and safety-critical support are Real-Time Linux (PREEMPT RT) and ELISA (under Linux Foundation). Real Time Linux project aims mainlining the PREEMPT_RT-version.

In order for the electronic system to run fully-fledged Linux OS and have multitasking it has to have enough operative memory (or replacing such) and memory management unit implementing virtual addressing to ensure compatibility with software running on Linux.

<text>Felipe Seade (1912 – 18 January 1969) was a painter and teacher of Lebanese descent who spent most of his life in Uruguay.

== Biography ==
Seade was born in Antofagasta, Chile, the elder son of a Lebanese immigrant family. Eleven years later his whole family moved to Montevideo, Uruguay. At the age of 12 Seade began working as an assistant to the Muralist Enrique Albertazzi and the painter Guillermo Rodríguez. Under Rodríguez&#x27; influence Seade took some painting courses at the Fine Arts Circle school. He had his first show in 1925. From 1931 well into the 1950s Seade presented work in many national and city halls.

In 1944, Seade began his parallel career as a teacher. He first work as teacher of drawing at the Liceo de Colonia, where he managed to paint the large mural, &quot;Alegoría al Trabajo&quot; (1936), and later as a professor of the Montevideo Fine Arts School, where he taught for 25 years.

It is impossible to understand Seade&#x27;s artistic life without a reference to his political life. He wanted to paint for &quot;the people, not for the walls of the bourgeoisie&quot;. He aspired to paint murals, the preferred way for his generation to reach the masses, but the only murals he managed to finish were the one in Colonia and the &quot;La marcha del Pueblo à la Piedra Alta&quot; (1939) at the Conference Hall of the Liceo de Florida. However, a significant part or Seade&#x27;s work is formed by his sketches of murals and preparity sketches for murals.

Thematically, Seade mostly sought to represent the characters of Uruguayan life – washing women, &quot;Gauchos&quot;, soccer fans, kids and women. Not from a tourist perspective, which he despised, but with the passion of a convinced social realist.

Seade was also an expert draughtsman. His most public work was a long series of illustrations for a key local magazine, &quot;Mundo Uruguayo&quot;. His more private drawings were mostly sketches for paintings.

Although Seade had an active participation in Salons and through his teaching was one of the more visible artists of Uruguay in his time, he disliked and avoided the world of galleries and art critics. This is probably one reason why after his death he has remained in relative obscurity. Important critics and historians such as Gabriel Peluffo Linari, Fernando García Esteban and Atahualpa del Cioppo have recognised Seade&#x27;s cultural importance.

<doc id="1146229" wikidata="Q234825" url="?curid=1146229" title="Pompeia (wife of Caesar)">
<text>Pompeia (&quot;fl.&quot; 1st century BC) was either the second or third wife of Julius Caesar. Pompeia&#x27;s parents were Quintus Pompeius Rufus, a son of a former consul, and Cornelia, the daughter of the Roman dictator Sulla. Caesar married Pompeia in 67 BC, after he had served as quaestor in Hispania, his first wife Cornelia having died in 69 BC.

In 63 BC, Caesar was elected to the position of the Pontifex Maximus, the chief priest of the Roman state religion, which came with an official residence on the &quot;Via Sacra&quot;. In 62 BC, Pompeia hosted there the festival of the Bona Dea (&quot;good goddess&quot;), which no man was permitted to attend. However, a young patrician named Publius Clodius Pulcher managed to gain admittance disguised as a woman, apparently for the purpose of seducing Pompeia. He was caught and prosecuted for sacrilege. Caesar gave no evidence against Clodius at his trial, and he was acquitted. Nevertheless, Caesar divorced Pompeia, saying that &quot;my wife ought not even to be under suspicion&quot;. This gave rise to a proverb, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s wife must be above suspicion&quot;, meaning that if one is romantically involved with a famous or prominent figure, one must avoid attracting negative attention or scrutiny.

Nothing specific is known about her life after the divorce, but it has been proposed that she may have married Publius Vatinius. Pompeia is depicted in various works of fiction including Robert Harris&#x27; &quot;Lustrum&quot; and Colleen McCullough&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series; in the &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; series, the theory that she remarried to Publius is depicted.

Mersin lies on the western side of Çukurova, a geographical, economic and cultural region of Turkey. It is an important hub for Turkey&#x27;s economy, with Turkey&#x27;s largest seaport located here. The city hosted the 2013 Mediterranean Games.

As urbanisation continues eastward, a larger metropolitan region combining Mersin with Tarsus and Adana (the Adana-Mersin Metropolitan Area) is in the making with more than 3.3 million inhabitants.

Çukurova International Airport (COV), 74 kilometres (46mi) from Mersin city center, is the nearest international airport. There are ferry services from Mersin to Famagusta (Mağusa) in Northern Cyprus. Mersin is linked to Adana via Tarsus by way of TCDD trains.

== Etymology ==
The city was named after the aromatic plant genus &quot;Myrsine&quot; (, ) in the family Primulaceae, a myrtle that grows in abundance in the area. The 17th-century Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi also recorded in his &quot;Seyahatnâme&quot; that there was a clan named the Mersinoğulları (Sons of Mersin) living in the area. In the 19th century Mersin was also referred to as Mersina.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
This coast has been inhabited since the 9th millennium BC. Excavations by John Garstang of the hill of Yumuktepe have revealed 23 levels of occupation, the earliest dating from ca. 6300 BC. Fortifications were put up around 4500 BC, but the site appears to have been abandoned between 350 BC and 300 BC.

=== Classical era ===

Over the centuries, the city was ruled by many states and civilisations including the Hittites, Assyrians, Urartians, Persians, Greeks, Armenians, Seleucids and Lagids. During the Ancient Greek period, the city bore the name Zephyrion (Greek: Ζεφύριον) and was mentioned by numerous ancient authors. Apart from its natural harbour and strategic position along the trade routes of southern Anatolia, the city profited from trade in molybdenum (white lead) from the neighbouring mines of Coreyra. Ancient sources attributed the best molybdenum to the city, which also minted its own coins.
The area later became a part of the Roman province of Cilicia, which had its capital at Tarsus, while nearby Mersin was the major port. The city, whose name was Latinised to Zephyrium, was renamed as Hadrianopolis in honour of the Roman emperor Hadrian. After the death of the emperor Theodosius I in 395 and the subsequent permanent division of the Roman Empire, Mersin fell into what became the Byzantine Empire.

The city was an episcopal see under the Patriarchate of Antioch. Le Quien names four bishops of Zephyrium: Aerius, present at the First Council of Constantinople in 381; Zenobius, a Nestorian, the writer of a letter protesting the removal of Bishop Meletius of Mopsuestia by Patriarch John of Antioch (429–441); Hypatius, present at the Council of Chalcedon in 451; and Peter, present at the Council in Trullo in 692. The bishopric is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees, but since the Second Vatican Council no new titular bishop of this Eastern see has been appointed.

=== Medieval period ===
Cilicia was conquered by the Arabs in the early 7th century, by which time it appears Mersin was a deserted site. The Arabs were followed by the Egyptian Tulunids, then by the Byzantines between 965 and c.1080 and then by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Under Armenian Cilicia, the region of Mersin served as the powerbase for the House of Lampron. From 1362 to 1513 the region was captured and governed by the Ramadanid Emirate, first as a protectorate of the Mamluk Sultanate, then as an independent state for roughly a century and then as a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire from 1513 until 1518 when it was annexed into the Ottoman Empire and turned into an imperial province.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
During the American Civil War, the region became a major supplier of cotton to make up for the high demand due to shortage. Railroads were extended to Mersin in 1866 from where cotton was exported by sea, and the city developed into a major trade centre. In 1909, Mersin&#x27;s port hosted 645 steamships and 797,433 tons of goods. Before World War I, Mersin exported mainly sesame seeds, cotton, cottonseed, cakes and cereals, and livestock. Cotton was exported to Europe, grain to Turkey and livestock to Egypt. Coal was the main import into Mersin at this time. Messageries Maritimes was the largest shipping line to use the port at Mersin.

In 1918, the Ottoman Empire collapsed and Mersin was occupied by French and British troops in accordance with the Treaty of Sèvres. It was recovered by the Turkish Army in 1921 at the end of the Franco-Turkish War. In 1924, Mersin was made a province, and in 1933 Mersin and İçel provinces were merged to form the (greater Mersin) İçel Province. The capital of the province was Mersin. In 2002 the name of the province was changed to Mersin Province.

As of 1920, Mersin had five piers at its port, with one privately owned by a railroad company serving Mersin, Tarsus, and Adana.

=== Modern Mersin ===

Today, Mersin is a large city spreading out along the coast. It has the longest seashore in Turkey as well as in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The Metropolitan Municipality has rescued long stretches of the seafront with walkways, parks and statues, and there are still palm trees on the roadsides.

Since the start of the Syrian War in 2011 Mersin has acquired a large population of Syrian refugees.

On 6 February 2023 Mersin was shaken by the twin Turkish-Syrian earthquakes. Citizens made homeless in cities further to the east also flocked to Mersin in search of shelter.

== Local Attractions ==
There are six museums within the Mersin urban area; Mersin Archaeological Museum, Mersin Atatürk Museum, Mersin Naval Museum, Mersin State Art and Sculpture Museum, Mersin Urban History Museum, Mersin Water Museum.

In the western suburb of Viranşehir (Ruined City) the remains of the ancient city of Soli/Pompeiiopolis stand close to the sea. Only two colonnades dating from the 2nd or 3rd century are obvious although the outline of the agora and of a mole from the harbour can just about be made out.

The Chasms of Heaven and Hell are located in the rural region of Silifke, a district in Mersin. The chasms are two sinkholes that were naturally formed from underground waters melting the layer of limestone above. The heaven sinkhole has a small monastery located in the corner of the entrance. The deepest point of the sinkhole is 135 meters deep. The hell sinkhole is 128 meters deep. In mythology, there is a story of Zeus temporarily trapping Typhon in the sinkhole.

The city has a total of three modern shopping malls, from which the Forum Mersin is the largest one. Mersin Marina can also be considered a shopping center with over 40 shops, apart from its main function as a marina. In the old city center you will find further shopping opportunities and bazaar-like shopping areas.

== Geography ==
Unlike the mountainous rugged terrain of the whole province Mersin is located at the western edge of the Çukurova plain. Earthquake risk of the city is relatively low especially compared to other regions of Turkey, but due to its closeness to several other fault lines in Anatolia, the city center, which was built on an alluvial deposit is considered to be a risk region.

=== Climate ===
Mersin has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Cs&quot;), a type of subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and mild, wet winters. Mersin has its highest rainfall in winter. The driest months are in summer with hardly any rainfall at all. The highest temperature of Mersin was recorded on 3 September 2020 at 41.5 °C (106.7 °F), and the lowest was recorded on 6 February 1950 at .
== Demographics ==
The population of the city was 1,040,507 according to 2022 estimates. This figure refers to the urban part of the four districts Akdeniz, Mezitli, Toroslar and Yenişehir, that had a total population of 1,077,054 at the end of 2022. As of a 2021 estimation, the population of the Adana-Mersin Metropolitan Area was 3,300,000 inhabitants, making it the 4th most populous area of Turkey.

== Economy and transportation ==
The Port of Mersin is the mainstay of city&#x27;s economy. It is an international hub for many vessels routing to European countries, with a capacity of 6,000 ships per year.

Next to the port is the Mersin Free Zone, established in 1986 as the first free zone in Turkey, the zone is a publicly owned centre for foreign investors, close to major markets in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, Russia and Central Asia. In 2002 the free zone&#x27;s trading volume was US$51.8 billion.

Historically, Mersin was a major producer of cottonseed oil. The area around Mersin is famous for citrus and cotton production. Bananas, olives and assorted other fruits are also produced.

Mersin has highway connections to the north, east and west. It is also connected to the southern railroad. Mersin railway station in the district of Akdeniz has been in use since 1886. Opened on 28 February 2015, Mersin Bus Terminus is the terminus for intercity bus services, replacing the bus station that had been in the city centre since 1986. A metro system with 11 stations and a length of is scheduled to open at the end of 2026.

<text>Fyfield is a village and civil parish in the English county of Wiltshire, in the Kennet Valley about west of Marlborough. The village is on the A4 road which was historically the main route from London to the west of England.

== History ==
Fyfield Down has extensive remains from successive phases of prehistoric to post-medieval activity. A 300-acre field system extending onto Overton Down has produced Iron Age and Romano-British finds.

The downland has many sarsen stones – pieces of dense, hard, sandy rock. In prehistoric times these were used for monuments, handaxes, quern-stones and other implements; medieval houses in Kennet Valley villages had walls made from sarsen blocks. Around 1850, Edward Free began a stone-cutting business at Fyfield which supplied much material for buildings, pavements and kerbs. The Free family moved to Marlborough in 1890; sarsen cutting declined after 1915 and ceased in 1939.

Prior to the mid 19th century, the village was centred south of the church, in the valley northeast of Lockeridge House (c. 1740). After a fire, this area was abandoned in favour of higher ground along the Bath Road; many of the new cottages were demolished during road improvements in the 1930s, leaving the village without a heart.

From c. 1880, about 560 acres on Fyfield Down and Overton Down, overlapping much of the present nature reserve and then owned by the Meux family, was managed as a rabbit warren for sport shooting. Most of the land was sold in 1906 by the widow of Sir Henry Bruce Meux to racehorse trainer Alec Taylor; in 1910 Taylor closed the warren and had some 14,000 rabbits killed, in order to use the area for exercising horses.

==Governance==
Fyfield elects a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of West Overton, named Kennet Valley Parish Council (the name Fyfield and West Overton was used until 2022). The parish falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for most local government functions.

Before the 19th century, Fyfield was a chapelry of Overton parish, alongside the tithings of East Overton, Lockeridge, Shaw, and West Overton. The tithings became a poor law parish called West Overton, while Fyfield relieved its own poor; this probably led the Census enumerators of 1841 to class Fyfield, with its medieval chapel, incorrectly as an ancient parish, which in turn led to its establishment as a civil parish.

Clatford Park and Overton Heath, to the south of the ancient Wansdyke and in the far south of the modern parish, were extra-parochial areas in the earlier 19th century. In 1896 they were merged into Fyfield parish.

==Landmarks==
North of the A4, the parish extends onto the Marlborough Downs. Here Fyfield Down is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, noted for its sarsen stones and prehistoric sites including The Devil&#x27;s Den, the remains of a neolithic burial chamber.

Parts of the south of the parish lie within the West Woods, which has been managed since 1931 by the Forestry Commission.

==Church==
The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas is Grade II* listed. The building has 13th-century origins and a 15th-century tower; it was restored in 1849. Today the church is part of the Upper Kennet benefice.

==Inns==
Fyfield&#x27;s earliest known inn was &quot;The Crown and Fighting Cocks&quot;. Mark Pope Snr was the innholder at the time of drafting his last will and testament in 1776. According to his will he left the inn to his wife, Anne Pope, for the term of her life or until the day she remarried. Mark died in June 1780 and his will was proved at Marlborough on 24 July 1780. In his will Mark referred to his &quot;ancient dwelling house or Inn known by the sign of The Crown and Fighting Cocks situated and being in Fyfield&quot;. This suggests the inn had been in business for an extended period.

Sometime during the 14 years Mark Pope&#x27;s widow, Anne, was innholder, the name changed to &quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot;. Anne died in 1794 and in her will she bequeathed &quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; inn to her son, Luke Pope. It is not known how long Luke operated the inn.

&quot;The Fighting Cocks’&quot; known innholders were:
* Mark Pope – from at least 1776 until 1780
* Anne Pope – from 1780 to 1794
* Luke Pope – from 1794 to ?
* Thomas Maslen – from at least 1849 to at least 1855
* Mrs Sarah Free – 1859
* Mr Free – reported in 1860 (start and finish date unknown)
* George Scott – 1875
* Thomas Smith – 1880
* An unnamed landlady – 1884 (start and finish date unknown)
* W.W.Jackman – 1889
* Thomas Maslen – 1894 (start and finish date unknown)
* Mr Caswell, blacksmith – 1906 (approx.) (start and finish date unknown)
* Mr E. Pile – 1936 (approx.) (start and finish date unknown)

&quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; was demolished in the 1930s to allow for road widening.

The company owns a substantial fleet of Industrial and depot shunting locomotives which are available for hire. The company is part of Ed Murray &amp; Sons Ltd.

==History==

=== The early years 1864–1901 ===

The company was founded in 1864 at Jack Lane in Hunslet by John Towlerton Leather, a civil engineering contractor, who appointed James Campbell (son of Alexander Campbell, a Leeds engineer) as his works manager.

The first engine was completed in 1865. It was &quot;Linden&quot;, a standard gauge delivered to Brassey and Ballard, a railway civil engineering contractor as were several of the firm&#x27;s early customers. Other customers included collieries. This basic standard gauge shunting and short haul &quot;industrial&quot; engine was to be the main-stay of Hunslet production for many years.

In 1871, James Campbell bought the company for £25,000 (payable in five instalments over two years) and the firm remained in the Campbell family ownership for many years. Between 1865 and 1870, the company had averaged fewer than ten locomotives a year but, in 1871, seventeen were built, rising over the next 30 years to a maximum of 34.
In 1870, Hunslet constructed its first narrow gauge engine &quot;Dinorwic&quot;, a diminutive gauge for the Dinorwic Slate Quarry at Llanberis. This engine, later renamed &quot;Charlie&quot;, was the first of 20 similar engines built for this quarry and did much to establish Hunslet as a major builder of quarry engines. The quarry was linked to Port Dinorwic by a gauge line for which Hunslet built three engines &quot;Dinorwic&quot;, &quot;Padarn&quot; and &quot;Velinheli&quot;. Much larger than the normal quarry type, gauge engines &quot;Charles&quot;, &quot;Blanche&quot; and &quot;Linda&quot; were built between 1882 and 1893 for use on the Penrhyn Quarry Railway &quot;main line&quot; between Bethesda and Port Penrhyn in North Wales.

Many short wheelbase locomotives were supplied to the Manchester Ship Canal Company in the 1880s.

The first Hunslet engine built for export was its No. 10, an shipped via Hull and Rotterdam to Java. By 1902, Hunslet had supplied engines to over thirty countries, often opening up new markets. In Ireland, Hunslet supplied engines to several of the newly opened narrow gauge lines and also in 1887 built the three unorthodox engines for the Lartigue Monorail system used by the Listowel Ballybunion Railway.

From 1873 onwards, many Hunslet locomotives were exported to Australia for use on both main line and lesser lines.

===1901–1939===
In 1901, James Campbell was still in charge as proprietor and his four sons were all working for the company, including the eldest son Alexander III who had taken over as works manager on the death of his Uncle George in 1890. In 1902, the company was reorganised as a private limited company with the name Hunslet Engine Company Ltd. but was still a family business. Following the death of James Campbell in 1905, the chairmanship passed to Alexander III and brother Robert became works manager, while brother Will retained the role of secretary and traveller with a seat on the board.

At about this time, Hunslet was building a series of s for the Sierra Leone Government Railway, design elements of which were included in the construction of the famous &quot;Russell&quot; a gauge engine built for the Portmadoc, Beddgelert &amp; South Snowdon Railway.

Following family disagreements, both Will and the youngest brother Gordon left the company and a serious injury left Robert disabled and unable to continue as works manager. The post of works manager was advertised and Edgar Alcock, then assistant works manager at the Gorton Foundry of Beyer-Peacock, was appointed in 1912. Alcock came to Hunslet at a time of change when the industry was being asked for far larger and more powerful locomotives than had ever been required in the past. This was true at Hunslet, which found its overseas customers asking for very large engines. One example was an order for two 86 ton s from the Antofagasta, Chile &amp; Bolivia Railway.

During the First World War, overseas orders dried up. The company, like many others, found itself employing women on the shop floor and engaged in the manufacture of munitions. It continued to produce limited numbers of locomotives, significant examples being lightweight narrow gauge designs for the War Department Light Railways.

After the First World War, Hunslet was once more able to attract overseas orders and it also received a series of repeat orders from the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway for 90 LMS Fowler Class 3F &quot;Jinty&quot; shunting engines. During the 1930s, Hunslet built its largest locomotives, two engines, built for a special train-ferry loading job in China – they were at that date the largest and most powerful tank engines ever built. A year or so later, the same design formed the basis for an 0-8-0 tender engine for India. Many other &quot;large-engine&quot; orders were received in these inter-war years.

Other independent British manufacturers failed to survive the depression of the 1920s and 30s and Hunslet acquired the patterns, rights and designs of other builders including Kerr, Stuart &amp; Company and the Avonside Engine Company.

===1930–2000===
John Alcock, who, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, became managing director of Hunslet in 1958, recalled his father telling him circa 1920, when he was still a schoolboy, that his main endeavour for the company would be in the application of the internal combustion engine to railway locomotion. Throughout the 1930s, Hunslet worked on the perfecting of the diesel locomotive.
During the Second World War, the company again served the country well in the manufacture of munitions, but it also built engines, both steam and diesel for the war effort. Noteworthy is its role in the production of the &quot;Austerity&quot; shunting locomotive. It was an austerity revision of the 50550 shunter design, itself a development of the Hunslet 48150 shunter design, of which 16 had been built pre-war. Hunslet produced 149 Austerities during the hostilities, and sub-contracted construction of almost 200 more. A total of 485 Austerities were built by Hunslet and other builders between 1943 and 1964, of which over 70 examples have been preserved.

Locomotive construction resumed after the war. Important in post-war production was the Hunslet flame-proof diesel engine for use in the coal mines, as well as further batches of Austerity shunters for the National Coal Board (NCB) and the British Army, and rebuilding some older Austerities, work which continued into the early 1960s. The last three Austerities were sold in 1970, one directly to preservation, one for scrap and one to the NCB.

The last industrial steam engine built in Britain was built at Hunslet in 1971 for export to Trangkil sugar mill in Central Java, Indonesia.

The &quot;Jack Lane, Hunslet, Leeds&quot; works was closed in 1995, the last order being a batch of narrow gauge diesel locomotives for tunnelling on the Jubilee Line Extension of the London Underground.

===2000–present===

In 2004, the Hunslet Engine Company was acquired by the LH Group. Production was moved to Barton-under-Needwood while other operations remained in Leeds.

In 2006, the company manufactured remote-controlled diesel electric shunters for John M. Henderson &amp; Co to be supplied to POSCO&#x27;s coking plant in South Korea. In the same year, several orders for underground and mining diesel locomotives were completed.

In 2007, Hunslet began developing a new family of locomotives ranging from shunters to vehicles weighing up to 100 tons. The first locomotive of the new class, the DH60C, a three-axle C diesel hydraulic shunting locomotive, was unveiled in July 2010.

The company also operated a locomotive hire business (including a British Rail Class 08 shunter acquired in 2006), mainly of industrial shunting locomotives.

In 2012, LH Group was sold to Wabtec for US$48 million. The company owns the rights to the names and designs of a number of former British locomotive manufacturers including Andrew Barclay, Avonside Engine Company, North British Locomotive Company, Greenwood &amp; Batley, Hudswell Clarke, John Fowler &amp; Co, Kerr, Stuart &amp; Company, Kitson &amp; Company and Manning Wardle. It also maintains and supplies spare parts for those brands. In 2021, the business was purchased by Ed Murray &amp; Sons.

====The Hunslet Steam Co.====
The Hunslet Steam Co. is part of the LH Group. The company is involved in new-build steam locomotives (including two Quarry Hunslet locomotives), boiler making and locomotive maintenance.

===Hunslet-Barclay Ltd===

The locomotive manufacturer Andrew Barclay was acquired by the Hunslet group in 1972, and renamed Hunslet-Barclay. It chiefly undertook maintenance and refurbishment of diesel multiple unit passenger trains at the Andrew Barclay Caledonia Works in Kilmarnock. In 2003, the LH Group acquired the locomotive interests of the company. In October 2007, Hunslet-Barclay went into receivership and in November was purchased by FKI (the owner of Brush Traction) and renamed Brush-Barclay. In 2011, Brush Traction and Brush-Barclay were purchased by Wabtec.

<doc id="1146252" wikidata="Q4856504" url="?curid=1146252" title="Banks dory">
<text>The Banks dory, or Grand Banks dory, is a type of dory. They were used as traditional fishing boats from the 1850s on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The Banks dory is a small, open, narrow, flat-bottomed and slab-sided boat with a particularly narrow transom. They were inexpensive to build and could be stacked or nested inside each other and stored on the decks of larger fishing vessels which functioned as mother ships.

Banks dories have long overhangs at the bow and stern which helps them lift over waves. There were one-man and two-man versions. Most could be fitted with sails. The dories became more stable when they were loaded with about half a ton of catch.

==Production==

The Banks dory type is very simple and efficient to produce, making them well suited to mass production. By 1880, Bank dories were being built in large numbers in the Massachusetts towns of Gloucester, Beverly, Essex, Newburyport, and Salisbury (Amesbury). Other major areas of production included Seabrook, New Hampshire; Lunenburg, Nova Scotia; Shelburne, Nova Scotia and both Portland and Bremen, Maine. Salisbury alone had 7 shops producing between 200 and 650 boats a year. The firm of Higgins and Giford of Gloucester advertised in 1886 that it had built over 3,000 dories in the preceding 13 years. Founded in 1793, Lowell&#x27;s Boat Shop of Amesbury Massachusetts is the oldest continuously operating boat shop in United States. It was the first to build these boats in large numbers and excelled at their mass production. In the year 1911 Lowell&#x27;s Boat Shop produced 2029 dories, averaging 7 dories a working day. A National Landmark and working museum, Lowell&#x27;s Boat Shop continues to build its dories and skiffs in the Lowell tradition to this day.
In Nova Scotia, the towns of Lunenburg and Shelburne maintained a rivalry in the mass production of dories. A distinction emerged in 1887 with the use in Shelburne of &quot;dory clips&quot;, metal braces used to join frames, versus the more expensive but stronger natural wood frames used in Lunenburg dories. The John Williams Dory Shop in Shelburne was one of several Shelburne factories mass-producing dories. It is now the Dory Shop Museum, operated by the Nova Scotia Museum and continues to produce dories.
==Mother ships==


Banks dories were carried aboard mother ships, usually fishing schooners, and used for handlining cod on the Grand Banks. Before Banks dories were introduced, fish were caught with handlines from the mother ship alone. Weather permitting, the dories were launched early each day with one or two crew and bait from previous catches. During the day they would return several times to the mother ship and unload their catches.

The barquentine, &quot;Gazela Primeiro&quot;, while not a schooner, was one of the last of the dory mother ships. She had a long association with dories and the Grand Banks cod industry and made her final voyage in 1969.

Banks dories have survived long voyages, some unintended, when the fishermen became separated from their mother ships. One of the more famous adventures was by Howard Blackburn who survived 5 days in the North Atlantic.

A Banks dory is seen in Winslow Homer&#x27;s painting &quot;The Fog Warning&quot;. The Boston Fine Art Museum gives this description:

The Fog Warning is a painting with a narrative, though its tale is disturbing rather than charming. As indicated by the halibut in his dory, the fisherman in this picture has been successful. But the hardest task of the day, the return to the main ship, is still ahead of him. He turns to look at the horizon, measuring the distance to the mother ship, and to safety. The seas are choppy and the dory rocks high on the waves, making it clear that the journey home will require considerable physical effort. But more threatening is the approaching fog bank, whose streamers echo, even mock, the fisherman&#x27;s profile.

==Other uses==

The rugged construction, affordability and ease of stowage made banks dories popular for work boats on large sailing vessels as well as steamships and motor vessels. These same virtues made them popular for inshore fishermen in some locales. They were also used in later years as lifeboats and tenders on commercial motor fishing boats such as Cape Islander fishing boats. In recent times, the history and iconic look of banks dories have made them popular for amateur boat builders and some recreational boaters.

<text>Cerro Negro is an active volcano in the Cordillera de los Maribios mountain range in Nicaragua, about from the village of Malpaisillo. It is a very new volcano, the youngest in Central America, having first appeared in April 1850. It consists of a gravelly basaltic cinder cone, which contrasts greatly with the surrounding verdant hillsides, and gives rise to its name, which means Black Hill. 
Cerro Negro has erupted frequently since its first eruption. One unusual aspect of several eruptions has been the emission of ash from the top of the cone, while lava erupts from fractures at the base.

Cerro Negro is a polygenetic cinder cone that is part of the Central America Volcanic Arc, which formed as a result of the Cocos Plate subducting under the Caribbean Plate, at a rate of per year. It is the largest and southernmost of four cinder cones that have formed along a NW-SE trend line in the Cordillera de los Maribios mountain range. Despite its youth, Cerro Negro has been one of the most active volcanoes in Nicaragua, with its latest eruption occurring in 1999. Since its birth in 1850, it has erupted approximately 23 times.

==Eruptive history==
The first recorded eruption of Cerro Negro occurred on April 13, 1850 and volcanic activity lasted until May 27. Central vent and explosive eruptions transpired, with lava flow and damage to land and property. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) was recorded at 2 out of 8, classifying the eruption as Strombolian/Vulcanian. Finally, the lava volume was recorded to be 5.4 x 10 and the tephra volume was 6.5 x 105 m3.

Cerro Negro&#x27;s second eruption took place on November 14, 1867 and volcanic activity lasted until November 30. Radial fissure and explosive eruptions occurred, with some lava flows, along the NE-SW trend line fissure. The VEI was also recorded at 2 (Strombolian/Vulcanian), and the tephra volume was 8.6 x 106 m3.

The third eruption of Cerro Negro occurred 32 years later and lasted from November 22 to November 29, 1899. Explosive eruptions resulted in damaged land, and the VEI was also recorded as a 2. Finally, the tephra volume was documented at 1.7 x 106 m3. 
From October 28 to November 3, 1914, the volcano erupted explosively at the central vent. Mudslides also resulted in increased damage to the land, but there were no fatalities because they did not flow over any villages or towns. Although the VEI was yet again 2, the tephra volume was a recorded 2.8 x 106 m3.

Five years later, Cerro Negro erupted again from June 20–30, 1919, with explosive eruptions resulting in a VEI of 2. No tephra or lava volumes were recorded at this time. 
Just four years after that, from October 23 until December 11, 1923, Cerro Negro erupted along the summit and upper north flank. Central vent and radial fissure explosions erupted during this time, and lava flows were recorded in this VEI 3 sub-plinian eruption. It was the largest eruption in the history of the volcano, with the lava volume being 1.0 x 107 m3 and the tephra volume being 3.6 x 107 m3.

Cerro Negro erupted next on February 10, 1929, and volcanic activity lasted until March. Flank (excentric) vent and radial fissures also explosively erupted, resulting in excessive lava flows. The volume of lava erupted was recorded at only 1.0 x 105 m3 in the VEI 2 eruption.

===Eruptions of 1947, 1948 and 1950===
Another 18 years passed before Cerro Negro erupted again, but on July 9, 1947 the volcano had its largest eruption to date. The VEI was recorded at 3 along the summit and NE flank, with the eruptive characteristics including central vent eruption, flank venting, and lava flows. Evacuations were called for the Malpaisillo village, and major land and property damage resulted from the volcano&#x27;s explosive eruptions. The recorded lava volume was 3.8 x 106 m3 and the recorded tephra volume was 3.1 x 107 m3.
Less than one year later, on March 31, 1948, Cerro Negro recorded another Strombolian eruption (VEI 2) from its central vent. No lava or tephra volumes were recorded, however. A similar eruption occurred in June 1949, with the VEI 2 eruption exploding from the central vent.

Another sub-plinian VEI 3 explosive vulcanian eruption occurred from Cerro Negro&#x27;s central vent from November 21 to December 17, 1950. Lava flows resulted, but evacuation was unnecessary. The lava volume was 1.0 x 105 m3 and the tephra volume was 3.8 x 107 m3 for this particular eruption.

===1954 eruption===
In February 1954 another VEI 2 Strombolian eruption exploded out of Cerro Negro&#x27;s central vent, but lava and tephra volumes were not recorded. Three years later from September 4–24, 1957, a VEI of 2 was recorded via the summit and east flank of Cerro Negro. Lava flows damaged the land from the explosive eruption, with the lava volume reaching 4.5 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume reaching 2.8 x 106 m3.
The summit and south flank exploded next on September 28, 1960, and volcanic activity continued until December 26. This particular VEI was determined to be level 3 after radial fissure and central vent eruptions occurred. Land damage was caused to the surrounding land via lava flows, with the volume of the lava recorded at 5.2 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume recorded at 3.4 x 107 m3.

Cerro Negro&#x27;s NE-flank fissure erupted next on October 25, 1961. Although radial fissure eruption and lava flow was characteristic of this particular eruption, the VEI was only recorded as a 1, and no lava or tephra volumes were recorded. It was the smallest Cerro Negro eruption to date.

Another eruption from the central vent occurred on March 21, 1962 and lasted until early April. The VEI was recorded as 2, and lava flows were observed, although no land damage was witnessed. Exactly one year later, a VEI 1 eruption occurred from the central vent of Cerro Negro on March 21, 1963.

===1968 eruption===

The volcanic activity from October 23 until December 10, 1968 marked the formation of the Cristo Rey crater, when the summit and south flank of Cerro Negro erupted with a sub-plinian VEI of 3. The new vent formed a lava flow 750m long and 600m wide and a thickness of 3m. Thirteen villages located near the erupting volcano were evacuated on the 27th because of the excessive ash falls. Additional larger-scale evacuations Nicaragua&#x27;s 2nd largest city, León, recorded ash falls of over 1 cm thick. Lava flows advanced at a rate of 23 m/day, and it caused additional land damage as the lava poured from three of Cerro Negro&#x27;s craters, fountaining to heights of 30m into the air. The eruptive ash columns reached heights of 2.3 to 4.8 km. In addition, incandescent gases from the vents raised to heights of 120 meters, and these could be seen over 50 km away from the volcano. When the volcanic activity ceased, the lava volume totaled 6.9 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume totaled 2.7 x107 m3.

===1969 eruption===
Another small-scale VEI 1 eruption took place after the central vent exploded from December 19–29, 1969. But two years later from February 3–14, 1971, the towns surrounding Cerro Negro were again evacuated due to the sudden sub-plinian VEI 3 eruption of the summit and the formation and eruption of a new eastern flank. Volcanic bombs were shot approximately 600m into the air, and incandescent gases were released during the time in between eruptions. Ash columns were approximately 10 km high, and a tephra volume of 5.8 x107 m3 (over 300 square kilometers) caused major damage to the local crops and buildings. The city of León alone had recorded 18 cm of ash, which resulted in large-scale building collapse.

===1992 eruption===
Over 20 years passed, and the Cerro Negro volcano was at peace until one of the volcano&#x27;s largest eruptions occurred on April 9, 1992. Volcanic activity lasted for a total of five days, with the main sub-plinian eruption (VEI 3) occurring over a two-day time period, producing an ash column that was roughly seven kilometers high. Over 20,000 people were immediately evacuated, mostly due to failed water systems until eruptions ceased on the 14th of April. This eruption caused several fatalities, and widespread damage to land and property after the tephra volume measured 2.6 x 107 m3. This large tephra volume produced approximately four centimeters of ash across most of León, resulting in many collapsed roofs and additional injuries and fatalities.

===1995 eruption===
Three years later, volcanic activity started on May 29, 1995, which marked the beginning of the first phase of this eruption. Small, phreatic eruptions occurred frequently during this phase, averaging 100-160 explosions per day. These Strombolian eruptions generated convective ash columns that reached heights of 200–1000 meters, and these explosions lasted for a period of 79 days. A low-energy pyroclastic flow was observed on the northwestern flank on June 2. After June 6, the number of eruptions decreased gradually at a rate of 30-40 eruptions per day. By July 19, all volcanic activity ceased for a period of 95 days. By mid-November, the hiatus ended and the second phase commenced. Eruptions continued for a period of thirteen days and lasted until December 3, 1995. During this time, the eruptions were larger, and volcanic bombs and blocks up to two meters in diameter were ejected from Cerro Negro. Ash columns achieve heights of 2 to 2.5 meters While the VEI was only measured as a 2, central vent explosions, pyroclastic flows, phreatic explosions, and lava dome extrusion were all characteristic of this eruption period. New lava filled about 2/3 of the 1992 crater, and additional lava flows caused damage to land, extending 1.5 km north of the north base cone. Ash falls caused damage to property and farmland, with an average deposit of two millimeters per day in León (~20 km from volcano), but there were no fatalities during the safe evacuation of 6000 people in the surrounding villages. Overall, the lava flow volume reached 8.0 x 106 m3 and the tephra volume peaked at 5.8 x 106 m3 during this eruption period, resulting in the addition of about 50 meters of height to the cinder cone.

===1999 eruption===
The last volcanic activity at Cerro Negro occurred on August 5, 1999 and lasted for a total of two days. Three earthquakes ( 5.2) occurred in three hours, which triggered a small-scale eruption of the volcano. It was the first time in the history of Cerro Negro that large-magnitude earthquakes preceded the eruption. The VEI was only recorded as a 1, as the south flank (near the Cristo Rey crater) experienced radial fissure eruption, along with explosive and phreatic eruptions, in the formation of three new vents. Small-scale evacuations of surrounding villages were carried out, but the low-volatile, highly crystalline basaltic magma only had a lava volume of 6 x 105 m3. Additionally, the tephra volume was only in the 106m3 range. It was concluded that the volcanic activity of Cerro Negro in 1999 was tectonically-induced, and had three earthquakes not occurred, the eruption would have also not occurred.

The most recent eruptions at Cerro Negro occurred in August 1999, although strong seismic activity was registered in early 2004. In 1998, an eruption was thought to have occurred shortly after the passage of Hurricane Mitch, but it later transpired that the copious amounts of steam seen rising from the volcano were caused by rainwater percolating through to hot lava from the 1995 eruption.

Following the 1999 eruption, the summit crater and fissures created from this eruption are currently the main source of volcanic gas flux today. It is estimated that the total CO2 output of Cerro Negro is conservatively estimated to be 2,800 t d-1.
Although the Cerro Negro volcano has only been around for a period of 159 years, it has erupted at least 23 times, which is highly active compared to most volcanoes. This historical growth of the volcano has allowed for documentation of the growth of this volcano over time. It was discovered that the timing of future eruptions is correlated with the volume of the previous significant eruption. Since there have been steady-state eruptions since 1900, a Cerro Negro Time-Volume Prediction Model was made.

Although a small-scale eruption did occur in 1999, another larger-scale eruption is expected to occur in the immediate future. Cerro Negro does not differ from most volcanoes, in that numerous hazards are associated with volcanic activity. These hazards include lava flows, mudslides, pyroclastic flows, and earthquakes, but the biggest hazard of Cerro Negro is the effects of the ash and tephra fallouts.

Currently, Cerro Negro is being monitored by the Nicaraguan Seismic Network, which is affiliated with INETER (Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales). These programs have a total of 36 stations throughout Nicaragua, and they each have a monitoring station on Cerro Negro. Seismic activity, gas concentrations, surface deformation, and temperature fluctuations are all carefully watched in order to mitigate the effects of a possible eruption.

As Cerro Negro lies in a less-populated area of Nicaragua, there is less volcanic risk to human life compared to many of the other volcanoes in the world. Mudslides and pyroclastic flows that come from Cerro Negro are not in the direct path of major cities or towns. Nevertheless, the eruptions of Cerro Negro have been known to cause catastrophic damage to buildings and farmland, due to the widespread ash falls and tephra fallouts.

<doc id="1146256" wikidata="Q5014246" url="?curid=1146256" title="CSR Limited">
<text>CSR Limited is a major Australian industrial company, producing building products and having a 25% share in the Tomago aluminium smelter located near Newcastle, New South Wales. It is publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. In 2021, it had over 3,000 employees and reported an after-tax profit of $146 million. The company has a diversified shareholding, with predominantly Australian fund managers and retail owners. The group&#x27;s corporate headquarters is in North Ryde, Sydney.

Founded in Sydney in 1855 as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company at the Old Sugarmill, the company expanded into milling cane in Queensland and Fiji from the 1870s. It quickly became the most important miller and refiner in Australasia, with a virtual monopoly on Queensland and Fiji sugar production up to, respectively, 1989 and 1972. It also sold by-products of the sugar industry, from molasses to ethanol. In 2010, CSR sold its sugar and ethanol business, which had been given the name Sucrogen in 2009, to the Singaporean company Wilmar. As of 2015, the business is known as Wilmar Sugar.

The company began to diversify into building products as early as 1942, with the construction of a plaster mill in Sydney, and in 1947 the company began manufacturing plasterboard. It acquired Bradford Insulation in 1959, which produced heat insulation materials for buildings, and currently has a substantial share of the insulation market in Australia and Asia. The company also produces fibre cement sheeting, aerated concrete products, bricks, permanent formwork for walls and systems to support plasterboard construction through Rondo, a joint venture with Boral. It spun off its interests in heavy building products to a separate listed company, Rinker Group, in 2003. In 2007, CSR established the Viridian glass company which it sold in 2019.

French multinational Saint-Gobain acquired CSR for billion (billion) in 2024.

== Sugar ==
===Early sugar refining operations===
Founded in Sydney by Edward Knox in 1855 as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the company first began refining imported raw sugar at its refineries in Canterbury then Chippendale. CSR expanded into the Melbourne market in 1857 with the purchase of a refinery at Sandridge through its associate company, the Victoria Sugar Company. These operations were later moved to refineries at Pyrmont and Yarraville.

===Expansion into central milling===
By the late 1860s, relying on imported raw sugar was no longer financially viable for the company and Knox decided to establish his own supplies by establishing centralised mills to crush sugarcane grown by farmers in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales. Raw sugar produced from the Southgate, Chatsworth, Darkwater and Harwood mills on the Macleay, Clarence and Richmond Rivers was transported by ship to the company&#x27;s refineries in Sydney and Melbourne. This proved very profitable and CSR was able to retain a near monopoly of sugar refining in the Australian colonies. In 1880-81, CSR further consolidated their milling operations by the construction of the high-output Condong and Broadwater mills also located in northern New South Wales.

===Queensland and Fiji plantations===
In 1880, Knox handed over the management of CSR to his second son Edward William Knox who immediately began a rapid expansion of the company&#x27;s operations into Queensland and Fiji. E.W. Knox oversaw the transition of the company into owning and running large sugar plantations in these regions which were serviced on-site by high capacity mills also owned by CSR.

====Queensland==== 
The Queensland Government passed an Act in 1881 allowing CSR to acquire large amounts of land in the north of the colony and to invest £500,000 in establishing sugar plantations in these areas. The two major CSR plantations created at this time were the Victoria Plantation and the Homebush Plantation. Blackbirded South Sea Islander labour was utilised by CSR to deforest the land, plant and cut the sugarcane, and build the mills. Knox and the company&#x27;s Queensland director E.B. Forrest chartered blackbirding vessels to bring Islanders to the plantations. The 1884 recruiting voyage of &quot;Hopeful&quot; blackbirding labour vessel which kidnapped and murdered many Islanders was under contract to deliver labourers to Ebenezer Cowley, manager of the Victoria Plantation. An 1886 inquiry into this type of labour found that up to 60% of the Islanders transported to the Homebush Plantation had died within four years. The kidnapping and deaths of these workers resulted in 111 Islanders being removed from the CSR plantations by the Queensland government and returned to their homelands in 1885. CSR was compensated £4,424 by the government for the loss of these labourers. CSR also experimented with cheap Chinese, Javanese, Singhalese and Japanese coolie labour on their plantations.

By the 1890s, Knox decided to abandon the plantation system in Queensland and return to the central mill method used in its New South Wales operations. CSR subdivided the Victoria and Homebush estates into small farms which it sold or leased to white farmers who would sell their cane to CSR to be processed at its nearby mills.

====Fiji====
In 1880, E.W. Knox expanded the company&#x27;s sugar plantation and milling systems to Fiji with a large estate and mill being established at Nausori. Another estate and mill was constructed at Rarawai in 1886. Cheap Fijian and South Sea Islander labourers were utilised with high mortality rates being recorded. At Nausori, the Agent-General for Immigration in Fiji, described the deaths of the Islander labourers at the CSR plantation as appalling and tantamount to manslaughter. Local laws made it harder to use blackbirded Melanesian labour and CSR soon turned to Indian coolie labour imported from Calcutta. By 1885, most of CSR&#x27;s Fijian plantation workforce were coolies on 5 year contracts.

===Later sugar operations===
CSR constructed further large refineries and mills in Australasia including the Chelsea Sugar Refinery built near Auckland in 1884, a large refining complex at Glanville, Adelaide in 1891 to process sugar from Mauritius, and the massive sugar mill at Lautoka in 1903. In 1923, the Queensland state government signed an agreement with CSR to refine all of that state&#x27;s sugar production, a monopoly that was to continue until 1989, 16 years after CSR had left Fiji. At that time, about 80% of production was exported.

CSR separated its sugar and energy businesses from its building products business in 2009, which resulted in the creation of Sucrogen as CSR&#x27;s sugar and energy business. It then operated seven sugar mills in Queensland: Victoria Mill and Macknade Mill in the Herbert River region, centred around the town of Ingham; Invicta Mill, Inkerman Mill, Kalamia Mill and Pioneer Mill in the Burdekin Region; and Plane Creek Mill at Sarina, south of Mackay. CSR also owned a 75% share in the Sugar Australia refineries in Melbourne and Mackay (the other 25% being Mackay Sugar Co-Operative&#x27;s) and in the Chelsea Sugar Refinery in Auckland. Using the molasses by-product from the sugar mills, the company also distilled ethanol for use in fuel ethanol manufacture, and varying grades of domestic industrial ethanols for food production and other chemical processes. The CSR brand was used on most of the retail sugar products produced. The production made up around 60% of the sugar on the Australian domestic market, and 80% of that in New Zealand.

Sucrogen was sold to Singapore company Wilmar International in 2010.

==Construction and mining==
In February 1980, CSR acquired construction and mining contractor Thiess in a hostile takeover. In April 1981, the construction division was sold to a consortium of Hochtief, Westfield Group and Leslie Thiess.

Between 1948 and 1966, CSR operated mines at Wittenoom, Western Australia that produced 161,000 tons of crocidolite fibre. During this time, thousands of workers and their families, visitors, tourists, consultants and government officials were exposed to potentially lethal levels of blue asbestos almost a thousand times higher than occupationally regulated at the time. Many of them would develop fatal diseases due to this, such as pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer.

Despite warnings from the Western Australia Health Department and other health authorities in the early 1960s, CSR continued to operate the mine until 1966. The first court victory for the Wittenoom victims was in 1988, when Klaus Rabenault won his case against Midalco, a subsidiary of CSR that ran the mines. The judge ruled that CSR acted with &#x27;continuing, conscious and contumelious&#x27; disregard for its workers&#x27; safety and that Rabenault should be awarded $426,000 by way of compensation and $250,000 in punitive damages.

It is predicted that by 2020, almost a third of the people who passed through Wittenoom during the mines&#x27; operating years would be diagnosed with a fatal disease caused by their dangerous exposures to blue asbestos. This would be an estimated 2,000 cases totalling costs of A$500 million in damages from CSR.

In the 1980s CSR was pursued by victims of asbestosis caused by the operation of its Midalco subsidiary in Western Australia. By 1988, 258 damage-related suits had been taken against CSR, though only a handful of cases had been heard in the courts. In May that year a Victorian court made an award of A$680,000 against Midalco to a former worker, after he contracted the fatal lung cancer, mesothelioma; and in August, lesser amounts were awarded to other workers, against CSR itself (22). Finally in 1989 and the following year, a settlement was made.

Meanwhile, CSR and the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia were engaged in a dispute as to which of them was responsible for payment of the damages to the workforce and their dependents, with CSR arguing that it was not responsible for liabilities sustained by its Midalco subsidiary. The two bodies finally reached agreement in early 1989 to share the costs of compensation (23). Fifteen million dollars would be paid out by each of them to cover damages for the seven-year period of operation of the Wittenoom mine, with an additional total of A$20 million payable to claimants who worked there before 1959 (23). By the end of that year, researchers at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, and the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, in Perth had estimated that a further 692 workers would fall victim to mesothelioma with another 183 cases of lung cancer to be expected. They predicted another 432 successful claims would be made, in addition to the 356 already accepted (24).

At the beginning of 1990, 322 workers had been compensated (25). A few months later CSR made a partial re-entry into mining, when it bought up 48 quarries from the US ARC subsidiary of the British Hanson corporation. It also pulled out of a plasterboard joint venture with Redland Plasterboard (established in 1987) while retaining its Australian and New Zealand interests, through Monier PGH—a company with around half of the Australian roofing tile market (26).

The mining and milling of blue asbestos at Wittenoom is the greatest single industrial disaster in Australia&#x27;s history.

<doc id="1146259" wikidata="Q1452648" url="?curid=1146259" title="Freddy Fender">
<text>Freddy Fender (born Baldemar Garza Huerta; June 4, 1937 – October 14, 2006) was an American Tejano singer, known for his work as a solo artist and in the groups Los Super Seven and the Texas Tornados. His signature sound fused country, rock, swamp pop and Tex-Mex styles.

Active since the 1950s, when he got his start playing Spanish-language rock and roll for Tejano audiences, Fender&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough came in 1975 with the crossover hit &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls,&quot; which topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop and country charts. He recorded further country hits such as &quot;Wasted Days and Wasted Nights,&quot; &quot;Secret Love,&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll Lose a Good Thing,&quot; &quot;Living It Down,&quot; and &quot;The Rains Came.&quot;

==Early years==
Fender was born in San Benito, Texas, United States, to Margarita Garza and her Mexican husband, Serapio Huerta. He made his debut radio performance at age 10 on Harlingen, Texas, radio station KGBT, singing a then-hit &quot;Paloma Querida.&quot;

Fender dropped out of high school at age 16 in 1953, and, when he turned 17, he enlisted for three years in the U.S. Marine Corps. He served time in the brig on several occasions because of his drinking, and he was court-martialed in August 1956 and discharged with the rank of private (E-1). According to Fender, he later received a letter from the Department of the Navy stating that he wrongfully received a dishonorable discharge because of alcoholism, and he was given a general discharge. He returned to Texas and played nightclubs, bars, and honky-tonks throughout the south, mostly to Latino audiences. In 1957, then known as El Bebop Kid, he released two songs to moderate success in Mexico and South America: Spanish-language versions of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot; (as &quot;No Seas Cruel&quot;) and Harry Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Farewell.&quot; He also recorded his own Spanish version of Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; under the title &quot;Tu Frío Corazón&quot; (&quot;Your Cold Heart&quot;).

He became known for his rockabilly music and Eddie con los Shades persona. In 1958, he legally changed his name from Baldemar Huerta to Freddy Fender. He took the name Fender from the guitar and amplifier, and Freddy because the alliteration sounded good and would &quot;sell better with gringos!&quot; He then relocated to California.

==Initial success==
In 1959, Fender recorded the blues ballad &quot;Wasted Days and Wasted Nights.&quot; His self-penned song was a hit, but he was beset by legal troubles in May 1960 after he and a band member were arrested for possession of marijuana in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After serving nearly three years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, he was released through the intervention of then-governor Jimmie Davis, also a songwriter and musician. Davis requested that Fender stay away from music while on probation as a condition of his release. However, in a 1990 NPR interview on &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot; (rebroadcast October 17, 2006), Fender said that the condition for parole was to stay away from places that served alcohol.

By the end of the 1960s, Fender was back in Corpus Christi, Texas, working as a mechanic and attending local institution, Del Mar College, while playing music only on the weekends.

==Number one on pop and country charts==

In 1974 Fender recorded &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls.&quot; The single was selected for national distribution and became a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country and Pop charts. It sold over a million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in May 1975. His next three singles, &quot;Secret Love,&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll Lose a Good Thing,&quot; and a remake of &quot;Wasted Days and Wasted Nights,&quot; all reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country chart. Between 1975 and 1983, Fender charted 21 country hits, including &quot;Since I Met You Baby,&quot; &quot;Vaya con Dios,&quot; &quot;Livin&#x27; It Down,&quot; and &quot;The Rains Came.&quot; &quot;Wasted Days and Wasted Nights&quot; became Fender&#x27;s second million-selling single, with the gold disc presentation taking place in September 1975.

Fender was also successful on the pop charts. Besides &quot;Before the Next Teardrop Falls&quot; reaching number one on the pop chart in May 1975, &quot;Wasted Days And Wasted Nights&quot; went into the pop top 10 and &quot;Secret Love&quot; into the top 20. &quot;Since I Met You Baby,&quot; &quot;You&#x27;ll Lose A Good Thing,&quot; (his last pop top 40) &quot;Vaya con Dios,&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; It Down&quot; (his last to reach the pop top 100) all did well on the pop chart.[&quot;&quot;] 

At the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) Jukebox Awards in 1975, Fender was awarded &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Record of the Year&quot; for having the highest-earning songs played on jukebox machines in the United States.

===Swamp pop influences===
Fender was heavily influenced by the swamp pop sound from southern Louisiana and southeast Texas as is shown by his recording swamp pop standards on his 1978 album &quot;Swamp Gold&quot;. One of his major hits, &quot;Wasted Days and Wasted Nights,&quot; has a typical swamp pop ballad arrangement. Fender associated with swamp pop musicians such as Joe Barry and Rod Bernard and issued many recordings on labels owned by Huey P. Meaux, a Cajun who specialized in swamp pop. As music writer John Broven observed, &quot;Although Freddy was a Chicano from Texas marketed as a country artist, much of his formative career was spent in South Louisiana; spiritually, Fender&#x27;s music was from the Louisiana swamps.&quot;

==Later years==
===Texas Tornados===
In 1989, Fender teamed up with fellow Tex–Mex musicians Doug Sahm, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers to form the Texas Tornados, whose work meshed conjunto, Tejano, R&amp;B, country, and blues to wide acclaim. When the Texas Tornados went to audition for Warner Bros. Records, Fender did not think that the group was strong enough, so he brought his own band. The audition was nearly a bust, because he played country music and that was not what the executives were looking for. Fender was persuaded to play some vintage rock and blues numbers, which was what the executives were looking for, and was subsequently given a record contract. After being a solo act, Fender was not sure if signing with a group was a good thing, but according to Fender, he &quot;just wanted to record for a major label.&quot; 

The group released four albums and won a Grammy Award in 1990 for Best Mexican American Performance for the track &quot;Soy de San Luis&quot;. Fender described the group in this way: &quot;You&#x27;ve heard of New Kids on the Block? Well, we&#x27;re the Old Guys in the Street.&quot; Following the death of Sahm, the Tornados&#x27; production slowed. A live 1990 appearance on TV&#x27;s &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, one of three the group made, was released in 2005 as part of the &quot;Live From Austin, Texas&quot;, series.

===Los Super 7===
In the late 1990s, Fender joined another supergroup, Los Super Seven, with Los Lobos&#x27; David Hidalgo and César Rosas, Flaco Jiménez, Ruben Ramos, Joe Ely, and country singer Rick Trevino. The group won a 1998 Grammy in the Mexican American Performance category for their self-titled disc.

===Later work===
In 2001, Fender made his final studio recording, a collection of classic Mexican boleros titled &quot;La Música de Baldemar Huerta&quot; that brought him a third Grammy award, this time in the category of Latin Pop Album. Joe Reyes, who worked with Fender in 2004 for a Texas Folklife and Austin tribute titled &quot;Fifty Years of Freddy Fender,&quot; said of the album: &quot;When he did Mexican standards at that point in his career, I expected it to be good because he&#x27;s a perfectionist. But that record is so beautifully recorded; his voice is perfection. I was so proud it was coming back to his roots.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
On March 13, 2001, Fender was erroneously reported to be dead by &quot;Billboard&quot;. He laughed off the magazine&#x27;s error. He underwent a kidney transplant in 2002 with a kidney donated by his daughter and underwent a liver transplant in 2004. Nonetheless, his condition continued to worsen. He was suffering from an &quot;incurable cancer&quot; in which he had tumors on his lungs.[&quot;&quot;] 

On June 5, 2005, Fender was present for the dedication of a $1.4 million water tower in San Benito. The tower bears an image of Fender along with the words &quot;San Benito Hometown of Freddy Fender,&quot; and is visible when driving east on U.S. Route 83 through San Benito. On December 31, 2005, Fender performed his last concert and resumed chemotherapy.

He died on October 14, 2006, at the age of 69 of lung cancer at his home in Corpus Christi, Texas, with his family at his bedside. He was buried in his hometown of San Benito.

He said in a 2004 interview with the Associated Press that he wished to become the first Mexican American inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

A Freddy Fender Museum and The Conjunto Music Museum opened November 17, 2007, in San Benito. They share a building with the San Benito Historical Museum. His family maintains the Freddy Fender Scholarship Fund and donates to philanthropic causes that Fender supported.

==Film credits==
In 1988, Fender played the mayor of a small town in the Robert Redford–directed film, &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot;. He appeared as Tony in the prison movie, &quot;Short Eyes&quot;, a 1977 film adaptation, directed by Robert M. Young, of the Miguel Pinero play. Fender also played the role of Pancho Villa in 1979&#x27;s &quot;She Came to the Valley&quot; (later released as &quot;Texas in Flames&quot;). The movie was directed by Albert Band and based on the book by Cleo Dawson. Fender appeared as himself in an episode of the television series, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.[&quot;&quot;]

<doc id="1146264" wikidata="Q2094553" url="?curid=1146264" title="West Overton">
<text>West Overton is a village and civil parish in the English county of Wiltshire, about west of Marlborough. The river Kennet runs immediately north of the village, separating it from the A4 road. The parish includes the village of Lockeridge, also near the river, further east (downstream).

== History ==
The area has many prehistoric sites, and the Avebury section of the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage site extends into the northwest of the parish. Within that area, on the southern slopes of Overton Down, are seven Bronze Age round barrows, forming a cemetery which extends south onto Overton Hill, overlooking the river. In modern archaeology, this it the type site for the Overton Period of 2000–1650 BC.

Also on Overton Hill, just over the parish boundary, is The Sanctuary, the site of a Neolithic monument which had two concentric circles of stones and four concentric circles of timber posts, and was linked to the stone circles at Avebury, 2.5km to the northwest, by two lines of stones known as West Kennet Avenue.

North of the village, on the slopes of Overton Down, are an oval Iron Age enclosure and three Roman burial mounds, a short length of Roman road and an Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemetery. In the far north of the parish are further Bronze Age, Roman and later settlements. In the south, within West Woods, is a Neolithic long barrow.

A manor is named as &quot;Uferan Tune&quot; in a charter dated 939. In 1086, the Domesday survey recorded 13 households at (West) &quot;Ovretone&quot;, and land held by Wilton Abbey. Another 13 were at Fyfield and two at East Overton, both on land held by St. Swithun&#x27;s Priory, Winchester; there were smaller settlements at &quot;Locherige&quot; (Lockeridge) and at Shaw. It is likely that in the 12th and 13th centuries the entire parish lay within Savernake forest.

The earlier manors were reflected in the later composition of Overton parish, which had tithings of East Overton, West Overton, Lockeridge and Shaw, together with the chapelry of Fyfield. The western boundary of the parish was defined by an ancient trackway on the summits of the Marlborough Downs. The parish had a detached part to the southwest, namely the chapelry of Alton Priors (its name deriving from ownership by St Swithun&#x27;s Priory). The settlements at East and West Overton were adjacent, and since the later 18th century the merged village has been called West Overton.

The village of Shaw, southwest of West Overton and straddling the Wansdyke earthwork, was apparently deserted in the 15th century. Alton Priors and Fyfield became separate civil parishes in the 19th century.

The Wiltshire Victoria County History has an account of the many owners of the manors of Overton, Lockeridge and Shaw. By 1870, when the Overton estate was sold to the trustees of London brewery owner Sir Henry Meux, it encompassed land at Fyfield, Lockeridge and Clatford, and the woodland at West Woods. After the death of his son in 1900, the estate was owned for a short time by Alec Taylor of Manton House. The Forestry Commission bought West Woods in 1931.

The London to Bath road was turnpiked in 1743. In the 1970s, the opening of the M4 motorway, about to the north, reduced the amount of traffic on what was by then the A4.

==Local government==
West Overton parish elects a joint parish council with the adjacent parish of Fyfield, named Kennet Valley Parish Council (the name Fyfield and West Overton was used until 2022). The parish falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

== Religious sites==
===Parish church===

There was a church at Overton in the 12th century, and by the next century the churches at Fyfield and Alton Priors were dependent on it. St. Swithun&#x27;s Priory, Winchester, appropriated Overton church and its chapels in 1291.

The parish church of St Michael and All Angels was built in 1877–8, in flint with squared sarsen banding, by C.E. Ponting, architect to the Meux estate. The tower – described by Pevsner as &quot;just a little too thin to be genuine&quot; was not completed until 1883. It replaced an earlier church which had become dilapidated, and the nave was built on the same foundations.

Construction was financed by Sir Henry Meux, and reused the chancel arch and three nave windows; oak beams from the nave roof were made into internal doors, a lectern and panels of the pulpit. A fragment of a Norman church survives: the head of a small 12th-century window was reset into a wall of the porch.

The church had three bells in 1553, one of which is still present. Another dates from 1606; in 1883 one old bell was recast and three made, bringing the peal to six. Ponting also designed the parish war memorial, a tall stone cross dedicated in 1921, which stands opposite the churchyard. The church was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1958.

Alton Priors was anciently a chapelry of Overton, its church being some five miles south of Overton church by road. In 1913, Alton Priors was detached from Overton vicarage and attached to the adjacent rectory of Alton Barnes.

The benefice was united with those of Fyfield and East Kennett in 1929. Today the parish is part of the Upper Kennet Benefice, created in 1978, which covers eight churches in the area.

===Methodists===
From 1901 to 1966 there was a Methodist chapel at West Overton.

==Amenities==
A National School was built at Lockeridge in 1875 to serve the parishes of West Overton and Fyfield. The building (and extensions) continues in use as Kennet Valley C of E Voluntary Aided Primary School.

The parish has a village hall, Kennet Valley Village Hall, near Lockeridge.

==Landmarks==

Overton manor house, close to the church, is from the 16th and 17th centuries with later improvements; the main wing has a tile-hung upper floor under a thatched roof, and at right angles a former barn is in red brick. West Overton House, in the northeast of the village, is a former rectory of the late 18th century with later extensions.

Shaw House, which replaced an earlier manor house 400m to the east, was built in brick in the early 19th century. Lockeridge House, standing on the other side of the river from Lockeridge village, was built in red brick around 1740 and is Grade II* listed.

North of the A4, the parish extends onto the Marlborough Downs. On Overton Down is an earthwork built in 1960 as a long-term archaeology experiment. The Piggledene valley, with its sarsen stones, is a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest managed by the National Trust.

Overton Hill, with prehistoric features including The Sanctuary, is to the west of the village and partly in Avebury parish. The ancient Ridgeway, now a national trail, begins here and follows the parish boundary northwards.

The medieval Wansdyke earthwork crosses the southernmost part of the parish.

<doc id="1146267" wikidata="Q630426" url="?curid=1146267" title="Geometric quantization">
<text>In mathematical physics, geometric quantization is a mathematical approach to defining a quantum theory corresponding to a given classical theory. It attempts to carry out quantization, for which there is in general no exact recipe, in such a way that certain analogies between the classical theory and the quantum theory remain manifest. For example, the similarity between the Heisenberg equation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics and the Hamilton equation in classical physics should be built in.

==Origins==
One of the earliest attempts at a natural quantization was Weyl quantization, proposed by Hermann Weyl in 1927. Here, an attempt is made to associate a quantum-mechanical observable (a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space) with a real-valued function on classical phase space. The position and momentum in this phase space are mapped to the generators of the Heisenberg group, and the Hilbert space appears as a group representation of the Heisenberg group. In 1946, H. J. Groenewold considered the product of a pair of such observables and asked what the corresponding function would be on the classical phase space. This led him to discover the phase-space star-product of a pair of functions.

The modern theory of geometric quantization was developed by Bertram Kostant and Jean-Marie Souriau in the 1970s. One of the motivations of the theory was to understand and generalize Kirillov&#x27;s orbit method in representation theory.

==Types==
The geometric quantization procedure falls into the following three steps: prequantization, polarization, and metaplectic correction. Prequantization produces a natural Hilbert space together with a quantization procedure for observables that exactly transforms Poisson brackets on the classical side into commutators on the quantum side. Nevertheless, the prequantum Hilbert space is generally understood to be &quot;too big&quot;. The idea is that one should then select a Poisson-commuting set of &quot;n&quot; variables on the 2&quot;n&quot;-dimensional phase space and consider functions (or, more properly, sections) that depend only on these &quot;n&quot; variables. The &quot;n&quot; variables can be either real-valued, resulting in a position-style Hilbert space, or complex analytic, producing something like the Segal–Bargmann space.
A polarization is a coordinate-independent description of such a choice of &quot;n&quot; Poisson-commuting functions. The metaplectic correction (also known as the half-form correction) is a technical modification of the above procedure that is necessary in the case of real polarizations and often convenient for complex polarizations.

===Prequantization===
Suppose formula_1 is a symplectic manifold with symplectic form formula_2. Suppose at first that formula_2 is exact, meaning that there is a globally defined &quot;symplectic potential&quot; formula_4 with formula_5. We can consider the &quot;prequantum Hilbert space&quot; of square-integrable functions on formula_6 (with respect to the Liouville volume measure). For each smooth function formula_7 on formula_6, we can define the Kostant–Souriau prequantum operator
:formula_9.
where formula_10 is the Hamiltonian vector field associated to formula_7.

More generally, suppose formula_1 has the property that the integral of formula_13 over any closed surface is an integer. Then we can construct a line bundle formula_14 with connection whose curvature 2-form is formula_15. In that case, the prequantum Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable sections of formula_14, and we replace the formula for formula_17 above with
:formula_18,
with formula_19 the connection.
The prequantum operators satisfy
:formula_20
for all smooth functions formula_7 and formula_22.

The construction of the preceding Hilbert space and the operators formula_17 is known as &quot;prequantization&quot;.

===Polarization===
The next step in the process of geometric quantization is the choice of a polarization. A polarization is a choice at each point in formula_6 a Lagrangian subspace of the complexified tangent space of formula_6. The subspaces should form an integrable distribution, meaning that the commutator of two vector fields lying in the subspace at each point should also lie in the subspace at each point. The &quot;quantum&quot; (as opposed to prequantum) Hilbert space is the space of sections of formula_14 that are covariantly constant in the direction of the polarization.
The idea is that in the quantum Hilbert space, the sections should be functions of only formula_27 variables on the formula_28-dimensional classical phase space.

If formula_7 is a function for which the associated Hamiltonian flow preserves the polarization, then formula_17 will preserve the quantum Hilbert space.
The assumption that the flow of formula_7 preserve the polarization is a strong one. Typically not very many functions will satisfy this assumption.

===Half-form correction===
The half-form correction—also known as the metaplectic correction—is a technical modification to the above procedure that is necessary in the case of real polarizations to obtain a nonzero quantum Hilbert space; it is also often useful in the complex case. The line bundle formula_14 is replaced by the tensor product of formula_14 with the square root of the canonical bundle of the polarization. In the case of the vertical polarization, for example, instead of considering functions formula_34 of formula_35 that are independent of formula_36, one considers objects of the form formula_37. The formula for formula_17 must then be supplemented by an additional Lie derivative term.
In the case of a complex polarization on the plane, for example, the half-form correction allows the quantization of the harmonic oscillator to reproduce the standard quantum mechanical formula for the energies, formula_39, with the &quot;formula_40&quot; coming courtesy of the half-forms.

===Poisson manifolds===
Geometric quantization of Poisson manifolds and symplectic foliations also is developed. For instance, this is the case of partially integrable and superintegrable Hamiltonian systems and non-autonomous mechanics.

==Example==
In the case that the symplectic manifold is the 2-sphere, it can be realized as a coadjoint orbit in formula_41. Assuming that the area of the sphere is an integer multiple of formula_42, we can perform geometric quantization and the resulting Hilbert space carries an irreducible representation of SU(2). In the case that the area of the sphere is formula_42, we obtain the two-dimensional spin-1/2 representation.

==Generalization==
More generally, this technique leads to deformation quantization, where the ★-product is taken to be a deformation of the algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold or Poisson manifold. However, as a natural quantization scheme (a functor), Weyl&#x27;s map is not satisfactory. For example, the Weyl map of the classical angular-momentum-squared is not just the quantum angular momentum squared operator, but it further contains a constant term 3ħ2/2. (This extra term is actually physically significant, since it accounts for the nonvanishing angular momentum of the ground-state Bohr orbit in the hydrogen atom.) As a mere representation change, however, Weyl&#x27;s map underlies the alternate phase-space formulation of conventional quantum mechanics.

<text>Alexander Francis Chamberlain (January 12, 1865April 8, 1914) was a Canadian anthropologist, born in England. Under the direction of Franz Boas he received the first Ph.D. granted in anthropology in the United States from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. After graduating, he taught at Clark, eventually becoming full professor in 1911. Under the auspices of the British Association, his area of specialty was the Kootenay (British Columbia) Indians.

== Early life and education ==
Alexander Francis Chamberlain was born in Kenninghall, Norfolk, England, the eldest child of George and Maria Anderton Chamberlain. His family emigrated to North America when he was a child, settling in Bushnell&#x27;s Basin, New York, where he began schooling. After about a year, his family relocated to Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, where Chamberlain attended the Union School and the Peterborough Collegiate Institute. He then studied modern languages at the University of Toronto, graduating with a B.A. in 1886.

== Career ==
Chamberlain was well known in anthropology for his bibliographic work, compiling the lists of new books and articles that appeared in the early issues of the &quot;American Anthropologist&quot; and later the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot;. He was editor of the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot; between 1901 and 1908. His works include:
* &quot;Report on the Kootenay Indians&quot;, (1892)
* &quot;Languages of the Mississaga Indians&quot;, (1892)
* &quot;The Mythology of the Columbian Discovery&quot;, (1893)
* &quot;Child and Childhood in Folk-Thought&quot;, (1896)
* &quot;The Child: A Study in the Evolution of Man&quot;, (1900)
* &quot;Poems&quot;, (1904)
He also contributed to the second edition of the New International Encyclopedia on South American Indians and Asiatic peoples, and to 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica on North American Indians. Chamberlain was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1902.

<doc id="1146278" wikidata="Q3108829" url="?curid=1146278" title="Glenn Tilbrook">
<text>Glenn Martin Tilbrook (born 31 August 1957, in Woolwich, London) is an English singer, songwriter and guitarist. He is the lead singer and guitarist of the English new wave band Squeeze, a band formed in the mid-1970s who broke through in the new wave era at the decade&#x27;s end. He generally writes the music for Squeeze&#x27;s songs, while his writing partner, Chris Difford, writes the lyrics. In addition to his songwriting skills, Tilbrook is respected both as a singer and an accomplished guitarist.

==Squeeze==
Tilbrook formed Squeeze with fellow guitarist and vocalist Chris Difford in the mid-1970s. Difford had placed an advertisement at a local shop looking for a guitarist and Tilbrook was the only person to respond. Tilbrook also recruited school friend Jools Holland to join the band in its early stages.

Tilbrook and Difford would ultimately form a songwriting partnership that is responsible for writing most Squeeze songs, with Tilbrook writing music and Difford writing lyrics. Tilbrook also serves as lead guitarist and performs guitar solos on the band&#x27;s music. On his guitar style, Tilbrook commented:

In 1982 Squeeze had disbanded. The chemistry between Tilbrook and Difford could not be as easily dismissed however, and the ensuing record they made together in 1984 has become the “lost” Squeeze album for many fans. However, the partnership began to fray under the duress of Difford&#x27;s struggles with addiction and questions over the band&#x27;s commercial and creative direction. The band would again break up in 1999 and remain dormant until a reunion in 2007.

==Difford and Tilbrook==
During Squeeze&#x27;s first hiatus, from approximately 1983 to 1985, Tilbrook wrote, recorded, and toured with Difford as Difford &amp; Tilbrook. Their album, &quot;Difford &amp; Tilbrook&quot; was released in 1984, and remastered and reissued in 2006.

==Solo career and outside Squeeze==
Tilbrook contributed guitar on 1976 demos for punk band The Only Ones.

Tilbrook, alongside Chris Difford, appeared on several songs on the 1995 album &quot;I&#x27;m With Stupid&quot;, including most notably the single &quot;That&#x27;s Just What You Are&quot;, by American alternative rock singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, with both contributing backing vocals, and Tilbrook playing lead guitar.

On 18 June 1996, before the Euro &#x27;96 England vs. The Netherlands match at Wembley Stadium, Tilbrook appeared on ITV to sing the national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.

Following Squeeze&#x27;s second breakup in 1999, Tilbrook pursued a solo career, often touring around the UK and US in an RV, playing small venues. He released two solo albums, &quot;The Incomplete Glenn Tilbrook&quot; and &quot;Transatlantic Ping Pong.&quot; Tilbrook co-wrote some of the songs for his solo recordings with artists such as Ron Sexsmith, Chris Braide and Aimee Mann.
In 2006, the film documentary &quot;Glenn Tilbrook: One for the Road&quot; was released. It followed Tilbrook on his November 2001 tour across the United States. In 2007, Tilbrook took time off from his solo career to tour once again with Squeeze who had reformed for the third time.

In April 2007, Tilbrook released &quot;The Past Has Been Bottled,&quot; the first in a five-disc series of remastered demos. The first release included early versions of tracks from Squeeze&#x27;s &quot;East Side Story.&quot; The second volume, &quot;In The Sky Above,&quot; was released in the UK in November 2007, and covered the period from 1993 through 1998. The third volume, &quot;Dreams Are Made of This,&quot; was released in November 2009 and covered Squeeze&#x27;s early years, from 1974 to 1980. The fourth volume &quot;When Daylight Appears,&quot; was released in 2011 and covered the years 1985 to 1991. The fifth volume, &quot;Upon The Rocks,&quot; was released in 2016 and covered the years 1981 to 1984.

In 2008, Tilbrook previewed new material while on tour with the Fluffers, two members of whom are also members of the latest Squeeze line-up. A four-track single &quot;Binga Bong!&quot; was released in November 2008. The album &quot;Pandemonium Ensues,&quot; credited to Glenn Tilbrook and The Fluffers, was released in March 2009. The 14-track album was produced by Tilbrook and Andrew J. Jones, and mixed by Bob Clearmountain. It featured guest appearances from Johnny Depp on &quot;Too Close to the Sun&quot; and Depp&#x27;s then girlfriend, Vanessa Paradis, on &quot;Interest &amp; Love.&quot;

In January 2010 it was announced that Tilbrook and Difford would be spending part of the coming summer in Italy, together writing songs for a new Squeeze album. The result of this was a 4-song CD of new demo recordings which emerged during their 2012 tour of the US. The duo toured the UK and US again in 2014–15 with a program they called &#x27;The At Odds Couple&#x27;.

In 2014, Tilbrook released a mostly acoustic album titled &quot;Happy Ending,&quot; Later that year, he was featured on the compilation &quot;Songs from a Stolen Spring&quot; that paired Western musicians with artists from the Arab Spring. On the album, Tilbrook&#x27;s performance of the Bob Marley and Peter Tosh song &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; was meshed with Egyptian singer Dina El Wedidi&#x27;s &quot;Beyond These Doors&quot;.

==Fluffers==

The Fluffers is the name of Tilbrook&#x27;s band when he performs without Squeeze. They tour internationally, and consist of Tilbrook, Stephen Large (keyboards), Simon Hanson (drums) and Lucy Shaw (electric bass).

==Personal life==
Tilbrook was born in Woolwich, London on 31 August 1957.

Tilbrook has his own recording studio, 45RPM, in Charlton. It has been used by other bands such as Nine Below Zero. Tilbrook supports Charlton Athletic F.C. and in 1998 Squeeze released &quot;Down in the Valley&quot;, a tribute to his boyhood team.

Tilbrook is a supporter of the Love Hope Strength Foundation, a cancer charity founded by Mike Peters of The Alarm, and has played concerts in aid of the organisation, including one at base camp, Mount Everest.

He was married to Pam Baker in the early and mid-1980s; the couple struggled with heroin abuse. They had two sons. He is now married to Suzanne Hunt, with whom he had another son. All three of his sons are musicians.

<doc id="1146288" wikidata="Q935481" url="?curid=1146288" title="Loyalist (American Revolution)">
<text>Loyalists were colonists in the Thirteen Colonies who remained loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolution, often referred to as Tories, Royalists, or King&#x27;s Men at the time. They were opposed by the Patriots or Whigs, who supported the revolution and considered them &quot;persons inimical to the liberties of America.&quot;

Prominent Loyalists repeatedly assured the British government that many thousands of them would spring to arms and fight for the Crown. The British government acted in expectation of that, especially during the Southern campaigns of 1780 and 1781. Britain was able to effectively protect the people only in areas where they had military control, thus the number of military Loyalists was significantly lower than what had been expected. Loyalists were often under suspicion of those in the British military, who did not know whom they could fully trust in such a conflicted situation; they were often looked down upon.

Patriots watched suspected Loyalists very closely and would not tolerate any organized Loyalist opposition. Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee, especially to their stronghold of New York City. William Franklin, the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader Benjamin Franklin, became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778. He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war. Woodrow Wilson writes: &quot;there had been no less than twenty-five thousand loyalists enlisted in the British service during the five years of the fighting. At one time (1779) they had actually outnumbered the whole of the continental muster under the personal command of Washington.&quot;When their cause was defeated, about 15 percent of the Loyalists (65,000–70,000 people) fled to other parts of the British Empire; especially to the Kingdom of Great Britain or to British North America and became known as United Empire Loyalists. Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures. The southern Loyalists moved mostly to East or West Florida or to British Caribbean possessions. Loyalists who left the US received over £3 million or about 37% of their losses from the British government. Loyalists who stayed in the US were generally able to retain their property and become American citizens. Many Loyalists eventually returned to the US after the war and after discriminatory laws had been repealed. Historians have estimated that between 15% and 20% (300,000 to 400,000) of the 2,000,000 whites in the colonies in 1775 were Loyalists.

==Background==
Families were often divided during the American Revolution, and many felt themselves to be both American and British, still owing loyalty to the mother country. Maryland lawyer Daniel Dulaney the Younger opposed taxation without representation but would not break his oath to the king or take up arms against him. He wrote: &quot;There may be a time when redress may not be obtained. Till then, I shall recommend a legal, orderly, and prudent resentment&quot;. Most Americans hoped for a peaceful reconciliation but were forced to choose sides by the Patriots who took control nearly everywhere in the Thirteen Colonies in 1775–76.

==Motives for loyalism==
In 1948, Yale historian Leonard Woods Larabee identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative and loyal to the king and to Britain:
* They were older, better established, and resisted radical change.
* They felt that rebellion against the Crown—the legitimate government—was morally wrong. They saw themselves as &quot;British born in the colonies&quot; loyal to the British Empire and saw a rebellion against the metropole (Great Britain) as a betrayal to the empire. At the time the national identity of the Americans was still in formation, and the very idea of two separate peoples (nationalities) with their own sovereign states (the Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of America) was itself revolutionary. Eventually and gradually, as the war progressed and it became clear that the United States and Great Britain would become two separate countries, the Loyalists who remained in the United States adopted the national identity as Americans.
* They felt alienated when the Patriots (seen by them as separatists who rebelled against the Crown) resorted to violence, such as burning down houses and tarring and feathering.
* They wanted to take a middle-of-the-road position and were not pleased when forced by Patriots to declare their opposition.
* They had business and family links with Britain, and being a part of the British Empire was crucial in terms of commerce and their business operations.
* They felt that independence from Britain would come eventually but wanted it to come about organically.
* They were wary that chaos, corruption, and mob rule would come about as a result of revolution.
* Some were &quot;pessimists&quot; who did not display the same belief in the future that the Patriots did. Others recalled the dreadful experiences of many Jacobites after the failure of their 1715 and 1745 rebellions, who often had their lands confiscated by the Hanoverian government.

Other motives of the Loyalists included:
* They felt a need for order and believed that Parliament was the legitimate authority.
* In New York, powerful families had assembled colony-wide coalitions of supporters; the de Lancey family (of Huguenot and New York Dutch ancestry) formed De Lancey&#x27;s Brigade with support from its associates.
* They felt weak or threatened within American society and in need of an outside defender such as the British Crown and Parliament.
* Black Loyalists were promised freedom from slavery by the British.

== Demographics ==
Historian Robert Calhoon wrote in 2000, concerning the proportion of Loyalists to Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies:

Before Calhoon&#x27;s work, estimates of the Loyalist share of the population were somewhat higher, at about one-third, but these estimates are now rejected as too high by most scholars. In 1968 historian Paul H. Smith estimated there were about 400,000 Loyalists, or 16% of the white population of 2.25 million in 1780.

Historian Robert Middlekauff summarizes scholarly research on the nature of Loyalist support as follows:

The largest number of loyalists were found in the middle colonies: many tenant farmers of New York supported the king, for example, as did many of the Dutch in the colony and in New Jersey. The Germans in Pennsylvania tried to stay out of the Revolution, just as many Quakers did, and when that failed, clung to the familiar connection rather than embrace the new. Highland Scots in the Carolinas, a fair number of Anglican clergy and their parishioners in Connecticut and New York, a few Presbyterians in the southern colonies, and a large number of the Iroquois stayed loyal to the king.

After the British military capture of New York City and Long Island it became the British military and political base of operations in North America from 1776 to 1783, prompting revolutionaries to flee and resulting in a large concentration of Loyalists, many of whom were refugees from other states.

According to Calhoon, Loyalists tended to be older and wealthier, but there were also many Loyalists of humble means. Many active Church of England members became Loyalists. Some recent arrivals from Britain, especially those from Scotland, had a high Loyalist proportion. Loyalists in the southern colonies were suppressed by the local Patriots, who controlled local and state government. Many people—including former Regulators in North Carolina—refused to join the rebellion, as they had earlier protested against corruption by local authorities who later became Revolutionary leaders. The oppression by the local Whigs during the Regulation led to many of the residents of backcountry North Carolina sitting out the Revolution or siding with the Loyalists.

In areas under Patriot control, Loyalists were subject to confiscation of property, and outspoken supporters of the king were threatened with public humiliation such as tarring and feathering or physical attack. It is not known how many Loyalist civilians were harassed by the Patriots, but the treatment was a warning to other Loyalists not to take up arms. In September 1775, William Drayton and Loyalist leader Colonel Thomas Fletchall signed a treaty of neutrality in the interior community of Ninety Six, South Carolina. For actively aiding the British army when it occupied Philadelphia, two residents of the city were tried for treason, convicted, and executed by returning Patriot forces.

===Blacks===

As a result of the looming crisis in 1775, Royal Governor of Virginia Lord Dunmore issued a proclamation that promised freedom to indentured servants and slaves who were able to bear arms and join his Loyalist Ethiopian Regiment. Many of the slaves in the South joined the Loyalists with intentions of gaining freedom and escaping the South. African-Americans were often the first to come forward to volunteer, and a total of 12,000 African Americans served with the British from 1775 to 1783. This forced the Patriots to also offer freedom to those who would serve in the Continental Army, with thousands of Black Patriots serving.

=== Women ===
While men were out fighting for the Crown, women served at home protecting their land and property. At the end of the war, many Loyalist men left America for the shelter of England, leaving their wives and daughters to protect their land. The main punishment for Loyalist families was the expropriation of property, but married women were protected under &quot;feme covert&quot;, which meant that they had no political identity and their legal rights were absorbed by their husbands. This created an awkward dilemma for the confiscation committees: confiscating the land of such a woman would punish her for her husband&#x27;s actions. In many cases, the women did not get a choice on if they were labeled a Loyalist or a Patriot; the label was dependent on their husband&#x27;s political association. However, some women showed their loyalty to the Crown by continually purchasing British goods, writing it down, and showing resistance to the Patriots. Grace Growden Galloway recorded the experience in her diary. Her writings show the difficulties that her family faced during the revolution. Galloway&#x27;s property was seized by the Patriots, and she spent the rest of her life fighting to regain it. It was returned to her heirs in 1783, after she and her husband had died.

Patriots allowed women to become involved in politics in a larger scale than the Loyalists. Some women involved in political activity include Catharine Macaulay and Mercy Otis Warren who were both writers. Both women maintained a 20-year friendship although they wrote about different sides of the war; Macaulay wrote from a Loyalist British perspective whereas Warren wrote about her support for the American Revolution. Macaulay&#x27;s work include &quot;History of England&quot; and Warren wrote &quot;History of the Rise&quot;, &quot;Progress&quot;, and &quot;Termination of the American Revolution.&quot; Although both women&#x27;s works were unpopular during this time, it pushed them to learn from social critique.

===Canada and Nova Scotia===
Patriot agents were active in Quebec (which was then frequently called &quot;Canada&quot;, the name of the earlier French province) in the months leading to the outbreak of active hostilities. John Brown, an agent of the Boston Committee of Correspondence, worked with Canadian merchant Thomas Walker and other Patriot sympathisers during the winter of 1774–75 to convince inhabitants to support the actions of the First Continental Congress. However, many of Quebec&#x27;s inhabitants remained neutral, resisting service to either the British or the Americans.

Although some Canadians took up arms in support of the revolution, the majority remained loyal to the king. French Canadians had been satisfied by the British government&#x27;s Quebec Act of 1774, which offered religious and linguistic toleration; in general, they did not sympathize with a revolution that they saw as being led by Protestants from New England, who were their commercial rivals and hereditary enemies. Most of the English-speaking settlers had arrived following the British conquest of Canada in 1759–60 and were unlikely to support separation from Britain. The older British colonies, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (including what is now New Brunswick) also remained loyal and contributed military forces in support of the Crown.

In late 1775 the Continental Army sent a force into Quebec, led by General Richard Montgomery and Colonel Benedict Arnold, with the goal of convincing the residents of Quebec to join the revolution. Although only a minority of Canadians openly expressed loyalty to King George, about 1,500 militia fought for the king in the siege of Fort St. Jean. In the region south of Montreal which was occupied by the Continentals, some inhabitants supported the revolution and raised two regiments to join the Patriot forces.

In Nova Scotia, there were many Yankee settlers originally from New England, and they generally supported the principles of the revolution. The allegiance toward the revolution waned as American privateers raided Nova Scotia communities throughout the war. The Nova Scotia government used the law to convict people for sedition and treason for supporting the Patriot cause. There was also the influence of an influx of recent immigration from the British isles, and they remained neutral during the war, and the influx was greatest in Halifax. Britain in any case built up powerful forces at the naval base of Halifax after the failure of Jonathan Eddy to capture Fort Cumberland in 1776. 

==Military operations==
The Loyalists rarely attempted any political organization. They were often passive unless regular British army units were in the area. The British, however, assumed a highly activist Loyalist community was ready to mobilize and planned much of their strategy around raising Loyalist regiments. The British provincial line, consisting of Americans enlisted on a regular army status, enrolled 19,000 Loyalists (50 units and 312 companies). The maximum strength of the Loyalist provincial line was 9,700 in December 1780. In all about 19,000 at one time or another were soldiers or militia in British forces. 

In the opening months of the Revolutionary War, the Patriots laid siege to Boston, where most of the British forces were stationed. Elsewhere there were few British troops, and the Patriots seized control of all levels of government, as well as supplies of arms and gunpowder. Vocal Loyalists recruited people to their side, often with the encouragement and assistance of royal governors. In the South Carolina backcountry, Loyalist recruitment outstripped that of Patriots. A brief siege at Ninety Six, South Carolina in the fall of 1775 was followed by a rapid rise in Patriot recruiting. In what became known as the Snow Campaign, partisan militia arrested or drove out most of the backcountry Loyalist leadership. North Carolina backcountry Scots and former Regulators joined forces in early 1776, but they were broken as a force at the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge. Loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the Battle of Camden. The British forces at the Battle of Monck&#x27;s Corner and the Battle of Lenud&#x27;s Ferry consisted entirely of Loyalists with the exception of their commanding officer Banastre Tarleton. Both white and black Loyalists fought for the British at the Battle of Kemp&#x27;s Landing in Virginia.

By July 4, 1776, the Patriots had gained control of virtually all territory in the Thirteen Colonies and had expelled all royal officials. No one who openly proclaimed their loyalty to the Crown was allowed to remain, so Loyalists fled or kept quiet. Some of those who remained later gave aid to invading British armies or joined uniformed Loyalist regiments. The British were forced out of Boston by March 17, 1776. They regrouped at Halifax and attacked New York in August, defeating George Washington&#x27;s army at Long Island and capturing New York City and its vicinity, and they occupied the mouth of the Hudson River until 1783. British forces seized control of other cities, including Philadelphia (1777), Savannah, Georgia (1778–83), and Charleston, South Carolina (1780–82). But 90% of the colonial population lived outside the cities, with the effective result that Congress represented 80 to 90 percent of the population. The British removed their governors from colonies where the Patriots were in control, but Loyalist civilian government was re-established in coastal Georgia from 1779 to 1782, despite the presence of Patriot forces in the northern part of Georgia. Essentially, the British were only able to maintain power in areas where they had a strong military presence.

Black Loyalists helped rout the Virginia militia at the Battle of Kemp&#x27;s Landing and fought in the Battle of Great Bridge on the Elizabeth River, wearing the motto &quot;Liberty to Slaves&quot;, but this time they were defeated. The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of Norfolk, after which they served in the Chesapeake area. Eventually the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases. This took a heavy toll, putting many of them out of action for some time. The survivors joined other Loyalist units and continued to serve throughout the war. 

In Canada, although the Continentals captured Montreal in November 1775, they were turned back a month later at Quebec City by a combination of the British military under Governor Guy Carleton, the difficult terrain and weather, and an indifferent local response. The Continental forces would be driven from Quebec in 1776, after the breakup of ice on the St. Lawrence River and the arrival of British transports in May and June. There would be no further serious attempt to challenge British control of present-day Canada until the War of 1812. In 1777, 1,500 Loyalist militia took part in the Saratoga campaign in New York, and surrendered with General Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga in October. For the rest of the war, Quebec acted as a base for raiding expeditions, conducted primarily by Loyalists and Indians, against frontier communities.

== Aftermath of the American Revolution ==

=== Emigration ===

Estimates for how many Loyalists emigrated after the war differ. Historian Maya Jasanoff calculates 60,000 in total went to British North America, including about 50,000 whites. Philip Ranlet estimates 20,000 adult white Loyalists went to Canada, while Wallace Brown cites about 80,000 Loyalists in total permanently left the United States.

According to Jasanoff, about 36,000 Loyalists went to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, while about 6,600 went to Quebec and 2,000 to Prince Edward Island. About 5,090 white Loyalists went to Florida, bringing along their slaves who numbered about 8,285 (421 whites and 2,561 blacks returned to the US from Florida). When Florida was returned to Spain, however, very few Loyalists remained there. Approximately 6,000 whites went to Jamaica and other Caribbean islands, notably the Bahama Islands, and about 13,000 went to Britain (including 5,000 free blacks).

A precise figure cannot be known because the records were incomplete and inaccurate, and small numbers continued to leave after 1783. The 50,000 or so white departures represented about 10% of the Loyalists (at 20–25% of the white population). Loyalists (especially soldiers and former officials) could choose evacuation. Loyalists whose roots were not yet deeply embedded in the United States were more likely to leave; older people who had familial bonds and had acquired friends, property, and a degree of social respectability were more likely to remain in the US. The vast majority of the half-million white Loyalists, about 20–25% of the total number of whites, remained in the US. Starting in the mid-1780s a small percentage of those who had left returned to the United States. The exiles amounted to about 2% of the total US population of 3 million at the end of the war in 1783.

After 1783 some former Loyalists, especially Germans from Pennsylvania, emigrated to Canada to take advantage of the British government&#x27;s offer of free land. Many departed the fledgling United States because they faced continuing hostility. In another migration-motivated mainly by economic rather than political reasons- more than 20,000 and perhaps as many as 30,000 &quot;Late Loyalists&quot; arrived in Ontario in the 1790s attracted by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe&#x27;s policy of land and low taxes, one-fifth those in the US and swearing an oath of allegiance to the king.

The 36,000 or so who went to Nova Scotia were not well received by the 17,000 Nova Scotians, who were mostly descendants of New Englanders settled there before the Revolution. &quot;They [the Loyalists]&quot;, Colonel Thomas Dundas wrote in 1786, &quot;have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of Nova Scotia, who are even more disaffected towards the British Government than any of the new States ever were. This makes me much doubt their remaining long dependent.&quot; In response, the colony of New Brunswick, until 1784 part of Nova Scotia, was created for the 14,000 who had settled in those parts. Of the 46,000 who went to Canada, 10,000 went to Quebec, especially what is now modern-day Ontario, the rest to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

Realizing the importance of some type of consideration, on November 9, 1789, Governor of Quebec Lord Dorchester declared that it was his wish to &quot;put the mark of Honour upon the Families who had adhered to the Unity of the Empire.&quot; As a result of Dorchester&#x27;s statement, the printed militia rolls carried the notation:

Those Loyalists who have adhered to the Unity of the Empire, and joined the Royal Standard before the Treaty of Separation in the year 1783, and all their Children and their Descendants by either sex, are to be distinguished by the following Capitals, affixed to their names: U.E. Alluding to their great principle The Unity of the Empire.

The post-nominals &quot;U.E.&quot; are rarely seen today, but the influence of the Loyalists on the evolution of Canada remains. Their ties to Britain and/or their antipathy to the United States provided the strength needed to keep Canada independent and distinct in North America. The Loyalists&#x27; basic distrust of republicanism and &quot;mob rule&quot; influenced Canada&#x27;s gradual path to independence. The new British North American provinces of Upper Canada (the forerunner of Ontario) and New Brunswick were founded as places of refuge for the United Empire Loyalists.

In an interesting historical twist Peter Matthews, a son of Loyalists, participated in the Upper Canada Rebellion which sought relief from oligarchic British colonial government and pursued American style republicanism. He was arrested, tried and executed in Toronto, and later became heralded as a patriot to the movement which led to Canadian self-governance. 

The wealthiest and most prominent Loyalist exiles went to Great Britain to rebuild their careers; many received pensions. Many Southern Loyalists, taking along their slaves, went to the West Indies, particularly to the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas. Certain Loyalists who fled the United States brought their slaves with them to Canada (mostly to areas that later became Ontario and New Brunswick) where slavery was legal. An imperial law in 1790 assured prospective immigrants to Canada that their slaves would remain their property. However, a law enacted by eminent British lieutenant general and founder of modern Toronto John Graves Simcoe in 1793 entitled the Act Against Slavery tried to suppress slavery in Upper Canada by halting the sale of slaves to the United States, and by freeing slaves upon their escape from the latter into Canada. Simcoe desired to demonstrate the merits of loyalism and abolitionism in Upper Canada in contrast to the nascent republicanism and prominence of slavery in the United States, and, according to historian Stanley R. Mealing:

However the actual law was a compromise. According to historian Afua Cooper, Simcoe&#x27;s law required children in slavery to be freed when they reached age 25 and:

Thousands of Iroquois and other Native Americans were expelled from New York and other states and resettled in Canada. The descendants of one such group of Iroquois, led by Joseph Brant (Thayendenegea), settled at Six Nations of the Grand River, the largest First Nations reserve in Canada. (The remainder, under the leadership of Cornplanter (John Abeel) and members of his family, stayed in New York.) A group of African-American Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia but emigrated again for Sierra Leone after facing discrimination there.

Many of the Loyalists were forced to abandon substantial properties to America restoration of or compensation for these lost properties, which was a major issue during the negotiation of the Jay Treaty in 1794. Two successive boards were formed, and under a new convention signed in 1802 by the United States and Great Britain for the mutual payment of claims, the US paid the sum of £600,000, while only £1,420,000 of nearly £5 million in claims considered by commissioners in Britain were judged to be good.

For the Black Loyalists, the British honored the pledge of freedom in New York City through the efforts of General Guy Carleton, who recorded the names of African Americans who had supported the British in a document called the Book of Negroes, which granted freedom to slaves who had escaped and assisted the British. About 4,000 Black Loyalists went to the British colonies of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where they were promised land grants. They founded communities across the two provinces, many of which still exist today. Over 2,500 settled in Birchtown, Nova Scotia, instantly making it the largest free black community in North America. However, the long period of waiting time to be officially given land grants that were given to them and the prejudices of white Loyalists in nearby Shelburne who regularly harassed the settlement in events such as the Shelburne riots in 1784, made life very difficult for the community. In 1791 the Sierra Leone Company offered to transport dissatisfied black Loyalists to the nascent colony of Sierra Leone in West Africa, with the promise of better land and more equality. About 1,200 left Nova Scotia for Sierra Leone, where they named the capital Freetown. After 1787 they became Sierra Leone&#x27;s ruling elite during the colonial era and their descendants, the Sierra Leone Creoles, are the cultural elites of the nation. About 400 to 1,000 free blacks who joined the British side in the Revolution went to London and joined the free black community of about 10,000 there.

=== United States citizens ===
The great majority of Loyalists never left the United States; they stayed on and were allowed to be citizens of the new country, retaining for a time the earlier designation of &quot;Tories&quot;. Some became nationally prominent leaders, including Samuel Seabury, who was the first Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and Tench Coxe. There was a small but significant trickle of returnees who found life in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick too difficult. Perhaps 10% of the refugees to New Brunswick returned to the States as did an unknown number from Nova Scotia. Some Massachusetts Tories settled in the Maine District. Nevertheless, the vast majority never returned. Captain Benjamin Hallowell, who as Mandamus Councilor in Massachusetts served as the direct representative of the Crown, was considered by the insurgents as one of the most hated men in the Colony, but as a token of compensation when he returned from England in 1796, his son was allowed to regain the family house.

In many states, moderate Whigs, who had not been in favor of separation from Britain but preferred a negotiated settlement which would have maintained ties to the Mother Country, aligned with Tories to block radicals. Among these was Alexander Hamilton in 1782–85, to wrest control of New York State from the faction of the George Clinton. Most states had rescinded anti-Tory laws by 1787, although the accusation of being a Tory was heard for another generation. Several hundred who had left for Florida returned to Georgia in 1783–84. 

South Carolina, which had seen a bitter bloody internal civil war in 1780–82, adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4,500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of the property. The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for the confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven. 

In Connecticut, much to the disgust of the radical Whigs, the moderate Whigs were advertising in New York newspapers in 1782–83 that Tories who would make no trouble would be welcome on the grounds that their skills and money would help the state&#x27;s economy. The moderates prevailed; all anti-Tory laws were repealed in early 1783 except for the law relating to confiscated Tory estates: &quot;... the problem of the loyalists after 1783 was resolved in their favor after the War of Independence ended.&quot; In 1787 the last of any discriminatory laws were rescinded.

=== Effect of the departure of Loyalist leaders ===

The departure of so many royal officials, rich merchants and landed gentry destroyed the hierarchical networks that had dominated most of the colonies. A major result was that a Patriot/Whig elite supplanted royal officials and affluent Tories. In New York, the departure of key members of the De Lancey, De Peyster, Walton and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley. Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of powerful families—Penn, Allen, Chew, Shippen—destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class there. Massachusetts passed an act banishing 46 Boston merchants in 1778, including members of some of Boston&#x27;s wealthiest families. The departure of families such as the Ervings, Winslows, Clarks, and Lloyds deprived Massachusetts of men who had hitherto been leaders of networks of family and clients. The bases of the men who replaced them were much different. One rich Patriot in Boston noted in 1779 that &quot;fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago, have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots.&quot; New men became rich merchants but they shared a spirit of republican equality that replaced the former elitism.

The Patriot reliance on Catholic France for military, financial and diplomatic aid led to a sharp drop in anti-Catholic rhetoric. Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon Patriots had to fight against. Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war most remained in the new nation. By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. &quot;In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.&quot;

<text>Concepción is one of two volcanoes (along with Maderas) that form the island of Ometepe, which is situated in Lake Nicaragua in Nicaragua, Central America.

Concepción is an active stratovolcano that forms the northwest part of the Isla de Ometepe. Concepción is tall and rests on a thick base of Quaternary lacustrine mudstones. It is considered a &quot;pristine&quot; volcano because there has been no influence of other volcanoes on its growth, and its cone is highly symmetrical. The growth of the volcano comes in phases based on weaknesses of the crust that the volcano rests on. As it grows from additional magma flow, the volcano grows in mass and exerts pressure on the crust. This causes shifts which in turn cause more volcanic growth. This affects the magma chamber which begins the cycle again with growth because of magmatic flow.

Since 1883, Concepción has erupted at least 25 times; its last eruption was on 16 May 2024. Concepción&#x27;s eruptions are characterized by frequent, moderate-sized explosions. Active fumaroles are present just north of Concepción&#x27;s summit crater.

Adventure seekers from all over the world travel to Ometepe Island to climb Volcán Concepción. There are numerous trails in the tropical forest that surrounds the volcano&#x27;s ash-covered peak.

<text>In mathematics, a Kac–Moody algebra (named for Victor Kac and Robert Moody, who independently and simultaneously discovered them in 1968) is a Lie algebra, usually infinite-dimensional, that can be defined by generators and relations through a generalized Cartan matrix. These algebras form a generalization of finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras, and many properties related to the structure of a Lie algebra such as its root system, irreducible representations, and connection to flag manifolds have natural analogues in the Kac–Moody setting.

A class of Kac–Moody algebras called [[affine Lie algebra]]s is of particular importance in mathematics and theoretical physics, especially two-dimensional conformal field theory and the theory of exactly solvable models. Kac discovered an elegant proof of certain combinatorial identities, the Macdonald identities, which is based on the representation theory of affine Kac–Moody algebras. Howard Garland and James Lepowsky demonstrated that Rogers–Ramanujan identities can be derived in a similar fashion.

== History of Kac–Moody algebras ==
The initial construction by Élie Cartan and Wilhelm Killing of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras from the Cartan integers was type dependent. In 1966 Jean-Pierre Serre showed that relations of Claude Chevalley and Harish-Chandra, with simplifications by Nathan Jacobson, give a defining presentation for the Lie algebra. One could thus describe a simple Lie algebra in terms of generators and relations using data from the matrix of Cartan integers, which is naturally positive definite.

&quot;Almost simultaneously in 1967, Victor Kac in the USSR and Robert Moody in Canada developed what was to become Kac–Moody algebra. Kac and Moody noticed that if Wilhelm Killing&#x27;s conditions were relaxed, it was still possible to associate to the Cartan matrix a Lie algebra which, necessarily, would be infinite dimensional.&quot; – A. J. Coleman

In his 1967 thesis, Robert Moody considered Lie algebras whose Cartan matrix is no longer positive definite. This still gave rise to a Lie algebra, but one which is now infinite dimensional. Simultaneously, Z-graded Lie algebras were being studied in Moscow where I. L. Kantor introduced and studied a general class of Lie algebras including what eventually became known as Kac–Moody algebras. Victor Kac was also studying simple or nearly simple Lie algebras with polynomial growth. A rich mathematical theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras evolved. An account of the subject, which also includes works of many others is given in (Kac 1990). See also (Seligman 1987).

== Introduction ==
Given an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; generalized Cartan matrix formula_1, one can construct a Lie algebra formula_2 defined by generators formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 and relations given by:
*formula_6 for all formula_7;
*formula_8;
*formula_9;
*formula_10, where formula_11 is the Kronecker delta;
*If formula_12 (so formula_13) then formula_14 and formula_15, where formula_16 is the adjoint representation of formula_17.

Under a &quot;symmetrizability&quot; assumption, formula_2 identifies with the derived subalgebra formula_19 of the affine Kac-Moody algebra formula_20 defined below.

== Definition ==
Assume we are given an formula_21 generalized Cartan matrix of rank &quot;r&quot;. For every such formula_22, there exists a unique up to isomorphism &quot;realization&quot; of formula_22, i.e. a triple formula_24) where formula_25 is a complex vector space, formula_26 is a subset of elements of formula_25, and formula_28 is a subset of the dual space formula_29 satisfying the following three conditions:

# The vector space formula_25 has dimension 2&quot;n&quot; − &quot;r&quot; 
# The sets formula_28 and formula_26 are linearly independent and 
# For every formula_33. 

The formula_34 are analogue to the simple roots of a semi-simple Lie algebra, and the formula_35 to the simple coroots.

Then we define the &quot;Kac-Moody algebra&quot; associated to formula_22 as the Lie algebra formula_37 defined by generators formula_3 and formula_5 and the elements of formula_25 and relations 
*formula_41 for formula_42;
*formula_43, for formula_44;
*formula_45, for formula_44;
*formula_47, where formula_11 is the Kronecker delta;
*If formula_12 (so formula_13) then formula_14 and formula_15, where formula_16 is the adjoint representation of formula_17.

A real (possibly infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra is also considered a Kac–Moody algebra if its complexification is a Kac–Moody algebra.

==Root-space decomposition of a Kac–Moody algebra==
formula_25 is the analogue of a Cartan subalgebra for the Kac–Moody algebra formula_17.

If formula_57 is an element of formula_17 such that

:formula_59

for some formula_60, then formula_61 is called a root vector and formula_62 is a root of formula_17. (The zero functional is not considered a root by convention.) The set of all roots of formula_17 is often denoted by formula_65 and sometimes by formula_66. For a given root formula_62, one denotes by formula_68 the root space of formula_62; that is,

:formula_70.

It follows from the defining relations of formula_17 that formula_72 and formula_73. Also, if formula_74 and formula_75, then formula_76 by the Jacobi identity.

A fundamental result of the theory is that any Kac–Moody algebra can be decomposed into the direct sum of formula_25 and its root spaces, that is

:formula_78,

and that every root formula_62 can be written as formula_80 with all the formula_81 being integers of the same sign.

==Types of Kac–Moody algebras==
Properties of a Kac–Moody algebra are controlled by the algebraic properties of its generalized Cartan matrix &quot;C&quot;. In order to classify Kac–Moody algebras, it is enough to consider the case of an &quot;indecomposable&quot; matrix &quot;C&quot;, that is, assume that there is no decomposition of the set of indices &quot;I&quot; into a disjoint union of non-empty subsets &quot;I&quot;1 and &quot;I&quot;2 such that &quot;C&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;1 and &quot;j&quot; in &quot;I&quot;2. Any decomposition of the generalized Cartan matrix leads to the direct sum decomposition of the corresponding Kac–Moody algebra:

: formula_82

where the two Kac–Moody algebras in the right hand side are associated with the submatrices of &quot;C&quot; corresponding to the index sets &quot;I&quot;1 and &quot;I&quot;2.

An important subclass of Kac–Moody algebras corresponds to &quot;symmetrizable&quot; generalized Cartan matrices &quot;C&quot;, which can be decomposed as &quot;DS&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; is a diagonal matrix with positive integer entries and &quot;S&quot; is a symmetric matrix. Under the assumptions that &quot;C&quot; is symmetrizable and indecomposable, the Kac–Moody algebras are divided into three classes:

*A positive definite matrix &quot;S&quot; gives rise to a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra.
*A positive semidefinite matrix &quot;S&quot; gives rise to an infinite-dimensional Kac–Moody algebra of affine type, or an affine Lie algebra.
*An indefinite matrix &quot;S&quot; gives rise to a Kac–Moody algebra of indefinite type.
*Since the diagonal entries of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are positive, &quot;S&quot; cannot be negative definite or negative semidefinite.

Symmetrizable indecomposable generalized Cartan matrices of finite and affine type have been completely classified. They correspond to Dynkin diagrams and affine Dynkin diagrams. Little is known about the Kac–Moody algebras of indefinite type, although the groups corresponding to these Kac–Moody algebras were constructed over arbitrary fields by Jacques Tits.

Among the Kac–Moody algebras of indefinite type, most work has focused on those hyperbolic type, for which the matrix &quot;S&quot; is indefinite, but for each proper subset of &quot;I&quot;, the corresponding submatrix is positive definite or positive semidefinite. Hyperbolic Kac–Moody algebras have rank at most 10, and they have been completely classified. There are infinitely many of rank 2, and 238 of ranks between 3 and 10.

<text>The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&amp;MEF) was a small volunteer force of approximately 2,000 men, raised in Australia shortly after the outbreak of World War I to seize and destroy German wireless stations in German New Guinea in the south-west Pacific. The German wireless installations were ordered to be destroyed because they were used by &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy, which threatened merchant shipping in the region. Following the capture of German possessions in the region, the AN&amp;MEF provided occupation forces for the duration of the war. New Zealand provided a similar force for the occupation of German Samoa.

==History==
===Formation===

The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&amp;MEF) began forming following a request by the British government on 6 August 1914. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru and at Rabaul, New Britain. The force was assembled under the guidance of Colonel James Legge, and was separate from the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) forming under Major General William Bridges. The AN&amp;MEF comprised one battalion of infantry of 1,000 men enlisted in Sydney, plus 500 naval reservists and ex-sailors who would serve as infantry. The 1st Battalion, AN&amp;MEF was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment, which had been hurriedly dispatched to garrison Thursday Island, also contributed 500 volunteers to the force. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the very few of the infantry having had previous military experience.

Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the AN&amp;MEF departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS &quot;Berrima&quot; and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until the New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser , cruiser , and the French cruiser &quot;Montcalm&quot;, occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN&amp;MEF then moved to Port Moresby where it met the Queensland contingent aboard the transport TSS &quot;Kanowna&quot;. The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September but the &quot;Kanowna&quot; was left behind when her stokers refused to work. The soldiers from the Kennedy Regiment were also left in Port Moresby as Holmes felt that they were not trained or equipped well enough to be committed to the fighting that was expected.

===Landing at Rabaul===

Off the eastern tip of New Guinea, the &quot;Berrima&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Australia&quot; and the light cruiser plus some destroyers. &quot;Melbourne&quot; had been detached to destroy the wireless station on Nauru. The task force reached Rabaul on 11 September, finding the port free of German forces. &quot;Sydney&quot; and the destroyer landed small parties of naval reservists at the settlements of Kabakaul and the German gubernatorial capital Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo) on Neu-Pommern (now New Britain), south-east of Rabaul. These parties were reinforced firstly by sailors from &quot;Warrego&quot; and later by infantry from &quot;Berrima&quot;. A small 25-man force of naval reservists was subsequently landed at Kabakaul Bay and proceeded inland to capture the radio station believed to be in operation at Bita Paka, to the south.

The Australians were resisted by a mixed force of German reservists and Melanesian native police, who forced them to fight their way to the objective. By nightfall the radio station was reached, and it was found to have been abandoned. The mast had been dropped but its instruments and machinery were still intact. During the fighting at Bita Paka seven Australians were killed and five wounded, while the defenders lost one German NCO and about 30 Melanesians killed, and one German and 10 Melanesians wounded. Later it was alleged that the heavy losses among the Melanesian troops was the result of the Australians bayoneting all those they had captured during the fighting. As a result of this engagement Seaman W.G.V. Williams became the first Australian fatality of the war.

At nightfall on 12 September, &quot;Berrima&quot; landed the AN&amp;MEF infantry battalion at Rabaul. The following afternoon, despite the fact that the German governor had not surrendered the territory, a ceremony was carried out to signal the British occupation of New Britain. The German administration had withdrawn inland to Toma and at dawn on 14 September, bombarded a ridge near the town, while half a battalion advanced towards the town, supported by a field gun.

===German surrender===
The show of Australian firepower was sufficient to start negotiations, ending the Siege of Toma. Terms were signed on 17 September and all military resistance ceased, with the remaining 40 German soldiers and 110 natives surrendering on 21 September. The German colony at Madang on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (the New Guinea mainland) was occupied on 24 September but the German auxiliary cruiser SMS &quot;Cormoran&quot;, which was lurking nearby, escaped undetected. Over the next two months the remaining outposts were occupied. The terms of the surrender allowed the colony&#x27;s governor, Dr Eduard Haber, to return to Germany while German civilians were allowed to remain as long as they swore an oath of neutrality. Those who refused were transported to Australia from where they could freely travel back to Germany.

Although successful, the operation was not well managed, and the Australians had been effectively delayed by a half-trained force. Regardless, the Australians had prevailed not least of all because of their unexpected ability to fight close terrain, while the outflanking of the German positions had unnerved their opponents. The losses of the AN&amp;MEF were light in the context of later operations but were sufficiently heavy given the relatively modest gain. These losses were further compounded by the disappearance of the Australian submarine during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September, with 35 men aboard.

===Occupation===
Following the capture of German possessions in the region, the AN&amp;MEF provided occupation forces for the duration of the war. The occupation force included Australian nurses, who also later were part of the &quot;Tropical Force&quot;. A military government was subsequently set up by Holmes. On 9 January 1915, Holmes handed over command of the AN&amp;MEF to Brigadier General Sir Samuel Pethebridge, the former Secretary of the Department of Defence. Holmes returned to Australia in early 1915 and re-enlisted in the AIF, as did most of his men. Many later served in Egypt, Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine and on the Western Front. A large number became casualties, including Holmes, who was killed in action in 1917. They were replaced by the 3rd Battalion, AN&amp;MEF, which was known as the Tropical Force because it had been specially enlisted for service in the tropics. The size of the garrison at this time was set at a total of 600 men.

Following the end of hostilities in November 1918 the role of the AN&amp;MEF in the former German colonies in New Guinea had become primarily one of civil administration, although it continued to provide a garrison for the next two and a half years. The military government continued until 1921 when Australia received a mandate from the League of Nations to govern the territory. Although the AN&amp;MEF had seen no further action following the initial seizure of the colony, in the years that followed the climate and a range of tropical diseases, such as malaria, had resulted in dozens of fatalities before the deployment concluded. A total of 3,011 men served in the AN&amp;MEF. Although interrupted by Japanese occupation between 1942–45, Australian administration lasted until 1975 when Papua New Guinea gained its independence.

<text>Certain commutation relations among the current density operators in quantum field theories define an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra called a current algebra. Mathematically these are Lie algebras consisting of smooth maps from a manifold into a finite dimensional Lie algebra.

==History==
The original current algebra, proposed in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann, described weak and electromagnetic currents of the strongly interacting particles, hadrons, leading to the Adler–Weisberger formula and other important physical results. The basic concept, in the era just preceding quantum chromodynamics, was that even without knowing the Lagrangian governing hadron dynamics in detail, exact kinematical information – the local symmetry – could still be encoded in an algebra of
currents.

The commutators involved in current algebra amount to an infinite-dimensional extension of the Jordan map, where the quantum fields represent infinite arrays of oscillators.

Current algebraic techniques are still part of the shared background of particle physics when analyzing symmetries and indispensable in discussions of the Goldstone theorem.

==Example==
In a non-Abelian Yang–Mills symmetry, where and are flavor-current and axial-current 0th components (charge densities), respectively, the paradigm of a current algebra is
:formula_1 and 
:formula_2
where are the structure constants of the Lie algebra. To get meaningful expressions, these must be normal ordered.

The algebra resolves to a direct sum of two algebras, and , upon defining
:formula_3
whereupon
formula_4

==Conformal field theory==
For the case where space is a one-dimensional circle, current algebras arise naturally as a central extension of the loop algebra, known as Kac–Moody algebras or, more specifically, affine Lie algebras. In this case, the commutator and normal ordering can be given a very precise mathematical definition in terms of integration contours on the complex plane, thus avoiding some of the formal divergence difficulties commonly encountered in quantum field theory.

When the Killing form of the Lie algebra is contracted with the current commutator, one obtains the energy–momentum tensor of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. When this tensor is expanded as a Laurent series, the resulting algebra is called the Virasoro algebra. This calculation is known as the Sugawara construction.

The general case is formalized as the vertex operator algebra.

<doc id="1146295" wikidata="Q237555" url="?curid=1146295" title="Sarah Waters">
<text>Sarah Ann Waters (born 21 July 1966) is a Welsh novelist. She is best known for her novels set in Victorian society and featuring lesbian protagonists, such as &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; and &quot;Fingersmith&quot;.

==Life and education==

===Early life===
Sarah Waters was born in Neyland, Pembrokeshire, Wales, in 1966. She later moved to Middlesbrough, England, when she was eight years old. She grew up in a family that included her father Ron, mother Mary, and a &quot;much older&quot; sister. Her mother was a housewife and her father an engineer who worked on oil refineries. She describes her family as &quot;pretty idyllic, very safe and nurturing&quot;. Her father, &quot;a fantastically creative person&quot;, encouraged her to build and invent.

Waters said, &quot;When I picture myself as a child, I see myself constructing something, out of plasticine or papier-mâché or Meccano; I used to enjoy writing poems and stories, too.&quot; She wrote stories and poems that she describes as &quot;dreadful gothic pastiches&quot;, but had not planned her career. Despite her obvious enjoyment of writing, she did not feel any special calling or preference for becoming a novelist in her youth.

Waters was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, joining as a result of her boyfriend at the time. Politically, she has always identified as a leftist.

===Education===
After Milford Haven Grammar School, Waters attended university and earned degrees in English literature. She received a BA from the University of Kent, an MA from Lancaster University, and a PhD from Queen Mary, University of London. Her PhD thesis, entitled &quot;Wolfskins and togas: lesbian and gay historical fictions, 1870 to the present&quot;, served as inspiration and material for future books. As part of her research she read 19th-century pornography, in which she came across the title of her first book, &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;. However, her literary influences are also found in the popular classics of Victorian literature, such as Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Mary Shelley and the Brontës, and in the contemporary novelists that combine a keen interest in Victoriana with a post-modernist approach to fiction, especially A.S. Byatt and John Fowles. Angela Carter&#x27;s &quot;Nights at the Circus&quot; had a huge influence on her début novel as well; Waters praises Carter for her literary prose, her &quot;common touch&quot;, and her commitment to feminism.

=== Personal life ===
Waters came out as lesbian in the late 1980s. She has been in a relationship with copy editor Lucy Vaughan since 2002. As of 2007, she lived in Kennington, south-east London. 

==Career==
Before writing novels, Waters worked as an academic, earning a doctorate and teaching. Waters went directly from her doctoral thesis to her first novel. It was during the process of writing her thesis that she thought she would write a novel; she began as soon as the thesis was complete. Her work is very research-intensive, which is an aspect she enjoys. Waters was briefly a member of the long-running London North Writers circle, whose members have included the novelists Charles Palliser and Neil Blackmore, among others.

With the exception of &quot;The Little Stranger&quot;, all of her books contain lesbian themes, and she does not mind being labelled a lesbian writer. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m writing with a clear lesbian agenda in the novels. It&#x27;s right there at the heart of the books.&quot; Despite this &quot;common agenda in teasing out lesbian stories from parts of history that are regarded as quite heterosexual&quot;, she also calls her lesbian protagonists &quot;incidental&quot;, due to her own sexual orientation. &quot;That&#x27;s how it is in my life, and that&#x27;s how it is, really, for most lesbian and gay people, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s sort of just there in your life.&quot;

===&quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; (1998)===

Her debut work was the Victorian picaresque &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;, published by Virago Press in 1998. The novel took 18 months to write. The book takes its title from Victorian slang for cunnilingus. Waters describes the novel as a &quot;very upbeat [...] kind of a romp&quot;.

It won a 1999 Betty Trask Award, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; / John Llewellyn Rhys Prize.

In 2002, the novel was adapted into a three-part television serial of the same name for BBC Two. It has been translated into at least 24 languages, including Chinese, Latvian, Hungarian, Korean and Slovenian.

===&quot;Affinity&quot; (1999)===
Waters&#x27;s second book, &quot;Affinity&quot;, was published a year after her first, in 1999. The novel, also set in the Victorian era, centres on the world of Victorian Spiritualism. While finishing her debut novel, Waters had been working on an academic paper on spiritualism. She combined her interests in spiritualism, prisons, and the Victorian era in &quot;Affinity&quot;, which tells the story of the relationship between an upper-middle-class woman and an imprisoned spiritualist.

The novel is less light-hearted than the ones that preceded and followed it. Waters found it less enjoyable to write. &quot;It was a very gloomy world to have to go into every day&quot;, she said.

&quot;Affinity&quot; won the Stonewall Book Award and Somerset Maugham Award. Andrew Davies wrote a screenplay adapting &quot;Affinity&quot; and the resulting feature film premiered 19 June 2008 at the opening night of Frameline the San Francisco LGBT Film Festival at the Castro Theater.

===&quot;Fingersmith&quot; (2002)===

&quot;Fingersmith&quot; was published in 2002. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and the Orange Prize.

&quot;Fingersmith&quot; was made into a serial for BBC One in 2005, starring Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy and Imelda Staunton. Waters approved of the adaptation, calling it &quot;a really good quality show&quot;, and said it was &quot;very faithful to the book. It was spookily faithful to the book at times, which was exciting.&quot; The novel was later adapted again by South Korean director Park Chan-wook into the 2016 film &quot;The Handmaiden&quot;, which set the story in Japanese-occupied Korea in the 1930s.

&quot;Fingersmith&quot; was named by singer and artist David Bowie as one of his &quot;top 100 books&quot;.

===&quot;The Night Watch&quot; (2006)===

&quot;The Night Watch&quot; took four years for Waters to write. It differs from the first three novels in its time period and its structure. Although her thesis and previous books focused on the 19th century, Waters said that &quot;Something about the 1940s called to me&quot;. It was also less tightly plotted than her other books. Waters said,

The novel tells the stories of a man and three women in 1940s London. Waters describes it as &quot;fundamentally a novel about disappointment and loss and betrayal&quot;, as well as &quot;real contact between people and genuine intimacy&quot;.

In 2005, Waters received the highest bid (£1,000) during a charity auction in which the prize was the opportunity to have the winner&#x27;s name immortalised in &quot;The Night Watch&quot;. The auction featured many notable British novelists, and the name of the bidder, author Martina Cole, appeared in Waters&#x27; novel.

&quot;The Night Watch&quot; was adapted for television by BBC2 and broadcast on 12 July 2011.

=== &quot;The Little Stranger&quot; (2009) ===

Also set in the 1940s, &quot;The Little Stranger&quot; also differs from Waters&#x27; previous novels. It is her first with no overtly lesbian characters. Initially, Waters set out to write a book about the economic changes brought by socialism in postwar Britain, and reviewers note the connection with Evelyn Waugh. During the novel&#x27;s construction, it turned into a ghost story, focusing on a family of gentry who own a large country house they can no longer afford to maintain.

===&quot;The Paying Guests&quot; (2014)===

This novel is set in the 1920s, in the social and economic aftermath of World War I. Households are in reduced circumstances and Frances Wray and her mother have to take in lodgers to keep going. The developing lesbian relationship between Frances and lodger Lilian Barber provides a complex backdrop for a murder investigation that takes up the latter half of the book. &quot;The Observer&quot; said: &quot;The inimitable Sarah Waters handles a dramatic key change with aplomb in her new novel set in 1920s south London&quot;. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;eerie, virtuoso writing&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
Waters was named as one of &quot;Granta&quot;″s 20 &quot;Best of Young British Writers&quot; in January 2003. The same year, she received the South Bank Award for Literature. She was named Author of the Year at the 2003 British Book Awards. In both 2006 and 2009 she won &quot;Writer of the Year&quot; at the annual Stonewall Awards. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2009. She holds an honorary degree from Lancaster University. She has featured on the Pinc List of leading Welsh LGBT figures.

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to literature.

Each of her novels has received awards as well.

<text>With a height of , Maderas is the smaller of the two volcanoes which make up the island of Ometepe. The volcano, and the island upon which it sits, is situated in Lake Nicaragua in Nicaragua, Central America. Unlike Concepción, the other volcano on the island, Maderas has not been active in historical times. Its crater contains a crater lake.

The slopes of Maderas are one of the few places on the Pacific side of Nicaragua where cloud forests grow. The only other place where this ecosystem can be found is the Mombacho volcano. Cloud forests are characterized by a rich plant and animal life, made possible by the high levels of humidity in the climate. Prehistoric petroglyphs have been found at the Maderas volcano.

Climbing to the top of the volcano is a popular tourist activity. Tourists are strongly encouraged by local guiding companies to hire a guide, but the trail from the common starting point at Finca Magdalena is easy to see the entire way to the top. The hike to the top of the crater can be difficult, with steep inclines that become muddy during rainy weather. It rains often on Ometepe Island, so a slippery climb is likely, even in the dry season. The round-trip hike takes between 6 and 9 hours and changes from dry forest to humid forest to cloud forest.

There are a number of animal species that dwell on the volcano, including the white-faced monkey, mountain crab, howler monkeys, and a number of butterflies including the blue morphos.

<doc id="1146304" wikidata="Q204435" url="?curid=1146304" title="Cesspit">
<text>Cesspit, cesspool and soak pit in some contexts are terms with various meanings: they are used to describe either an underground holding tank (sealed at the bottom) or a soak pit (not sealed at the bottom). A cesspit can be used for the temporary collection and storage of feces, excreta, or fecal sludge as part of an on-site sanitation system and has some similarities with septic tanks or with soak pits. Traditionally, it was a deep cylindrical chamber dug into the ground, having approximate dimensions of 1 metre (3&#x27;) diameter and 2–3 metres (6&#x27; to 10&#x27;) depth. Its appearance was similar to that of a hand-dug water well.

The pit can be lined with bricks or concrete, covered with a slab, and needs to be emptied frequently when in use as an underground holding tank. In other cases (if soil and groundwater conditions allow), it is not constructed watertight, to allow liquid to leach out (similar to a pit latrine or to a soak pit).

== Terminology ==
In British English, historiccaly, a cesspit was just a hole dug into the ground, often lined with bricks or stones with gaps between them to collect household sewage and wastewater. The gaps in the lining allowed liquid waste to seep into the surrounding soil, while solid waste accumulated at the bottom of the pit.

A cesspool (in Brittish English) is watertight tank (usually made from plastic or concrete) that is located underground to store sewage and wastewater until it can be removed by a specialist contractor.

== Uses ==
=== Holding tank ===
In the UK, a cesspit is a closed tank for the reception and temporary storage of sewage; in North America, this is simply referred to as a &quot;holding tank&quot;. Because it is sealed, the tank must be emptied frequently – on average every 6 weeks – but frequency varies a great deal and can be as often as weekly or as rarely as quarterly. Because of the need for frequent emptying, the cost of maintenance of a cesspit can be high. If owners in the UK do not maintain their cesspits, they can be fined up to £20,000.

=== Infiltration systems ===

A cesspool was at one time built like a dry well lined with loose-fitting brick or stone, used for the disposal of sewage via infiltration into the soil. Liquids leaked out through the soil as conditions allowed, while solids decayed and collected as composted matter in the base of the cesspool. As the solids accumulated, eventually the particulate solids blocked the escape of liquids, causing the cesspool to drain more slowly or to overflow.

A biofilm forms in the loose soil surrounding a cesspool or pit latrine that provides some degree of attenuation of the pollutants present, but a deep cesspool can allow raw sewage to directly enter groundwater with minimal biological cleansing, leading to groundwater pollution and undrinkable water supplies. It is for this reason that deep water wells on the property must be drilled far from the cesspool.

Most residential waste cesspools in use in the US today are rudimentary septic systems, consisting of a concrete-capped pit lined with concrete masonry units (cinder blocks) laid on their sides with perforated drain field piping (weeping tile) extending outward below the level of the intake connection. The concrete cover often has a cleanout pipe extending above ground. Some are constructed with concrete walls on one or more sides.

The waste cesspool is vulnerable to overloading or flooding by heavy rains or snow melt because it is not enclosed and sealed like conventional septic tank systems. It is also vulnerable to the entry of tree roots, which can eventually cause the system to fail.

== Regulations ==

Modern environmental regulations either discourage or ban the use of cesspools, and instead connections to municipal sewage systems or septic tanks are encouraged or required.

In many countries, planning and development regulations for the protection of the watershed prevent home-owners who live close to rivers and environmentally sensitive areas from installing a septic system, requiring a holding tank instead.

=== United States ===
In some localities in the U.S., existing rural residential waste cesspools are &quot;grandfathered&quot;, i.e. allowed to continue operations until they no longer function. Once defunct, they must be disconnected and replaced by modern septic systems. In areas that have a higher than usual water table or fail a percolation test, an above-ground drain field waste disposal system may be installed instead.

In the case of sale or transfer of residential property that uses an existing waste cesspool system, local laws may differ. Some counties or jurisdictions do not permit the sale of residential property that utilizes a waste cesspool. Other counties or villages may recognize the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; and allow the property sale or transfer with the cesspool.

== History ==
=== United States ===
The typical American urbanite in the 1870s relied on the rural solution of individual well and outhouse (privy) or cesspools. Baltimore in the 1880s smelled &quot;like a billion polecats&quot; according to H. L. Mencken, and a Chicagoan said in his city &quot;the stink is enough to knock you down.&quot; Improvement was slow, and large cities of the East and South depended to the end of the century mainly on drainage through open gutters. Pollution of water supplies by sewage as well as dumping of industrial waste accounted in large measures for the public health records and high mortality rates of the period. 

=== Europe ===
Cesspits were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, at a time when urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of waste volume began overloading urban street gutters, where chamber pots were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen known in the UK as gongfermors using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s.

Before construction reforms were introduced in the early 19th century, liquid waste would seep away through the ground, leaving solid waste behind in the cesspit. While this made removal of solid waste easier, the seeping liquid waste often contaminated well water sources, creating public health problems. Municipal reforms required that cesspits be built of solid walls of stone and concrete. This kept liquid waste in the cesspit, forcing cesspits to be cleaned more frequently, on average two or three times per year. Liquid cesspit waste would be removed with pumps by cesspit cleaners, and then solid waste, valuable as fertilizer and for manufacturing ammonia, was removed.

In 1846, French public hygienist Alphone Guérard estimated that 100 cesspits were cleaned in Paris every night, by 200–250 total cesspit cleaners in the city, and out of a total of 30,000 cesspits. The replacement of Paris&#x27; cesspit system was challenged for decades by officials not on public hygiene grounds, but on economic ones, based on the desire to conserve human waste as fertilizer rather than disposing of it in a modern sewer system. Paris&#x27; sewer system began modernizing in the 1880s, with the conversion of storm sewers for public sewage. Some cesspits were still in use in Paris into the 20th century.

== Society and culture ==

=== Accidents ===
In Suffolk County, New York, most households still use cesspools for waste drainage. Cesspool collapses have occurred in the area, for example on December 8, 2009, when two workers in a decommissioned cesspit were trapped, requiring a two-hour rescue mission. Since 1998, six cases have been reported of cesspools collapsing and sucking in human residents standing over them, injuring a total of seven people, and killing one in 2001, one in 2007, and one in 2010.

On June 1, 2011, two teenagers, from the Suffolk County neighborhood of Farmingville, drowned after becoming overwhelmed by fumes and trapped in a backyard cesspool measuring deep. Collapsing cesspools are mostly older ones, built with brick or cinder block. Those structures weakened over their lifespan leading to increased risk of collapse. Newer cesspools are made from precast concrete, which dramatically decreases the risk of collapse. All new construction in areas without sewerage systems use the new precast cesspools. In addition, cast concrete cesspools are used commonly in commercial construction, for storm water collection.

=== Archaeology ===
Archaeologists often use the term cesspit (or cess pit) to refer to a pit dug to receive human waste. The word &quot;cess&quot; is sometimes used by archaeologists to refer to the contents found in cesspits, despite this not being etymologically correct.

<doc id="1146308" wikidata="Q613424" url="?curid=1146308" title="Masaya Volcano">
<text>Masaya () is a caldera located in Masaya, Nicaragua, south of the capital Managua. It is Nicaragua&#x27;s first and largest national park, and one of 78 protected areas of Nicaragua. The complex volcano is composed of a nested set of calderas and craters, the largest of which is Las Sierras shield volcano and caldera. Within this caldera lies a sub-vent, which is Masaya Volcano &quot;&quot;. The vent is a shield type composed of basaltic lavas and tephras and includes a summit crater. This hosts Masaya caldera, formed 2,500 years ago by an basaltic ignimbrite eruption. Inside this caldera a new basaltic complex has grown from eruptions mainly on a semi-circular set of vents that include the Masaya and Nindiri cones. The latter host the pit craters of Masaya, Santiago, Nindiri and San Pedro. Observations in the walls of the pit craters indicate that there have been several episodes of cone and pit crater formation.

Masaya continually emits large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas (from the active Santiago crater) and volcanologists study this (amongst other signs) to better understand the behavior of the volcano and also evaluate the impact of acid rain and the potential for health problems.

==History==

The floor of Masaya caldera is mainly covered by poorly vegetated ʻaʻā lava, indicating resurfacing within the past 1,000 or so years, but only two lava flows have erupted since the sixteenth century. The first, in 1670, was an overflow from the Nindiri crater, which at that time hosted a 1-km-wide lava lake. The other, in 1772, issued from a fissure on the flank of the Masaya cone. Since 1772, lava has appeared at the surface only in the Santiago pit crater (presently active and persistently degassing) and possibly within Nindiri crater in 1852. A lake occupies the far eastern end of the caldera.

Although the recent activity of Masaya has largely been dominated by continuous degassing from an occasionally lava-filled pit crater, a number of discrete explosive events have occurred in the last 50 years. One such event occurred on November 22, 1999, which was recognised from satellite data. A hot spot appeared on satellite imagery, and there was a possible explosion. On April 23, 2001, the crater exploded and formed a new vent in the bottom of the crater. The explosion sent rocks with diameters up to which travelled up to from the crater. Vehicles in the visitors area were damaged and one person was injured. On October 4, 2003, an eruption cloud was reported at Masaya. The plume rose to a height of about . In 2008, the mountain erupted spewing ash and steam. This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project. Volcanic gas emissions from this volcano are measured by a Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System, which detects pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.

On March 4, 2020, tightrope daredevil Nik Wallenda walked on a steel cable over the caldera.

==National park==
In 1979, Masaya became Nicaragua&#x27;s first national park, named Masaya Volcano National Park (Parque Nacional Volcán Masaya). The park has an area of and includes two volcanoes and five craters, as well as a range of elevations between 100 and 630 meters above sea level. In the park is a lava tube formed by lava flows; one can find bats and look inside and observe the glowing lava in the dark crater mouth of the volcano.

==Geologic setting==


Masaya is one of 18 distinct volcanic centers that make up the Nicaraguan portion of the Central American Volcanic Belt (CAVF). Formed by the subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate, along the Mesoamerican trench, the CAVF runs from volcán Tacaná in Guatemala to Irazú in Costa Rica. In western Nicaragua, the CAVF bisects the Nicaraguan Depression from Cosigüina volcano in the northwest to Maderas volcano in Lago Nicaragua. The Interior highlands to the northeast make up the majority of Nicaragua. Western Nicaragua consists of four principal geological provinces paralleling the Mesoamerican trench: 1. Pre-Cretaceous to Cretaceous ophiolitic suite; 2. Tertiary basins; 3. Tertiary volcanics; and the 4. Active Quaternary volcanic range.

An ophiolitic suite is found in the Nicoya Complex, which is made up of cherts, graywackes, tholeiitic pillow lavas and basaltic agglomerates. It is intruded by gabbroic, diabasic, and dioritic rocks. The Cretaceous–Tertiary basin is made up of five formations of mainly marine origin. The Rivas and Brito formations are uplifted to the southeast and are overlain in the northwest by a slightly tilted marine near-shore sequence, the El Fraile formation. This in turn passes north into the undeformed Tamarindo formation, a sequence of shallow marine, lacustrine and terrestrial sediments interspersed with ignimbrites. Northeast of the Nicaraguan Depression, the Coyol and Matagalpa formations, run from Honduras to Costa Rica and still show evidence of some volcanic centres, distinguishable as constructional landforms.

Quaternary volcanic rocks are found mainly in the Nicaraguan Depression and form two major groups: the Marrabios and the Sierras formations. The Marrabios Cordillera starts in the northwest with Cosiguina volcano and continues to the southeast with San Cristobal, Casitas, La Pelona, Telica and Rota. The Hoyo, Monte Galan, Momotombo and Momotombito volcanoes are built upon ignimbrite deposits from the nearby Malpaisillo caldera. South-east of Lake Managua lie Chiltepe, the Nejapa alignment, Masaya, Apoyo and Mombacho which overlie the Sierras ignimbrites, erupted from the Sierras Caldera surrounding Masaya volcano. Further south in Lake Cocibolca (or Lake Nicaragua), Zapatera, Concepcion and Maderas volcanoes mark the end of Nicaraguan section of the CAVF.

<text>Mombacho is a stratovolcano in Nicaragua, near the city of Granada. It is high. The Mombacho Volcano Nature Reserve is one of 78 protected areas of Nicaragua. Mombacho’s last eruption occurred in 1570. There is no historical knowledge of earlier eruptions.

The highest regions of the volcano are home to a cloud forest and dwarf forest, which contain flora and fauna endemic purely to the volcano. An increasingly popular tourist attraction, the volcano has views of Lake Nicaragua and the city of Granada. The volcano also has two hiking trails, a moderate one that circles the main crater, and another, more difficult trail (El Puma), which must be led by a guide. The more difficult trail is the only way to see some features such as the dwarf forest. The trail is almost completely 45° inclines and declines for about two miles.

More than 700 different plants are registered around Mombacho, including many species of orchids.

<text>Darren Arthur Daulton (January 3, 1962 – August 6, 2017), nicknamed &quot;Dutch&quot;, was an American professional baseball catcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies (, –) and Florida Marlins (1997). While with the Phillies, Daulton was a three-time MLB All-Star and won the Silver Slugger Award. He won the 1997 World Series with the Marlins.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Phillies===

The Philadelphia Phillies selected Daulton in the 25th round of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft. On September 25, 1983, he made his major league debut for the Phillies. Daulton had three at bats for the Phillies in 1983. Through , he played sparingly, due chiefly to the presence of all-star catchers Ozzie Virgil Jr. and Lance Parrish. Daulton became the Phillies&#x27; full-time catcher in . Throughout his early career, his primary value to the team was as a defensive catcher — his cumulative batting average of .206, through the 1988 season, was barely above the Mendoza Line — and he never appeared in as many as 60 games, in any single season. Daulton&#x27;s breakout season was , his first as his team&#x27;s primary backstop; that year, he batted .268, with 57 runs batted in (RBI) — which, when coupled with his skills behind the plate, earned him a three-year contract worth $6.75 million. Daulton caught Terry Mulholland&#x27;s no-hitter, on August 15, 1990.

Following a slump in that saw his batting average fall below .200, Daulton led the National League (NL) in RBIs for 1992 with 109. He also finished in the top 10 in on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS, home runs, walks, runs created, and extra base hits. Daulton earned his first All-star appearance, the NL Silver Slugger Award, and sixth place in NL MVP voting.

Daulton was one of the catalysts of the NL pennant-winning 1993 Phillies. Although the Phillies lost the World Series, Daulton was again named an All-Star, drove in more than 100 runs for the second consecutive season, and finished seventh in NL MVP voting. He once again finished in the league&#x27;s top 10 in on-base percentage, RBIs, walks, and extra base hits. Daulton also finished in the top 10 in times on base and intentional walks.

Knee injuries soon caught up with Daulton. In , he was hitting .300, with 15 home runs, and 56 RBIs, through 67 games, when he was injured. In , Daulton was named to his third all-star team; however, he played in only 98 games, and finished the year with just nine home runs. Daulton never caught another big league game after August 25, 1995.

Daulton missed nearly the entire season due to injury; he played in only five games, all as an outfielder. In , he returned to the outfield in an attempt to keep his still-productive bat in the line-up, despite his chronic injuries. Daulton also played 42 games as a first baseman.

===Florida Marlins===
On July 21, 1997, after 17 years with the Phillies organization, the club traded Daulton to the Florida Marlins for Billy McMillon. By that time, Daulton&#x27;s knee injuries had escalated even further, limiting his usage to playing first base and pinch hitting. He ended the 1997 campaign with a .263 batting average, 14 home runs, 63 RBI, and 68 runs scored, in 395 at bats. Daulton batted 7-for-18 (.389) in the 1997 World Series, as the Marlins defeated the Cleveland Indians. Daulton announced his retirement after the series.

===Career statistics===
In 14 MLB seasons, Daulton hit .245, with 137 home runs, 588 RBIs, and 511 runs scored, in 1,161 games played. Bill James ranked Daulton as the 25th-greatest major league catcher of all time, in the 2001 edition of his &quot;Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;.

On August 6, 2010, Daulton was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame.

==Post-playing career==
===Arrests===
Daulton was arrested several times on vehicle-related charges. He was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in Pinellas County, Florida, in 1988, and his driver&#x27;s license was suspended for a year after he refused to take a breathalyzer test. His license was again suspended in the late 1990s due to unpaid speeding tickets; he received at least five speeding tickets during that time period, including one for driving in excess of in a zone.

While under his second license suspension, he was involved in a single-vehicle accident on January 3, 2001, causing $20,000 worth of damage to his BMW sedan. He again refused to be tested, and was again charged with DUI and also with driving with a suspended license and failing to appear in court.

Two years later, Daulton was arrested a third time for driving with a suspended license and DUI, after again refusing to be tested for alcohol.

He was arrested a fourth time for battery against his wife. He served two and a half months in jail and spent another two and a half months in drug rehabilitation.

===Daulton Foundation===
In the years following his arrests and jail time, Daulton began to turn his life around, acknowledging his shortcomings and doing work within the local community and charity. In 2013, Daulton founded The Darren Daulton Foundation with his wife Amanda. The foundation, which went on to issue grants to over 100 people totaling over $250,000, provided financial assistance to those who suffer from primary brain tumors. The foundation is still active to this day.

===Author===
Daulton authored a book on occultism and numerology, &quot;If They Only Knew&quot;, published in 2007. In the book, he writes about numerous aspects of occultism, referencing experts in the field, and addressing his own personal experience with the paranormal.

===Radio show===
From 2010 to 2016, during the Philadelphia Phillies season, Daulton hosted the radio show &quot;Talking Baseball with Dutch&quot; from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. on sports radio station WPEN in Philadelphia.

==Illness and death==
On July 1, 2013, Daulton underwent surgery for resection of two brain tumors related to glioblastoma at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. On February 23, 2015, Daulton announced that he was cancer-free. The cancer returned in early 2017, and Daulton died from brain cancer on August 6, 2017, aged 55. He is buried in Memorial Lawn Cemetery in Arkansas City.

<text>Momotombo is a stratovolcano in Nicaragua, located near the city of León. It stands on the shores of Lake Managua. An eruption of the volcano in 1610 forced inhabitants of León, in the Spanish Empire, to relocate about west. The ruins of the city are preserved at León Viejo. It also erupted in 1886, 1905 and most recently on 30 November 2015 and 28 February 2016.
The mountain is very symmetrical, and its form is a symbol of Nicaragua, cropping up in locations from matchboxes to revolutionary murals. This volcano was also very popular before World War I began. Many tourists visited, especially in 1904, one year before the eruption. The Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío wrote the poem &quot;Momotombo&quot; in its honour.

A major geothermal field is located on the southern flank of the volcano. To climb the mountain, with a permit, cross through the geothermal powerplant and follow an easily marked trail through the treeline. Due to the active nature of the volcano, as well as the threat of landslides, the route from the treeline to the top is constantly changing. The quickest way is straight up, through the small avalanche paths.

It has a younger cone: , which is inside of Lake Managua.

<text>Guernsey Airport is an international airport on the island of Guernsey and the largest airport in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. It is located in the Forest, a parish in Guernsey, southwest of St. Peter Port and features mostly flights to Great Britain and some other European destinations.

==History==
The airport was officially opened on 5 May 1939. However, regular air services only commenced in October 1946. By 1948, BEA were operating a daily service to Southampton using Douglas DC-3 aircraft. From 1951, Jersey Airlines flew BEA associate scheduled services to Southampton at weekends using Rapide eight-seat biplane airliners.

In 1960 there were four grass runways, with lengths ranging from to . 1960 also saw the construction of a new tarmac runway of . In early 2000s alongside the work on the new terminal, the States of Guernsey Commerce and Employment department claimed an extension was necessary to allow the use of larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737 Classic or Airbus A320 family for trans-European flights. In 2012, a set of four two-day closures under the Airport 2040 programme allowed contractors for the States of Guernsey to resurface the existing runway, extend runway end safety areas and also reconstruct parts of the concrete apron areas. Taxiways which connect the aprons to the runway were also resurfaced and realigned, whilst a new drainage system was implemented. New airfield ground lighting and navigational aids were also installed.

Aurigny has its head office on the airport property. At one time the Channel Islands subsidiary of British United Airways had its head office on the airport property.

==Facilities==

===Terminal===
Work started on a new terminal building in 2002, which became operational on 19 April 2004. The old terminal was demolished in May 2004 to make space for additional aircraft stands and a passenger walkway from the new terminal. The new terminal was designed to be able to handle about 1.25 million passengers per year. In 2013, 886,396 passengers used the airport, with 49,403 aircraft movements.

Ground handling is provided by &quot;Aurigny Aviation Services&quot; for Aurigny, Blue Islands and British Airways. While &quot;ASG (Aircraft Servicing Guernsey)&quot; and &quot;Aiglle&quot; handle business and general aviation.

===Runway===
There is a single runway, designated 09/27. Runway 09 is the eastbound take-off runway and runway 27 the westbound. The landing distance available LDA in both directions 09/27 is 1463m. The take-off runway available TORA on runway 09 is 1463m. However, on runway 27 only, the take-off runway available TORA is 1583m.

During the first decade of this century, two airlines competed on the most heavily used route from Guernsey, that to London Gatwick. During this period, Aurigny operated ATR 72 turboprop aircraft (72 seats) and Flybe operated BAe 146 jet aircraft (70 to 128 passengers depending on variant). When in 2008 Flybe disposed of their BAe 146 fleet, they initially replaced them with Embraer E195 jet aircraft which could not at that time operate into Guernsey because of the then-low strength of the runway. They therefore elected to operate the smaller Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft. Business leaders and deputies (elected members of the island parliament, the States of Guernsey) argued for and against an extension of the runway from its current length of 1463 m (4,800 ft). Following several years of debate it was announced on 2 October 2009 that Guernsey&#x27;s airport runway and apron would be extensively rebuilt at a then-estimated cost of £81 million. Although Guernsey is largely autonomous, it has to obey the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority regulations. The CAA insisted that extended runway end safety areas (RESAs) be introduced and that the then-existing hump in the runway be removed. The physical runway length was therefore to be increased by 120m at the western end. However, this extension is designated as an RESA. The significance of having only a 1463m runway is that even relatively small commercial jet aircraft in the Airbus A320 family or Boeing 737 Classic families cannot operate from Guernsey at maximum take-off weight; more recent and larger Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft cannot effectively operate from Guernsey at all.

Sufficient progress on the rebuilding works had taken place to enable Flybe to introduce an Embraer E175 jet (88 seats) on their then-existing Gatwick service from 31 March 2013. However, Flybe then decided to dispose of their landing slots at London Gatwick and these were sold to EasyJet. EasyJet made a decision not to operate their Airbus A319 aircraft into Guernsey, leaving a reduction of four rotations per day between Guernsey and Gatwick.

The runway and apron rebuilding operations were completed during 2014. The States-owned Aurigny ordered an Embraer E195 which entered service during 2014; this 122-seat aircraft operates four rotations each day between Guernsey and Gatwick and these are supplemented by up to two ATR 72 rotations. By this means, the loss of passenger capacity between Guernsey and Gatwick occasioned by the Flybe withdrawal has been much reduced.

A growing number of proponents continue to argue that the runway should be extended to 1700m to permit more profitable operation of the Airbus A320 family or Boeing 737 Classic family aircraft, as in the neighboring island of Jersey. This would provide a wider range of flights in and out of the island increasing the island&#x27;s economy and number of visitors each year.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate at regular, scheduled and charter services to and from Guernsey:

==General aviation==
The airport currently runs two liaison groups: one for commercial airport users and one for airport neighbours. A large number of single- and twin-engined light and business aircraft are based at the airport. These, and numerous visiting general aviation aircraft, are serviced by aviation engineering firms located in several hangars located at the southwest and southeast portions of the airport.

==Statistics==

==Ground transport==
===Road===
A long and short-stay car park and overflow car park are located at the airport. Parking areas for bicycles and motorcycles are also available.

Hire cars are available at the airport.

===Public Transport===
A taxi rank is located outside arrivals. 

A bus service is available from operator Buses.gg, with routes 91, 92, 93, 94, and 95, and evening S3 and late-night N3 services.

==Environment==
In 2002, an overturned firetruck discharged PFOS fire retardant onto the airport apron and surrounding soil. PFOS was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009 and has been shown to cause chronic kidney disease amongst people and animals exposed to larger quantities. Traces of spilt PFOS later entered the island&#x27;s water supply although quantities were not high enough to make it unsafe to drink. Because the airport is at the highest point in the island the accident highlighted the vulnerability of the water supply to airport effluence and other water pollutants. Aerodrome works have subsequently involved environmental engineering projects to better contain and divert contaminated effluence away from the water supply. As part of the Airport 2040 development, a new drainage system is being installed and this will allow airport effluence to be contained in a manner which does not affect water supplies in the future.

 PFOS-contaminated soil was contained in a bund on the airport premises. Both this soil and soil polluted when containing fire from a F-27 G-CHNL crash was going to be moved in the future. The soil was removed in 2015. A legal claim of £27m against 3M over PFOS in the High Court failed in 2016 when ruled out of time.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 7 December 1997 an F-27 (registration: G-BNCY) operated by AirUK arriving from Southampton overshot the runway while landing in high cross-winds. The Fokker aircraft aquaplaned on standing water, left the runway end and slid on the wet grass. The aircraft nosed into the cross wind, ending up some off the centre line in a field to the south of the runway. There were no fatalities among the 50 passengers and 4 crew members, although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and subsequently written off.
* On 12 January 1999 another F-27 (registration: G-CHNL) operating a cargo flight for Channel Express arriving from Luton crashed short of runway 27 after deploying full flap on approach. As the flap deployed, the cargo moved aft and this broke the aeroplane&#x27;s mass and balance limits. The flight crew initiated a go-around, which exacerbated the problem by raising the gear and applying power. The aeroplane pitched up uncontrollably and stalled, which resulted in it impacting the conservatory of a house under the flight path. No one on the ground was injured; however, both flight crew were killed by the resulting fire which engulfed the aircraft. The investigation concluded the aeroplane was not loaded in accordance with the loadsheet.
* On 23 April 2024 a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 (registration: 9H-LWB) on wet-lease to Aurigny from Luxwing arriving from London Gatwick overshot runway 27 when landing. None of the 63 passengers and 4 crew were injured, disembarking the aircraft on the grass and being transported back to the terminal via bus; the aircraft itself was seemingly undamaged. The aerodrome was closed for two hours while crews attended to the aircraft, before being reopened for the later services, which had been delayed, to arrive. An investigation into the cause of the incident is being conducted. 

* On 23 May 2024 a Dornier 228 NG (registration: G-ETAC) operated by Aurigny from Alderney arriving into Guernsey suffered a hydraulic failure shortly after landing. This resulted in the aerodrome closing for roughly 40 minutes. None of the 17 passengers or crew were injured.

<doc id="1146335" wikidata="Q952839" url="?curid=1146335" title="Cung Le">
<text>Cung Le (; born May 25, 1972) is an American actor, former professional mixed martial artist, Sanshou fighter and kickboxer. Le is perhaps best known in mixed martial arts for competing in Strikeforce, holding a record of 7–1 with the organization before its demise. He defeated Frank Shamrock to become the second Strikeforce Middleweight Champion before vacating the title to further pursue his acting career. He competed as a middleweight in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), holding a record of 2–2 with the organization. In kickboxing and sanshou, he is a former International Kickboxing Federation Light Heavyweight World Champion, having a professional kickboxing record of 17–0 before moving to mixed martial arts.

As an actor, Le has appeared in films such as &quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Pandorum&quot;, &quot;Fighting&quot;, &quot;Bodyguards and Assassins&quot; (all in 2009), &quot;The Man with the Iron Fists&quot; (2012), &quot;Puncture Wounds&quot; (2014), and &quot;Savage Dog&quot; (2017). He had a lead role in the martial arts film &quot;Dragon Eyes&quot; (2012), co-starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and produced by Joel Silver.

==Background==
Cung Lê was born in Saigon, South Vietnam (now Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam). In 1975, three days before the Fall of Saigon, Cung Le and his mother Anne left Vietnam by helicopter. Le&#x27;s father stayed in Vietnam and was caught as a prisoner. After a few months in a refugee camp in the Philippines, Le ended up in San Jose, California, where early discrimination and bullying inspired him to learn martial arts. His mother enrolled him in Tae Kwon Do classes at the age of 10.

Le began Wrestling competitively at age 14. After being inspired to box by Sylvester Stallone´s &quot;Rocky&quot;, Le graduated and earned All-American honors in Wrestling his junior year at San Jose High School. He went on to wrestle for West Valley College in Saratoga, California, and won the California Junior College State Championship in the 158 lb weight class in 1990 also earning junior college All-American honors. Le also is practiced in a variety of martial arts such as Vovinam, Judo, Karate, Muay Thai, Boxing, Kuntao, Sambo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Sanda - which became his main focus. . Le held a professional Kickboxing record of 17–0 and is a three-time world champion in Kickboxing.

==Sanshou and kickboxing career==
Le has won three US Open International Martial Arts Championships (1994, 1995, 1996). In 1998 he won the Shidokan tournament championship. He has also won four US National Championships (Orlando, FL, 1994, Dallas, TX, 1995, Baltimore, MD, 1997). He earned three bronze medals in his amateur Sanshou world competition compiling an overall amateur record of 18–3. He has been a three-time captain of the United States teams that competed and was the U.S. team captain at the World Wushu Championships in 1997 (Italy) and 1999 (Hong Kong). On December 15, 2001, he defeated Shonie Carter by unanimous decision in San Jose, California, to win the IKF International Kickboxing Federation Pro Light Heavyweight Sanda World Title. In May 2003, Le entered into K-1 competitions where he garnered a 3–0 career record, including one knockout.

==Mixed martial arts career==

===Strikeforce===
Le made his mixed martial arts debut at &quot;&quot; on March 10, 2006, at the HP Pavilion at San Jose, knocking out kickboxing rival Mike Altman at 3:51 of the first round. Le first met Altman in San Jose, in 1999, in a kickboxing bout where he defeated Altman via a body shot in the third round. Three months later he faced KOTC veteran Brian Warren, knocking him out at 4:19 of the first round. Le had also faced Warren in a K-1 Sanshou bout where he won by decision. At &quot;&quot; on December 8, 2006, Le defeated UFC veteran Jason Von Flue in 0:43 of round one, when the fight had to be stopped due to a cut from a kick. Le went on to fight Tony Fryklund. Le beat Fryklund via TKO due to strikes late in the third round. Soon after, Le fought Sammy Morgan at &quot;&quot; where he won the bout via TKO.

On March 29, 2008, at &quot;&quot;, Le defeated long time MMA veteran Frank Shamrock in a fight co-promoted by Strikeforce and EliteXC at the HP Pavilion in San Jose. Le won via TKO when Shamrock&#x27;s right arm (ulna) was broken after a series of kicks, making him the new Strikeforce Middleweight Champion. On September 17, 2009, Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker announced that Le had relinquished his belt after securing a major motion picture deal.

Twenty-one months after his last fight, Le returned to Strikeforce to face Scott Smith at &quot;&quot; on December 19, 2009. Le suffered his first MMA defeat there, losing via TKO at 3:25 of the third round. After the match, Le expressed interest in an immediate rematch with Smith. His wish was granted on June 26, &quot;&quot;, in which Le defeated Smith via TKO in the second round to avenge his only MMA loss at the time.

===Ultimate Fighting Championship===
Le has said that it is basically the UFC or bust for him at this point in his fighting career. &quot;I know for a fact that if I do fight again, it&#x27;s going to be in the UFC. I&#x27;ve never fought in the UFC, but I would love to fight in the UFC. But right now because of my contract with Showtime and Strikeforce, hopefully things can work out because there is a show in San Jose that Cain Velasquez is the main event. I would love to fight in San Jose for the UFC ...&quot; In an interview with BloodyElbow on October 27, 2011, Le revealed he originally signed a six-fight contract with the UFC.

Le was briefly linked to a matchup with Vitor Belfort on November 19, 2011, at &quot;UFC 139&quot;. However, Belfort was removed from the bout and replaced by former Pride FC Middleweight Champion Wanderlei Silva. Le managed to confuse Silva with his unorthodox kicks, and landed a spinning backfist that dropped Silva. During the second round, Silva managed to shake Le with huge punches and knees that completely broke Le&#x27;s nose. Le was stunned, bloodied and fell to the ground, and the fight was stopped by the referee. Afterwards, in the press conference, Dana White commented that it was a good stoppage and that Cung was taken to the hospital.

Le was scheduled to face former UFC Middleweight Champion Rich Franklin on July 7, 2012, at &quot;UFC 148&quot;. However, due to an injury to headliner Vitor Belfort, Franklin instead faced Wanderlei Silva in a 190 lb catchweight rematch on June 23, 2012, at &quot;UFC 147&quot;. Le instead faced former title contender Patrick Côté. He earned his first UFC win via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27).

Le faced Rich Franklin in the main event on November 10, 2012, at &quot;UFC: Macao&quot;. Cung Le won the fight via KO with a powerful hook punch to Franklin&#x27;s head at 2:17 of the first round.

====&quot;The Ultimate Fighter: China&quot;====
In November 2013, it was announced that Le would serve as the chief coach and mentor on &quot;The Ultimate Fighter: China&quot;, the China-based version of &quot;The Ultimate Fighter&quot; which began airing in December 2013.

After over a year-and-a-half of being away from competition, Le faced Michael Bisping on August 23, 2014, at &quot;UFC Fight Night 48&quot;. After an even start, Le was cut around both eyes in the second round, as Bisping began to land the more powerful strikes. Bisping eventually won the one sided fight via TKO in the fourth round. Following the fight, Le tested positive for elevated levels of HGH and was subsequently suspended from competition for nine months. However, after reevaluating the evidence against Le, the UFC increased his suspension to 12 months. There has been some dispute of the test, as the testing laboratory in question was not WADA-approved, did not do the appropriate HGH test, and destroyed the blood sample before confirmatory tests could be done. Ultimately, on October 21, the UFC reversed their decision and rescinded Le&#x27;s suspension in light of the aforementioned flaws. On December 3, 2014, Le told the media that he instructed his manager to request Le&#x27;s release from UFC due to the drug-test dispute.

On December 16, 2014, Le was listed as one of three MMA fighters who filed a class-action lawsuit against Zuffa, LLC., the parent company of the UFC. The suit alleges that the UFC participated in anti-competitive practices that hindered fighters and their mixed martial arts careers. At the time Le was the only active fighter on the organization&#x27;s roster to be involved in the lawsuit.

===Retirement from MMA===
On January 20, 2015, his manager, Gary Ibarra, announced to the media that Le had retired from MMA. Le&#x27;s decision came after reconsidering his career with his family. He had previously expressed his lack of desire to fight in the UFC and contemplated retirement following the performance-enhancing drug disputes he had with the promotion in 2014. Le believed that the UFC owed him an apology for accusing him of using drugs when the test results later turned out to be faulty. Le, however, said that his retirement was only in MMA. He talked about the possibility of returning to professional kickboxing competitions, where he was active prior to his MMA debut.

==Acting career==
Le co-starred in the live-action &quot;Tekken&quot; film, based upon the popular martial arts fighting game, as Marshall Law, released November 5, 2009, for the American film market. Le had supporting roles in the science fiction film &quot;Pandorum&quot; with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster, and &quot;Fighting&quot;, released in 2009 alongside Channing Tatum. He also starred in a Hong Kong martial arts film &quot;Bodyguards and Assassins&quot;, which was released on December 18, 2009; his film was the first time he worked with and had a fight scene with Hong Kong martial arts superstar Donnie Yen.

He also appeared in a Vietnamese music show &quot;Paris By Night 99 – Tôi Là Người Việt Nam&quot; where he was interviewed by Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen; this show also marked one of the few times Le has spoken Vietnamese on camera.

Le had a lead role in the 2012 action film &quot;Dragon Eyes&quot;, costarring Jean-Claude Van Damme and produced by Joel Silver. The movie is based on the Akira Kurosawa classic &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and is &quot;MMA-themed&quot;. Also in 2012, Le played Bronze Lion in &quot;The Man with the Iron Fists&quot;, a film directed by RZA.

In 2014, he starred in &quot;Puncture Wounds&quot;, an action film directed by Giorgio Serafini, co-directed and written by James Coyne.

In 2015, he appeared as an abbot in the AMC TV series &quot;Into the Badlands&quot;.

In 2017, he appeared in the action movie &quot;Savage Dog&quot; alongside martial artists and action stars Scott Adkins and Marko Zaror.

<doc id="1146338" wikidata="Q3813244" url="?curid=1146338" title="Bogoliubov transformation">
<text>In theoretical physics, the Bogoliubov transformation, also known as the Bogoliubov–Valatin transformation, was independently developed in 1958 by Nikolay Bogolyubov and John George Valatin for finding solutions of BCS theory in a homogeneous system. The Bogoliubov transformation is an isomorphism of either the canonical commutation relation algebra or canonical anticommutation relation algebra. This induces an autoequivalence on the respective representations. The Bogoliubov transformation is often used to diagonalize Hamiltonians, which yields the stationary solutions of the corresponding Schrödinger equation. The Bogoliubov transformation is also important for understanding the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation, Davies-Fulling radiation (moving mirror model), pairing effects in nuclear physics, and many other topics.

The Bogoliubov transformation is often used to diagonalize Hamiltonians, &quot;with&quot; a corresponding transformation of the state function. Operator eigenvalues calculated with the diagonalized Hamiltonian on the transformed state function thus are the same as before.

== Single bosonic mode example ==

Consider the canonical commutation relation for bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the harmonic oscillator basis
:formula_1
Define a new pair of operators
:formula_2
:formula_3
for complex numbers &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, where the latter is the Hermitian conjugate of the first.

The Bogoliubov transformation is the canonical transformation mapping the operators formula_4 and formula_5 to formula_6 and formula_7. To find the conditions on the constants &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; such that the transformation is canonical, the commutator is evaluated, namely,
:formula_8
It is then evident that formula_9 is the condition for which the transformation is canonical.

Since the form of this condition is suggestive of the hyperbolic identity 
:formula_10
the constants and can be readily parametrized as
:formula_11
:formula_12
This is interpreted as a linear symplectic transformation of the phase space. By comparing to the Bloch–Messiah decomposition, the two angles formula_13 and formula_14 correspond to the orthogonal symplectic transformations (i.e., rotations) and the squeezing factor formula_15 corresponds to the diagonal transformation.

===Applications===
The most prominent application is by Nikolai Bogoliubov himself in the context of superfluidity. Other applications comprise Hamiltonians and excitations in the theory of antiferromagnetism. When calculating quantum field theory in curved spacetimes the definition of the vacuum changes, and a Bogoliubov transformation between these different vacua is possible. This is used in the derivation of Hawking radiation. Bogoliubov transforms are also used extensively in quantum optics, particularly when working with gaussian unitaries (such as beamsplitters, phase shifters, and squeezing operations).

== Fermionic mode ==

For the anticommutation relations
:formula_16
the Bogoliubov transformation is constrained by formula_17. Therefore, the only non-trivial possibility is formula_18 corresponding to particle–antiparticle interchange (or particle–hole interchange in many-body systems) with the possible inclusion of a phase shift. Thus, for a single particle, the transformation can only be implemented (1) for a Dirac fermion, where particle and antiparticle are distinct (as opposed to a Majorana fermion or chiral fermion), or (2) for multi-fermionic systems, in which there is more than one type of fermion.

===Applications===
The most prominent application is again by Nikolai Bogoliubov himself, this time for the BCS theory of superconductivity. The point where the necessity to perform a Bogoliubov transform becomes obvious is that in mean-field approximation the Hamiltonian of the system can be written in both cases as a sum of bilinear terms in the original creation and destruction operators, involving finite formula_19 terms, i.e. one must go beyond the usual Hartree–Fock method. In particular, in the mean-field Bogoliubov–de Gennes Hamiltonian formalism with a superconducting pairing term such as formula_20, the Bogoliubov transformed operators formula_21 annihilate and create quasiparticles (each with well-defined energy, momentum and spin but in a quantum superposition of electron and hole state), and have coefficients formula_22 and formula_23 given by eigenvectors of the Bogoliubov–de Gennes matrix. Also in nuclear physics, this method is applicable, since it may describe the &quot;pairing energy&quot; of nucleons in a heavy element.

== Multimode example ==
The Hilbert space under consideration is equipped with these operators, and henceforth describes a higher-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (usually an infinite-dimensional one).

The ground state of the corresponding Hamiltonian is annihilated by all the annihilation operators:

:formula_24

All excited states are obtained as linear combinations of the ground state excited by some creation operators:

:formula_25

One may redefine the creation and the annihilation operators by a linear redefinition:

:formula_26

where the coefficients formula_27 must satisfy certain rules to guarantee that the annihilation operators and the creation operators formula_28, defined by the Hermitian conjugate equation, have the same commutators 
for bosons and anticommutators for fermions.

The equation above defines the Bogoliubov transformation of the operators.

The ground state annihilated by all formula_29 is different from the original ground state formula_30, and they can be viewed as the Bogoliubov transformations of one another using the operator–state correspondence. They can also be defined as squeezed coherent states. BCS wave function is an example of squeezed coherent state of fermions.

== Unified matrix description ==
Because Bogoliubov transformations are linear recombination of operators, it is more convenient and insightful to write them in terms of matrix transformations. If a pair of annihilators formula_31 transform as
:formula_32

where formula_33 is a formula_34 matrix. Then naturally
:formula_35

For fermion operators, the requirement of commutation relations reflects in two requirements for the form of matrix formula_33

:formula_37

and 

:formula_38

For boson operators, the commutation relations require
:formula_39

and 

:formula_40

These conditions can be written uniformly as 
:formula_41
where
:formula_42
where formula_43 applies to fermions and bosons, respectively.

=== Diagonalizing a quadratic Hamiltonian using matrix description ===
Bogoliubov transformation lets us diagonalize a quadratic Hamiltonian
:formula_44
by just diagonalizing the matrix formula_45. 
In the notations above, it is important to distinguish the operator formula_46 and the numeric matrix formula_47.
This fact can be seen by rewriting formula_46 as
:formula_49

and formula_50 if and only if formula_33 diagonalizes formula_45, i.e. formula_53.

Useful properties of Bogoliubov transformations are listed below.

== Other applications ==

=== Fermionic condensates ===
Bogoliubov transformations are a crucial mathematical tool for understanding and describing fermionic condensates. They provide a way to diagonalize the Hamiltonian of an interacting fermion system in the presence of a condensate, allowing us to identify the elementary excitations, or quasiparticles, of the system.

In a system where fermions can form pairs, the standard approach of filling single-particle energy levels (the Fermi sea) is insufficient. The presence of a condensate implies a coherent superposition of states with different particle numbers, making the usual creation and annihilation operators inadequate. The Hamiltonian of such a system typically contains terms that create or annihilate pairs of fermions, such as:formula_54where formula_55 and formula_56 are the creation and annihilation operators for a fermion with momentum formula_57, formula_58 is the single-particle energy, and formula_59 is the pairing amplitude, which characterizes the strength of the condensate. This Hamiltonian is not diagonal in terms of the original fermion operators, making it difficult to directly interpret the physical properties of the system.

Bogoliubov transformations provide a solution by introducing a new set of quasiparticle operators, formula_60 and formula_61, which are linear combinations of the original fermion operators:formula_62where formula_63 and formula_64 are complex coefficients that satisfy the normalization condition formula_65. This transformation mixes particle and hole creation operators, reflecting the fact that the quasiparticles are a superposition of particles and holes due to the pairing interaction. This transformation was first introduced by N. N. Bogoliubov in his seminal work on superfluidity.

The coefficients formula_63 and formula_64 are chosen such that the Hamiltonian, when expressed in terms of the quasiparticle operators, becomes diagonal:formula_68where formula_69 is the ground state energy and formula_70 is the energy of the quasiparticle with momentum formula_57. The diagonalization process involves solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which are a set of self-consistent equations for the coefficients formula_63, formula_64, and the pairing amplitude formula_59. A detailed discussion of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations can be found in de Gennes&#x27; book on superconductivity.

==== Physical interpretation ====

The Bogoliubov transformation reveals several key features of fermion condensates:

* Quasiparticles: The elementary excitations of the system are not individual fermions but quasiparticles, which are coherent superpositions of particles and holes. These quasiparticles have a modified energy spectrum formula_75, which includes a gap of size formula_76 at zero momentum. This gap represents the energy required to break a Cooper pair and is a hallmark of superconductivity and other fermionic condensate phenomena.
* Ground state: The ground state of the system is not simply an empty Fermi sea but a state where all quasiparticle levels are unoccupied, i.e., formula_77 for all formula_57. This state, often called the BCS state in the context of superconductivity, is a coherent superposition of states with different particle numbers and represents the macroscopic condensate.
* Broken symmetry: The formation of a fermion condensate is often associated with the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry, such as the U(1) gauge symmetry in superconductors. The Bogoliubov transformation provides a way to describe the system in the broken symmetry phase. The connection between broken symmetry and Bogoliubov transformations is explored in Anderson&#x27;s work on pseudo-spin and gauge invariance.

<doc id="1146341" wikidata="Q307132" url="?curid=1146341" title="Abdelaziz of Morocco">
<text>&quot;Moulay&quot; Abd al-Aziz bin Hassan (), born on 24 February 1881 in Marrakesh and died on 10 June 1943 in Tangier, was a sultan of Morocco from 9 June 1894 to 21 August 1908, as a ruler of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty. He was proclaimed sultan at the age of sixteen after the death of his father Hassan I. Moulay Abdelaziz tried to strengthen the central government by implementing a new tax on agriculture and livestock, a measure which was strongly opposed by sections of the society. This in turn led Abdelaziz to mortgage the customs revenues and to borrow heavily from the French, which was met with widespread revolt and a revolution that deposed him in 1908 in favor of his brother Abd al-Hafid.

==Reign==
=== Early reign ===
Shortly before his death in 1894 Hassan I designed Mawlay Adb al-Aziz his heir, despite his young age, because his mother, Lalla Ruqaya Al Amrani was his favorite wife. (His mother is often confused to be Aisha, the favorite slave concubine of Georgian origins who was bought in Istanbul by the &quot;vizir&quot; Sidi Gharnat and brought to the Sultan’s harem &quot;circa&quot; 1876.) By the action of Ahmed bin Musa, the Chamberlain and Grand Wazir of the former sultan Hassan I, Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s accession to the sultanate was ensured with little fighting. Ba Ahmed became regent and for six years showed himself a capable ruler.

In 1895, tribes of southern Morocco rose up in rebellion. At the head of an army, Abd al-Aziz marched south and defeated the southern rebels, triumphantly entering Marrakesh in March 1896 with his regent Ahmed, capturing a large booty of horses and camels.

On his death in 1900 the regency ended, and Abdelaziz took the reins of government into his own hands and chose an Arab from the south, Mehdi al-Menebhi, as his chief adviser. On the same year, the French administration of Algeria called for the annexation of the Tuat region, which was part of Morocco back then, and owned religious and tributary allegiance to the sultans of Morocco. The territory was annexed by France in 1901. Subsequently, in 1903, France began to expand westwards towards Bechar and Tindouf, defeating the Moroccan forces in the Battle of Taghit and Battle of El-Moungar.

As urged by his mother, the sultan sought advice and counsel from Europe and endeavored to act on it, but advice not motivated by a conflict of interest was difficult to obtain, and in spite of the unquestionable desire of the young ruler to do what was best for the country, wild extravagance both in action and expenditure resulted, leaving the sultan with a depleted exchequer and the confidence of his people impaired. His intimacy with foreigners and his imitation of their ways were sufficient to rouse strong popular opposition.

While privately owned printing presses had been allowed since 1872, Abdelaziz passed a &quot;dhahīr&quot; in 1897 that regulated what could be printed, allowing the &quot;qadi&quot; of Fes to establish a board to censor publications, and requiring that the judges be notified of any publication, so as to &quot;avoid printing something that is not permitted.&quot; According to Abdallah Laroui, these restrictions limited the volume and variety of Moroccan publications at the turn of the century, and institutions such as al-Qarawiyyin University and Sufi zawiyas became dependent on imported texts from Egypt.

His attempt to reorganize the country&#x27;s finances by the systematic levy of taxes was hailed with delight, but the government was not strong enough to carry the measures through, and the money which should have been used to pay the taxes was employed to purchase firearms instead. And so the benign intentions of Moulay Abdelaziz were interpreted as weakness, and Europeans were accused of having spoiled the sultan and of being desirous of spoiling the country.

When British engineers were employed to survey the route for a railway between Meknes and Fes, this was reported as indicating the sale of the country outright. The strong opposition of the people was aroused, and a revolt broke out near the Algerian frontier. Such was the state of things when the news of the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904 came as a blow to Abdelaziz, who had relied on England for support and protection against the inroads of France.

===Algeciras Conference===

On the advice of Germany, Abdelaziz proposed an international conference at Algeciras in 1906 as a result of the First Moroccan Crisis in 1905, to consult upon methods of reform, the sultan&#x27;s desire being to ensure a state of affairs which would leave foreigners with no excuse to interfere in the control of the country and thereby promote its welfare, which he had earnestly desired from his accession to power. This was not, however, the result achieved (see main article), and while on June 18 the sultan nonetheless ratified the resulting Act of the conference, which the country&#x27;s delegates had found themselves unable to sign, the anarchic state into which Morocco fell during the latter half of 1906 and the beginning of 1907 revealed the young ruler as lacking sufficient strength to command the respect of his turbulent subjects.

The final Act of the Conference, signed on 7 April 1906, covered the organisation of Moroccan police and customs, regulations concerning the repression of the smuggling of armaments and concessions to the European bankers from a new State Bank of Morocco, issuing banknotes backed by gold, with a 40-year term. The new state bank was to act as Morocco&#x27;s Central Bank, with a strict cap on the spending of the Sherifian Empire, and administrators appointed by the national banks, which guaranteed the loans: the German Empire, United Kingdom, France and Spain. Spanish coinage continued to circulate. The right of Europeans to own land was established, whilst taxes were to be levied towards public works.
=== Opposition ===

==== Rebellion of Bu Himara ====

Jilali bin Idris al-Yusufi al-Zarhuni (Bu Hmara) appeared in north-east Morocco in 1902 claiming to be Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s older brother and the rightful heir to the throne. He had spent time in Fes and learned the politics of the Makhzen. The pretender to the throne established a rival makhzen in a remote region between Melilla and Oujda, traded with Europe and collected customs duties, imported arms, granted Europeans mining rights to Iron and Lead in the Rif, and claimed to be the &quot;mahdi&quot;. He easily defeated poorly-organised armies sent by Abdelaziz to defeat him, and even threatened the capital, Fes, which proved the Minister of War al-Manabhi an incompetent general. The rebellion lasted until Abdelaziz&#x27;s successor Abd al-Hafid defeated and executed Bu Hmara in 1909.

==== Rebellion of Ahmed al-Raysuni ====

Ahmed al-Raysuni, a warlord and leader of the Jibala tribal confederacy, started a rebellion against the sultan of Morocco, which gave other rebels the signal to defy the Makhzen. al-Raysuni built an independent power-center and invaded Tangier in 1903. Raysuni would kidnap Christians, including Greek American Ion Perdicaris, British journalist Walter Burton Harris, and Scottish military instructor Harry Maclean, and ransom them—in open defiance of the Makhzen of Abdelaziz. The Perdicaris Incident in 1904 was one of the most important of these incidents, leading to the involvement of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Spain. Raysuni demanded a ransom of $70,000 and six districts from the sultan, in which the sultan eventually complied with. Raysuni supported Abd al-Hafid in taking over the Moroccan throne in the Hafidiya coup in 1908, and continued the rebellion against the later Spanish colonisers, until he was captured and imprisoned in Tamassint by Abd al-Karim in 1925, where died a few months later on the same year.

==== Occupation of Oujda ====

On 19 March 1907, Émile Mauchamp, a French doctor, was assassinated by a mob in Marrakesh who stabbed him. The French press represented the murder as an &quot;unprovoked and random act of barbarous cruelty. Shortly after Mauchamp&#x27;s death, France took his death as a pretext to occupy Oujda from French Algeria, a Moroccan city on the border with French Algeria, on March 29 supposedly in retribution for the murder.
==== Bombardment of Casablanca ====

In July 1907, tensions rose even higher, when eight Europeans were murdered by tribesmen of the Chaouia—demanding removal of the French officers from the customs house, an immediate halt on the construction of the port, and the destruction of the railroad crossing over the Sidi Belyout cemetery—and incited a riot in Casablanca, calling for Jihad. European railroad workers were killed, leading to Casablanca&#x27;s bombardment by France, in which parts of the city were destroyed, and 1,500 to 7,000 civilians were killed. The French then sent an expeditionary force of 2,000 soldiers to the city, occupying it, and then moved into the plains surrounding the city while fighting the Chaouia in a pacification campaign.

=== Hafidiya ===

A few months earlier in May 1907, the southern aristocrats, led by the head of the Glawa tribe Si al-Madani al-Glawi, invited Abd al-Hafid, an elder brother of Abd al-Aziz, and viceroy of Marrakesh, to become sultan, and the following August Abd al-Hafid was proclaimed sovereign there with all the usual formalities. In September 1907, Abd al-Hafid gained the Bay&#x27;ah from Marrakesh, and in January 1908, the Ulama of Fes issued a &quot;conditional&quot; Bay&#x27;ah in support of Abd al-Hafid. The Bay&#x27;ah demanded that Abd al-Hafid abolishes gate taxes, liberates the French-occupied cities of Oujda and Casablanca, and confines Europeans to port cities. Soon after, Abd al-Aziz arrived at Rabat from Fes and endeavored to secure the support of the European powers against his brother. After months of inactivity Abd al-Aziz made an effort to restore his authority, and quitting Rabat in July he marched on Marrakesh. His force, largely owing to treachery, was completely overthrown on August 19 when nearing that city, and was defeated in the Battle of Marrakesh. Abd al-Aziz fled to Settat, within the French lines around Casablanca, where he announced his abdication two days later.

===End of rule===
In November he came to terms with his brother, and thereafter took up his residence in Tangier as a pensioner of the new sultan. However the exercise of Moroccan law and order continued to deteriorate under Abd al-Hafid, leading to the Treaty of Fes in 1912, in which European nations assumed many responsibilities for the sultanate, which was divided into three zones of influence, under the French protectorate and the Spanish protectorate, while Abd al-Hafid was succeeded by his brother Yusef.

== Mariages and children ==
Moulay Abdelaziz wedded two women, the first was Lalla Khadija bint Omar al-Yousi commonly known as Lalla Khaduj. And his second wife was a cousin of his, Lalla Yasmin al-Alaoui. He had two known children:

* Moulay Hassan (b. July 1899 - d. 1919) he was born in Marrakesh and died in Tangier aged 19 or 20 years old, his mother was Lalla Khadija. He was half-brother of Lalla Fatima Zahra.
* Lalla Fatima Zahra (b. 13 June 1927 - d. 15 September 2003) she was born in Tangier and died in Rabat aged 76 years old, her mother was Lalla Yasmin.

== Later life and death ==
In the course of 1919, Hubert Lyautey came to the conclusion that the return of Abdelaziz from his exile in France to Morocco would be desirable as it would remove his appeal as a potential rallying point for rebellion, and subsequently let him come to live in Tangier, by then a city under unsettled status that was part neither of the Spanish nor of the French protectorates. Abdelaziz led an active social but mostly nonpolitical life in the city, from 1925 the Tangier International Zone, where he spent much of his time playing golf and lived in various residences including the Villa Al Amana and the Zaharat El-Jebel Palace. During the Spanish annexation of Tangier in 1940, he acquiesced insofar as the Moroccan palace authorities called the &quot;makhzen&quot; played a significant role therein. 

Abdelaziz died in Tangier in 1943 and his body was transported to Fes, where he was buried in the royal necropolis of the Moulay Abdallah Mosque.

== Legacy ==
Historian Douglas Porch characterized Abdelaziz as curious and kind in his personal relations, but a spoiled and &quot;weak man&quot; who failed to successfully manage foreign influences at the court. During his reign he enabled reformers who sought to modernize the kingdom, and personally displayed a high interest in European inventions, but also failed to perform the traditional religious and ceremonial functions as expected of a ruler and thus lost the faith of his own people. 

He was portrayed by Marc Zuber in the film &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975), a fictional version of the Perdicaris affair.

<text>A cardiovascular perfusionist, clinical perfusionist or perfusiologist, and occasionally a cardiopulmonary bypass doctor or clinical perfusion scientist, is a healthcare professional who operates the cardiopulmonary bypass machine (heart–lung machine) during cardiac surgery and other surgeries that require cardiopulmonary bypass to manage the patient&#x27;s physiological status. As a member of the cardiovascular surgical team, the perfusionist also known as the clinical perfusionist helps maintain blood flow to the body&#x27;s tissues as well as regulate levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, using a heart–lung machine.

== Duties ==
Perfusionists form part of the wider cardiovascular surgical team which includes cardiac surgeons, anesthesiologists, and residents. Their role is to conduct extracorporeal circulation as well as ensure the management of physiologic functions by monitoring the necessary variables. The perfusionist provides consultation to the physician in selecting appropriate equipment and techniques to be used.

Other responsibilities include administering blood products, administering anesthetic agents or drugs, measuring selected laboratory values (such as blood cell count), monitoring circulation, monitoring blood gases, surveil anticoagulation, induction of hypothermia, and hemodilution. Sometimes, perfusionists are granted administrative tasks such as purchasing supplies or equipment, as well as personnel and departmental management.

=== Involved procedures ===
Perfusionists can be involved in a number of cardiac surgical procedures, select vascular procedures and a few other surgical procedures in an ancillary role.

Perfusionists may participate in curative or staged palliative procedures to treat the following pediatric pathologies:
* atrial septal defects,
* ventricular septal defects,
* tetralogy/pentalogy of Fallot,
* truncus arteriosus,
* transposition of the great vessels,
* cardiac transplants,
* lung transplants,
* coarctation of the aorta,
* interrupted aortic arch,
* hypoplastic left/right heart,
* subaortic membrane,
* mitral valve repair/replacement,
* aortic valve disorders,
* anomalous/single coronary artery,
* vascular ring,
* extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
Adult surgical procedures may include:
* coronary artery bypass,
* aortic valve replacements,
* mitral valve repair/mitral valve replacement
* tricuspid valve repair
* aortic root replacements
* atrial myxomas
* dissections/aneurysms/trauma of the aorta (ascending, arch &amp; descending)
* renal cell carcinoma/obstructive vena cava
* veno-venous bypass (e.g. during liver transplants)
* cardiac/lung transplants
* implants of ventricular assist device and ECMO.
Select ancillary procedures in which perfusion techniques and/or perfusionists may be involved include isolated limb perfusion, intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion and tracheal resection/repair.

==Training and certification==
===United States===

In the United States, a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree is a prerequisite for admission into an accredited perfusion program, typically with a concentration in biology, chemistry, anatomy and physiology, varying depending on specific perfusion program. As of 2022, there are 18 accredited perfusion training programs, of which ten are master&#x27;s degrees, seven are certificate programs, and one is a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Training typically consists of two years of academic and clinical education. A perfusion student will typically begin his or her training in a didactic fashion in which the student will closely follow instructions from a certified clinical perfusionist in the confines of a cardiac surgery procedure. Academic coursework may be concurrent or precede this clinical instruction. Early in their clinical training, the perfusion student may have little involvement outside of an observational role. However, as time progresses, more tasks may be incrementally delegated to them. Upon graduating from a perfusion program, the graduate must begin the certification process. In the interim, the perfusion graduate is typically referred to as board-eligible, which is sufficient for employment in cardiac surgery with the understanding that achieving certified status is required for long-term employment. Most employers have stipulations on the duration of board-eligible status.

To become certified as a certified clinical perfusionist, a perfusionist must undergo a two-part exam administered by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion. The first part is the Perfusion Basic Science Exam and the second part the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam. The exam process is open to a perfusion student that has graduated or about to graduate from an accredited perfusion education program. In addition, a perfusion student must have participated in a minimum of 75 perfusions during the course of their training before sitting for the Perfusion Basic Science Exam and performed 40 independent perfusions after graduation before sitting for the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam. Upon passing the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam, the perfusionist is designated a certified clinical perfusionist.

Following certification, perfusionists must be recertified every year by attaining minimum clinical and educational requirements. Proof of fulfillment of these recertification requirements must be submitted to the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion and are mandatory to maintain certified status to use the designation.

As of February 2010, there were 3,766 certified perfusionists in the United States and approximately 300 certified perfusionists in Canada.

===Canada===
In Canada, there are three training programs: Burnaby in Western Canada, Toronto and Montreal in Eastern Canada. British Columbia Institute of Technology in Burnaby offers an advanced specialty certificate in cardiovascular perfusion to graduates of its two-year program. Applicants must be certified respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, or cardiac professionals with two years or more of current experience in cardiac critical care. Applicants to the Michener Institute program in Toronto must have a bachelor&#x27;s degree at minimum, with or without respiratory therapy, nursing or other clinical certification. The master&#x27;s program is two years. The perfusion program of the Université de Montréal is a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree of 90 credits in biomedical science of which 27 credits are specific to clinical perfusion and in addition a diplôme d’études supérieurs spécialisées (DESS) of 30 credits in clinical perfusion of one-year at the master level.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a science subject (usually life or clinical sciences) is a prerequisite to enrolment on the two-year perfusion training course. Trainees must complete a two-year MSc program at the University of Bristol while employed as a trainee perfusionist by a sponsoring hospital trust. This post is paid as an annex U AfC band 7. They complete academic assessments (essays and exams), while in the workplace moving from a purely observational role to one in which they are capable of managing the patient while they are on cardiopulmonary system with minimal supervision. Once a trainee has been the primary perfusionist in 150 clinical procedures, they must undertake a practical exam. For this exam, the candidate is observed by two external examiners whilst building and priming a cardiopulmonary circuit, then using it during a surgical operation. After the practical exam, trainees must complete a 40-minute &quot;viva voce&quot; exam, which tests their academic knowledge. After this is successfully completed, they are awarded an MSc in Clinical Perfusion Science and the status of accredited clinical perfusion scientist. They must maintain this by performing a minimum of 40 clinical procedures per year.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In some states of Australia and New Zealand, a perfusionist must have at least a science degree (usually in health sciences) as an entry requirement before training. Further didactic training is in a practical format at a hospital whilst doing a three-year course via correspondence and e-learning, with the Australian and New Zealand College of Perfusionists (ANZCP). The final examination for a clinical perfusionist is administered by the ANZCP over two days. This involves three hours of written assessment, two hours of multiple choice questions, and four half-hour &quot;viva voce&quot;. Perfusion training is determined by the hospital at which the perfusionist is employed and may involve a hospital accredited training program which is determined by the health department to be the equivalent of ANZCP certification program.

In Australia perfusion can also be provided by a medically trained physician who has undertaken additional subspecialty training.

===India===
In India, there are different programs for educating perfusionists. A three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program (most common) with one-year internship, a two-year post-graduate diploma are available. Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree in some reputed institutions (i.e. PGI Chandigarh, AIIMS New Delhi, jipmer, Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, naryana groups Bangalore, Sawai Mansingh Medical College Jaipur, Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar). Recently, the Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion of India introduced certification.

===Other countries===
In China, Egypt, and some South American countries, a clinical perfusionist is a medical doctor who has completed subspecialty training.
In Argentina, a perfusionist is a medical doctor, usually a cardiologist, who has undertaken additional sub-specialty training. They are often referred to as &quot;hemodinamistas&quot; (hemodynamics specialists).

In Europe, perfusionist education standards are set by the European organisation of perfusion, EBCP (The European Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion) and has been implemented in many European countries. The length of the eduacation and training varies between 1 and 4 years, depending on requirements for entering the program.
In the northern countries of Europe, Scandinavia including Sweden, Denmark and Norway, perfusionists are educated at Aarhus University at the Scandinavian School of Cardiopulmonary Technology. Most perfusionist candidates are educated intensive care nurses/anaesthetic nurses and the education includes a Master Thesis in Cardiopulmonary Technology.

<doc id="1146348" wikidata="Q2874705" url="?curid=1146348" title="Awni Abd al-Hadi">
<text>Awni Abd al-Hadi, () aka Auni Bey Abdel Hadi and Awni Abdul Hadi (1889, Nablus, Ottoman Empire – 15 March 1970, Cairo, Egypt) was a Palestinian political figure. He was educated in Beirut, Istanbul, and at the Sorbonne University in Paris. His wife was Tarab Abd al-Hadi, a Palestinian activist and feminist.

==Political activity==
In 1911 Abd al-Hadi, along with Rafiq al-Tamimi were founding members of the Paris-based underground al-Fatat (&quot;the Young Arab Society&quot;) nationalist society, which was devoted to Arab independence and unity. He was among the organizers of the Arab Congress of 1913 in Paris. When Faisal I of Iraq arrived in Paris en route to London in December 1918 Ahmad Qadri located Abd al-Hadi introduced him to Faisal who appointed him as the head of the administrative office for the Arab delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919.
Abd al-Hadi was later an adviser to Amir Abdullah in Transjordan.

On his return to Palestine in 1924, Abd al-Hadi became one of the chief spokesmen of the Palestinian Arab nationalist movement and was elected representative to the 5th (August 1922, Nablus) and 6th (June 1923, Jaffa) Congress of the Arab Executive Committee for Jenin and to the 7th (June 1928) for Beisan. He was secretary of the Executive Committee&#x27;s Congress in 1928.

In 1930 Abd al-Hadi was a member of the Palestinian Arab delegation to the United Kingdom and a lawyer for the Supreme Muslim Council. In August 1932 he was a founder, general secretary and first elected president of the Independence Party of Palestine, the first regularly constituted Palestinian Arab political party. He was also the party&#x27;s representative on the Arab Higher Committee, formed in April 1936, for which he served as general secretary. Abd al-Hadi was a moderate who was prepared to negotiate with members of the &quot;Yishuv&quot;.

Abd al-Hadi held some responsibility for the Arab revolt of 1936–39. The Istiqlal Party was banned and he, who was out of the territory at the time, was banned from re-entry to Palestine. The British administration also deported three committee members and two other political leaders in 1937 (until 1941). He was a member of the Palestinian delegation to the London Conference in February 1939.

After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Awni Abd al-Hadi ended up in Cairo, Egypt with his wife, Tarab Abdul Hadi. In 1948, Abd al-Hadi was a member and appointed Minister for Social Affairs of the Egyptian-sponsored All-Palestine Government headed by Amin al-Husayni. From 1951 to 1955, he was Jordan&#x27;s minister and later ambassador to Cairo. He was Minister of Justice from July 1956 to October 1956. From 1955 to 1958, he was a Jordanian senator and from 1958 chairman of the Arab League&#x27;s Legal committee in Cairo.

Abd al-Hadi died on 15 March 1970 in Cairo.

<doc id="1146355" wikidata="Q207683" url="?curid=1146355" title="Canzona">
<text>The canzona is an Italian musical form derived from the Franco-Flemish and Parisian &quot;chansons&quot;, and during Giovanni Gabrieli&#x27;s lifetime was frequently spelled canzona, though both earlier and later the singular was spelled either canzon or canzone with the plural canzoni. The use of canzone as the plural is sometimes found in Italian, but is not common. English (and often German) uses the form canzona, with canzonas as the plural.

==Background==
The canzona is an instrumental musical form that differs from the similar forms of ricercare and fantasia in its livelier, markedly rhythmic material and separation into distinct sections. At first based on the Franco-Flemish polyphonic songs (chansons) that gave it its name, the instrumental canzona was soon independently composed, not least by Gabrieli in his brass canzonas and by Girolamo Frescobaldi in his keyboard canzonas. As a form, the canzona would influence the fugue, and the ensemble canzonas were the direct ancestors of the 17th-century &quot;sonata da chiesa&quot;.

<doc id="1146360" wikidata="Q276936" url="?curid=1146360" title="Abd al-Hafid of Morocco">
<text>Abd al-Hafid of Morocco () or Moulay Abdelhafid (24 February 1875 – 4 April 1937) () was the Sultan of Morocco from 1908 to 1912 and a member of the Alaouite Dynasty. His younger brother, Abdelaziz of Morocco, preceded him. While Mulay Abdelhafid initially opposed his brother for giving some concessions to foreign powers, he himself became increasingly backed by the French and finally signed the protectorate treaty giving &quot;de facto&quot; control of the country to France.

== Hafidiya ==

After his brother Abdelaziz appointed him as &quot;Khalifa&quot; of Marrakesh, Abdelhafid sought to have him overthrown by fomenting distrust over Abdelaziz&#x27;s European ties. Abdelhafid was aided by Madani al-Glaoui, older brother of T&#x27;hami, one of the Caids of the Atlas. He was assisted in the training of his troops by Andrew Belton, a British officer and veteran of the Second Boer War. In February 1908, Abdelhafid was proclaimed the Sultan of Fes. For a brief period, Abdelaziz reigned from Rabat while Abdelhafid reigned in Marrakesh and Fes. In August 1908 Abdelaziz was defeated in battle. In 1909, Abdelhafid became the recognized leader of Morocco.

Writing contemporaneously about his rule in 1909, George Frederick Andrews says that Abdelhafid &quot;must play a very shrewd game. To maintain his authority over the tribes he must continue to appear decidedly anti-European in his feelings and his policy. On the other hand he must have money and the money must come from Europe. Also he knows that Morocco must submit to such reforms as have been decreed by the conference of the powers.&quot;

== Despotism ==
Muhammad al-Kattani, the influential Sufi poet and activist of Fes, was captured, tortured, and beaten to death in front of his wives and children in 1909.

In 1910, Lalla Batoul, a Fesi aristocrat and the wife of a former governor of Fes and supporter of Abdelaziz, was tortured. She was chained to the wall in a crucifixion position, completely naked with her breasts seized in a vice, and whipped and interrogated about the whereabouts of her husband&#x27;s fortune under the direct supervision of Abdelhafid. Walter Burton Harris reported on the incident in an article published in the &quot;Times of Morocco&quot;.

== Treaty of Fes, abdication, retirement and death==
In 1911, rebellion broke out against the Sultan. This led to the Agadir Crisis, also known as the Second Moroccan Crisis. These events led Abdelhafid to sign the Treaty of Fez on 30 March 1912, which made Morocco a French protectorate.

A few months later, Resident-General Hubert Lyautey persuaded Abdel Hafid to abdicate against the payment of a massive pension, part of which was used to build the opulent Abdelhafid Palace in Tangier, completed in 1914. His brother Yusef was proclaimed Sultan by the French administration on 13 August 1912. Yusef was chosen by dignitaries of Rabat, to which he soon relocated to escape the instability in Fez. Abdel Hafid signed his abdication while already on the quay in Rabat, with the ship that would take him to France waiting. During his extended visit in France, he received a great deal of attention from the press. He later returned to Morocco to live in Tangier.

Abd al-Hafid died in Enghien-les-Bains, France, on 4 April 1937. His body was transported to Fez, where he was buried in the royal mausoleum of the Moulay Abdallah Mosque.

== Marriages and children ==
By marriage five of Moulay Abd al-Hafid&#x27;s children are recorded. He wedded four women:

# Lalla Rabia bint Madani el Glaoui, they married around 1905 and she died in 1924. together they had two sons and two daughters, among them:

<doc id="1146369" wikidata="Q878077" url="?curid=1146369" title="Ice cap">
<text>In glaciology, an ice cap is a mass of ice that covers less than of land area (usually covering a highland area). Larger ice masses covering more than are termed ice sheets.

== Description ==
Ice caps are not constrained by topographical features (i.e., they will lie over the top of mountains). By contrast, ice masses of similar size that &quot;are&quot; constrained by topographical features are known as ice fields. The &quot;dome&quot; of an ice cap is usually centred on the highest point of a massif. Ice flows away from this high point (the ice divide) towards the ice cap&#x27;s periphery.

Ice caps significantly affect the geomorphology of the area they occupy. Plastic moulding, gouging and other glacial erosional features become present upon the glacier&#x27;s retreat. Many lakes, such as the Great Lakes in North America, as well as numerous valleys have been formed by glacial action over hundreds of thousands of years.

The Antarctic and Greenland contain 99% of the ice volume on earth, about of total ice mass.

== Formation ==
Ice caps are formed when snow is deposited during the cold season and fails to completely melt during the hot season. Over time, the snow builds up and becomes dense, well-bonded snow known as perennial firn. Finally, the air passages between snow particles close off and transforms into ice.

The shape of an ice cap is determined by the landscape it lies on, as melting patterns can vary with terrain. For example, the lower portions of an ice cap are forced to flow outwards under the weight of the entire ice cap and will follow the downward slopes of the land.

== Global warming ==
Ice caps have been used as indicators of global warming, as increasing temperatures cause ice caps to melt and lose mass faster than they accumulate mass. Ice cap size can be monitored through different remote-sensing methods such as aircraft and satellite data.

Ice caps accumulate snow on their upper surfaces, and ablate snow on their lower surfaces. An ice cap in equilibrium accumulates and ablates snow at the same rate. The AAR is the ratio between the accumulation area and the total area of the ice cap, which is used to indicate the health of the glacier. Depending on their shape and mass, healthy glaciers in equilibrium typically have an AAR of approximately 0.4 to 0.8. The AAR is impacted by environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation.

Data from 86 mountain glaciers and ice caps shows that over the long term, the AAR of glaciers has been about 0.57. In contrast, data from the most recent years of 1997–2006 yields an AAR of only 0.44. In other words, glaciers and ice caps are accumulating less snow and are out of equilibrium, causing melting and contributing to sea level rises.

Assuming the climate continues to be in the same state as it was in 2006, it is estimated that ice caps will contribute a 95 ± 29  mm rise in global sea levels until they reach equilibrium. However, environmental conditions have worsened and are predicted to continue to worsen in the future. Given that the rate of melting will accelerate, and by using mathematical models to predict future climate patterns, the actual contribution of ice caps to rising sea levels is expected to be more than double from initial estimates.

== Variants ==

High-latitude regions covered in ice, though strictly not an ice cap (since they exceed the maximum area specified in the definition above), are called polar ice caps; the usage of this designation is widespread in the mass media and arguably recognized by experts.
Vatnajökull is an example of an ice cap in Iceland.

Plateau glaciers are glaciers that overlie a generally flat highland area. Usually, the ice overflows as hanging glaciers in the lower parts of the edges. An example is Biscayarfonna in Svalbard.

<text>Lalique is a French luxury glassmaker, founded by renowned glassmaker and jeweller René Lalique in 1888. Lalique is best known for producing glass art, including perfume bottles, vases, and hood ornaments during the early twentieth century. Following the death of René, Lalique transitioned to producing lead glass (crystal) works during the 1950s while under the direction of René&#x27;s son, Marc Lalique. In 2010, Lalique was purchased by a Swiss company named Art &amp; Fragrance SA, now known as Lalique Group SA.

==History==

René Lalique (1860–1945) began his career as a jewellery apprentice at the age of 16, and by 1881 he was a freelance designer for many of the best-known Parisian jewellers. In 1885, he opened his own workshop on Place Gaillon in Paris, the former workshop of Jules Destape. In 1887, Lalique opened a business on Rue du Quatre-Septembre, and registered the &quot;RL&quot; mark the following year. In 1890, he opened a shop in the Opera District of Paris. Within a decade, Lalique was amongst the best-known Parisian jewellers.
In 1905, Lalique opened a new shop at Place Vendôme which exhibited not only jewellery, but glass works as well. It was close to the shop of renowned perfumer François Coty; in 1907, Lalique began producing ornate perfume bottles for Coty. The production of glass objects began at his country villa in 1902, and continued there until at least 1912. The first Lalique glassworks opened in 1909 in a rented facility in Combs-la-Ville, which Lalique later purchased in 1913. In December 1912, Lalique hosted an exhibition of Lalique Glass—as his glass would come to be known—at the Place Vendôme shop. During the First World War, the glassworks produced mundane items in support of the war effort. In 1919, work began on a new production facility in Wingen-sur-Moder, which opened in 1921. From 1925 to 1931, Lalique produced 29 models of hood ornaments; a mermaid statuette first produced in 1920 was also later sold as a hood ornament. During the 1920s and 1930s, Lalique was amongst the world&#x27;s most renowned glassmakers.

René Lalique died in 1945. His son Marc Lalique took over the business, operating initially as &quot;M.Lalique&quot; and later as &quot;Cristal Lalique&quot;. Under Marc&#x27;s leadership, the company transitioned from producing its famous Lalique Glass to producing lead glass, commonly known as &quot;crystal&quot;. Marie-Claude Lalique took control of the company following Marc&#x27;s death in 1977. It was sold to Pochet in 1994 and to a partnership of Art &amp; Fragrance and the holding company Financière Saint-Germain in 2008. Since 2010, Cristal Lalique has been wholly owned by Art &amp; Fragrance, who rebranded in 2016 as Lalique Group. The company is ultimately owned by Silvio Denz, an entrepreneur and Swiss national.

==Works==

Today, Lalique produces an array of luxury products in five main categories: jewellery, decorative items, interior design, perfumes, and art. The company is best known for the production of artistic glass works and fragrances such as Lalique Encre Noire, primarily using crystal (lead glass) since the mid-twentieth century. The addition of perfumes (in 1992) and non-glass decorative items and art (since 2011) are recent additions to Lalique&#x27;s product line. Reproductions of designs by René Lalique have increased since 2009.

From its founding until the 1900s–1910s, Lalique was one of France&#x27;s foremost Art Nouveau jewellery designers. Famous for designs combining precious stones and metals with non precious materials such as horn, glass amd enamel. In the first two decades of the twentieth century, Lalique transitioned into one of the world&#x27;s most renowned makers of artistic glass objects. During the first half of the twentieth century, Lalique produced perfume bottles, vases (about 300 designs), hood ornaments (30 designs), and decorative glass works, such as inkwells, bookends, and paperweights. Sometimes collaborating with his daughter Suzanne Lalique, Lalique also designed several interiors, incorporating copious amounts of glass, including interiors for: the SS &quot;Paris&quot;, the SS &quot;Ile de France&quot;, the SS &quot;Normandie&quot;, Orient Express railroad cars, Peace Hotel (Shanghai), Oviatt Building (Los Angeles), and St Matthew&#x27;s Church (Jersey).

==Factory==
The company&#x27;s sole production facility is the &quot;Cristallerie Lalique&quot; in Wingen-sur-Moder. It was opened in 1921 as the &quot;Verrerie d&#x27;Alsace&quot; (Alsace Glassworks) and given its present name in 1962.

<doc id="1146375" wikidata="Q12180" url="?curid=1146375" title="Door knocker">
<text>A door knocker is an item of door furniture that allows people outside a house or other dwelling or building to alert those inside to their presence. A door knocker has a part fixed to the door, and a part (usually metal) which is attached to the door by a hinge, and may be lifted and used to strike a plate fitted to the door, or the door itself, making a noise. The struck plate, if present, would be supplied and fitted with the knocker. Door knockers are often ornate, but may be no more than a simple fitting with a metal bob, or ring.

==Types==
German professor Franz Sales Meyer distinguished three kinds of door knocker: the &quot;ring&quot;, the &quot;hammer&quot;, and an ornate category which could take the shape of an animal or another figure. High demand for antique door knockers in the early 20th century in the United States caused forged versions to emerge.

<text>The Gloucester dory is a variant of the Banks dory, a type of narrow-bottomed, slab-sided boat, common in the North Eastern United States. It is characteristically smaller and lighter, with less overhang, both bow and stern, and less freeboard. It retains the Banks dory&#x27;s slab sides. Gloucester dories were designed to be launched through the surf behind a breakwater for daily fishing and lobstering off the Massachusetts shore. 

Because of its simple lines, a Gloucester dory is relatively easy to build. With the straight sides and flat bottom, stitch and glue techniques work well with this boat.

<doc id="1146408" wikidata="Q7113430" url="?curid=1146408" title="Over time limit">
<text>In car rallying, over time limit (universally abbreviated as OTL) is a situation where a crew has fallen so far behind their scheduled time that, in most rallies, they are excluded from further competition.

The purpose of OTL is to set a limit on crews so that marshals and other personnel involved in running a rally only need to wait a fixed amount of time after the last car was due before closing the control. Without OTL it could be very difficult to run a rally smoothly without having huge numbers of volunteers willing to wait around indefinitely.

For crews in a stage rally, OTL is a fixed limit of accrued lateness, after which one is no longer allowed to continue to compete. Lateness itself is not necessarily the result of a lack of competitiveness - for example a 10-minute roadside repair on a non-competitive section would not count against that crew&#x27;s recorded stage times, etc., but it would count towards lateness. Many rallies feature special controls and breaks which allow any accrued lateness to be reset. In certain rallies (mainly road and navigational) it is also possible to make back lateness during the normal course of the event, subject to certain restrictions. Also any lateness incurred due to a decision of the organisers or force majeure (i.e. an alteration of the route or hold-up) is not counted against the total lateness.

In a navigational rally or road rally then any crew which turns up at a time control OTL is deemed not to have visited it at all and penalised accordingly: either excluded if the control is a main time control; or typically 30 minutes or 1 fail for other controls.

The official expansion of the term OTL is &quot;over total lateness&quot;, although in everyday use only &quot;over time limit&quot; is generally used.

In Australian rallying, the term &quot;out of late time&quot; (OLT) is used. Whilst not a term used in the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport&#x27;s Manual of Motor Sport (neither is over time limit), it is a term used commonly on Australian rallying websites in event reports and also in event results.

<text>Sentinel is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics as part of the Tsunami imprint. It was written by Sean McKeever and illustrated by UDON. The story concerns a young boy called Juston Seyfert who finds and befriends a mutant-hunting Sentinel robot.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Sentinel&quot; was originally launched in 2003 as one of the seven titles that launched Marvel Comics&#x27; Tsunami imprint of manga-influenced series. The imprint was the idea of Marvel editor C. B. Cebulski. Despite featuring a different style to most of the company&#x27;s other work at that point and some uncharacteristic story ideas, &quot;Sentinel&quot; and its fellow Tsunami titles were still part of the Marvel Universe. Sean McKeever was considered a rising star in the industry at the time by Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada.

McKeever felt the series was a teen drama with fantasy elements, and felt the story wasn&#x27;t an X-Men spin-off &quot;in any real sense&quot;, and purposefully sited &quot;Sentinel&quot; in remote Wisconsin to avoid crossing over. McKeever himself was born in Wisconsin, and would later create another Marvel character from the state, the superhero Gravity, feeling it was important to have characters spread out geographically. However, he did suggest that a &quot;third-string mutant&quot; might be an interesting guest character in future arcs. Editor Marc Sumerak worked on the pitch with McKeever.

As with other Tsunami titles, the series was structured in six-issue plot arcs, which would then be issued in digest-sized low-price trade paperbacks soon after single issue publication. Art duties were handled by Udon Studios; Eric Vedder, Joe Vriens and Scott Hepburn worked on the series. The series ran for 12 issues before being cancelled. A second series returned in November 2005, this time as a five-issue limited series.

== Plot summary ==
===Salvage===
Juston Seyfert is an ordinary human teenager tormented by the seniors at Antigo High School in Wisconsin. He lives with his younger brother Chris and his father Peter, who operates a junkyard adjacent to their house; his mother walked out on the family years ago. Being poor, Juston must find his own fun, and spends the days playing in the salvage yard or constructing robots from spare parts. One day Juston finds a micro-processor which he then places into a &#x27;Battle-Bot&#x27; that he and his friends use. During the battle the robot disappears into the junkyard; unbeknownst to Juston, the processor was actually the remains of a giant robot programmed to exterminate mutants: a Sentinel. Soon after, Juston fell for fellow student Jessie Ingram. A few days after the event, Just discovers the battle bot and the half re-built Sentinel in his junkyard. Initially frightened by the discovery, he begins to assist the rebuilding from scrap metal and reprogramming it; the two form something of a bond.

However, Juston soon discovers the Sentinel&#x27;s original purpose while searching online and coming across an article featuring the X-Men. He programs the Sentinel to not hurt anybody before installing the final component, and creates a harness for himself and goes on an adventure with the Sentinel. The bullies that had plague Juston hurt one of his friends and turn Jessie against him with by lying that Juston was gossiping that the pair had &quot;hooked-up&quot;. Hurt and humiliated, Juston returns to the Sentinel, contemplating using it for revenge. The next day, Jessie tries to find Juston to talk with him when the Sentinel arrives and begins attacking the school, targeting the two bullies specifically. Before they can be hurt, Juston smashes a hot-wired jeep into the Sentinel, causing it to fall and retreat. It is later revealed that Juston staged the entire attack to earn positive standing at school and in the community, but he begins to feel guilt for the physical and psychological repercussions of his actions. He decides the best course is to use his Sentinel for good.

===No Hero/Awakening===
After having the Sentinel lie low in a lake, Juston gets an opportunity to do so when a plane appears overhead one night. While the rescue is successful he and his Sentinel are almost caught trying to save the survivors. The CSA, investigating the Sentinel attack on the school, arrive on the scene and begin attacking the Sentinel in an effort to reclaim it. The Sentinel fights back, despite Juston&#x27;s orders, which puts their relationship in further strain. Juston is unaware that the Sentinel is secretly repairing its prime directive; the robot begins to hunt mutants once again leading to a final confrontation with the head CSA Agent, who was secretly a mutant and deduced that Juston was controlling the Sentinel. Against Juston&#x27;s orders, the Sentinel kills the Agent, so Juston is free of suspicion, but the Sentinel is damaged and confiscated. Juston decides to run away and free the Sentinel, then uses its DNA detection skills to look for his long-lost mother.

===Past Imperfect===
Juston&#x27;s friends and family worry about his absence, and his father does his best to try to find him. Meanwhile, Juston stumbles upon data indicating that his Sentinel was in fact used by a previous owner who used it for murder of a non-mutant. He discovers that senator Jeff Knudsen and military official Colonel Archibald Hunt had worked together to take out Senator Knudsen&#x27;s rival using the Sentinel. In Washington D.C., they discover the Sentinel is loose and could incriminate the both of them, leaving them with one option - destroy it and anybody who knows about it. To do this, they use a new, experimental &quot;stealth&quot; Sentinel Mark VII-A. Juston&#x27;s search for his mother leads him to an estranged aunt named Ginny Baker, who allows him in only with the hope that she be repaid with money that he received from all his media appearances following his &quot;heroics&quot; at the school from the previous volume. When he tells her he does not have any, Ginny cruelly reveals that she left him and his family because she did not love them. Ginny calls the local news, leading his father right to her as well. The stealth Sentinel catches up to Juston and his Sentinel and engages them. It is defeated, but not before doing serious damage.

The Sentinel - acting on its directive to protect Juston - takes the opportunity to not only repair itself, but to also build a cockpit for Juston to operate from the inside. Juston makes his way back to Antigo, but is ambushed by the Stealth Sentinel who removes his Sentinel&#x27;s hand. Juston&#x27;s Sentinel and the Stealth Sentinel do battle while Juston tries to protect his family and friends. The stealth Sentinel, now manually controlled by Colonel Hunt, is about to land the killing blow when Knudsen disables the control system in a show of mercy. Juston destroys the stealth Sentinel, and swears to Knudsen and Hunt that if the pair comes after him or his Sentinel he will reveal their secret. Juston reunites with his father and he learns the truth about his mother. He then returns to school to meet Jessie and the rest of his friends again.

<doc id="1146427" wikidata="Q6504946" url="?curid=1146427" title="Lawson, New South Wales">
<text>Lawson is a town in the Blue Mountains area of New South Wales, Australia. It is located on the Great Western Highway between Hazelbrook in the east and Bullaburra in the west. Lawson has a station on the Main Western line. The town is also served by a public swimming pool and over the years has developed into the commercial hub of the mid-mountains area, which spans from Linden to Bullaburra, boasting a significant industrialized area as well as a shopping centre located on the south-eastern side of the highway.

==History==
One of the first settlements on the eastern slopes of the Blue Mountains, Lawson was identified on early maps as 24 Mile Hollow–a name which was changed to Christmas Swamp for a few years. When the Blue Mountain Inn was opened in 1848, the locals adopted the name Blue Mountain for the village. This name was also given to the original railway station after the Main Western railway line was pushed through in 1867. The presence of a Blue Mountain on the Blue Mountains, however, became so confusing to visitors that the authorities stepped in and renamed the village Lawson in honour of William Lawson who, along with William Wentworth and Gregory Blaxland, were the first Europeans to cross the Blue Mountains in 1813.

In 1931, the Railway Department agreed to supply electricity to the Blue Mountains Shire Council. Power lines were constructed between Blackheath and Lawson, accompanied by a maintenance track. The authorities then decided to promote the maintenance track as a walking trail; it became known as Bruce&#x27;s Walk, after the surveyor who planned it. The track later became neglected and forgotten, until it was rediscovered and improved by bushwalkers in the 1980s. It can now be followed from Medlow Bath to the north side of Lawson, although it is not shown on the relevant topographic map.

In more recent years, Lawson was at the centre of controversy due to an ongoing government proposal to widen the Great Western Highway. The highway was a single lane in each direction through the town; the proposed plan by the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority for widening necessitated the removal and relocation of the existing shops and the demolition of the Lawson Community Centre, formerly known as the Mechanics&#x27; Institute Hall, which dated back to 1903. Groups opposed to the demolition claimed the hall could be re-sited; others claimed this would be too costly, that the building was in poor repair and contained dangerous levels of asbestos. There was also a group lobbying for the retention of the shops on heritage grounds. By the end of 2008, the Community Centre had been saved.

== Heritage listings ==
Lawson has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks
* Main Western railway: Lawson railway station
*Honour Avenue

== Population ==
According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 2,651 people in Lawson.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.3% of the population. 
* 79.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.7%. 
* 91.0% of people only spoke English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 52.4%, Catholic 15.7% and Anglican 9.9%.

== Attractions ==
The walks in South Lawson can be accessed from several points along Honour Ave, within easy walk of the train station. This includes the South Lawson Waterfall Circuit, with four waterfalls: Adelina Falls, Cataract Falls, Federal Falls and Junction Falls. While not having the height of upper mountains waterfalls, the waterfall walk can be completed in 2-3 hours. 
On the north side of town beyond the swimming centre, walks take in Fairy Falls, Dante&#x27;s Glen, St Michael&#x27;s Falls, and Echo Bluff (sometimes referred to as Echo Point).

Community activities include: Magpie Markets at Lawson Public School are held on the third Sunday on most months (2nd Sunday December, no market in January) In November, the &quot;Love Lawson Festival&quot;, later changed to the Mid Mountains Festival is held in conjunction with the Magpie Markets celebrating what is good about living in Lawson and the mid mountains.

The historic Lawson Community Hall (Mechanics Institute) built in 1903 has now reopened after a long battle to save it from demolition due to road widening, and is now the location of numerous community activities.

<doc id="1146433" wikidata="Q2004951" url="?curid=1146433" title="Cartan matrix">
<text>In mathematics, the term Cartan matrix has three meanings. All of these are named after the French mathematician Élie Cartan. Amusingly, the Cartan matrices in the context of Lie algebras were first investigated by Wilhelm Killing, whereas the Killing form is due to Cartan.

== Lie algebras ==
A (symmetrizable) generalized Cartan matrix is a square matrix formula_1 with integer entries such that

# For diagonal entries, formula_2.
# For non-diagonal entries, formula_3.
# formula_4 if and only if formula_5
# formula_6 can be written as formula_7, where formula_8 is a diagonal matrix, and formula_9 is a symmetric matrix.

For example, the Cartan matrix for &quot;G&quot;2 can be decomposed as such:
:formula_10

The third condition is not independent but is really a consequence of the first and fourth conditions.

We can always choose a &quot;D&quot; with positive diagonal entries. In that case, if &quot;S&quot; in the above decomposition is positive definite, then &quot;A&quot; is said to be a Cartan matrix.

The Cartan matrix of a simple Lie algebra is the matrix whose elements are the scalar products

:formula_11

(sometimes called the Cartan integers) where &quot;ri&quot; are the simple roots of the algebra. The entries are integral from one of the properties of roots. The first condition follows from the definition, the second from the fact that for formula_12 is a root which is a linear combination of the simple roots &quot;ri&quot; and &quot;rj&quot; with a positive coefficient for &quot;rj&quot; and so, the coefficient for &quot;ri&quot; has to be nonnegative. The third is true because orthogonality is a symmetric relation. And lastly, let formula_13 and formula_14. Because the simple roots span a Euclidean space, S is positive definite.

Conversely, given a generalized Cartan matrix, one can recover its corresponding Lie algebra. (See Kac–Moody algebra for more details).

=== Classification ===
An formula_15 matrix &quot;A&quot; is decomposable if there exists a nonempty proper subset formula_16 such that formula_4 whenever formula_18 and formula_19. &quot;A&quot; is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.

Let &quot;A&quot; be an indecomposable generalized Cartan matrix. We say that &quot;A&quot; is of finite type if all of its principal minors are positive, that &quot;A&quot; is of affine type if its proper principal minors are positive and &quot;A&quot; has determinant 0, and that &quot;A&quot; is of indefinite type otherwise.

Finite type indecomposable matrices classify the finite dimensional simple Lie algebras (of types formula_20), while affine type indecomposable matrices classify the affine Lie algebras (say over some algebraically closed field of characteristic 0).

==== Determinants of the Cartan matrices of the simple Lie algebras ====
The determinants of the Cartan matrices of the simple Lie algebras are given in the following table (along with A1=B1=C1, B2=C2, D3=A3, D2=A1A1, E5=D5, E4=A4, and E3=A2A1).

Another property of this determinant is that it is equal to the index of the associated root system, i.e. it is equal to formula_21 where denote the weight lattice and root lattice, respectively.

== Representations of finite-dimensional algebras ==
In modular representation theory, and more generally in the theory of representations of finite-dimensional associative algebras &quot;A&quot; that are &quot;not&quot; semisimple, a Cartan matrix is defined by considering a (finite) set of principal indecomposable modules and writing composition series for them in terms of irreducible modules, yielding a matrix of integers counting the number of occurrences of an irreducible module.

== Cartan matrices in M-theory ==
In M-theory, one may consider a geometry with two-cycles which intersects with each other at a finite number of points, in the limit where the area of the two-cycles goes to zero. At this limit, there appears a local symmetry group. The matrix of intersection numbers of a basis of the two-cycles is conjectured to be the Cartan matrix of the Lie algebra of this local symmetry group.

This can be explained as follows. In M-theory one has solitons which are two-dimensional surfaces called &quot;membranes&quot; or &quot;2-branes&quot;. A 2-brane has a tension and thus tends to shrink, but it may wrap around a two-cycles which prevents it from shrinking to zero.

One may compactify one dimension which is shared by all two-cycles and their intersecting points, and then take the limit where this dimension shrinks to zero, thus getting a dimensional reduction over this dimension. Then one gets type IIA string theory as a limit of M-theory, with 2-branes wrapping a two-cycles now described by an open string stretched between D-branes. There is a U(1) local symmetry group for each D-brane, resembling the degree of freedom of moving it without changing its orientation. The limit where the two-cycles have zero area is the limit where these D-branes are on top of each other, so that one gets an enhanced local symmetry group.

Now, an open string stretched between two D-branes represents a Lie algebra generator, and the commutator of two such generator is a third one, represented by an open string which one gets by gluing together the edges of two open strings. 
The latter relation between different open strings is dependent on the way 2-branes may intersect in the original M-theory, i.e. in the intersection numbers of two-cycles. Thus the Lie algebra depends entirely on these intersection numbers. The precise relation to the Cartan matrix is because the latter describes the commutators of the simple roots, which are related to the two-cycles in the basis that is chosen.

Generators in the Cartan subalgebra are represented by open strings which are stretched between a D-brane and itself.

<text>The region of Hong Kong has been inhabited since the Old Stone Age, later becoming part of the Chinese Empire with its loose incorporation into the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). Starting out as a farming fishing village and salt production site, it became an important free port and eventually a major international financial center.

The Qing dynasty ceded Hong Kong to the British Empire in 1842 through the Treaty of Nanjing, ending the First Opium War. Hong Kong then became a British crown colony. Britain also won the Second Opium War, forcing the Qing Empire to cede Kowloon in 1860, while leasing the New Territories for 99 years from 1898.

Japan occupied Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945 during World War II. By the end of the war in 1945, Hong Kong had been liberated by joint British and Chinese troops and returned to British rule. Hong Kong greatly increased its population from refugees from mainland China, particularly during the Korean War and the Great Leap Forward. In the 1950s, Hong Kong transformed from a territory of entrepôt trade to one of industry and manufacturing. The Chinese economic reform prompted manufacturers to relocate to China, leading Hong Kong to develop its commercial and financial industry.

In 1984, the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which incited a wave of emigration from Hong Kong. The handover of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule, and it adopted the Hong Kong Basic Law.

In the 21st century, Hong Kong has continued to enjoy success as a financial centre. However, civil unrest, dissatisfaction with the government and Chinese influence, in general, has been a central issue. The planned implementation of Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 caused great controversy and a massive demonstration on 1 July 2003, causing the bill to be shelved. Citizens expressed displeasure at their electoral system, culminating in the 2014 Hong Kong protests. In 2019, the proposed Hong Kong extradition bill was seen as another step taken by the Chinese Communist Party to undermine Hong Kong&#x27;s Rule of Law, instigating a new wave of protests. In 2020, the National People&#x27;s Congress passed the Hong Kong national security law to restore stability in the territory. The new law was highly scrutinized by the pro-democracy faction and provoked further political pessimism among the city&#x27;s populace.

==Prehistoric era==
Archaeological findings suggesting human activity in Hong Kong date back over 30,000 years. Stone tools from the Old Stone Age have been excavated in Sai Kung in Wong Tei Tung. The stone tools found in Sai Kung were perhaps from a stone tool making ground from perhaps the Late Neolithic period or Early Bronze Age.

Evidence of an Upper Paleolithic settlement in Hong Kong was found at Wong Tei Tung in Sham Chung beside the Three Fathoms Cove in Sai Kung Peninsula. There were 6000 artefacts found in a slope in the area and jointly confirmed by the Hong Kong Archaeological Society and Centre for Lingnan Archaeology of Sun Yat-sen University.

The Neolithic era began approximately 7,000 years ago in Hong Kong. The settlers in this area during that time were the Che people, who also settled on the coast of southern China. Excavations were mostly found on the western shores of Hong Kong. This location was most likely chosen to avoid strong winds from the southeast and to collect food from the nearby shores. Settlement can be found in Cheung Chau, Lantau Island and Lamma Island.

The coming of the Warring States period brought an influx of Yuet people from the north into the area. They probably might have avoided the instabilities at the north and went south. Bronze fishing, combat, and ritual tools were excavated on Lantau Island and Lamma Island. Ma Wan was the earliest settlement with direct evidence in Hong Kong. The Yuet people competed and assimilated with the indigenous Che people. Hong Kong&#x27;s prehistoric period ended roughly around the duration of the Qin and Han dynasties, when the territory became part of Panyu County.

==Imperial China era (221 BC – 1841 AD)==


The territory that now comprises Hong Kong was loosely part of China during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), and the area was part of the ancient kingdom of Nam Viet (203–111 BC). During the Qin dynasty, the territory was governed by Panyu County until the time of the Jin dynasty.

Archaeological evidence indicates that the population increased during the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220). In the 1950s, the tomb at Lei Cheng Uk from the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD) was excavated and archaeologists began to investigate the possibility that salt production flourished in Hong Kong around 2000 years ago, although conclusive evidence has not been found. Tai Po Hoi, the sea of Tai Po, was a major pearl hunting harbour in China from the Han dynasty through to the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), with activities peaking during the Southern Han (917–971).

During the Jin dynasty until the early Tang dynasty, Hong Kong was governed by Bao&#x27;an County. Under the Tang dynasty, the Guangdong region flourished as an international trading centre. The Tuen Mun region in what is now Hong Kong&#x27;s New Territories served as a port, naval base, salt production centre and later as a base for the exploitation of pearls. Lantau Island was also a salt production centre, where riots by salt smugglers against the government broke out. From the middle of the Tang dynasty until the Ming dynasty, Hong Kong was governed by Dongguan County.

On 10 May 1278, Child Zhao Bing, the last Song dynasty emperor, was enthroned at Mui Wo on Lantau Island; this event is commemorated by the Sung Wong Toi memorial in Kowloon. After his defeat at the Battle of Yamen on 19 March 1279, the child emperor committed suicide by drowning with his officials at Mount Ya (modern Yamen Town in Guangdong).

During the Mongol period, Hong Kong saw its first population boom as Chinese refugees entered the area. Most of these refugees were Chinese Song dynasty loyalists fleeing the Mongol conquest of Song China.

Despite the immigration and sparse development of agriculture, the area was hilly and relatively barren. People had to rely on salt, pearl and fishery trades to produce income. Some clans built walled villages to protect themselves from the threat of bandits, rival clans and wild animals. The Qing-dynasty Chinese pirate Cheung Po Tsai became a legend in Hong Kong.

In the mid-17th century, after the Great Clearance policy which purged most of the region&#x27;s population, under the Kangxi Emperor order, many Hakka people migrated from inland China to Xin&#x27;an County, which included modern Hong Kong.

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Hong Kong remained under the governance of Xin&#x27;an County (renamed from Bao&#x27;an County), before it was colonised by the British. As a military outpost and trading port, Hong Kong&#x27;s territory gained the attention of the world.

Before the British government colonised the New Territories and New Kowloon in 1898, Punti, Hakka, Tanka and Hoklo people had migrated to and stayed in Hong Kong for many years. They are the indigenous inhabitants of Hong Kong. The Punti and Hoklo lived in the New Territories while the Tanka and Hakka lived both in the New Territories and Hong Kong Island. British reports on Hong Kong described the Tanka and Hoklo living in Hong Kong &quot;since time unknown&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopaedia Americana&quot; described Hoklo and Tanka as living in Hong Kong &quot;since prehistoric times&quot;.

When the Union Flag was raised over Possession Point on 26 January 1841, the population of Hong Kong island was about 7,450, mostly Tanka fishermen and Hakka charcoal burners living in several coastal villages. In the 1850s large numbers of Chinese would emigrate from China to Hong Kong due to the Taiping Rebellion. Other events such as floods, typhoons and famine in mainland China would also play a role in establishing Hong Kong as a place to escape the mayhem.

==Colonial Hong Kong era (1841–1930s)==


By the early 19th century, the British Empire trade was heavily dependent upon the importation of tea, silk, and porcelain from China. While the British exported to China luxury items such as clocks and watches, there remained an overwhelming imbalance in trade. China developed a strong demand for silver, which was a difficult commodity for the British to come by in large quantities. The counterbalance of trade came with exports to China of opium grown in India. By the late 19th century China grew most of the opium it used. A Chinese commissioner, Lin Zexu, voiced to Queen Victoria the Qing state&#x27;s opposition to the opium trade. The First Opium War which ensued lasted from 1839 to 1842. Britain occupied the island of Hong Kong on 25 January 1841 and used it as a military staging point. China was defeated and was forced to cede Hong Kong in the Treaty of Nanking signed on 29 August 1842. The island became a crown colony of the British Empire.

Christian missionaries founded many schools and churches in Hong Kong. St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church located in West Point was founded by the Church Mission Society in 1865. Ying Wa Girls&#x27; School located in Mid-levels was founded by the London Missionary Society in 1900. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese was founded by the London Missionary Society in 1887, and Sun Yat-sen was one of its first two graduates in 1892. The college was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong, which was established in 1911.
Along with fellow students Yeung Hok-ling, Chan Siu-bak and Yau Lit, Sun Yat-sen started to promote the thought of overthrowing the Qing empire while he studied in the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese. The four students were known by the Qing as the Four Bandits. Sun attended To Tsai Church (道濟會堂, founded by the London Missionary Society in 1888) while he studied in this college. Sun led the Chinese Revolution of 1911, which changed China from an empire to a republic.

In April 1899, the residents of Kam Tin rebelled against the colonial government. They defended themselves in Kat Hing Wai, a walled village. After several unsuccessful attacks by the British troops, the iron gate was blasted open. The gate was then shipped to London for exhibition. Under the demand of the Tang clan in 1924, the gate was eventually returned in 1925 by the 16th governor, Sir Reginald Stubbs.

The first gas company opened in 1862. In 1890 came the first electric company. For local travel rickshaws gave way to buses, ferries, and trams. Imperial Airways set up a base in 1936. Every industry went through major transformation and growth. Western-style education made advances through the efforts of Frederick Stewart. This was a crucial step in separating Hong Kong from mainland China during the political turmoil associated with the falling Qing dynasty. The base of the future financial center was formed with the opening of The Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in 1865.

The Third Pandemic of Bubonic Plague attacked Hong Kong in the 1894 Hong Kong plague. It provided the pretext for racial zoning with the creation of Peak Reservation Ordinance and recognising the importance of the first hospital.

On the outbreak of World War I in 1914, fear of a possible attack on the colony led to an exodus of 60,000 Chinese. However, Hong Kong during World War I saw no direct military action, and Hong Kong&#x27;s population continued to boom in the following decades from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925. Nonetheless, the crisis in mainland China in the 1920s and 1930s left Hong Kong vulnerable to a strategic invasion from Imperial Japan.

In 1937, Hong Kong was struck by a major typhoon.

== British lease of Kowloon and the New Territories ==

In 1860, at the end of the Second Opium War, the United Kingdom gained a perpetual lease over the Kowloon Peninsula, which is the mainland Chinese area just across the strait from Hong Kong Island. This agreement was part of the Convention of Beijing that ended that conflict.

During the second half of the 19th century, the British became increasingly wary of the Chinese-controlled islands surrounding their newly bought port. After the Second Opium War (1898, Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory) the British negotiated a lease of the &quot;New Territories&quot; in which the British would receive newer outlying islands for 99 years.

On 19 December 1984, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which Britain agreed to return not only the New Territories but also Kowloon and Hong Kong itself when the lease term expired. China promised to implement a &quot;One Country, Two Systems&quot; regime, under which for fifty years Hong Kong citizens could continue to practice capitalism and political freedoms forbidden on the mainland.

On , the lease ended, and the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong and surrounding territories to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Japanese occupation era (1940s)==
Hong Kong was occupied by Japan from 23 December 1941 to 15 August 1945. The period, called &#x27;3 years and 8 months&#x27; halted the economy. The British, Canadians, Indians and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Forces resisted the Japanese invasion commanded by Sakai Takashi which started on 8 December 1941, eight hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Japan achieved air superiority on the first day of battle and the defensive forces were outnumbered. The British and the Indians retreated from the Gin Drinker&#x27;s Line and consequently from Kowloon under heavy aerial bombardment and artillery barrage. Fierce fighting continued on Hong Kong Island; the only reservoir was lost. Canadian Winnipeg Grenadiers fought at the crucial Wong Nai Chong Gap, which was the passage between the north and the secluded southern parts of the island.

On 25 December 1941, referred to as &quot;Black Christmas&quot; by locals, British colonial officials headed by the governor of Hong Kong, Mark Aitchison Young, surrendered in person at the Japanese headquarters on the third floor of the Peninsula Hotel. Isogai Rensuke became the first Japanese governor of Hong Kong.
During the Japanese occupation, hyper-inflation and food rationing became the norm of daily lives. It became unlawful to own Hong Kong dollars, which were replaced by the Japanese military yen, a currency without reserves issued by the Imperial Japanese Army administration. During the three and half years of occupation by the Japanese, an estimated 10,000 Hong Kong civilians were executed, while many others were tortured, raped, or mutilated. Philip Snow, a prominent historian of the period, said that the Japanese cut rations for civilians to conserve food for soldiers, usually to starvation levels and deported many to famine- and disease-ridden areas of the mainland. Most of the repatriated had come to Hong Kong just a few years earlier to flee the terror of the Second Sino-Japanese War in mainland China.

By the end of the war in 1945, Hong Kong had been liberated by joint British and Chinese troops. The population of Hong Kong had shrunk to 600,000; less than half of the pre-war population of 1.6 million due to scarcity of food and emigration. The communist revolution in China in 1949 led to another population boom in Hong Kong. Thousands of refugees emigrated from mainland China to Hong Kong, and made it an important entrepôt until the United Nations ordered a trade embargo on mainland China due to the Korean War. More refugees came during the Great Leap Forward.

==Post Japanese occupation==

After the Second World War, the trend of decolonization swept across the world. Still, Britain chose to keep Hong Kong for strategic reasons. To consolidate its rule, constitutional changes, the Young Plan, were proposed in response to the trend of decolonization so as to meet the needs of the people. The political and institutional system made only minimal changes due to the political instability in mainland China at that time (aforementioned) which caused an influx of mainland residents to Hong Kong.

==Modern Hong Kong==

===Modern Hong Kong under British rule (1950s–1997)===

====1950s====
Skills and capital brought by refugees of mainland China, especially from Shanghai, along with a vast pool of cheap labour helped revive the economy. At the same time, many foreign firms relocated their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Enjoying unprecedented growth, Hong Kong transformed from a territory of entrepôt trade to one of industry and manufacturing. The early industrial centres, where many of the workers spent the majority of their days, turned out anything that could be produced with small space from buttons, artificial flowers, umbrellas, textile, enamelware, footwear to plastics.

Large squatter camps developed throughout the territory providing homes for the massive and growing number of immigrants. The camps, however, posed a fire and health hazard, leading to disasters like the Shek Kip Mei Fire. Governor Alexander Grantham responded with a &quot;multi-storey buildings&quot; plan as a standard. It was the beginning of the high-rise buildings. Conditions in public housing were very basic with several families sharing communal cooking facilities. Other aspects of life changed as traditional Cantonese opera gave way to big screen cinemas. The tourism industry began to formalise. North Point was known as &quot;Little Shanghai&quot; (小上海), since in the minds of many, it had already become the replacement for the surrendered Shanghai in China.

====1960s====
The manufacturing industry opened a new decade employing large sections of the population. The period is considered a turning point for Hong Kong&#x27;s economy. The construction business was also revamped with new detailed guidelines for the first time since World War II. While Hong Kong started out with a low GDP, it used the textile industry as the foundation to boost the economy. China&#x27;s cultural revolution put Hong Kong on a new political stage. Events like the 1967 riot filled the streets with home-made bombs and chaos. Bomb disposal experts from the police and the British military defused as many as 8,000 home-made bombs. One in every eight bombs was genuine.

Family values and Chinese tradition were challenged as people spent more time in the factories than at home. Other features of the period included water shortages, long working hours coupled with extremely low wages. The Hong Kong Flu of 1968 infected 15% of the population. Amidst all the struggle, &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot; went from a label that marked cheap low-grade products to a label that marked high-quality products. 

====1970s====

The 1970s saw the extension of government subsidised education from six years to nine years and the setup of Hong Kong&#x27;s country parks system.

The opening of the mainland Chinese market and rising salaries drove many manufacturers north. Hong Kong consolidated its position as a commercial and tourism centre in Asia. High life expectancy, literacy, per-capita income and other socio-economic measures attest to Hong Kong&#x27;s achievements over the last four decades of the 20th century. Higher income also led to the introduction of the first high-rise, private housing estates with Taikoo Shing. From this time, people&#x27;s homes became part of Hong Kong&#x27;s skyline and scenery.

In 1974, Murray McLehose founded the ICAC, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, to combat corruption within the police force. The corruption was so widespread that a mass police petition took place resisting prosecutions. Despite early opposition to the ICAC by the police force, Hong Kong was successful in its anti-corruption efforts, eventually becoming one of the least corrupt societies in the world.

The early 1970s saw legislation requiring equal pay and benefits for equal work by men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees.

====1980s====
In 1982, the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, hoped that the increasing openness of the PRC government and the economic reform in the mainland would allow the continuation of British rule. The resulting meeting led to the signing of Sino-British Joint Declaration and the proposal of the One country, two systems concept by Deng Xiaoping. But this time, Hong Kong was recognised as one of the wealthiest representatives of the far east. Political news dominated the media; while real estate took a major upswing, the financial world was rattled by panics, resulting in waves of changes in policy and Black Saturday. Warnings of the coming handover raised emigration levels to historic highs. Many left Hong Kong for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and anywhere else in the world without any communist influence.

Hong Kong&#x27;s Cinema enjoyed one paramount run that put it on the international map. Some of the biggest names included Jackie Chan and Chow Yun-fat. The music world also saw a new group of cantopop stars like Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung.

====1990 to 1997====
On 4 April 1990, the Hong Kong Basic Law was officially accepted as the mini-constitution of the Hong Kong SAR after the handover. The pro-Beijing bloc welcomed the Basic Law, calling it the most democratic legal system to ever exist in the PRC. The pro-democratic bloc criticised it as not democratic enough. In July 1992, Chris Patten was appointed as the last British governor of Hong Kong. Patten had been the chairman of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom until he lost his parliamentary seat in the general election earlier that year. Relations with the PRC government in Beijing became increasingly strained, as Patten introduced democratic reforms that increased the number of elected members in the Legislative Council. The PRC government viewed this as a breach of the Basic Law. On 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was handed over to Communist China by the United Kingdom. The old Legislative Council, elected under Chris Patten&#x27;s reforms, was replaced by the Provisional Legislative Council elected by a selection committee whose members were appointed by the PRC government. Tung Chee Hwa assumed duty as the first chief executive of Hong Kong, elected in December by a selection committee with members appointed by the PRC government. He immediately reappointed the entire team of policy secretaries, guaranteeing significant continuity.

===Chinese special administrative region (1997–ongoing)===

Chinese communists portrayed the return of Hong Kong as key moment in the PRC&#x27;s rise to great power status.

The new millennium signalled a series of events. A sizeable portion of the population that was previously against the handover found itself living with the adjustments. Article 23 became a controversy, and led to marches in different parts of Hong Kong with as many as 750,000 people out of a population of approximately 6,800,000 at the time. The government also dealt with the SARS outbreak in 2003. A further health crisis, the Bird Flu Pandemic (H5N1) gained momentum from the late 1990s, and led to the disposal of millions of chickens and other poultry. The slaughter put Hong Kong at the centre of global attention. At the same time, the economy tried to adjust fiscally. Within a short time, the political climate heated up and the chief executive position was challenged culturally, politically and managerially.

Hong Kong&#x27;s skylines have continued to evolve, with three new skyscrapers dominating, each in Kowloon, Tsuen Wan and Victoria, Hong Kong. The 88-storey Two International Finance Centre, completed in 2003, previously Hong Kong&#x27;s tallest building, has been eclipsed by the , 118-storey International Commerce Centre in West Kowloon, which was topped-out in 2010 and remains the tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong. Also worth mentioning is the Nina Tower located in Tsuen Wan. Eight additional skyscrapers over have also been completed during this time.

Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP; 讓愛與和平佔領中環 or 和平佔中) was a single-purpose Hong Kong civil disobedience campaign convened by Reverend Chu Yiu-ming, Dr Benny Tai Yiu-ting, and Chan Kin-man on 27 March 2013. Its aim was to pressure the PRC Government into reforming the systems for election of the Hong Kong chief executive and Legislative Council so as to satisfy &quot;international standards in relation to universal suffrage&quot; as promised in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and Article 45 of the 1997 Hong Kong Basic Law. Its manifesto called for occupation of the region&#x27;s central business district if such reforms were not made. Upstaged by the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) and Scholarism in September 2014, its leaders joined in the Occupy Central protests.

The number of impoverished Hongkongers hit a record high in 2016 with one in five people living below the poverty line. Along with housing issues was growing sentiment over the influence of the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese culture. The anti-Hong Kong Express Rail Link movement protested at the proposed Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link; the link was nevertheless completed in 2018. The Hong Kong 818 incident, inhibited by the visit of Li Keqiang, caused controversy regarding civil rights violations. The Moral and National Education controversy exemplified the conflict between communist and nationalist positions of China&#x27;s government with democratic sentiments expressed by Hong Kong citizens.

The 2016 Legislative Council election saw the localists emerging as a new political force behind the pro-Beijing and pan-democracy camps by winning six seats in Hong Kong&#x27;s geographical constituencies. However, six candidates were barred from contesting by the Electoral Affairs Commission, due to their association with the Hong Kong independence movement. Another six localist members who were elected were disqualified in the Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy. After the 5th Hong Kong Chief Executive election, Carrie Lam became the first female chief executive of Hong Kong. However, her proposal of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 has led to mass demonstrations against its implementation. The bill would make it legal for China to extradite criminals from Hong Kong, potentially including political prisoners. It is feared that the bill would cause the city to open itself up to the reach of mainland Chinese law and that people from Hong Kong could become subject to a different legal system.
The COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Hong Kong on 23 January 2020. Confirmed cases were generally transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital&#x27;s Infectious Disease Centre for isolation and centralised treatment. On 5 February, after a five-day strike by front-line medical workers, the Hong Kong government closed all but three border control points including Hong Kong International Airport, Shenzhen Bay Control Point, and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point remaining open.

Hong Kong was relatively unscathed by the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and had a flatter epidemic curve than most other places, which observers consider remarkable given its status as an international transport hub. Furthermore, its proximity to China and its millions of mainland visitors annually would make it vulnerable. Some experts now believe the habit of wearing masks in public since the SARS epidemic of 2003 may have helped keep its confirmed infections at 845, with four deaths, by the beginning of April. In a study published in April 2020 in the &quot;Lancet&quot;, the authors expressed their belief that border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, and behavioural changes such as wearing masks likely all played a part in the containment of the disease up to the end of March. Others attributed the success to critical thinking of citizens who have become accustomed to distrusting the competence and political motivations of the government, the World Health Organization, and the Chinese Communist Party.

After a much smaller second wave in late March and April 2020 caused by overseas returnees rushing to beat mandatory quarantine, Hong Kong saw a substantial uptick in COVID cases in July, with more than a hundred cases being reported several days in a row until early August. Experts attributed this third wave to imported cases – sea crew, aircrew members, and domestic helpers made up the majority of 3rd wave infections. In late November 2020 the city entered a fourth wave, called &quot;severe&quot; by Chief Executive Carrie Lam. The initial driver behind the fourth wave was a group of dance clubs in which wealthy, predominantly female Hong Kongers danced together and had dance lessons with mostly younger male dance instructors. Measures taken in response included a suspension of school classroom teaching until the end of the year, and an order for restaurants to seat only two persons per table and close at 10:00 p.m. taking effect on 2 December; a further tightening of restrictions saw, among other measures, a 6 pm closing time of restaurants starting from 10 December, and a mandate for authorities to order partial lockdowns in locations with multiple cases of COVID-19 until all residents were tested. From late January 2021, the government pursued repeatedly locked down residential buildings to conduct mass testing. A free mass vaccination program with the Sinovac vaccine and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was launched on 26 February. The government sought to counter the vaccine hesitancy by material incentives, which led to an acceleration of vaccinations in June.

Hong Kong was one of few countries and territories to pursue a &quot;zero-COVID&quot; elimination strategy, by essentially closing all its borders and, until February 2022, subjecting even mild and asymptomatic cases to hospitalisation, and sometimes isolation extending over several weeks. The fifth, Omicron variant driven wave of the pandemic emerging in late December 2021 caused the health system to be stretched to its limits, the mandatory hospitalization to be abandoned, and led several experts to question the zero-COVID strategy. Some even considered it counterproductive, due to it having nourished hopes that the city would eventually become free of the virus, and thus having led to a low COVID-19 vaccination rate in the city. Most of the deaths in the fifth wave were among the unvaccinated elderly.

The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress established the Hong Kong national security law which came into effect on 1 July 2020. In November 2020 the National People&#x27;s Congress authorised the dismissal of any Legco members who are perceived to ask for help from foreign countries and who &quot;refuse to recognise China&#x27;s sovereignty over Hong Kong.&quot; After multiple pro-Democracy members of Legco resigned, the Government of the United Kingdom stated that the PRC was not upholding the Sino-British treaty.

On 27 January 2021, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping said that Hong Kong could only maintain its long-term stability and security by ensuring &quot;patriots governing Hong Kong&quot; when he heard a work report delivered by Carrie Lam. On 1 March, HKMAO director Xia Baolong in the seminar of &quot;patriots governing Hong Kong&quot; stated that Hong Kong must establish a &quot;democratic electoral system with Hong Kong characteristics.&quot;

A &quot;decision on improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region&quot; was passed by the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) on 11 March 2021 to rewrite the election rules in Hong Kong to ensure a system of &quot;patriots governing Hong Kong.&quot; By amending the Annex I and Annex II of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the composition of the Legislative Council (LegCo) and the Election Committee (EC). All electoral candidates of Chief Executive, Legislative Council Member, and Election Committee Member requires prior approval from the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee.

On 23 June 2021, the pro-democracy tabloid &quot;Apple Daily&quot; announced that its final edition would be released on Thursday and that it would later cease activities after five top executives were arrested under the national security law and the tabloid&#x27;s assets were frozen. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; founder Jimmy Lai is already imprisoned and awaits trial, along with 46 others, on subversion charges. In 2021, it was announced that the library named &quot;Ocean Sea Public Library,&quot; the largest library in Asia, would open in Hong Kong.

In late 2022, it was announced that the Romer&#x27;s tree frog would be reintroduced to Hong Kong, furthermore known as rewilding. The forest on Hong Kong contains the air that is just thick with the buzzing of insects, singing of birds, chattering monkeys, and especially myriad other animals. This forest in Hong Kong is almost completely silent. That has argued that it surprises people to finally discover the considered verdant landscape being a contemporary addition in over the history, since of its started removal in industrial scale to create space for agriculture and to advance the fuel of those ceramics industry. Despite the growth, there were fewer animals to fill the emerging forests. The 200 kilometers of urban land between here and there have created an insurmountable barrier to wildlife migration. Similar to this city, mainland China has successful reintroductions of species, such as Pere David&#x27;s deer that became extinct in start of 20th century. It has been proposed that supporting the natural regeneration of forests offers a benefit, such as simplest tools in climate catastrophe. The government of Hong Kong is committed to promoting local biodiversity and helping to mitigate climate emergencies, as outlined in the Strategic Biodiversity Action Plan each time.

On November 26, 2024, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal rules against the Hong Kong Housing Authority and upholds rulings in lower courts allowing same-sex couples married overseas to avail of subsidised housing and be covered by existing inheritance laws.

<doc id="1146454" wikidata="Q5936128" url="?curid=1146454" title="Hully Gully">
<text>The Hully Gully is a type of unstructured line dance often considered to have originated in the 1960s, but is also mentioned some forty years earlier as a dance common in the black juke joints in the first part of the twentieth century. In its modern form it consisted of a series of dance steps called out by the MC. Each step was relatively simple and easy to execute; however, the challenge was to keep up with the speed of each step.

The phrase &quot;Hully Gully&quot; or &quot;Hull da Gull&quot; comes from a folk game in which a player shakes a handful of nuts or seeds and asks his opponent &quot;Hully Gully, how many?&quot;

==Modern form==
The Hully Gully was started by Frank Rocco at the Cadillac Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1959 The Olympics sang the song &quot;Hully Gully&quot;, which involved no physical contact at all. In 1961 the Olympics version of the song was popularized in the south of England by the first version of Zoot Money&#x27;s Big Roll Band and involved the audience facing the stage in lines and dancing the steps of the &quot;Southampton jive&quot;. The same tune appeared in 1961 in a song by the Marathons, entitled &quot;Peanut Butter&quot;, which was later used for the Peter Pan Peanut Butter commercial during the 1980s. Tim Morgan sang different lyrics to the song &quot;Peanut Butter&quot; as well, however, only mentioning the Skippy&quot; brand. There was another song about the dance by The Dovells, entitled &quot;Hully Gully Baby&quot;. The Jive Five had a hit called &quot;Hully Gully Callin&#x27; Time&quot;; Ike &amp; Tina Turner had a song in their repertoire known as &quot;If You Can Hully Gully (I Can Hully Gully Too)&quot;. Ed Sullivan mentioned the Cadillac Hotel as &quot;Home of the Hully Gully&quot; on his weekly show, featuring some dancers from Frank Rocco&#x27;s revue. Known as &quot;Mr. Hully Gully&quot;, Rocco then toured America (including the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair—he danced it with Goldie Hawn) and Europe, where over the next year he taught the dance at the NATO Base in Naples, Italy, in Rome, and all over Europe.

==In popular culture==
* An example of the Hully Gully can be seen performed by John Belushi in the film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;.
*In &quot;The Wanderers&quot; by Richard Price, the Hully Gully is enacted.
* Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs&#x27; 1965 hit &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; was originally called &quot;Hully Gully&quot;, but the band could not record it under that name due to the prior existence of a recorded song with that title. In addition, the speed of the beats did not fit the steps of the Hully Gully.
* The Portuguese band Conjunto Académico João Paulo had a 1965 hit with the song &quot;Hully Gully do Montanhês&quot; (English: &quot;Mountain Man&#x27;s Hully Gully&quot;)
* In a 1993 episode of the TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Gabbo, a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy, dances wildly while singing, &quot;I can do the Hully Gully!&quot;
* In a 1990 episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot; called &quot;PMS, I Love You&quot; it was described by Darlene as a dance that no child should have to witness their parents doing.
* In the Homestar Runner short &quot;Ballad of The Sneak&quot;, The Sneak is said to have done the Hully Gully on the Panama Canal.

<text>Protonium (symbol: Pn), also known as antiprotonic hydrogen, is a type of exotic atom in which a proton (symbol: p) and an antiproton (symbol: ) are bound to each other.

Since protonium is a bound system of a particle and its corresponding antiparticle, it is an example of a type of exotic atom called an &quot;onium&quot;.

Protonium has a mean lifetime of approximately 1.0 μs and a binding energy of −0.75 keV.

Like all onia, protonium is a boson with all quantum numbers (baryon number, flavour quantum numbers, etc.) and electrical charge equal to 0.

==Production==
There are two known methods to generate protonium. One method involves violent particle collisions. The other method involves putting antiprotons and protons into the same magnetic cage. The latter method was first used during the experiment ATHENA (ApparaTus for High precision Experiment on Neutral Antimatter) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva in 2002, but it was not until 2006 that scientists realized protonium was also generated during the experiment.

Reactions involving a proton and an antiproton at high energies give rise to many-particle final states. In fact, such reactions are the basis of particle colliders such as the Tevatron at Fermilab. Indirect searches for protonium at LEAR (Low Energy Antiproton Ring at CERN) have used antiprotons impinging on nuclei such as helium, with unclear results. Very low energy collisions in the range of 10 eV to 1 keV may lead to the formation of protonium.

==Studies==
Planned experiments will use traps as the source of low energy antiprotons. Such a beam would be allowed to impinge on atomic hydrogen targets, in the field of a laser, which is meant to excite the bound proton–antiproton pairs into an excited state of protonium with some efficiency (whose computation is an open theoretical problem). Unbound particles are rejected by bending them in a magnetic field. Since the protonium is uncharged, it will not be deflected by such a field. This undeflected protonium, if formed, would be allowed to traverse a meter of high vacuum, within which it is expected to decay via annihilation of the proton and antiproton. The decay products would give unmistakable signatures of the formation of protonium.

Theoretical studies of protonium have mainly used non-relativistic quantum mechanics. These give predictions for the binding energy and lifetime of the states. Computed lifetimes are in the range of 0.1 to 10 microseconds. Unlike the hydrogen atom, in which the dominant interactions are due to the Coulomb attraction of the electron and the proton, the constituents of protonium interact predominantly through the strong interaction. Thus multiparticle interactions involving mesons in intermediate states may be important. Hence the production and study of protonium would be of interest also for the understanding of internucleon forces.

<doc id="1146462" wikidata="Q1877214" url="?curid=1146462" title="Lullabies to Paralyze">
<text>Lullabies to Paralyze is the fourth studio album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age, released on March 22, 2005. The album debuted at #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and sold 97,000 copies in America during its first week of release, eventually topping over 342,000 copies as of March, 2007 according to Nielsen Soundscan. The album has been certified gold in the UK, where it has sold over 100,000 units. It is also the band&#x27;s first album to be released after bassist Nick Oliveri was fired from the band. Singer/guitarist Josh Homme and singer Mark Lanegan are the only members from the previous album, &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, to play on this album and it is the first album to feature drummer Joey Castillo and guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen.

==Background==
The album title &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; was intended to bridge &quot;Lullabies&quot; with its predecessor &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot; by naming it after a line in &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;, the final track on &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;. The &quot;deluxe limited edition&quot; of the album includes a bonus track and a bonus DVD containing &quot;a look behind the scenes and special bonus footage&quot;. Videos were produced for singles &quot;Little Sister&quot;, &quot;In My Head&quot; and &quot;Burn the Witch&quot;, and the song &quot;Someone&#x27;s in the Wolf&quot;. The video for &quot;Someone&#x27;s in the Wolf&quot; was featured on the bonus DVD of &quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot;.

The album was delayed during 2004 because of some changes to the line-up: bassist, vocalist, and co-songwriter Nick Oliveri was fired and on-off vocalist Mark Lanegan went on tour with his own band.
Lanegan can still be heard singing on several songs of the album; he also contributed lyrics. Because of this turmoil, there had been rumours that Lanegan had left the band, which Josh Homme eventually clarified in several interviews was never the case. Nevertheless, he encouraged these rumours to draw the attention off the band by giving the press &quot;something to focus on while I was just making the record&quot;.

===LP versions===
The album has three LP pressing runs. The first pressing was released by AntAcidAudio and contains a different cover to the CD version. The sides are named &quot;Once&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Were&quot; &amp; &quot;Lost&quot;, after a line from &quot;Someone&#x27;s in the Wolf&quot;, with each containing a mixture of the CD&#x27;s album and bonus tracks (with the exception of &quot;Once&quot;, only the standard tracks are present).

The second pressing is a reissue by Dutch record label Music On Vinyl, released on September 22, 2011. The reissue is different from the first pressing in that it does not have its sides named after the line from &quot;Someone&#x27;s in the Wolf,&quot; and it uses the cover art from the CD release. The reissue omitted bonus tracks &quot;Infinity&quot; and &quot;Precious and Grace&quot; from the track listing, and listed &quot;Like a Drug&quot; as the last track. Side four contains an etching of one of the album&#x27;s artwork.

The third pressing was released in November 2019 and features the tracklist from the original 2005 LP release and the cover art from the original CD release.

==Critical reception==
The album received generally positive reviews, although slightly lower than its predecessor, the average score being 78 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 31 professional reviews.

Kevin Forest Moreau awarded it 3rd best album of the year 2005, Billboard magazine ranked it 7th best album, Magnet magazine ranked it 9th, and Filter magazine considered it 10th best album of the year 2005.
JustPressPlay ranked it #31 on its list of the Top 100 Albums of the 2000s and named &quot;Tangled Up in Plaid&quot; the 19th best song of the decade.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Lullabies to Paralyze&quot; peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold in the UK on April 15, 2005 with sales exceeding 100,000 copies. It also became the band&#x27;s first album to reach the top ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at number five.

==Track listing==


=== Notes ===
* The &quot;Hidden Outro&quot; later appears as the main riff in the song &quot;Running Joke&quot;, a b-side that appears on &quot;Era Vulgaris&quot;.
* The final item on the track list, &quot;The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died&quot; (located behind the CD in the normal version, or inside the booklet in the deluxe edition), below &quot;Long Slow Goodbye&quot; reads; &quot;The Fun Machine took a shit and died – Was lost or misplaced. (There is a reward for the return of said tapes)&quot;. During that time, the band assumed that the tapes of that song were either lost or stolen. A live version of this song can be found on the DVD release &quot;Over the Years and Through the Woods&quot;. Homme commented, &quot;The tapes got lost. Actually, they were just at another studio, but we falsely accused everyone in the world of theft.&quot; The song was later rerecorded as a single and featured as a bonus track on &quot;Era Vulgaris.&quot;

<text>Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans, KG (8 May 167010 May 1726) was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England by his mistress Nell Gwyn.

==Biography==

His surname, Beauclerk (Anglo-Norman for &quot;fine scholar&quot;), had been an epithet of King Henry I. On 21 December 1676, a warrant was passed for &quot;a grant to Charles Beauclerc, the King&#x27;s natural son, and to the heirs male of his body, of the dignities of Baron of Heddington, co. Oxford, and Earl of Burford in the same county, with remainder to his brother, James Beauclerc, and the heirs male of his body.&quot; A few weeks later, James was given &quot;the title of Lord Beauclerc, with the place and precedence of the eldest son of an earl.&quot; 
Just after the death of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, at the turn of the year, on 5 January 1684, King Charles granted his son Charles, Earl of Burford, the title of Duke of St Albans, gave him an allowance of £1,000 a year, and granted him the offices of Chief Ranger of Enfield Chace and Master of the Hawks in reversion (i. e. after the death of the current incumbents). He became colonel in the 8th regiment of horse in 1687, and served with the emperor Leopold I, being present at the siege of Belgrade in 1688.

When his mother died (14 November 1687), Beauclerk received a large estate, including Burford House, near Windsor Castle. After the Battle of Landen in 1693, William III made Beauclerk captain of the gentlemen pensioners, and four years later gentleman of the bedchamber. His father had given him the reversion of the office of Hereditary Master Falconer and that of Hereditary Registrar of the Court of Chancery, which fell vacant in 1698. His Whig sentiments prevented his advancement under Queen Anne, but he was restored to favour at the accession of King George I. In 1718, George made him a Knight of the Garter.

Beauclerk died at Bath two days after his 56th birthday and is buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his eldest son.

==Marriage and issue==

On 17 April 1694 he married Lady Diana de Vere, daughter and sole heiress (as her sisters died unmarried) of Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford. She was a well-known beauty, who became lady of the bedchamber to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales. By his wife he had twelve children:

===Sons===
*Charles Beauclerk, 2nd Duke of St Albans (6 April 169627 July 1751), eldest son and heir;
*Lord William Beauclerk (22 May 169823 February 1733 N.S.)
*Admiral Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere (14 July 169921 October 1781)
*Colonel Lord Henry Beauclerk (11 August 17015 January 1761)
*Lord Sidney Beauclerk (27 February 170323 November 1744)
*Lieutenant-General Lord George Beauclerk (26 December 170411 May 1768)
*Lord Seymour Beauclerk (born 24 June 1708c. 1709)
*Rev. Lord James Beauclerk (c. 170920 October 1787); was Bishop of Hereford (1746–1787)
*Lord Aubrey Beauclerk (c. 171022 March 1741), became a captain in the Royal Navy, and died at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias.

===Daughters===
*Lady Diana Beauclerk (born c. 1697 - 1743)
*Lady Mary Beauclerk (born c. 1712)
*Lady Anne Beauclerk (born c. 1714)

==Earl of Burford==
Several legends describe how Beauclerk became Earl of Burford. The first is that on arrival of the King, his mother said, &quot;Come here, you little bastard, and greet your father.&quot; When the king rebuked her for calling him that, she replied, &quot;Your Majesty has given me no other name to call him by.&quot; In response, Charles created him Earl of Burford.

Another legend is that Beauclerk&#x27;s mother held him out of a window (or above a river) and threatened to drop him unless he was given a peerage. Charles supposedly cried out &quot;God save the Earl of Burford!&quot; and subsequently created that peerage.

<doc id="1146487" wikidata="Q2621281" url="?curid=1146487" title="Crazyhouse">
<text>Crazyhouse is a chess variant in which captured enemy pieces can be reintroduced, or &quot;dropped&quot;, into the game as one&#x27;s own. It was derived as a two-player, single-board variant of bughouse chess. Its drop rule is reminiscent of shogi and the games are often compared, though there is no known evidence suggesting that shogi provided direct inspiration for the gameplay of bughouse or crazyhouse.

== History ==
Though the four-player &quot;bughouse&quot; chess became prominent in western chess circles in the 1960s, the crazyhouse variant did not rise to prominence until the era of 1990s online chess servers, though it may be traced back further to the &quot;Mad Mate&quot; variant made in 1972 by Alex Randolph, a Bohemian-American game designer who moved to Japan and became an amateur dan-level Shogi player.

== Rules ==
The rules of chess apply except for the addition of drops, as explained below.
* A piece that is captured reverses color and goes to the capturing player&#x27;s reserve, pocket or bank, where it is considered held or in hand. On any turn, instead of making a move with a piece on the board, a player can drop one of their held pieces onto an empty square on the board.
* A pawn may not be dropped on the 1st or 8th .
* A pawn that is dropped on its 2nd rank may use its two-square initial advance; a pawn that is dropped on any other rank cannot.
* When a piece that is promoted from a pawn is captured, it enters the opponent&#x27;s reserve as a pawn.
Unlike in shogi, dropping a pawn on a containing another pawn of the same color and dropping a pawn to deliver checkmate are both permissible.

== Notation ==
Crazyhouse&#x27;s notation system is an extension of the standard algebraic notation. A drop is notated like a standard move, except an at sign is placed immediately before the destination square. For example, N@d5 means &quot;knight is dropped on d5.&quot;

== FEN ==
There is no standard FEN specification for Crazyhouse. Lichess uses an extended version of FEN, adding a 9th rank as a reserve. Here is an example of Lichess&#x27;s FEN implementation:
In XBoard/Winboard&#x27;s notation system, the reserve is given in square brackets following the board position:
In Chess.com&#x27;s notation system, the reserve is located after the full-move number.

To keep track of which pieces are promoted, Lichess and XBoard/Winboard use &quot;~&quot; after the letter designation. Chess.com uses the coordinates of the pieces.
== Criticisms ==
GM Larry Kaufman wrote: &quot;[Crazyhouse] is rather fun and interesting, but the games tend to be short, and it is almost certain that White has a forced win, although it would probably be too difficult to prove this and certainly too difficult to memorize all the possible variations.&quot;

<text>The Jersey Skiff is a boat that was once popular for sport fishing in the United States. They were introduced by fishermen on the Jersey Shore, and were originally designed to be launched from the beach through the surf, so they could tend their fishing nets offshore.

They first appeared around the end of the 19th century. There were two distinct versions, along the Northern Jersey Shore, The Sea Bright, and the Southern Shore, Jersey Skiff. In the early 20th century Jersey Skiffs were employed by early coast guardsmen and lifeguards. The boats had evolved into wreckage and salvage work as well as fishing uses. The primary difference between the two boats is the addition of a board on the side of the Jersey Skiff for slightly greater freeboard. Also the hull is slightly narrower for better rowing. And the transom of Jersey Skiff is more of a wine glass shape which integrates into the skeg, whereas The Sea Bright transom does not. The skeg can be added as an additional board.

The design characteristics of the boat, are a stem that is slightly raked, less than a Dory and more than a Whitehall Rowboat. The stern was in a heart or wine glass shape with a rake toward the center of the boat. This allows the boat to be retrieved through the surf bow first. Although it is reported that in rougher conditions the boat is beached stern first. The boats are of fairly shallow draft and have a narrow flat bottom which is useful for sitting on the beach. Although the sides are generally rounded, without a keel but with a small skeg for tracking.

The boats were generally outfitted with a sprit or lug sailing rig and a small jib. The mast was generally unstayed. Early fisherman used an oar to steer with rather than bring a separate rudder. Modern sailing versions come with a separate rudder. But an oarlock can be mounted on the transom for use with an oar as a steering device.

The first trans Atlantic passage by a rowboat was made by George Herbo and Frank Samuelson on an 18 foot Jersey skiff (named Fox) in June 6, 1896. The voyage left from New York and arrived in England on July 31, 1896. 

==Prohibition==
The boat during prohibition was modified into a speedboat but there are still some builders making traditional boats in fiberglass.

With the start of Prohibition Captain William McCoy began to bring rum from Bimini and the Bahamas into south Florida through Government Cut. The Coast Guard soon caught up with him, so they began to bring the illegal goods to just outside the U.S. territorial waters and let smaller boats and other captains such as Habana Joe take the risk of bringing it into shore. By far the biggest Rum Row was in the New York/Philadelphia area off the New Jersey coast, where as many as 60 ships were seen at one time. One of the most notable New Jersey rum runners was Habana Joe, who could be seen at night running into remote areas in Raritan Bay with his flat-bottom skiff for running up on the beach, making his delivery, and speeding away.

<text>The North Carolina State Fair is an American state fair and agricultural exposition held annually in Raleigh, North Carolina. Founded in 1853, the fair is organized by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. It attracts around a million visitors over eleven days in mid-October.

The fair consists of carnival rides, agricultural exhibitions and competitions, food, music, demonstrations, and garden and craft displays. The North Carolina State Fair is one of the largest and oldest state fairs in the United States. 

Security guards, the Raleigh Police, the Wake County Sheriff&#x27;s Office &amp; North Carolina State Highway Patrol are the fair&#x27;s patrollers.

==History==

The North Carolina State Agricultural Society organized the first North Carolina State Fair in 1853 at a site east of Raleigh. This organization included some of the most influential men in North Carolina. In addition to promoting North Carolina&#x27;s farmers and agricultural produce, the Agricultural Society also wanted to create an event to &quot;attract and encourage interaction among people from all sections of the state.&quot; In this era, the fair included horse races, political oration, marching bands, and military units on parade.

In 1855, the State issued $1,500 a year to the Agricultural Society for the fair&#x27;s operating expenses. Thomas Ruffin, president of the society, managed the fair from 1853 to 1859. It ceased operations from 1861 to 1868 during the Civil War and Reconstruction.

The fair reopened in 1869 under the leadership of Kemp P. Battle. In 1873, the fair moved to a new location west of Raleigh on Hillsborough Street. The City of Raleigh helped acquire the site near the North Carolina Railroad. In the 1870s and 1880s, the mills in Winston-Salem would close so workers could attend the state fair in Raleigh. By the start of the 20th century, the fair featured a midway with various attractions, human and animal freak shows, hoochie coochie shows, car and horse races, and thrill shows. The fair promoted agricultural reforms, new technologies, and scientific methods to the state&#x27;s farmers. In 1900, the fair&#x27;s attendance was 50,000.

In 1917, a Woman&#x27;s Building was added to the fairgrounds to recognize the contributions of North Carolina&#x27;s women during World War I. Its dedication included an invocation by Sallie Cotton who founded the North Carolina Woman&#x27;s Clubs. Other women spoke, including Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to the United States Congress.

Katherine Smith Reynolds because the first female executive committee member of the North Carolina State Agricultural Society, serving from 1918 to 1921. Edith Vanderbilt was the society&#x27;s president from 1921 to 1924, serving as de fact fair chair and presiding over six men such as Josephus Daniels. Although adding women to the fair&#x27;s board was progressive, it was also practical. Reynolds and Vanderbilt were two of the wealthiest individuals in the state. At the time, the cost of hosting the fair was increasing, and managing the mix of educational exhibits and commercial spectacles was expanding beyond the reach of a volunteer board. Vanderbilt got the fair back on a sound financial footing, &quot;accomplishing what any number of men have failed to do.&quot;

Following her success, Vanderbilt pressed the state for more financial support, speaking to the legislature from its floor. In return, she promised new buildings, better exhibits, and more attendees. One journalist wrote, &quot;Mrs. Vanderbilt has given time, energy, and contagious enthusiasm, and men have found pleasure in helping her see her ambitions for North Carolina realized.&quot;

Without Vanderbilt at its helm for 1925, the fair returned to shaky finances complicated by a site that was too small. The North Carolina State Agricultural Society did not hold the fair in 1926. When the society disbanded, the State took over the fair. In 1927, the North Carolina Legislature designated for new fairgrounds at the Blue Ridge Road and Hillsborough Street intersection on the west side of Raleigh. This site is still used for the North Carolina State Fair but has expanded to .

There was no fair in 1927 while the State developed the new fairgrounds. Wake Country contributed funds for new fairgrounds buildings, supplementing the proceeds from selling the former Agricultural Society&#x27;s property. The fair returned in 1928 with record crowds. New structures include livestock barns and commercial and educational buildings.

The State assigned the fair&#x27;s operation to the State Board of Agriculture in 1930. That year, circus promoter George A. Hamid Sr. secured a lease to operate the fair. Hamid owned Atlantic City&#x27;s Million Dollar Pier and a circus. Under his leadership, the fair&#x27;s grandstand featured circus-type acts, a trend that continued through the 1960s. The fair was also a popular oratory stop for presidential candidates, including William Jennings Bryan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and President Theodore Roosevelt.

Hamid ran the fair until 1937, when W. Kerr Scott, the new state commissioner of agriculture, convinced the legislature to make the fair a division of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. When Kerr ran for office, part of his platform was to return the fair to state oversight. Since 1937, the fair is part of the Department of Agriculture, now the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

The fair ceased operations between 1942 and 1945 because of World War II. Beginning in 1948, the fair contracted with the James E. Strates Shows to provide the midway rides and shows. The fair continued to be a popular stop for presidents seeking reelection, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush.

Today, the fair is self-supporting and does not receive state funding. Its profits are reinvested in the fairgrounds. In 2010, the fair broke an attendance record with 1,091,887 visitors.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the State canceled the 2020 fair. It resumed in 2021.
== Buildings ==
The fairground&#x27;s most significant structure is J. S. Dorton Arena, a 7,500-seat stadium designed by architects Matthew Nowicki and William Henry Deitrick in 1949. Completed in 1953 as a livestock-judging pavilion, it features a large suspended roof and was the first indoor arena designed without any columns, becoming a model for future superdome structures. Opening for the centennial of the fair&#x27;s founding, Dorton Arena &quot;became the symbol of the modern fair.&quot; In 1957, the American Institute of Architects selected it as one of ten 20th-century buildings that would shape American architecture. Dorton Arena was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and is a Raleigh Historic Landmark and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

The North Carolina State Commercial &amp; Education Buildings are the fairgrounds&#x27; oldest permanent buildings. Built in 1928, this pair of rectangular exhibition halls are Spanish Mission Revival style or Mediterranean Revival style buildings. Atwood and Weeks, an architectural firm from Durham, designed the stucco-covered buildings. The twin buildings appear as a single structure because of their unified façade with tower-flanked entrances and glazed terra cotta ornamentation. Together, this building complex is in length and in depth. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 and is a Raleigh Historic Landmark.

The Jim Graham Building, the Governor James E. Holshouser Building, and the Governor W. Kerr Scott Building became part of the fairgrounds in the 1970s. Newer additions include the Agri-Supply Exposition Center, the Sam G. Rand Grandstand (formerly the State Fairgrounds Speedway), the Governor James B. Hunt Jr. Horse Complex, and the new James Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Stanfield Natural Resources Center. The fairgrounds also contain the Pitzer Heritage Circle and the Heritage Tobacco Pavilion.

==Exhibits==
The fair includes many exhibits, including the Antique Farm Machinery exhibit, the Flower and Garden Show, the North Carolina Forest Service and North Carolina Soil and Water Conservation exhibit, and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission exhibit. The Field of Dreams is a mini-farm where children can see how food is grown, taste produce, and watch a rabbit race. Got to Be NC Agriculture features cooking demonstrations, pop-up cooking contests, and free food samples.

The Heritage Circle consists of historic buildings, blacksmith and gristmill demonstrations, and samples of apple cider and hush puppies. The Village of Yesteryear features artists and crafters creating, displaying, and selling handmade crafts. The State Fair Ark has more than fifty animals on display, including cattle, goats, sheep, and swine.

== Competitions ==
The state fair provides ample opportunities for North Carolinians to enter competitions, with some 36,000 entries in 2021. The fair awards prizes for artwork, cake decorating, canned food, floral arrangements, cut flowers, garden design, handicrafts, home furnishings, quilting, shoe decorating, and terrarium building. In addition, judges review honey, produce, livestock, poultry, and rabbits. There is also a Heritage Tobacco Harvest Competition.

Newer competitive categories include Christmas tree decorations, graphic design, and robotics. There is also a Home Chef Challenge and competitions for apprentices in carpentry, cosmetology, electrical, HVAC, masonry, and plumbing. Winners receive cash prizes.

The North Carolina State Fair Horse Show and Hunter Jumper Show takes place before, during, and after the fair at the Governor James B. Hunt Horse Complex.

The Folk Festival was first held at the fair in 1948 to showcase North Carolina&#x27;s traditional music and dance. More than 1,500 people participate yearly for the coveted Bascom Lamar Lunsford Trophy, named after the festival&#x27;s founder.

== Entertainment ==

=== Carnival rides ===
In 2004, Powers Great American Midways, based out of Burgaw, North Carolina, won the midway contract for the fair. Powers Great American Midways and Wade Shows provide more than 100 rides, carnival games, and concessions on the midway. One of the rides is the SkyGazer, the largest traveling Ferris wheel in the United States; it seats 200 people and is tall.

=== Live Music ===
Traditionally, Dorton Arena has nightly concerts, showcasing country, rock, and R&amp;B music. Past acts include American Aquarium, Clay Aiken, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Dillon Fence, Florida Georgia Line, Hot Chelle Rae, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Kansas, Chris Lane, Kimberly Locke, Toby Mac, Pure Prairie League, Sister Hazel, Skillet, and Superchunk. For 2022, the fair decided to use Dorton Arena for non-music events.

The Homegrown Music Festival features more than 100 concerts by local musical acts on two stages throughout the day.

=== Shows and events ===
The Sam Rand Grandstand hosts special events, including the Tractor Pull, the Demolition Derby, the Canine Stars, and the King Action Sports Stunt Show. Other popular acts include the Paul Bunyan Lumberjack Show, racing pigs at Hogway Speedway, and various roaming acts. The Kiddieland Fun Park caters to children with stage shows and attractions. There are also nightly fireworks displays.

=== The State Fair Flyer ===
Introduced in 2016, the State Fair Flyer is a high sky chairlift ride with 126 seats that hang from a cable stretching more than across the fairgrounds. The ride moves and lasts ten minutes. American Sky Lifts, based in Sanford, owns and built the massive machine for one million dollars. The fair has a ten-year lease for the lift with an option for a ten-year renewal.

== Amtrak station ==

During the fair, NC By Train establishes a temporary train station adjoining the fair grounds, which is served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Carolinian&quot; and &quot;Piedmont&quot;.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On October 24, 2013, five people received injuries when the Vortex ride restarted as they exited the ride, operated by Powers Great American Midways. The injured ranged in age between 14 and 39 and were all hospitalized—some with serious injuries. On October 29, 2013, the operator of the ride, Timothy Dwayne Tutterow, was charged with three felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon for inflicting serious bodily injury in connection with the accident. In June 2015, Tutterow pled guilty but was not sentenced as part of a plea arrangement to testify against the ride owner, Joshua Gene Macaroni. On February 19, 2016, Macaroni served thirty days in jail.

<text>The King&#x27;s School, Rochester, is a private co-educational all through day and boarding school in Rochester, Kent. It is a cathedral school and, being part of the foundation of Rochester Cathedral. The school claims to be the second oldest continuously operating school in the world, having been founded in 604 AD.
 It is the oldest choir school in the world.

==History==
The cathedral school in Rochester was founded in 604 AD, at the same time as the cathedral. It was refounded by Henry VIII in 1541 during the English Reformation when the monastery in Rochester was dissolved. It is the second oldest school in the United Kingdom after The King&#x27;s School Canterbury.

== Leadership ==
The current principal is Ben Charles, who also acts as the senior school headmaster. Kellie Crozer is the headmistress of the Pre-Preparatory and Preparatory Schools.

==Site==
The school is housed in a variety of buildings around Rochester (the school also uses Rochester Cathedral for school services).

=== Senior school===
==== Satis House ====

A 16th-century town house rebuilt as an 18th-century Georgian house, the school took it over in 1950 and purchased it outright in 1968. It had originally been built for Richard Watts who had entertained Queen Elizabeth I there in 1573: asked for her verdict on her stay, the Queen had answered, &quot;satis&quot; (from the Latin &quot;&quot; for &quot;enough&quot;), hence the name of the house. Above the entrance portico is a 1578 bust of Watts who represented Rochester in Parliament between 1563 and 1571. At Satis House are the office of the principal of King&#x27;s Rochester, administrative offices and the Sixth Form Centre.

==== |HC| ====

The oldest building in use which was specifically built for the school. It was completed in 1742, the tower and additional classrooms were added in 1880 and the building extended with porches either end in 1913. During WW2 the building was commandeered for ARP purposes. The wooden roof which had served as the school&#x27;s assembly hall was removed in 1976. In 1985, it became the Design and Technology Centre. At the entrance are the Parker Memorial Gates (after the Reverend William Parker, headmaster 1913–35) which were dedicated in 1955.

==== Cheetham Memorial Building ====

This was opened in 1909 by Richard Glazebrook, director of the National Physical Laboratory. It originally consisted of a science laboratory and an art room and now contains two computing suites. The Venerable Samuel Cheetham was Archdeacon of Rochester from 1882 until his death in 1908.

==== Laboratory and lecture theatre ====

Bachelor&#x27;s Masonry

==== Mackean House ====

This was built in 1840 and later named after the last canon of the cathedral to live there, Canon William Herbert Mackean (1877–1960), Canon of Rochester 1925–58. The headmaster&#x27;s study and the senior school were housed there until both were relocated Satis House in 1986. The property is marked on early maps as the house of the second prebend. During World War 2 the house was used for ARP purposes and is now used by the senior school English, geography, PE, economics and business studies departments.

==== Davies Court ====

Opened in 1982 by the Archbishop of York and named after Ernest William Davies (headmaster 1935–57), it houses the school&#x27;s art, religious studies and language centres (French, Spanish, German and Russian). Memorial gates at the entrance from the Vines were dedicated in 2006.

==== Old St Margaret&#x27;s ====

Originally a Richard Watts charitable school (as per the plaque on the façade explains), this is the oldest building in the towns of the Lower Medway in continuous educational use. As a Church of England primary school, St Margaret&#x27;s, it was taken over by King&#x27;s School in 1960 and purchased outright in 1968. It is used by the senior school mathematics, history and classics departments. Parts of the building and outbuildings house the offices of the school&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force which celebrated its centenary in 2011.

==== School hall ====

This was opened and dedicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1967. It is regularly used to host school productions, assemblies and other events.

==== Bob Doubles ====

Named after a method of change ringing on five bells. This is the school&#x27;s café and tuck shop and has recently been moved to the Prep School.

The former building is now the Senior School Library.

==== King&#x27;s Rochester Sports Centre ====

A joint venture with Medway Council, the King&#x27;s Rochester Sports Centre was officially opened in June 2014 and provides among its modern facilities, netball and tennis courts and a gymnasium which are also available to the general public. The school also has a &quot;ẞondarchuk&quot; by Allington Lock near Aylesford on the River Medway which opened in 1984. The school has a long rowing tradition with the King&#x27;s School Rochester Boat Club being founded in 1961.

===Preparatory School===
Source:

The main building was opened in 1958, extended in 1984 and with a new wing added in 1992. The part of King&#x27;s Rochester was called the Junior School until 1989.

St Nicholas House

The late Victorian former vicarage for St Nicholas Church, was purchased in 1946 and used as the Junior School until the new buildings were opened in 1958. From 1958 until 1974 it was a boarding house and now contains Preparatory School administrative offices. Adjacent to St Nicholas House was a wartime decontamination shelter which had been converted to Junior School changing rooms. An additional floor and gabled roof were added in 2000 and opened that year in memory of David Dann (King&#x27;s Scholar 1942–52) and a Governor of the school, to provide additional music facilities.

Rookwood

Previously used as a Junior School boarding house, as the first site of the Pre-Preparatory School (opened in 1988) and for the Nursery School and is now used for extra support lessons. From 1946 to 1961 it was the Headmaster&#x27;s house.

St Ronan&#x27;s

Built in 1908, acquired in 1948 and now used as a supplementary boarding house until boarding capacity at School House was increased in 1972 and now houses the Music Department.

The Pavilion

Situated above a bank on the west side of the paddock. The original building was created in 1905. An extension to the north, later called the Colours Room, was added in 1920 in memory of Major Maurice Miskin (1903–10), who was killed in action in 1918. The 25m Rifle Range immediately to the south and used by the Combined Cadet Force was built in 1926.

Conference Centre

Opened in 2006, the Conference Centre consists of a small hall on the ground floor and a basement used as a dining hall for the Preparatory and Pre-Preparatory Schools.

===Pre-Preparatory School===
Chadlington House

King&#x27;s Rochester Pre-Preparatory School was opened in 2000 and named Chadlington House after Old Roffensian life peer Peter Gummer (Lord Chadlington). This modern building also now houses King&#x27;s Nursery School. In 2017 &#x27;Armadilla Pods&#x27; were constructed in the grounds for music lessons.

<doc id="1146518" wikidata="Q6979152" url="?curid=1146518" title="National Union of Railwaymen">
<text>The National Union of Railwaymen was a trade union of railway workers in the United Kingdom. The largest railway workers&#x27; union in the country, it was influential in the national trade union movement.

==History==

The NUR was an industrial union founded in 1913 by the merger of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (founded 1872), the United Pointsmen and Signalmen&#x27;s Society (founded 1880) and the General Railway Workers&#x27; Union (founded 1889).

The NUR represented the majority of railway workers, but not white-collar workers, who were members of the Railway Clerks&#x27; Association (founded 1897, later the Transport Salaried Staffs&#x27; Association). NUR membership was open to drivers and firemen but most chose instead to be members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (founded 1880).

In 1914 the NUR joined forces with the National Transport Workers&#x27; Federation and Mining Federation of Great Britain to form the Triple Alliance – perhaps an unfortunate name, as the same year the Triple Entente of Britain, France and Russia and the Triple Alliance of Germany, and Austria-Hungary (albeit without Italy) went to war.

In 1919 the NUR and ASLEF jointly organised the 1919 United Kingdom railway strike, which prevented a proposed wage reduction and won an eight-hour maximum working day. The NUR formed Federation agreements with ASLEF in 1903 and 1982 but both were short-lived.

The NUR had 408,900 members in 1945, making it the fifth largest union in Britain. Its membership fell to 369,400 in 1956 and 227,800 in 1966.

Following the formation of British Rail, the majority of NUR members worked for the nationalised organisation. However, other members worked for London Transport, the National Freight Corporation and various smaller companies. It also recruited British Rail workers in associated industries, such as its hotels, docks and harbours, and on the Sealink ferries.

In 1990 the NUR merged with the National Union of Seamen to form the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and ceased to exist as a separate union.

==Election results==
The union sponsored numerous Labour Party Parliamentary candidates, many of whom won election.

<text>The Sea Bright Skiff is a box-skegged skiff developed on the northern shore of New Jersey. It was used for fishing, by being launched through the surf, sailed to the fishing grounds, and returned through the surf.

==Description==
The boat is quite different from the Jersey Skiff, being more round-sided, with less freeboard, and the distinct &quot;box skeg&quot; that proved particularly useful when engines were adopted. The boat has a nearly straight stem, rounded sides, a narrow flat bottom that becomes the bottom of the skeg, and a heart shaped transom. The boat was usually rigged with a spritsail mainsail and small jib with an unstayed mast. The early fishing versions used an oar as the rudder, more modern versions, however, have a regular rudder &amp; tiller.

The larger pound boat, built to the same lines, was generally around 30 feet, but could run to 50 feet in length, 10 foot beam. It was used to carry to shore fish caught in offshore weirs. Like sardine carriers and oyster buy-boats, it was heavily laden on return, with very little freeboard.

This boat has nearly disappeared from the shores of New Jersey except as used by lifeguards (rowing configuration only).

A short video on the skiff can be found here.

<doc id="1146553" wikidata="Q2561118" url="?curid=1146553" title="Cross of Valour (Poland)">
<text>The Cross of Valour () is a Polish military decoration. It was introduced by the Council of National Defense on 11 August 1920. It is awarded to an individual who &quot;has demonstrated deeds of valour and courage on the field of battle.&quot; It may be awarded to the same person up to four times. The medal is given only in wartime or shortly after.

==History==
===Polish-Soviet War===
The medal was introduced in 1920 at the height of the Polish-Soviet War, shortly before the climactic Battle of Warsaw. Initially it had no Order Council and was awarded personally by the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army. Later the option was added of delegating the medal&#x27;s granting to front and division commanders.

Through 29 May 1923, when the last medal for the Polish-Soviet War was awarded, the Cross of Valour had been granted to some 60,000 soldiers.

Apart from individuals who had participated in the Polish-Soviet War, the medal had also been awarded retroactively to some soldiers of the Polish Legions, of World War I military units, of the Silesian Uprisings, of the Great Poland Uprising, and to members of the Polish Military Organization. It had been awarded, as well, to veterans of the January 1863 Uprising and to the city of Płock.

===World War II===
In January 1940 the Polish Commander-in-Chief, Władysław Sikorski, issued an order reintroducing the Cross of Valour. On 20 September, the President of Poland agreed to award the medal to eligible individuals who had already been awarded it four times during the Polish-Soviet War.

===People&#x27;s Republic of Poland===
In 1943, after the Battle of Lenino, General Zygmunt Berling, commander of the Soviet-backed Polish 1st Corps, awarded the Cross of Valour to several soldiers. The medal itself was approved as a military decoration by order of the communist-led State National Council on 22 December 1944. Up to 1947, some 40,000 of the medals were awarded to Polish soldiers fighting alongside the Red Army.

<doc id="1146555" wikidata="Q5599199" url="?curid=1146555" title="Great Float">
<text>The Great Float is a body of water on the Wirral Peninsula, England, formed from the natural tidal inlet, the Wallasey Pool. It is split into two large docks, East Float and West Float, both part of the Birkenhead Docks complex. The docks run approximately inland from the River Mersey, dividing the towns of Birkenhead and Wallasey. The Great Float consists of of water and more than of quays.

==History==

Unlike in Liverpool, where the docks were built along the coastline of the River Mersey, Birkenhead Docks were designed as an inland system by enclosing the tidal inlet of Wallasey Pool. The construction of a cofferdam enabled land reclamation and excavations to take place. After the establishment of the Great Low Water Basin, Morpeth Dock and Egerton Dock, the Great Float was formed between 1851 and 1860 from most of what remained of Wallasey Pool. The plans for its construction were originally shown in 1844 in the &quot;Liverpool Standard&quot; newspaper. Designed by James Meadows Rendel, protégé of Thomas Telford, the scheme was managed by the Birkenhead Dock Company until a financial crisis in 1847. The docks were taken over by the Liverpool Corporation in 1855. By 1858, the rights to dock ownership and revenues were transferred to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, based in Liverpool.

Graving docks were built in 1864 and 1877, on the south side of West Float. Established in 1853, Thomas Brassey&#x27;s Canada Works was built to the east of the Great Float. The entrance to the Great Float was originally through the Great Low Water Basin, which was enclosed in 1877 as Wallasey Dock. After this date, access from the river was provided via Alfred Dock and Morpeth Dock.

The &quot;Resurgam&quot;, one of the first submarines, was tested in the Great Float in 1879.

In the early 20th-century, Birkenhead Docks became an important flour milling centre, with numerous companies, including Joseph Rank Ltd and Spillers, located on the Great Float&#x27;s quaysides. In the 1990s, long after the industry had gone into decline, most of these buildings were demolished. Two large warehouses remain, which have now been converted into residential apartments.

The Great Float was the site of the Warship Preservation Trust&#x27;s exhibits from 2002 until its closure in February 2006.

LCT 7074 &quot;Landfall&quot; is the last remaining tank landing craft which had served during D-Day. The landing craft was one of the Warship Preservation Trust exhibits and had sunk in East Float following the liquidation of the trust in 2006. The craft was refloated on 16 October 2014.

==Docks==

The following docks were originally accessible from the Great Float:

In addition, three graving docks existed in the Great Float for ship repairs. Bidston No.3 Dock remains in use as part of the facilities of Cammell Laird Shiprepairers and Shipbuilders Ltd. The other graving docks were filled in during the 1980s.

==Quays==

===East Float===

===West Float===

==Bridges==
=== Four Bridges ===
Historically, four movable bridges existed along the A554 Tower Road connecting the Seacombe district of Wallasey with Birkenhead: two between the Great Float and Alfred Dock, one between the Great Float and Wallasey Dock and one between the Great Float and Egerton Dock. When originally built, all four were hydraulic swing bridge types. In the 1930s, most were replaced by bascule bridges.

Only two bridges remain, but they remain known collectively as &quot;Four Bridges&quot;: a northern red girdered bascule bridge, known as the &quot;A&quot; bridge, and a southern bridge, known as the &quot;C&quot; bridge, which was replaced with a modern flat-deck fixed concrete slab in 2017. Renovation work in the same year also replaced the &quot;A&quot; bridge with a lifting bridge powered by hydraulic rams. Work was expected to be completed by November 2017 but, due to complications, the bridge was not reopened until 28 June 2018.

=== Duke Street Bridge ===
Joining the southern end of the Poulton district of Wallasey with the north end of Birkenhead, Duke Street bridge is also a bascule bridge but with painted green girders. Originally, it was a swing bridge.

=== Penny Bridge ===
Furthest upstream is the Penny Bridge, on Wallasey Bridge Road, which crosses the head of the pool to connect Poulton with Bidston in Birkenhead. Replacing an earlier wooden bridge of 1843, the name derives from the 1896 one penny toll to cross in one direction. The bridge was replaced again in 1926 and provided access to Bidston Dock. The bridge was replaced by a new swing bridge in 1996 but since the dock itself has been filled in the mechanism has fallen into disrepair through lack of use and the bridge is now effectively a static structure.

==Central Hydraulic Tower and Engine House==

Jesse Hartley, who was responsible for many of Liverpool&#x27;s maritime structures – including the Albert Dock, designed the Central Hydraulic Tower and Engine House (the tower is an accumulator tower). Providing power for the movement of lock gates and bridges at Birkenhead Docks, it was completed in 1863. The design of the building was based on the Palazzo Vecchio in the Piazza Della Signoria, Florence, Italy. In March 2021, it was announced that the building would be brought back in to use as a Maritime Knowledge Hub and will be a national base for marine engineering research and development and survival training as well as providing business accelerator space for the maritime sector. The project will cost £23m.

==Wirral Waters==
Peel Holdings announced on 6 September 2006 the Wirral Waters project. This would allow for a £4.5bn of investment in the regeneration of the dockland area. This equates with an investment of over £14,000 for each of the 320,000 population of Wirral. At the East Float and Vittoria Dock, the development would include several 50-storey skyscrapers, of new office space and for new residential apartments. A retail and leisure quarter at the former Bidston Dock site would encompass another of space. The whole project is estimated to create over 27,000 permanent new jobs, aside from the employment required for construction and other peripheral employment.

The Wirral Waters Baseline Study of July 2008 has been endorsed by Wirral Borough Council. In February 2009 the first stage of the planning application for the first major mixed use development masterplan/quarter was submitted. The development would be expected to take up to 30 years. The scheme is included in the Wirral Local Plan 2020–2035.
