<text>CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker on his 1802 microprocessor. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800, which were 8-bit microcomputers made in the mid-1970s.

CHIP-8 was designed to be easy to program for, as well as using less memory than, other programming languages like BASIC. 

Interpreters have been made for many devices, such as home computers, microcomputers, graphing calculators, mobile phones, and video game consoles. 

==Community==
CHIP-8 has been used on a wide range of devices over time; the first community to use CHIP-8 started in the 1970s on microcomputers. They shared extensions and programs in newsletters such as ARESCO&#x27;s VIPER for COSMAC VIP users or DREAMER for DREAM 6800 users. In the VIPER newsletter, the first three issues detailed the machine code for the CHIP-8 interpreter for the VIP. 

In the 1990s, CHIP-8 interpreters started to be created for graphing calculators. Notable examples include CHIP-48 and SCHIP for the HP-48. 

CHIP-8 applications include original games, demos, as well as recreations of popular games from other systems. With some CHIP-8 applications being in the public domain, using licenses like the Creative Commons Zero license. 

==CHIP-8 extensions and variations==

During the 1970s and 1980s, CHIP-8 users shared CHIP-8 programs, but also changes and extensions to the CHIP-8 interpreter, like in the VIPER magazine for COSMAC VIP. These extensions included CHIP-10 and Hi-Res CHIP-8, which introduced a higher resolution than the standard 64x32, and CHIP-8C and CHIP-8X, which extended the monochrome display capabilities to support limited color, among other features. These extensions were mostly backwards compatible, as they were based on the original interpreter, although some repurposed rarely used opcodes for new instructions. 

In 1979, Electronics Australia ran a series of articles on building a kit computer similar to the COSMAC VIP, based on the Motorola 6800 architecture. This computer, the DREAM 6800, came with its own version of CHIP-8. A newsletter similar to VIPER, called DREAMER, was used to share CHIP-8 games for this interpreter. In 1981, Electronics Today International (ETI) ran a series of articles on building a computer, the ETI-660, which was also very similar to the VIP (and used the same microprocessor). ETI ran regular ETI-660 and general CHIP-8 columns until 1985.

In 1990, a CHIP-8 interpreter called CHIP-48 was made by Andreas Gustafsson for HP-48 graphing calculators. Erik Bryntse later created another interpreter based on CHIP-48, titled &quot;SUPER-CHIP&quot;,  often shortened to SCHIP or S-CHIP. SCHIP extended the CHIP-8 language with a larger resolution and several additional opcodes meant to make programming easier. 

David Winter&#x27;s interpreter, disassembler, and extended technical documentation popularized CHIP-8/SCHIP on other platforms. It laid out a complete list of undocumented opcodes and features and was distributed across hobbyist forums. Many interpreters used these works as a starting point.

However, CHIP-48 subtly changed the semantics of a few of the opcodes, and SCHIP continued to use those new semantics in addition to changing other opcodes. Many online resources about CHIP-8 propagate these new semantics, so many modern CHIP-8 games are not backwards compatible with the original CHIP-8 interpreter for the COSMAC VIP, even if they do not specifically use the new SCHIP extensions. 

Some extensions take opcodes or behavior from multiple extensions, like XO-CHIP which takes some from behavior from SCHIP and CHIP-8E. 

==Virtual machine description==

===Memory===

CHIP-8 was most commonly implemented on 4K systems, such as the Cosmac VIP and the Telmac 1800. These machines had 4096 (0x1000) memory locations, all of which are 8 bits (a byte) which is where the term CHIP-8 originated. However, the CHIP-8 interpreter itself occupies the first 512 bytes of the memory space on these machines. For this reason, most programs written for the original system begin at memory location 512 (0x200) and do not access any of the memory below the location 512 (0x200). The uppermost 256 bytes (0xF00-0xFFF) are reserved for display refresh, and the 96 bytes below that (0xEA0-0xEFF) were reserved for the call stack, internal use, and other variables.

In modern CHIP-8 implementations, where the interpreter is running natively outside the 4K memory space, there is no need to avoid the lower 512 bytes of memory (0x000-0x1FF), and it is common to store font data there.

===Registers===

CHIP-8 has 16 8-bit data registers named V0 to VF. The VF register doubles as a flag for some instructions; thus, it should be avoided. In an addition operation, VF is the carry flag, while in subtraction, it is the &quot;no borrow&quot; flag. In the draw instruction VF is set upon pixel collision.

The address register, which is named I, is 12 bits wide and is used with several opcodes that involve memory operations.

===The stack===

The stack is only used to store return addresses when subroutines are called. The original RCA 1802 version allocated 48 bytes for up to 12 levels of nesting; modern implementations usually have more.

===Timers===

CHIP-8 has two timers. They both count down at 60 hertz, until they reach 0.

*Delay timer: This timer is intended to be used for timing the events of games. Its value can be set and read.
*Sound timer: This timer is used for sound effects. When its value is nonzero, a beeping sound is made. Its value can only be set.

===Input===

Input is done with a hex keyboard that has 16 keys ranging 0 to F. The &#x27;8&#x27;, &#x27;4&#x27;, &#x27;6&#x27;, and &#x27;2&#x27; keys are typically used for directional input. Three opcodes are used to detect input. One skips an instruction if a specific key is pressed, while another does the same if a specific key is &quot;not&quot; pressed. The third waits for a key press, and then stores it in one of the data registers.

===Graphics and sound===

Original CHIP-8 display resolution is 64×32 pixels, and color is monochrome. Graphics are drawn to the screen solely by drawing sprites, which are 8 pixels wide and may be from 1 to 15 pixels in height. Sprite pixels are XOR&#x27;d with corresponding screen pixels. In other words, sprite pixels that are set flip the color of the corresponding screen pixel, while unset sprite pixels do nothing. The carry flag (VF) is set to 1 if any screen pixels are flipped from set to unset when a sprite is drawn and set to 0 otherwise. This is used for collision detection.

As previously described, a beeping sound is played when the value of the sound timer is nonzero.

===Opcode table===

CHIP-8 has 35 opcodes, which are all two bytes long and stored big-endian. The opcodes are listed below, in hexadecimal and with the following symbols:

*NNN: address
*NN: 8-bit constant
*N: 4-bit constant
*X and Y: 4-bit register identifier
*PC : Program Counter
*I : 12bit register (For memory address) (Similar to void pointer);
*VN: One of the 16 available variables. N may be 0 to F (hexadecimal);

There have been many implementations of the CHIP-8 instruction set since 1978. The following specification is based on the SUPER-CHIP specification from 1991 (but without the additional opcodes that provide extended functionality), as that is the most commonly encountered extension set today. Footnotes denote incompatibilities with the original CHIP-8 instruction set from 1978.

<text>Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&amp;R), also known as physiatry, is a branch of medicine that aims to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to people with physical impairments or disabilities. This can include conditions such as spinal cord injury, brain injury, musculoskeletal injury, stroke, pain and spasticity from muscle, ligament, or nerve damage. PM&amp;R physicians lead rehabilitation teams and are trained in medication management, electrodiagnosis, and targeted injections. A physician having completed training in this field may be referred to as a physiatrist.

==Scope of the field==
Physical medicine and rehabilitation encompasses a variety of clinical settings and patient populations.

In hospital settings, physiatrists commonly treat patients who have had an amputation, spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other debilitating injuries or conditions. In treating these patients, physiatrists lead a team of physical, occupational, respiratory, and speech therapists, as well as nurses, psychologists, and social workers. . 

In outpatient settings, physiatrists treat patients with muscle and joint injuries, pain syndromes, non-healing wounds, and other disabling conditions. Physiatrists are trained to perform injections into joints or muscle as a pain treatment option. Physiatrists are also trained in nerve conduction studies and electromyography.

==History==
During the first half of the 20th century, two unofficial specialties, physical medicine and rehabilitation medicine, developed separately, but in practice both treated similar patient populations consisting of those with disabling injuries. Frank H. Krusen was a pioneer of physical medicine, which emphasized the use of physical agents, such as hydrotherapy and hyperbaric oxygen, at Temple University and then at Mayo Clinic and it was he that coined the term &#x27;physiatry&#x27; in 1938. Rehabilitation medicine gained prominence during both World Wars in the treatment of injured soldiers and laborers. Howard A. Rusk, an internal medicine physician from Missouri, became a pioneer of rehabilitation medicine after being appointed to rehabilitate airmen during World War II. In 1944, the Baruch Committee, commissioned by philanthropist Bernard Baruch, defined the specialty as a combination of the two fields and laid the framework for its acceptance as an official medical specialty. The committee also distributed funds to establish training and research programs across the nation. The specialty that came to be known as physical medicine and rehabilitation in the United States was officially established in 1947, when an independent Board of Physical Medicine was established under the authority of the American Board of Medical Specialties. In 1949, at the insistence of Rusk and others, the specialty incorporated rehabilitation medicine and changed its name to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

==Treatment==
The major goal of physical medicine and rehabilitation treatment is to help a person function optimally within the limitations placed upon them by a disabling impairment or disease process for which there is no known cure. The emphasis is not on the full restoration to the premorbid level of function, but rather the optimization of the quality of life for those not able to achieve full restoration. A team approach to chronic conditions is emphasized to coordinate care of patients. Comprehensive rehabilitation is provided by specialists in this field, who act as facilitators, team leaders, and medical experts for rehabilitation.

In rehabilitation, goal setting is often used by the clinical care team to provide the team and the person undergoing rehabilitation for an acquired disability a direction to work towards. Very low quality evidence indicates that goal setting may lead to a higher quality of life for the person with the disability, and it not clear if goal setting used in this context reduces or increases re-hospitalization or death.

Not only must a physiatrist have medical knowledge regarding a patient&#x27;s condition, but they also need to have practical knowledge regarding it as well. This involves issues such as: what type of wheelchair best suits the patient, what type of prosthetic would fit best, does their current house layout accommodate their handicap well, and other every day complications that their patients might have.

==Training==
In the United States, residency training for physical medicine and rehabilitation is four years long, including an intern year of general medical training. There are 83 programs in the United States accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, in 28 states.

Specifics of training differs from program to program but all residents must obtain the same fundamental skills. Residents are trained in the inpatient setting to take care of multiple types of rehabilitation including: spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, stroke, orthopedic injuries, cancer, cerebral palsy, burn, pediatric rehab, and other disabling injuries. The residents are also trained in the outpatient setting to know how to take care of the chronic conditions patients have following their inpatient stay. During training, residents are instructed on how to properly perform several diagnostic procedures which include electromyography, nerve conduction studies and also procedures such as joint injections and trigger point injections.

===Subspecialties===
Seven accredited sub-specializations are recognized in the United States:
* Neuromuscular medicine
* Pain medicine
* Pediatric rehabilitation medicine
* Spinal cord injury
* Sports medicine
* Brain damage
* Hospice and palliative medicine

Fellowship training for other unaccredited subspecialties within the field include the following:
* Musculoskeletal/Spine
* Stroke
* Multiple sclerosis
* Neurorehabilitation
* Electrodiagnostic medicine
* Cancer rehabilitation
* Occupational and environmental medicine

<doc id="1119706" wikidata="Q5501256" url="?curid=1119706" title="Freeways (album)">
<text>Freeways is the sixth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in 1977. It was the last album that Randy Bachman would be a part of with BTO until seven years later when a &quot;reunion&quot; &quot;Bachman-Turner Overdrive&quot; studio album was made and released in 1984. This is also the last studio album to be made with the band&#x27;s classic and most successful &quot;Not Fragile&quot; line up. It was the first BTO studio album to become a commercial failure, featuring the first BTO single that did not chart (&quot;My Wheels Won&#x27;t Turn&quot;). Randy Bachman wrote every song besides &quot;Life Still Goes On&quot;, while only two of the album&#x27;s eight songs featured Fred Turner as the lead vocalist.

Many of BTO&#x27;s core fans did not like the album, as it was not the heavy, guitar driven rock n&#x27; roll that BTO was known for. Turner was reportedly so unhappy with this album that he wouldn&#x27;t allow a straight-on picture of himself to be used on the cover, saying he felt like a &quot;side man.&quot; He went so far as to state that &quot;Freeways&quot; should have been a Randy Bachman solo album.

Years later, Randy would agree that the &quot;Freeways&quot; album was rushed to the studio, and that the band should have taken some down time, allowing them to develop more song ideas. He did however, mention &quot;Down Down&quot;, &quot;Shotgun Rider&quot;, and &quot;My Wheels Won&#x27;t Turn&quot; as songs that were worthy of inclusion on any BTO album, singling out the Duane Allman-esque guitar solo on &quot;My Wheels Won&#x27;t Turn&quot; as one of Blair Thornton&#x27;s finest moments on record.

This album was one of the last albums to reach the charts by any formation of BTO. The 8-track tape version of this album has the distinction of being one of the few 8-tracks that is arranged exactly like the album, with no song breaks.

<doc id="1119712" wikidata="Q4389210" url="?curid=1119712" title="King of Bavaria">
<text>The King of Bavaria () was a title held by the hereditary Wittelsbach rulers of Bavaria in the state known as the Kingdom of Bavaria from 1805 until 1918, when the kingdom was abolished. It was the second time Bavaria was a kingdom, almost a thousand years after the short-lived Carolingian kingdom of Bavaria.

==History==
Under the terms of the Treaty of Pressburg concluded 26 December 1805 between French Emperor Napoleon and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, several principalities allied to Napoleon were elevated to kingdoms. One of the staunchest of these had been the prince-elector of Bavaria, Maximilian IV Joseph, and on 1 January 1806, he assumed formally the title King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. He was a member of the Wittelsbach branch Palatinate-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken.

Maximilian&#x27;s successors resisted German nationalism, and Bavaria became the protector of smaller states whose leaders felt threatened by Prussia or Austria in the German Confederation. Religious ties and the Upper German language linked the state more to Austria until their defeat in the Austro-Prussian War. King Ludwig II signed an alliance with Prussia on 22 August 1866, effectively relinquishing Bavarian independence.

With the treaty of 23 November 1870 Bavaria was integrated into the new German Empire, but permitted a relatively large degree of self-determination. The Kings of Bavaria maintained their titles, and maintained separate diplomatic and military corps. When the German Empire was abolished in November 1918 after the end of World War I, the last king of Bavaria, Ludwig III, was deposed.

==Kings of Bavaria==
* Maximilian I Joseph 1805–1825
* Ludwig I 1825–1848 (d. 1868)
* Maximilian II 1848–1864
* Ludwig II 1864–1886
* Otto 1886–1913 (d. 1916)
** &quot;Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, Regent&quot; 1886–1912
** &quot;Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, Regent&quot; 1912–1913
* Ludwig III 1913–1918

The title &quot;King of Bavaria&quot; is sometimes used in reference to Carolingian kings ruling over Bavaria. See List of monarchs of Bavaria for these.

===List of kings===

==Current heir==

Franz Bonaventura Adalbert Maria Herzog von Bayern (born 14 July 1933), styled &quot;His Royal Highness The Duke of Bavaria&quot;, is head of the Wittelsbach family, the former ruling family of the Kingdom of Bavaria.

The succession to the headship of the family is determined by Article 2 of Title 2 of the 1818 Constitution of the Kingdom of Bavaria, which states, &quot;The crown is hereditary among the male descendants of the royal house according to the law of primogeniture and the agnatic lineal succession.&quot; The succession is further clarified by Title 5 of the Bavarian Royal Family Statute of 1819.

In 1948 and 1949 Crown Prince Rupprecht, with the agreement of the other members of the house, amended the house laws to allow the succession of the sons of princes who had married into comital houses. In 1999 Duke Franz, with the agreement of the other members of the house, amended the house laws further to allow the succession of the sons of any princes who married with the permission of the head of the house.

Franz has never married. The heir presumptive to the headship of the House of Wittelsbach is his brother Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria. Because Max has five daughters but no sons, he is followed in the line of succession by his and Franz&#x27;s first cousin (and second cousin in the male line) Prince Luitpold.

The current line of succession to the headship of the family is:

* &quot;Ludwig I of Bavaria (1786–1868)&quot;

<doc id="1119713" wikidata="Q6112316" url="?curid=1119713" title="Jack Elder (politician)">
<text>Jack Arnold Elder (born 3 July 1949) is a New Zealand former politician. He was an MP from 1984 to 1999, representing the Labour Party, New Zealand First and Mauri Pacific.

==Early life==
Jack Elder was born and raised in West Auckland, attending New Lynn Primary, Avondale Intermediate and Kelston Boys High School. At the latter, he was head boy and captain of the rugby first fifteen. Elder studied politics and history at the University of Auckland, graduating with a B.A in both History and Political Studies as well as a M.A in Political Studies. Upon graduation, he became a teacher at schools such as Henderson High School from 1974 to 1977 and Rutherford College from 1979 to 1981.

== Early political career ==
Alongside future prime minister Helen Clark and future Minister of Foreign Affairs Phil Goff, Elder was a member of Princes Street Labour. He became active in local politics, being a member of the New Lynn Borough Council from 1976 to 1983, including as deputy mayor from 1980.

Elder twice unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party nomination in safe electorates for the party. In 1975, he unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party candidacy for the electorate alongside 26 other aspirants following the retirement of Hugh Watt, but lost to Frank Rogers. In 1980, he put his name forward to replace long serving MP Warren Freer in the safe Labour seat of Mount Albert, but missed out on the nomination to Helen Clark. He did receive the nomination to stand in Helensville in the 1978 election and the 1981 election, but lost on both occasions.

==Member of Parliament==




=== Labour Party ===
Elder was first elected to Parliament in the 1984 election as the Labour MP for . He was re-elected in the 1987 election, the 1990 election, and in the 1993 election. Although Labour formed a government for the first of Elder&#x27;s two terms as an MP, he was not promoted to Cabinet.

In 1990, Elder was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. After the 1990 election, which Labour lost, he was appointed Shadow Minister of Agriculture by Mike Moore. In January 1993 he also picked up the Overseas Trade portfolio in a minor reshuffle.

=== Defection from Labour Party to New Zealand First ===
Within the Labour Party, Elder was a staunch supporter of Moore, and belonged to the more economically liberal wing of the party. When Helen Clark replaced Moore as party leader he was dropped from the Agriculture portfolio, but continued as Shadow Minister of Overseas Trade. Elder remained aligned with Moore and consequently he was ranked 40th on Labour&#x27;s initial party list for the 1996 general election, the lowest of any sitting Labour MP. In response he questioned his ties with Labour and position in parliament, not ruling out resigning and forcing a by-election.

Clark countered Elder&#x27;s critiques saying Elder&#x27;s list ranking reflected his lack of achievements as an MP. Elder bridled at Clark&#x27;s comments, pointing to his 29 year membership and his time as Shadow Minister of Agriculture where he laboriously explained party policy to &quot;incredulous farmers&quot;. He was clear that he didn&#x27;t blame Clark and thought party processes and policies were responsible for his dissatisfaction.

When suggestions arose that Moore would found a new party, Elder was considered likely to follow. In the end, Moore remained with Labour, but Elder was still dissatisfied. On 3 April 1996, Elder left the Labour Party to join New Zealand First, a centrist conservative party led by Winston Peters. He became New Zealand First&#x27;s spokesman for local government.

=== Coalition and Minority Government ===
In the 1996 election, Elder was re-elected to Parliament as a list MP for New Zealand First, having unsuccessfully contested the Waipareira electorate. When New Zealand First formed a coalition with the governing National Party, Elder was appointed to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister of Police, and Minister of Civil Defence. As Minister of Police, Elder officially opened the Queenstown Police Station on Friday 10 July 1998. When New Zealand First&#x27;s coalition with National began to collapse, however, Elder joined the group of MPs who quit New Zealand First and continued to offer support to the National Party government, which became a minority government. He officially left New Zealand First on 18 August 1998. In exchange for his continued support for the government, Elder was allowed to remain Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Civil Defence, although he was no longer part of Cabinet.

Later, Elder joined with four other former New Zealand First MPs to found the Mauri Pacific Party. Elder eventually chose not to seek re-election, and retired from politics at the 1999 election.

==Later life==
Elder spent time off from working, before returning to teaching two years after leaving Parliament.

<text>Street Action is the seventh studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO), released in 1978. It was the first BTO album released after the 1977 departure of co-founder Randy Bachman. As part of an agreement upon leaving, Randy requested the rights to the full Bachman surname to use for his pending solo album, then sold the rights to &quot;BTO&quot; and its trademarks to the remaining three band members. Thus, the band was required to release its next two albums (the remaining two under their contract with Mercury Records) using only BTO as the band name, and not Bachman-Turner Overdrive.

BTO replaced Randy Bachman with bassist/vocalist Jim Clench, who had most recently been in April Wine. Fred Turner, who played bass on all previous BTO releases, moved to rhythm guitar, and he shared lead vocal duties with Clench. &quot;Street Action&quot; had a distinctively heavier sound than the previous two BTO studio albums (&quot;Head On&quot; and &quot;Freeways&quot;).

The album was reissued in 2016 as part of the Bachman-Turner Overdrive Classic Albums Box Set.

==Production==
The album was recorded at Mushroom Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Street Action&quot; was met with negative reviews. 

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;C.F. Turner suffers from Bachman’s ailment of being unable to sing a cliché with enough conviction to make you forget it’s a cliché.&quot;

<doc id="1119719" wikidata="Q386027" url="?curid=1119719" title="Priority ceiling protocol">
<text>In real-time computing, the priority ceiling protocol is a synchronization protocol for shared resources to avoid unbounded priority inversion and mutual deadlock due to wrong nesting of critical sections. In this protocol each resource is assigned a priority ceiling, which is a priority equal to the highest priority of any task which may lock the resource. The protocol works by temporarily raising the priorities of tasks in certain situations, thus it requires a scheduler that supports dynamic priority scheduling.

== ICPP versus OCPP ==
There are two variants of the protocol: Original Ceiling Priority Protocol (OCPP) and Immediate Ceiling Priority Protocol (ICPP). The worst-case behaviour of the two ceiling schemes is identical from a scheduling view point. Both variants work by temporarily raising the priorities of tasks.

In OCPP, a task X&#x27;s priority is raised when a higher-priority task Y tries to acquire a resource that X has locked. The task&#x27;s priority is then raised to the highest priority had been blocked by itself, ensuring that task X quickly finishes its critical section, unlocking the resource. A task is only allowed to lock a resource if its dynamic priority is higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks. Otherwise the task becomes blocked, waiting for the resource.

In ICPP, a task&#x27;s priority is immediately raised when it locks a resource. The task&#x27;s priority is set to the priority ceiling of the resource, thus no task that may lock the resource is able to get scheduled. This ensures the OCPP property that &quot;A task can only lock a resource if its dynamic priority is higher than the priority ceilings of all resources locked by other tasks&quot;.

* ICPP is easier to implement than OCPP, as blocking relationships need not be monitored
* ICPP leads to fewer context switches as blocking is prior to first execution
* ICPP requires more priority movements as this happens with all resource usage
* OCPP changes priority only if an actual block has occurred

ICPP is called &quot;Ceiling Locking&quot; in Ada, &quot;Priority Protect Protocol&quot; in POSIX and &quot;Priority Ceiling Emulation&quot; in RTSJ.
It is also known as &quot;Highest Locker&#x27;s Priority Protocol&quot; (HLP).

<text>Unsui (), or kōun ryūsui () in full, is a term specific to Zen Buddhism which denotes a postulant awaiting acceptance into a monastery or a novice monk who has undertaken Zen training. Sometimes they will travel from monastery to monastery (angya) on a pilgrimage to find the appropriate Zen master with which to study.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;unsui&quot;, which literally translates as &quot;cloud, water&quot; comes from a Chinese poem which reads, &quot;To drift like clouds and flow like water.&quot; Helen J. Baroni writes, &quot;The term can be applied more broadly for any practitioner of Zen, since followers of Zen attempt to move freely through life, without the constraints and limitations of attachment, like free-floating clouds or flowing water.&quot; According to author James Ishmael Ford, &quot;In Japan, one receives unsui ordination at the beginning of formal ordained
practice, and this is often perceived as &#x27;novice ordination.&#x27;&quot;

According to the Oxford Dictionary of Buddhism, the term &quot;unsui&quot; is also used for 
Therefore, the translation of itinerant monk found on several Japanese-English online dictionaries.

<text>The Sherwin Range is a mountain range that is a sub-range of the Sierra Nevada system, in Mono County, eastern California. The range is also known locally as The Sherwins.

==Geography==
The Sherwin Range is immediately to the south of the Long Valley Caldera, and stretches from just south of the town of Mammoth Lakes. to the Wheeler Crest of the Sierra Nevada. The range lies to the south of the Long Valley Caldera.

The range is named after Jim Sherwin, a prospector who operated the first toll road across the Sierra. Its eastern terminus was at Mammoth Lakes.

==Recreation==
The Sherwin Range is within Inyo National Forest. It is well known for hiking opportunities in the summer, and backcountry skiing in the winter.

==Geology==
The range largely consists of reddish metamorphic rock, which are the roof pendant for the Sierra Nevada. This rock was formed in the Paleozoic Era, and then was subsequently recrystallized and warped by the intrusion of the Sierra Nevada batholith underneath it.

<doc id="1119729" wikidata="Q7354833" url="?curid=1119729" title="Rock n' Roll Nights">
<text>Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band BTO, released in 1979. This record was one of three BTO albums that did not feature co-founder Randy Bachman. &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; is also one of the two albums from this band to feature Jim Clench, formerly of April Wine. This LP generated worldwide sales of only about 350,000 copies, though a single from the album called &quot;Heartaches&quot; managed to reach #60 on the U.S. charts and cracked the Top 40 in Canada. &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; is a rare find on CD, as it was released only for a short time on that format in 1990.

The band used multiple outside songwriters on &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot;, including Jim Vallance of Prism and Bryan Adams (who penned the song, &quot;Wastin&#x27; Time&quot;). C.F. Turner and Jim Clench would later appear as session musicians for Adams&#x27; debut album in 1980, on which Adams recorded his own version of &quot;Wastin&#x27; Time&quot;.

The band played two songs — &quot;Heartaches&quot;, the last BTO single to chart, and &quot;Jamaica&quot;—live on American Bandstand in February 1979 to support the &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; album release. Producer Vallance played the piano for the TV taping of &quot;Heartaches&quot;. During an interview segment on the show, Dick Clark discusses concerns with the band about the increasing and dominating popularity of disco music at the time. Many consider disco and the decline of guitar-based hard rock in the late 1970s to be among the reasons that both &quot;Street Action&quot; and &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; sold so poorly.

After touring to support &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Nights&quot; through much of 1979, BTO officially disbanded in early 1980. They would not reform until 1983, with Randy Bachman back in the group.

The song &quot;Rock and Roll Hell&quot; would later be re-recorded, with new verses and a new arrangement, by Kiss in 1982, for the album &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;. In 2024, Bryan Adams released a recording of the Kiss version of the song as a limited-edition double A-side seven-inch single via his independent label, Bad Records. 

The song &quot;Jamaica&quot; would later be re-recorded, with new words, as &quot;Kristina&quot; by Rick Springfield on his 1982 album &quot;Success Hasn&#x27;t Spoiled Me Yet&quot;.

<text>or is a Pali term used to refer to the Buddhist monastic practice of almsround to the laity to receive almsfood and other necessities.

In Japanese Buddhism, this practice is also known as .
==Theravāda==
In Theravāda Buddhism, the practice is referred to by the Pāli term &quot;piṇḍacāra&quot; (). Monks or nuns on &quot;piṇḍacāra&quot; go around town on foot with their almsbowl under their outer robe and make themselves available to the laity to receive almsfood (, &quot;piṇḍapāta&quot;).

Owing, however, to the precarity inherent in almost all aspects of Theravāda monastic life, there is no guarantee of collecting enough food for the day, if any at all. This precarity is particularly observable outside the Indosphere, or even within it in times of societal or systemic crisis.
==Mahāyāna==
In the practice of &quot;takuhatsu&quot;, monks travel to various businesses and residences to chant sutras in Sino-Japanese (thus generating merit) in exchange for donations of food and money.

Monks generally wear traditional &quot;takuhatsu&quot; clothes reminiscent of medieval Japanese garb and wear the names of their monasteries on their satchels to confirm their identities. This system is used by Zen monks in training to beg for their food, and is generally done in groups of ten to fifteen. The group walks through a street in single-file, chanting , and the faithful gather to fill their alms bowls. This is the monks&#x27; offering of the Dharma and their lives of guardians of the Dharma to the people. According to Zen tradition, the givers should be grateful.

<doc id="1119737" wikidata="Q3326858" url="?curid=1119737" title="Movements for the annexation of Canada to the United States">
<text>Since the independence of the United States, various movements within Canada and the United States have campaigned in favor of U.S. annexation of parts of or all of Canada. Historical studies have focused on numerous small-scale movements which are helpful in comparisons of Canadian and American politics.

In the early years of the United States, many American political figures were in favour of invading and annexing Canada, and even pre-approved the admission of the Province of Quebec (previously known as Lower Canada) to the U.S. in the Articles of Confederation in 1777. During the American Revolutionary War, the Americans invaded the St. Lawrence River Valley, but were repelled. Americans also fought the British and allied Indigenous peoples in the Ohio Country — what was then the southwest of Quebec; at the end of the war, the land south of the Great Lakes was ceded to the newly independent United States and became the Northwest Territory. In the War of 1812, the Americans again invaded British North America in reprisal for the British impressment of American sailors on the high seas and support for Indigenous peoples resisting American westward expansion, but were repulsed again.

During and after the American Civil War, several American politicians called for the annexation of the Province of Canada because of Britain&#x27;s material support for the Confederacy, which one historian asserts lengthened the war by two years, mostly inflicted by Confederate blockade runners (which were mostly British-built) delivering arms supplies primarily from Britain. Confederate agents operating in Canada received support from a large portion of Canadians throughout the war, allowing the British colony to be used as a base to attack the U.S., such as in the St. Albans Raid. In the 1872 &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims, the U.S. was compensated $15.5 million in war reparations by the British for damages caused only by British-built Confederate commerce raiders, as part of the 1871 Treaty of Washington. Historian Joseph Levitt notes:

Surveys have suggested that a minority of Canadians would potentially support annexation, ranging from as many as 20 percent in a survey by Léger Marketing in 2001 to as few as seven percent in another survey by the same company in 2004.

After his election victory in 2024, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has renewed calls and discussion for a possible annexation of Canada as the 51st state of the United States. Canada responded strongly against these calls, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying on X that &quot;[t]here isn&#x27;t a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell that Canada would become a part of the United States&quot;.

==Historical annexationist groups==

===1837===
Historical annexationist movements inside Canada were usually inspired by dissatisfaction with Britain&#x27;s colonial government of Canada. Groups of Irish immigrants took the route of armed struggle, attempting to annex the peninsula between the Detroit and Niagara Rivers to the U.S. by force in the minor and short-lived Patriot War in 1837–1838. Not all rebels desired union with the United States; some fought for a separate nation independent from Britain and for liberal social reforms.

Despite some unrest, Canadian resentment of British rule never reached the degree that led to the American Revolution in 1775. Notably, Canada&#x27;s population growth in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was spurred largely by United Empire Loyalists, who left the American colonies during the Revolution because of their loyalty to Great Britain. In the period from 1790 to 1837, imperial officials repeatedly denounced American-style republicanism and tried to suppress it.

Between 1848 and 1854, a significant and articulate minority of conservatives in Upper Canada advocated constitutional changes modelled on the American federal-state system and the US Constitution. They critiqued Canada&#x27;s imitation of British parliamentary government as simultaneously too democratic and too tyrannical. They believed it destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and Legislative Council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. This critique led many conservatives to argue that the American model of checks and balances offered Canada a more balanced and conservative form of democracy than did British parliamentary government. These &quot;republican conservatives&quot; debated a series of constitutional changes, including annexation to the United States, an elected governor, an elected Legislative Council, a federal union of British North America, and imperial federation, within this framework. These conservatives had accepted &quot;government by discussion&quot; as the appropriate basis for political order.

===1850s===
Around 1850 there was a serious annexationist movement on the border region of Quebec&#x27;s Eastern Townships, where the American-descended majority felt that union with the United States would end their economic isolation and stagnation as well as remove them from the growing threat of French Canadian political domination. Leading proponents of this bipartisan movement were careful not to appear disloyal to Britain, however, and they actively discouraged popular protest at the local level. Fearful of American-style democracy, the local elite also expressed revulsion toward American slavery and militaristic expansionism. Consequently, the movement died as quickly in the Eastern Townships as it did in Montreal after Britain expressed its official disapproval and trade with the United States began to increase.

In Montreal at midcentury, with little immigration and complaints that the repeal of the Corn Laws had cut the region off from its British trade links, a small but organized group supported integrating the colonies into the United States. The leading organization advocating merger was the Annexation Association, founded in 1849 by an alliance of French Canadian nationalists and Anglophone businessmen in Montreal who had a common interest in the republic. Many of its members, including Louis-Joseph Papineau, were participants in the 1837-38 rebellions.

The Montreal Annexation Manifesto was published in 1849. It was hoped a merger with the United States would give Canada markets for its goods, ensure national security, and provide the finances to develop the west. A half measure was the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 that linked the two countries economically.

However, the movement died out in 1854. Annexation was never a very popular choice. Many Canadians were loyal to the Crown and Great Britain, especially the descendants of the United Empire Loyalists. French Canadians worried about being an even smaller minority in a larger union, and were concerned about American anti-Catholicism. The American Civil War, further, convinced many Canadians that the American experiment was a failure.

===1860s===

====British Columbia====
United States Secretary of State William Seward predicted in 1860 that western British North America, from Manitoba to British Columbia, would with Russian Alaska join the United States. Many in Britain, such as Goldwin Smith and &quot;The Times&quot; of London, were pessimistic about the future of British North America and agreed with Seward; &quot;The Times&quot; said that Britain would only object if the United States attempted to take the territory by force. In the late 1860s, residents of British Columbia, which was not yet a Canadian province, responded to the United States&#x27; purchase of Alaska with fear of being surrounded by American territory. Some residents wanted the colony to be the next American purchase. Local opinion was divided, as the three Vancouver Island newspapers supported annexation to the United States, while the three mainland newspapers rejected the idea. Even opponents of the annexation scheme admitted that Great Britain had neglected the region and that grievances were justified. Nonetheless, annexation sentiment disappeared within a few months and prominent leaders moved toward confederation with Canada.

Petitions circulated in favour of American annexation. The first, in 1867, was addressed to Queen Victoria, demanding that the British government assume the colony&#x27;s debts and establish a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to President Ulysses S. Grant, asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by Vincent Colyer, Indian Commissioner for Alaska, on December 29, 1869. Both petitions were signed by only a small fraction of the colony&#x27;s population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871.

====Nova Scotia====

Most Canadians were strongly opposed to the prospect of American annexation. Reports of the Annexation Bill of 1866 — a bill that, contrary to myth, never came to a vote — might have been one of the many factors behind Canadian Confederation in 1867. Much more serious were the Fenian raids made by Irish Americans across the border in 1866, which spurred a wave of patriotic feeling that helped the cause of Confederation.

Nonetheless, a substantial annexationist movement existed in Nova Scotia, and to a lesser degree in New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario, during the 1860s. Nova Scotia anti-confederationists led by Joseph Howe felt that pro-confederation premier Charles Tupper had caused the province to agree to join Canada without popular support. Howe in London unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the government to free Nova Scotia from the pending British North America Act by threatening American annexation. A significant economic downturn occurred after the end after 1866 of the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854; the colony was heavily dependent on selling fish to Americans, causing many to believe that free trade with the United States was necessary for prosperity. Anti-confederationists won all but two seats in the 1867 provincial election; as in British Columbia they did not necessarily support annexation. They again sent Howe to London to free Nova Scotia but in 1868 the British government again refused, believing that New Brunswick would likely follow Nova Scotia out of the dominion and cause the new nation to collapse.

Angry Nova Scotians began talking seriously of annexation. An alarmed Howe — who wished Nova Scotia to be free of Canada but still with Britain — warned his supporters against disloyalty, dividing anti-confederationists. The provincial government, dominated by extremists who now also opposed Howe, decided that if another appeal to London failed it would seize federal offices and unilaterally declare annexation, believing that Britain would not use force to stop Nova Scotia. Believing he had no choice, Howe left the anti-confederationists. Although he narrowly won reelection to his federal parliamentary seat in March 1869 as a confederationist, support for secession and annexation grew that year; however, by 1871 the movement had mostly disappeared. The federal government promised changes to taxes and tariffs, the economy revived, and the United States agreed to free trade for Canadian fish.

===1880s===
A Quebec-born homeopathic physician, Prosper Bender, expressed disappointment with the Canadian experiment in the 1880s and 1890s. An author and the former host of a literary circle in Quebec City, Bender suddenly moved to Boston in 1882. After celebrating the promise of Confederation, he became a strong proponent of annexation to the United States and something of an intercultural broker; he helped interpret French-Canadian culture to American readers. Bender wrote in the &quot;North American Review&quot; in 1883 that many Canadians believed that annexation by the United States would occur &quot;within the present generation, if not sooner&quot;. He believed that Irish Catholics — about one quarter of Canada&#x27;s population — would prefer annexation because of the British rule of Ireland. They would be joined by the majority of those under 40, who viewed the United States as a prosperous, fast-growing neighbour providing many opportunities. (The author attributed the absence of an active annexationist movement in part to many who would favor such an effort taking the &quot;easiest and quietest method of securing the benefits of annexation, by themselves silently migrating to the Republic&quot;, as more than a million already had.)

Bender believed that Prime Minister John A. Macdonald&#x27;s promise of a transcontinental railway linking eastern Canada to British Columbia to be overambitious and too expensive, and unfavourably compared the Canadian government&#x27;s growing debt to the United States&#x27; rapid reduction of its Civil War debt. He stated that Canadian businesses would benefit from duty-free access to the American market, while &quot;wondrous American enterprise, supported by illimitable capital&quot; would rapidly prosper Canada, especially its vast undeveloped interior. Bender concluded with pessimism about the likelihood of success of a nation divided in two parts by 1,200 miles of &quot;forbidding, silent wilderness stretching from the head-waters of the Ottawa to Thunder Bay, and thence to Manitoba&quot;.

===1890s===
In 1891, Goldwin Smith posited in his book &quot;Canada and the Canadian Question&quot; that Canada&#x27;s eventual annexation by the United States was inevitable, and should be welcomed if Canadians genuinely believed in the ideal of democracy. His view did not receive widespread support.

In January 1893, concerned about Canada&#x27;s possible annexation, a goal then being pursued by the Continental Union Association, a group of Ontario and Quebec Liberals, Prime Minister Sir John Thompson delivered a speech on tolerance, Canadian nationalism and continued loyalty to Britain. Thompson eventually learned that the desire to make Canada part of the U.S. was confined to a small minority amongst the Liberals.

===1900s===
In 1901 W. T. Stead, a newspaper editor in London, England, discussed in &quot;The Americanization of the World&quot; possible annexations of Canada and Newfoundland. He believed that because of its size and strength Canada would likely be the last of Britain&#x27;s possessions in the Americas to join the United States. Stead cited several reasons for why he believed annexation seemed &quot;inevitable&quot;, however, including rapidly growing economic ties and migration between the two countries, the French Shore, and disputes over the Alaska boundary and fishing rights in the Atlantic.

After the discovery of gold in the Yukon, many Canadians proposed to annex parts of Alaska currently controlled by the United States, by calling for a revision in the original map of the boundary line between the Russian Empire and the United States. The US offered to lease the territory but not to give it back. London and Washington agreed on arbitration, with one member of the panel from Canada. In 1903 the Chief Justice of Britain sided with the Americans to resolve the map dispute in favour of the United States. Many Canadians felt a sense of betrayal on the part of the British government, whose own national interest required close ties to the United States, regardless of the interests of Canada.

The 1932 establishment of the International Peace Garden on the North Dakota–Manitoba border honored the long lasting friendship between the two countries rather than attempts at annexation.

===1930s===
===Newfoundland in the mid 1940s===
While the Dominion of Newfoundland was still separate from Canada, prior to 1949, a party known as the Economic Union Party sought closer ties with the United States. However, Canada objected to the possibility, and the British government, which administered the Dominion of Newfoundland as a de facto colony under an appointed Commission of Government, would not allow it to consider annexation with the United States in any referendum. Instead, the EUP sought to resume &quot;responsible government&quot; and would then explore American annexation. A referendum showed a plurality in support of independence, but not a majority; a runoff referendum resulted in Newfoundland instead confederating with Canada to become the tenth province.

===Late 20th century===
The Unionest Party was a provincial political party in Saskatchewan in 1980 that promoted the union of the western provinces with the United States. It was the most politically successful annexationist group, but its success was both short-lived and extremely limited in scope. The party briefly had two members in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, both of whom crossed the floor from another party, but dissolved within a few weeks after failing to qualify for official party status.

The original Parti 51 was a short-lived political party in Quebec in the 1980s that advocated Quebec&#x27;s admission to the United States as the 51st state. The party won just 3,846 votes, or 0.11 percent of the popular vote in the province, in the 1989 election — fewer votes than the Marxist–Leninists or the satirical Lemon Party — and was dissolved the following year.

===21st century===
In 2016 Hans Mercier, a pro-American lawyer from Saint-Georges, Quebec, revived Parti 51 for a second time. Mercier told &quot;La Presse&quot; that the times have changed since the party&#x27;s previous era, as Quebec sovereigntism has waned in popularity. Mercier argued that Americans would be welcoming of a new Quebec state, and pointed to a survey taken during the administration of George W. Bush that suggested nearly 34 per cent of Quebecers would support joining the United States. The revived party ran five candidates and received just 1,117 votes provincewide in the 2018 Quebec general election, representing 0.03 percent of the provincewide popular vote. The party ran again and received just 689 votes provincewide in the 2022 Quebec general election, representing 0.02 percent of the provincewide popular vote.

One poll in the 2020s, noted by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, showed that about 50% of Americans are against Canada joining, 25% are in favor, and 25% are not sure.

== Proposals to annex Canada by Donald Trump ==
Starting in December 2024, then President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters began expressing support for Canadian annexation into the United States of America as its 51st state. This came after months of tariff threats on Canadian goods and renewed demands by Trump for Canada to increase its military spending and prioritize border security. However, most Canadian politicians dismissed this notion, and numerous Canadians expressed their opposition to the proposed merger, as indicated by public opinion surveys. President Trump has continued to make proposals to annex Canada following his inauguration as President of the United States.

=== Pre-inauguration proposals ===
In December 2024, during a tense meeting at Mar-a-Lago over trade deficits and border security, Trump suggested Canada consider becoming the 51st U.S. state if Prime Minister Trudeau felt his planned tariffs would hurt Canada&#x27;s economy. He referred to Trudeau as &quot;Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada&quot; and said he looked forward to meeting with him again to continue talks on tariffs and trade. During an appearance on Fox News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford humorously referred to the situation as former U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s attempt at revenge for the War of 1812 (which took place before Canada&#x27;s independence), and that he might still harbor a 212-year-old grudge over the burning of the White House by British forces.

On December 3, in response to an individual suggesting that Canada would be too liberal, Trump suggested that Canada would enter the Union as two states, one more conservative, one more liberal. Under this initial proposal, Canada would not remain as its current configuration of ten provinces and three territories, but would instead occupy at least two new positions in the U.S. federal structure, becoming the 51st and 52nd states. In a similarly humorous vein, Independent but left-leaning Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said he would back Trump&#x27;s plan to bring Canada in as a state, if they could expand Canada&#x27;s state-run health care system to all Americans.

On December 18, 2024, Trump posted on Truth Social advocating for Canada to become the 51st state. Trump claimed that many Canadians favor statehood due to potential tax savings and increased security. Trump continued to refer to Trudeau as the Governor and suggested that Canadian taxes would drop significantly, businesses would grow, and security would improve under U.S. statehood. He then proposed that Canadian ice hockey player, Wayne Gretzky, consider a run for Prime Minister or as the Governor and attested that he could win easily. Following speculation regarding Trudeau&#x27;s resignation, Trump reiterated his annexation proposals, claiming that this move would enhance trade and bolster national security by eliminating the border. Following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s resignation, former U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his suggestion that Canada join the United States. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump cited several factors, including the perceived Canadian interest for the idea, alleged U.S. deficits and subsidies, and the notion that these circumstances contributed to Trudeau&#x27;s resignation. Trump argued that statehood would eliminate tariffs, reduce taxes, and enhance security.

==== January 7 press conference ====
On January 7, 2025, during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump ruled out the use of military force to annex Canada, instead advocating for &quot;economic force&quot; to pressure Canada into joining. He argued that merging would enhance national security and reduce U.S. expenses on border protection. Trump then posted an image on Truth Social with the U.S. flag emblazoned across the territories of the U.S. and Canada with the caption referencing the national anthem of Canada. On the same day, Fox News commentator Jesse Watters expressed during a broadcast the desire for a military invasion of Canada saying that it would &quot;quench his imperialist thirst&quot;. He also stated that Canadians should consider it a privilege to be taken over by the United States.

Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago pre-inaugural comments on January 7 were widely condemned by Canadian politicians. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated there was &quot;not a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell&quot; of Canada joining the United States. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre affirmed, &quot;Canada will never be the 51st state. Period. We are a great and independent country.&quot; New Democratic Party Leader Jagmeet Singh criticized Trump as a &quot;bully&quot; and dismissed his proposal as absurd, saying, &quot;Cut the crap, Donald. No Canadian wants to join you.&quot; Statements criticizing Trump&#x27;s comments on Canada joining the US have also been made by other federal and provincial leaders and politicians.

Following the Mar-a-Lago remarks, Canadian government officials were reportedly no longer seeing Trump&#x27;s comments as satirical, but were now taking Trump&#x27;s &quot;threats&quot; seriously, with Minister Dominic LeBlanc stating on January 8, &quot;the joke is over.&quot;

=== Post-inauguration proposals ===
During his inaugural address on January 20, 2025. President Trump stated that during his second presidency the United States would expand its territory, which was in keeping with his pre-inaugural remarks, about annexing territory of other nations, including Canada&#x27;s.

==== Threat of tariffs ====

Prior to taking office for a second time, Trump had indicated his intention to apply heavy tariffs on Canada, as well as stating on January 7 that it was his ambition to use &quot;economic force&quot; to force Canada into joining the United States. Since taking office, Trump has continued to threaten Canada with broad tariffs.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum on January 23, Trump dismissed Canada&#x27;s importance as a trade partner, asserting that the United States does not rely on Canadian oil, gas, vehicles, or lumber. During his speech Trump reiterated his threats of broad tariffs, prompting concerns among Canadian political leaders and sparking discussions about potential countermeasures. Trump&#x27;s remarks align with his longstanding perspective that Canada poses a trade imbalance for the U.S. He has pointed to the U.S. trade deficit and argued that American self-sufficiency reduces the need for Canadian imports, However, this view is at odds with the economic reality that the U.S. depends heavily on Canadian crude oil to supply its refineries. During the speech at the WEF Trump stated, that Canada could avoid the tariffs by becoming a U.S. state. According to the press, Trump&#x27;s comment on Canada becoming the 51st state to avoid tariffs was met with shocked gasps in the hall.

On February 1, 2025, President Trump announced 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods that would take effect on February 4, 2025; this decision was met with anger by Canadian officials. The following day on February 2, taking to Truth Social, Trump reaffirmed his desire to annex Canada in a statement saying that Canada should become the &quot;Cherished 51st State&quot; promising no tariffs and guaranteeing their military security if they do. On February 3, after postponing the tariffs, Trump seemed to acknowledge it &lt;q&gt;would be a long shot,&lt;/q&gt; saying some unnamed people &lt;q&gt;don&#x27;t have a threshold for pain.&lt;/q&gt;

==== Other ====
On January 24, while holding a press conference in North Carolina, President Trump reaffirmed his stance that Canada should become the 51st state, making claims that under an American-controlled Canada, Canadians would be offered &quot;lower taxes&quot; and &quot;better health care&quot;.

=== Canadian responses to Trump&#x27;s proposals ===
President Trump&#x27;s proposals have been received broadly negatively in Canada, with it being condemned by all major political parties and leaders as well as causing increasing strain on Canadian–U.S. relations. Polling conducted on the proposals have shown little support by Canadians to the proposal of Canada becoming the 51st state. 

==== Stance of Canadian officials ====
Trump&#x27;s proposals have been widely condemned by Canadian officials at both a provincial and federal level. As Trump&#x27;s comments progressed, the stance of Canadian officials has changed from viewing the U.S. President&#x27;s proposal as satirical to viewing it more as a legitimate threat. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is publicly against the proposal of Canada joining the United States, stating &quot;there isn&#x27;t a snowball&#x27;s chance in hell&quot;. Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre stated that Canada will never become the 51st state. On February 7, 2025, Trudeau was caught on a hot mic moment where he acknowledged the possibility as &quot;a real thing&quot;. In the closed-door meeting, a source stated that Trudeau labelled it as interest in gaining access to Canada&#x27;s critical minerals.

In a press conference, the leader of the Green Party, Elizabeth May, hit back at the proposals from President Trump at length, stating the comments were &quot;never funny&quot;. May highlighted that Canada and the U.S. are very different, with Canada being a constitutional monarchy with a king as head of state, compared with America&#x27;s republican system with a president. May also jokingly invited three U.S. states to join Canada.

Canada&#x27;s head of state, Charles III, and his representative, the Governor General, have not commented on Trump&#x27;s proposals, due to the non-partisan role they play in the Canadian political system. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace stated that Trump&#x27;s annexation threats are &quot;not something we would comment on&quot;. Experts have said, however, that if the situation with the United States continues, the Canadian government could ask the King to get involved in a limited capacity, such as by visiting Canada.

==== Anti-American sentiment ====
Trump&#x27;s annexation and tariff threats have led to a noted increase in Canadian nationalism and patriotism since January 2025, including boycotts of American-manufactured goods, and Canadian fans booing and heckling the playing of the United States national anthem &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before sporting events involving American teams, whilst cheering and applauding the Canadian national anthem &quot;O Canada&quot;. An Ottawa-based branding company began selling caps with the slogan &quot;Canada is not for sale&quot;, satirizing the &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; caps worn by Trump and his supporters; the caps have received widespread media and political attention, with Ontario premier Doug Ford having frequently worn them publicly and during a meeting with other premiers, and the company struggling to keep up with demand for the hats.

The 4 Nations Face-Off—an NHL-hosted hockey tournament featuring teams representing Canada, Finland, Sweden, and the United States—was held in February 2025 amid the animosity created by Trump&#x27;s threats, with the American national anthem being booed by fans in Montreal during a Canada–United States round robin game, and some commentators drawing comparisons between the tournament and the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union. The tournament final was played in Boston between the United States and Canada teams, where American fans contrarily booed Chantal Kreviazuk&#x27;s performance of &quot;O Canada&quot;. In protest of the annexation threats, Kreviazuk notably changed the lyric &quot;in all of us command&quot; to &quot;that only us command&quot;. Following Canada&#x27;s overtime victory in the final, Trudeau remarked on X, &quot;You can&#x27;t take our country — and you can&#x27;t take our game&quot;.

=== Opinion polling ===

==== Canadian polling ====
Since Donald Trump&#x27;s comments on his support of annexing Canada, there have been a number of opinion polls conducted asking Canadians on their opinion of the proposal. The responses from Canadians have been overwhelmingly against Canada joining the United States as the 51st state.
==== American polling ====
Some polls have also been conducted asking American opinions on Canada being annexed as the 51st state. An Angus Reid poll reported 49% of Americans opposing the proposal and 25% supporting it, with 26% being unsure.

==Modern secessionist/annexationist groups==
Two modern provincial political parties have proposed that their province secede from Canada to join the United States. Neither attracted significant support.

=== Albertan annexationism ===
One of the most successful secessionist/annexationist movements to the United States was that of Albertan separatism. These movements have proposed various paths, including forming an independent nation, joining the United States, or creating a union with other Western provinces. Key issues driving separatist sentiment include a perceived power imbalance with Ottawa, long-standing economic grievances, a distinct cultural identity, and dissatisfaction with federal policies—particularly those affecting Alberta&#x27;s energy sector. The province&#x27;s early economic ties leaned heavily southward-midwest, with trade networks connecting Alberta to the United States rather than to eastern Canada. This north–south orientation contributed to feelings of alienation, as did fiscal policies such as equalization payments. Many Albertans view these payments as disproportionately burdening the province&#x27;s resource-rich economy. Such frustrations date back to Alberta&#x27;s establishment as a province in 1905, when initial hopes for fair treatment under Confederation gave way to concerns about overreach from the federal government.

The roots of separatist movements can be traced to the 1930s, particularly within the Alberta Social Credit Party under William Aberhart. Aberhart&#x27;s attempts to implement social credit policies to combat the Great Depression were stymied by federal disallowance, fueling resentment toward Ottawa. Although Aberhart himself urged moderation, his party&#x27;s struggles laid the groundwork for later separatist ideas. In the postwar era, the discovery of oil in Alberta transformed its economy. However, protectionist policies hindered industrial diversification, deepening grievances about federal control. By the 1970s, separatist sentiments had coalesced into more organized movements. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s National Energy Program (NEP), introduced in 1980, became a major flashpoint. The NEP imposed taxes and royalties on Alberta&#x27;s oil, triggering economic decline and widespread discontent. This period saw the rise of movements like the Western Canada Concept, which gained some traction despite internal divisions. The eventual dismantling of the NEP under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in the mid-1980s diminished the momentum of these separatist efforts. A renewed wave of separatist sentiment emerged in the late 2010s-20s, driven by federal policies under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Many Albertans perceived these policies as detrimental to the province&#x27;s energy sector and its economic autonomy. Polls reflected increasing frustration, and movements such as Wexit—drawing inspiration from Brexit—garnered attention. Groups like Wexit Alberta sought political legitimacy, though secession or outright annexation remained unlikely. A University of Alberta study found that support for separatism was approximately 29% in November 2019, but this figure declined to 19% by April 2022. While this separatist sentiment has simmered for some time, the Canadian government&#x27;s freezing of bank accounts during the &quot;Freedom Convoy&quot; protests in early 2022 escalated tensions. Although financial restrictions were lifted after two weeks, the incident amplified existing grievances, including government overreach on gun control, high taxes, and centralized management of Alberta&#x27;s natural resources. Currently, two registered separatist parties, the Wildrose Independence Party of Alberta and the Independence Party of Alberta, promote independence without advocating annexation by the United States. Few among Albertan secessionists supported actual annexation.

Insofar, the most vocal group in Alberta advocating for annexation to the United States is the Alberta 51 Project, founded in 2023. The Alberta 51 Project, according to its official website, calls for Alberta to adopt a new constitution and join the United States as its 51st state. This would grant Alberta approximately six electoral votes in Congress. Among the group&#x27;s stated goals are the elimination of customs barriers, a stronger military presence, the protections of the US Constitution, enhanced protection for land and resources, and economic stability through the U.S. dollar. To support its efforts, the Alberta 51 Project raises funds on its website through the sale of bumper stickers, claiming that it has collected nearly $1,100 through a fundraiser intended for promotional billboards. A Change.org petition organized by the Alberta 51 Project from October 2019, advocating Alberta&#x27;s statehood had garnered over 52,000 signatures as of June 2024. Although the petition does not carry as an official document, as the Alberta elections office has reported no active citizen initiative petitions related to this cause. Achieving statehood would require significant legal and political steps, including constitutional amendments by Canada&#x27;s Parliament and successful referendums in Alberta. Polling data suggests that fewer than a third of Albertans support annexation. Both Canadian officials and political analysts have pointed to the significant challenges involved, with many viewing the proposal as improbable. During an event in Calgary where American political commentator Tucker Carlson spoke with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a minor demonstration by members of the Alberta 51 Project took place. Demonstrators displayed signs and a Trump 2024 campaign flag in support of Alberta annexationism.

In recent years, Alberta has undertaken a multimillion-dollar campaign to promote itself across the U.S. to establish a more pronounced diplomatic presence and influence energy policy. It opened offices in Chicago, Seattle, and Denver within Canadian consulates and launched a $1.7 million ad campaign through the Canadian Energy Centre, promoting itself as a reliable energy partner at the eve of the Russo-Ukrainian War. An additional $2 million will be spent on public relations over two years to enhance its reputation. Former Premier Jason Kenney has frequently expressed Alberta&#x27;s dissatisfaction with both Canadian and American federal policies during his tenure. His criticism of U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline and of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for not lobbying Biden to preserve the project reflects long-standing frustrations and led to the government to initiate the program. Premier Jason Kenney reiterated the belief that Alberta&#x27;s economic contributions are often overlooked or undervalued, echoing a historic desire for greater recognition and autonomy from the federal government.

==== Alberta during Trump&#x27;s annexation proposals ====
Initially, current Alberta Premier, Danielle Smith, believed that Trump&#x27;s comments about annexing Canada were made in jest. However, amid escalating trade tensions between Canada and the United States following Trump&#x27;s annexation proposal, Smith refused to endorse a joint statement from provincial leaders and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau regarding Canada&#x27;s response to threats of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Previously, Following the first ministers&#x27; meeting in Ottawa, Smith expressed in a tweet of concerns about the federal government&#x27;s approach to energy policy. She claimed that federal officials were considering measures such as cutting off energy supplies to the United States and imposing export tariffs on Alberta&#x27;s energy and other products. Smith stated that Alberta could not fully support the federal government&#x27;s plans to address threatened tariffs unless such proposals were abandoned, further putting emphasis on Alberta&#x27;s opposition to export tariffs or bans on its energy and other products. Alberta&#x27;s refusal to sign the joint statement left it as the sole province opposed to a retaliatory policy. Instead, Alberta advocated for increasing U.S. purchases of Alberta oil and rejected measures such as curtailing, suspending, or taxing energy exports. This stance placed Smith at odds with the federal government and other premiers across Canada.

On January 12, Premier Danielle Smith set up an impromptu meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, as a guest of Canadian businessman and television personality Kevin O&#x27;Leary, discussing U.S.-Canadian energy relations. After her meeting with Trump, Smith has warned that blocking energy exports to the U.S. in response to President-elect Donald Trump&#x27;s tariff threats could lead to a &quot;national unity crisis&quot; in Canada. Smith emphasized that oil and gas resources are primarily owned by the provinces, particularly Alberta, and that such a move by the federal government would not be tolerated. She also remarked that, had the federal government proceeded with an export ban, she could not &quot;predict what Albertans would do.&quot; While Kevin O&#x27;Leary expressed support for Trump&#x27;s proposal, Premier Smith remained noncommittal, refraining from taking a definitive stance on the issue of annexation.

Since Trump took office on January 20, the Alberta provincial government, under Premier Danielle Smith, is actively lobbying U.S. lawmakers to prevent the implementation of former President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposed 25% levy on all Canadian goods, primarily that of Alberta&#x27;s key oil and gas exports. The tariff, originally set to take effect immediately, has been delayed until February 1, providing a brief window for negotiations. Smith has emphasized Alberta&#x27;s significance to the U.S. energy supply, noting that while Americans consume approximately 21 million barrels of oil daily, domestic production stands at only 13 million barrels. She also suggested reviving infrastructure projects such as the Northern Gateway and Energy East pipelines to strengthen energy transportation and distribution. Critics, including Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi, criticised Premier Smith&#x27;s actions for prioritizing Alberta&#x27;s interests over Canadian national unity. Smith then blamed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for damaging Canada&#x27;s relationship with the current U.S. administration, claiming it has further complicated the country&#x27;s position.

In response to U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s claim at the World Economic Forum on January 23 that the United States does not rely on Canadian oil, gas, vehicles, or lumber, Smith maintained a diplomatic stance. Smith re-emphasized the value of cross-border collaboration in the energy sector and rejecting public calls for retaliatory measures. She then urged the federal government to address concerns raised by Trump regarding border security and defense spending, while affirming that his remarks at the World Economic Forum have not altered her stance. Former Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and other critics, meanwhile, have characterized Trump&#x27;s statements as unrealistic, noting Canada&#x27;s essential role in the U.S. energy supply chain. Smith has cautioned that proposed U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports could lead to a sharp rise in gasoline prices in the United States, particularly in the Midwest, a politically significant region that heavily relies on Canadian crude oil. With Canadian crude comprising up to two-thirds of the gasoline supply in Midwestern markets, and 15 states entirely dependent on Canadian imports, Smith contends that such tariffs would ultimately harm American consumers rather than provide benefits. With the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Governors&#x27; Coalition for Energy Security as key allies who could advocate for the preservation of the cross-border energy partnership, Smith had hopes of lobbying U.S. Lawmakers away from tariffing Alberta. To reinforce Alberta&#x27;s role in continental energy security, Smith has launched a cross-border advertising initiative titled &quot;Alberta is the Answer.&quot; This campaign aims to raise awareness among U.S. decision-makers about Alberta&#x27;s critical contributions to energy, food, and data security. Former trade negotiator Steve Verheul emphasized that Canada&#x27;s success in renegotiating NAFTA relied on a cohesive national approach. He expressed concern that Alberta&#x27;s recent deviation from this strategy has significantly weakened Canada&#x27;s position. Verheul suggested that federal leaders work to bring Alberta&#x27;s government into alignment with the broader national strategy. Though at this time, other premiers have voiced some discontent over how the federal government&#x27;s should act on tariffs.

Amid ongoing tensions between the Alberta provincial government and Ottawa, Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson stated on January 29 that any Canadian countermeasures would be fair and would not disproportionately target Alberta. While preparing potential retaliatory tariffs, Wilkinson emphasized that these measures would be crafted to affect the U.S. more than Canada, focusing on goods for which Canadian consumers have viable alternatives. He expressed optimism that the tariffs could still be avoided, citing steps already taken to address U.S. border security concerns. This statement comes after Howard Lutnick, Trump&#x27;s nominee for Secretary of Commerce, reinforced the U.S. administration&#x27;s position, calling on Canada and Mexico to take stronger border security measures to avert the proposed tariffs—concerns cited by U.S. President Donald Trump as key justifications for imposing 25% tariffs on Canadian imports In response. She has then invited Fox News to report from the Coutts border crossing and endorsed the use of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Black Hawk helicopters for patrols along the Alberta and Manitoba borders. Smith then proposed that Canada appoint a &quot;border czar&quot; to work with U.S. officials on border security issues, particularly those concerning fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized crossings. Smith has argued that establishing such a position, alongside Ottawa&#x27;s $1.3-billion border security plan, would signal Canada&#x27;s commitment to improving border enforcement and could help prevent the imposition of tariffs. She has suggested that a retired military general, such as Alberta&#x27;s interim top bureaucrat Paul Wynnyk, could effectively fill the role, given their expertise in military operations and security logistics. While Smith acknowledged that appointing a border czar might not fully satisfy the Trump administration, she described it as a necessary step toward reducing trade tensions.

Following statements by U.S. President Donald Trump expressing interest in annexing Canada, Alberta has emerged as the province most supportive of such a proposal. A recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute indicated that approximately 18% of respondents in Alberta favored Trump&#x27;s annexation proposal, more than anywhere else in Canada. Historically in the U.S., some conservatives have expressed sympathy for Alberta&#x27;s position, but the same groups have previously opposed statehood bids from other territories, such as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

==== Analysis on Alberta ====
In his 2014 book &quot;The Accidental Superpower&quot;, American geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan suggested that both Alberta and the United States could benefit if Alberta became the 51st U.S. state. Zeihan argued that Alberta&#x27;s economic contributions significantly support the Canadian national budget, noting that it consistently contributes more than it receives. He projected that, by 2020, Alberta&#x27;s net financial contribution would exceed $20,000 per person, or $40,000 per taxpayer, which he characterized as one of the largest per capita wealth transfers in the Western world. Zeihan also highlighted the economic disparity between Alberta and other parts of Canada, suggesting that Alberta might maintain its prosperity more effectively outside of Canada. Though Zeihan&#x27;s assertion that Alberta would become the richest state in the Union remains speculative, it reflects ongoing debates about the province&#x27;s economic future and political alignment. Economists have noted that Alberta&#x27;s economy, often compared to that of Texas, has a strong reliance on oil, gas, and agricultural exports. Any shift in sovereignty would require complex negotiations, such as adopting new tax structures, renegotiating trade agreements, and determining how to manage Alberta&#x27;s extensive national parks and public lands. There are also concerns that Alberta&#x27;s exit from Canada could disrupt established trade relationships under existing agreements like NAFTA.

Jordan Peterson, an Alberta-born United States resident media commentator, describes Alberta&#x27;s position as increasingly tenuous, caught between federal policies that he claims stifle the province&#x27;s energy industry and a U.S. administration that perceives Canada as economically dependent. He suggests that Alberta might consider U.S. statehood if Canada fails to provide a compelling reason to remain part of the federation. He outlines potential economic advantages Alberta could gain by joining the United States, including lower taxes, improved market access, and enhanced infrastructure support. Peterson stops short of advocating for Alberta&#x27;s secession however. Instead, calling for a renewed national vision focused on economic growth, strengthening national identity, and self-reliance. He warns that without a significant policy shift, Canada risks economic stagnation while the U.S. continues to grow its influence and prosperity. &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; columnist David Staples argued that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s governance has alienated Alberta through policies that undermine its oil and gas industry, recalling past comments by Trudeau that framed Alberta&#x27;s influence as detrimental to Canada, reinforcing Western grievances about federal policies that restrict pipeline development and divert wealth from Alberta to the east. argues that an Alberta free from Trudeau&#x27;s policies could thrive economically, doubling oil production, reducing costs of living, and regaining regulatory autonomy.

By contrast, &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; political columnist Rob Breakenridge contended that President Trump&#x27;s proposal for Canadian statehood would be particularly harmful to Alberta. He argued that Alberta would lose its provincial autonomy, resources, and distinct identity. Assets such as the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund and energy royalties would come under centralized control, diminishing Alberta&#x27;s self-determination. Breakenridge dismissed statehood as impractical, instead calling for Canadians to address internal political divisions and instead emphasized the need for new Canadian leadership to address challenges from the Trump administration while maintaining Canada&#x27;s sovereignty and unity.

==Pro-annexation rhetoric==
While talking with a guest on &quot;Tucker Carlson Today&quot; in January 2023, American commentator Tucker Carlson provocatively questioned, &quot;We&#x27;re spending all this money to liberate Ukraine from the Russians, why are we not sending an armed force north to liberate Canada from Trudeau?&quot; Carlson then laughed at his own remark, describing it as a &quot;frenzy.&quot;

==Anti-annexation rhetoric==

In the 1911 federal election, the Conservative response to the proposed reciprocity treaty negotiated by the Liberals was to denounce it as equivalent to an American economic takeover, with annexation likely to follow. The parties swapped position in the later 1988 federal election, when the Liberals used the same type of rhetoric to denounce the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; proposed Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, although the Progressive Conservatives won that election and the agreement was implemented.

Annexation fears can be found throughout &quot;Canadian History for Dummies&quot;, in which humourist Will Ferguson stated that for &quot;John L. O&#x27;Sullivan, it was the &#x27;manifest destiny&#x27; of the United States to annex and possess all of North America&quot;. In fact, O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s use of the term never extended beyond potential American annexation of Texas and the Oregon Territory; he explicitly wrote that he did &quot;not&quot; believe that the United States had a destiny to annex Canada.

==Reverse annexation==

Political satirists, including the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, have occasionally proposed reverse annexation, whereby all or part the United States would be annexed into an expanded Canadian federation. Following the 2004 American election, some Americans distributed the satirical Jesusland map on the Internet, depicting a similar proposal under which the &quot;blue states&quot; were part of a new political entity called &quot;The United States of Canada&quot;. In 2019, there was a petition calling for the United States to sell Montana to Canada to pay off the U.S. debt.

On December 8, 2024, responding to Trump&#x27;s annexation proposal, Green Party of Canada leader Elizabeth May humorously suggested California, Oregon, and Washington join Canada instead, reviewing the idea of the Cascadia Movement. She offered universal health care and stricter gun laws just to &quot;get rid of all these states that always vote Democrat.&quot;

==Analysis==
One article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; tried to analyze the economic, social, and geographic implications on the United States. They noted that Canada is slightly larger in population than California, the largest current US state by population, but has about 25 times the land area of California. However, the economy is smaller than several US States, including California, New York, and Texas; overall the U.S. economy is ten times the size of Canada at the time. Economically, such a merger is predicted to increase trade, but result in increased competition for businesses.

Canadian author Don Tapscott analyzed and proposed conditions for a merger, including preserving Canada&#x27;s healthcare system, maintaining provincial identities as states, and introducing legal reforms on campaign finance, education funding, and gun control. Tapscott also noted that Ontario would become the fifth-largest state in the U.S. with 16 million residents, and that Canada spends 11% of its GDP on healthcare compared to the U.S.&#x27;s 19%, while achieving longer life expectancy. But critics say if annexation happens, nearly half of the population present in provinces could move and resettle across different states in the US and provincial population would see much decrease.

<text>An aul (; ) is a type of fortified village or town found throughout the Caucasus mountains and Central Asia.

They are generally built out of stone, on faces of ridges or against cliffs in order to provide protection against surprise attacks. Houses are usually two stories high, and they are staggered to make it virtually impossible for enemies to get anywhere on the roads. The houses usually have a southern aspect to take advantage of the sun in the winter and to be sheltered from the northern winds. Often, they are not located near good farmland or water sources, so it is necessary to bring water into the settlement.

In the 19th century, as Russia fought to conquer the Caucasus, auls were very formidable defences and could be taken for the most part only by storming.

The auls of Svaneti, Georgia, with their distinctive medieval towers, have been recognized as a World Heritage Site. Comparable towers may be found elsewhere in the Caucasus, specifically in Ingushetia.

<text>Bachman–Turner Overdrive is the ninth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in 1984. It is the last BTO studio album of original material to date and the only one without Robbie Bachman on drums. He disputed some of the agreements for the recording and reunion, including the choice of Tim Bachman instead of Blair Thornton, and declined to join. Garry Peterson, who was Randy Bachman&#x27;s bandmate in The Guess Who, plays drums on the album. The album was originally released on Compleat Records, but it is currently in print under the Sun Record label. The leadoff song, &quot;For the Weekend&quot;, was released as a single and also included an accompanying music video. Reaching #83 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;For the Weekend&quot; was the last BTO single to chart by any formation of the band.

<text>Neil Francis Kirton (born 16 May 1956) is a New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1996 to 1999, first as a member of the New Zealand First party and then as an independent. Before the splintering of New Zealand First, he was known as its leading dissident.

==Early life and education==
Born on 16 May 1956, Kirton was educated at Sacred Heart College, Auckland, and the University of Otago, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1978 and a Postgraduate Diploma in Science with first-class honours in 1979.

==Member of Parliament==


Kirton was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as a New Zealand First list MP, having contested the electorate. When New Zealand First formed a coalition with the governing National Party, Kirton was appointed Associate Minister of Health. Kirton soon became disillusioned with this arrangement, however, disliking the National Party&#x27;s health policies. He became increasingly critical of his party&#x27;s coalition with National, and in August 1997, he was fired from his role as Associate Minister of Health after quarreling bitterly with the Minister of Health, Bill English. Kirton accused English of breaching the coalition agreement between National and New Zealand First, and called National &quot;untrustworthy&quot; and &quot;deceitful&quot;. He then launched an unsuccessful campaign within New Zealand First to break off the coalition and come to an arrangement with the Labour Party.

On 24 October, it was announced that Kirton would not be seeking renomination for New Zealand First, with Kirton saying that the party had lost its principles. Kirton did not resign from the party, however, deciding to remain a member until the end of the Parliamentary term. He therefore remained a dissident, and frequently criticised the party&#x27;s leader, Winston Peters. He also continued to attack National&#x27;s health policies. He attacked his replacement as Associate Minister of Health, New Zealand First&#x27;s Tuariki Delamere, as a liar, and accused him of tamely accepting whatever the National Party wished.

By the middle of the following year, however, matters had reached the point where Kirton&#x27;s position in the party was no longer tenable, and on 28 July 1998, Kirton quit the party to become an independent. This deprived the government of its majority, leaving Parliament evenly split between the government and the opposition. As a result, the government was forced to do a deal with the United New Zealand party. Later, when the coalition between New Zealand First and National finally collapsed, the government&#x27;s majority became even more precarious, but it nevertheless managed to survive until the end of the term.

==Local politics==
Kirton did not seek re-election in the 1999 election, instead going into local politics. He was elected as the top-polling candidate in the Napier ward for both the 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 local body elections on the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council. He retired from local politics at the 2013 local body election, as was appointed as chief executive of the New Zealand Cancer Society&#x27;s Central Division.

<doc id="1119760" wikidata="Q5550599" url="?curid=1119760" title="Gergesa">
<text>Gergesa, also Gergasa (&quot;Γέργεσα&quot; in Byzantine greek) or the Country of the Gergesenes, is a place on the eastern (Golan Heights) side of the Sea of Galilee located at some distance to the ancient Decapolis cities of Gadara and Gerasa. Today, it is identified with El-Koursi or [[Kursi, Sea of Galilee|Kursi]]. It is mentioned in some ancient manuscripts of the Gospel of Matthew as the place where the Miracle of the Swine took place, a miracle performed by Jesus who drove demons out of a possessed man and into a herd of pigs. All three Synoptic Gospels mention this miracle, Matthew writes about two possessed men instead of just one, and only some manuscripts of his Gospel name the location as Gergesa, while the other copies, as well as all versions of Luke and Mark, mention either Gadara or Gerasa (see ). The &quot;Gerasa&quot; reading is problematic, because Gerasa is neither near a sea nor does it border Galilee.

Some are of the opinion that Gergesa was the country of the ancient Girgashites; but it is more probable that &#x27;Gergesenes&#x27; was introduced by Origen upon mere conjecture; as before him most copies seem to have read &#x27;Gadarenes&#x27;, agreeable to the parallel passages and the ancient Syriac version. In any event, the &quot;country of the Gergesenes/Gadarenes/Gerasenes&quot; in the New Testament Gospels refers to some location on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The name is derived from either a lakeside village, Gergesa, the next larger city, Gadara, or the best-known city in the region, Gerasa. It is likely that the &quot;Gerasa&quot; reading is erroneous and a copyist error for &quot;Gergesa,&quot; since only the latter place is bordering a lake while Gerasa is very far away from a lake.

==Interpretations==
&quot;Gergesenes&quot; means &quot;those who come from pilgrimage or fight.&quot;

Many New Testament manuscripts refer to the &quot;Country of the Gadarenes&quot; or &quot;Gerasenes&quot; rather than the Gergesenes. Both Gerasa and Gadara were cities to the east of the Sea of Galilee and the River Jordan. They were both Gentile cities filled with citizens who were culturally more Greek than Semitic; this would account for the pigs in the biblical account. Gerasa and Gadara are accounted for in historical accounts (by writers such as Pliny the Elder and Josephus) and by archaeological research. Today they are the modern towns of Jerash and Umm Qais.

A third city, Hippos, was similar in character to Gadara and Gerasa, and it may fit the biblical account even better. It was located on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, whereas Gerasa and Gadara were several kilometers south-east of it. Hippos, Gerasa, and Gadara were all counted in the Decapolis, an informal grouping of Greco-Roman cities just south of the ancient city of Caesarea Philippi.

==Identification with Kursi==
Byzantine monks venerated a site a few kilometres north of Hippos on the lakeshore as the miracle&#x27;s location. It is the only place fitting Matthew&#x27;s description, since it contains the only &quot;steep bank&quot; in the area descending to the shore of the lake. The site became known since at least the Early Muslim period as Kursya, the Aramaic word for &quot;chair&quot;, and later as , a word with the same meaning in Arabic, The monks built a walled monastic complex there and made it a destination for Christian pilgrims. That monastery was destroyed by the Sasanian military in 614, partially rebuilt, and finally levelled by the 749 Galilee earthquake. The remains of the monastery can be visited in the Kursi National Park. Christian artifacts from Kursi can be viewed at the Golan Archaeological Museum.

<doc id="1119761" wikidata="Q46644" url="?curid=1119761" title="Gogol Bordello">
<text>Gogol Bordello is an American punk rock band from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, formed in 1999 by musicians from all over the world and known for theatrical stage shows and persistent touring. Much of the band&#x27;s sound is inspired by Romani and Ukrainian music mixed with punk and dub, incorporating accordion and violin (and on some albums, saxophone).

The band has appeared in several popular films, most notably &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot; (2005) in which lead singer Eugene Hütz co-starred with Elijah Wood in a dramedy/adventure story about the Nazi purges in Ukraine. The group appears playing a brass band in a set that included the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and the traditional Yiddish song &quot;Bublitschki&quot;. Gogol Bordello contributed the song &quot;Start Wearing Purple&quot; to the film&#x27;s score. The band is the focus of the 2008 documentary &quot;Gogol Bordello Non-Stop&quot;. The band recorded the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Crazy&quot; for Coca-Cola&#x27;s Euro 2012 advertising campaign.

==History and influences==
&quot;Gogol&quot; comes from Nikolai Gogol, a classical writer of Ukrainian origin. He serves as an ideological influence for the band because he &quot;smuggled&quot; Ukrainian culture into Russian society, which Gogol Bordello intends to do with Romani/East-European music in the English-speaking world. &quot;Bordello&quot;, in Italian, refers to a brothel or a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s club&quot;. The band was originally titled Hütz and the Béla Bartóks, but Eugene Hütz says that they decided to change the name because &quot;nobody knows who the hell Béla Bartók is in the United States.&quot; The band played their first show as the unofficial band at an after-hours club called &quot;Pizdetz&quot; where they became the house band and DJ Hütz became the house DJ.

Gogol Bordello&#x27;s first single was released in 1999, and since then they have released six full-length albums, and one EP. In 2005 the band signed to punk label SideOneDummy Records. On 27 April 2010 Gogol Bordello made its major record label debut with &quot;Transcontinental Hustle&quot; on Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings, a subsidiary of Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment. Many of the songs on &quot;Transcontinental Hustle&quot; were inspired by Hütz&#x27;s move to Brazil.

The band has toured extensively throughout Europe and America. They have made numerous appearances at international festivals and have toured with such diverse bands as Primus, Flogging Molly, and Cake. In an interview with NPR, frontman Eugene Hütz cites Jimi Hendrix and Parliament-Funkadelic as among the band&#x27;s main musical influences. They have also mentioned Manu Chao, Fugazi, Zvuki Mu, Karamelo Santo, Sasha Kolpakov and The Clash as influences.

They performed live at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival 2011 for Bonnaroo&#x27;s 10 year anniversary, playing a 1.5 hour set in the middle of the night and performed with Devotchka.

Gogol Bordello released &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Crazy&quot; in 2012, the new song was part of Coca-Cola&#x27;s advertising campaign for the European Football Championships, which were part-hosted by Ukraine. The track samples one of their earlier singles, &quot;Wonderlust King&quot;, and the Coca-Cola advertising jingle.

In 2012 former guitarist Oren Kaplan sued Hütz for personal damages.

The 2010 song &quot;Immigraniada&quot; was remixed by Bassnectar, becoming a smash hit amongst his fans who hope for a live performance anytime the band and he are in proximity to each other.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Hütz released a video on social media condemning the Russian invasion, and has remained vocal about raising relief funds for the victims of the invasion. Gogol Bordello announced a benefit concert shortly after which sold out quickly, followed by announcing a benefit tour. Bordello collaborated with Les Claypool of the band Primus on the song &quot;Man with the Iron Balls&quot;, praising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&#x27;s courage. The proceeds of the track are set to benefit Nova Ukraine, a non-profit organization that provides humanitarian relief to the people of Ukraine.

<text>Independence Rock is a large granite rock, approximately high, long, and wide, which is in southwestern Natrona County, Wyoming along Wyoming Highway 220. During the middle of the 19th century, it formed a prominent and well-known landmark on the Oregon, Mormon, and California emigrant trails. Many of these emigrants carved their names on it, and it was described by early missionary and explorer Father Pierre-Jean De Smet in 1840 as the &quot;Register of the Desert&quot;. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 20, 1961 and is now part of Independence Rock State Historic Site, owned and operated by the state of Wyoming.

==Description==
The rock is a large rounded monolith of Archean granite typical of the surrounding region and is an isolated peak at the southeast end of the Granite Mountains. Its appearance is somewhat like the rounded Enchanted Rock of Texas or Uluru in Australia (formerly known as Ayers Rock), although smaller in size. It is located in the high plateau region of central Wyoming, north of the Sentinel Rocks ridge and adjacent to the Sweetwater River. It is accessible from a rest area on Wyoming Highway 220, approximately northeast of Muddy Gap and south-west of Casper.

==History==
The rock derives its name from the fact that it lies directly along the route of the Emigrant Trail. Pioneering wagon parties bound for Oregon or California usually left the Missouri River in the early spring and hoped to reach the rock by July 4 (Independence Day in the United States), in order to reach their destinations before the first mountain snowfalls. It was likely named prior to 1830. John C. Frémont camped a mile below this site on August 1, 1843 and made this entry in the journal of his 1843–1844 expedition:

Everywhere within six or eight feet of the ground, where the surface is sufficiently smooth, and in some places sixty or eighty feet above, the rock is inscribed with the names of travelers. Many a name famous in the history of this country, and some well known to science, are to be found among those of traders and travelers.

Fremont carved a large cross into the rock monolith, which was blasted off the rock on July 4, 1847 by hundreds of California and Oregon emigrants who had gathered on the site. Some Protestants considered the cross to be a symbol of the Pope and Catholicism. John Frémont was actually a member of the United States Episcopal Church.

On July 4, 1862, Independence Rock was the site of Wyoming&#x27;s first Masonic Lodge meeting.

<text>Chinese calligraphy is the writing of Chinese characters as an art form, combining purely visual art and interpretation of the literary meaning. This type of expression has been widely practiced in China and has been generally held in high esteem across East Asia. Calligraphy is considered one of the four most-sought skills and hobbies of ancient Chinese literati, along with playing stringed musical instruments, the board game &quot;Go&quot;, and painting. There are some general standardizations of the various styles of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and ink and wash painting are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and have a long history of shared artistry. Distinguishing features of Chinese painting and calligraphy include an emphasis on motion charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley-Baker, &quot;Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients.&quot; Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including seal carving, ornate paperweights, and inkstones.

== Characteristics ==
In China, calligraphy is referred to as &quot;shūfǎ&quot; or &quot;fǎshū&quot; (書法/书法, 法書/法书), literally &#x27;way/method/law of writing&#x27;; &quot;shodō&quot; () in Japan (&#x27;way/principle of writing&#x27;); and &quot;seoye&quot; (서예; 書藝) in Korea (&#x27;skill/criterion of writing&#x27;); &quot;thư pháp&quot; (書法) in Vietnam (&#x27;handwriting art&#x27;).

Chinese calligraphy appreciated more or only for its aesthetic quality has a long tradition, and is today regarded as one of the arts (Chinese 藝術/艺术 , a relatively recent word in Chinese) in the countries where it is practised. Chinese calligraphy focuses not only on methods of writing but also on cultivating one&#x27;s character (人品) and taught as a pursuit (－書法; , rules of writing Han characters).

Chinese calligraphy used to be popular in China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Hong Kong. In Taiwan, students were requested to write Chinese calligraphy starting from primary school all the way to junior high school on a weekly basis at least to the year 1980.

== Chinese script styles ==
=== Oracle bone script ===
Oracle bone script was an early form of Chinese characters written on animals&#x27; bones. Written on oracle bones—animal bones or turtle plastrons—it is the earliest known form of Chinese writing. The bones were believed to have prophecies written on them. The first appearance of what we recognize unequivocally to refer as &quot;oracle bone inscriptions&quot; comes in the form of inscribed ox scapulae and turtle plastrons from sites near modern Anyang (安陽) on the northern border of Henan province. The vast majority were found at the Yinxu site in this region. They record pyromantic divinations of the last nine kings of the Shang dynasty, beginning with Wu Ding, whose accession is dated by different scholars at 1250 BC or 1200 BC. Though there is no proof that the Shang dynasty was solely responsible for the origin of writing in China, neither is there evidence of recognizable Chinese writing from any earlier time or any other place. The late Shang oracle bone writings constitute the earliest significant corpus of Chinese writing and it is also the oldest known member and ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts, preceding the Chinese bronze inscriptions.

=== Chinese bronze inscriptions ===
Chinese bronze inscriptions were usually written on the Chinese ritual bronzes. These Chinese ritual bronzes include Ding (鼎), Dui (敦), Gu (觚), Guang (觥), Gui (簋), Hu (壺), Jia (斝), Jue (爵), Yi (匜), You (卣), Zun (尊), and Yi (彝). Different time periods used different methods of inscription. Shang bronze inscriptions were nearly all cast at the same time as the implements on which they appear. In later dynasties such as Western Zhou, Spring and Autumn period, the inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast. Bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the Chinese family of scripts, preceded by the oracle bone script.

=== Seal script ===
Seal script (Chinese: 篆書; pinyin: &quot;zhuànshū&quot;) is an ancient style of writing Chinese characters that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BC. It evolved organically out of the Zhou dynasty script. The Qin variant of seal script eventually became the standard, and was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the Qin dynasty.

=== Clerical script ===

The clerical script (traditional Chinese: 隸書; simplified Chinese: 隶书; pinyin: &quot;lìshū&quot;) is an archaic style of Chinese calligraphy. The clerical script was first used during the Han dynasty and has lasted up to the present. The clerical script is considered a form of the modern script though it was replaced by the standard script relatively early. This occurred because the graphic forms written in a mature clerical script closely resemble those written in standard script. The clerical script is still used for artistic flavor in a variety of functional applications because of its high legibility for reading.

=== Regular script ===
Regular script (traditional Chinese: 楷書; simplified Chinese: 楷书; pinyin: &quot;kǎishū; Hong Kong and Taiwan still use traditional Chinese characters in writing, while mainland China uses simplified Chinese characters as the official script.&quot;) is the newest of the Chinese script styles. The regular script first came into existence between the Han and Wei dynasties, and was not used commonly until later. The regular script became mature stylistically around the 7th century. The first master of regular script is Zhong Yao. Zhong Yao first used regular script to write some very serious pieces such as memorials to the emperor.

=== Semi-cursive script ===
Semi-cursive script (simplified Chinese: 行书; traditional Chinese: 行書; pinyin: xíngshū), is a cursive style of Chinese characters. Because it is not as abbreviated as cursive, most people who can read regular script can read semi-cursive. It is highly useful and also artistic.

=== Cursive script (East Asia) ===
Cursive script (simplified Chinese: 草书; traditional Chinese: 草書; pinyin: &quot;cǎoshū&quot;) originated in China during the Han dynasty through the Jin period (link needed). The cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. The &quot;grass&quot; in Chinese was also used in the sense of &quot;coarse, rough; simple and crude.&quot; It would appear that &quot;cǎo&quot; in the term caoshu &quot;grass script&quot; was used in this same sense. The term &quot;cǎoshū&quot; has broad and narrow meanings. In the broad sense, it is non-temporal and can refer to any characters which have been hastily written. In the narrow sense, it refers to the specific handwriting style in Han dynasty.

== History ==
=== Ancient China ===
Chinese characters can be retraced to 4000 BC signs ().

In 2003, at the site of Xiaoshuangqiao, about 20 km south-east of the ancient Zhengzhou Shang City, ceramic inscriptions dating to 1435–1412 BC have been found by archaeologists. These writings are made in cinnabar paint. Thus, the dates of writing in China have been confirmed for the Middle Shang period.

The ceramic ritual vessel vats that bear these cinnabar inscriptions were all unearthed within the palace area of this site. They were unearthed mostly in the sacrificial pits holding cow skulls and cow horns, but also in other architectural areas. The inscriptions are written on the exterior and interior of the rim, and the exterior of the belly of the large type of vats. The characters are mostly written singly; character compounds or sentences are rarely seen.

The contemporary Chinese character&#x27;s set principles were clearly visible in ancient China&#x27;s Jiǎgǔwén characters (甲骨文) carved on ox scapulas and tortoise plastrons around the 14th–11th century BCE (). Brush-written examples decay over time and have not survived. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved (Keightley, 1978). Each archaic kingdom of current China continued to revise its set of characters.

=== Imperial China ===

For more than 2,000 years, China&#x27;s literati—Confucian scholars and literary men who also served the government as officials—have been connoisseurs and practitioners of this art. In Imperial China, the graphs on old steles—some dating from 200 BC, and in &quot;xiǎozhuàn&quot; style (small seal script)—are still accessible.

Scribes in China and Mongolia practiced the art of calligraphy to copy Buddhist texts. Since these texts were so venerated, the act of copying them down (and the beautiful calligraphy employed) was supposed to have a purifying effect on the soul. &quot;The Act of copying them [Buddhist texts] could bring a scribe closer to perfection and earn him merit.&quot;

In about 220 BC, the emperor Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇, 259–210 BC), the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them Li Si&#x27;s (李斯, 246 BC – 208 BC) character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized &quot;xiǎozhuàn&quot; characters. Although the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, little paper survives from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

The &quot;lìshū&quot; style (clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, were also authorised under Qin Shi Huang. While it is a common mistake to believe that &quot;lishu&quot; was created by Cheng Miao alone during Qing Shi Huang&#x27;s regime, &quot;lishu&quot; was developed from pre-Qin era to the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD).

During the fourth century AD, calligraphy came to full maturity. The &quot;kǎishū&quot; style (traditional regular script)—still in use today—and attributed to Wang Xizhi (王羲之, 303 CE – 361 AD) and his followers, is even more regularized. reached its peak in the Tang dynasty, when famous calligraphers like Yan Zhenqing and Liu Gongquan produced most of the fine works in &quot;kaishu&quot;. Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926 CE – 933 AD), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in &quot;kaishu&quot;. Printing technologies here allowed shapes to stabilize. The &quot;kaishu&quot; shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of 广 which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.

Cursive styles such as &quot;xíngshū&quot; (semi-cursive or running script) and &quot;cǎoshū&quot; (cursive or sloppy script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles&#x27; stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from clerical script, at the same time as regular script (Han dynasty 202 BC – 220 AD), but &quot;xíngshū&quot; and &quot;cǎoshū&quot; were used for personal notes only and were never used as a standard. Caoshu style was highly appreciated during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (140 BC – 87 BC).

Styles which did not survive include &quot;bāfēnshū&quot;, a mix of 80% &quot;xiaozhuan&quot; style and 20% &quot;lishu&quot;. Some variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, were incorporated in the simplified Chinese character set.

=== Hard-pen calligraphy ===
This way of writing started to develop in the 1900s when fountain pens were imported into China from the west. Writing with fountain pens remained a convenience until the 1980s. With the Chinese economic reform, public focused on practicing hard-pen calligraphy. People usually use Chinese simplified characters in semi-cursive or regular style.

=== Printed and computer styles ===
Examples of modern printed styles are Song from the Song dynasty&#x27;s printing press, and sans-serif. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

=== Gallery along history ===
Different scripts of 馬 / 马 (horse) through history:
== Materials and tools ==
The ink brush, ink, paper, and inkstone are essential implements of Chinese calligraphy. They are known together as the &quot;Four Treasures of the Study&quot;. In addition to these four tools, a water-dropper, desk pads and paperweights are also used by calligraphers.
=== Brush ===

A brush is the traditional writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from bamboo or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from animal hair, such as weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn child, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher&#x27;s arm.

Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen.

=== Paper ===
Paper is frequently sold together with a paperweight and desk pad.

Some people insist that Chinese calligraphy should use special papers, such as Xuan paper, Maobian paper, Lianshi paper etc. Any modern papers can be used for brush writing. Because of the long-term uses, Xuan paper became well known by most Chinese calligraphers.

In China, &quot;Xuanzhi&quot; (宣紙), traditionally made in Anhui province, is the preferred type of paper. It is made from the Tatar wingceltis (&quot;Pteroceltis tatarianovii&quot;), as well as other materials including rice, the paper mulberry (&quot;Broussonetia papyrifera&quot;), bamboo, hemp, etc.

In Japan, &quot;washi&quot; is made from the &quot;kozo&quot; (paper mulberry), &quot;ganpi&quot; (&quot;Wikstroemia sikokiana&quot;), and &quot;mitsumata&quot; (&quot;Edgeworthia papyrifera&quot;), as well as other materials such as bamboo, rice, and wheat.

==== Paperweights ====
Paperweights are used to hold down paper. A paperweight is often placed at the top of all but the largest pages to prevent slipping; for smaller pieces the left hand is also placed at the bottom of the page for support. Paperweights come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or pictorial designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals. Like ink stones, paperweights are collectible works of art on their own right.

==== Desk pads ====
The desk pad (Chinese T: 畫氈, S: 画毡, Pinyin: huàzhān; Japanese: 下敷 shitajiki) is a pad made of felt. Some are printed with grids on both sides, so that when it is placed under the translucent paper, it can be used as a guide to ensure correct placement and size of characters. However, these printed pads are used only by students. Both desk pads and the printed grids come in a variety of sizes.

=== Ink and inkstick ===
Ink is made from lampblack (soot) and binders, and comes in inksticks which must be rubbed with water on an inkstone until the right consistency is achieved. Much cheaper, pre-mixed bottled inks are now available, but these are used primarily for practice as stick inks are considered higher quality and chemical inks are more prone to bleeding over time, making them less suitable for use in hanging scrolls. Learning to rub the ink is an essential part of calligraphy study. Traditionally, Chinese calligraphy is written only in black ink, but modern calligraphers sometimes use other colors. Calligraphy teachers use a bright orange or red ink with which they write practice characters on which students trace, or to correct students&#x27; work.

=== Inkstone ===
Commonly made from stone, ceramic, or clay, an inkstone is used to grind the solid inkstick into liquid ink and to contain the ink once it is liquid. Chinese inkstones are highly prized as art objects and an extensive bibliography is dedicated to their history and appreciation, especially in China.

=== Seal and seal paste ===
Calligraphic works are usually completed by the calligrapher applying one or more seals in red ink. The seal can serve the function of a signature.

== Technique ==
The shape, size, stretch, and type of hair in the brush, the color and density of the ink, as well as the absorptive speed and surface texture of the paper are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher also influences the result by the quantity of ink/water he lets the brush take up, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, acceleration and deceleration of the writer&#x27;s moves and turns, and the stroke order give &quot;spirit&quot; to the characters by influencing greatly their final shape. The &quot;spirit&quot; is referred to yi in Chinese calligraphy. Yi means &quot;intention or idea&quot; in Chinese. The more practice a calligrapher has, his or her technique will transfer from youyi (intentionally making a piece of work) to wuyi (creating art with unintentional moves). Wuyi is considered a higher stage for calligraphers, which require the calligrapher to have perfect control over the brush and wrist and following his or her heart.

== Study ==
Traditionally, the bulk of the study of calligraphy is composed of copying strictly exemplary works from the apprentice&#x27;s master or from reputed calligraphers, thus learning them by rote. The master showing the &#x27;right way&#x27; to draw items, which the apprentice have to copy strictly, continuously, until the move becomes instinctive and the copy perfect. Deviation from the model is seen as a failure. Competency in a particular style often requires many years of practice. Correct strokes, stroke order, character structure, balance, and rhythm are essential in calligraphy. A student would also develop their skills in traditional Chinese arts, as familiarity and ability in the arts contributes to their calligraphy.

Since the development of regular script, nearly all calligraphers have started their study by imitating exemplary models of regular script. A beginning student may practice writing the character 永 (, &quot;eternal&quot;) for its abundance of different kinds of strokes and difficulty in construction. The Eight Principles of Yong refers to the eight different strokes in the character, which some argue summarizes the different strokes in regular script.

How the brush is held depends on the calligrapher and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches the upper part of the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.

In Japan, smaller pieces of Japanese calligraphy are traditionally written while in seiza. In modern times, however, writers frequently practice calligraphy seated on a chair at a table. Larger pieces may be written while standing; in this case the paper is usually placed directly on the floor, but some calligraphers use an easel.

Basic calligraphy instruction is part of the regular school curriculum in both China and Japan and specialized programs of study exist at the higher education level in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In contemporary times, debate emerged on the limits of this copyist tradition within the modern art scenes, where innovation is the rule, while changing lifestyles, tools, and colors are also influencing new waves of masters.

Chinese calligraphy is being promoted in Chinese schools to counter character amnesia brought on by technology usage.

In recent study, Chinese calligraphy writing have been used as cognitive intervention strategy among older adults or people with mild cognitive impairment. For example, in a recent randomized control trial experiment, calligraphy writing enhanced both working memory and attention control compared to controlled groups.

In contemporary China, a small but significant number of practitioners have made calligraphy their profession, and provincial and national professional societies exist, membership in which conferring considerable prestige. By tradition, the price of a particular artist&#x27;s work is priced in terms of the length of paper on which it is written. Works by well-regarded contemporary calligraphers may fetch thousands to tens of thousands of yuan (renminbi) per &quot;chi&quot; (a unit of length, roughly equal to a foot) of artwork. As with other artwork, the economic value of calligraphy has increased in recent years as the newly rich in China search for safe investments for their wealth.

== Rules of modern calligraphy ==

While appreciating calligraphy depends on individual preferences, there are established traditional rules and those who repeatedly violate them are not considered legitimate calligraphers. The famous modern Chinese calligrapher Tian Yunzhang, member of the Chinese Calligrapher Association, summarized rules of modern calligraphy. The following rules are from &quot;One Question Every Day, One Word Every Day&quot; (), a calligraphy video column with deep analysis of different characters, lectured by Tian Yunzhang. Among these rules are:

*Correct way of writing. A correctly written character should be composed in a way that is accepted as correct by legitimate calligraphers. Calligraphic works often use variant Chinese characters, which are deemed correct or incorrect case-by-case, but in general, more popular variants are more likely to be correct. Correct characters are written in the traditional stroke order and not a modern standard.
*Legibility. As calligraphy is the method of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily legible to those familiar with the script style, although it may be illegible to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read cursive, but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if those familiar with cursive can read it.
*Conciseness. This is in contrast to Western calligraphy where flourishes are acceptable and often desirable. Good Chinese calligraphy must be unadorned script. It must also be in black ink unless there is a reason to write in other ink.
*Proper and prominent relation to the context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education contributed to their calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher&#x27;s characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters&#x27; shape and weight agrees with the rhythm of the phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.
*Aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Generally, characters that are written correctly, legibly, concisely, and in the correct context are also aesthetically pleasing to some degree. Characters that violate the above rules are often less aesthetically pleasing. An experienced calligrapher will consider the quality of the line, the structure of each character which the lines are placed, the compositional organization of groups of characters. Throughout the work, the brush line of light or dark, dry or wet should record the process of the artist creating the work vividly.

== Influences ==

=== Calligraphy in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam ===

The Japanese, Koreans, and Vietnamese have developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences, as well as applying to specific scripts. Japanese calligraphy extends beyond Han characters to also include local scripts such as hiragana and katakana.

In the case of Korean calligraphy, the Hangeul and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique.

In the case of Vietnamese calligraphy, the same styles and techniques have evolved to apply to &quot;Chữ Nôm&quot; and Latin script.

=== Other arts ===

==== Water calligraphy ====
The existence of temporary calligraphy, or water calligraphy, is also to be noted. This is the practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks in China.

==== Ink wash painting ====
Calligraphy has influenced ink wash painting, which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in East Asia, including Ink wash painting, a style of Chinese, Japanese, Korean painting, and Vietnamese based entirely on calligraphy.

<doc id="1119776" wikidata="Q6384307" url="?curid=1119776" title="Keith Edwards (footballer, born 1957)">
<text>Keith Edwards (born 16 July 1957) is an English retired footballer.

Edwards started his early career as a youth player with Leyton Orient in London, as his father was an Orient supporter. He became homesick and joined Sheffield United.

A prolific goalscorer, he had two spells (1975–1978 and 1981–1986) at Sheffield United for whom he scored 171 goals in 293 appearances. Whilst with the Blades, he was the highest scoring player in a division twice, scoring 36 goals (one for Hull City) in Division 4 in 1981–82 and 33 goals in Division 3 in 1983–84. The latter haul earned Edwards his second Adidas Golden Boot award.

His debut for United came in a FA Cup Third Round Tie against Leicester City on 3 January 1976 and his League debut came on 28 February 1976 in a Division 1 game against Queens Park Rangers. However, his first goal didn&#x27;t arrive until the next season in Division 2 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 24 August 1976.

In between his time at Bramall Lane he played for Hull City who paid £50,000 for Edwards in 1978. Ian Porterfield bought him back for £100,000 and played him for the first time against Scunthorpe United on 26 September 1981, the 1–0 home victory being the first of a 17-game unbeaten run. Edwards scored his first two goals under Porterfield in a 4–0 win over Crewe Alexandra three days later.

He formed an impressive partnership with Bob Hatton, feeding off the distribution of Colin Morris as United ended the season with 19 games without defeat to win the Fourth Division Championship, his 35 goals being a post-war record.

His final appearance for United came in a pre-season friendly at Bramall Lane against Spanish club Sevilla FC on 1 August 1986. He began the 1986–87 season at Leeds United after a transfer fee of £125,000 but only managed 9 goals in 51 appearances, although one of those was against Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1987. Despite his efforts, Leeds lost the game 3–2. They also missed out on promotion to the First Division weeks later, losing the relegation/promotion playoff final to Charlton Athletic in a replay.

Aberdeen secured his services later in 1987 and he returned to Hull City in 1988. He later played for Stockport County, Huddersfield Town and finished his career at Plymouth Argyle in 1990. He is one of the select band of players to have scored over 250 league goals in English football, although almost all of his career was spent outside the top flight.

In recent years, Keith has worked for BBC Radio Sheffield commentating on matches involving one of his former clubs, Sheffield United.

<doc id="1119777" wikidata="Q660086" url="?curid=1119777" title="Japanese calligraphy">
<text>, also called , is a form of calligraphy, or artistic writing, of the Japanese language. Written Japanese was originally based on Chinese characters only, but the advent of the hiragana and katakana Japanese syllabaries resulted in intrinsically Japanese calligraphy styles.

== Styles ==
The term shodō (書道, &quot;way of writing&quot;) is of Chinese origin and is widely used to describe the art of Chinese calligraphy during the medieval Tang dynasty. Early Japanese calligraphy was originated from Chinese calligraphy. Many of its principles and techniques are very similar, and it recognizes the same basic writing styles:

* seal script (篆書 tensho) (pinyin: &quot;zhuànshū&quot;). The seal script (tensho) was commonly used throughout the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC) and the following Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) of China. After this time period, tensho style fell out of popularity in favor of reisho. However, tensho was still used for titles of published works or inscriptions. The clear and bold style of tensho made it work well for titles and this tradition of using tensho only for titles is still around today. By the time Chinese characters and calligraphy migrated over to Japan, tensho was already only used for titles and as a result, was never commonly used in Japan. In 57 AD, the Chinese emperor Guangwu of Han presented a golden seal to a king of a small region near what is now known as Fukuoka Prefecture. While this seal was not made in Japan, it is believed to be the first instance of tensho in Japan. The first work in Japan that actually utilized tensho was during the Nara period (646–794) was a six-paneled screen called the Torige Tensho Byobu. Each panel is divided into two columns and each column has eight characters. The screen speaks to a ruler and recommends that he use the counsel of wise ministers in order to rule justly.
* clerical script (隷書 reisho) (pinyin: &quot;lìshū&quot;) The clerical script or scribe&#x27;s script (reisho) is a very bold and commanding style of Chinese calligraphy; each of the strokes are greatly exaggerated at the beginning and end. It was most commonly used during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) and the term reisho had many significant meanings but is now only known as one of the five styles of Chinese and Japanese calligraphy. Because of its bold style, the reisho technique is now reserved for large text applications such as plaques, signboards, titles of works, etc. This was its main purpose in Japan as well until the Edo period (1603–1868) when it was regarded as a calligraphic art form.
* regular script (楷書 kaisho) (pinyin: &quot;kǎishū&quot;) The regular script or block script (kaisho) is fairly similar in function to that of Roman block capitals. While Japanese kaisho varies slightly from Chinese kaisho, it is primarily based on Chinese kaisho script in both form and function. The Japanese kaisho style was heavily influenced by the Sui dynasty (581–618) and the following Tang dynasty (618–907). Early examples of this style in Japan are mostly various statue and temple inscriptions. This was during the early Heian period (794–1185) and as time progressed there was a movement in Japan to become more culturally independent and a version of kaisho developed that became uniquely Japanese and included a little bit of the gyosho style. As its influence spread, the primary use of the kaisho technique was to copy the Lotus Sutra. There was a second wave of influence during the Kamakura (1192–1333) and Muromachi (1338–1573) periods, but this was mostly by Zen monks who used a technique based on Zen insight and is different from the classic kaisho technique.
* semi-cursive (行書 gyōsho) (pinyin: &quot;xíngshū&quot;) The semi-cursive script (gyosho) means exactly what it says; this script style is a slightly more cursive version of kaisho script. This script was practiced at the same time as the reisho script. There are three different levels of &quot;cursiveness&quot; called seigyo, gyo, and gyoso. The style of gyosho utilizes a softer and more rounded technique, staying away from sharp corners and angles. In Japan many works were made using the gyosho technique during the early Heian period. Later in the Heian period, once Japan began to separate itself from China a Japanese version called wayo began to emerge. The Japanese version of gyosho became widely popular and became the basis of many schools of calligraphy. This was a result of gyosho meshing very well with both kanji and hiragana and writing with this technique was both natural and fluid.
* cursive (草書 sōsho) (pinyin: &quot;cǎoshū&quot;). The cursive script (sosho) has its origins in the Han dynasty. It was used by scribes as a cursive version of reisho for taking notes. Early examples of sosho include inscriptions on bamboo and other wooden strips. This technique can be easily recognized by many strokes ending with a sweep to the upper right in a breaking-wave type form. As the Han dynasty came to an end, another version of sosho was developed, but this version was written slowly as opposed to the faster sosho that was popular until then. The exact date when sosho was introduced is unclear. Several texts from Japan shared many sosho-like techniques with Chinese texts during this time but it was not until Kukai, a famous Japanese Buddhist monk and scholar traveled to China during the early Heian period and brought back copies of texts that he made written in the sosho style.

== Tools ==
A number of tools are used to create a work of modern calligraphy.
* The four most basic tools were collectively called the .
** A 
** An .The hardened mixture of vegetable or pine soot and glue in the shape of a stick. The best inksticks are between 50 and 100 years old.
** An to grind the inkstick against, mixed with water.
* Other tools include:
** A to hold the paper in place
** A to place under the paper (often newsprint is used as well) to prevent ink from bleeding through.
** A . The art of engraving a seal is called &quot;tenkoku&quot; 篆刻. The student is encouraged to engrave his own seal. The position of the seal or seals is based on aesthetic preferences. One is not allowed to put a seal on calligraphy of a sutra.
During preparation, water is poured into the inkstone and the inkstick is ground against it, mixing the water with the dried ink to liquefy it. As this is a time-consuming process, modern-day beginners frequently use bottled liquid ink called . More advanced students are encouraged to grind their own ink. Paper is usually placed on a desk, while a large piece of paper may be placed on the floor or even on the ground (for a performance).

The brushes come in various shapes and sizes, and are usually made using animal hair bristles. Typical animal hair may come from goats, sheep, or horses. The handle may be made from wood, bamboo, plastic or other materials.

== History ==

=== Chinese roots ===

The Chinese roots of Japanese calligraphy go back to the 13th century BC, to the late Shang dynasty, a time when pictographs were inscribed on bone for religious purposes. When this writing developed into an instrument of administration for the state, the need for a uniform script was felt and Li Si, prime minister in the Chinese dynasty of Qin, standardized a script and its way of being written. He sanctioned a form of script based on squares of uniform size into which all characters could be written from eight strokes. He also devised rules of composition where horizontal strokes are written first and characters are composed starting from top to bottom, left to right. Because the symbols were inscribed with sharp instruments, the lines were originally angular; and in many ways, Li Si&#x27;s achievements were made obsolete by the appearance of brush and ink (see Chinese calligraphy). The ink-wet brush creates a line quite different from a sharp stylus. It affords variation in thickness and curve of line. Calligraphy retained the block form of Li Si and his eight strokes, but the writer was free to create characters that emphasized aesthetically pleasing balance and form. The way a character was written gave a message of style.

Calligraphy in the Chinese tradition was thus introduced to Japan about AD 600 Known as the &quot;karayō&quot; tradition, it has been practiced up to today, rejuvenated continuously through contact with Chinese culture.

The oldest existing calligraphic text in Japan is the inscription on the halo of the Medicine Buddha statue in the Hōryū-ji Temple. This Chinese text was written in &quot;Shakyōtai&quot; () style, prominent in the Chinese Six Dynasties period.

=== Before the Nara period ===

The Hōryū-ji Temple also holds bibliographic notes on the Lotus Sutra: the was written early in the 7th century and is considered the oldest Japanese text. It is written in Cursive script and illustrates that calligraphy in the Asuka period was already refined to a high degree.

The oldest hand-copied sutra in Japan is the Kongō Jōdaranikyō. Copied by the priest Hōrin in AD 686, the calligraphy style shows influences from the work of Ouyang Xun.

 (mid-7th century) and &quot;Stone in Nasu County&quot; are also typical examples from this time. Both inscriptions were influenced by the Northern Wei robust style.

In the 7th century, the Tang dynasty established hegemony in China. Their second Emperor Taizong esteemed Wang Xizhi&#x27;s calligraphic texts and this popularity influenced Japanese calligraphers. All of the original texts written by Wang Xizhi have been lost, and copies such as &quot;Gakki-ron&quot; written by the Empress Kōmyō are highly regarded as important sources for Wang Xizhi&#x27;s style. However Wang&#x27;s influence can barely be overstated, in particular for the &quot;wayō&quot; style unique to Japan: &quot;Even today, there is something about Japanese calligraphy that retains the unchanged flavour of Wang Xizhi&#x27;s style&quot;.

=== Heian period ===

Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Heijō-kyō in Nara, first to Nagaoka-kyō in 784, and then to Heian-kyō, Kyoto in 794. This marks the beginning of the Heian era, Japan&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot;. Chinese influences in calligraphy were not changed in the early period. For example, under the Emperor Saga&#x27;s reign, royalty, the aristocracy and even court ladies studied calligraphy by copying Chinese poetry texts in artistic style.

Wang Xizhi&#x27;s influences remained dominant, which are shown in calligraphies written by Kūkai or Saichō. Some other Chinese calligraphers, such as Ouyang Xun and Yan Zhenqing were also highly valued. Their most notable admirers were Emperor Saga and Tachibana no Hayanari respectively.

At the same time, a style of calligraphy unique to Japan emerged. Writing had been popularized, and the &quot;kana&quot; syllabary was devised to deal with elements of pronunciation that could not be written with the borrowed Chinese characters. Japanese calligraphers still fitted the basic characters, called &quot;kanji&quot; , into the squares laid out centuries before. A fragment, &quot;Kara-ai no hana no utagire&quot; (韓藍花歌切, AD 749) is considered the first text to show a style unique to Japanese calligraphy; it shows a Tanka poem using Man&#x27;yōgana, thus deviated from contemporary Chinese calligraphy. Ono no Michikaze (AD 894–966), one of the so-called &quot;sanseki&quot; , &quot;Three Brush Traces&quot;), along with Fujiwara no Sukemasa and Fujiwara no Yukinari, is considered the founder of the authentically Japanese &quot;wayō&quot; style, or &quot;wayō-shodō&quot; . This development resonated with the court: Kūkai said to Emperor Saga, &quot;China is a large country and Japan is relatively small, so I suggest writing in a different way.&quot; The , a poem written by Emperor Saga on the occasion of Saichō&#x27;s death, was one of the examples of such a transformation. Ono no Michikaze served as an archetype for the &quot;Shōren-in&quot; school, which later became the &quot;Oie&quot; style of calligraphy. The &quot;Oie&quot; style was later used for official documents in the Edo period and was the prevailing style taught in the &quot;terakoya&quot; schools of that time.

=== Kamakura and Muromachi period ===

The ascension of Minamoto no Yoritomo to the title of &quot;shōgun&quot;, following the Hōgen and Heiji rebellions, and the victory of the Minamoto clan over the Taira, marked the beginning of the Kamakura period (AD 1185–1333), but not quite yet to a return to peace and tranquility. The era is sometimes called &quot;the age of the warriors&quot; and a broad transition from court influences to a leading role of the military establishment pervaded the culture. It is also, however, a time when exchanges with China of the Song dynasty continued and Buddhism greatly flourished. Zen monks such as Shunjo studied in China and the copybooks that he brought with him are considered highly influential for the &quot;karayō&quot; tradition of the time, expressing a clear kaisho style. But this was not the only example, indeed a succession of Chinese monks were naturalized at that time, encouraged by regent Hōjō Tokiyori. Rankei Doryū founded the Kenchō-ji temple in Kamakura and many of his works have been preserved. However, with the rise of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism a less technical style appeared, representative of Zen attitudes and exemplified in the works of Musō Soseki who wrote in a refined sosho style, or Shūhō Myōcho (1282–1337; better known as Daito Kokushi), the founder of Daitoku-ji in Kyoto, who had not traveled to China to study. In terms of &quot;wayō&quot; style, the works of Fujiwara no Shunzei and Fujiwara no Teika are considered outstanding examples of the late Heian and early Kamakura.

Political and military unrest continued throughout the Muromachi period (AD 1336–1537), characterized by tensions between imperial and civil authority and periods of outright civil war. However, as Ashikaga Takauji had ousted Emperor Go-Daigo from Kyoto to establish his own &quot;bakufu&quot; there, the intermingling of residual members of the imperial court, courtiers, &quot;daimyōs&quot;, samurai, and Zen priests resulted in vibrant cultural impulses. The arts prospered, but are not considered as refined as that of earlier times. Of note is the role of Ikkyū Sōjun, a successor of Shūhō Myōcho at Daitoku-ji; Ikkyū was instrumental in elevating the appreciation of calligraphy to an integral part of the tea ceremony in the 15th century.

=== Edo period ===
Tokugawa Ieyasu centralized power in his shogunate between 1603 and 1615. This marked the beginning of the Edo period, which brought 250 years of relative stability to Japan, lasting until the second half of the 19th century. The period was marked by seclusion from overseas influences with the policy. Calligraphic studies were essentially limited to the study of &quot;karayō&quot; style works, via Ming-dynasty China. Indigenous developments were contributed by Ingen and the Ōbaku sect of Zen buddhism, and the Daishi school of calligraphy. The latter focused on the study of the , which go back to Wang Xizhi, and the 72 types of &quot;hissei&quot; (&quot;brush energy&quot;) expounded by Wang Xizhi&#x27;s teacher, the Lady Wei. The 1664 reprint of a copybook based on these principles in Kyoto contributed an important theoretical development. Calligraphers such as Hosoi Kotaku, who authored the five-volume &quot;Kanga Hyakudan&quot; in 1735, further advanced the &quot;karayō&quot; style. Very characteristic for the early Edo period was an innovation by Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu (1558–1637) who had paper made to order and painted a backdrop of decorative patterns, butterflies or floral elements that his calligraphy established a poetic correspondence with. Together with Konoe Nobutada (1565–1614) and Shōkadō Shōjō (1584–1639) – the three &quot;Kan&#x27;ei Sanpitsu&quot;  – he is considered one of the greatest calligraphers in the &quot;wayō&quot; style at the time, creating examples of &quot;a uniquely Japanese calligraphy&quot;.

Around 1736 Yoshimune began relaxing Japan&#x27;s isolation policy and Chinese cultural imports increased, in particular via the port of Nagasaki. Catalogues of imported copybooks testify to a broad appreciation of Chinese calligraphers among the Japanese literati who pursued the &quot;karayō&quot; style: &quot;traditionalists&quot; studied Wang Xizhi and Wen Zhengming, while &quot;reformists&quot; modeled their work on the sōsho style of calligraphers such as Zhang Xu, Huaisu and Mi Fu. In terms of &quot;wayō&quot;, Konoe Iehiro contributed many fine kana works but generally speaking, &quot;wayō&quot; style was not as vigorously practised as &quot;karayō&quot; at that time. Nevertheless, some examples have been preserved by scholars of , or poets and painters such as Kaga no Chiyo, Yosa Buson or Sakai Hōitsu.
=== Meiji and modern period===
In contemporary Japan, shodo is a popular class for elementary school and junior high school students. Many parents believe that having their children focus and sit still while practicing calligraphy will be beneficial. In high school, calligraphy is one of the choices among art subjects, along with music or painting. It is also a popular high school club activity, particularly with the advent of performance calligraphy. Some universities, such as University of Tsukuba, Tokyo Gakugei University and Fukuoka University of Education, have special departments of calligraphic study that emphasize teacher-training programs in calligraphy.

==Connection to Zen Buddhism==
Japanese calligraphy was influenced by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any particular piece of paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with the brush. The brush strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence shows up in the work. The calligrapher must concentrate and be fluid in execution. The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at a moment in time (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.

Zen calligraphy is practiced by Buddhist monks and most &quot;shodō&quot; practitioners. To write Zen calligraphy with mastery, one must clear one&#x27;s mind and let the letters flow out of themselves, not practice and make a tremendous effort. This state of mind was called the by the Japanese philosopher Nishida Kitaro. It is based on the principles of Zen Buddhism, which stresses a connection to the spiritual rather than the physical.

Before Japanese tea ceremonies (which are connected to Zen Buddhism), one is to look at a work of &quot;shodō&quot; to clear one&#x27;s mind. This is considered an essential step in the preparation for a tea ceremony.

<text>Peter McCardle (born 28 September 1955), is a New Zealand politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1990 to 1999, first as a member of the National Party, then as a member of New Zealand First, and finally as an independent. McCardle was deputy mayor of Upper Hutt from 2007 to 2013.

==Pre-parliamentary career==
McCardle originally worked for the New Zealand Employment Service, and was prompted to enter politics by a desire to make a significant contribution to unemployment and welfare policy.

==Member of Parliament==



McCardle was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 election as the National MP for the Heretaunga electorate, defeating the Labour MP Bill Jeffries. McCardle was re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating Labour Party candidate Heather Simpson.

McCardle, however, found his party colleagues unwilling to adopt his radical employment policies, which were primarily based around the idea of &quot;workfare&quot;. In 1996, after being involved in failed discussions with Mike Moore to form a new party, McCardle eventually decided to leave National and join New Zealand First, where he hoped to have greater influence. He duly became New Zealand First&#x27;s spokesperson for Employment.

McCardle was re-elected to Parliament as a New Zealand First list MP in the 1996 election, also unsuccessfully contesting the Rimutaka seat. In the coalition government formed by National and New Zealand First, McCardle became Minister of Employment, and set about implementing some of his proposals. When the coalition began to collapse, McCardle joined the group that broke from New Zealand First to continue supporting the government. He did not retain his Employment portfolio, but was given other ministerial roles including Minister of Consumer Affairs and Associate Minister of Social Services, Work and Income (with responsibility for Work and Income). He remained an independent for the duration of the parliamentary term, but did not choose to seek re-election in 1999.

==Post-parliamentary career==

Soon after the 1999 election the ACT MP Muriel Newman, who was her party&#x27;s welfare spokesperson, hired McCardle as a consultant. McCardle eventually was offered the role as head of the ACT Parliamentary Research Unit. He left this role in 2005 to write his memoirs.

In the 2001 local body elections and district health board elections McCardle was elected as an Upper Hutt City councillor and Hutt Valley District Health Board member. He successfully defended both roles in the 2004 and 2007 elections. After the 2007 elections he was additionally appointed deputy mayor of Upper Hutt, a position he maintained until 2013.

McCardle resigned from the Hutt Valley District Health Board in 2008, when he was hired as a senior advisor to the new National Party Minister of Health, Tony Ryall. McCardle and Ryall entered Parliament together in 1990. After Ryall&#x27;s retirement in 2014, McCardle continued working under the successive Health Minister, Jonathan Coleman.

McCardle was elected to his fourth and final term on the Upper Hutt City Council in 2010. He stood down from the council at the 2013 election to campaign against local-body amalgamation in the Wellington region.

<text>Timeline is a 2003 historical science fiction adventure film directed by Richard Donner and starring Paul Walker, Frances O&#x27;Connor, Gerard Butler, Billy Connolly, David Thewlis, and Anna Friel. Based on Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1999 novel of the same name, the screenplay concerns a team of present-day archaeology and history students who are sent back in time to medieval France to rescue their professor from the middle of a battle.

Jerry Goldsmith composed the original score, which would have been his last before his death in 2004 (his actual last score was &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;), but was replaced with a new score by Brian Tyler, after the first cut was re-edited and Goldsmith&#x27;s increasing health problems prevented him from continuing. The film was poorly received by critics and bombed at the box office, losing an estimated $49 million.

==Plot==

Professor Edward Johnston leads an archaeological study Castlegard, a village near La Roque Castle in Dordogne, France and the site of the 1357 hanging of Lady Claire, sister to Arnaut de Cervole. Her martyrdom led France to win the Hundred Years War against the English. While excavating a nearby monastery, Johnston&#x27;s team finds a sarcophagus containing the remains of a French knight with a lopped ear, holding the hand of his lady, an unheard-of practice for the time.

Johnston travels to the American headquarters of the ITC Corporation, his project&#x27;s sponsor, to inquire whether or not they have tampered with the site. Johnston&#x27;s students Kate Erickson, Josh Stern, and François Dontelle, along with Scottish archaeologist André Marek; and his son Chris, discover a lens from Johnston&#x27;s bifocals and a note begging for help, although both date over 600 years old. When they contact ITC, the company invites them to its headquarters.

There, the team is introduced to ITC president Robert Doniger and vice-president Steven Kramer. In the process of developing teleportation technology, ITC locked onto a stable wormhole to 1357 Castlegard. Johnston was invited to see the past for himself, but his group has not returned, and ITC wants Marek and company to go back in time to locate him. All but Josh volunteer to go.

The volunteers are stripped of all modern technology save for pendant-shaped markers they can use to initiate their return. They are joined by a security team including ITC&#x27;s head of security, Frank Gordon, and two former military men.

On arrival in 1357, the team finds itself in the path of a young woman chased by English knights; the security men are killed while protecting the group, although one activates his marker after priming a grenade. When his body arrives in the present, the grenade detonates and shatters much of the teleportation device. Josh aids Kramer in making repairs.

The team evades the knights, and the woman leads them to the English-controlled Castlegard. They are captured and brought before Lord Oliver de Vannes and his second-in-command, DeKere. De Vannes kills François, believing that he is a French spy. The others are imprisoned along with Johnston, who previously promised de Vannes that he could make Greek fire for the English in exchange for his life. They make their escape but are pursued by the English. Gordon and Johnston are recaptured, while the others make for the monastery, led by the woman.

DeKere reveals himself to Gordon and Johnston as former ITC employee William Decker; he had frequently used the teleportation device but was not told by ITC that each use damaged his DNA until it was too late, at which point he would die on a return trip. He plans revenge on ITC and kills Gordon. De Vannes orders his knights to march on LaRoque castle, and DeKere brings Johnston along.

At the monastery, Marek, Kate, and Chris meet de Cervole and realize that the woman is Lady Claire; they have changed history by saving her. Kate and Chris help to swing the upcoming battle in the French&#x27;s favor by leading de Cervole&#x27;s men through the monastery tunnels they had previously mapped to the castle.

As the battle starts, Marek is captured while trying to rescue his friends; Lady Claire is also kidnapped. Marek frees himself, Lady Claire, and Johnston, while Chris helps de Cervole defeat de Vannes. Enraged, DeKere slashes off Marek&#x27;s earlobe, and Marek realizes that he is destined to be the knight in the sarcophagus. Marek defeats DeKere, recovers the markers, gives them to the others, and says his goodbyes while running off to help the French assure victory and restore history.

In the present, Josh and Kramer finish the repairs. Doniger, who tried to sabotage their attempts, fears that when the students&#x27; stories become public, ITC will suffer great financial losses. As the machine activates, Doniger races into it, attempting to block the teleportation, but instead is sent back to 1357, where he arrives outside the castle and is presumably killed by a charging knight.

Chris, Kate, and Johnston safely return. Later, the team returns to the Castlegard ruins, re-examines the sarcophagus, and finds that Marek and Lady Claire lived together after the war and had three children: Christophe, Katherine, and François.

==Production==
The battle sequences used medieval reenactors. Richard Donner limited the use of CGI in the film as much as possible.

Composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had previously collaborated with Donner on &quot;The Omen&quot;, completed a score for the film - his final score before his death in 2004 - but it was replaced by a different score composed by Brian Tyler after Donner was forced to re-cut the film at the insistence of Sherry Lansing, the then-head of Paramount Pictures. However, both Goldsmith and Tyler&#x27;s scores were released on CD.

==Reception==
&quot;Timeline&quot; performed poorly at the box office, only recouping $43 million worldwide from a budget of $80 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 13% based on reviews from 144 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;This incoherently plotted addition to the time-travel genre looks and sounds cheesy&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 28% based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on a scale of A to F.

Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;Glorious so-bad-it&#x27;s-good entertainment.&quot;
Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4, and wrote that it was &quot;not so much about travel between the past and the present as about travel between two movie genres&quot; namely &quot;a corporate thriller crossed with a medieval swashbuckler&quot;. He was disappointed that the elaborate premise was not put to greater use, that it was essentially nothing more than a frame for action scenes. 
Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Lacks the consistent tone, pace and point of view for either a science fiction thriller or medieval war adventure.&quot;

<text>007 Racing is a 2000 racing video game based on the James Bond license. It was developed by Eutechnyx, published by Electronic Arts, and released for the PlayStation console system. This game marks the seventh appearance of Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s James Bond; the game included his likeness but not his voice, which is provided by Tim Bentinck. Including many revived characters from previous entries, the game is considered to be a spin-off of the original chronicles.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;007 Racing&quot; the player takes on the role of British secret agent James Bond, behind the wheel of several of his vehicles from the then-19 official films. Cars include the Aston Martin DB5 made famous in its initial appearance in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the Lotus Esprit from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, and the BMW Z8 that briefly appeared in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; as well as seven other automobiles. Each car is equipped with all the usual gadgetry and weapons issued by Q, the Quartermaster of a special branch of MI6 referred to as Q-Branch.

==Plot==
In &quot;007 Racing&quot;, a high-ranking European diplomat and businessman plan to hijack a shipment of NATO weapons and smuggle them to international terrorists inside cars that roll off the assembly line of his automotive plants. As Bond, it is up to the player to stop him. The gamer is supplied with several gadget-filled cars from the Bond universe to thwart the villain.

The story opens with Bond rescuing Cherise Litte from an Eastern European country (presumably Estonia) and getting her over the border in his Aston Martin DB5. Upon his return to London, he is informed by M that a freighter carrying top secret NATO weapons including laser-guided surface-to-air missiles, long-range missiles, missile shields, latest GPS technology and Q equipped BMW 750iL bound for Halifax was intercepted in the Labrador Sea, south of Greenland. Bond is tasked with finding the cargo. His mission takes him to New York City, where he is met by his friend from the CIA Jack Wade. Upon arriving in New York he is informed by a villain that a bomb has been planted on his car and that any attempt to defuse it or slow down the vehicle will cause it to explode. Bond jettisons the car in the Hudson River.

Bond continues with finding the electromagnetic pulse device that was stolen and destroying ten computers in the distribution center from which a car transporter carrying the smuggling cars. He intercepts the transporter with his Aston Martin. Bond then goes to Mexico with his BMW Z3, where he is pointed by questioning the transporter driver, the henchman Whisper. He is trying to track Zukovsky and once he manages, he finds out that behind everything is Dr Hammond Litte, Cherise&#x27;s father, and that her rescue was just a decoy mission aiming to distract him from the freighter. Bond then engages in a race with Xenia Onatopp and her Ferrari F355 after which he gets captured and taken to Louisiana. He manages to escape and finds the stolen BMW, after which he pursues and destroys the boat driven by Jaws.

Back in New York, Bond downloads the files from four limousines with his BMW Z8 and discovers that Litte&#x27;s real plan is to release a deadly virus that will kill millions. Bond then goes to the Baltic Sea with his Lotus Esprit and after infiltrating the opponent&#x27;s underwater base he destroys the plane transporting the virus.

==Development and release==
&quot;007 Racing&quot; was developed by Eutechnyx, which worked with MGM to create the game&#x27;s storyline. It includes objectives and vehicles based on those featured in the James Bond films. &quot;007 Racing&quot; uses a modified version of the game engine that was developed for Eutechnyx&#x27;s earlier &quot;Le Mans 24 Hours&quot;. Lead programmer Peter Davies recalled in 2021: &quot;given the huge differences in the game style it was a massive overhaul, but some core components like the physics engine, renderer, and build tools were retained.&quot;

In North America, &quot;007 Racing&quot; was released in November 2000. A sequel for the PlayStation 2 was announced shortly thereafter, but was never released.

==Reception==
&quot;007 Racing&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

&quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Paul Anderson called the graphics &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;nasty&quot;, but said there are some &quot;well-designed&quot; missions. He called the voice acting &quot;excellent&quot;, particularly praising the performance given by Cleese, but thought the game had an inconsistent mix of content.

Douglass C. Perry of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that &quot;007 Racing&quot; is &quot;a decent little game, as long as you don&#x27;t expect too much from it&quot;. He added: &quot;It&#x27;s not original, nor is it good looking. It&#x27;s filled with awkward spots and questionable areas (like when I reached the broken bridge in Escape and the vocals chimed in after it was too late to launch my parachute), and it becomes a chore rather than fun. Occasionally, there are little flashes of goodness (Escape and Gimme a Break are examples), but the game never really reaches any new planes of play that we&#x27;ve did already experience in Spy Hunter, back in the early 1980s. I mean if you&#x27;re simply dying to drive Bond cars, rent this game, but don&#x27;t buy it full price. Now, if you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;ve got an old-school arcade to find.&quot;

Jeff Gerstmann of &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave a mixed review, stating: &quot;The game&#x27;s varied mission objectives occasionally give it a &quot;Driver&quot;-like feel, but the clunky control issues really manage to take you out of the game. The heavily modified &quot;Need for Speed&quot; engine is great for the fast action, fast driving missions, but the slower-paced, more combat-heavy levels suffer from the game&#x27;s rough control. Overall, &quot;007 Racing&quot; isn&#x27;t polished enough to fill the needs of objective-based driving game fans. Fans of these types of games would be better served by &quot;Driver 2&quot;.&quot; &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; criticized the slow pace of the missions. David Chen of &quot;NextGen&quot; said that the game was &quot;Fine as a rental car, but not worth the sticker price.&quot; Jake The Snake of &quot;GamePro&quot; said that the game &quot;offers mild fun that will appeal for sure only to gamers who love both Bond and action-driving games.

<doc id="1119797" wikidata="Q3624907" url="?curid=1119797" title="Jewish quota">
<text>A Jewish quota was a discriminatory racial quota designed to limit or deny access for Jews to various institutions. Such quotas were widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries in developed countries and frequently present in higher education, often at prestigious universities.

==By countries==

===Canada===

Some universities in Canada, notably McGill University, the Université de Montréal and the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, had longstanding quotas on the number of Jews admitted to the respective universities. McGill University’s strict quota was the longest-running, having been officially adopted in 1920 and remaining in place until the late 1960s.

===Germany===
In Germany, a whole series of &quot;numerus clausus&quot; resolutions were adopted in 1929 on the basis of race and place of origin, not religion.

On 25 April 1933, the Nazi government introduced a 1.5% quota for new admissions of German non-Aryans—ie., essentially of German Jews—as core issue of a law claiming to generally limit the number of (Aryan and non-Aryan) students admitted to high-schools (&quot;höhere Schulen&quot;) and universities. In addition, high-schools and universities deemed to have more students than required for the professions for which they were training their students were required to reduce their student enrollment; in doing so, they had to reach a maximum of 5% of German non-Aryan students. The law was supposedly enacted to avoid overcrowding schools and universities, which cited apparent concerns at the time that large numbers of students would decrease the quality of higher education in Germany. At the beginning of 1933, about 0.76% of the German population was Jewish, but more than 3.6% of German university students were Jewish, this number having steadily declined from over 9% in the 1880s. After 30 July 1939, Jews were no longer permitted to attend German public schools at all, and the prior quota law was eliminated by a non-public regulation in January 1940.p. 193

In addition to their strong and predominantly antisemitic agenda, the law and subsequent regulations were temporarily used to limit general university access to other groups that were not deemed &quot;non-Aryan&quot;, as the name of the law implied. Starting in 1934, a regulation limited the overall numbers of students admitted to German universities, and a special quota was introduced reducing women&#x27;s admissions to a maximum of 10%. Although the limits were not entirely enforced, the women&#x27;s quota stayed a bit above 10% mainly because a smaller percentage of men than women accepted their university admissions, which made it approximately twice as hard for women to enter a university career than for men with the same qualification.S. 80ff. After two semesters, these admission limits were revoked, however, leaving in place the non-Aryan regulations.p. 178

===Hungary===

The &quot;Numerus Clausus&quot; Act was introduced in 1920, under the government of Pál Teleki. It was said that the ethnic makeup of student bodies must meet the ethnic rate of population. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.

===Poland===

See Numerus clausus in Poland and Ghetto benches.

===Romania===

&quot;Numerus Clausus&quot; was not introduced by law, but it was adopted by students in the universities Cluj, Bucharest, Iasi and Cernauti.

===Russia===

&quot;Numerus Clausus&quot; was enacted in 1887, stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10 percent in cities where Jews were allowed to live, 5 percent in other cities, and only 3 percent in Moscow and St. Petersburg. These limitations were removed in the spring of 1917 after the tsar&#x27;s abdication during the early phase of the Russian revolution of 1917–1918 (the so-called February Revolution of 1917); later, in the late 1940s, during the initial phase of the Cold War and the tide of the anti-&quot;rootless cosmopolitan&quot; campaign, a de facto gross discrimination of Jewish applicants was reintroduced in many institutions of higher education in the Soviet Union until Perestroika.

===United States===

Certain private universities, most notably Harvard, introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of Jews admitted to the university. Abbott Lawrence Lowell, the president of Harvard University from 1909 to 1933, raised the alarm about a ‘Jewish problem’ when the number of Jewish students grew from six percent to twenty-two percent between 1908 and 1922. Lowell argued that a &quot;limit be placed on the number of them who later be admitted to the university.&quot; The implementation of a quota on the number of Jews was not unique to Harvard. After Harvard’s 1926 announcement about instating a &quot;new admissions policy [that] would place great emphasis on character and personality, the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; praised its decision and put forward its own version of how Yale should select its students in a major editorial, ‘Ellis Island for Yale.’ It called on the university to institute immigration laws more prohibitive than those of the United States government.&quot; According to historian David Oshinsky, writing about Jonas Salk, &quot;Most of the surrounding medical schools (Cornell, Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale) had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501. About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in.&quot; He notes that Dean Milton Winternitz&#x27;s instructions were remarkably precise: &quot;Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all.&quot; As a result, Oshinsky added, &quot;Jonas Salk and hundreds like him&quot; enrolled in New York University instead. Physicist and Nobel laureate Richard P. Feynman was turned away from Columbia College in the 1930s and went to MIT instead.

According to Dan Oren&#x27;s book, &quot;Joining the Club — A History of Jews and Yale&quot;, Yale University&#x27;s informal admissions policy to restrict the school&#x27;s Jewish student body to around 10 percent ended in the early 1960s.

===Yugoslavia===

In 1940, the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia enacted the Decree on the Enrollment of Persons of Jewish Descent at the University, Secondary School, Teacher Training College and Other Vocational Schools which limited the proportion of Jewish students to the proportion of Jews in the total population.

<text>King Gogukcheon (died 197, r. 179–197) was the ninth monarch of Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. According to Samguk sagi, King Gogukcheon&#x27;s height was recorded as 9 chi.

==Family==
*Father: King Sindae ()
*Consort: &quot;Queen&quot;, of the U clan (); daughter of U So () – No issue.

== Background and reign==
Gogukcheon was the second son of Goguryeo&#x27;s eighth king, Sindae. Though his older brother, Go Balgi (), was originally the crown prince, the court officials supported Gogukcheon, who was made crown prince in 176.

However, this record is an error caused by Kim Busik&#x27;s erroneous quotation of 《Tongdian》, who thought that I-imo was the same person as King Gogukcheon, and the established theory in the Korean history academia is that King Gogukcheon&#x27;s older brother Gobalgi[拔奇] and King Sansang&#x27;s older brother Gobalgi[發岐] are the same person. And it is believed in the Korean history academia that King Gogukcheon was not the second son of King Sindae, but the first son of King Sindae.

In 180, Gogukcheon married Lady U, the daughter of U So of the Jena-bu, further consolidating central power. Lady U remained queen after her husband&#x27;s death due to her marriage with Gogukcheon&#x27;s brother and subsequent king Sansang. During his reign, the names of five &#x27;bu&#x27;, or powerful regional clans, become names of districts of the central kingdom, and rebellions by the aristocracy were suppressed, notably in 191.

In 184, Gogukcheon sent his younger brother, Prince Gye-su to fight the Chinese Han dynasty invasion force of the governor of Liaodong. Though Prince Gye-Su was able to block the army, the king later directly led his armies to repel Han forces in 184. In 191, King Gogukcheon adopted a meritocratic system for selecting government officials. As a result, he discovered many talented people from all over Goguryeo, the greatest of them being Ŭl P&#x27;a-so, who was given the position of Prime Minister.

The ancient text &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; says that Gogukcheon went hunting one day in 194 and encountered a starving village. He gave some of his clothes and food to one of the villagers, and felt that the starvation of his people was his responsibility. Gogukcheon worked to improve the lives of farmers and peasants in his kingdom. &quot;Jindae&quot; law is a grain loan system enacted by Gogukcheon in 194. This system allowed people to borrow grain from March to July and pay back in October. This system was maintained by the age of Joseon dynasty as &quot;Hwangok&quot;, which indicates the law was highly preserved more than a thousand years.

== Death and succession ==
Though Gogukcheon&#x27;s ascension signaled a change from fraternal succession to father-son succession by primogeniture, he was succeeded by his brother Sansang. Gogukcheon&#x27;s posthumous name was derived from his burial area, Gogukcheon-won (故國川原,고국천원).

<text>Hautefort (; ) is a commune in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.

It was part of the former province of Périgord.

==History==
The ancient fortress dates back to the early Middle Ages, as proved by the first document quoting its existence as early as 987. A house of Gouffier de Lastours, who won fame during the First Crusade, the castle then became the seigneurial home of the troubadour Bertran de Born, who was viscount of Hautefort.

<doc id="1119806" wikidata="Q226738" url="?curid=1119806" title="Princess Zorka of Montenegro">
<text>Princess Zorka Karađorđević (Serbian Cyrillic: Кнегиња црногорска Зорка; 23 December O.S. 11 December] 1864 – 16 March O.S. 4 March] 1890), born Princess Ljubica of Montenegro, was the eldest child of Prince Nicholas I and Princess Milena of Montenegro, who later became the country&#x27;s king and queen consort. In 1883, Ljubica married Prince Peter Karađorđević and she changed her name to Zorka (and her surname to Karađorđević). She died in childbirth while giving birth to Prince Andrija on 16 March 1890. Prince Andrija died shortly thereafter. Zorka&#x27;s husband later became king of Serbia as Peter I.

==Life==
Born in Cetinje, Montenegro, at the time when her father was already the reigning Prince of Montenegro (his uncle Danilo II Petrović-Njegoš having died in 1860). She had eight younger sisters and three younger brothers. Zorka was educated in Russia before returning to Montenegro to be engaged to Petar Karađorđević. She spent her childhood up to the age of 11 in Cetinje, where she was educated by Cetinje teachers and a Swiss teacher Mrs. Nykom. In 1875, Princess Zorka was sent to Russia to continue her education at the Smolny Institute (attended by the girls from the most prominent Russian aristocratic families). After graduation, she returned to Cetinje. At the beginning of 1883, Prince Petar Karadjordjevic came to Cetinje. His intention was to marry in Cetinje, get closer to the Montenegrins and move there to live with his family. He asked for the hand of the young and beautiful Princess. The arrival of Petar Karadjordjevic in Cetinje and his engagement with Kneginja Zorka Petrovic-Njegos were disapproved by the opponents of these two dynasties, but the act was gladly accepted by the Serbian and Montenegrin people, who saw it as the confirmation of their future bond. The wedding of Princess Zorka (19 at the time) and Petar Karadjordjevic (39) took place at the Cetinje Monastery on 30 July 1883. The wedding party, like the engagement before it, was organized according to folk tradition, with many guests who could barely accommodate themselves in the small space of Cetinje.

Zorka&#x27;s sister Elena married the future King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.

==Marriage and children==
Described as &quot;exuberant&quot; by one commentator, Zorka married Peter in Cetinje on 11 August 1883 in an Orthodox ceremony.

They had five children:
* Princess Helen of Serbia (4 November 1884 – 16 October 1962).
* Princess Milena of Serbia (28 April 1886 – 21 December 1887).
* George, Crown Prince of Serbia (8 September 1887 – 17 October 1972).
* Alexander I of Yugoslavia (16 December 1888 – 9 October 1934).
* Prince Andrew of Serbia (born and died 16 March 1890).

==Death==
Zorka died aged just 25 on 16 March 1890 in Cetinje during childbirth and was buried in the St. George&#x27;s Church in Topola, Serbia.

==Monument==
The first monument for a woman in Serbia was erected for Zorka on 3 June 1926. The monument, a work of sculptor Stamenko Đurđević, was funded by the Duchess Zorka Society and was located on the Big Kalemegdan. The monument was removed and probably destroyed after World War II. The gypsum model of the monument has survived and is housed in the History Museum of Serbia.

<doc id="1119807" wikidata="Q4337567" url="?curid=1119807" title="Tony Campolo">
<text>Anthony Campolo Jr. (February 25, 1935 – November 19, 2024) was an American sociologist, Baptist pastor, author, public speaker, and spiritual advisor to U.S. President Bill Clinton. Campolo was an influential leader in the evangelical left. Campolo was a popular commentator on religious, political, and social issues, and had been a guest on programs such as &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; and &quot;The Hour&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Campolo was born to an Italian-American family in Philadelphia on February 25, 1935. He studied at Eastern College and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1956. He was ordained a Baptist pastor in 1957. He also studied theology at Palmer Theological Seminary and obtained a Bachelor of Divinity in 1960 and a Master of Divinity in 1961. He studied sociology in Temple University and obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in 1968.

==Career==
In 1964, Campolo became professor of sociology at Eastern University in St. David&#x27;s, Pennsylvania. For ten years, he also taught at the University of Pennsylvania.

He became an associate pastor of the Mount Carmel Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, which is affiliated with both the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and the American Baptist Churches USA.

In 1969, he founded the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education (EAPE), which works to help &quot;at-risk&quot; youth in the U.S. and Canada, and has helped to establish several schools and universities.

In 1976, Campolo ran as the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 5th district, but lost to incumbent Republican Dick Schulze.

Campolo was the subject of an informal heresy hearing in 1985 brought about by several assertions in his 1983 book &quot;A Reasonable Faith&quot;, particularly his claim that, &quot;Jesus is actually present in each other person&quot;. The book became a hot button issue, and caused Campus Crusade for Christ and Youth for Christ to block a planned speaking engagement by Campolo. The Christian Legal Society empowered a &quot;reconciliation panel&quot;, led by noted theologian J. I. Packer, to examine the issue and resolve the issue. The panel examined the book and questioned Campolo. The panel issued a statement saying that although it found Campolo&#x27;s statements &quot;methodologically naïve and verbally incautious&quot;, it did not find them to be heretical.

In 1998, he became a spiritual adviser to President Bill Clinton.

In 2007, with Shane Claiborne, he founded Red-Letter Christians, with the aim of bringing together evangelicals who believe in the importance of insisting on issues of social justice mentioned by Jesus (in red in some translations of the Bible). He also became a leader of the Red-Letter Christian movement, which aims to put emphasis on the teachings of Jesus.

In March 2011, Campolo began hosting the TV show &quot;Red Letter Christians&quot;, aired on JC-TV. This weekly half-hour talk show features interviews with leaders in the Red-Letter Christian movement.

On January 14, 2014, Campolo announced his plans to retire from leading the EAPE and to close that ministry, the extra money in the ministry being distributed to offshoot ministries started by EAPE.

==Views on religion and politics==
Although Campolo associated himself with the Democratic Party and several other modern liberal groups and causes, he publicly stated his opposition to abortion. Campolo held a consistent life ethic stance in opposition to any human situation that leads to the termination of life including warfare, poverty/starvation (as caused by extreme wealth inequalities), capital punishment, and euthanasia.

Starting in the late 1980s, Campolo&#x27;s left-leaning political beliefs began to put leaders of the Christian right, such as Gary Bauer and Jerry Falwell, at odds with him. Despite his criticisms of political conservatives in the evangelical community, Campolo also criticized the more liberal mainline Christian denominations.

Along with his wife, Peggy Campolo, he participated in very public debates and discussions about the place of lesbians and gays within church and society. Campolo formerly contended that homosexuality was a sin in practice, although not in orientation, while his wife disagreed, holding that committed, monogamous homosexual practice was not a sin; she supports full equality for LGBT people. Regarding marriage, he stated that all couples should have the right to a civil union with all the legal rights that are associated with such a contract.

On June 8, 2015, Campolo released a statement changing his position on the issue of gay relationships, and stating that he now supported full acceptance of Christian gay couples into the Church. He cited several reasons including the institution of marriage primarily being about spiritual growth instead of procreation, what he had learned through his friendships with gay Christian couples, and past examples of exclusionary church traditions practiced &quot;by sincere believers, but most of us now agree that they were wrong.&quot;

Campolo offered the benediction on the second night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, including in his prayer &quot;We are a nation that needs healing. Break down the barriers of race and ethnicity that separate us. Cure the sexism and homophobia that denies the dignity of so many of our fellow Americans. Help us to overcome our fears of refugees and show us how to love our enemies and overcome evil with good.&quot;

In 2018, he participated in a &quot;Red Letter Revival&quot; in Lynchburg, Virginia, intended to highlight the connection between Evangelical Christianity and concern for social justice. Describing the Red-Letter Christian movement that organized that revival, he said:

&quot;We want to be people of Jesus. That does have political implications. You can&#x27;t go to the New Testament without sensing Jesus&#x27; commitment to the poor. … We basically see ourselves as committed to them. And that list in the 25th chapter of Matthew talks about welcoming the alien. Those aligning with Donald Trump are aligning with an anti-refugee mindset. We feel if we are reading the scriptures honestly, we are to receive the alien. I guess we are progressive in the sense that … we are opposed to the view of women that puts them in a submissive position. We are saying we don&#x27;t really buy that. … I can understand why we are called &quot;progressive evangelicals&quot; because we stand over and against the kind of reactionary points of view that are being established by evangelicals across the country.&quot;

==Personal life==
Campolo married Peggy Davidson on June 7, 1958. Their daughter was born in 1960 and their son was born in 1963. His son, Bart Campolo, is a former evangelical preacher who left Christianity and transitioned to secular humanism. The two engaged in an ongoing conversation since Bart announced to him that he no longer believed in God. They co-authored a book exploring the issues at the heart of this conversation, and a documentary film (&quot;Leaving My Father&#x27;s Faith&quot;) was released in 2018 which features the conversations between them and tell the story of Bart&#x27;s journey out of faith. 

===Illness and death===
In June 2020, Campolo had a stroke which left him partially paralyzed. He died from heart failure at his home in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, on November 19, 2024, at the age of 89.

<text>Thomas Danforth (baptized November 20, 1623 – November 5, 1699) was a politician, magistrate, and landowner in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. A conservative Puritan, he served for many years as one of the colony&#x27;s councilors and magistrates, generally leading opposition to attempts by the English kings to assert control over the colony.

He accumulated land in the central part of the colony that eventually became a portion of Framingham, Massachusetts. His government roles included administration of territory in present-day Maine that was purchased by the colony.

Danforth was a magistrate and leading figure in the colony at the time of the Salem witch trials, but did not sit on the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Despite this, he is inaccurately depicted in Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1953 play &quot;The Crucible&quot; and its movie adaptations as doing so. In reality, Danforth is recorded as being critical of the conduct of the trials, and played a role in bringing them to an end.

==Early life==
Thomas Danforth was born in Framlingham, Suffolk, England, and baptized on November 20, 1623. He was the eldest son of Nicholas Danforth (1589–1638) and Elizabeth Symmes (1596–1629). Danforth immigrated with his father, brothers Samuel and Jonathan, and sisters Anna, Elizabeth, and Lydia to New England in 1634, probably aboard the &quot;Griffin&quot;. 

The family, along with the 200 or so other passengers aboard, left England to escape persecution for their Puritan beliefs. William Laud had become archbishop of the Church of England in 1633 and begun a crackdown on Nonconformist religious practices (such as those practiced by the more Calvinist Puritans) that prompted a wave of migration to the New World.

==Public service==

Soon after his arrival in the Massachusetts Bay Colony Nicholas Danforth acquired property in Cambridge, becoming one of the town&#x27;s leading citizens and a member of the colony&#x27;s general court (as its assembly was known). He died in 1638, leaving his lands and the care of his younger children to Thomas. In 1643 Danforth was admitted a freeman of the colony, which conferred on him the right to vote and to participate in the colony&#x27;s political affairs.

He was appointed Treasurer of Harvard College in its charter of 1650, and served as a steward of the college from 1669 to 1682. From 1659 he sat on the colony&#x27;s council of assistants, and was elected deputy governor in 1679. In 1665 Danforth was member of a commission that oversaw the extension of Massachusetts colonial authority over the territories of what is now southern Maine, which colonial surveyors had determined to fall within its borders.

Danforth&#x27;s politics and religion were relatively conservative, with one historian describing him as &quot;the Pym of Massachusetts politics&quot;. In 1661 the colony was rebuked by King Charles II for its mistreatment of Quakers; the colonial government had banned Quakers from its territory under threat of death, and four of them had recently been hanged after repeatedly violating the ban. The king in his letter demanded that the colony allow Quakers and others freedom of religious expression. 

Danforth was one member of a committee that was established to formulate a response. The document the committee drafted was a conservative declaration that the colonial government was essentially sovereign except where its laws conflicted with English law. (By the time the king&#x27;s letter arrived the colonial government had already lessened the harsh punishments for violating bans.) Two committee members, magistrate Simon Bradstreet and minister John Norton, were sent to England to argue the colony&#x27;s case.

When King Philip&#x27;s War broke out in 1675 (pitting many Native American tribes of southern New England against English colonists), Danforth was involved in some of the events of the war. Many colonists distrusted the Praying Indians (Christianized Indians living peacefully in communities on the outskirts of English towns), some of whom were attacked by mobs of English settlers seeking revenge for attacks on their communities. Danforth, along with Daniel Gookin and the Indian missionary Reverend John Eliot, was a vocal supporter of the Praying Indians, and worked to prevent some of these excesses, at some personal risk. In one notable instance Danforth was aboard a small boat with other colonial officials in Boston Harbor en route to Long Island to inspect facilities for Praying Indians who had been relocated there &quot;for their own safety&quot; when a nearby ship apparently intentionally rammed the smaller vessel. No one was injured in the incident, but all of the older officials were dunked in the cold waters of the harbor.

In 1680 Danforth was chosen president in the District of Maine by the Massachusetts assembly. The colony had previously governed this territory (roughly the land between the Piscataqua and Kennebec Rivers in what is now southwestern Maine), but its right to do so had been stripped by King Charles after protests by the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who had long-standing claims to the area. Agents for Massachusetts then purchased the territory from the Gorges heirs, and Danforth was appointed to administer it. The territory had been devastated and many properties abandoned during King Philip&#x27;s War, and Danforth acted in effect as a Lord Proprietor, making land grants and reestablishing towns such as Falmouth and North Yarmouth. Danforth was rewarded by the colony with a grant of an island in Casco Bay for this work, which he oversaw until 1686.

Throughout the 1670s, the Massachusetts leadership steadfastly refused to make changes to its administration that were demanded by King Charles. At the instigation of agent Edward Randolph, Charles made increasingly specific demands concerning freedom of religion and adherence to colonial trade regulations known as the Navigation Acts, and prepared to issue a &quot;quo warranto&quot; writ to demand the return of the colonial charter. Danforth was one of the leading opponents to making any accommodation to the king&#x27;s demands. 

The issue reached a peak in the 1684 election, in which Danforth stood for election as governor representing the hardline party. He was narrowly defeated by the more conciliatory Simon Bradstreet, but retained the post of deputy governor. The colony&#x27;s attempts at moderation were in vain—the charter was formally annulled on June 18, 1684.

In 1686 King James II established the Dominion of New England as a new colonial entity to govern all of New England. He appointed Massachusetts native Joseph Dudley as its first governor; he was replaced later that year by Sir Edmund Andros. Both Dudley and Andros excluded Danforth from their councils, given his opposition to crown authority. The dominion reign, which did not include an elected assembly, was extremely unpopular in Massachusetts for a variety of reasons. When the Glorious Revolution deposed James, Massachusetts Puritan leaders orchestrated an uprising and arrested Andros, Dudley, and other dominion officials. In the period between the dominion&#x27;s collapse and the establishment of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692, the old colonial government was temporarily reestablished, and Danforth resumed his offices.

===Salem trials===

In 1692, Danforth was acting governor during the early months of the witch hysteria in Salem and his name appears once in the Salem court records as part of a council which observed the proceedings on April 11. but his involvement ended in May upon the arrival of Sir William Phips, the first royal governor under the new charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Danforth was not assigned to the special Court of Oyer and Terminer that Phips established shortly thereafter, and he was opposed to the manner in which magistrate William Stoughton conducted the witch trials, which unconditionally accepted spectral evidence in its proceedings and vigorously presumed the guilt of the accused. In a letter by Thomas Brattle on October 8, 1692, Danforth is described as among a select group of &quot;several about the Bay, men for understanding, judgement and piety... that do utterly condemn the said proceedings, and do freely deliver their judgment...&quot;

After the Court of Oyer and Terminer stopped sitting, a new Superior Court was created, and, in December 1692, Stoughton was elected by the governor&#x27;s council to head the court, defeating Danforth by three votes. 

In the beginning of 1693, Danforth participated in Superior Court sessions overseen by Stoughton, which heard witchcraft cases. However, these sessions no longer considered spectral evidence as valid. When Stoughton temporarily removed himself to protest Governor Phips&#x27; ban on spectral evidence and other related reforms, Danforth sometimes presided over the court.

Danforth was known to be sympathetic to the plight of individuals accused, relocating some of them to his lands west of Boston in Framingham.

Sarah Cloyce, a woman accused during the Salem witch trials, relocated with her husband to a property owned by Danforth and settled into a house on Salem End Road constructed in 1693. In 1992, The Boston Globe published a historian&#x27;s suggestion that Danforth might have facilitated Cloyce&#x27;s escape from Ipswich jail and subsequently concealed her family on his property.

==Family and property==
Danforth married Mary Withington in 1644. The couple had 12 children, but half of these died before the age of three. Danforth was survived by only three of the others. Danforth died in Cambridge on November 5, 1699. During his lifetime, Danforth owned an enslaved man named Philip Ffeild.
In 1662 Danforth began to acquire land to the west of Boston by way of land grants by the Great and General Court after general surveys conducted by Edmund Rice at the behest of the Court. Originally known as &quot;Danforth&#x27;s Farm&quot;, he began to refer to the estate as &quot;Framingham&quot; in the 1670s in honor of his birthplace. Although Danforth continued to reside in Cambridge, he developed these lands, which came to number , by issuing 999 year leases rather than selling parcels. By the 1690s a number of somewhat discontiguous communities existed on the land, which petitioned the state for incorporation. Objections were made to the earliest petition (of 1692) by Danforth, since it did not include all of his lands, and a number of subsequent petitions were objected to by neighboring communities. It was not until 1700, after Danforth had died, that the town of Framingham was granted a charter. The town&#x27;s seal contains the words &quot;Danforth&#x27;s Farms&quot; in commemoration of this heritage.

Danforth, Maine is named in his honor. The Danforth Art Museum, founded in 1975, is located in Framingham.

== Legacy ==
Danforth Street, in Portland, Maine, is now named for him.

==Fictional character in &quot;The Crucible&quot;==
In Arthur Miller&#x27;s 1953 play &quot;The Crucible,&quot; Thomas Danforth is depicted as the leading judicial figure overseeing the Salem trials. William Stoughton is not a character in the play, and Miller portrays Danforth as an honest but domineering and selfish judge, under whose authority many are imprisoned and sentenced to hang. When John Proctor, an accused, defies his authority at the end of the play by refusing to lie and sign a public confession saying that he is a wizard and accusing others, he is mercilessly sentenced to hang.

In an introduction to the play, Miller wrote that he had combined several persons and made other changes to the historical characters for dramatic purposes.

Miller also wrote the screenplay for the 1996 film version of the play, in which the name Danforth was retained (portrayed by actor Paul Scofield) as the principal judicial antagonist. In the 1957 film adaptation of the play, whose screenplay was written by Jean-Paul Sartre, Danforth (portrayed by Raymond Rouleau, who also directed the picture) is portrayed the same way.

<text>In pyrotechnics, black match is a type of crude fuse, constructed of cotton string fibers intimately coated with a dried black powder slurry.

When black match is confined in a paper tube, called quick match or piped match, the flame front propagates much more quickly, many feet per second.

Quick match is often used in model rockets in the United Kingdom to ignite multiple engines/motors; it is however largely unavailable in the USA due to ambiguous explosives laws.

<text>For Squirrels was an American alternative rock band based in Gainesville, Florida, United States, founded in 1992.

Their 1995 single &quot;Mighty K.C.&quot; became an alternative rock radio hit about three months after a touring van accident that claimed the lives of founding members Jack Vigliatura IV and Bill White, along with tour manager Tim Bender, while the band was on the cusp of national recognition.

The surviving members of the band changed the name to Subrosa in 1996 before disbanding in 2001.

==History==
===Classic lineup (1992–1995)===
The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted of vocalist Vigliatura, bassist White, guitarist Travis Tooke, and drummer Jay Russell. Explaining their name, the band had said that they were so committed to being in a band, they would play music &quot;for squirrels.&quot; The group played jangly alternative rock akin to R.E.M., one of their prime influences, with heavier moments alluding to the sound of grunge rock and Nirvana.

Drummer Jack Griego eventually replaced Russell. In early 1994, they self-released their first full album, &quot;Baypath Rd.&quot;, followed by the &quot;Plymouth&quot; EP, which simply re-released five songs directly taken from &quot;Baypath Rd&quot;. Steven E. Goldman, a prominent Miami attorney, served as the band&#x27;s manager. After touring and establishing a following, the band signed with Sony/550 Music and recorded the album &quot;Example&quot; with producer Nick Launay (at the time known for working with Midnight Oil, Talking Heads and Kate Bush), which was set to be released on October 3, 1995.

On September 8, 1995, while returning from playing the CMJ Music Marathon in New York City, the band was involved in the auto accident that killed Vigliatura, White, and Bender. Griego and Tooke suffered multiple injuries but survived the crash. The album was released as planned. The single &quot;Mighty K.C.&quot;, about the death of Kurt Cobain, was a minor hit and continued to drive album sales.

===Post-accident (1995-1996)===
A few months after the accident, Tooke and Griego regrouped with school friend Andy Lord on bass and Tooke taking over on vocals. In February 1996, the new lineup began by playing a few low-key shows centered around classic For Squirrels songs and a selection of covers under the pseudonym Revlover. Eventually, they resurrected the For Squirrels moniker and began writing and performing new material, favoring a heavier grunge sound.

===As Subrosa (1996–2001)===
By late 1996, the trio was playing under the name Subrosa. In the summer of 1997, they released their only record under this name, &quot;Never Bet the Devil Your Head&quot;, on Sony Records, to decent reviews but poor sales. A music video was filmed for the track &quot;Buzzard&quot; from the album. Second guitarist Mike Amish was later added, which was followed by a tour supporting popular alternative rock act Creed. Griego eventually parted ways with the group and was replaced in the band&#x27;s final years by Rusty Valentine. They disbanded in 2001.

===Later activity===
Tooke, Lord and Amish have remained active in the Gainesville rock scene. Tooke has performed under several monikers including his most recent music project, Helixglow. He has also released a solo CD and several singles (2012) via Indigo Planet Records. Amish and Lord now play in the band Papercranes.

<doc id="1119831" wikidata="Q1993315" url="?curid=1119831" title="Glass wool">
<text>Glass wool is an insulating material made from glass fiber arranged using a binder into a texture similar to wool. The process traps many small pockets of air between the glass, and these small air pockets result in high thermal insulation properties. Glass wool is produced in rolls or in slabs, with different thermal and mechanical properties. It may also be produced as a material that can be sprayed or applied in place, on the surface to be insulated. The modern method for producing glass wool was invented by Games Slayter while he was working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933.

== Principles of function ==
Gases possess poor thermal conduction properties compared to liquids and solids and thus make good insulation material if they can be trapped in materials so that much of the heat that flows through the material is forced to flow through the gas. In order to further augment the effectiveness of a gas (such as air) it may be disrupted into small cells which cannot effectively transfer heat by natural convection. Natural convection involves a larger bulk flow of gas driven by buoyancy and temperature differences, and it does not work well in small gas cells where there is little density difference to drive it, and the high surface area to volume ratios of the small cells retards bulk gas flow inside them by means of viscous drag.

In order to accomplish the formation of small gas cells in man-made thermal insulation, glass and polymer materials can be used to trap air in a foam-like structure. The same principle used in glass wool is used in other man-made insulators such as rock wool, Styrofoam, wet suit neoprene foam fabrics, and fabrics such as Gore-Tex and polar fleece. The air-trapping property is also the insulation principle used in nature in down feathers and insulating hair such as natural wool.

==Manufacturing process==
Natural sand and recycled glass are mixed and heated to , to produce glass. The fiberglass is usually produced by a method similar to making cotton candy. Molten glass is forced through a rapidly spinning metal cup, called a &#x27;spinner&#x27;. The centrifugal force pulls the glass through small holes in the spinner. The newly created fibers cool on contact with the air. 
Cohesion and mechanical strength are obtained by the presence of a binder that “cements” the fibers together. A drop of binder is placed at each fiber intersection. The fiber mat is then heated to around to polymerize the resin and is calendered to give it strength and stability. Finally, the wool mat is cut and packed in rolls or panels, palletized, and stored for use.

==Uses==
Glass wool is a thermal insulation material consisting of intertwined and flexible glass fibers, which causes it to &quot;package&quot; air, resulting in a low density that can be varied through compression and binder content (as noted above, these air cells are the actual insulator). Glass wool can be a loose-fill material, blown into attics, or together with an active binder, sprayed on the underside of structures, sheets, and panels that can be used to insulate flat surfaces such as cavity wall insulation, ceiling tiles, curtain walls, and ducting. It is also used to insulate piping and for soundproofing.

==Fiberglass batts and blankets==

Batts are precut, whereas blankets are available in continuous rolls. Compressing the material reduces its effectiveness. Cutting it to accommodate electrical boxes and other obstructions allows air a free path to cross through the wall cavity. One can install batts in two layers across an unfinished attic floor, perpendicular to each other, for increased effectiveness at preventing heat bridging. Blankets can cover joists and studs as well as the space between them. Batts can be challenging and unpleasant to hang under floors between joists; straps, or staple cloth or wire mesh across joists, can hold it up.

Gaps between batts (bypasses) can become sites of air infiltration or condensation (both of which reduce the effectiveness of the insulation) and require strict attention during the installation. By the same token careful weatherization and installation of vapour barriers is required to ensure that the batts perform optimally. Air infiltration can be also reduced by adding a layer of cellulose loose-fill on top of the material.

==Health problems==

Fiberglass will irritate the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system. Potential symptoms include irritation of eyes, skin, nose, and throat, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), sore throat, hoarseness and cough. Fiberglass used for insulating appliances appears to produce human disease that is similar to asbestosis. Scientific evidence demonstrates that fiberglass is safe to manufacture, install and use when recommended work practices are followed to reduce temporary mechanical irritation. Unfortunately these work practices are not always followed, and fiberglass is often left exposed in basements that later become occupied. Fiberglass insulation should never be left exposed in an occupied area, according to the American Lung Association.

In June 2011, the United States&#x27; National Toxicology Program (NTP) removed from its Report on Carcinogens all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products. Similarly, California&#x27;s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (&quot;OEHHA&quot;), in November 2011, published a modification to its Proposition 65 listing to include only &quot;Glass wool fibers (inhalable and biopersistent).&quot; The United States&#x27; NTP and California&#x27;s OEHHA action means that a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under Federal or California law. All fiberglass wools commonly used for thermal and acoustical insulation were reclassified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in October 2001 as Not Classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).

Fiberglass itself is resistant to mold. If mold is found in or on fiberglass it is more likely that the binder is the source of the mold, since binders are often organic and more hygroscopic than the glass wool. In tests, glass wool was found to be highly resistant to the growth of mold. Only exceptional circumstances resulted in mold growth: very high relative humidity, 96% and above, or saturated glass wool, although saturated wool glass will only have moderate growth.

<text>Nulji (reigned 417–458) was the nineteenth ruler (&quot;maripgan&quot;) of Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was the son of King Naemul and Lady Boban, who was the daughter of King Michu.

Nulji married the daughter of King Silseong of Silla, who nonetheless exiled Nulji&#x27;s younger brothers as hostages to Goguryeo of northern Korea and as diplomats and influential architects to Wa of Japan. Silseong also plotted to have Nulji killed, but with Goguryeo&#x27;s aid, Nulji was able to kill Silseong in 417, after which he ascended to the throne.

According to one story, in 418 Nulji sent a loyal retainer named to rescue his brothers from Goguryeo and Wa. He was successful in retrieving the brother who was held in Goguryeo, but he was captured while trying to rescue the one held by Wa. Refusing to serve the Wa king, he died under torture. The story of Bak&#x27;s loyalty has endured as a popular Korean morality tale.

After these difficult events, Nulji worked to free Silla from Goguryeo domination. He set up diplomatic relations with Goguryeo on an equal footing in 424, and established a military alliance with Baekje in 433 to help counter the Goguryeo threat. called Beakje-Silla alliance ()

Nulji&#x27;s reign saw the continuation of a long process of centralization in Silla, marked his father&#x27;s change of his title to &quot;maripgan&quot; (), which is believed to represent a higher level of authority than the previous title &quot;isageum&quot; (). Under Nulji&#x27;s rule, patrilineal succession was officially established (Yang, 1999, p. 16). After his death in 458, he was succeeded by his son Jabi, rather than by his brother.

<doc id="1119842" wikidata="Q2066530" url="?curid=1119842" title="William James Linton">
<text>William James Linton (December 7, 1812December 29, 1897) was an English-born American wood-engraver, landscape painter, political reformer and author of memoirs, novels, poetry and non-fiction.

== Birth and early years ==
Born in Mile End, east London, his family moved to Stratford, Essex in 1818. The young Linton was educated at Chigwell Grammar School, an early 17th-century foundation attended by many sons of the Essex and City of London middle classes.

== Early career ==
Aged 15, Linton was apprenticed to the wood-engraver George Wilmot Bonner (1796–1836). His earliest known work is to be found in John Martin and Richard Westall&#x27;s &quot;Pictorial Illustrations of the Bible&quot; (1833). He worked from 1834 to 1836 with William Henry Powis, another pupil of Bonner; but Powis died. Linton then worked for two years for the firm of John Thompson.

After working as a journeyman engraver, losing his money over a cheap political library called the &quot;National,&quot; and writing a life of Thomas Paine, Linton went into partnership in 1842 with John Orrin Smith. The firm was immediately employed on the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, just then projected. The following year Orrin Smith died, and Linton, who had married a sister of Thomas Wade, editor of &quot;Bell&#x27;s Weekly Messenger&quot;, found himself in sole charge of a business upon which two families were dependent.

== Political education and activism ==

For years he had concerned himself with the social and European political problems of the time, and was now actively engaged in the republican propaganda. In 1844 he took a prominent part in exposing the violation by the English post office of Mazzini&#x27;s correspondence. This led to a friendship with the Italian revolutionist, and Linton threw himself with ardor into European politics. He carried the first congratulatory address of English workmen to the French Provisional Government in 1848. He edited a twopenny weekly paper, &quot;The Cause of the People&quot;, published in the Isle of Man, and he wrote political verses for the &quot;Dublin Nation&quot;, signed &quot;Spartacus.&quot; He helped to found the &quot;International League&quot; of patriots, and, in 1850, with George Henry Lewes and Thornton Leigh Hunt, started &quot;The Leader&quot;, an organ which, however, did not satisfy his advanced republicanism, and from which he soon withdrew.

The same year he wrote a series of articles propounding the views of Mazzini in &quot;The Red Republican&quot;. In 1852 he took up his residence at Brantwood, which afterward he sold to John Ruskin, and from there issued &quot;The English Republic&quot;, first in the form of weekly tracts and afterward as a monthly magazine &quot;a useful exponent of republican principles, a faithful record ef republican progress throughout the world; an organ of propagandism and a medium of communication for the active republicans in England.&quot; Most of the paper, which never paid its way and was abandoned in 1855, was written by himself.

In 1852 he also printed for private circulation an anonymous volume of poems entitled &quot;The Plaint of Freedom&quot;. After the failure of his paper he returned to his proper work of wood-engraving. In 1857 his wife died, and in the following year he married Eliza Lynn (afterward known as Mrs Lynn Linton) and returned to London. The couple moved to Gang Moor on the north-western extremity of Hampstead Heath in 1862. In 1864 he retired to Brantwood, his wife remaining in London.

== Emigration to the US ==
In 1867, pressed by financial difficulties, Linton decided to try his fortune in America. He separated from his wife, with whom, however, he remained in touch. With his children he settled at Appledore, Hamden, Connecticut, where he set up a printing-press.

At Hamden Linton he wrote &quot;Practical Hints on Wood-Engraving&quot; (1879), &quot;James Watson, a Memoir of Chartist Times&quot; (1879), &quot;A History of Wood-Engraving in America&quot; (1882), &quot;Wood-Engraving, a Manual of Instruction&quot; (1884), &quot;The Masters of Wood-Engraving&quot;, for which he made two journeys to England (1890), &quot;The Life of Whittier&quot; (1893), and &quot;Memories&quot;, an autobiography (1895). He died at Hamden on 29 December 1897.

== Legacy ==
Linton was a singularly gifted man, who, in the words of his wife, if he had not bitten the Dead Sea apple of impracticable politics, would have risen higher in the world of both art and letters. As an engraver on wood he reached the highest point of execution in his own line. He carried on the tradition of Bewick, fought for intelligent as against merely manipulative excellence in the use of the graver, and championed the use of the &quot;white line&quot; as well as of the black, believing with Ruskin that the former was the truer and more telling basis of aesthetic expression in the wood-block printed upon paper.

<text>is a Japanese aristocratic kin group. The Takatsukasa was a branch of the Fujiwara clan and one of the Five regent houses, from which Sesshō and Kampaku could be chosen.

The family crest of Takatsukasa is peony.

==History==
The Takatsukasa family was founded by Fujiwara no Kanehira (1228-1294), who was the sixth son of Konoe Iezane; he was also the first to take this family name, named after the section of Kyoto in which the household resided. The Takatsukasa family, for the first time, died out in the Sengoku period following the death of Tadafuyu, 13th head of the family, in 1546. Later in 1579, with the assistance of Oda Nobunaga, the third son of Nijō Haruyoshi took the name Takatsukasa Nobufusa and revived the household. Nobufusa&#x27;s daughter Takako married Iemitsu, the third Tokugawa shōgun.

In 1884, Hiromichi, the head of the Takatsukasa family, became a prince in the kazoku system. In 1950, Princess Kazuko, the third daughter of Hirohito (the Emperor Showa) married Toshimichi Takatsukasa, but the couple had no children.

==Family Tree==
===First Creation (1252-1546)===










===Second Creation (1579-present)===













===Takatsukasa-Matsudaira (Yoshii) family===
The was a cadet branch of both Takatsukasa and the Kishū-Tokugawa family, founded by , the youngest son of Takatsukasa Nobufusa. Because of his sister&#x27;s marriage to the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu since 1623, Nobuhira moved to Edo in 1650; Iemitsu welcomed his brother-in-law and granted him the rank hatamoto. Arranged by Iemitsu&#x27;s successor Tokugawa Ietsuna, in 1653, Nobuhira married Matsuhime, the second daughter of Tokugawa Yorinobu; as a close relative of the Tokugawa clan, Nobuhira was later allowed to adopt the family name Matsudaira by the next year. During the era of Meiji, the family name was changed to Yoshii (吉井), named after the family&#x27;s fief Yoshii Domain in Edo Period.

<text>Dangling pointers and wild pointers in computer programming are pointers that do not point to a valid object of the appropriate type. These are special cases of memory safety violations. More generally, dangling references and wild references are references that do not resolve to a valid destination.

Dangling pointers arise during object destruction, when an object that has an incoming reference is deleted or deallocated, without modifying the value of the pointer, so that the pointer still points to the memory location of the deallocated memory. The system may reallocate the previously freed memory, and if the program then dereferences the (now) dangling pointer, &quot;unpredictable behavior may result&quot;, as the memory may now contain completely different data. If the program writes to memory referenced by a dangling pointer, a silent corruption of unrelated data may result, leading to subtle bugs that can be extremely difficult to find. If the memory has been reallocated to another process, then attempting to dereference the dangling pointer can cause segmentation faults (UNIX, Linux) or general protection faults (Windows). If the program has sufficient privileges to allow it to overwrite the bookkeeping data used by the kernel&#x27;s memory allocator, the corruption can cause system instabilities. In object-oriented languages with garbage collection, dangling references are prevented by only destroying objects that are unreachable, meaning they do not have any incoming pointers; this is ensured either by tracing or reference counting. However, a finalizer may create new references to an object, requiring object resurrection to prevent a dangling reference.

Wild pointers, also called uninitialized pointers, arise when a pointer is used prior to initialization to some known state, which is possible in some programming languages. They show the same erratic behavior as dangling pointers, though they are less likely to stay undetected because many compilers will raise a warning at compile time if declared variables are accessed before being initialized.

==Cause of dangling pointers==

In many languages (e.g., the C programming language) deleting an object from memory explicitly or by destroying the stack frame on return does not alter associated pointers. The pointer still points to the same location in memory even though that location may now be used for other purposes.

A straightforward example is shown below:
 char *dp = NULL;
 {
 char c;
 dp = &amp;c;
 /* c falls out of scope */
 /* dp is now a dangling pointer */

If the operating system is able to detect run-time references to null pointers, a solution to the above is to assign 0 (null) to dp immediately before the inner block is exited. Another solution would be to somehow guarantee dp is not used again without further initialization.

Another frequent source of dangling pointers is a jumbled combination of codice_1 and codice_2 library calls: a pointer becomes dangling when the block of memory it points to is freed. As with the previous example one way to avoid this is to make sure to reset the pointer to null after freeing its reference—as demonstrated below.

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void func()
 char *dp = malloc(A_CONST);
 free(dp); /* dp now becomes a dangling pointer */
 dp = NULL; /* dp is no longer dangling */
}

An all too common misstep is returning addresses of a stack-allocated local variable: once a called function returns, the space for these variables gets deallocated and technically they have &quot;garbage values&quot;.

int *func(void)
 int num = 1234;
 return &amp;num;

Attempts to read from the pointer may still return the correct value (1234) for a while after calling codice_3, but any functions called thereafter may overwrite the stack storage allocated for codice_4 with other values and the pointer would no longer work correctly. If a pointer to codice_4 must be returned, codice_4 must have scope beyond the function—it might be declared as codice_7.

==Manual deallocation without dangling reference==
 (1945–1996) has created a complete object management system which is free of dangling reference phenomenon. A similar approach was proposed by Fisher and LeBlanc under the name &quot;Locks-and-keys&quot;.

==Cause of wild pointers==

Wild pointers are created by omitting necessary initialization prior to first use. Thus, strictly speaking, every pointer in programming languages which do not enforce initialization begins as a wild pointer.

This most often occurs due to jumping over the initialization, not by omitting it. Most compilers are able to warn about this.
int f(int i)
 char *dp; /* dp is a wild pointer */
 static char *scp; /* scp is not a wild pointer:
 * static variables are initialized to 0
 * at start and retain their values from
 * the last call afterwards.
 * Using this feature may be considered bad
 * style if not commented */


==Security holes involving dangling pointers==

Like buffer-overflow bugs, dangling/wild pointer bugs frequently become security holes. For example, if the pointer is used to make a virtual function call, a different address (possibly pointing at exploit code) may be called due to the vtable pointer being overwritten. Alternatively, if the pointer is used for writing to memory, some other data structure may be corrupted. Even if the memory is only read once the pointer becomes dangling, it can lead to information leaks (if interesting data is put in the next structure allocated there) or to privilege escalation (if the now-invalid memory is used in security checks). When a dangling pointer is used after it has been freed without allocating a new chunk of memory to it, this becomes known as a &quot;use after free&quot; vulnerability. For example, is a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 11 being used by zero-day attacks by an advanced persistent threat.

==Avoiding dangling pointer errors==

In C, the simplest technique is to implement an alternative version of the codice_2 (or alike) function which guarantees the reset of the pointer. However, this technique will not clear other pointer variables which may contain a copy of the pointer.
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

/* Alternative version for &#x27;free()&#x27; */
static void safefree(void **pp)
 /* in debug mode, abort if pp is NULL */
 assert(pp);
 /* free(NULL) works properly, so no check is required besides the assert in debug mode */
 free(*pp); /* deallocate chunk, note that free(NULL) is valid */
 *pp = NULL; /* reset original pointer */

int f(int i)
 char *p = NULL, *p2;
 p = malloc(1000); /* get a chunk */
 p2 = p; /* copy the pointer */
 /* use the chunk here */
 safefree((void **)&amp;p); /* safety freeing; does not affect p2 variable */
 safefree((void **)&amp;p); /* this second call won&#x27;t fail as p is reset to NULL */
 char c = *p2; /* p2 is still a dangling pointer, so this is undefined behavior. */
 return i + c;


The alternative version can be used even to guarantee the validity of an empty pointer before calling codice_1:
safefree(&amp;p); /* I&#x27;m not sure if chunk has been released */
p = malloc(1000); /* allocate now */
These uses can be masked through codice_10 directives to construct useful macros (a common one being codice_11), creating something like a metalanguage or can be embedded into a tool library apart. In every case, programmers using this technique should use the safe versions in every instance where codice_2 would be used; failing in doing so leads again to the problem. Also, this solution is limited to the scope of a single program or project, and should be properly documented.

Among more structured solutions, a popular technique to avoid dangling pointers in C++ is to use smart pointers. A smart pointer typically uses reference counting to reclaim objects. Some other techniques include the tombstones method and the locks-and-keys method.

Another approach is to use the Boehm garbage collector, a conservative garbage collector that replaces standard memory allocation functions in C and C++ with a garbage collector. This approach completely eliminates dangling pointer errors by disabling frees, and reclaiming objects by garbage collection.

Another approach is to use a system system such as CHERI, which stores pointers with additional metadata which may prevent invalid accesses by including lifetime information in pointers. CHERI typically requires support in the CPU to conduct these additional checks.

In languages like Java, dangling pointers cannot occur because there is no mechanism to explicitly deallocate memory. Rather, the garbage collector may deallocate memory, but only when the object is no longer reachable from any references.

In the language Rust, the type system has been extended to include also the variables lifetimes and resource acquisition is initialization. Unless one disables the features of the language, dangling pointers will be caught at compile time and reported as programming errors.

==Dangling pointer detection==

To expose dangling pointer errors, one common programming technique is to set pointers to the null pointer or to an invalid address once the storage they point to has been released. When the null pointer is dereferenced (in most languages) the program will immediately terminate—there is no potential for data corruption or unpredictable behavior. This makes the underlying programming mistake easier to find and resolve. This technique does not help when there are multiple copies of the pointer.

Some debuggers will automatically overwrite and destroy data that has been freed, usually with a specific pattern, such as codice_13 (Microsoft&#x27;s Visual C/C++ debugger, for example, uses codice_14, codice_15 or codice_16 depending on what has been freed). This usually prevents the data from being reused by making it useless and also very prominent (the pattern serves to show the programmer that the memory has already been freed).

Tools such as Polyspace, TotalView, Valgrind, Mudflap, AddressSanitizer, or tools based on LLVM can also be used to detect uses of dangling pointers.

Other tools (SoftBound, Insure++, and CheckPointer) instrument the source code to collect and track legitimate values for pointers (&quot;metadata&quot;) and check each pointer access against the metadata for validity.

Another strategy, when suspecting a small set of classes, is to temporarily make all their member functions virtual: after the class instance has been destructed/freed, its pointer to the Virtual Method Table is set to codice_17, and any call to a member function will crash the program and it will show the guilty code in the debugger.

<text>Thomas Carr Frank (born March 21, 1965) is an American political analyst, historian, and journalist. He co-founded and edited &quot;The Baffler&quot; magazine. Frank is the author of the books &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Kansas?&quot; (2004) and &quot;Listen, Liberal&quot; (2016), among others. From 2008 to 2010 he wrote &quot;The Tilting Yard&quot;, a column in &quot;The Wall Street Journal.&quot;

A historian of culture and ideas, Frank analyzes trends in American electoral politics and propaganda, advertising, popular culture, mainstream journalism, and economics. His topics include the rhetoric and impact of culture wars in American political life and the relationship between politics, economics, and culture in the United States.

==Early life==
Frank was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and grew up in Mission Hills, Kansas. He graduated from Shawnee Mission East High School, and in 1988 from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history after transferring from the University of Kansas in his freshman year. Frank received a Master of Arts degree in history in 1990 and a doctorate in history in 1994 from the University of Chicago. His doctoral thesis on advertising in the 1960s, &quot;The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism&quot;, was later published by the University of Chicago Press.

==Politics==
Frank was a College Republican, attending campus meetings at the University of Kansas, but became highly critical of conservatism. He summarized the thesis of his 2008 book &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; as &quot;[b]ad government is the natural product of rule by those who believe government is bad.&quot;

Frank&#x27;s other writings include essays for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, &quot;Bookforum&quot;, and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. His book &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Kansas?&quot; (2004) earned him nationwide and international recognition. In October 2005, Frank received the Eugene Debs Award for his work in the field of social justice.

From December 2010 to February 2014, Frank wrote the monthly &quot;Easy Chair&quot; column for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

Frank identifies as a left-wing populist and supported Bernie Sanders&#x27;s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.

In &quot;Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?&quot; (2016), Frank was one of the few analysts who foresaw that Donald Trump could win the 2016 United States presidential election. In 2018, he called Trump &quot;the worst politician ever&quot;, but maintained that Trump could be reelected in the 2020 presidential election. Frank further observes that &quot;quasi-fascist movements&quot; are springing up around the world.

Frank&#x27;s research into U.S. populism was published as the book &quot;The People, No: A Brief History of Anti-Populism&quot; (2020). In it, he examines the origin of the term in the United States and discusses historical examples of populism and its adherents and detractors.

==Personal life==
Frank lives in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife, Wendy Edelberg, and their children.

<doc id="1119867" wikidata="Q2744146" url="?curid=1119867" title="Fall Out Fall In">
<text>Fall Out Fall In is a Walt Disney cartoon starring Donald Duck. It was released on April 23, 1943, by RKO Radio Pictures. The film&#x27;s title incorporates two military commands: &quot;fall in&quot;, meaning to create an organized formation of soldiers, and &quot;fall out&quot;, to dissolve that formation.

==Plot==
Donald, an Army private, is on an all-day march with his unit. He keeps up his enthusiasm for the first few miles and starts to mark them off on the pack of the soldier in front of him, but fatigue and unforgiving weather conditions - first rain, then snow, then heat - soon take their toll on him. By the time the unit commander calls a halt for the day, the tally marks cover not only the soldier&#x27;s pack, but the backs of his arms, legs, and helmet as well. An exhausted and famished Donald quickly dumps out a mountain of gear from his pack, but he is not allowed to eat until he has set up his tent. It takes him only seconds to do this, but the tent soon collapses and he ends up struggling long into the night to set it up again. He dumps a bucket of water over the sagging canvas, causing it to shrink and rip in half.

As Donald tries to get some sleep, the peculiar snoring patterns of his fellow soldiers - bugler, drummer, machine gunner, mortar artilleryman - keep waking him up. The moment he passes out from exhaustion, the bugler plays reveille to wake everyone up for the new day. He hurriedly crams all his gear into his pack, now comically bulging out in all directions, but inadvertently lashes it to a pine tree as he is tying down the cover. When the unit moves out, he stumbles after the other soldiers, uprooting the pine tree and dragging it along with his pack.

==Home media==
The short was released on May 18, 2004, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Walt Disney on the Front Lines&quot; and on December 6, 2005, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: The Chronological Donald, Volume Two: 1942-1946&quot;.

<doc id="1119869" wikidata="Q2067217" url="?curid=1119869" title="Democrat Party (Turkey, current)">
<text>The Democrat Party (), abbreviated to DP, is a liberal conservative Turkish political party, established by in 1983 as the True Path Party ( or DYP). It succeeded the historical Democrat Party and the Justice Party, two parties with similar ideologies. Their sister party is the Good Party.

The DYP is seen as a centre-right party. DYP&#x27;s history spans back to the historical conservative Democrat Party, established in 1946 with the introduction of a multi-party system in Turkish politics. There have been four DYP governments since its foundation; one led by Süleyman Demirel, the other three by Turkey&#x27;s first and only female Prime Minister, Tansu Çiller. The party now has two seats in the Grand National Assembly, elected in the lists of the Good Party during the 2018 general election.

On 5 May 2007, it was announced that DYP and the Motherland Party (ANAP) would merge to form the Democrat Party (&quot;Demokrat Parti&quot;). For that occasion, DYP renamed itself (based on the historical Democrat Party), and it was planned that ANAP would join the newly founded DP. Shortly before the election, however, the merging attempt failed. However, ANAP stated it would not contest the upcoming elections. After the DP only got about 6% of the votes in the 2007 general election, Ağar resigned as party leader. DYP and the Motherland Party eventually merged in November 2009.

The modern DP&#x27;s logo, a horse upon a red background, derives from the popular mispronunciation of its name, &quot;Demokrat Parti&quot;. The word &quot;Demokrat&quot; did not readily roll off the tongue of rural voters, who found it easier to say &quot;Demir Kırat&quot; (&quot;iron white horse&quot;). After the renaming in mid-2007, the logo became a white horse on a red map of Turkey in order to evoke this mondegreen.

==History==

===Background===
The DYP&#x27;s predecessor was the Democrat Party (, DP), which was a conservative party responsible for relaxing Turkey&#x27;s strict secularism laws. The party was suppressed in the 1960 military coup d&#x27;état and later reestablished as the Justice Party (Adalet Partisi, AP), which was disbanded in the coup of 1980.

Both parties staunchly rivaled the social democratic Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP). The military overthrew their governments on several occasions: In 1960, the Adnan Menderes government was deposed and Menderes himself was executed; on March 26, 1971, the government of party veteran Demirel was threatened with military intervention and forced to resign; and on September 12, 1980, the military carried out a full-scale coup, suppressing all political parties, including Demirel&#x27;s AP.

===Early history (1983–1991)===
In 1983, Demirel created the True Path Party (, DYP), the successor of the AP – still conservative, but now with a secular-leaning policy instead of a religious-leaning one. Even so, the military and conservative governments banned the new party, and the DYP was declared illegal and its members were persecuted. Finally, in 1987, the party was legalized, and entered Turkish politics for the first time. It was hugely successful.

===DYP in government (1991–1997)===
In the 1991 general elections, the DYP defeated the Motherland Party (, ANAP) and the Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), forming a coalition government with the SHP. Süleyman Demirel became Prime Minister once again. After Demirel was elected Turkey&#x27;s 9th President, following the death of Turgut Özal, the party leadership was taken over by Tansu Çiller, who became the country&#x27;s first woman Prime Minister.

In 1995, the coalition with the SHP, now merged with the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP), collapsed. After the December 1995 elections, the weakened DYP formed first a coalition with ANAP, led by Mesut Yılmaz. Then, in June 1996, the DYP switched allegiances to form Turkey&#x27;s first Islamist government with the Welfare Party&#x27;s leader Necmettin Erbakan.

===DYP in opposition (1999–2007)===
In 1997, with the so-called &quot;post-modern coup&quot;, the military effected the RP-DYP government&#x27;s resignation. In the meantime, the DYP had been weakened by the effects of the Susurluk scandal. DYP and others expected to form a government under Çiller, but President Süleyman Demirel asked ANAP leader Mesut Yılmaz to form the new government instead, and the DYP was not included.

In 1998, the DYP took a turn for the worse. The DYP then had heavy recruitment among police intelligence.

The DYP secured 9.55% of the vote in the November 2002 general election, slightly under the 10% election threshold to enter parliament. However, a number of independents later joined the party, and, in November 2004, they had 4 seats in Turkey&#x27;s 549-seat parliament. The figure hardly made the DYP a driving force in Turkish politics, but it remained Turkey&#x27;s third largest party and particularly influential in rural areas.

Tansu Çiller resigned as party leader following the 2002 election defeat; she was eventually replaced by Mehmet Ağar.

===Democrat Party (2007–present)===
On 5 May 2007, it was announced that DYP and the Motherland Party (ANAP) would merge to form the Democrat Party (). For that occasion, DYP renamed itself (based on the previous party of the same name), and it was planned that ANAP would join the newly founded DP. Shortly before the election, however, the merging attempt failed. However, ANAP stated it would not contest the upcoming elections.

After the DP only got about 6% of the votes in the 2007 election, Ağar resigned as party leader. At the 10th party congress held on January 15, 2011, in Ankara, Namık Kemal Zeybek was elected as the party leader. After Zeybek&#x27;s resignation, Gültekin Uysal has become the party leader.

In the 2018 elections, the party participated in the Nation Alliance with the Republican People&#x27;s Party, the Good Party, and the Felicity Party.

<text>A goanna is any one of several species of lizard of the genus &quot;Varanus&quot; found in Australia and Southeast Asia.

Around 70 species of &quot;Varanus&quot; are known, 25 of which are found in Australia. This varied group of carnivorous reptiles ranges greatly in size and fills several ecological niches.

The goanna features prominently in Aboriginal mythology and Australian folklore.

Being predatory lizards, goannas are often quite large with sharp teeth and claws. The largest is the perentie (&quot;V. giganteus&quot;), which can grow over in length. Not all goannas are so large; pygmy goannas may be smaller than the arm of an adult human. The smallest of these, the short-tailed monitor (&quot;V. brevicauda&quot;), reaches only in length. They survive on smaller prey, such as insects and mice.

Goannas combine predatory and scavenging behaviours. They prey on any animal they can catch that is small enough to eat whole. They have been blamed by farmers for the death of sheep, though most likely erroneously, as goannas are also eaters of carrion and are attracted to rotting meat.

Most goannas are dark-coloured, with greys, browns, blacks, and greens featuring prominently; however, white is also common. Many desert-dwelling species also feature yellow-red tones. Camouflage ranges from bands and stripes to splotches, speckles, and circles, and can change as the creature matures, with juveniles sometimes being brighter than adults.

Like most lizards, goannas lay eggs. Most lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but some species lay their eggs inside termite mounds. This offers protection and incubation; additionally, the termites may provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Unlike some other species of lizards, goannas do not have the ability to regrow limbs or tails.

==Etymology==
The name goanna derived from iguana, since early European bush settlers in Australia likened goannas to the South American lizards. Over time, the initial vowel sound was dropped. A similar explanation is used to link possums to the American opossum.

The South African term for a monitor lizard is &quot;leguaan&quot; and this word is also from Spanish &#x27;la iguana&#x27;.

==Species==

==Habitats==

Goannas are found throughout most of Australia, except for Tasmania, and manage to persist in a variety of environments. Most species are known to climb trees or outcrops; several primarily arboreal species are known. The lace monitor (&quot;V. varius&quot;) is probably the best-known among these, but is not the most common. The lace monitor is the second-largest of all goannas, reaching lengths up to . Other more common tree goannas, such as the Timor tree monitor (&quot;V. timorensis&quot;) and mournful tree monitor (&quot;V. tristis&quot;,) do not grow to quite such lengths, typically a maximum of 61 cm, nose-to-tail.

Other goannas are adapted to swampy coastal environments, such as the mangrove goanna (&quot;V. semiremex&quot;). Further still, Mertens&#x27; water monitor (water goanna – &quot;V. mertensi&quot;), found in lagoons and rivers across northern Australia, is streamlined for swimming, using its tail as a paddle. Most other goannas are good swimmers, but tend not to voluntarily venture into water.

==Diet==
The diets of goannas vary greatly depending on the species and the habitat. Prey can include all manner of small animals: insects, smaller lizards, snakes, mammals, birds, and eggs.

Meals are often eaten whole, thus the size of their meals may depend on the size of the animals. Many of the small species feed mostly on insects, with some being small lizard experts. Many of the medium to large species feed on whatever prey they can catch. This includes eggs, fish (&quot;V. mertensi&quot;), birds, snails, smaller lizards, snakes, marsupials, and other small mammals, such as rodents. The giant perentie has been observed killing a young kangaroo, and then biting out chunks of flesh like a dog.

All species are carrion eaters, so feed on the carcasses of dead animals, including livestock and other large creatures. The smell of rotting meat also attracts these lizards.

==Goannas and humans==
===Confrontations===
Like most native fauna, goannas are rather wary of human intrusions into their habitat, and most likely run away (into the scrub, up a tree, or into the water, depending on the species). A goanna is a rather swift mover, and when pressed, sprints short distances on its hind legs.

Goannas also rear up when threatened, either chased or cornered, and also inflate flaps of skin around their throats and emit harsh hissing noises.

Some goannas lose their initial fear of humans, especially when food is involved (or has been previously involved). The wildlife authority recommends not feeding animals while in their territory. An attack can cause serious injury in exceptional cases, but most authorities doubt that a goanna will direct an intentional attack at a human unless the human has attempted to attack it (or grasp at it) first. Indigenous Australians who hunt goannas for food consider the perentie to be a high-risk (but tasty) quarry.

Debate is growing as to whether goannas are venomous. The incessant bleeding caused by goanna bites had been thought to be the result of bacterial infection, but a 2005 study suggested monitor lizards (including goannas) are venomous and have oral toxin-producing glands.

The goanna&#x27;s hefty tail can be dangerous when swung, much like a crocodile&#x27;s tail; small children and dogs have been knocked down by such attacks. Often victims in goanna attacks are bystanders, watching the person antagonising the goanna. Alarmed goannas can mistake standing humans for trees and attempt to climb them to safety, which is painful and can be distressing for both human and goanna.

===Conservation status===
Goannas are protected species throughout Australia.

===Culture and folklore===

Goannas have a prominent place in the culture of indigenous Australians. This includes totemic relationships, anthropomorphic representations in dreamtime stories, and as a food source. Representations of goannas are common in indigenous artwork, not just as food, but also as a symbolic spiritual motif. Smaller goannas and the mighty perentie are often considered two different animals when appearing in aboriginal works, as in the story &quot;How the Goanna and Perentie Got Their Colours&quot;.

European settlers perpetuated several old wives&#x27; tales about goanna habits and abilities; some of these have persisted in modern folklore among campers and bushmen. This includes the above-mentioned exaggeration of goannas dragging off sheep from shepherds&#x27; flocks in the night. This might even be exaggerated into child-snatching, rivalling drop bears (attack koalas) as a tourist scarer, but probably more convincing due to the reptiles&#x27; carnivorous nature and fearsome appearance.

A common tale was that the bite of a goanna was infused with a powerful, incurable venom. Every year after the bite (or every seven years), the wound would flare up again. For many years, herpetologists generally believed goannas were nonvenomous, and lingering illness from their bites was due solely to infection and septicaemia as a result of their saliva being rife with bacteria from carrion and other food sources. However, in 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne announced that oral venom glands had been found in both goannas and iguanas.

Because the goanna regularly eats snakes (which may involve a fierce struggle), including venomous species, they are often said to be immune to snake venom. However, no evidence found suggests an actual venom immunity. Other stories say that the lizard eats a legendary plant, or drinks from a healing spring, which neutralises the venom. (This idea is immortalised in Banjo Paterson&#x27;s humorous poem &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Antidote&quot;.)

Goanna fat or oil has been anecdotally imbued with mystical healing properties (possibly in connection with their supposed venom immunity). Aboriginal people traditionally used goanna oil as an important bush medicine, and it also became a common medicine among Caucasians shortly after British settlement in Australia. Said to be a cure-all, and possessing amazing powers of penetration (passing through metal as if it were not there), it was sold among early settlers like snake oil in the Old West of North America.

A goanna features as the heroic figure Mr Lizard in the Australian author May Gibbs’ children&#x27;s books &quot;Snugglepot and Cuddlepie&quot;. A bronze statue of the goanna Mr Lizard has been placed outside the State Library of Victoria.

The villain in the Disney film &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;, Percival C. McLeach, has a pet goanna named Joanna.

<text>Self Control is the third studio album by American singer Laura Branigan, released on April 1, 1984, by Atlantic Records. The album peaked at number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Internationally, it charted within the top five in several continental European countries.

Four singles were released from the album, including Branigan&#x27;s cover version of Raf&#x27;s &quot;Self Control&quot;, which was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topping the charts in Canada and several European countries. Additionally, &quot;The Lucky One&quot; peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while her cover of Umberto Tozzi&#x27;s &quot;Ti amo&quot; reached number two in Australia and number five in Canada.

A remastered and expanded edition of &quot;Self Control&quot; was released on April 25, 2013, by Gold Legion, including remixes of &quot;The Lucky One&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, as well as the extended version of &quot;Self Control&quot;.

==Reception==

In their review of the album, &quot;Billboard&quot; commended the album as &quot;a superbly balanced set of powerful rhythm pieces and big, torchy ballads. The stand-out in the latter category is a heartfelt version of the Carole King classic &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow.&quot; Several of the songs were translated from French into English, and have the continental flair that characterized Branigan&#x27;s top 10 hits &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Solitaire.&quot; 

&quot;Cashbox&quot; called it a &quot;marvelously textured album&quot; noting that &quot;with the imminent success of the slow-grooving title track single, the album is sure to take hold of the public’s heart...this disc provides the powerful voiced songstress the variety of melody needed to show off her superior interpretive voice.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; noted that &quot;Laura Branigan&#x27;s third album capitalized on the Euro-dance-pop and affecting ballads that made her an international star while allowing her to grow as a vocalist. Her collections, always uneven in terms of material, benefit mostly from her stellar voice, and this is no exception.&quot;The Lucky One&quot; and &quot;Heart&quot; start slow and build to a crescendo, perfectly showcasing her range without being obvious. The title track, about finding sex in the seamy side of town, sparked a bit of a controversy, but ended up being her second biggest hit. The song itself works, but Branigan was never a sex bomb, so the fact that she pulls it off is indicative of her power as a performer. &quot;Ti Amo&quot; is the album&#x27;s theatrical ballad, which works well with breathy, dramatic vocals. She even pulls off a graceful cover of &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&quot; that is clear and simple&quot;

<doc id="1119879" wikidata="Q475607" url="?curid=1119879" title="Skam Records">
<text>Skam Records is an independent electronic music record label based in Manchester, England, founded by Andy Maddocks around 1990. Skam also runs a smaller sub-label called 33.

==History==
Skam&#x27;s first 12-inch single was a self-titled debut from Lego Feet (Sean Booth and Rob Brown, later known as Autechre). The label followed with two 12&quot; records from Gescom, a project whose members vary between each release.

Other early Skam releases came from Freeform (Simon Pyke), Bola, Jega, Team Doyobi, E.Stonji (Jens Döring), and Boards of Canada. Boards of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Hi Scores&quot; EP, and Gescom&#x27;s &quot;Keynell&quot; and &quot;Lego Feet&quot; have been re-pressed or reissued.

Skam entered the full-length market in 1998 with the releases of &quot;Soup&quot; by Bola and &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot; by Boards of Canada, the latter being jointly released with Warp Records.

A recurring feature on the packaging of Skam releases is the title of the album printed in braille.

===Series releases===
Skam makes multiple series of record releases within the label, all of which are an anagram of &quot;SKAM&quot;. The first three records were produced in conjunction with German duo Musik Aus Strom, and the latter two by Skam alone.

Up until the 2004 release of Mr 76ix&#x27;s &quot;Hits of 76ix,&quot; the label has produced a 7&quot; single along with each full-length album; the 7&quot; catalogue numbers begin with the letters &quot;KMAS&quot;. Skam has since stated on its website that future KMAS releases will feature purely exclusive tracks to complement full-length recordings of the same number.

In 2001, Skam began the &quot;SMAK&quot; series. Each SMAK 12&quot; showcased two artists, one per record side. Some SMAK artists, like Quinoline Yellow, have gone on to become full Skam musicians. NMB Allstars (&quot;North Manchester Bedroom Allstars&quot;) went on to become part of the sublabel 33, which Skam has referred to as &quot;a part of the family.&quot; Others, like Ola Bergman and Posthuman went on to set up their own record labels: New Speak and Seed Records, respectively. Made, are known for their live acts. In October 2004, Skam began the &quot;AMKS&quot; series with &quot;Supermechamaximegamegablast&quot; by Mortal and Chemist, which is, as the catalogue number may suggest, a mix.

==Reception==
Tim Haslett wrote of Skam in the October 1997 issue of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly:&quot; &quot;It looked for a while as though the minimalist electronic movement had simply disappeared into the valley of the self-indulgent and repetitive. The monotonous sound of a 909 kick drum and high-hat was really beginning to wear on the nerves of even the most committed techheads. Enter the Manchester-based Skam label, which has single-handedly invigorated a minimal techno sound that&#x27;s not indebted to breakbeats or drum-and-bass. Having released early tracks by cult favorites Gescom and the Boards Of Canada, the Skam imprint has continued to thrive at the periphery of the crepuscular world of underground techno.&quot;

In the same magazine in March 1999, Haslett wrote that Skam:&quot;is notorious for its elusiveness, its tendency to make available only tiny quantities of each release. This might seem an elitist marketing move, an attempt to restrict the audience, but the Skam folks spend so much attention to detail in artwork and sound quality that it&#x27;s easy to forgive them.&quot;

<doc id="1119882" wikidata="Q1259197" url="?curid=1119882" title="Wood engraving">
<text>Wood engraving is a printmaking technique, in which an artist works an image into a block of wood. Functionally a variety of woodcut, it uses relief printing, where the artist applies ink to the face of the block and prints using relatively low pressure. By contrast, ordinary engraving, like etching, uses a metal plate for the matrix, and is printed by the intaglio method, where the ink fills the &quot;valleys&quot;, the removed areas. As a result, the blocks for wood engravings deteriorate less quickly than the copper plates of engravings, and have a distinctive white-on-black character.

Thomas Bewick developed the wood engraving technique in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century. His work differed from earlier woodcuts in two key ways. First, rather than using woodcarving tools such as knives, Bewick used an engraver&#x27;s burin (graver). With this, he could create thin delicate lines, often creating large dark areas in the composition. Second, wood engraving traditionally uses the wood&#x27;s end grain—while the older technique used the softer side grain. The resulting increased hardness and durability facilitated more detailed images.

Wood-engraved blocks could be used on conventional printing presses, which were going through rapid mechanical improvements during the first quarter of the 19th century. The blocks were made the same height as, and composited alongside, movable type in page layouts—so printers could produce thousands of copies of illustrated pages with almost no deterioration. The combination of this new wood engraving method and mechanized printing drove a rapid expansion of illustrations in the 19th century. Further, advances in stereotype let wood-engravings be reproduced onto metal, where they could be mass-produced for sale to printers.

By the mid-19th century, many wood engravings rivaled copperplate engravings. Wood engraving was used to great effect by 19th-century artists such as Edward Calvert, and its heyday lasted until the early and mid-20th century when remarkable achievements were made by Eric Gill, Eric Ravilious, Tirzah Garwood and others. Though less used now, the technique is still prized in the early 21st century as a high-quality specialist technique of book illustration, and is promoted, for example, by the Society of Wood Engravers, who hold an annual exhibition in London and other British venues.

==Development of the term==
The terms &quot;woodcut&quot; and &quot;wood engraving&quot; were used interchangeably in the early and middle part of the 19th century, until the modern distinction emerged towards the end of the century, with confusion often extending into the 20th century among non-specialists. At the start of the 19th, both &quot;wood engraving&quot; and &quot;woodcut&quot; were often used for both types, so that the title page of &quot;A History of British Fishes&quot; (1835), by William Yarrell boasts &quot;illustrated by nearly 400 woodcuts&quot;, which in fact are all wood-engravings, from one of the classic works using the technique.

On the other hand, &quot;A Treatise on Wood Engraving, Historical and Practical&quot; (1839), by William Andrew Chatto, is almost all about woodcut and its much longer history, with Thomas Bewick only appearing from page 558. Chatto is ready to call individual woodcuts &quot;cuts&quot;, but seems never to use &quot;woodcut&quot;. Most of his illustrations are in fact wood engravings, by John Jackson, mostly reproducing woodcuts. &quot;Wood-engraving: A Manual of Instruction&quot; by William James Linton in 1884 and &quot;A History of Wood-engraving&quot; by George Edward Woodberry in 1883 are the same in their use of terms.

By the end of the century the modern distinction between the two terms for the two techniques was clear among specialists, with authoritative works like Campbell Dodgson&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Early German and Flemish Woodcuts&quot; (in the British Museum, London, 1903) and eventually Arthur Mayger Hind&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to the History of Woodcut&quot; (1935). Both authors served as Keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum.

==History==

In 15th- and 16th-century Europe, woodcuts were a common technique in printmaking and printing, yet their use as an artistic medium began to decline in the 17th century. They were still made for basic printing press work such as newspapers or almanacs. These required simple blocks that printed in relief with the text—rather than the elaborate intaglio forms in book illustrations and artistic printmaking at the time, in which type and illustrations were printed with separate plates and techniques.

The beginnings of modern wood engraving techniques developed in the late 17th century, by which time publishers of quality books only used the relief printing of wood blocks for small images in the text such as initials, taking advantage of relief printing blocks to be fitted into the same forme or set-up page as the letterpress type of the text. The Oxford University Press used boxwood engraved on the end-grain for these by this time.

At the end of the 18th century, the English artist and author Thomas Bewick is &quot;usually considered the founder of wood-engraving&quot; as &quot;the first to realize its full potentialities&quot; for larger illustrations. Bewick generally engraved harder woods, such as, rather than the woods used in woodcuts, and he engraved the ends of blocks instead of the side. Finding a woodcutting knife not suitable for working against the grain in harder woods, Bewick used a burin (or graver), an engraving tool with a V-shaped cutting tip. As Thomas Balston explains, Bewick abandoned the attempts of previous wood-engravers &#x27;to imitate the black lines of copper engravings. Though not, as frequently asserted, the inventor of wood-engraving, he was the first to recognise that, as the incisions made by the graver on the wood block printed white, the right use of the medium was to base his designs as much as possible on white lines and areas, and so he became the first to use his graver as a drawing instrument and to employ the medium as an original art. From the beginning of the nineteenth century Bewick&#x27;s techniques gradually came into wider use, especially in Britain and the United States.

Bewick&#x27;s innovations also relied on the improved smoother papers developed in the 18th century. Without these the detail of his images would not have appeared reliably.

Alexander Anderson introduced the technique to the United States. Bewick&#x27;s work impressed him, so he reverse engineered and imitated Bewick&#x27;s technique—using metal until he learned that Bewick used wood. There it was further expanded upon by his students, Joseph Alexander Adams.

===Photographs into woodcuts===

Before the advent of photolithography, newspapers used wood engravings to make photographic reproductions. An artist &quot;meticulously traced the photograph upon the surface of a block of boxwood or other suitable tree, then used a sharp tool to cut out the troughs (the white part of the photo) from the wood. The remaining lines for the black ink stayed &#x27;type high.&#x27; A workman rolled or daubed a layer of ink over the incised surface, laid a sheet of paper on it, pressed it down with a roller, pulled the paper away from the sticky substance,&quot; and the result was a printed image.

===Growth of illustrated publications===
Besides interpreting details of light and shade, from the 1820s onwards, engravers used the method to reproduce freehand line drawings. This was, in many ways an unnatural application, since engravers had to cut away almost all the surface of the block to produce the printable lines of the artist&#x27;s drawing. Nonetheless, it became the most common use of wood engraving.

Examples include the cartoons of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, the pictures in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; and Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s works, the latter engraved by the firm of Dalziel Brothers. In the United States, wood-engraved publications also began to take hold, such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

Frank Leslie, a British-born engraver who had headed the engraving department of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, immigrated to the United States in 1848, where he developed a means to divide the labour for making wood engravings. A single design was divided into a grid, and each engraver worked on a square. The blocks were then assembled into a single image. This process formed the basis for his &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot;, which competed with &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; in illustrating scenes from the American Civil War.

===New techniques and technologies===

By the mid-19th century, electrotyping was developed, which could reproduce a wood engraving on metal. By this method, a single wood-engraving could be mass-produced for sale to printshops, and the original retained without wear.Until 1860, artists working for engraving had to paint or draw directly on the surface of the woodblock and the original artwork was actually destroyed by the engraver. In 1860, however, the engraver Thomas Bolton invented a process for transferring a photograph onto the block.

At about the same time, French engravers developed a modified technique (partly a return to that of Bewick) in which cross-hatching (one set of parallel lines crossing another at an angle) was almost eliminated. Instead, all tonal gradations were rendered by white lines of varying thickness and closeness, sometimes broken into dots for the darkest areas. This technique appears in wood-engravings after Gustave Doré.

Towards the end of the 19th century, a combination of Bolton&#x27;s &#x27;photo on wood&#x27; process and the increased technical virtuosity initiated by the French school gave wood engraving a new application as a means of reproducing drawings in water-colour wash (as opposed to line drawings) and actual photographs. This is exemplified in illustrations in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; during the 1890s. With the new century, improvements in the half-tone process rendered this kind of reproductive engraving obsolete. In a less sophisticated form, it survived in advertisements and trade catalogues until about 1930. With this change, wood engraving was left free to develop as a creative form in its own right, a movement prefigured in the late 1800s by such artists as Joseph Crawhall II and the Beggarstaff Brothers.

Timothy Cole was a traditional wood engraver, executing copies from museum paintings on commission from magazines such as &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;.

==Technique==

Wood engraving blocks are typically made of boxwood or other hardwoods such as lemonwood or cherry. They are expensive to purchase because end-grain wood must be a section through the trunk or large bough of a tree. Some modern wood engravers use substitutes made of PVC or resin, mounted on MDF, which produce similarly detailed results of a slightly different character.

The block is manipulated on a &quot;sandbag&quot; (a sand-filled circular leather cushion). This helps the engraver produce curved or undulating lines with minimal manipulation of the cutting tool.

Wood engravers use a range of specialized tools. The &quot;lozenge graver&quot; is similar to the burin used by copper engravers of Bewick&#x27;s day, and comes in different sizes. Various sizes of &quot;V-shaped graver&quot; are used for hatching. Other, more flexible, tools include the &quot;spitsticker&quot;, for fine undulating lines; the &quot;round scorper&quot; for curved textures; and the &quot;flat scorper&quot; for clearing larger areas.

Wood engraving is generally a black-and-white technique. However, a handful of wood engravers also work in colour, using three or four blocks of primary colours—in a way parallel to the &quot;four-colour process&quot; in modern printing. To do this, the printmaker must &quot;register&quot; the blocks (make sure they print in exactly the same place on the page). Recently, engravers have begun to use lasers to engrave wood.

<doc id="1119888" wikidata="Q447962" url="?curid=1119888" title="Swing revival">
<text>The swing revival, also called retro swing and neo-swing, was a renewed interest in swing music and Lindy Hop dance, beginning around 1989 and reaching a peak in the 1990s. The music was generally rooted in the big bands of the swing era of the 1930s and 1940s, but it was also greatly influenced by rockabilly, boogie-woogie, the jump blues of artists such as Louis Prima and Louis Jordan, and the theatrics of Cab Calloway. Many neo-swing bands practiced contemporary fusions of swing, jazz, and jump blues with rock, punk rock, ska, and ska punk music or had roots in punk, ska, ska punk, and alternative rock music.

==History==
The roots of the swing revival are generally traced back to 1989, which saw the formation of several of the scene&#x27;s most prominent figures: Los Angeles&#x27; Royal Crown Revue and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, who often stuck close to playing traditionally-styled jump blues and rockabilly; San Francisco&#x27;s swing scene included Lee Presson and the Nails who started performing at local clubs in 1994 and Lavay Smith &amp; Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers, who showcased vocal jazz and blues influences, emerging in 1996; and Eugene, Oregon&#x27;s Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, who incorporated elements of punk rock and ska into swing and jazz music.

California soon emerged as the center of the burgeoning neo-swing movement, with such clubs as Los Angeles&#x27; The Derby and San Francisco&#x27;s Club DeLuxe regularly hosting swing and jazz bands as well as offering free swing dancing lessons. By the early 1990s, swing music had started appearing in popular culture, serving as the focal point of the 1993 drama &quot;Swing Kids&quot; while featuring heavily in the 1994 comedy &quot;The Mask&quot;, in which Royal Crown Revue made an on-screen cameo. By this time, retro swing had started expanding outside of its West Coast roots, leading to the formation of swing bands in such places as Texas (8½ Souvenirs, The Lucky Strikes), Michigan (The Atomic Fireballs, The Deluxtone Rockets), North Carolina (Squirrel Nut Zippers) and Canada (Big Rude Jake, Johnny Favourite Swing Orchestra).

In 1996, the American comedy &quot;Swingers&quot;, which featured scenes filmed at The Derby and a musical performance by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, became a critical and commercial success and is frequently credited with bringing the swing revival further into the cultural mainstream.

In April 1997, the Squirrel Nut Zippers&#x27; 1996 single &quot;Hell&quot; appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, effectively becoming the first hit song of the swing revival; their album &quot;Hot&quot; would achieve platinum sales of one million units by the RIAA by December 1997. In March 1997, the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies released their swing compilation &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, attaining platinum status in August 1998 and double-platinum status in January 2000 while its titular single peaked at #41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Brian Setzer Orchestra, which was founded by former Stray Cats frontman Brian Setzer in 1992, also achieved double-platinum sales with their 1998 album &quot;The Dirty Boogie&quot;, whose cover of Louis Prima&#x27;s 1956 song &quot;Jump, Jive an&#x27; Wail&quot; became the highest-charting single of swing revival, peaking at #23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. At the same time in 1998, The Gap used Prima&#x27;s version of &quot;Jump, Jive an&#x27; Wail&quot; in a &quot;Khakis Swing&quot; commercial; according to Stereogum, Gap&#x27;s commercialization of the revival in particular was considered as signifying the end of the 90s swing revival or movement, though examples of neo-swing in general continue to be produced beyond the 90s.

<text>Reginald James Watson (27 August 1926 – 8 October 2019) was an Australian television producer and screenwriter and executive.

Watson was executive producer on the British soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot; and created Australian media exports serials such as &quot;Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;.

==Career==
Watson was born on 27 August 1926, and grew up on a sugar farm in Queensland. He began his career as an actor at the age of sixteen on Australian radio firstly as an actor and then as an announcer, before moving to the UK in 1955.

He was soon hired by ATV and in 1956, joined Ned Sherrin and Noele Gordon in Birmingham to establish the base of ATV Midlands where his job was as head of Light Entertainment.

In this role, he created many programmes for the station with his first big hit being the live daily chat show, &quot;Lunchbox&quot;. It ran from 1956 to 1964 to over 3,000 editions with its presenter, Noele Gordon, becoming a regional celebrity. In 1958, Watson submitted a proposal to ATV for a new Midlands based soap opera; however, it was not until 1964 that Lew Grade, head of the company, granted approval for a series. Initially called &quot;The Midland Road&quot;, the project was renamed &quot;Crossroads&quot; by Watson just before its run began. Created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling, it achieved audiences of 18 million.

After ten years producing &quot;Crossroads&quot; and eighteen years at ATV, he decided to return to Australia in 1973. Upon his return home, he took up the post of head of drama at Reg Grundy Productions. Thanks to his popular British soap, he was able to create many more series in Australia including &quot;Until Tomorrow&quot; (1975), &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; (1976), &quot;The Restless Years&quot; (1977), &quot;Prisoner&quot; (1979), &quot;Taurus Rising&quot; (1982), &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; (1982), &quot;Waterloo Station&quot; (1983), &quot;Starting Out&quot; (1983), &quot;Possession&quot; (1985), and &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; (1988). &quot;Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Richmond Hill&quot;, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; later aired in the UK, with the first show known in Britain as &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot; in order to avoid confusion with Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s surreal 1960s TV series.

The prominence he gained from &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; helped his idea for &quot;Neighbours&quot; to be picked up by the Seven Network in 1985. After being cancelled by Seven that year due to low ratings, it switched to the Ten Network at the start of 1986 and slowly its ratings climbed. The show ended in July 2022 after 37 years but, four months later, it was announced that &quot;Neighbours&quot; was to return on FreeVee and the first episode of the new series aired in September 2023. It is the longest-running drama series in Australian television history. At the 47th Annual TV Week Logie Awards held on 1 May 2005, &quot;Neighbours&quot; became the 22nd inductee into the &quot;TV Week&quot; Hall of Fame.

Watson also dabbled in television in the US, producing &quot;Dangerous Women&quot;, a short-lived soap opera based on the Australian &quot;Prisoner&quot; series.

==Personal life==
Watson was a private man and rarely gave interviews. He retired in 1992 and did not produce any new television drama from then onwards.

On 26 January 2010, Watson was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for services to the media as a pioneer in the creation and production of serial television drama.

On 8 October 2019, Watson died aged 93, after a short illness. &quot;Neighbours&quot; announced his death on their official Twitter account. The show&#x27;s executive producer, Jason Herbison described Watson as a &quot;pioneer of drama&quot;, while writer Bevan Lee called him &quot;a trailblazer in Australian commercial television drama&quot;. Both Lee and television historian Andrew Mercado believed Watson should be inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.

<text>Branigan 2 is the second studio album by American singer Laura Branigan, released in March 1983 by Atlantic Records. The album reached number 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on September 18, 1985, denoting shipments in excess of 500,000 copies in the United States.

Three singles were released from the album. The lead single, &quot;Solitaire&quot;, is a cover version of a 1981 French-language song of the same name by French singer Martine Clémenceau, with English lyrics written by Diane Warren. The single was a commercial success, peaking at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The second single, &quot;How Am I Supposed to Live Without You&quot;, was co-written by Michael Bolton. It reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks.

&quot;Branigan 2&quot; also includes a cover of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; (1975), as well as &quot;Deep in the Dark&quot;, a newly written song to the music of Falco&#x27;s &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; (1981). &quot;Deep in the Dark&quot; was released in the United Kingdom as the album&#x27;s third and final single.

The song &quot;Find Me&quot; was used as the love theme of the 1983 Robert Hays film &quot;Touched&quot;.

==Reception==

In their review of the album, &quot;Billboard&quot; commended the album, stating that &quot;Branigan follows the top 40 album &quot;Branigan&quot; with this set of riveting, pulsating rhythm ballads
in the vein of her smash hit &quot;Gloria.&quot; The most intriguing cuts on the album is a remake of, of all things, the Who&#x27;s 1975 hit &quot;Squeeze Box.&quot; Branigan shows her vocal power on the new hit &quot;Solitaire,&quot; and on two other songs that were first hits in Europe and later translated into English: &quot;Deep In The Dark&quot; (where Branigan mixes talking and singing) and &quot;Mama.&quot; The album&#x27;s title may be disengenious, but the music reflects continued growth by a promising new star.&quot;

&quot;Cashbox&quot; noted that &quot;1982 saw newcomer Laura Branigan capture the #1 spot on the Cash Box Pop Singles chart with a neo-disco tune called “Gloria,” and this year she’s back with another LP boasting a hot single, “Solitaire”. The sultry chanteuse also scores points here with an insightful version of The Who’s “Squeeze Box” and still another In the “Der Kommissar” series of covers, as Branigan takes Falco’s original hit and
spices it up with sexy, paranoid lyrics about things moving “Deep In The Dark.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; praised the album, noting that &quot;Laura Branigan&#x27;s full, expressive voice shows serious growth on this, her second album. A much more cohesive collection than her first disc, the material on &quot;Branigan 2&quot; utilizes her vocals to their fullest extent; and while there were many filler songs on her debut, this album doesn&#x27;t waste a single track...though this album isn&#x27;t the most mature album of its time, it shows she&#x27;s more comfortable with herself and her voice and shows enormous promise of what she&#x27;s really capable.&quot;

== History ==

Situated in the valley of the Rio Doce, Baixo Guandu occupies a prominent place in the political and socio-economical development of Espírito Santo.

The county was created on April 10, 1935, it was initially colonized by migrants from Cantagalo Rio de Janeiro and European immigrants, especially from Italy and Germany.

The history of Baixo Guandu is directly linked to the pioneering spirit that marked the beginning of the 20th century in the valley of Rio Doce. The rails of the first train arrived in 1907 and the economic activities were intensified. The abundant wood was removed and taken by train to the capital.

According to the testimony of bandeirantes and travelers who have visited the lower Rio Doce since the second half of the 20th century by the middle of last century, the Indians Botocudos native sons and daughters were masters of the region between Rio Doce and the River São Mateus.

The first penetration in the territory of the Baixo Guandu, the former jurisdiction of the municipality of Colatina occurred in 1875, when the major José Vieira de Carvalho Milagres, veteran Paraguayan War reaches the confluence of the Rio Doce river Guandu and there down the core leading to the city.

The colonization of the region, initiated by major Milagres, had his base-grounded in the work of European immigrants of various origins, located in the colonial core of Afonso Pena, today Ibituba.

The foreign colonists settled in the valley of the guandu and the other Ribeirão do Lage. On both sides, there are still today the hallmarks of the European heritage in the region.

The Italians came in Baixo Guandu in 1866 by the initiative of Mr. Francisco Vieira de Carvalho Milagres. A Província do Espírito Santo of June 2, 1866, reported that Mr. Milagres written to his friend Guilherme Frederico, announcing the departure of Genoa, with forty contractors. Days later, came, in fact, from Rio de Janeiro, forty Italians, for their lands in the Rio Doce (June 5, 1866).

The farmer and settler Francisco Vieira de Carvalho Milagres returned to Europe in 1894, in order to bring more workers to his land. The immigrants arrived in the Matteo Bruzzo, as the news of the State of the Espírito Santo of December 8 of the same year and, on 10, went to Rio Doce, and from there, took their destination, where even today, there are their descendants.

As if it had been the desire to repair the abolition of the District of Baixo Guandu, President Henrique da Silva Coutinho created the colony of 1905, including this area is not legitimate Baixo Guandu, to the limits with the municipality of Afonso Cláudio and Minas Gerais. Divided and donated a portion of the batch, they were sold to Italian, French, German, and Spanish settlers them crowded.

The farmer Francisco da Cunha Ramaldes, born in 1861, son of José da Cunha Ramaldes and Balbina Maria de Jesus, from Lajinha do Chalé, State of Minas Gerais, establishes in 1910 in the mountain region of Alto Mutum Preto where he initiates a very lucrative coffee plantation.

Baixo Guandu was the first Brazilian city to receive water treated with fluoride in 1953 in order to reduce the incidence of caries, especially among children.

In 1974, was inaugurated in the city&#x27;s largest hydroelectric plant in the state, providing power to the Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais. The reservoir, with the use of the waters of the Rio Doce, reaches the volume of 39,500,000 meters cubic. The dam of reinforced concrete measures 45 meters high and 539 meters wide.

<doc id="1119913" wikidata="Q3284273" url="?curid=1119913" title="Branigan (album)">
<text>Branigan is the debut studio album by American singer Laura Branigan, released on March 8, 1982, by Atlantic Records. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;All Night with Me&quot;, reached number 69 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the second single, an English version of Italian singer Umberto Tozzi&#x27;s song &quot;Gloria&quot;, was a commercial success, propelling Branigan to international prominence.

The album was certified Gold in both the United States and Canada. Her Eurodisco version of &quot;Gloria&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female in 1983.

A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on July 7, 2014, by Gold Legion. Included is the 12-inch mix of &quot;Gloria&quot;, extending the song&#x27;s original length from 4:51 to 5:53 with much of this intro disengaged. Several tracks are hard to find from the album sessions, all but one of which were released as singles or B-sides prior to the release of the final album.

==Reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; praised the album, stating &quot;don&#x27;t be taken by Branigan&#x27;s pretty yet dainty image she exudes on the cover art. This lady has a set of chops that she puts to maximum effectiveness on this collection of hot rockers and some mellower fare. Supported by studio hotshots like Steve Lukather, Lee Sklar, Michael Boddicker, Bob Glaub and others, Branigan&#x27;s voice explodes with a fury, making it clear that she&#x27;s in the same league as her competition.&quot;

AllMusic was more mixed in their review, commenting that &quot;this album, despite being worth checking out simply for Branigan&#x27;s powerful voice, is middling at best. Though she finds nuances in lyrics and melodies that are not up to her talent, the production often bogs the album down, especially on the ballads.&quot;

<doc id="1119920" wikidata="Q3488463" url="?curid=1119920" title="The Gamesters of Triskelion">
<text>&quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot; is the sixteenth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Margaret Armen and directed by Gene Nelson, it was first broadcast January 5, 1968.

In the episode, Captain Kirk and his companions are abducted into slavery and trained to fight as gladiators for the gambling entertainment of three disembodied beings.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; inspects an unmanned station at Gamma II. Captain Kirk, Communications Officer Lieutenant Uhura and navigator Ensign Chekov attempt to transport, but disappear before the system activates. Commander Spock orders a search for them and discovers an ion trail.

Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov find themselves in a gladiator arena on a strange planet. They are attacked by four humanoids and subdued. Galt, Master Thrall of Triskelion, informs them that they will be trained in games to entertain his masters, the Providers. Each is fitted with a &quot;collar of obedience&quot; that engages when they disobey Galt&#x27;s orders. Uhura, Chekov, and Kirk are assigned individual &quot;drill thralls&quot;: Lars, Tamoon, and Shahna, respectively. After a period of training, the Providers bid for the new thralls in their currency, &quot;quatloos&quot;.

While running among ancient ruins outside the arena, Kirk tries gaining information about the Providers from Shahna, but her collar is activated when she speaks too freely. Kirk protests that he should have been the one punished, and when they are returned to their cells, Shahna expresses her appreciation for this. When she moves to embrace him, Kirk knocks her unconscious, and uses her key to free himself, Uhura, and Chekov, but they are stopped by Galt.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; follows the ion trail, finding a planet with a humanoid settlement. As Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy prepare to beam down, the voice of Provider One warns them not to transport. Kirk&#x27;s voice is also heard, and he brings them up to date. Kirk challenges the Providers to show themselves and finds himself in an underground chamber; The Providers are three disembodied brains. Kirk offers them a wager: he and his two officers will fight an equal number of thralls. If Kirk and his party win, the Providers will teach the thralls to govern themselves. If they lose, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew will become thralls. Kirk embarrasses them by indicating &quot;How is it that humans can teach primitive cultures, but the providers say they cannot do it&quot;. The Providers agree, stipulating that Kirk must battle three thralls alone.

As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew watches from the ship, Kirk kills two thralls and injures a third. Galt sends in Shahna. Kirk subdues her, and she surrenders. The Providers declare that Kirk has won the wager and unlock the thralls&#x27; collars. Shahna expresses a desire to follow Kirk to the stars, but he answers that she and the other thralls must first learn to live in their newfound freedom.

==Cultural impact==
The duel was parodied in the Simpsons episode &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot;, with onlooking NASA scientists wagering quatloos as Homer Simpson fights Barney Gumble in an arena as the &quot;Trek&quot; battle theme plays.

Kirk&#x27;s speech to Shahna about love was referenced in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Hooked on Monkey Fonics&quot;. The scene in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode is taken from this episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; &quot;complete with similar incidental music&quot;.

The popular &quot;Star Trek&quot; catchphrase &quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot; is a common misquotation, with &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot; stating that the nearest equivalent is the phrase uttered in this episode: &quot;Scotty, beam us up.&quot;

==Television studies==
The episode has been mentioned and discussed in a number of works of television studies. In &quot;Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon&quot; (2013), the episode is compared to the &quot;Green Ice/Deep Freeze&quot; episode pairing in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series. &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot; is also described in &quot;Modern Amazons: Warrior Women on Screen&quot; (2006), with the character Shahna dressed in &quot;traditional Amazonian attire&quot; and the episode being given as an example of female domination. The authors also observe that the episode was one of the minority of &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes in the original series written by a woman (17 of its 79 episodes were written or co-written by women) and that Margaret Armen was a &quot;veteran of warrior women shows like &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;The Big Valley&quot;&quot;, although Armen&#x27;s lone &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; episode dates from several years after &quot;Star Trek&quot; ceased production.

The themes of religion and philosophy in this episode are discussed in Robert Asa&#x27;s detailed critique of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot; Asa notes that god-figures, such as those featured in &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion,&quot; are &quot;consistently disappointing, decadent and/or dangerous&quot; and that specifically the Providers of Triskelion use &quot;humanoids as playthings for personal amusement&quot;. The episode &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot; is cited by American literary and media critic Paul A. Cantor as an example of &quot;the end of history&quot;. In a footnote to his 2001 work, Cantor draws parallels between this episode and Hegelian philosophy, referring to the prediction of Alexandre Kojève regarding gambling and concluding that Kirk dragged the Triskelions &quot;back into history [...] reinaugurating a kind of Hegelian dialectic of masters and slaves&quot;.

==Production details==
It was produced after John Meredyth Lucas had taken over for Gene L. Coon as the program&#x27;s line producer at the latter&#x27;s request. Gerald Perry &quot;Jerry&quot; Finnerman was the director of photography for the installment, and his cinematography protégé, Al Francis, was chief camera operator.

The episode was originally titled &quot;The Gamesters of Pentathlan&quot;. The original script called for Sulu instead of Chekov, but George Takei was away filming &quot;The Green Berets&quot; at the time.

==Reception==
In 2017, Den of Geek ranked this episode as the 12th &quot;best worst&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series, noting its entertainment value.

In 2016, TVline ranked this as having one of the top twenty moments of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, when Kirk not only spares the life of his defeated opponent, but also convinces the alien authority to allow a free society.

<text>USS &quot;Perch&quot; (SS/SSP/ASSP/APSS/LPSS/IXSS-313), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the second submarine of the United States Navy to be named for the perch, a freshwater spiny-finned fish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Perch&quot; was laid down on 5 January 1943 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut; launched on 12 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. David A. Hart; and commissioned on 7 January 1944.

==Operational history==
After shakedown, &quot;Perch&quot; departed 19 February 1944 for Key West, Florida, where she gave services to the Fleet Sound School. She then sailed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving 3 April 1944.

===First and second war patrols, April – August 1944===

On 29 April she departed Pearl Harbor with for Midway where joined them. The South China Sea was the hunting ground for the wolf pack. Early in the morning of 24 May, a medium tanker was contacted and damaged by four torpedo hits. The counterattack by a lone escort prevented further observation of the damage inflicted and knocked out both high pressure air compressors by flooding of the pump room. &quot;Perch&quot; headed for the Marshall Islands, arriving at Majuro on 4 June.

On 27 June &quot;Perch&quot; began her second war patrol, this time off Surigao Strait in the Philippines. She sank a 100-ton Japanese trawler with gunfire before returning to Pearl Harbor 26 August.

===Third and fourth war patrols, September 1944 – February 1945===

&quot;Perch&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on her third war patrol 19 September. At Midway she joined submarines and and the three set out for the confined waters of the East China and Yellow Seas. &quot;Perch&quot; unsuccessfully attacked one heavily escorted transport, and performed lifeguard duty supporting B-29 raids on Honshū. &quot;Perch&quot; then headed for Saipan to refuel en route to Brisbane, Australia, for duty with Submarines, Southwest Pacific Fleet.

The fourth war patrol began 19 December from Brisbane. First &quot;Perch&quot; patrolled off Hainan, China; next off Singapore; and finally in Balabac Straits off Borneo. She sighted no enemy ships, and the patrol ended at Fremantle, Western Australia, 15 February 1945.

===Fifth and sixth war patrols, March – June 1945===

On 12 March &quot;Perch&quot; departed Fremantle carrying with her eleven Australasian specialists trained in commando warfare, under the command of Major Donald Stott. On the first night of the mission, in the Makassar Straits, above Balikpapan, Borneo, she landed four of the party (including Stott) who were to make a reconnaissance of the beach and surrounding territory. Coming in close ashore two nights later to disembark the remainder of the party, &quot;Perch&quot; contacted a 300-ton coastal freighter that threatened to cut off her return to open water. She engaged it with gunfire and the second hit caused the freighter to burst into flames and sink. The first party were never heard from again. It was speculated that the engine which powered the officers kayak was heard. Locals believed they had been captured and executed by the Japanese. The second party rowed ashore, and placed their charges to blow up an oil supply pipeline. They were closely chased by Japanese patrols, but escaped by taking a small boat off the island. They were picked up well out to sea by a Catalina on patrol; only two of the party survived. &quot;Perch&quot; returned to Fremantle, Western Australia, completing her fifth war patrol.

On 15 April &quot;Perch&quot; departed Fremantle on her sixth war patrol and journeyed to the Java Sea to hunt out the enemy. When she contacted a convoy of two ships, an alert Japanese escort discovered &quot;Perch&quot; and subjected her to a severe two-hour depth charging which caused considerable damage throughout the boat. She then sailed to the China coast to patrol off Hainan before returning to Pearl Harbor 5 June.

===Seventh war patrol, July – August 1945===

On 11 July &quot;Perch&quot; departed Pearl Harbor and after fueling at Saipan, proceeded north for duty in the &quot;Lifeguard League&quot; off Japan. On 13 August she rescued a Navy Corsair pilot from the water two miles (3 km) offshore, bombarded fishing vessels and buildings on the beach, and retired to sea. A few hours later the same day, she picked up another pilot from the same fighter squadron five miles (8 km) offshore. Two days later Japan capitulated and &quot;Perch&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 30 August.

===Conversion to transport submarine; Korean War===

&quot;Perch&quot; departed Pearl Harbor and set course for the Golden Gate, arriving Hunter&#x27;s Point 8 September. She decommissioned and was placed in reserve in January 1947. On 19 January 1948 &quot;Perch&quot; was redesignated as a Submarine Transport, SSP–313, and was placed in an active status, attached to the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

&quot;Perch&quot; recommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 20 May 1948. Through 1949, the ship participated in various troop- and cargo-carrying exercises. On 31 January 1950 &quot;Perch&quot; was reclassified a &quot;transport submarine,&quot; ASSP-313. In September 1950 &quot;Perch&quot; transported a force from Britain&#x27;s 41 (Independent) Commando Royal Marines in a raid on the northeast coast of Korea west of Tanchon. The target, a train tunnel on the north-south supply line, was destroyed, with the loss of one man who was buried at sea. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander R. D. Quinn, became the only submarine commanding officer to receive a combat award during the Korean War when he was awarded the Bronze Star for this action.

During this time, the &quot;Perch&quot; was fitted with a large sausage shaped hangar on her aft deck. Operational tests were made with both helicopter and amphibious boats.

===1950s===

From August 1951 to March 1952, &quot;Perch&quot; underwent overhaul at Mare Island. From 1952 to 1954, &quot;Perch&quot; trained, making &quot;reconnaissance-runs&quot; and &quot;raids&quot; on several Alaskan and Hawaiian islands. In January 1955 &quot;Perch&quot; made a cruise to WestPac conducting a &quot;reconnaissance and raid&quot; on Iwo Jima and observed other islands in the Bonin Chain. Periods between Far Eastern cruises, &quot;Perch&quot; performed type training and intertype amphibious exercises in the San Diego area.

&quot;Perch&quot;, again classified as a Submarine Transport, APSS-313, on 24 October 1956, departed San Diego 5 November for a reconnaissance exercise in the Panama Canal Area, returning to San Diego 11 December. In late 1957 she made a reconnaissance voyage from San Diego to Hawaii and Alaska, and spent most of 1958 and 1959 in amphibious training exercises in the San Diego area with marines and Underwater Demolition Teams.

In December 1959 &quot;Perch&quot; departed San Diego, decommissioned on 31 March 1960, and entered the Mare Island Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Vallejo, Calif.

===1960s–1970s===

&quot;Perch&quot; recommissioned 11 November 1961, Lt. Comdr. C.H. Hedgepeth in command, trained on the West Coast and Hawaii through 1962, and arrived at her new homeport, Subic Bay, Philippine Islands in March 1963. Her operations consisted of training the U.S. Marine&#x27;s Amphibious Recon Battalion, Army Special Forces, and Navy UDTs in reconnaissance and also in providing training services to allied countries. In May and June 1964 &quot;Perch&quot; traveled to Mindoro and trained with British commando forces. July and August were spent in Hong Kong, Pohong Bay, Korea (with R.O.K. Special Forces), Yokosuka and Okinawa, Japan.

March and April 1965, saw &quot;Perch&quot; participating in exercise &quot;Jungle Drum III&quot; by landing 75 Marine Corps reconnaissance personnel on the Malay Peninsula from the Gulf of Siam. &quot;Perch&quot; conducted search and rescue operations in the Vietnam combat zone during August and September. She made two amphibious landings on the coast of South Vietnam during November and December as part of Operation Dagger Thrust.

During January 1966 &quot;Perch&quot; landed UDT personnel for beach survey work in South Vietnam as part of Operation Double Eagle. She then provided services at Legaspi, Philippines to train Filipino and American UDT personnel. Between local training operations in the Subic Bay area, Perch worked with Chinese Special Forces at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and with Army Special Forces at Keelung, Taiwan.

In July &quot;Perch&quot; participated in Operation Deckhouse II on the coast of South Vietnam. Again in August, &quot;Perch&quot; conducted several independent beach surveys with UDT personnel along the coast of South Vietnam. For Operation Deckhouse IV in September &quot;Perch&quot; landed UDT personnel on five successive nights for pre-invasion beach reconnaissance. On 7 October 1966, &quot;Perch&quot; headed for Pearl Harbor via Hong Kong, Palau Islands, Guam, and Midway Island. She operated in Hawaiian waters until 1967 when she became Naval Reserve Training submarine at San Diego. On 22 August 1968 &quot;Perchs classification was changed from APSS–313 to Submarine Transport LPSS–313. She was designated an Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarine IXSS-313&quot;&#x27; on 30 June 1971.

<doc id="1119950" wikidata="Q3722328" url="?curid=1119950" title="2004 Botswana general election">
<text>General elections were held in Botswana on 30 October 2004, alongside local elections. The result was a ninth consecutive victory for the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which won 44 of the 57 seats in the National Assembly.

==Background==
The Independent Electoral Commission had a campaign to encourage voter registration, with a target of registering at 500,000 voters. Although it achieved its target, registering around 61% of the estimated 900,000 voting-age population, the opposition Botswana National Front (BNF) accused it of making errors in the registration process.

==Campaign==
For the first time, the election campaign involved parties using billboards. However, the opposition claimed that their media access was restricted, and a study by the Media Institute of Southern Africa showed that the BDP had received over 50% of the election coverage. The BDP campaigned on promises to improve training, expand electricity and water supplies and amend laws that discriminated against women. The campaign of the opposition parties focused on unemployment and poverty. However, although the BNF, Botswana Alliance Movement (BAM) and Botswana People&#x27;s Party (BPP), entered into an electoral pact agreement in 2003, their campaigns were marked by open personal attacks between them and their leaders.

Fifty-six of the 57 constituencies were contested, with Vice President Ian Khama unopposed in the Serowe North constituency.

==Conduct==
For the first time, international monitors were able to observe the elections, with delegations from the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, the Commonwealth and the United Nations in attendance. There were 11,000 personnel from the Independent Electoral Commission involved in running the elections.

<doc id="1119953" wikidata="Q960685" url="?curid=1119953" title="Santiago de Liniers, 1st Count of Buenos Aires">
<text>Santiago Antonio María de Liniers y Bremond, 1st Count of Buenos Aires, KOM, OM (July 25, 1753 – August 26, 1810) was a Spanish military officer and a viceroy of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. Although born Jacques de Liniers in France, he is more widely known by the Spanish form of his name.

He was popularly regarded as the hero of the reconquest of Buenos Aires after the first British invasion of the River Plate. As a result of his success, he was appointed as viceroy, replacing Rafael de Sobremonte. It was unprecedented for a viceroy to be replaced without the King&#x27;s direct intervention. But he was confirmed in office by Charles IV of Spain.

He defended the settlement against a second British invasion and a mutiny that sought to replace him. He was replaced in 1809 by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed as viceroy by the Junta of Seville, and retired from public activity. But when the May Revolution took place, Liniers decided to come out of his retirement and organized a monarchist uprising in Córdoba. Liniers was forced to flee, but was eventually captured and executed without trial.

==Early life==
Santiago de Liniers y Bremond, Chevalier of the Order of Saint John, Caballero of the Order of Montesa, and Captain in the Spanish Royal Navy was born in Niort, Poitou, France, as Jacques, 4th son of Jacques Joseph Louis, comte de Liniers (1723–1785) and Captain in the French Royal Navy, and Henriette Thérèse de Brémond d&#x27;Ars (1725–1770).

The Liniers family had been part of the French nobility since the 11th century. One of their ancestors, Guillaume de Liniers, was killed at the Battle of Poitiers, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Eight other members were professed knights of the Order of Saint John.

In 1765, when Jacques was 12 years old, he entered the military academy of the Order of St. John. (As a younger son who was unlikely to inherit the title or the estates, Liniers was sent to their school in order to train for a military career.) After three years, he graduated with the Cross of Chevalier (1768). He was commissioned as a Sub-Lieutenant of Cavalry in the in the French Royal Army.

==Serving the Spanish Crown==
In 1774 Liniers requested dismissal and re-enlisted as a volunteer in the campaigns against the Moors in Algiers. He benefited from the third Pacte de Famille (1761), which allowed Frenchmen to take part in Spanish military campaigns with equal rights and requirements as the Spaniards. At the campaign&#x27;s conclusion, Liniers took an exam as a Midshipman in Cádiz, to serve as a volunteer for the Spanish Crown. In 1775 he earned the rank of Ensign in the Spanish Navy.

In 1776, under the orders of Pedro de Cevallos, Liniers sailed to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and took part on the occupation of Santa Catarina Island in Portuguese Brazil and the attack on Colonia del Sacramento (modern day Uruguay).

In 1779, Liniers was an officer on the &quot;San Vicente&quot;. Spain joined the Franco-American alliance in the American Revolutionary War as a renewal of the Bourbon Family Compact. The &quot;San Vicente&quot; was part of the Spanish-French naval squadron fighting against the Royal Navy in South America.

Liniers distinguished himself during the American Revolution. In 1780, with a few sloops, he captured a three-masted ship of 24 guns. In 1782, he distinguished himself particularly in the siege of Port Mahon: under fire, he moved to where two British ships had collided, which were laden with arms and ammunition. He captured the ships and conveyed them to the Spanish lines. He was promoted to Frigate Captain.

A few months later Liniers took part in a new expedition, this time against the city of Algiers, in North Africa, which was the main base of the Barbary corsairs, with the aim of forcing them to stop piracy and the Barbary slave trade. As the campaign did not go well for the Spanish navy, Madrid tried to negotiate instead. Liniers was entrusted with this mission. The king of Tripoli was delighted with Liniers, and agreed to free several European prisoners. The Barbary pirates associated with North Africa had long been attacking European shipping in the Mediterranean, and had taken numerous prisoners over the years.

The Spanish court rewarded Liniers for this diplomatic success, promoting him to the rank of captain and entrusting him with the command of the Río de la Plata in 1788 to organize a flotilla of gunships. Liniers took with him his son Luis and his first wife, Juana de Menviel, whom he had married in Málaga. She died two years later in 1790. Liniers married again, this time in Buenos Aires, to María Martina Sarratea, daughter of one of the richest merchants of Buenos Aires.

==First British Invasion==

The Napoleonic Wars expanded to South America. Britain gained naval supremacy over France with its victory at the battle of Trafalgar. France attacked Britain economically by imposing the Continental System, locking the continent to British trade. Needing new markets, Britain invaded Buenos Aires and Montevideo, two Spanish colonies in South America (Spain was allied to France in the war). Home Riggs Popham attempted to invade Buenos Aires, without official orders.

June 23, 1806, a British expeditionary force of 1,700 men landed on the left bank of the Río de la Plata and invaded Buenos Aires, which had been abandoned by the Viceroy. Liniers remained in the city in disguise, staying in the Dominican convent. At the altar of the Virgin, he vowed to return with the colours (flags) of the British. He escaped to Montevideo and, with the help of its governor Pascual Ruiz Huidobro, galvanized the people, raising a force of 1,200 volunteers.

He embarked with this liberation army on a few schooners, which joined a French privateer corvette. Landing on August 4, Liniers and his men rushed across the marshes to Buenos Aires. The city was recovered after fierce street fighting that ended with the storming of the cathedral, which had been fortified by the British. British General William Carr Beresford capitulated and offered his sword; true to Liniers&#x27;s vow, British colours (those of the Highlanders regiment and Green St. Helena) were transferred to the church of the convent of the Dominicans, where they are still held.

==Designation as viceroy==
After the victory, the society stayed on military alert, suspecting that the British might counterattack. The Buenos Aires Cabildo called an open cabildo to discuss the next steps, including the actions to take regarding viceroy Sobremonte. They decided to prevent the viceroy from returning to the city, and appoint Liniers, who was regarded as a hero, as commander-in-chief. Sobremonte accepted, and moved to Montevideo. Liniers drafted all the male population capable of bearing arms, including African slaves, into the defense of the city. He arranged for each regiment to vote for its officers. All the lead in the city was confiscated (even pipes and cutlery) to be melted into ordnance. The Cabildo requested other cities to lend gunpowder, and the horses were trained to ignore the noise of cannon shots.

A new British task force, much larger than the first one, arrived the next year. It was led by Samuel Auchmuty, later replaced by John Whitelocke. This time they attacked Montevideo, which fell under their domination. The Real Audiencia of Buenos Aires decided to depose Sobremonte from his role as viceroy, confirmed Liniers as commander-in-chief, and appointed him as interim viceroy. It was an unprecedented action.

==Second British Invasion==
Once the Banda Oriental had been secured, the British prepared the attack on Buenos Aires. They were aware that the city was prepared for the invasion, but their forces were greater than in the first one, 23 ships and 11,000 soldiers. John Whitelocke, leader of the British forces, moved to Buenos Aires next to the River. Liniers left the city to battle him, being defeated, but managed to retreat and return to Buenos Aires. Álzaga, assuming that Liniers had died, put his defense plans in motion, and the morale of the troops rose when Liniers returned alive.
The British forced an entry into the city and encountered strong resistance, with many British battalions eventually being overwhelmed, while others tried to resist at strategic points. Whitelocke suggested a truce, which was rejected by Liniers, who also attacked the British ships within cannon range. Whitelocke&#x27;s defeat was complete, and Liniers demanded that all British forces be removed from the territories of Viceroyalty, including the Banda Oriental, in no more than 2 months, as well as an exchange of prisoners. Whitelocke accepted the conditions and surrendered.

==Government==

There was a large number of celebrations after the victory against the British. Liniers was officially appointed as viceroy in May 1808, and awarded the title of &quot;Count of Buenos Aires&quot;. However, this victory of the Argentine people which was obtained without any military help from Spain led to a new political situation in which some will for independence started to emerge. In this configuration Liniers, who appeared to be a fantastic leader during the emergency crisis, began to be criticized by the different parties including the conservative members of the Cabildo, led by Álzaga.

On one side, Spanish leaders criticized the new power of the Argentine people issued from the formation of criollo armies, and thought that Spanish influence was in danger. On the opposite side, criollo people who were asking for more independence, had some difficulty understanding the perfect sense of loyalty of a navy officer issued from old French nobility who intended to respect his oath to the king of Spain.

In this context, every action coming from Liniers became a source of criticism. As an example, his relation with Ana Périchon &quot;la pericona&quot; was severely pointed out, forcing him to lock her at her home and later to deport her to colonial Brazil. In the same spirit, his French birth became highly controversial when France invaded Spain, and started the Peninsular War, which included the removal of the Spanish king and queen by the French occupying forces. Despite the clear statements by Liniers of remaining loyal to the Spanish Empire and his refusal to accept Joseph Bonaparte as king, his political enemies created rumours that he was plotting to accept Bonaparte. They also promoted in the Río de la Plata the xenophobia that was taking place in Spain against the French, as an indirect means to attack Liniers and lower his prestige. The arrival of Sassenay, an agent of Napoleon seeking recognition for Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain, boosted rumors and controversy.

The criollo peoples promoted the Carlotist project, which tried to crown Charlotte of Spain, sister of Ferdinand, as Regent of the Spanish territories in the Americas, under a Constitutional monarchy. The project did not achieve success. The news of the creation of the Junta of Seville was seen by both criollos and peninsulars as a chance to create similar governments locally, but they had different perspectives on the political line such governments should have. Javier de Elío, governor of Montevideo and allied with Álzaga, created a Junta in the city. Álzaga set off a mutiny to do the same in Buenos Aires, but the forces under the command of Cornelio Saavedra defeated it and kept Liniers in power. Álzaga was jailed and the military bodies that took part in the mutiny were dissolved, which left only military bodies loyal to the criollos.

The Junta of Seville appointed a new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. Some Criollos proposed Liniers to resist the replacement with the forces under his command. It was considered that only a rightful king could appoint viceroys, and despite the circumstances of his designation Liniers had been confirmed in office by Charles IV; whereas Cisneros, appointed just by the Junta, may have lacked such legitimacy. However, Liniers rejected the proposal, and gave up government without resistance.

After leaving government, he retired from politics and moved to Córdoba province, settling in the town of Alta Gracia. However, he came out of his retirement shortly after, when news of the May Revolution arrived to the province.

==Counterrevolution and execution==
The governor of Córdoba, Juan Antonio Gutiérrez de la Concha, called for a meeting of the social elite of Córdoba, Liniers included, in order to discuss reactions towards the Primera Junta. At this time, Liniers&#x27;s father-in-law, Martín de Sarratea, wrote a letter to ask him to stay away from the counterrevolution, which he refused in the name of honour and respect to his word.

The Córdoba Cabildo gave recognition instead to the Regency Council of Cádiz, and Cisneros secretly gave authorization to Liniers to raise the viceroyalty against the Junta. Liniers wrote to other Royalist leaders, trying to organize the forces to fight against Buenos Aires. The Junta decided that, among the many enemies that could threaten it, Córdoba was the most dangerous, so an army led by Ortiz de Ocampo was sent to fight against it. However, there was no fighting: the counterrevolutionary army was severely damaged by espionage, desertions, and sabotage. The mere proximity of the troops from Buenos Aires caused the complete dispersion of the army gathered by Liniers. Liniers and the other top personnel of the counterrevolution tried to flee in multiple directions, but Ocampo captured them all.

Ocampo refused to execute the prisoners, aware of their popularity, so he delivered them to Buenos Aires as prisoners instead. The Junta feared the effect that the entry of Liniers into the city might have, so Juan José Castelli was sent, with orders to replace Ocampo and execute the prisoners. The execution took place at Cabeza de Tigre, on the border between Santa Fe and Córdoba.

==Legacy==

Liniers had been recognized in life with a street of Buenos Aires named after him, after the triumph against the British invasions. However, after the counterrevolution and the new number of heroes of the Argentine War of Independence, most names of such streets were modified in 1822, during the government of Martín Rodríguez. The former &quot;Liniers&quot; street consisted of the modern &quot;Defensa&quot; and &quot;Reconquista&quot; streets. The higher recognition to the heroes of the War of Independence stayed, but Liniers got renewed recognition with time. The Buenos Aires neighborhood of Liniers is named after him, as well as the Santiago de Liniers municipality in the Misiones Province.

In 1861, Queen Isabella II of Spain formally requested Liniers&#x27;s body from the Argentine Government. The remains were brought back to Spain and solemnly buried in the Panteón de Marinos Ilustres of the island of San Fernando, Cádiz. At this time, Liniers&#x27;s descendants received the hereditary title of &quot;Conde de la Lealtad&quot; (Count of Loyalty).

His house at Alta Gracia was abandoned after his death, and bought in 1820 by José Manuel Solares. His family kept it for a long time, until it was expropriated in 1969 and turned into a museum in 1977. It was declared a heritage of humanity by UNESCO on December 2, 2000.

<text>Yeongjo (; 31 October 1694 – 22 April 1776), personal name Yi Geum (), was the 21st monarch of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. He was the second son of King Sukjong by his concubine, Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Haeju Choe clan. Before ascending to power, he was known as Prince Yeoning (). His life was characterized by political infighting and resentment due to his biological mother&#x27;s low-born origins.

In 1720, a few months after the accession of his elder half-brother, Yi Yun (posthumously King Gyeongjong), as the 20th king, Yeoning became the crown prince. This induced a large controversy between the political factions. Nevertheless, four years later, at the death of Gyeongjong, he ascended to the throne.

Yeongjo is most remembered for his persistent attempts to reform the taxation system, and reconcile the various factions under his &quot;Tangpyeong&quot; policy (). His reign of nearly 52 years was also marked by the highly controversial execution of his only surviving son, Crown Prince Sado, in 1762. However, in spite of this controversy, Yeongjo has earned a positive reputation in Korean history due to his efforts to rule by Confucian ethics.

==Biography==
===Succession to the throne===
In 1720, King Sukjong died and Crown Prince Yi Yun, Sukjong&#x27;s eldest son, ascended to the throne as King Gyeongjong, at the age of 33. Before he died in 1720, Sukjong supposedly told Yi I-myeong to name Prince Yeoning as Gyeongjong&#x27;s heir, but in the absence of a historiographer or scribe, no record exists. At this time, the Noron faction unsuccessfully tried to pressure the new king to step down in favor of his younger half-brother.

A few months after Gyeongjong&#x27;s enthronement, Prince Yeoning was installed as Crown Prince Brother (&quot;Wangseje&quot;; 왕세제, 王世弟). This aggravated the power struggle and led to the of 1721. The Noron sent petitions to the king to no effect while the opposing Soron faction used this to their advantage — claiming the Noron were trying to usurp power and subsequently getting their rival faction removed from several offices.

Members of the Soron faction then came up with a plan to assassinate Yeoning under the pretence of hunting for a white fox said to be haunting the palace, but he sought shelter with his adoptive mother, Queen Dowager Hyesun. Afterwards, he told the king that he would rather go and live as a commoner.

On 11 October 1724, King Gyeongjong died. The Soron accused Yeoning of being involved in his brother&#x27;s death due to the earlier attempt of the Noron faction to have him placed on the throne. Many historians, however, now believe that he could have died from food poisoning caused by contaminated seafood, as he displayed symptoms of the illness. Homer Hulbert described this in his book &quot;The History of Korea,&quot; where he said, &quot;But we may well doubt the truth of the rumor, for nothing that is told of that brother indicates that he would commit such an act, and in the second place a man who will eat shrimps in mid-summer, that have been brought 30 miles from the sea without ice might expect to die&quot;. On 16 October 1724, Prince Yeoning ascended the throne as King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of Joseon.

===Reign===
He was a deeply Confucian monarch, and is said to have had a greater knowledge of the classics than his officials. During the reigns of Yeongjo and his grandson Jeongjo, Confucianization was at its height, as well as the economic recovery from the wars of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. His reign was referred to by American missionary Homer Hulbert as &quot;one of the most brilliant&quot; in Joseon&#x27;s history.

Yeongjo worried deeply for his people. The Annals of the Joseon dynasty record that one day in the 4th year of his reign, King Yeongjo woke up to the sound of early morning rain and said to his courtiers:

Oh dear! We have had flood, drought and famines for the past four years because of my lack of virtue, and this year we even went through an unprecedented revolt by a traitor named Yi In-jwa. How can my poor people manage their livelihood under such hardship? There is an old saying, &#x27;War is always followed by a lean year&#x27;. Fortunately, however, we haven&#x27;t had a big famine for the past two years and we pin our hopes on a good harvest this year. Yet I am still nervous because, while the season for harvesting is around the corner, there is no way of knowing if there will be a flood or drought before then. Nobody knows whether a cold rain will pour suddenly and flood the fields awaiting harvest. My lack of goodness might bring upon us such awful things as I fail to win the sympathy of heaven. How can I earn the sympathy of heavens if I do not self-reflect and make efforts myself? I should start with reflecting on myself.

As he worried that rain would ruin the harvest and force his unfortunate people to starve, the king ordered his courtiers to reduce the taxes and decrease the number of dishes in his own meals.

One early morning 25 years later (1753), the continuous rain reminded Yeongjo of the flood during the fourth year of his reign, when he had eaten less food:

Oh! Floods and droughts really happen because I lack virtue. I am much older than that year, but how can my compassion for the people and will to work hard for them be less than back then?&quot;.

Yet again, he ordered a reduction in the number of dishes on his dining table.

People around him described him as an articulate, bright, benevolent and kind monarch. He was penetrating in observation and quick of comprehension.

===Yi In-jwa&#x27;s Rebellion===
After the ascension of King Yeongjo to the throne, the position of the Noron faction was restored, and a coalition of the radical faction of the Namin and the excluded Soron faction instigated Yi In-jwa&#x27;s Rebellion under the pretext of protecting King Gyeongjong. Yeongjo pursued a policy of equal recruitment, believing that factional strife was detrimental to the country&#x27;s development. In response, the radical faction of the Soron group justified their rebellion by raising suspicions about the circumstances of King Gyeongjong&#x27;s death and claiming that King Yeongjo was not the legitimate heir of King Sukjong, thereby securing their power. The rebellion began on March 15 when their leader, Yi In-jwa captured Cheongju Castle. The rebel forces, marching toward Hanyang (present-day Seoul), were defeated by the royal army, and the support from the Yeong and Honam regions was also suppressed by local forces, leading to the suppression of the rebellion and execution of Yi In-jwa and his family.

===Policies===
Realising the detrimental effect on state administration of the factional strife, Yeongjo attempted to end it as soon as he ascended the throne. He reinstated the short-lived universal military service tax, and then went beyond the palace gates to solicit the opinions of officials, literati (scholars), soldiers and peasants. Yeongjo reduced the military service tax by half and ordered the variance be supplemented by taxes on fisheries, salt, vessels and an additional land tax. He also regularized the financial system of state revenues and expenses by adopting an accounting system. His pragmatic policies allowed payment of taxes on grain from the remote mountainous areas Gyeongsang Province, to the nearby port, with payment in cotton or cash for grain. The circulation of currency was encouraged by increasing coin casting.

Yeongjo&#x27;s concern for improvement of the peasant&#x27;s life was manifest in his eagerness to educate the people by distributing important books in the Korean script (Hangul), including the &quot;Book of Agriculture&quot;.

The pluviometer was again manufactured in quantity and distributed to local administration offices and extensive public work projects were undertaken. Yeongjo upgraded the status of posterity of the commoners, opening another possibility for upward social mobility and inevitable change. His policies were intended to reassert the Confucian monarchy and a humanistic rule, but they were unable to stem the tide of social change that resulted.

Mercantile activities rapidly increased in volume. The accumulation of capital through monopoly and wholesales expanded through guild organisations and many merchants were centred in Hanseong. The traditional division of government chartered shop, the license tribute goods suppliers and the small shopkeepers in the alley and streets were integrated and woven into a monopoly and wholesale system.

Regardless of status, many yangban aristocrats and commoners engaged in some kind of merchant activities. Thus Hanseong made great strides as a commercial and industrial city and hub in the 18th century. The popular demand for handicrafts and goods such as knives, mane hats, dining tables and brassware was ever-increasing. Restrictions on wearing the mane hat originally denoting yangban status, virtually disappeared.

Even bootlegging of books became commercialised as competition developed among the well-to-do yangban who engaged in the publication of collected literary works by their renowned ancestors. This also led to printing popular fiction and poetry. The people especially appreciated satire and social criticism. One example is the &quot;Chunhyangjeon&quot; (Tales of Chunghyang) about the fidelity of the gisaeng&#x27;s daughter, which was widely read as a satire aimed to expose the greed and snobbery of government officials.

====Anti-corruption====
The King is also renowned for having treasured Park Mun-su, whom he appointed as secret royal inspector (&quot;Amhaengeosa&quot;; 암행어사). Park, who had earned great merit in putting down Yi In-jwa&#x27;s rebellion in 1728, went around the nation arresting corrupt local officers in the name of the King.

==== Catholicism ====
Yeongjo was the first king to take action against Roman Catholic activities in the country. By the 18th century, Catholicism was beginning to acquire a following especially in the Gangwon and Hwanghae provinces. In 1758, Yeongjo officially outlawed Catholicism as an evil practice.

===Crown Prince Sado===
The only significantly dismal incident during Yeongjo&#x27;s reign was the death of his son, Crown Prince Sado. History indicates Sado suffered from mental illness, randomly killing people in the palace and raping palace maids. Because Yeongjo could not execute his son without also implicating his daughter-in-law and grandson, he ordered Sado to climb into a wooden rice chest on a hot July day in 1762. After two days, King Yeongjo had the chest containing Sado tied with rope, covered with grass, and moved to the upper palace. Sado responded from inside the chest until the night of the seventh day; the chest was opened and he was pronounced dead on the eighth day. During the 19th century, there were rumors that Crown Prince Sado had not been mentally ill, but had been victimised by a court plot. This, however, is contradicted by both the memoirs written by Sado&#x27;s widow and the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.

As a means to preserve the legitimacy of Sado&#x27;s son as his own heir, Yeongjo decreed that the boy be registered as the son of the deceased Crown Prince Hyojang and Crown Princess Consort Hyosun.

===Death===
Yeongjo had lived with poor health for much of his life, and was even infected with parasitic worms. Because of this, he took many precautions to stay healthy, which some speculate may have contributed to his death at a relatively old age.

Fourteen years after Crown Prince Sado&#x27;s death, his son and Yeongjo&#x27;s grandson, Yi San (posthumously King Jeongjo), became King. The early part of the new King&#x27;s years were marked by political intrigues and fear of court officials who were afraid that he would seek revenge on them for petitioning the punishment that caused the death of his father, Crown Prince Sado.

Yeongjo is buried with his second wife, Queen Jeongsun, in the royal tomb of Wonneung () in Guri, Gyeonggi Province.

<doc id="1119963" wikidata="Q4799614" url="?curid=1119963" title="Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.">
<text>Arthur Meier Schlesinger ( ; February 27, 1888 – October 30, 1965) was an American historian who taught at Harvard University, pioneering social history and urban history. He was a Progressive Era intellectual who stressed material causes (such as economic profit and conflict between businessmen and farmers) and downplayed ideology and values as motivations for historical actors. He was highly influential as a director of PhD dissertations at Harvard for three decades, especially in the fields of social, women&#x27;s, and immigration history. His son, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. (1917–2007), also taught at Harvard and was a noted historian.

==Life and career==
Schlesinger&#x27;s father, Bernhard Schlesinger, was a Prussian Jew, and his mother, Kate ( Feurle), was an Austrian Catholic. The two converted to Protestantism together and emigrated to Xenia, Ohio, in 1872.

He was born in Xenia, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio State University in 1910. While a student at Ohio State, he was initiated into the Ohio Zeta chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He got his PhD in history at Columbia University, where he was influenced by both Herbert L. Osgood and Charles A. Beard. He taught at Ohio State and the University of Iowa before he joined the faculty of Harvard University as a professor of history in 1924, succeeded Frederick Jackson Turner and taught at Harvard until 1954. Harvard&#x27;s Schlesinger Library in women&#x27;s history is named after him and his wife, Elizabeth, a noted feminist. He became an editor of the &quot;New England Quarterly&quot; in 1928. That same year, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1941.

In Boston in 1929, city officials, under the leadership of James Curley, threatened to arrest Margaret Sanger if she spoke on birth control. In response, she stood on stage, silent with a gag over her mouth, while her speech was read by Schlesinger.

He enjoyed strong family ties and commitment. His two sisters, Olga and Marion Etna, became schoolteachers and made it possible for their three younger brothers (George, Arthur, and Hugo) to attend college graduating in engineering, history and law. One of his sons was born Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger and replaced his middle name with &quot;Meier,&quot; adding Jr., later in life.

Schlesinger died at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Ideas==
He pioneered social history and urban history. He was a Progressive Era intellectual who stressed material causes (like economic profit) and downplayed ideology and values as motivations for historical actors. He was highly influential as a director of PhD dissertations at Harvard for three decades, especially in the fields of social, women&#x27;s, and immigration history. He commented in 1922, &quot;From reading history in textbooks one would think half of our population made only a negligible contribution to history.&quot; He promoted social history by co-editing the 13-volume &quot;History of American Life&quot; (1928–1943) series with Dixon Ryan Fox. These thick volumes, written by leading young scholars, mostly avoid politics, individuals, and constitutional issues. They instead focus on such topics as society, demographics, economic, housing, fashion, sports, education, and cultural life.

In &quot;Tides of American Politics,&quot; a provocative essay in the &quot;Yale Review&quot; in 1939, he presented his cyclical view of history which identified irregular oscillations between liberal and conservative national moods, but it attracted few historians apart from his son. Schlesinger introduced the idea of polling historians to rank presidential greatness, which attracted much attention.

In an essay on &quot;The Significance of Jacksonian Democracy&quot; (in &quot;New Viewpoints in American History&quot; (1922)), Schlesinger drew attention to the fact that &quot;while democracy was working out its destiny in the forests of the Mississippi Valley, the men left behind in the eastern cities were engaging in a struggle to establish conditions of equality and social well-being adapted to their special circumstances.&quot;

As a historian of the rise of the city in American life, he argued that for a full understanding of the Jacksonian democratic movement: &quot;It is necessary to consider the changed circumstances of life of the common man in the new industrial centers of the East since the opening years of the nineteenth century.&quot; That was a challenge to the frontier thesis of his Harvard colleague Frederick Jackson Turner. In Schlesinger&#x27;s essay, the common man of the Mississippi Valley and the common man of eastern industrialism stood uneasily side by side. Schlesinger characterized prejudice against Catholics as &quot;the deepest bias in the history of the American people&quot;.

Schlesinger and his students took a group approach to history, sharply downplaying the role of individuals. Groups were defined by ethnicity (Germans, Irish, Jews, Italians, Hispanics, etc.) or by class (working class, middle class). Their model was that the urban environment, including the interaction with other groups, shaped their history and group outlook in deterministic fashion.

<text>The Guild of One-Name Studies is a UK-based charitable organisation founded in 1979 for one-name studies.

==History==
The Guild developed as an offshoot of the Federation of Family History Societies. The FFHS was founded on 8 June 1974. By 1977 one-third of the members of the FFHS were one-name societies, and a sub-committee was set up to address the needs of this group. Among its duties was the generation of a Register of Surnames which were being comprehensively studied.

The first one-name conference was held at the Grand Hotel in Leicester from 13 to 14 May 1978. Sixty-six participants attended the inaugural conference. A formal resolution was carried unanimously to establish a Guild of individuals engaged in one-name research. The Guild was officially launched in Plymouth, Devon, on 1 September 1979 during a conference hosted by the family history societies of Devon and Cornwall. Within a few months, approximately 200 members had enrolled in the Guild. To qualify for registration, one needed to have a significant body of data relating to the given surname and its variants. It was suggested that entries be extracted from current telephone directories, civil registration indexes of births, marriages and deaths, and national probate indexes such as the Prerogative Courts of Canterbury and York.
The decision to call it a guild was partly inspired by the notion that medieval guilds had encouraged professionalism along with mutual aid, as well as by a whimsical desire to create the acronym GOONS, evoking a popular British radio humorous show, &quot;The Goon Show,&quot; and making a self-mocking comment on the quixotic nature of one-name studies.

As a small organisation, the Guild has no employed staff. It has co-operated closely with the Halsted Trust, created by legacy, which promotes one-name studies.

While one-name studies have mainly been popular in Britain, thanks to that country&#x27;s unified and open vital records, the Guild has always officially insisted that every study it recognises should be worldwide in scope, and has sought to cater for non-British studies in its basic methodological advice.

==One-name studies==

A one-name study is a project researching all occurrences of a surname, as opposed to a particular pedigree (ancestors of one person) or descendancy (descendants of one person or couple). Some &quot;one-namers&quot; may restrict their research geographically, perhaps to one country, but to register a surname with the Guild a member must commit to researching on a world-wide basis.

Typically, the researchers will also study the etymology of the surname, and its geographical distribution. Sometimes, especially if the surname is also a place name, they will try to identify the place or places of origin of the surname, employing the normal methods of genealogy.

A small core of Guild members are combining their traditional documentary research with a DNA project. By the end of 2009 some 200 DNA surname projects were led by Guild members.

One-name study researchers are also increasingly making use of online networking services such as Facebook to make connections with other people researching their surname.

==Activities==
The principal meeting places of the Guild are its on-line mailing list - the Guild Email Forum, an active Members only Facebook Group and its Seminars and Annual Conferences, which are mostly held in England. There is also a Facebook page which non-members can view and contact the Guild. As an organisation, its principal role has been to debate and distribute advice on methods for one-name studies. Members have collated a wiki of such advice, but this is not yet publicly available.

To meet the concern of members that one-name compilations are often lost to posterity when researchers die and their papers are destroyed, the &quot;Guild Archive&quot;, an electronic repository for members&#x27; one-name records, has been created and guidelines laid down on bequests of digital data to the Guild.

The &quot;Guild Marriage Index&quot;, a facility to help members find the names of marriage partners and identify from index numbers where post-1837 marriages took place in England and Wales, is likely to become the Guild&#x27;s main contribution to the wider field of family history.

==Publications==
The Guild&#x27;s initial periodical was the &quot;Guild of One-Name Studies Newsletter&quot;, published quarterly for eight issues from January 1980 to October 1981 on corner-stapled, typescript foolscap sheets under editor Frank Higenbottam.

This was followed by the &quot;Journal of One-Name Studies&quot;, with binding, also quarterly, from 1982 to the present. Its current editor (2016-) is Jean-Marc Bazzoni.The &quot;Register of One-Name Studies&quot; published annually, lists all one-name studies currently registered by Guild members. The Guild also publishes booklets of advice such as &quot;Organising a One-Name Gathering&quot;.
The Guild published &quot;Your Research Surname Guide - How to do a One-Name Study&quot; with the April 2019 edition of Family Tree Magazine (UK).

In September 2019, the Guild published a revised and extended edition, called &quot;Researching Surnames - A Guide to One-Name Studies&quot;, both of these guides were written by Julie Goucher.

==Membership==
Membership of the Guild is open to anyone interested in one-name studies. Members may register their one-name study surnames with the Guild if they wish, provided those surnames are not currently registered. However registration of a surname is not a condition of membership.

At its foundation, the Guild had about 200 members. At present (2022), it has 2,516 members. Study surnames are listed in a Register of One-Name Studies, published both on-line and on paper. The Register shows that slightly more than 2,300 studies are being conducted involving a total of about 8,200 surnames and variants. A considerable number of early members have retired or died, and their studies, additional to this number, have therefore ceased - though the Guild offers all members the possibility of preserving their research materials.

Some 20 per cent of the membership present their findings through websites. Guild members can also publicise their studies through profiles created on the Guild&#x27;s website. As an indicator of digitised methods, 80 per cent of the members have an e-mail address registered with the Guild.

The addresses of members show the bulk to be living in Britain, but with significant numbers in North America, Australia and New Zealand.

The first settlement was on the Santa Joana River, and also called Santa Joana. It was later known as Boa Família and finally as Itaguaçu.

A later wave of settlement came with the Italian immigration to Brazil of the late 19th century. Several families from San Cassiano de Treviso in the Italian province of Treviso. They worked for another native of Treviso in Santa Catarina for three years before twelve families moved to Boa Família in 1882.

<doc id="1119973" wikidata="Q5879167" url="?curid=1119973" title="Hold Me (Laura Branigan album)">
<text>Hold Me is the fourth studio album by American singer Laura Branigan, released on July 15, 1985, by Atlantic Records. The album peaked at number 71 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, though it fared better internationally, reaching the top 10 in Sweden and Switzerland, and the top 15 in Norway.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Spanish Eddie&quot;, earned Branigan her sixth top-40 entry in two and a half years, peaking at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was moderately successful outside the United States. Subsequent singles &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;I Found Someone&quot; failed to make an impact, peaking at numbers 82 and 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. Nevertheless, &quot;Hold Me&quot; reached number 39 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance/Disco Club Play chart, while &quot;I Found Someone&quot; reached number 25 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart.

The track &quot;When the Heat Hits the Streets&quot; was used in a television advertising campaign for the Chrysler Laser, with Chrysler serving as a sponsor for Branigan&#x27;s 1985–1986 Hold Me tour (a Chrysler Laser was prominently displayed in the &quot;Spanish Eddie&quot; music video).

According to Branigan, she said &quot;the album is such a growth from my other albums. I really feel it’s the direction I want to go. My voice is definitely stronger and the material is just incredible. I honestly don&#x27;t feel there are any fillers.&quot;

==Reception==

In their review of the album, &quot;Billboard&quot; commented that &quot;Branigan&#x27;s latest includes several tracks by co-producer Harold Faltermeyer, giving the collection an added edge beyond the mainstream ballads and rockers that have characterized her earlier recordings. First single is &quot;Spanish Eddie,&quot; but
the album should produce several other successful tracks, most notably &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m With
You.&quot; 

&quot;Cashbox&quot; noted that &quot;Laura Branigan&#x27;s fourth LP for Atlantic combines all of the elements that have brought her a handful of hit singles, from uptempo dance oriented tunes such as this album’s first single, the melodic and colorful “Spanish Eddie,” to beautiful ballads like “Forever Young.” Producer Jack White and other contributors like Harold Faltermeyer have chosen some excellent material here and Branigan shines on every cut.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; were more mixed in their review, stating that &quot;Laura Branigan began to falter in her quest to be the white, &#x27;80s Donna Summer with her fourth album, which failed to scale the sales heights of her first three, despite another clutch of dramatic, heavily produced Eurodisco tracks, three of which found their way onto the singles charts. The closest thing to a hit was &quot;Spanish Eddie&quot; (this album&#x27;s remake of her first smash, &quot;Gloria&quot;), a song with an odd street-life lyric that made reference to Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Desolation Row&quot;...Elsewhere, Branigan again turned to songwriter Michael Bolton for &quot;I Found Someone,&quot; and as she had with &quot;How Am I Supposed To Live Without You,&quot; did it much better than its author, for what it&#x27;s worth. But on the whole, &quot;Hold Me&quot; found The Branigan formula growing stale.&quot;

<doc id="1119979" wikidata="Q4886065" url="?curid=1119979" title="Ben B. Lindsey">
<text>Benjamin Barr Lindsey (November 25, 1869 – March 26, 1943) was an American judge and social reformer based in Denver during the Progressive Era.

==Early life==
Benjamin Barr Lindsey was born in Jackson, Tennessee, to former Confederate captain Landy Tunstall Lindsey. He was educated in the public schools and attended Southwest Baptist University (now Union University). His father committed suicide when Ben was 18, leaving him the sole support of his mother and her three younger children. He obtained employment in a real-estate office in Denver, where he studied law in his spare time. In despair over his slow progress in his law studies, he attempted suicide, but his gun misfired. In 1894, he entered the practice of law in Denver. In his work, he was often assisted by his wife, Henrietta, whom he had married in 1914. He was appointed to a vacancy in the county court in 1900.

==Juvenile court==
Lindsey was a pioneer in the establishment of the juvenile court system. Through his efforts, an act was passed creating a juvenile court in Denver which represented an important advance in relation of the law to children and would go on to serve as a model for future juvenile courts across America. Lindsey was made judge of the juvenile court in 1901 (which became a juvenile and family relations court in 1907). He held the position continuously, but he was not endorsed by either political party in 1908.

Among other measures to which Lindsey contributed his influence were a reform of the registration law, greatly reducing election frauds; a reform of the ballot; state provisions for the support of the dependents of people serving in prison; extension of the probation system for prisoners; organization of public baths and playgrounds in Denver; the institution of the fresh-air movement in Denver; and enactment of statewide Mother&#x27;s Pension Law.

He was a leader in the movement to abolish child labor. He carried on an active propaganda for the general adoption of the juvenile court plan, and for political and social reform, through lectures delivered in many American and foreign cities and through the publication of books and pamphlets, of which &quot;The Beast&quot; (with Harvey J. O&#x27;Higgins, 1910) was widely circulated. In 1906, Lindsey was a candidate for governor of Colorado, and in 1912 became a member of the Progressive National Committee.

==Companionate marriage==
In early 1927, Lindsey co-wrote a controversial book about what he called &quot;The Companionate Marriage&quot;, in which he suggested that young men and women should be able to live together in a trial marriage, where the couple could have a year to evaluate whether or not they were suitable with each other. The only caveat was they had to agree not to have children. If after a year, the couple decided to stay together, they could do so, but if the relationship didn&#x27;t work out, they would be able to dissolve the relationship easily. Also, if they decided they were compatible and did want children, they could change the status of their relationship to a traditionally understood marriage.

Since one of the most common discourses in the popular culture was about women having children, and many clergy believed that sexual intercourse within marriage should only be for purposes of procreation, Lindsey&#x27;s essay aroused strong emotions; a number of priests and ministers, as well as civic leaders accused him of promoting immorality, promiscuity and free love, charges that he denied. At one point, even the Pope spoke out against him. Bertrand Russell, in his 1929 book &quot;Marriage and Morals&quot;, wrote approvingly of Lindsey&#x27;s proposals but observed that they &quot;were received with a howl of horror by all middle-aged persons and most of the newspapers throughout the length and breadth of America.&quot; In Denver, he was ousted from the bench, after 28 years of service. &quot;Time&quot; expressed the view that his views on companionate marriage had destroyed his reputation. Lindsey continued to defend his views on radio and in a series of speaking engagements.

==In popular culture==
In 1919, Lindsey wrote the introduction to &quot;Madeleine: An Autobiography&quot;, the memoirs of former prostitute Madeleine Blair, an exposé of brothels in the 19th-century American West.

Judge Lindsey appeared as himself in the film &quot;The Soul of Youth&quot; (1920), directed by William Desmond Taylor, and in &quot;Judge Ben Lindsey in the Juvenile Court&quot; (1921), the latter film made in the experimental Photokinema sound-on-disc process.

&quot;Benjamin Barr Lindsey&quot;, episode 24 of the historical docudrama TV series &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, based upon John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, was broadcast on April 25, 1965, with George Grizzard portraying Lindsey in 1906, at the time of his advocacy for juvenile justice reform.

He is a recurring character in the songs of Denver folk/country artist Jay Munly, appearing in songs such as &quot;Circle Round My Bedside&quot; and &quot;Bonnie Clyde, the Big Bull-Hen of the Women&#x27;s Prison&quot;.

== Later years ==
In 1929, Lindsey was disbarred in Colorado for accepting money for legal services while serving as a judge. On December 7, 1930, he was arrested for disorderly conduct after disrupting public worship at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. His interruption came after Bishop William T. Manning denounced Lindsey&#x27;s stance on marriage in his sermon. In 1934, he ran for, and won election to a judgeship in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. He also continued his advocacy for children in the juvenile justice system. He died in Los Angeles, of a heart attack, at age 73.

<doc id="1120000" wikidata="Q505326" url="?curid=1120000" title="Pancas">
<text>Pancas is a Brazilian municipality in the state of Espírito Santo. Its population was 23,306 (2020) and its area is 838 km2. East Pomeranian, a dialect of Low German, has co-official status in Pancas.

It is situated on a tributary of the Doce River, in the northwest of the state. Locally it is known as a good spot for paragliding. The landscape around the town is distinguished by large numbers of granite inselbergs, and Pedra Agulha (&quot;Needle Rock&quot;) near the town is the second highest &quot;chaminé&quot; (high, vertical-sided granite rock) in Brazil - the highest being the famous Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro.
==History==
Before the European colonizers arrived, the area was inhabited by Amerindians. The first European settlers founded a village called São Silvano, but that was destroyed by the local Amerindians. The first permanent residents arrived in 1918 looking for valuable minerals, but the region of the Doce River was practically uninhabited till 1925, it was then that the first bridge over the Doce River was built, called Florian Avidos Bridge, and this brought more people into the north of the state for the first time. The bridge primarily opened access to logging companies which brought more people and coffee plantations, opening their way to the valley where Pancas is situated. The first settlement in the area was founded in 1925, and was called Nossa Senhora Da Penha.

Immigrants to the town in the 1920s and 1930 included large numbers of ethnic Germans, and the German dialect of East Pomeranian (now almost extinct in Europe) is spoken in the area.

<doc id="1120003" wikidata="Q1432648" url="?curid=1120003" title="Montreal Metropolitan Airport">
<text>MET – Montreal Metropolitan Airport (), formerly known as Montréal Saint-Hubert - Longueuil Airport (Aéroport Montréal Saint-Hubert - Longueuil) or Montréal/Saint-Hubert Airport, and still commonly referred to as St-Hubert airport, is located in the Saint-Hubert borough of Longueuil, Quebec. The airport is located east of Downtown Montreal and east of downtown Longueuil.

As of 2023, it is ranked as Canada&#x27;s 12th busiest airport by aircraft movements. This airport mainly serves travelers to Quebec destinations.

The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) on a call-out basis from Montréal–Mirabel International Airport. CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.

==History==
Canada became involved in the Imperial Airship Scheme during the 1926 Imperial Conference, when Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King pledged Canada’s assistance to Great Britain. Money was set aside for the construction of an airship base, airport and mooring mast in eastern Canada. British experts came over in May 1927 to choose a site; they visited a number of locations in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, finally settling on a piece of land on the south shore of Montreal, at Saint-Hubert, and officially announcing this decision in August 1927. Work on the airfield began almost immediately and Saint-Hubert’s first airmail delivery took place in November 1927.

It was also during the summer of 1927 that the Air Ministry decided to send the R100 to Canada. On August 1, 1930, the R100 airship arrived after what was possibly the first non-stop passenger-carrying powered flight across the North Atlantic to land in Canada.

In the late 1930s the airport was used by Canadian Associated Aircraft to build the Handley Page Hampden. 

Canada’s first air traffic control tower opened at the Saint-Hubert Airport on April 13, 1939. It was Montreal&#x27;s first and only airport until the opening of Dorval Airport (now Montréal–Trudeau International Airport) in 1941.
The airport was divided into two sides, a military side along with the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada facility (facing runway 06L/24R) and a civilian side (facing runway 06R/24L). Today the military base, the former RCAF Station St Hubert, has ceased operations, but the Armed Forces still use the base as a garrison comprising the tactical helicopter unit, 438 Squadron, 34 Service Battalion and 34 Canadian Brigade Group Headquarters. The ex-Pratt &amp; Whitney hangar is owned and operated since 2012 as the largest FBO on the airport by an AvJet branded dealer: CYHU H-18 Services Inc. Their hangar is the newest addition to the FBO network: HUB FBO.

Following the new National Airports Policy announced by Transport Canada in 1994, ownership of the airport was transferred to a private corporation, &quot;Développement de l&#x27;aéroport Saint-Hubert de Longueuil&quot; (DASH-L), on September 1, 2004.

It was here that the body of Quebec Minister of Labour and Deputy Premier, Pierre Laporte, was found during the October Crisis of 1970.

=== Recent upgrades ===
In 2018, the runway was upgraded to accommodate larger aircraft and attract low cost carriers. It was announced on February 27, 2023 that Porter Airlines will develop a new passenger terminal at the airport that is due to be completed in late 2025 and provide domestic flights throughout Canada.

In 2024, it was unveiled that Saint-Hubert Airport would be rebranded to the Metropolitan Airport of Montreal (Aéroport métropolitain de Montréal) and use the abbreviation &quot;MET&quot;.

== Accidents ==

* On March 17, 2017, about 13:00 EDT (17:00 UTC), a midair collision occurred on the southeastern side of the airport, over the city of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville. The two planes collided at an approximate altitude of over the Promenades Saint-Bruno, both aircraft were Cessna 152, owned by Cargair, a flight training school. One plane crashed on the rooftop of the shopping mall, injuring the pilot. The other crashed in the parking lot, killing the pilot. The owner of Cargair indicated that both pilots involved in the crash were from China.

<doc id="1120005" wikidata="Q7828567" url="?curid=1120005" title="Touch (Laura Branigan album)">
<text>Touch is the fifth studio album by American singer Laura Branigan, released on July 7, 1987, by Atlantic Records. The album saw Branigan&#x27;s return to dancefloors with the lead single, the Stock Aitken Waterman-produced &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, which was released in June 1987 and reached number 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album&#x27;s second single, a cover of Jennifer Rush&#x27;s &quot;Power of Love&quot;, was released in October 1987, peaking at number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Spirit of Love&quot; was released as a single in Europe, while &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; served as the album&#x27;s third single in the United States.

==Reception==

In their review of the album, &quot;Billboard&quot; commented &quot;pop songstress gets to showcase her strongest assets here: powerful, sustained vocals and convincing lyric interpretation. The results fit best with adult contemporary; album offers more ballads than usual. Best bets: &quot;Shattered Glass,&quot; produced by Stock, Aitken, Waterman; &quot;Over Love &quot; and &quot;Spirit Of Love.&quot; 

&quot;Cashbox&quot; praised the album, stating that &quot;international favorite backs off of her signature disco sonics allowing her dramatic, often plaintive vocals to shine through. The song selection on &quot;Touch&quot; ranges from delicate, introspective heart surgeries to full force gale blowers on which she exercises the breadth of her amazing range.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; noted that &quot;Laura Branigan&#x27;s fifth album, Touch, showed signs of maturity as she made a bid (that was not quite successful) for adult contemporary crossover - a smart chance to take considering the longevity many A/C acts have. Her big, boomy voice is perfect for some of the moody ballads on this collection, such as &quot;Over Love,&quot; &quot;Meaning of the Word,&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Love,&quot; but there are so many of those successfully evocative cuts that the dance songs don&#x27;t fit as seamlessly as they should. That&#x27;s not to say the upbeat tracks are not in good shape: The lead single, &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; and &quot;Angels Calling&quot; stand out; you can hardly hold back from caroling along. Synthesizer-heavy throughout, on both the slow and fast songs, the strings on the yearning &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; near the end of the album are welcome. The lyrics on many of the cuts are poetic and adult, making this atmospheric collection the best product she&#x27;d released so far; the material is far better suited to her voice - which has never sounded better.&quot;

==Track listing==
All tracks produced by David Kershenbaum, except &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; and &quot;Whatever I Do&quot;, produced by Stock Aitken Waterman; additional production on &quot;Name Game&quot; by Albert Cabrera and Tony Moran.

<text>Laura Branigan is the sixth studio album by American singer Laura Branigan, released on March 21, 1990, by Atlantic Records. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Moonlight on Water&quot;, reached number 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the second single, &quot;Never in a Million Years&quot;, peaked at number 22 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. The third and final single, a cover version of Vicki Sue Robinson&#x27;s 1976 song &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;, failed to chart. The song &quot;Unison&quot; was recorded by Celine Dion the same year.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; praised the album for its &quot;jaunty, up-tempo dance tunes&quot; but noted that &quot;Branigan still excels at shimmering tear jerker ballads like &#x27;Never in a Million Years&#x27; and &#x27;No Promise, No Guarantee&#x27;.&quot;

In their review of the album, &quot;Cashbox&quot; noted that &quot;Branigan rolled out some heavyweight producers who are known for delivering the goods,&quot; and that &quot;this is one of the most solid efforts she has produced, ranging from the ballads for which she&#x27;s known to a more conscious effort to court the dance crowd.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; were much more critical in their review, &quot;short on ideas even with a three-year layoff (they couldn&#x27;t even think of an album title!), the Laura Branigan brain trust put its faith in drum programs to carry a collection of mediocre originals, a lame cover of Vicki Sue Robinson&#x27;s dance classic &quot;Turn the Beat Around,&quot; and a Bryan Adams castoff. Branigan sang with her usual gusto, but even slick producers like Richard Perry and Peter Wolf couldn&#x27;t animate the material.&quot;

<doc id="1120019" wikidata="Q3125892" url="?curid=1120019" title="Hal March">
<text>Hal March (born Harold Mendelson; April 22, 1920 – January 19, 1970) was an American comedian, actor, and television quiz show emcee.

==Early career==
March entered show business as a straight man in the vaudeville act the Hollywood Rioteers, before serving in the U.S. Army beginning in 1941. He began his career in broadcasting as an announcer at Station KYA in San Francisco. From 1944 through 1948 he teamed with comedy partner Bob Sweeney in &quot;The Bob Sweeney-Hal March Show&quot; on CBS Radio. He also appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot;, which ran on CBS 1946–1949.

March co-starred as Harry Morton on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; on the NBC and CBS radio networks from the mid-1940s until 1950. When the show switched to television that year, he continued in the role until the middle of the season, in 1951. During the next few seasons, he appeared occasionally in various guest roles on the show.

March and Mary Jane Croft co-starred in &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot;, a summer replacement program on CBS radio in 1950. The comedy centered on Douglas and Carrie Cook and their 10 children.

He went on to appear on such shows as &quot;The Imogene Coca Show&quot;, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, and &quot;Willy&quot;. In the summer of 1955, March joined John Dehner and Tom D&#x27;Andrea in the 11-episode NBC summer series, &quot;The Soldiers&quot;, a military comedy produced and directed by Bud Yorkin. D&#x27;Andrea temporarily left the William Bendix sitcom &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; for this chance at his own series.

He was the Mystery Guest on the October 9, 1955 episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; He was guessed by Bennett Cerf.

==&quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;==
March was arguably best known as the host of &quot;The $64,000 Question,&quot; which he helmed from 1955 to 1958. In addition to his hosting duties, March also sang a version of the show&#x27;s theme music in 1956, titled &quot;Love Is the Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Question.&quot;

As a result of the quiz show scandals, the show was canceled, and with the exception of a few film roles such as &quot;Hear Me Good&quot; and &quot;Send Me No Flowers,&quot; March was largely out of work for nearly a decade.

==Later career==
To keep busy, March continued to appear in guest-starring roles, even starring in a 1961 unsold television pilot for a comedy titled &quot;I Married a Dog,&quot; in which his life was constantly upset by his wife&#x27;s pooch. He appeared in several sitcoms in 1966 that are still widely rerun today. Among these are a role as the father of Gidget&#x27;s boyfriend Jeff in the &quot;Gidget&quot; episode &quot;In and Out with the In-Laws&quot; and the head of corrupt dance studio in &quot;The Monkees&quot; episode &quot;Dance Monkee, Dance.&quot; He also made appearances in the sitcoms &quot;Hey, Landlord&quot; and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; as well as in the film &quot;A Guide for the Married Man.&quot;

In 1961, he played the lead in Neil Simon&#x27;s first Broadway play &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;, which ran for 677 performances.

==Death==
March&#x27;s career took a turn for the better in July 1969 when he began hosting the game show &quot;It&#x27;s Your Bet&quot;. After completing approximately 13 weeks of taping, however, he complained of exhaustion. Tests revealed that he had lung cancer, the result of years of chain smoking. He had one lung removed. When he subsequently contracted pneumonia, he was too weak to fight it. March died in January 1970 in Los Angeles at age 49, and is buried in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Accolades==
March was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for his radio work at 1560 Vine Street, and another for his work in television at 6536 Hollywood Boulevard.

== Personal life ==
In 1956, March married Candy Toxton, the former wife of singer Mel Tormé. March was stepfather to Toxton&#x27;s two children from her previous marriage, Steve March-Tormé and Melissa Tormé. He and Toxton had three children together: Peter, Jeffrey, and Victoria.

His grandson Hunter March hosted the game show &quot;Emogenius&quot;. He also hosts the Netflix series &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; and E! TV&#x27;s &quot;Nightly Pop&quot;.

<text>Joseph Andrew Unanue (March 14, 1925 – June 12, 2013) was an American-born son of Spanish parents who was the president of Goya Foods, the largest Hispanic–owned food company in the United States. 

After a Catholic upbringing and education in New York, Unanue served in the United States Army during World War II, and was awarded the Bronze star for bravery. He subsequently returned to New York and joined the company his father had founded, Goya Foods. He rose to become president in 1978, a position he held until 2004.

Unanue was made a knight of the Order of Malta and awarded several honorary doctorates.

==Early years==
Unanue&#x27;s father, Prudencio Unanue Ortiz, was born in Villasana de Mena, in the province of Burgos, in northern Spain. He emigrated to Puerto Rico, where he met a young Spanish girl by the name of Carolina Casal, whose parents also had immigrated to Puerto Rico from Galicia. They were married in the island in 1921 and soon after moved to New York City and settled in Brooklyn where Joseph was born.

Prudencio Unanue worked as a broker for Spanish companies doing business in the U.S. He soon realized that there was a need for Hispanic products in New York City, and in 1936 he founded Goya Foods, a food distributing company, in Manhattan.

Prudencio Unanue was very serious about his children&#x27;s education and enrolled them in Catholic schools. Joseph attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Grammar School and later St. Cecilia&#x27;s High School. Since childhood and when not in school, Unanue and his brothers had to work in the family business. His special job was bottling all over olives. In 1943, he graduated from high school but, since World War II was in full swing, he was drafted into the United States Army.

==World War II==
After basic training, Unanue attended the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. Due to the intensity of the war, he was soon sent to the battlefield. In 1944, his Army company landed in France and soon joined General George S. Patton&#x27;s 3rd Army at the Battle of the Bulge. Unanue was only 19 years old and a Private First Class when his sergeant died in action. He was then named sergeant in the field and made platoon leader. Unanue pulled his men to safety and was awarded the Bronze Star for bravery.

==Goya Foods==
In 1946, after Unanue returned home, he enrolled in The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. He joined the family business, together with his brothers Tony and Frank Unanue. He learned every facet of the food industry. At first, the major supermarkets, such as A&amp;P and Safeway were not interested in selling anything with the Hispanic demography in mind. Eventually, with the wave of Hispanic immigrants landing in the United States, the supermarket industry started to take notice. Goya Foods started to supply Safeway&#x27;s Supermarket in Harlem and the rest soon followed.

Unanue married Carmen Ana Casal (1934–2021), his maternal first cousin, in 1956. Casal was an art collector and philanthropist. They had six children and 16 grandchildren.

In 1976, Unanue was named president of the company, whose principal base of operations was by then in New Jersey. His brother Frank ran Goya de Puerto Rico, Inc., located in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Under Joseph&#x27;s leadership, the company became the largest Hispanic–owned food distributor in the United States, with sales of over $800 million a year and with over 2,000 employees. Goya Foods grew to have more than a dozen facilities in the continental United States, while affiliated companies operate in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Spain.

In 1985, Unanue&#x27;s son Joseph F. Unanue was named Vice President of Operations, a position he held until 1998 when he died of cancer. His younger son, Andy Unanue, was named to replace Joseph F. Unanue.

==Later years==
In February 2004, after 27 years as president of Goya Foods, 78-year-old Joseph and his son Andy were ousted from the company by Joseph&#x27;s two nephews. Joseph resided in Alpine, New Jersey with his wife Carmen Ana and continued to participate in civic and cultural activities.

In 2008, his son Andy was briefly a candidate for the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in New Jersey. He announced his candidacy on March 23, 2008, and filed petitions for the race on April 7, 2008. He dropped out of the race four days later and his committee on vacancies designated former Congressman Dick Zimmer to enter the race under the Unanue petitions.

He died of complications of pulmonary fibrosis in 2013.

==Legacy==
One of Unahue&#x27;s distinctions was a knighthood in the Order of Malta. He was presented with the key to the city of Boston, Massachusetts. In 1991 he was presented with the National Hispanic Achievement Award, and was twice named the &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by the National Conference of Christians and Jews. The National Suppliers Association presented him with the Leadership Award.

Unanue received honorary doctorates from Mercy College and Long Island University in New York, and from Felician College in New Jersey. The Catholic University of America named one of its campus houses &quot;The Joseph Unanue House&quot;.

==Military awards and decorations==
Among Unanue&#x27;s decorations are the following:
*  Bronze Star
*  American Defense Service Medal
*  American Campaign Medal
*  World War II Victory Medal

<doc id="1120028" wikidata="Q2849614" url="?curid=1120028" title="English language in Europe">
<text>The English language in Europe, as a native language, is mainly spoken in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Outside of these states, it has official status in Malta, the Crown Dependencies (the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey), Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (two of the British Overseas Territories). In the Netherlands, English has an official status as a regional language on the isles of Saba and Sint Eustatius (located in the Caribbean). In other parts of Europe, English is spoken mainly by those who have learnt it as a second language, but also, to a lesser extent, natively by some expatriates from some countries in the English-speaking world. 

The English language is the de facto official language of England, the sole official language of Gibraltar and of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, and one of the official languages of Ireland, Malta, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey and the European Union.

The United Kingdom and Ireland form a &quot;European Anglosphere&quot; with an area of about and a population of over 71 million. 

According to a survey published in 2006, 13% of EU citizens then spoke English as their native language. Another 38% of EU citizens then stated that they had sufficient English skills to hold a conversation, so the total reach of English in the EU in 2006 was 51%.

European English is known by a number of colloquial portmanteau words, including: &quot;Eurolish&quot; (first recorded in 1979), &quot;Eurish&quot; (1993) and &quot;Eurlish&quot; (2006).

==History of English==

English is said to be a descendant of the Germanic languages spoken by the Germanic tribes of the German Bight along the southern coast of the North Sea, the Angles, Saxons, Frisians and Jutes. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, around 449 AD, Vortigern, King of the Britons, issued an invitation to the &quot;Angle kin&quot; (Angles, led by Hengist and Horsa), to help him against the Picts. In return, the Angles were granted lands in the South-East. Further aid was sought, and in response &quot;came men of Ald Seaxum of Anglum of Iotum&quot; (Saxons, Angles and Jutes). The Chronicle documents the subsequent influx of settlers who eventually established seven kingdoms: Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Kent, Essex, Sussex and Wessex.

These Germanic invaders dominated the original Celtic-speaking inhabitants. The dialects spoken by these invaders formed what would be called Old English, which was also strongly influenced by another Germanic language, Old East Norse, spoken by Danish Viking invaders who settled mainly in the North-East. English, England and East Anglia are derived from words referring to the Angles: &quot;Englisc&quot;, &quot;Angelcynn&quot; and &quot;Englaland&quot;.

For 300 years following the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Anglo-Norman language (or Anglo-French during the Plantagenet period) was the language of the elite and the administration and few Kings of England spoke English. A large number of French words were absorbed into Old English, which also lost most of its inflections, resulting in Middle English. Around the year 1500, the Great Vowel Shift marked the transformation of Middle English into Modern English.

The most famous surviving work from Old English is &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the most famous Middle English work being Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

The rise of Modern English began around the fifteenth century, with Early Modern English reaching its literary pinnacle at the time of William Shakespeare. Some scholars divide Early Modern English and Late Modern English at around 1800, in concert with the British conquest of much of the rest of the world, as the influence of native languages affected English enormously.

==Classification and related languages==
English belongs to the western sub-branch of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family of languages. The closest undoubted living relatives of English are Scots and the Frisian languages. West Frisian is spoken by approximately half a million people in the Dutch province of Friesland (Fryslân). Saterland Frisian is spoken in nearby areas of Germany. North Frisian is spoken on the North Frisian Islands in the North Sea. While native English speakers are generally able to read Scots, except for some odd unfamiliar words, Frisian is largely unintelligible (though it was much closer to modern English&#x27;s predecessors, Middle English and especially Old English).

After Scots and Frisian, the next closest relative is the modern Low German language of the eastern Netherlands and northern Germany, which was the old homeland of the Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain. Other less closely related living languages include Dutch, German, and the North Germanic languages. Many French words are also intelligible to an English speaker, as English absorbed a tremendous amount of vocabulary from the Norman language after the Norman conquest, and French in later centuries; as a result, a substantial proportion of English vocabulary is very close to French, with some slight spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings, etc.) and some occasional shifts in meaning.

==English in Britain and Ireland==
===Ireland===

The second English dominion was Ireland. With the arrival of the Normans in Ireland in 1169, King Henry II of England gained Irish lands and the fealty of many native Gaelic nobles. By the 14th century, however, English rule was largely limited to the area around Dublin known as the Pale. English influence on the country waned during this period to the point that the English-dominated Parliament was driven to legislate that any Irish of English descent must speak English (requiring those that did not know English to learn it) through the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367.

English rule expanded in the 16th century by the Tudor conquest of Ireland, leading the Gaelic order to collapse at the start of the 17th century. The Flight of the Earls in 1607 paved the way for the Plantation of Ulster and a deepening of the English language culture in Ireland. The Cromwellian Plantation and suppression of Catholicism, including both native Irish and the &quot;Old English&quot; (those of Anglo-Norman descent), further cemented English influence across the country.

As the centuries passed and the social conditions in Ireland deteriorated, culminating in the Great Irish Famine, Irish parents didn&#x27;t speak Irish to their children as they knew that the children might have to emigrate and Irish would be of no use outside the home country, in Britain, the United States, Australia or Canada. In addition, the introduction of universal state education in the national schools from 1831 proved a powerful vector for the transmission of English as a home language, with the greatest retreat of the Irish language occurring in the period between 1850 and 1900.

By the 20th century, Ireland had a centuries-old history of diglossia. English was the prestige language while the Irish language was associated with poverty and disfranchisement. Accordingly, some Irish people who spoke both Irish and English refrained from speaking to their children in Irish, or, in extreme cases, feigned the inability to speak Irish themselves. Despite state support for the Irish language in the Irish Free State (later the Republic of Ireland) after independence, Irish continued to retreat, the economic marginality of many Irish-speaking areas (see Gaeltacht) being a primary factor. For this reason Irish is spoken as a mother tongue by only a very small number of people on the island of Ireland. Irish has been a compulsory subject in schools in the Republic since the 1920s and proficiency in Irish was until the mid-1980s required for all government jobs.

It may be noted, however, that certain Irish words (especially those germane to political and civic life) in the Republic are rarely, if ever, translated into English. These include the names of legislative bodies (such as Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann), government positions such as Taoiseach and Tánaiste, of the elected representative(s) in the Dáil (Teachta Dála), and political parties (such as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael). Ireland&#x27;s police force, the Garda Síochána, are referred to as &quot;the Gardaí&quot;, or &quot;the Guards&quot; for short. Irish appears on government forms, euro-currency, and postage stamps, in traditional music and in media promoting folk culture. Irish placenames are still common for houses, streets, villages, and geographic features, especially the thousands of townlands. But with these important exceptions, and despite the presence of Irish loan words in Hiberno-English, Ireland is today largely an English-speaking country. Fluent or native Irish speakers are a minority in most of the country, with Irish remaining as a vernacular mainly in the relatively small Gaeltacht regions, and most Irish speakers also have fluent English.

===Northern Ireland===

At the time of partition, English had become the first language of the vast majority in Northern Ireland. It had small elderly Irish-speaking populations in the Sperrin Mountains as well as in the northern Glens of Antrim and Rathlin Island. There were also pockets of Irish speakers in the southernmost part of County Armagh. All of these Irish speakers were bilingual and chose to speak English to their children, and thus these areas of Northern Ireland are now entirely English-speaking. However, in the 2000s a Gaeltacht Quarter was established in Belfast to drive inward investment as a response to a notable level of public interest in learning Irish and the expansion of Irish-medium education (predominantly attended by children whose home language is English) since the 1970s. In recent decades, some Nationalists in Northern Ireland have used it as a means of promoting an Irish identity. However, the amount of interest from Unionists remains low, particularly since the 1960s. About 165,000 people in Northern Ireland have some knowledge of Irish. Ability varies; 64,847 people stated they could understand, speak, read and write Irish in the 2011 UK census, the majority of whom have learnt it as a second language. Otherwise, except for place names and folk music, English is effectively the sole language of Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement specifically acknowledges the position both of Irish and of Ulster Scots in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.

===Scotland===

Anglic speakers were actually established in Lothian by the 7th century, but remained confined there, and indeed contracted slightly to the advance of the Gaelic language. However, during the 12th and 13th centuries, Norman landowners and their retainers, were invited to settle by the king. It is probable that many of their retainers spoke a northern form of Middle English, although probably French was more common. Most of the evidence suggests that English spread into Scotland via the burgh, proto-urban institutions which were first established by King David I. Incoming burghers were mainly English (especially from Northumbria, and the Earldom of Huntingdon), Flemish and French. Although the military aristocracy employed French and Gaelic, these small urban communities appear to have been using English as something more than a &quot;lingua franca&quot; by the end of the 13th century. English appeared in Scotland for the first time in literary form in the mid-14th century, when its form unsurprisingly differed little from other northern English dialects. As a consequence of the outcome of the Wars of Independence though, the English of Lothian who lived under the King of Scots had to accept Scottish identity. The growth in prestige of English in the 14th century, and the complementary decline of French in Scotland, made English the prestige language of most of eastern Scotland.

Thus, from the end of the 14th century, and certainly by the end of the 15th century, Scotland began to show a split into two cultural areasthe mainly English or Scots Lowlands, and the mainly Gaelic-speaking Highlands (which then could be thought to include Galloway and Carrick; see Galwegian Gaelic). This caused divisions in the country where the Lowlands remained, historically, more influenced by the English to the south: the Lowlands lay more open to attack by invading armies from the south and absorbed English influence through their proximity to and their trading relations with their southern neighbours.

In 1603 the Scottish King James VI inherited the throne of England, and became James I of England. James moved to London and only returned once to Scotland. By the time of James VI&#x27;s accession to the English throne the old Scottish Court and Parliament spoke Scots. Scots developed from the Anglian spoken in the Northumbrian kingdom of Bernicia, which in the 6th century conquered the Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin and renamed its capital of Din Eidyn to Edinburgh (see the etymology of Edinburgh). Scots continues to heavily influence the spoken English of the Scottish people today. It is much more similar to dialects in the north of England than to &#x27;British&#x27; English, even today. The introduction of King James Version of the Bible into Scottish churches also was a blow to the Scots language, since it used Southern English forms.

In 1707 the Scottish and English Parliaments signed a Treaty of Union. Implementing the treaty involved dissolving both the English and the Scottish Parliaments, and transferring all their powers to a new Parliament in London which then became the British Parliament. A customs and currency union also took place. With this, Scotland&#x27;s position was consolidated within the United Kingdom.

Today, almost all residents of Scotland speak English, although many speak various dialects of Scots which differ markedly from Scottish Standard English. Approximately 2% of the population use Scottish Gaelic as their language of everyday use, primarily in the northern and western regions of the country. Virtually all Scottish Gaelic speakers also speak fluent English.

===Wales===

In 1282 Edward I of England defeated Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Wales&#x27;s last independent prince, in battle. Edward followed the practice used by his Norman predecessors in their subjugation of the English, and constructed a series of great stone castles in order to control Wales, thus preventing further military action against England by the Welsh. With ‘English’ political control at this time came Anglo-Norman customs and language; English did not displace Welsh as the majority language of the Welsh people until the anti-Welsh language campaigns, which began towards the end of the 19th century (54% spoke Welsh in 1891; see Welsh language). The Welsh language is currently spoken by about one-fifth of the population. It has been enjoying support from the authorities for some decades, resulting in a revival, and is in a healthy position in many parts of Wales.

==English in other British or formerly British territories==

===Channel Islands===
The bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are two Crown Dependencies. Besides English, some (very few) inhabitants of these islands speak regional languages, or those related to French (such as Jèrriais, Dgèrnésiais and Sercquiais).

===Cyprus===
In 1914, the Ottoman Empire declared war against the United Kingdom and France as part of the complex series of alliances that led to World War I. The British then annexed Cyprus on 2 November 1914 as part of the British Empire, making the Cypriots British subjects. Most of Cyprus gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, with the UK, Greece and Turkey retaining limited rights to intervene in internal affairs. Parts of the island were excluded from the territory of the new independent republic and remain under UK control. These zones are what are known as the Sovereign Base Areas or SBAs.

The British colonial history of Cyprus has left Cypriots with a good level of English but it is no longer an official language in either the Greek south side of the island, formally known as the Republic of Cyprus or the Turkish north, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus though English remains official in the SBAs. Since the effective partition of the island in 1974, Greek and Turkish Cypriots have had little opportunity or inclination to learn the others&#x27; language, and are more likely to talk to each other in English. Older Turkish Cypriots who worked or lived with Greek Cypriots prior to partition often speak Greek quite fluently. Indeed, many Ottoman soldiers took Greek wives and were allowed to marry up to four.

English is also commonly used in Cyprus to communicate with foreign visitors. The large number of British tourists (and other, largely Northern European ones, who use English as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;) who visit Cyprus regularly has contributed largely to the continued use of English on Cyprus, especially in its thriving tourist industry.

After independence in the 1960s there was some attempt to encourage French, which was still the most important European language. This policy would have been in line with that in place in Greece at the time. Furthermore, in the 1960s, affluent French-speaking tourists (both from France and Lebanon) in terms of percentage were more important than today. Overall though, the French policy was indicative of a desire to distance Cyprus from the former British colonial power, against which a bitter war of independence had recently been fought and won.

However, knowledge of English is helped by the large Cypriot migrant communities in the UK and Australia, leading to diffusion of culture and language back to their country of origin, and negative sentiments towards the UK have waned or disappeared. There is now a large British expatriate population, in addition to the British military presence in the Sovereign Base Areas, as well as the UN buffer zone, whose peacekeepers usually also use English as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;. All of the above maintains an English-speaking presence on the island.

===Gibraltar===
Gibraltar has been a British overseas territory since an Anglo-Dutch force led by Sir George Rooke seized &quot;The Rock&quot; in 1704 and Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to Great Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.

The territory&#x27;s Gibraltarian inhabitants have a rich cultural heritage as a result of the mix of the neighbouring Andalusian population with immigrants from Great Britain, Genoa, Malta, Portugal, Morocco and India.

The vernacular language of the territory is Llanito. It consists of a mix of Andalusian Spanish and British English as well as languages such as Maltese, Portuguese, Genoese and Haketia. Even though Andalusian Spanish is the main constituent of Llanito, it is also heavily influenced by British English, involving a certain amount of code-switching into English.

English remains the sole official language, used by Government. It is also the medium of instruction in schools and most Gibraltarians who go on to tertiary education do so in the UK. Gibraltar receives Spanish television and radio, and British television is also widely available via satellite. Whereas a century ago, most Gibraltarians were monolingual Spanish speakers, the majority is now naturally bilingual in English and Spanish.

===Isle of Man===
The Isle of Man is a Crown Dependency. English and Manx Gaelic are the two official languages.. The last native speaker of Manx, Ned Maddrell, died in 1974.

===Menorca===
Like Gibraltar, Menorca was ceded to Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht, although as it transpired this was to be a temporary dominion. Nevertheless, while under British Control Menorca become the Royal Navy&#x27;s main Mediterranean base and English has been very widely spoken throughout Menorca ever since. Although not an official language, English tends to be used on much public signage for the benefit of tourists and expatriates, alongside Castilian Spanish and Menorcan Catalan.

==Other countries==
There are also pockets of native English speakers to be found throughout Europe, such as in southern Spain, France, Algarve in Portugal, as well as numerous US and British military bases in Germany. There are communities of native English speakers in some European cities outside the UK and Ireland, such as Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo, Paris, Prague, Rome, Stockholm, and Vienna.

In Luxembourg, a trilingual country, there was a proposal in 2019 to make English an official language, but this ultimately failed to get the required minimum number of signatures to be discussed by the parliament. In 2021, a similar proposal was made, which failed to meet the 4500 minimum signatures. 

In 2020, two English-language courts opened in Stuttgart and Mannheim, in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. According to a spokesperson of the Baden-Württemberg Judiciary, all judges of the Stuttgart Commercial Court and the Mannheim Commercial Court will be able to conduct hearings in the English language. The courts have been created with the intent of settling international disputes, thus increasing the role of Germany in international commercial law.

In 2021, Juhana Vartiainen, then mayor of Helsinki, proposed to elevate English as an official language in Finland. He cited the difficulty typically encountered by foreigners in learning Finnish and the aim of making Helsinki more attractive to international talent. 8,000 Helsinkians speak English as their native language, which is 1.2% of Helsinki&#x27;s population and makes it the 7th most spoken native language in the city.

Throughout Europe, tourism, publishing, finance, computers and related industries rely heavily on English due to Anglophone trade ties. Air traffic control and shipping movements are almost all conducted in English.

In areas of Europe where English is not the first language, there are many examples of the mandated primacy of English: for example, many European companies, such as Airbus, Philips, Renault, Volvo, etc. have designated English to be the language of communication for their senior management, and many universities offer their programmes in English. The language is also a required subject in most European countries. Thus, the percentage of English speakers is expected to rise.

Euro English or European English, less commonly known as EU English and EU Speak, is a dialect of English based on the technical jargon of the European Union and the native languages of its non-native English speaking population.

==English as &quot;lingua franca&quot;==

English is the most commonly spoken foreign language in 19 out of 25 European Union countries (excluding Ireland)
In the EU25, working knowledge of English as a foreign language is clearly leading at 38%, followed by German and French (at 14% each), Russian and Spanish (at 6% each), and Italian (3%).
&quot;Very good&quot; knowledge of English is particularly high in Malta (52%), Denmark (44%), Cyprus (42%) and Sweden (40%). 
Working knowledge varies a lot between European countries. It is very high in Malta, Cyprus, Scandinavia and the Netherlands, but low in Russia, Spain (12%), Hungary (14%), Italy (5%) and Slovakia (14%). On average in 2012, 38% of citizens of the European Union (excluding the United Kingdom and Ireland) stated that they have sufficient knowledge of English to have a conversation in this language.

English has become the pre-eminent second language of Europe not in the absence of any colonial history or diaspora, but rather as a concerted effort to increase fluency in English by Europeans since the Second World War. English has become the most useful language to connect different language groups in Europe. The impact of Brexit on EU language policy remains to be seen, but it is possible that the EU, in retaining English as a key working language without the dominant presence of British English speakers, would claim ownership over its own variety of English and develop it for its own needs.

<text>Asterix in Britain (also known as &quot;Asterix in the land of the Britons&quot; - translated from ) is a French comic story, written by Rene Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo. It is the eighth story in the &quot;Asterix&quot; comic book series, and was originally published by Dargaud as a serial for &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine in 1965, before being released as a comic album in 1966.

The story focuses on Asterix and Obelix travelling to Roman-occupied Britain to help deliver a barrel of magic potion to a rebel Briton village, only to encounter obstacles that hinder their journey. The story featured several references and parodies surrounding British culture and society.

&quot;Asterix in Britain&quot; received an audiobook adaptation, as well as two film adaptations: an animated film of the same name in 1986; and a live-action film, &quot;Asterix and Obelix: God Save Britannia&quot;, in 2012.

==Plot summary==
Following a successful military campaign, the Romans conquer most of Britain. However, one village (situated in present-day Kent) manages to resist the invaders. Mykingdomforanos, the village&#x27;s chief, knwoing they will need help, assigns his best warrior, Anticlimax, to seek help from his cousin in Gaul, after he mentions how they rely on a potion of superhuman strength to resist the Romans. Travelling by night, he reaches Armorica, where he reunites with his cousin Asterix and explains the situation to him. Druid Getafix, being informed of his request, agrees to supply a barrel of potion, with Asterix and Obelix offering to help transport it to Britain. Before they leave, Asterix notices Getafix in possession of strange herbs he got from the Far East, and takes some with him.

Travelling across the English Channel, the group encounter a Roman galley, which Obelix delights in boarding having been bored with the Roman&#x27;s absence around their village. Unknown to them, a Roman officer returning to Gaul overhears Obelix unintentionally reveal their mission, and returns to Britain to give warning to newly appointed governor Encyclopaedicus Britannicus. After Asterix and his friends narrowly avoid being captured by a Roman patrol searching for them, they make for the city of Londinium and hide out at a tavern run by Dipsomaniax. Britannicus, learning they were heading for the city, guesses their likely actions and has all barrels of beer and wine confiscated fromm every tavern and inn, leading to the magic potion being seized amongst them. The following day, Asterix, Obelix and Anticlimax head to the governor&#x27;s palace to get the potion back.

Finding the Romans have gotten drunk after being up all night taste testing the barrels, with one having had the potion by accident, they discover they can&#x27;t find their barrel amongst those taken from Dipsomaniax&#x27;s tavern. Although they take these barrels back, Obelix accidentally gets drunk from one of them and distracts the group into fighting a Roman patrol, allowing a thief to steal them. Asterix and Anticlimax attempt to search for the thief with little luck, before finding the Romans had razed Dipsomaniax&#x27;s tavern to the ground in their absence, arresting him and Obelix, per Britannicus&#x27; orders. Learning they were imprisoned in the Tower of Londinium, they attempt to rescue them, though fortunately Obelix, recovering from a hangover, breaks himself and Dipsomaniax from prison, reuniting with Asterix and Anticlimax. Resuming their search, they eventually track down the thief to a suburb of the city.

Learning he sold all the barrels, they find that the barrel of magic potion was eventually sold on to a rugby team, and seize it from them during a rugby match. However, in their escape along the Thames, the Romans ambushes the trio, destroying the barrel and spilling its contents into the river. Although disheartened, Asterix recalls the herbs he took and decides to feign making the potion with them. The resulting brew gives a psychological boost to the rebel Britons, who promptly defeat another Roman assault with ease. Mykingdomforanos, made aware of the truth, asks for more of the herbs after declaring the brew will be their national drink. After bidding farewell to Anticlimax, the Gauls return home. During a banquet held by their village in honor of their latest victory, Asterix inquires about the herbs, to which Getafix reveals them to be called tea.

==Characters==
* Asterix – Gaulish warrior, and the main protagonist of the story.
* Obelix – Gaulish menhir delivery man and warrior, and a close friend of Asterix.
* Dogmatix – Obelix&#x27;s pet dog, who is loyal to him and Asterix.
* Getafix – Gaulish druid of the village, responsible for the superhuman magic potion they use.
* Vitalstatistix – Chief of the Gaulish village.
* Anticlimax – A Briton warrior, and cousin of Asterix.
* Mykingdomforanos – Anticlimax&#x27;s Briton chief. The character&#x27;s appearance is a caricature parody of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In the French original, the character is known as Zebigbos, a parody of the phrase &quot;The big boss&quot;.
* Dipsomaniax – A tavern owner in Londinium.
* Encyclopaedicus Britannicus – The newly elected governor of Britain following the Roman&#x27;s conquest of the island.
* Tullis Stratocumulus – A Roman officer being sent back to Gaul from Britain, and to his camp near Asterix&#x27;s village.
* The Pirates – A group of pirates led by Captain Redbeard, who often suffer bad luck with the Gauls.

Julius Caesar makes a brief cameo in one panel during the opening background of the story. The Beatles make a cameo appearance in one panel as a group of famous Briton bards.

==Cultural references==
As with stories involving encounters with various foreign people, &quot;Asterix in Britain&quot; makes fun of common English stereotypes, though in the original publication both Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo included a foreword stating that this was done with no intention of insulting France&#x27;s &quot;famous rivals&quot;.

The story features several notable references, the most notable being:

* In the story, Asterix and Obelix head for a rugby match, in which one of the teams comes from Camulodunum and wear blue and white uniforms. Camulodunum is the ancient name of Colchester, while the uniforms are based on those wore by the footballers of Colchester United FC. The opposing team they face come from &quot;Durovernum&quot;. The name references a Roman town and hilltop fort called Durovernum Cantiacorum that became the site for present-day Canterbury.
* The name Mykingdomforanos is a pun on the Shakespearean line &quot;my kingdom for a horse&quot; from the play &quot;Richard III&quot;. The name Encyclopaedicus Britannicus is a play on the real-life name of the general knowledge encyclopaedia, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.
* In the French version of the comic, Goscinny and Uderzo used literal French translations of English expressions - for example &quot;Je dis!&quot;, which is the translation of &quot;I say!&quot; In some of their work with English expressions, they stuck with French grammar rather than English, meaning some adjectives were placed before nouns, rather than after them. For the English translation, translators Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge had several Briton characters speak with a stereotypical &quot;upper class&quot; English, such as for example &quot;This is a jolly rum thing, eh, what?&quot;
* The city of Londinium is based on the real-life Roman city that was founded in 47 AD. The comic&#x27;s creators took some historical liberty in using it for some of the settings used in the comic.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Asterix in Britain&quot; received two film adaptations of its story:

* An animated film of the same name was released in 1986 by both Dargaud and Gaumont. The French cast included Roger Carel and Pierre Tornade, whilst the English cast featured Jack Beaber and Bill Kearns; with Graham Bushnell voicing Anticlimax in both the French and English versions. The film followed the plot of the comic, but with some changes:
** Dogmatix accompanies the group on their adventure.
** Julius Caesar&#x27;s role in the story was fleshed out by Goscinny and Uderzo, who also redesigned the character of Stratocumulus and gave him a more prominent role in the film.
** The character Britannicus was replaced by a Roman general named Motus, while the character of Dipsomaniax was replaced with a Gaulish ex-pat called Gaullix.
** A new character called Totalapsus was added to the story as a comic foil, who pursues the group but with little luck.
** The tea herbs Asterix uses are acquired from a Phoenician merchant that Obelix saves from the Pirates.
* A live-action film, &quot;Asterix and Obelix: God Save Britannia&quot;, was released in 2012 by Fidélité Films, and starred Édouard Baer and Gérard Depardieu. The adaptation changed several aspects - including replacing Mykingdomforanos with the historical figure Queen Cordelia (portrayed as a parody of Elizabeth II), and Anticlimax&#x27;s tribe being Scottish in appearance with tartan kilts - whilst also including a number of elements from &quot;Asterix and the Normans&quot;, including the character of Justforkix.

Alongside the film adaptations, an audiobook of the comic was released by EMI Records in 1987, under its &quot;Listen for Pleasure&quot; label. The adaptaions was handled by Anthea Bell, and narrated by Willie Rushton.

<text>Over My Heart is the seventh and final studio album by American singer Laura Branigan. Released in August 1993, it was Branigan&#x27;s most personal album and saw her again try her hand at producing, alongside successful producer Phil Ramone. While the Gloria Estefan-penned &quot;Love Your Girl&quot; was aimed for the clubs that made her famous, the album was ballad-heavy, including the opener &quot;How Can I Help You To Say Goodbye&quot;; the Spanish-language &quot;Mujer Contra Mujer&quot;; &quot;Mangwane (The Wedding Song)&quot; (taught to her by her friend Stevie Godson, who was also the executive producer on the track), sung in Sotho, a South African language, and recorded there with the Mmabana Children&#x27;s Choir; and several of her own compositions, &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Win It All&quot; and &quot;Over You&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; praised the album in their review, writing &quot;acclaimed singer applies her graceful alto to a collection of first-rate originals plus songs written for her by the likes of Gloria Estefan, Michael Bolton, and Roxette&#x27;s Per Gessle. Title track single is geared for AC play with potential pop crossover. The same is true of the touching opener &quot;How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,&quot; Gessle&#x27;s &quot;The Sweet Hello, The Sad Goodbye,&quot; and Branigan&#x27;s own &quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Win It All.&quot;

Chuck Eddy from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Branigan&#x27;s 1982 hit, &#x27;Gloria&#x27;, took disco to operatic extremes, and her &#x27;84 &#x27;Self Control&#x27; was basically Joy Division&#x27;s Goth-punk classic, &#x27;She&#x27;s Lost Control&#x27;, made more lurid. Nowadays, Branigan is beating Celine Dion at Dion&#x27;s own game, dancing between a loudly sung boom and a lonely housewife gloom. On &quot;Over My Heart&quot;, she climbs out on a new limb, belting out lyrics in Spanish and a South African dialect. But she&#x27;s still rending hearts, especially when she remembers the day her family moved away from her best friend in a &#x27;59 station wagon.&quot;

&quot;Allmusic&quot; noted that &quot;at the age of 36, Laura Branigan felt it was time to sing more about heartache and the pains of failing relationships than to give her music the same kind of pop amiability found on past hits like &quot;Self Control&quot; and &quot;Gloria.&quot; But the real problem with &quot;Over My Heart&quot; is that each and every track gets doused with an overabundance of thirty-something insipidness and routine-sounding lyrical drivel...The one thing that Branigan does have going for her is her voice, which sounds fresh and crisp despite her clichéd material.&quot;

==&quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Win It All&quot;==
&quot;Didn&#x27;t We Almost Win It All&quot; was released as the first single from the album. Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as &quot;a sweeping power-ballad&quot; from Branigan&#x27;s &quot;delicious (but sadly underrated) &quot;Over My Heart&quot; album.&quot; He added, &quot;Branigan&#x27;s distinct, crystal-clear voice is warmly familiar, running through a gamut of theatrical emotions as only she can. The arrangement is packed with grandiose piano rushes, nimble guitar riffs, and pounds of faux-strings. Like sinfully tasty candy for the brain.&quot;

<doc id="1120048" wikidata="Q720106" url="?curid=1120048" title="Scroll">
<text>A scroll (from the Old French &quot;escroe&quot; or &quot;escroue&quot;), also known as a roll, is a roll of papyrus, parchment, or paper containing writing.

==Structure==

A scroll is usually partitioned into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges. Scrolls may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of writing material. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled and stowed to the left and right of the visible page. Text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction (boustrophedon).

==History==

Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean ancient Egyptian civilizations. Parchment scrolls were used by the Israelites among others before the codex or bound book with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD. Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times.

The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off scrolls.

==Rolls==

Shorter pieces of parchment or paper are called &quot;rolls&quot; or &quot;rotuli&quot;, although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use &quot;roll&quot; instead of &quot;scroll&quot;. Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for manuscript administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60 cm or two feet wide. Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.

A special Chinese form of short book, called the &quot;whirlwind book&quot;, consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.

==Scotland==
In Scotland, the term &quot;scrow&quot; was used from about the 13th to the 17th centuries for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (&quot;Rotulorum Clericus&quot;) meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.

==Replacement by the codex==
The codex form of the book—that is, folding a scroll into pages, which made reading and handling the document much easier—appears during the Roman period. Stemming from a passage in Suetonius&#x27; &quot;Divus Julius&quot; (56.6), legend has it that Julius Caesar was the first to fold scrolls, concertina-fashion, for dispatches to his forces campaigning in Gaul. But the precise meaning of the passage is by no means clear. As C. H. Roberts and T. C. Skeat point out, the idea that &quot;Julius Caesar may have been the inventor of the codex... is indeed a fascinating proposition; but in view of the uncertainties surrounding the passage, it is doubtful whether any such conclusion can be drawn&quot;. What the evidence of surviving early codices does make clear is that Christians were among the earliest to make widespread use of the codex. Several Christian papyrus codices known to us date from the second century, including at least one generally accepted as being no later than A.D. 150. &quot;All in all, it is impossible to believe that the Christian adoption of the codex can have taken place any later than circa A.D. 100 (it may, of course, have been earlier)&quot;. There were certainly practical reasons for the change. Scrolls were awkward to read if a reader wished to consult material at opposite ends of the document. Further, scrolls were written only on one side, while both sides of the codex page were used.

Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or &quot;leaves&quot;, and bound together along one edge. The bound pages were protected by stiff covers, usually of wood enclosed with leather. is Latin for a &quot;block of wood&quot;: the Latin , the root of &quot;library&quot;, and the German , the source of &quot;book&quot;, both refer to wood. The codex was not only easier to handle than the scroll, but it also fit conveniently on library shelves. The spine generally held the book&#x27;s title, facing out, affording easier organization of the collection. The surface on which the ink was applied was kept flat, not subjected to weakening by the repeated bending and unbending that scrolls undergo as they are alternately rolled up for storage and unrolled for reading, which creates physical stresses in both the papyrus and the ink of scrolls.

The term &quot;codex&quot; technically refers only to manuscript books — those that, at one time, were handwritten. More specifically, a codex is the term used primarily for a bound manuscript from Roman times up through the Middle Ages.

From the fourth century on, the codex became the standard format for books, and scrolls were no longer generally used. After the contents of a parchment scroll were copied in codex format, the scroll was seldom preserved. The majority that did survive were found by archaeologists in burial pits and in the buried trash of forgotten communities.

==Modern technology ==
Modern technology may be able to assist in reading ancient scrolls. In January 2015, computer software may be making progress in reading 2,000-year-old Herculaneum scrolls, computer scientists report. After working for more than 10 years on unlocking the contents of damaged Herculaneum scrolls, researchers may be able to progress towards reading the scrolls, which cannot be physically opened.

==In popular culture==
* Many role-playing games (such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;) feature scrolls as magical items, which cast spells when they are read aloud. Typically, the scroll is consumed in the process.

<text>Thomas Hardy (3 March 1752 – 11 October 1832) was a British shoemaker who was an early Radical, and the founder, first Secretary, and Treasurer of the London Corresponding Society.

==Early life==
Thomas Hardy was born on 3 March 1752 in Larbert, Stirlingshire, Scotland, the son of a merchant seaman. His father died in 1760 at sea while Thomas was still a boy. He was sent to school by his maternal grandfather and later apprenticed to a shoemaker in Stirlingshire. He later worked in the Carron Iron Works. As a young man, arrived in London just before the American Revolutionary War. On 21 May 1781 he was married at St-Martin-in-the-Fields church to Lydia Priest, the youngest daughter of a carpenter and builder from Chesham, Buckinghamshire. The couple had six children, all of whom died in infancy. Lydia died in childbirth on 27 August 1794, her child (the sixth) being stillborn: the cause may have been the injuries she had sustained when a loyalist &quot;Church and King&quot; mob attacked the Hardy home some weeks earlier. In 1791, Hardy opened his own boot and shoe shop at 9 Piccadilly, London.

==Involvement with the London Corresponding Society==
Around 1792, Hardy founded the London Corresponding Society, starting out with just nine friends. However, they were soon joined by others, including Olaudah Equiano. Two years later, on 12 May 1794, it had grown so powerful that he was arrested by the King&#x27;s Messenger, two Bow Street Runners, the private secretary to Home Secretary Dundas, and others on Crown charges of high treason. It was during his imprisonment that Hardy&#x27;s wife died, leaving him with an unfinished letter declaring her love for him. The charges were prosecuted with Sir John Scott leading for the Crown, and William Garrow among the prosecuting counsel; while Hardy was defended by Thomas Erskine. He was acquitted after nine days of testimony and debate, on Guy Fawkes Day, 1794.

==Death and legacy==
In later life Hardy ceased involvement in politics, and with the assistance of friends set up a small shoe shop in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. In September 1797 he moved to a smaller establishment in Fleet Street. He died on 11 October 1832 at his home in Queen&#x27;s Row, Pimlico, London. He was buried at Bunhill Fields burial ground, where a granite obelisk, designed by John Woody Papworth, was later erected in his memory.

<text>Richard Lippold (May 3, 1915 – August 22, 2002) was an American sculptor, known for his geometric constructions using wire as a medium.

==Life==
Lippold was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He studied at the University of Chicago, and graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in industrial design in 1937.
Lippold worked as an industrial designer from 1937 to 1941. After he became a sculptor, Lippold taught at several universities, including Hunter College at the City University of New York, from 1952 to 1967.

When describing Lippold&#x27;s floor-to-ceiling sculpture &quot;Trinity&quot;, the American artist Howard Newman said:
Lippold was an engineering genius, but we&#x27;ve been dealing with a piece that had reached the threshold of catastrophe...People&#x27;s mouths fall open when they see it going back up, like they&#x27;re watching a spider spin a web of blazing gold...The more that goes up, the more exquisite it gets.

The 14th and 15th of John Cage&#x27;s famous &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; for prepared piano are subtitled &quot;Gemini – after the work of Richard Lippold&quot;.

<text>Green Wing is a British sitcom set in the fictional East Hampton Hospital. It was created by the same team behind the sketch show &quot;Smack the Pony&quot; – Channel 4 commissioner Caroline Leddy and producer Victoria Pile – and stars Mark Heap, Tamsin Greig, Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt. It focuses on soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters, portrayed in sketch-like scenes and sequences in which the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasising the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.

The series ran between 3 September 2004 and 19 May 2006. One episode, filmed with the second series, was shown as a 90-minute-long special on 4 January 2007 in the UK, but was shown earlier in Australia and Belgium on 29 December 2006. Separate from the series, a sketch was made for Comic Relief and screened on 11 March 2005. Another was performed live at The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball on 14 October 2006. On 29 April 2024, &quot;Green Wing&quot; returned as a six-part audio series released by Audible entitled &quot;Green Wing: Resuscitated&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Green Wing&quot;&#x27;s plot revolves around the lives of the staff of the East Hampton Hospital Trust, a fictional National Health Service (NHS) hospital with staff ranging from the slightly unusual to the completely surreal.

The series begins with a new arrival, surgical registrar Caroline Todd (Tamsin Greig). Caroline works alongside two other doctors: Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan), an arrogant, half-Swiss, womanising anaesthetist, and &quot;Mac&quot; Macartney (Julian Rhind-Tutt), a suave, fashionable surgeon. Caroline soon develops feelings for both of them, though she is unsure as to which of the two she truly loves. Throughout the series, it becomes clear that Mac is her true love, but a range of misadventures prevent their relationship from flourishing. Other people Caroline meets include Martin Dear (Karl Theobald), a friendly house officer who is constantly failing his exams. He is unloved by his mother and is often bullied by Guy. Martin soon develops feelings for Caroline. There is also Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), a seemingly perfect, but irritating, senior registrar in pediatrics. Caroline dislikes Angela, but ends up taking her in as a lodger.

Caroline&#x27;s main rival for Mac&#x27;s affections is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the staff liaison officer employed to listen and respond to the problems of East Hampton&#x27;s staff. Sue is hostile and contemptuous towards everyone except Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness.

Alan Statham (Mark Heap) is an overbearing, stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist. He is in a relationship with Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood), the 48-year-old head of human resources, although she despises him. Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris) often hinting at it when goading Alan. Joanna&#x27;s staff include Kim Alabaster (Sally Bretton); Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons); Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage; and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who is often bullied by Kim and Rachel.

== Creation ==

=== Writers and crew ===

&quot;Green Wing&quot; was devised, created and produced by Victoria Pile. She was also the casting director, one of the writers, and part of the editing, filming and post-production teams. She described &quot;Green Wing&quot; as &quot;a sketch-meets-comedy-drama-meets-soap&quot;, and a continuation of her previous show, &quot;Smack the Pony&quot;, where &quot;Green Wing&quot;&#x27;s crew also worked. Unusually for a British sitcom, which typically has only one or two writers, the show had eight: Pile, her husband Robert Harley, Gary Howe, Stuart Kenworthy, Oriane Messina, Richard Preddy, Fay Rusling and James Henry.

Pile and her co-writers initially used battery packs to represent characters, moving them around on her desk to develop scenarios for the show. The decision to make the characters doctors came later. Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.

The show was directed and edited (along with Pile) by Tristram Shapeero and Dominic Brigstocke. Sketches were sped up or slowed down to create comic effect, often using body language to create humour. Editing was also used due to the amount of corpsing that occurred during the filming of the show. Tamsin Greig was said to corpse frequently, and episodes were written to minimise the contact between the characters of Caroline Todd and Alan Statham because Greig found it difficult not to laugh when acting alongside Mark Heap. The music, which features prominently in the show, was written by Jonathan Whitehead (under the name &quot;Trellis&quot;) and won him an RTS Craft &amp; Design Award.

=== Production ===

Following her success with &quot;Smack the Pony&quot;, Channel 4 gave Pile a fairly free hand with her next project. Their only requirement was that it should have enough of a narrative thread to make it more of a sitcom than a sketch show.
The show had a half-hour pilot made in 2002 that was never aired. Scenes from the pilot were used in the first episode, &quot;Caroline&#x27;s First Day&quot;, and can be spotted due to the characters&#x27; appearance, most notably Rhind-Tutt&#x27;s haircut. The pilot allowed the writers to experiment, such as using different filming techniques. In the pilot, Doon Mackichan played Joanna Clore and was meant to play her in the original series, but left when she became pregnant.

Although each script was fully written, the actors were allowed to improvise their own jokes, frequently adding to what had already been written. Workshops were often used to allow actors to improvise their own material. One example of improvised material was Stephen Mangan&#x27;s idea of Guy falling in love with Caroline. The show&#x27;s crew also make appearances in the show as extras. For example, Pile&#x27;s former assistant Phil Secretan (after whom Guy is named) appears at the end of a scene in the first episode. Henry appears in the background during Martin&#x27;s exam in the episode, &quot;Tests&quot;.

The filming was done at two hospitals, the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. This presented a problem because the show had to work around the real-life hospitals, with their actual doctors, patients and emergency situations. In one scene in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting squash balls behind him, and nearly hit a patient. However, some scenes, such as those in Sue&#x27;s and Alan&#x27;s offices, were filmed in a studio. The pub in series two is filmed at the Foundation Beefeater in Fulwell, South West London.

&quot;Green Wing&quot;&#x27;s title is said to have come from a small plastic green man with wings that was in executive producer Peter Fincham&#x27;s top pocket, and fell on Pile&#x27;s desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it. This plastic man appears at the end of the credits on every show.

=== Unused storylines ===

Some plot lines written for &quot;Green Wing&quot; were never used. Unused storylines included Alan having an 80-year-old wife and step-grandchildren as old as him, and Guy suffering from impotence. Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital, not just doctors, but porters, car park attendants and kitchen staff. However, she decided that they had enough material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers.

Two endings were created for the special. The alternative ending is included on the DVD release of &quot;Green Wing&quot;, along with deleted scenes from the episode. The alternative ending was planned to be used if a third series was going to be commissioned, as this ending was much more ambiguous. &quot;Green Wing&quot;&#x27;s cast preferred the alternative ending, but after some debate, it was not shown.

== Series summaries ==

=== Series 1 ===
The thirteen main characters appear in all nine episodes of the first series. Amongst the recurring guest characters, Lyndon, Oliver (Ken Charles), Lady Emily &quot;Emmy&quot; Lewis Westbrook (Daisy Haggard), Liam (Oliver Milburn), Cordelia Denby (Saskia Wickham), and Charles Robertson (Harley) all appear. However, Charles is credited as &quot;Chief Executive&quot; in the episode that he appears. Guest actors who appear in this series include John Oliver, Stephen Merchant, Kevin Eldon and Rosie Cavaliero. Other than Harley, other &quot;Green Wing&quot; writers make cameos. These include Fay Rusling, Gary Howe, Oriane Messina and Henry James.

=== Comic Relief sketch (2005) ===

Mac fends off Sue&#x27;s advances by saying he will only allow her to touch his arse if she can raise £10,000 for Comic Relief. Sue asks Martin, Joanna, Guy, and Alan for the money, which she eventually manages to raise, but Mac runs off before she can get hold of him.

=== Series 2 ===
Most of the regular cast appear in all episodes. The only exception is the character of Dr. Angela Hunter (played by Sarah Alexander), who appears in the first three episodes and then leaves the hospital. Among the recurring guest characters are Dr. Holly Hawkes, Lyndon Jones (played by Paterson Joseph), Oliver (Ken Charles), The Neurosurgeon (Pip Torrens), Jake Leaf (Darren Boyd) and Charles Robertson (Harley). However, the character of Charles is credited as &quot;CEO&quot; in the episodes in which he appears. Guest actors who appear in this series include Nick Frost, Peter McDonald, Big Mick and Rosie Cavaliero. Apart from Harley, other &quot;Green Wing&quot; writers make cameo performances in the show, including Fay Rusling and Oriane Messina.

=== Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball sketch (2006) ===

A sketch was performed for Amnesty International&#x27;s Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball, with performances from Tamsin Greig, Stephen Mangan, Julian Rhind-Tutt and Michelle Gomez. Mangan and Rhind-Tutt appeared in two sketches.

When the announcer at the ball asks if there is a doctor in the house, Mac puts his hand up, to Caroline&#x27;s embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy&#x27;s fiancée. An unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that the patient is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the patient is stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that the patient is transgender.

=== Special ===


The episode begins with the funeral of Angela, who departed the show during the second series, and was later killed by a moose. Mac, after a month&#x27;s leave, discovers what has happened between Caroline and Guy, and although hurt, makes no attempt to interfere. Guy, on learning of Mac&#x27;s terminal illness, tells Caroline to marry Mac instead of him.

Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna are still on the run, having abandoned Martin. Whilst on their journey, they accidentally kill three more people, a mechanic, a shop assistant and a policeman. Soon, they decide that, with no transport, money or employment, the only option is suicide. They are last seen, naked, walking hand-in-hand towards the sea. Meanwhile, Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident and has developed better dress sense. Boyce ends up missing Alan, after finding that his replacement will not tolerate any misbehaviour. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot. They form their own tribe and become hostile to anyone who enters the department.

Mac and Caroline finally marry, despite Mac&#x27;s terminal illness (the exact nature of which is never disclosed, although Mac does tell Guy that its name has an &quot;a&quot; and an &quot;e&quot; in it). Sue gets over her obsession with Mac and finds love with a new man, who reciprocates her feelings. The episode concludes with Caroline being carried into the air by a mass of helium filled balloons at the wedding reception. The DVD box set extras include an alternative ending where Guy and Mac grab onto Caroline&#x27;s ankles and are taken to the sky with her; this alternative ending concludes with Mac saying, &quot;Caroline, there&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been meaning to tell you.&quot;

=== Green Wing: Resuscitated ===
The revival is set 12 years after the original series ended. Caroline is now a medical pioneer in the USA, Guy has become a TV personality, and Mac has returned from several near-death experiences to continue working as a surgeon. Boyce has been promoted to head of radiology and Harriet is now head of human resources. Following their murder spree Joanna is now in prison, while Statham&#x27;s lawyers got him a reduced sentence involving psychiatric care, and he is now working under Boyce. Sue is still working as the staff liaison officer and Martin has still not qualified as a doctor.

== Critical reaction ==

The show received generally very positive reviews. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; said that it was &quot;a comedy as physically adroit as it was verbally sharp,&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that &quot;Channel 4’s hospital sitcom is the most innovative comedy since, well, &quot;The Office&quot;.&quot; Criticisms of &quot;Green Wing&quot; include the lazzi methods of filming and the overall length of the episodes, with some critics claiming that hour-long episodes are too long. The show won the 2005 and 2006 Comedy Tumbleweed Awards for &quot;Worst Camerawork.&quot; Similar comments were made by A. A. Gill. When the first series was broadcast, he praised the cast and characters, but commented negatively on the filming style and dramatic qualities. He also said:
&quot;...it was one of the most freshly funny and crisply innovative comedies for years. The humour was all based in the character, not the situation. The story lines were negligible; there were no catch phrases; it was surreal in a way we hadn’t seen since &quot;Monty Python&quot;; and the cast were actors being funny from inside a characterisation, not stand-up comics bolting a cartoon persona onto the back of gags.&quot;

The rest of the series received some praise and, in a 2009 article, Gill–– writing about the current comedy output at the time–– said: &quot;Show me a funny indigenous comedy series; show me one that has been made in the past five years, other than &quot;Green Wing&quot;.&quot;

The first series is the most popular amongst &quot;Green Wing&quot; fans. According to one poll conducted in 2006 (before the final special episode was broadcast), the fifth episode of the series, &quot;Housewarming Party&quot;, was voted the best &quot;Green Wing&quot; episode of all. The second most popular was the eighth episode of series one, &quot;Slave Auction&quot;. &quot;Housewarming Party&quot; was also watched at the &quot;Wingin&#x27; It &quot;Green Wing&quot; convention&quot;, being voted the favourite episode in, &quot;A landslide victory&quot;.

Critics considered the second series worse than series one. In particular, the first episode of the series was seen as poor. Cathy Pryor in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; wrote of the episode:

&quot;Sadly, though, since I&#x27;m something of a fan, I have to report that the first episode of the second series is, disappointingly, rather flat. To be fair, there were a couple of laugh-out-loud moments—Dr Statham banging his head and falling down being one of them—but the whole didn&#x27;t quite gel. Or should that be coagulate? I&#x27;ll stop making bad jokes now since I&#x27;m still not as funny as anyone in the show. But I sincerely hope that the opener is a one-off and not a sign that &quot;Green Wing&quot; is going down the pan.&quot;

Gill was also highly critical of the episode in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;:

&quot;Within two minutes, &quot;Green Wing&quot; had destroyed itself, lost its assured grip on the cliff of comedy and tumbled into the abyss of embarrassing overacting, formless gurning and pointless repetition. What had once looked Dada-ishly brilliant now looked like stoned improv from a show-off&#x27;s drama school. The lack of plot and coherent narrative that previously had been a blessed freedom was revealed to be a formless free-for-all, brilliant performances as silly mannerisms. Nothing I&#x27;ve seen this year has disappointed me as sharply as the second series of &quot;Green Wing&quot;.&quot;

Chris Riley for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; gave a more mixed review of the series, writing that it was &quot;so far proving oddly impenetrable—particularly given how, first time around, it consistently demonstrated what a firm grasp it had on when to cut loose, and when to deliver more conventional laughs. But there&#x27;s still enough delirious madness going on to ensure that diehard fans won&#x27;t be giving up hope just yet.&quot;

&quot;The Observer&quot; was more positive, with Kathryn Flett voting &quot;Green Wing&quot; as one of the top ten television programmes of 2006. &quot;Broadcast&quot; voted &quot;Green Wing&quot; the joint-second best comedy series in 2006, alongside the sketch show &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot;, which also stars some &quot;Green Wing&quot; actors such as Olivia Colman (Harriet Schulenburg) and Paterson Joseph. They described the series as &quot;fresh, subversive, and surreal.&quot; In South Africa, where &quot;Green Wing&quot; was broadcast on BBC Prime, &quot;The Sunday Times of South Africa&quot; voted the show the best DStv programme of 2007. Composer Daniel Pemberton wrote that the soundtrack to &quot;Green Wing&quot; was &quot;one of the most innovative TV soundtracks in recent years.&quot;

Although the second series was heavily advertised, the first episode of the series was watched by 1.8 million people (8% of the audience). The first episode of the first series, &quot;Caroline&#x27;s First Day&quot;, attracted 2.2 million (11%) in comparison. The second episode attracted the same ratings as the previous episode, while the last episode was watched by 2 million viewers (11% of the audience). The second series was also nominated for two Royal Television Society awards; for &quot;Best Production Design—Entertainment &amp; Non Drama Productions&quot; and &quot;Best Tape &amp; Film Editing—Entertainment &amp; Situation Comedy&quot;, but failed to win.

== Media ==

=== DVDs ===
=== Books ===
The first series scripts were released as &quot;Green Wing: The Complete First Series Scripts&quot; in paperback on 22 October 2006 () by Titan Books. The book contains bonus material made exclusively for the book and previously unseen photos.

=== Soundtrack ===
The soundtrack, entitled &quot;Green Wing: Original Television Soundtrack&quot;, was released by &quot;Silva Screen&quot; on 8 October 2007. It contains 23 tracks of the best of Jonathan Whitehead&#x27;s Original Music created for the show.

== Awards and nominations ==
&quot;Green Wing&quot; won the first BAFTA Pioneer Audience Award in 2005. This is the only BAFTA award that is voted on by the general public. Pippa Haywood won the 2005 Rose d&#x27;Or for &quot;Best Female Comedy Performance&quot;. Tamsin Greig won an award at the RTS Awards in 2005 for &quot;Best Comedy Performance&quot;. Jonathan Whitehead won &quot;Best Original Score&quot; at the RTS Craft &amp; Design Awards 2005. Greig received a BAFTA nomination for Best Comedy Performance in 2005, losing to David Walliams and Matt Lucas.

&quot;Green Wing&quot; also won a number of &quot;The Comedy.co.uk Awards&quot;, including the &quot;Comedy of the Year&quot; award in 2006.

== Possible spin-off ==
A third series of &quot;Green Wing&quot; was not made, due to scheduling difficulties with the cast and crew undertaking new projects, and a lack of budget at production company talkbackTHAMES. However, creator Victoria Pile mentioned in a 2007 interview in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; that she may create a spin-off, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m hoping to do another Channel 4 comedy imminently, possibly starring some of the same cast. Hopefully, it will be some kind of spin-off from &quot;Green Wing&quot;.&quot;

In 2009, Pile and most of the writing team behind &quot;Green Wing&quot; created a sitcom pilot set at a university, entitled &quot;Campus&quot;, which featured similar concepts to &quot;Green Wing&quot;, including improvisation. The motto of the university was &quot;with wings,&quot; a reference to the show. The pilot was broadcast as part of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Comedy Showcase&quot;. A full series began in 2011, but was cancelled after one series.

== Impact ==
A cocktail called the Green Wing was served at the 2005 BAFTAs. It was made using vodka, cloudy apple juice, elderflower cordial, and sparkling mineral water. A &quot;Green Wing&quot; convention called &quot;Wingin&#x27; It&quot; was organised to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and took place on 13 January 2007 at the Brook Green Hotel, Hammersmith. There was a special appearance by &quot;Green Wing&quot; cast at the British Film Institute, on 17 January 2007; Pile, Greig, Mangan, and Rhind-Tutt appeared. Some of the other writers, as well as Theobald and Heap, were in the audience. The event was hosted by John Lloyd. &quot;Green Wing&quot; appeared in an episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Imagine&quot;, entitled &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Studio&quot;. Some of the funeral scenes from the special were shown, and the presenter of the show, Alan Yentob, appeared as one of the mourners.

<text>Charleston is a neighborhood, or section, of New York City&#x27;s borough of Staten Island. It is located on the island&#x27;s South Shore, with Tottenville to the south, Pleasant Plains to the East, Rossville to the north, and the Arthur Kill to the west. The neighborhood is represented in the New York City Council by Joe Borelli and in the New York State Senate by Andrew Lanza.

== History ==

Charleston, once a small village settled by the Androvette farming family in 1699, bore their name as Androvetteville or Androvettetown through the 18th century. In approximately 1850, eight of the twenty-nine structures in the village belonged to the Androvette family.

Some longtime locals remember Charleston as Kreischerville. With the arrival of Balthasar Kreischer (1813–1886), a Bavarian immigrant and founder of the Kreischer Brick Manufactory, the area became known as &quot;Kreischerville&quot; as his business success supported the surrounding area. Balthasar Kreischer had three mansions built on Kreischer Hill, one of which still stands and is designated a historical landmark. This surviving Kreischer House, at 4500 Arthur Kill Road at the intersection of Kreischer Street, was renovated by the Staten Island Land Development LLC. The mansion has a certificate of occupancy for a 70-seat restaurant that will operate at night. The factory, built in 1854, was destroyed by fire in 1877 and rebuilt. The factory finally shut its doors in 1927.

The name Charleston seems to have arisen during World War I, when anti-German sentiment flourished as the United States entered the war. &quot;Charleston&quot; appears to have been chosen so as to name the village after Charles Kreischer, one of Balthasar Kreischer&#x27;s sons.

Charleston once had its own United States Post Office branch, and mail sent there bore the postal code &quot;Staten Island 13, New York&quot;. The post office, located at 28 Androvette Street, was closed in 1949. While neighborhoods on Staten Island do not have universally agreed-upon boundaries, most observers today reckon Charleston as consisting of a triangle-shaped territory enclosed by Bloomingdale Road, the Richmond Parkway, and the Arthur Kill; this gives Charleston a slightly larger area than that which the former post office served. By the current wider definition, Charleston includes portions of Sandy Ground, settled in 1828 by African Americans who had achieved freedom from slavery, most of whom came to the area from Maryland. Remnants of the original settlement still exist.

== Development ==
Charleston is one of the most remote and sparsely populated areas within all of New York City. In addition to the Kreischer mansion and Sandy Ground, the neighborhood is also home to the Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve and the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, a closed state prison property. Even today many Charleston residents still keep horses on their property.

Recent development in the area has spawned a new shopping corridor along Veterans Road West, including Staten Island&#x27;s first Target and third Home Depot, among many other stores located in Bricktown Centre at Charleston, an open-air lifestyle center. A second shopping center is located along Veterans Road West. Development in that part of Charleston has continued.

The Tides at Charleston, an adult community development of approximately 120 units, broke ground in Summer 2007, with units available for occupancy as of early 2008. A Kresicherville Active Adult community is slated to cost $25 million and will preserve the Kreischer mansion as a central landmark for the development.

In June 2016, a Shoprite opened on Veterans Road. It is the only supermarket located in Charleston as of 2020.

In September 2017, developers announced the construction of Riverside Galleria, a shopping mall in the southern part of Charleston designed by Studio V Architecture. The mall would include amenities such as a waterfront park, elevated walkways, and green roofs, as well as a variety of shops that included restaurants, a &quot;dine-in cinema&quot;, and a supermarket. However, plans for the mall were canceled in January 2019 due to community opposition.

On March 17, 2022, the New York Public Library opened its first net-zero energy library in New York City, located in the Bricktown Commons shopping center on the South Shore. Designed by Ikon 5 Architects, nearly 100 percent of the building&#x27;s energy will be derived from solar panels. The Charleston Library features &quot;dedicated spaces for adults, teens, and children and flexible multi-purpose rooms for programs and classes.&quot;

==Transportation==
MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27; Charleston Depot, off Arthur Kill Road, opened in January 2011. Charleston is served by the local buses along Arthur Kill Road, all of which terminate at Bricktown Mall. Charleston is also served by the local bus on Bloomingdale Road. The SIM26, an express bus to Manhattan, also runs along Bloomingdale Road. New York State Route 440 and Korean War Veterans Parkway pass through Charleston.

== Cityscape==
In 2002, Allen Alishahi, a broker at Sun Properties of New York Inc., estimated that one third of Charleston was residential, one third had commercial and industrial properties, and one third was parkland. The majority of houses were single-family homes, including ranch houses, Victorian houses, detached Colonial houses, and French mansard houses. A significant number of houses in Charleston date from the early 1900s. Newer homes tend to be semi-detached houses grouped in enclaves, or large custom detached houses.

==Demographics==
Charleston residents included many Germans in the 19th century, many Hungarian immigrants in the 20th century, and more recently many families of Irish and Italian origin.

== Crime ==

Despite having a very low crime rate along with the rest of the South Shore, Charleston was nonetheless home to two notable crime-related figures, one a perpetrator and the other a victim. Serial killer Richard Biegenwald, who murdered at least six people during 1958–1983, was born and raised there. In 1990, the neighborhood attracted more media attention when an anti-gay hate crime was committed there: James Zappalorti, a 45-year-old disabled veteran of the Vietnam War, was stabbed to death by two assailants, one of whom also resided in Charleston at the time. The Zappalorti murder sparked New York State to adopt enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by bias.

==Education==
The New York City Department of Education serves Charleston. As of 2002, the majority of Charleston elementary-school students attend P.S. 56; others attend P.S. 6 or P.S. 62. For grades six through eight, the majority attend Totten Intermediate School (I.S. 34) or Paulo Intermediate School (I.S. 75). Tottenville High School is the area high school.

The sole school facility within Charleston itself is an annex to P.S./I.S. 25R South Richmond High School, a [[special education] school with its main campus in [[Pleasant Plains, Staten Island|Pleasant Plains]]. The annex was previously P.S. 4, a stand-alone school.

<text>In multi-agent system research, distributed knowledge is all the knowledge that a community of agents possesses and might apply in solving a problem. Distributed knowledge is approximately what &quot;a wise man knows&quot;, or what someone who has complete knowledge of what each member of the community knows knows. Distributed knowledge might also be called the aggregate knowledge of a community, as it represents all the knowledge that a community might bring to bear to solve a problem. Other related phrasings include cumulative knowledge, collective knowledge or pooled knowledge. Distributed knowledge is the union of all the knowledge of individuals in a community of agents.

Distributed knowledge differs from the concept of Wisdom of the crowd, in that the latter is concerned with opinions, not knowledge.
Wisdom of the crowd is the emergent opinion arising from multiple actors. It is not the union of all the knowledge of these actors, it does not necessarily include the contribution of all the actors, it does not refer to all the knowledge of these actors, and typically broadly includes opinions and guesswork.
Wisdom of the crowd is a concept useful in the context of social sciences, rather than in the more formal multi-agent systems or Knowledge-based systems research.

== Example ==
The logicians Alice and Bob are sitting in their dark office wondering whether or not it is raining outside. Now, none of them actually knows, but Alice knows something about her friend Carol, namely that Carol wears her red coat only if it is raining. Bob does not know this, but he just saw Carol, and noticed that she was wearing her red coat. Even though none of them knows whether or not it is raining, it is &quot;distributed knowledge&quot; amongst them that it is raining. If either one of them tells the other what they know, it will be clear to the other that it is raining.

If we denote by formula_1 that Carol wears a red coat and with formula_2 that if Carol wears a red coat, it is raining, we have

: formula_3

Directly translated: Bob knows that Carol wears a red coat and Alice knows that if Carol wears a red coat it is raining so together they know that it is raining.

Distributed knowledge is related to the concept Wisdom of the crowd. Distributed knowledge reflects the fact that &quot;no one of us is smarter than all of us.&quot;

<doc id="1120086" wikidata="Q786815" url="?curid=1120086" title="Turbo-folk">
<text>Turbo-folk is a subgenre of contemporary South Slavic pop music that initially developed in Serbia during the 1990s as a fusion of techno and folk. The term was an invention of the Montenegrin singer Rambo Amadeus, who jokingly described the aggressive, satirical style of music as &quot;turbo folk&quot;. While primarily associated with Serbia, this style is also popular in other former Yugoslav republics.

==Croatia==
Turbo-folk grew in Croatia in part due to the popularity of the Croatian singer Severina&#x27;s fusion of turbo-folk in her music. Turbo-folk is purportedly seen as a &quot;part of everyday life in Croatia and serves a means of social release and reaction to the effects of globalisation in Croatia&quot; according to contemporary art professor Urosh Cvoro of UNSW Sydney.

Upon introduction of &quot;Billboard&quot; Croatia Songs chart on 15 February 2022, it became apparent that mainstream music from Serbia and other former Yugoslav republics (which is all described as turbo-folk or by a derogatory term &quot;&quot; (plural: &quot;cajke&quot;) by its critics in Croatia) dominated the music taste of the people of Croatia, as the only Croatian artists featured on the chart were Eni Jurišić, Matija Cvek, 30zona, Kuku$ Klan, Jelena Rozga and Grše, and the only Western artists featured on the chart were Glass Animals and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

== Central Europe ==
Turbo-folk can be heard in Balkan clubs and Ex-Yu-style discos in parts of Switzerland that speak German. Reports of turbo-folk from 2023 describe the music used for diasporic youth in these areas to &quot;socialise and live out the culture of their country of origin&quot; according to Dr Müller-Suleymanova of ZHAW.

==Criticism==

Critics of turbo-folk alleged that it was a promotional instrument of Serbia&#x27;s political ideology during  Milošević rule. This liberal section of Serbian and Croatian society explicitly viewed this music as vulgar, almost pornographic kitsch, glorifying crime, moral corruption and nationalist xenophobia. In addition to making a connection between turbofolk and &quot;war profiteering, crime &amp; weapons cult, rule of force and violence&quot;, in her book &quot;Smrtonosni sjaj&quot; (Deadly Splendor) Belgrade media theorist Ivana Kronja refers to its look as &quot;aggressive, sadistic and pornographically eroticised iconography&quot;. Along the same lines, British culture theorist Alexei Monroe calls the phenomenon &quot;porno-nationalism&quot;. However, turbo-folk was equally popular amongst the South Slavic peoples during the Yugoslav Wars.

The resilience of a turbo-folk culture and musical genre, often referred to as the &quot;soundtrack to Serbia’s wars&quot;, was and to a certain extent still is, actively promoted and exploited by pro-government commercial TV stations, most notably on Pink and Palma TV-channels, which devote significant amount of their broadcasting schedule to turbo-folk shows and music videos.

Others, however, feel that this neglects the specific social and political context that brought about turbo-folk, which was, they say, entirely different from the context of contemporary western popular culture. In their opinion, turbo-folk served as a dominant paradigm of the &quot;militant nationalist&quot; regime of Slobodan Milošević, &quot;fully controlled by regime media managers&quot;. John Fiske feels that during that period, turbo-folk and its close counterpart, Serbian Eurodance, had the monopoly over the officially permitted popular culture, while, according to him, in contrast, Western mass media culture of the time provided a variety of music genre, youth styles, and consequently ideological positions.
