<text>&quot;Here There Be Tygers&quot; is a short story by American writer Ray Bradbury, originally published in the anthology &quot;New Tales of Space and Time&quot; in 1951. It was later collected in Bradbury&#x27;s short story collections &quot;R is for Rocket&quot; and &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
A rocket expedition is sent to a planet to see whether or not its natural resources can be harvested for the human race. They discover a paradise which seems to provide for them whatever they desire even as they think of it. They ultimately decide to leave the planet and report that it is hostile and of no benefit to humans.

==Adaptations==
A teleplay of this story was written by Bradbury for possible use on the television program &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, but Rod Serling and the producers of the show deemed it too expensive to film. This led to the end of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s brief association with the show, which resulted in just one of his stories (&quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;) being used. It was later produced as a radio episode of the series &quot;Bradbury 13&quot; (June 18, 1984) and the television program &quot;Ray Bradbury Theater&quot; (November 30, 1990).

A Soviet animated adaptation of the story (in Russian:&quot;Здесь могут водиться тигры&quot;, &quot;Zdes mogut voditsya tigry&quot;, ) was produced in 1989, with the plot change that one of the men wishes to harvest the resources and leave, to the point where he sets an anti-matter bomb to blow the planet up. The planet promptly summons an eponymous tiger to kill him, whilst the captain takes the bomb on board their spaceship and takes off, although not until after one of the men sneaks off to live on the planet. The navigator tells the captain of this, saying it is not too late to turn back and get him, but the captain reveals the bomb, stating that it is too late, and to plot a course as far away as possible. The story ends with the planet giving the remaining astronaut a new pet dog, as well as the promise of a female companion. The movie was directed by Vladimir Samsonov .

==Similar stories in popular culture==
The basic concept is also reminiscent of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1948 short story &quot;Mars Is Heaven!&quot;. 

The Danish-American science fiction film &quot;Journey to the Seventh Planet&quot; (1962) involves astronauts exploring a planet where their memories and desires materialize before them. This turns out to be an elaborate illusion created by a powerful alien entity living in a cavern.

In the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Shore Leave&quot;, a crew finds a planet where any of their desires once thought are acted out in real life. This is due to an alien life-form&#x27;s superior technology, as the planet is actually an alien amusement park. The crew eventually comes to relax on the planet before continuing on their journey. This episode aired in 1966, fifteen years after Ray Bradbury&#x27;s story was first published.

<doc id="1140095" wikidata="Q69243" url="?curid=1140095" title="1968 Formula One season">
<text>The 1968 Formula One season was the 22nd season of the FIA&#x27;s Formula One motor racing. It featured the 19th World Championship of Drivers, the 11th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and three non-championship races open to Formula One cars. The World Championship was contested over twelve races between 1 January and 3 November 1968.

Great Britain driver Graham Hill, driving a Lotus-Ford Cosworth, won his second Drivers&#x27; Championship, six years after his first. Lotus were awarded the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup for the third time. Repco produced a more powerful version of their V8 to help Brabham&#x27;s compete against Ford&#x27;s new Cosworth DFV, but it proved very unreliable: Jochen Rindt qualified on pole position twice but also only finished twice. Hill&#x27;s main rivals were Jackie Stewart at Tyrrell Matra and champion Denny Hulme at McLaren.

The 1968 season turned out to be a turning point in terms of safety, with four Grand Prix drivers being involved in fatal crashes: two-time World Champion Jim Clark, Mike Spence, Jo Schlesser and Ludovico Scarfiotti. It was the last year where all the races were run on tracks with almost no safety modifications.

On the topic of technology, the 1968 headlines were dominated by the wings introduced by Lotus&#x27;s owner Colin Chapman. He installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. Brabham and Ferrari went one better at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix with full-width wings mounted on struts high above the driver. Lotus replied with a full width wing directly connected to the rear suspension that required a re-design of the wishbones and transmission shafts. Matra then produced a high mounted front wing connected to the front suspension. This last innovation was mostly used during practice as it required a lot of effort from the driver. By the end of the season most teams were using sophisticated wings.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1968 FIA World Championship.

===Team and driver changes===
* After receiving offers from every team bar two, Jochen Rindt signed with champions Brabham.
* Reigning drivers&#x27; champion Denny Hulme moved to Bruce McLaren&#x27;s team. (The two worked together in Can-Am and would dominate the series from 1967 to 1971.) After Lotus lost its exclusive right to use Cosworth DFV engines, McLaren also started using Cosworth instead of BRM.
* Scuderia Ferrari ran Chris Amon as their only full-time driver in 1967, but attracted Jacky Ickx for this year.
* Ken Tyrrell entered F1 with Matra International, a joint-venture between Tyrrell Racing and car manufacturer Matra. They signed 1967 runner-up Jackie Stewart. Matra kept running their factory team as well, powered by their own V12s. BRM signed Pedro Rodríguez to replace Stewart.
* With Rindt, Ickx and Rodríguez gone, Cooper needed a complete new driver line-up, which they found in Formula Two driver Brian Redman and long-time Ferrari employee Ludovico Scarfiotti. The team switched from Maserati engines to take over McLaren&#x27;s contract with BRM.

====Mid-season changes====

* Jim Clark was killed in a racing accident during the 1968 Deutschland Trophäe Formula Two race. A devastated Colin Chapman drew in F2 driver Jackie Oliver to fill the seat.
* Chapman lost his Indianapolis 500 driver Mike Spence when he crashed during practice for the 1968 event. In F1, Spence had been driving for BRM, who signed Richard Attwood to replace him. Later in the year, Bobby Unser, winner of that year&#x27;s Indy 500, took the seat.
* Both of Cooper&#x27;s drivers were involved in serious crashes: Redman exited the Belgian Grand Prix with a broken arm, while Scarfiotti would suffer a fatal crash at a hillclimbing race in Germany. The team then hired Lucien Bianchi and Vic Elford.
* Jo Schlesser was signed by Honda to drive the experimental air-cooled RA302, which works driver John Surtees had refused. In just his debut race, the French Grand Prix, local hero Schlesser crashed on the second lap. The fully-fueled car exploded instantly.
* Both Matra teams expanded to two cars near the end of the year. The French team promoted F2 driver Henri Pescarolo and the British team went for F3 driver Johnny Servoz-Gavin.
* Dan Gurney, founder and driver from Anglo American Racers, switched from his own Eagle chassis to a customer McLaren chassis, powered by a Cosworth DFV.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Spanish Grand Prix returned after a fourteen-year absence, hosted at Jarama near Madrid on 12 May.
* The Belgian and Dutch Grand Prix switched places, with F1 visiting Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps first this year.
* The French Grand Prix returned to Rouen-Les-Essarts after four years, replacing the Bugatti version of the Circuit de la Sarthe.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.
* The Canadian Grand Prix was moved from Mosport Park to the new Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Quebec. The two tracks started an agreement to alternately host the GP., The race was moved to September, behind the Italian Grand Prix.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical and safety regulations===
Dan Gurney became the first driver to wear a full-face helmet at the 1968 German Grand Prix. He had helped to invent it with the Bell Helmets company and had already used it at the 1968 Indianapolis 500. Within some years, it became the obvious choice among drivers and was later deemed mandatory.

All cars had to be fitted with a rollbar that stretched out to at least above the driver&#x27;s helmet, an electrical circuit breaker, an oil catch tank and a reverse gear. And the cockpit had to allow easy evacuation.

===Other===
The FIA decided to permit unrestricted sponsorship on cars after the withdrawal of support from automobile related firms like BP, Shell and Firestone. Team Gunston, a South African privateer team, was the first Formula One team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors when they entered a private Brabham for John Love, painted in the colours of Gunston cigarettes, in the 1968 South African Grand Prix. In the next round at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix, Team Lotus, initially using the British racing green, became the first works team to follow this example, with Graham Hill&#x27;s Lotus 49B entered in the red, gold and white colours of the Imperial Tobacco&#x27;s Gold Leaf brand.

==Championship report==

===Early season===

====Round 1: South Africa====
The fast and flowing Kyalami circuit between Johannesburg and Pretoria played host to the South African Grand Prix for the second time on New Year&#x27;s Day 1968. Briton Jim Clark was fastest by a second with his Lotus-Ford/Cosworth teammate Graham Hill alongside him with Jackie Stewart in the new Matra-Ford/Cosworth completing the front row. On the second row there were the two Brabham-Repcos of Austrian Jochen Rindt and Australian Jack Brabham while the third row featured Briton John Surtees in the Honda and the Ferraris of Italian Andrea de Adamich (in a third car) and New Zealander Chris Amon. The race began with Stewart taking the lead from Clark while Hill dropped back to seventh behind Rindt, Surtees, Brabham and Amon. On the second lap, Clark took the lead while Brabham overtook Surtees and Hill passed both Amon and Surtees to run fifth. Further back there was drama when Italian Ludovico Scarfiotti&#x27;s Cooper-Maserati suffered a water leak and the driver was scalded by the escaping hot water. He was taken to hospital with first degree burns. On the seventh lap, Brabham overtook Rindt for third place but soon afterwards he ran into engine trouble and dropped back, leaving Rindt third again. He came under threat from Hill and on lap 13 the Englishman moved to third place. Amon moved into fifth place having overtaken Surtees on the same lap. The order remained stable as Hill chased and caught Stewart and on lap 27 he moved ahead. Stewart stayed with him until Lap 43 of 80 when the Matra retired with a connecting rod failure. This moved Rindt to third once again and the order then remained unchanged all the way to the finish with Lotus scoring a dominant 1–2 finish with Rindt third. Clark won his 25th and last championship Grand Prix from teammate Graham Hill and Austrian Jochen Rindt in a Brabham. Clark broke Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s 10 1/2 year record of 24 Grand Prix victories, and would go on to hold this record until his countryman and friend Jackie Stewart broke the record in 1973.

====Gap between Rounds 1 and 2====
Many F1 drivers in the 1960s went to compete in the Tasman series in New Zealand and Australia during the European winter and the Southern Hemisphere summer, which was a nine-week, eight-race series that started in early January and ended in late February/early March, with respective races every week in open wheel racing cars that were very similar to F1 cars of the time, with exactly the same chassis- only these variants had 2.5 litre engines, as opposed to Formula One world championship cars, which had 3 litre engines.

The non-championship Race of Champions at the English Brands Hatch circuit near London in March was won by Bruce McLaren in his own McLaren car, ahead of Mexican Pedro Rodriguez in a BRM and McLaren&#x27;s teammate and countryman Denny Hulme.

The BRDC International Trophy race at the Silverstone circuit in England was another non-championship race held 5 weeks after the Race of Champions. The race was won by Hulme in a McLaren, ahead of fellow New Zealanders McLaren and Chris Amon in a Ferrari.

On 7 April, Jim Clark, one of the most successful and popular drivers of all time, was killed at Hockenheim in West Germany at a non-championship Formula Two event. The Scotsman had gone off the track caused by what was believed to be a deflating rear tire; 90% of the Hockenheim circuit was made up of two long, slightly curving straights running through thick forests. And because there was no protection from the solid trees lining the circuit on both sides, Clark&#x27;s Lotus smashed into a wall of trees, breaking the Scotsman&#x27;s neck and killing him instantly; the car was totally destroyed.

===European Summer===

====Round 2: Spain====
There was a four-month gap between the South African Grand Prix in January and the Spanish Grand Prix in May. Formula One had lost yet another driver: Briton Mike Spence died four days after a practice accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway while running one of Andy Granatelli&#x27;s Lotus turbines when he hit the wall at Turn One and one of the wheels came back into his cockpit and hit him on the head. The first Spanish Grand Prix since 1954 was held at the brand-new, ultra-modern Jarama circuit just north of the Spanish capital city of Madrid, having held a non-championship race in 1967, which Jim Clark won. Jackie Stewart had to miss this race due to a wrist injury; Amon took pole. In the race, Rodriguez took the lead from Frenchman Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Amon and Hulme. The top three remained unchanged in the early laps but on lap 12 Beltoise took the lead in his Matra-Ford. As he did so the Frenchman&#x27;s car began smoking and on lap 16 he dropped out, leaving Amon (who had overtaken Rodriguez) in the lead. For the next 30 laps, the New Zealander was ahead while Rodriguez shadowed him until he lost control on lap 28 and crashed. This put Hill into second place with Hulme third and Surtees fourth. On lap 58, Amon&#x27;s fuel pump failed and so Hill took the lead and went on to win from Hulme and his promising countryman Brian Redman in a Cooper-BRM.

====Race 3: Monaco====
It was only a year since Lorenzo Bandini had been killed at Monaco, so the chicane was tightened and the race was shortened by 20 laps. Ferrari did not attend amid reports that the team was not happy with the safety standards at the circuit. Team Lotus was there, however, and Graham Hill and Jackie Oliver ran in the new red and gold livery of Gold Leaf and the cars featured the first hints of aerodynamic front and rear wings. BRM had been planning to run Briton Chris Irwin as Mike Spence&#x27;s replacement but in practice for the Nürburgring sportscar race the previous weekend Irwin had flipped an Alan Mann Ford F3L sportscar at the Flugplatz section and had suffered serious head injuries, Irwin never raced again. So, Reg Parnell Racing&#x27;s Richard Attwood was promoted to the works team. Jackie Stewart was still out of action with a wrist injury from the Jarama F2 race a month earlier and so his place in the Matra International team was taken by F1 debutant Johnny Servoz-Gavin. Jean-Pierre Beltoise appeared with the new Matra V12 engine in the back of his Matra Sports entry. Brian Redman was busy racing for the Gulf John Wyer team at the Spa 1000 km sportscar race and his place with Cooper was taken by Belgian Lucien Bianchi. Denny Hulme was also being kept busy as he jetted backwards and forwards to Indianapolis qualifying. Qualifying at Monaco resulted in pole position by 0.6 seconds for Hill with an impressive Frenchman Johnny Servoz-Gavin alongside him on the front row. The second row featured Jo Siffert (in Rob Walker&#x27;s Lotus) and John Surtees in the Honda with Brabham&#x27;s Jochen Rindt and Attwood on the third row. Then came Bruce McLaren and Beltoise, Pedro Rodriguez (BRM) and Hulme. At the start Servoz-Gavin took the lead but after three laps he suffered a driveshaft failure and crashed. This left Hill in the lead and there he stayed for the rest of the afternoon. The first few laps saw a number of accident with Oliver and McLaren colliding on the first lap, Jochen Rindt (Brabham) crashing on lap nine while trying to pass Surtees. Brabham, Dan Gurney and Siffert all went out with mechanical trouble while Beltoise broke his suspension running over a curb and Piers Courage (Reg Parnell Racing BRM) stopped because his car was handling so badly. Surtees then disappeared with a gearbox failure and on the same lap Rodriguez crashed and so only five cars were left by the end of lap 16. As a result, the excitement was limited although third placed Hulme stopped in the mid-race to have a driveshaft replaced and dropped to fifth, leaving Bianchi to finish third behind Hill and Attwood with Lodovico Scarfiotti fourth in the second Cooper-BRM.

====Race 4: Belgium====
Formula One arrived at the fastest circuit of the year: the notoriously dangerous and challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium. Amon took pole at an average speed of more than around this unprotected rural road circuit, an incredible average speed by even today&#x27;s standards. The appearance of wings on the Lotus at Monaco did not go unnoticed and for this race, various teams arrived with experimental wings on their cars. Ferrari was back in action having missed Monaco and entered two cars for Chris Amon and Jacky Ickx. Jackie Stewart was back in action for Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s Matra International team and Lucien Bianchi stayed with the Cooper-BRM team, replacing Lodovico Scarfiotti, as the Italian was committed to racing in the European Hillclimb Championship event at Rossfeld in southern Germany in a Porsche 908. American Dan Gurney and Kiwi Denny Hulme had flown back from Indianapolis having finished second and fourth in the race. Amon was fastest in practice on Friday with Stewart and Ickx alongside him on the front row. Then came John Surtees in the Honda and Hulme with Bruce McLaren, Piers Courage (Reg Parnell Racing BRM) and Pedro Rodriguez (BRM) sharing the third row. Both Lotus drivers had trouble and were on the penultimate row of the grid. Saturday was completely ruined by rain and by the news from Rossfeld that Scarfiotti had been killed. The Italian Scarfiotti was the third Grand Prix driver to die in 2 months, this was turning into the bloodiest year in the history of Grand Prix racing since its origins in the 1900s. Race day was dull and overcast and at the start Amon took the lead with Ickx, Surtees and Hulme chasing him. By the end of the second lap Surtees had taken the lead. There were a rash of retirements early on with Hill, Richard Attwood (BRM), Brabham and Rindt all going out with mechanical trouble. On the seventh lap, Briton Brian Redman (Cooper-BRM) went out when his suspension failed near Les Combes and he crashed violently into a concrete barrier, then went over the barrier and into a parked Ford Cortina road car. The Cooper caught fire but Redman escaped with a badly broken right arm and a few minor burns- he did not race for most of that year. Soon afterwards Amon went out with a radiator problem and then the leader Surtees disappeared when his suspension failed. This left Hulme in the lead but he was quickly overtaken by Stewart and the two diced until Hulme slowed with a driveshaft problem. This left Stewart half a minute clear of McLaren but on the penultimate lap the Matra-Ford driver ran out of petrol and dropped behind McLaren, Rodriguez and Ickx. This was the McLaren team&#x27;s first ever F1 victory, and Bruce McLaren&#x27;s first championship Grand Prix victory since the 1962 Monaco Grand Prix. Bruce also became only the third driver to win a race in a car manufactured by his own team – Jack Brabham having done it in 1966 and Dan Gurney in 1967 at Spa-Francorchamps.

====Race 5: The Netherlands====
The traditional home for the Dutch Grand Prix was the fast beach-side Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam. The Brabham team had its new Repco V8 engine ready and was running a third car for Dan Gurney who had no Weslake engines available for his Eagle. Cooper ran only one car for Lucien Bianchi following the death of Scarfiotti and Brian Redman&#x27;s accident at Spa a fortnight earlier. In qualifying Chris Amon was fastest in his Ferrari with Jochen Rindt&#x27;s Brabham and Graham Hill&#x27;s Lotus sharing the front row. Jack Brabham was on the second row with Jackie Stewart, while the third row featured Belgian Jacky Ickx in a Ferrari, Hulme, and McLaren. The weather was bad all weekend and it was raining lightly at the start. Rindt took the lead but he was in third place by the end of the first lap, behind Hill and Stewart. The rain intensified and on lap four Stewart moved into the lead. He quickly built up a big lead while Hill came under pressure from Beltoise who had moved quickly through the midfield. On lap 23, Beltoise went off and had to pit to clear his throttle of sand and so he dropped back to seventh. When he re-joined he quickly moved up the field, passing Gurney, Ickx, Amon and Rodriguez to get to third place. On lap 50, he overtook Hill for second place. On lap 61, Hill had a spin and dropped to fourth behind Rodriguez. On lap 82, he did it again but this time had to retire. Stewart won his first Grand Prix for more than two years from Beltoise to give Matra chassis a 1–2 result with Rodriguez third for BRM. Ickx was fourth for Ferrari while the Swiss Silvio Moser survived to finish fifth in his private Brabham, although he was three laps behind the winner.

====Race 6: France====
After races at Clermont-Ferrand, Reims and the short Le Mans circuit in 1965, 1966 and 1967 respectively, the French GP returned to the spectacular and dangerous 4-mile (6.4-km) Rouen-Les-Essarts rural road circuit in a forested and hilly area of northern France. This circuit was very fast, narrow and was littered with high-speed sweepers, including a section of fast, anti-banked downhill curves; and two brick-surfaced hairpins at the ends of the track. An all-French team in the form of an Alpine-Renault Grand Prix car was expected to make its debut at its home race, but never materialised, due to its engine lacking 100 brake horsepower compared to the opposition, leading to Renault killing the project. The entry was little changed from the field which had raced in the wet at Zandvoort two weeks earlier with the one exception being the new Honda RA302 car with an air-cooled V8 engine- this new Honda was an experimental research and development car. This had been tested by John Surtees who declined to race it, as he felt it was not suitable for racing. The company founder, Soichiro Honda, was visiting France to try to boost European sales and so it was decided that the car should be entered by Honda France for the popular 40-year-old French racer Jo Schlesser, who had competed in two previous GPs in F2 Matras. Cooper fielded Briton Vic Elford and Matra&#x27;s Johnny Servoz-Gavin to replace the late Ludovico Scarfiotti and the injured Brian Redman while Dan Gurney was missing because of a lack of engines for his Eagle. Qualifying saw Jackie Oliver walk away from a accident which heavily damaged his Lotus. The car could not be repaired in time and so Oliver was forced to miss the rest of the meeting. Jochen Rindt set the fastest time in qualifying in his Brabham with Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Matra-Ford and Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari sharing the front row of the grid. Hulme and Amon shared the second row while Bruce McLaren (McLaren), Surtees (Honda) and Jean-Pierre Beltoise (Matra) made up row three. Championship leader Graham Hill was ninth. Light rain was falling when the race began but most of the drivers decided to start on intermediate tires. The exception was Ickx who chose full wets. As a result, the Belgian was in the lead at the end of the first lap. Stewart and Rindt were battling over second place with Surtees fourth. On the third lap at the notorious Six-Frere&#x27;s corner, which was one of the anti-banked sweepers after the start Schlesser lost control of the R&amp;D Honda and crashed. The car went up the embankment there, overturned and caught fire. The full fuel tank and magnesium chassis burned so intensely that nothing could be done to save Schlesser. The fire burned all over the track, and the drivers were forced to take evasive action at such a high speed part of the circuit. He became the fourth F1 driver to die that season (after Jim Clark, Mike Spence and Lodovico Scarfiotti). But the race went on anyway. Rindt suffered a puncture from wreckage at the scene of the crash and had to pit, dropping to the back of the field. Surtees has moved ahead of Stewart and so ran second until he was overtaken by Rodriguez on lap seven. Further back, Hill overtook Stewart for fourth place but then retired with a driveshaft failure. Ickx went off on lap 19 and dropped behind Rodriguez and Surtees but he caught and repassed both men within two laps and stayed ahead for the rest of the afternoon to score his first ever victory, in only his ninth Grand Prix. Rodriguez had to pit with gearbox problems and he dropped away, leaving Surtees second (although the Honda driver also stopped to replace broken goggles). Third place went to Stewart with Cooper-BRM driver Vic Elford fourth on his Grand Prix debut.

====Race 7: Britain====
The dreadful 1968 season continued on as Graham Hill arrived at Brands Hatch with a big lead in the World Championship and with seven other British drivers in the 20-car field, there was plenty for the fans to cheer. The only major change from the miserable French GP (where Honda driver Jo Schlesser had been killed) was the arrival in the Cooper-BRM team of Robin Widdows. The cars had sprouted increasingly dramatic rear wings in an effort to get as much downforce as possible. Qualifying showed that Team Lotus was dominant with Hill fastest by half a second and Jackie Oliver alongside him. Chris Amon completed the front row in his Ferrari. On the second row, Jo Siffert (Rob Walker Lotus) lined up alongside Jochen Rindt&#x27;s Brabham while the third row featured Dan Gurney (back in action after missing several races in his Eagle-Weslake because of engine problems), Jackie Stewart in Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s Matra-Ford and Jack Brabham&#x27;s Brabham. There was light rain at the start (for the third consecutive race) and Oliver took the lead from Hill and Siffert. The leading Lotus was trailing smoke and on the fourth lap Oliver was overtaken by Hill. Despite the smoke trail, Oliver remained second. However, on the 27th lap, Hill went out with a rear suspension failure and so Oliver went back into the lead. Behind him, Siffert fought for second place with Amon but gradually the Lotus driver moved away. On lap 44, Oliver came to a halt with a transmission failure and so Siffert inherited the lead and went on to win his first ever Grand Prix and Rob Walker&#x27;s first victory in seven years. The Ferraris of Amon and Ickx came home second and third.

====Race 8: Germany====
After Jo Siffert&#x27;s unexpected victory for Rob Walker at Brands Hatch, the F1 teams headed off to the most challenging circuit of the year: the Nürburgring and more bad weather, the previous four races having all been affected by rain. The field was much as normal with the only major additions being German Kurt Ahrens, driving a third Brabham and German Hubert Hahne entered in a BMW-entered Lola-BMW Formula 2 car, the Munich manufacturer having a look at the state of competitiveness in F1. It rained throughout practice and Jacky Ickx took pole position in his Ferrari by a full 10 seconds with Chris Amon (Ferrari) second and Jochen Rindt third in his Brabham. Graham Hill was on the second row in his Lotus, alongside the Cooper-BRM of Vic Elford. The third row featured Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Matra-Ford, John Surtees in the Honda and Piers Courage in a Reg Parnell Racing BRM. At the start of the race–in pouring rain—Hill took the lead from Amon, Rindt and Stewart. In the course of the first lap however, Stewart moved to the front and built a nine-second lead, using his Dunlop wet tires to maximum effect. By the end of the second lap, his lead was out to 34 seconds and after 14 laps he was over four minutes ahead of second-placed Graham Hill, who spun at one point but was able to get out of the car, push it back into the right direction and get it restarted before Rindt arrived, third-placed Amon having spun off earlier on the same lap. Hill managed to keep Rindt behind him third, while fourth place fell to Ickx. Stewart later referred to this race as his greatest Grand Prix victory.

The Gold Cup non-championship race at the Oulton Park circuit near Manchester, England attracted some of the big names and victory went to Jackie Stewart in his Matra-Ford.

====Race 9: Italy====
There was a five-week gap in the World Championship calendar between the German and Italian Grands Prix and after a season of rainfall and tragedy the F1 circus was able to take a break. The entry at the Monza Autodrome near Milan was the biggest of the season with American driver Mario Andretti entered in a third Lotus and his USAC rival Bobby Unser replacing Richard Attwood in the BRM team. Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s Matra International has expanded to run two cars the second being driven by Johnny Servoz-Gavin. Ferrari ran a third car for rising British star Derek Bell while Honda fielded a second RA301 for David Hobbs. Cooper had been planning to run three cars but Robin Widdows was out of action after an accident and so the team ran only Vic Elford and Lucien Bianchi. Early qualifying saw Andretti and Unser setting fast times as both wanted to fly back to the United States to participate in the Indiana State Fairgrounds Hoosier Hundred the following day. They then intended to fly back across the Atlantic and race in the Grand Prix. The organisers announced that if the two drivers did fly back to the United States and race in the Hoosier Hundred, there they would be banned from competing in the Italian race under a rule which forbade drivers to compete in another event within 24 hours of the start of the Grand Prix. They flew off back to Indiana for the dirt race and did not return. Qualifying resulted in John Surtees taking pole his Honda with Bruce McLaren (McLaren) and Chris Amon (Ferrari) alongside him. The second row was shared by Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari and Graham Hill&#x27;s Lotus while Jackie Stewart shared the third row with Denny Hulme (McLaren) and Bell&#x27;s Ferrari. For the first time in months, the race took place in sunny conditions with Surtees taking the lead at the start. McLaren was ahead by the time the cars returned at the end of the first lap. McLaren stayed ahead until lap seven when Surtees slipstreamed into the lead. The following lap McLaren was ahead again while Amon crashed and Surtees also hit the wall trying to avoid the Ferrari. This put Siffert into second place with Stewart third. Stewart then moved to second and a slipstreaming battle developed for the lead between McLaren, Stewart, Siffert and Hulme. Hill disappeared when a wheel fell off his Lotus. McLaren dropped out when he had to pit for more oil on lap 35. Stewart was the next to disappear with engine failure on lap 43 and when Siffert went out with a rear suspension failure of lap 59, Hulme was left to win. There had been a lively battle behind the leaders between Servoz-Gavin, Ickx and Rindt. Ickx had emerged ahead but in the closing laps had to stop for more fuel and so dropped to third behind Servoz-Gavin, Rindt having gone out with an engine failure.

===North American Trilogy===

====Race 10: Canada====
After the successful Canadian GP at Mosport Park near Toronto the previous year, the event was given a more reasonable date in the 1968 calendar, but the race was moved to the exciting Mont Tremblant circuit at St Jovite, in Quebec, one and a half hours northwest of Montreal. With the final three races being held in North America, traveling was also reduced. Attention now centred on the battle for the World Championship with Graham Hill still ahead after his early season successes with 30 points by Jacky Ickx with 27, Jackie Stewart with 26 and Denny Hulme with 24. Lotus ran a third car for Canadian star Bill Brack, while Dan Gurney ran in a third McLaren (having given up with his Eagle-Weslake program). An old Eagle appeared in the hands of local driver Al Pease while BRM ran only one car for Pedro Rodriguez. Matra Sports expanded to a two-car operation Jean-Pierre Beltoise being joined by Henri Pescarolo and with Jackie Stewart running alongside Johnny Servoz-Gavin in the Matra International entries, there were four Matras in the field. In qualifying Ickx&#x27;s hopes of the World title ended when he crashed after his throttle stuck open. He suffered a broken leg. Jochen Rindt took pole position for Brabham—the new Repco engine finally beginning to work—with Chris Amon&#x27;s Ferrari and Jo Siffert&#x27;s Rob Walker Lotus alongside on the front row. Gurney did well to qualify on the second row alongside Hill, while the third row featured Hulme (McLaren), John Surtees (Honda) and Bruce McLaren (McLaren). At the start Amon took the lead with Siffert chasing him. Then came Rindt, Gurney and Hill. The order at the front remained stable with Surtees dropping out early from eighth place. On lap 14, Hill managed to pass Gurney and 12 laps later Gurney dropped away with a broken radiator. On lap 29 of 90, Siffert disappeared with an oil leak and so Rindt was second but he retired soon afterwards with an engine failure which promoted Hill to second place. That too was short-lived as Hill soon dropped behind Hulme and McLaren because of a serious vibration problem. Hill gradually fell back and was overtaken by Rodriguez and Servoz-Gavin. A few laps later the Frenchman spun out and so Hill moved back to fourth. Amon seemed to have everything under control until the 73rd lap when his Ferrari&#x27;s transmission failed. This gave McLaren a 1–2 victory with Rodriguez grabbing third for BRM. The result put Hulme and Hill equal in points in the World Championship with two races to go.

====Race 11: United States====
There were some additions to the usual F1 field at the small Watkins Glen circuit in up-state New York with Team Lotus running a third car for Mario Andretti (who had practiced but not raced for the team in Italy) and Bobby Unser who has suffered a similar fate at Monza in the second BRM. McLaren again ran a third car for Dan Gurney while Ferrari replaced Ickx (who had broken his leg in practice for the Canadian GP) with Derek Bell. Things did not begin well for Unser who did serious damage to his BRM in the first session. On Saturday however, Mario Andretti gave everyone a surprise when he put his Lotus on pole position, ahead of Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Matra. On the second row was Graham Hill in his Lotus and Chris Amon&#x27;s Ferrari while World Championship hopeful Denny Hulme (who was equal on points with Hill after his win in Canada a fortnight earlier) was on the third row alongside Jochen Rindt&#x27;s Brabham. Jack Oliver suffered a wheel failure and crashed the second Lotus heavily. Henri Pescarolo was also a nonstarter when his Matra V12 blew up. A big crowd gathered in the hope that Andretti would be able to beat the F1 regulars and at the start Mario edged into the lead although Stewart overtook him before the end of the first lap. Amon was able to get into third ahead of Hill while Hulme moved quickly up to fifth place. The order remained stable for the first few laps and then Amon spun and dropped back. On lap 14 of 108, Andretti&#x27;s Lotus was dragging part of the bodywork and he was forced to pit and dropped to the tail of the field. He began to fight back but eventually retired with clutch failure. More significantly, however, Hulme spun on oil and had to pit to have a damaged brake pipe fixed. He eventually re-joined, aiming to pick up points but suffered a driveshaft failure in the closing laps and crashed. This left Stewart and Hill untroubled at the front and Gurney running third. He dropped behind Surtees after a spin but recovered to retake the position. In the final minutes of the race, Gurney had a puncture and so Surtees took third place after all. The result was a boost to Graham Hill who moved six point clear of Hulme in the World Championship race although Stewart&#x27;s win put him only three points behind Hill. So it would be a three-way fight for the title in Mexico a month later.

====Race 12: Mexico====
The final round of the championship in Mexico was moved back 2 weeks because of the 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics having taken place only 3 weeks previously. When the F1 teams finally arrived at the high-altitude Magadelena Mixhuca Park circuit in Mexico City for the final round of the World Championship four weeks after Watkins Glen, Graham Hill had 39 points, Jackie Stewart had 36 and Denny Hulme had 33. All the contenders were overshadowed in qualifying by the Swiss Jo Siffert in Rob Walker&#x27;s Lotus 49 who took pole position with Chris Amon&#x27;s Ferrari second. Hill and Hulme shared the second row while Dan Gurney (in the third McLaren) was alongside John Surtees&#x27;s Honda on the third row. Stewart was on row four with Jack Brabham&#x27;s Brabham. For the occasion, the third Lotus was driven by Moises Solana, who out-qualified Lotus driver Jack Oliver after the Essex driver had a spin. At the start of the race neither man on the front well got away well and it was Hill who took the lead although he was overtaken at the first corner by the fast-starting Surtees. Hill re-took the lead later in the lap and was clear by the end of the lap. Stewart had moved to third ahead of Amon, Hulme, Pedro Rodriguez (BRM) and Jochen Rindt (Brabham). In the early laps, the order switched around considerably. Surtees dropped back through the field as his engine overheated and Rindt disappeared with an ignition problem. Jacky Ickx was back in action in his Ferrari after missing the US Grand Prix because of a leg injury but his race was also short-lived because of an ignition failure. Stewart took the lead for several laps but Hill passed him again while Hulme ran third until his car began to handle oddly and Siffert overtook him. Hulme retired on lap 11, when a rear suspension failure sent him into a guardrail, bringing to an end his World Championship challenge. It was now a straight fight between Hill and Stewart although Siffert decided to get in on the act and took the lead on lap 22. He then had to pit with a broken throttle cable and so it was Hill and Stewart again at the front. They were well clear of third-placed Brabham. And then Stewart began to drop back quickly with a fuel feed problem. The engine began to misfire and the handling also went awry. On lap 51, McLaren and Brabham both overtook him (the New Zealander having overtaken the Australian earlier). Brabham&#x27;s race ended soon afterwards with an engine problem and as Johnny Servoz-Gavin also went out with an engine problem it was left to Oliver to take third place behind Hill and McLaren. Stewart ended up back in seventh position. Hill was World Champion for the second time.

<text>The 1967 Formula One season was the 21st season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 18th World Championship of Drivers, the 10th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and six non-championship races open to Formula One cars. The World Championship was contested over eleven races between 2 January and 22 October 1967.

Denny Hulme won the Drivers&#x27; Championship in a Brabham-Repco. Brabham was also awarded the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers. , this is the only championship won by a New Zealand driver. Hulme also became the first driver in World Championship history to win the title without having scored a pole position during the season.

Lorenzo Bandini crashed during the Monaco Grand Prix. Losing an early lead of the race and trying to get back to the front, the Ferrari driver clipped the chicane at the harbour front and then hit a hidden mooring. The car turned over and exploded in flames. It took marshals several minutes to extricate Bandini from the burning wreck and three days later, the Italian died. British driver Bob Anderson died during a test at Silverstone. His Brabham slid off the track in wet conditions and hit a marshals post, suffering serious chest and neck injuries and later dying in hospital.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1967 FIA World Championship. A pink background denotes additional Formula 2 entrants to the German Grand Prix on the very long Nürburgring track.

===Team and driver changes===
* After his success in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, Chris Amon was offered a seat at the Ferrari F1 team. It would be the New Zealander&#x27;s first full-time F1 drive since .
* Pedro Rodríguez was signed by Cooper, after 1964 champion John Surtees moved to Honda. Honda&#x27;s drivers Richie Ginther and Ronnie Bucknum left the sport.
* champion Graham Hill moved from BRM to Lotus, replacing Peter Arundell. Mike Spence was hired as his replacement at BRM, having gained experience with their V8 engine at Reg Parnell&#x27;s privateer team.

====Mid-season changes====
* Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini suffered a fatal crash during the Monaco Grand Prix. The team brought back last year&#x27;s drivers Mike Parkes and Ludovico Scarfiotti for two races and then reduced their operations to just one car for Chris Amon.
* Bruce McLaren had switched from Ford to BRM engines over the winter. He was supposed to get V12 engines for the McLaren M5A, but when those were delayed, he had to start the season in a modified Formula Two car powered by a BRM V8.
* After having worked with engine suppliers Climax and BRM since , Lotus switched to newly developed Cosworth DFV&#x27;s from the third race of this year. The project was funded by the Ford Motor Company.
* Pedro Rodríguez suffered a crash in the 1967 Mediterranean Grand Prix, a Formula Two race at Autodromo di Pergusa, and took about two months to recover. Richard Attwood and Jacky Ickx fell in for him at Cooper. It was Ickx&#x27;s F1 debut, while he would go on to win the F2 championship that year as well.
* Matra introduced their first Formula One chassis, the MS7, in the last two races of the season, with their Formula Two driver Jean-Pierre Beltoise granted the drive.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The South African Grand Prix returned to the calendar but it was held at the Kyalami Circuit instead of the Prince George Circuit.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was brought forward from mid July to early June, ahead of the Belgian and French Grand Prix.
* The French Grand Prix was moved to the Bugatti version of the Circuit de la Sarthe, replacing Reims-Gueux.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.
* The Canadian Grand Prix was hosted for the first time, at Mosport Park near Toronto.

==Regulation changes==
After Lorenzo Bandini&#x27;s fatal accident, the FIA banned circuit organisers from using straw bales along the track and TV crews from flying their helicopters too low, as both had contributed to the fire flaring up.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 4===
Coming down from his third World Championship in , Jack Brabham started this year off as well, with a pole position at the South African Grand Prix. Teammate Denny Hulme started second and two-time World Champion Jim Clark lined up in third in his Lotus. Hulme took the lead at the start, while Clark fell back to sixth. In a race of attrition, the crowd saw Rhodesian driver John Love take the lead. When he had to stop for extra fuel, however, it was Pedro Rodríguez who won in his Cooper. Love finished second, ahead of John Surtees in a Honda. Hulme and Brabham finished several laps down but still in the points, since there were just six classified finishers in total.

From 1967 to , there was four months between the first and second race of the championship, and most teams would usually run the first race with old designs, or not even participate. This year, Ferrari, McLaren and Matra started their year with the Monaco Grand Prix. Lotus had planned to run revolutionary new Cosworths, but they were not ready in time. Jack Brabham scored pole position like in South Africa, but again lost the lead at the start, this time to long-time Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini. Before long, Hulme took over at the front and increased his lead to 15 seconds. Desperately trying to get closer, Bandini struck the barrier in the chicane at the harbour front and mounted the straw bales. The car landed upside down and exploded in flames. Bandini would succumbed to his injuries three days later. Hulme won the race, one lap ahead of Graham Hill (Lotus) and two ahead of Chris Amon (Ferrari). Like in the first race, there were just six finishers.
When Lotus could finally run the new Cosworth engines in the Dutch Grand Prix, their pace was significantly better than before and Hill snatched pole position. A surprising Dan Gurney in the Eagle started second, reigning champion Brabham in third. After drivers had to avoid a wandering marshal on the grid, the positions at the front remained rather the same, until Gurney made a pit stop. Hill&#x27;s engine suddenly seized on lap 11, but teammate Clark was charging, getting up to second on lap 15 and taking the lead from Brabham on the next lap. He kept increasing his lead with a second per lap and easily won, ahead of the teammates Brabham and Hulme. Behind them finished the three Ferraris.

Qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix ended up with quite the same drivers at the front, except Brabham could only manage seventh. Clark, Gurney and Hill occupied the front row. Clark was the only one of the three with a good start, however. During the first lap, Mike Parkes crashed his Ferrari and was thrown out. He broke a leg and wrist and would not return to Formula One. At the front of the field, Clark was followed by Stewart (BRM) and Amon (Ferrari), before Amon fell back and Gurney took third. Then, Clark had to pit to change a spark plug and Stewart ran into trouble with his gearbox, and Gurney took the lead. After setting a new lap record, the American driver won, over a minute ahead of Stewart and Amon.

Four different winners led to a close fight at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Denny Hulme (Brabham) was first with 16 points, ahead of Pedro Rodríguez (Cooper) and Chris Amon (Ferrari) with 11. In the battle for the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup, Brabham had scored 18 points, ahead of Cooper (14) and Ferrari (11).

===Rounds 5 to 7===
For the French Grand Prix, the front row consisted of champion Graham Hill (Lotus), triple World Champion Jack Brabham (Brabham) and winner of the last race, Dan Gurney (Eagle). But after just 5 laps, it was fourth-starting Jim Clark who led the field. Before the race reached half distance, however, both Lotuses had retired. The Cosworth engines deemed fast but unreliable. After Gurney retired as well with a fuel leak, which left Brabham and his teammate Hulme to finish first and second. Jackie Stewart finished third in his BRM, a lap down on the leader. For the third time this year, there were just six classified finishers.

The British Grand Prix was run at Silverstone and saw the green-and-yellow Lotuses (Clark ahead of Hill) qualifying in front of the green-and-gold Brabhams (Brabham ahead of Hulme). The Lotus duo gained a big lead over the rest, before Hill took the lead on lap 26. When a screw in his suspension failed, however, he had to pit on lap 55, and his engine seized ten laps later. Clark took a comfortable win, ahead of Hulme and Amon, the Ferrari driver having passed Brabham four laps from the end.

During practice for the German Grand Prix, Hill crashed and wrote off his Lotus, while escaping uninjured. Clark clinched pole position, ahead of Hulme and Formula Two driver Jacky Ickx. (Traditionally, the F2 race would be run at the same time as the Grand Prix. F2 drivers would not be eligible to score points for the F1 championship.) At the start, Clark and Hulme led away, with Bruce McLaren stealing third. On lap 3, Clark&#x27;s right-rear wheel was deflating slowly and he had to back off. Dan Gurney inherited the lead after McLaren retired with an oil leak. The American set a new lap record, despite an extra chicane having been added to the circuit, and increased his lead over Hulme to over 40 seconds. On lap 13, however, his Eagle&#x27;s drive shaft broke and cut through an oil pipe, handing Hulme a lucky victory, ahead of teammate Brabham and Ferrari driver Amon.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Denny Hulme (Brabham) was leading with 37 points, ahead of Jack Brabham (Brabham) with 25 points and Jim Clark (Lotus) and Chris Amon (Ferrari) in a shared third place with 19 points. Brabham was leading the championship for the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup with 42 points, ahead of Coopper with 21 and Lotus and Ferrari in a shared third place with 19 points.

===Rounds 8 to 11===
The Canadian Grand Prix was on the championship calendar for the first time and was supposed to be a one-off in celebration of Canada&#x27;s 100 years of independence, but the popularity of the event would result in F1 returning to Mosport Park seven more years and the Canadian GP still being featured on the calendar today. Jim Clark (Lotus) qualified on pole position, ahead of teammate Graham Hill and championship leader Denny Hulme (Brabham). It had been a rainy night, but a clear morning, which led to most of the Goodyear runners starting on intermediate tyres, while most of the Firestone started on dries. During the warm-up lap, the rain returned and it caused a treacherous first lap, with the Goodyear times at an advantage. Hulme took the lead off of Clark, and Bruce McLaren got by the pole-sitter into second place. The track was now drying and around a quarter of the race, the dry-runners regained their advantage. Clark retook second place and began to catch Hulme at over a second a lap. On lap 58, he was there and immediately went by into the lead, but right at that moment, the rain returned. Clark&#x27;s engine got soaked and cut out, while Hulme desperatly needed clean goggles so chose to pit. This left Jack Brabham, second in the championship, free to win the race, over a minute ahead of teammate Hulme and at least a lap ahead of the race. Dan Gurney finished third in the Eagle.

Qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix was disrupted by rain, but the result was not surprising: Clark scored his fifth pole position of the year, ahead of Brabham and McLaren. Hulme started in sixth. The marshal starting the race used a different procedure to what the drivers were used to, which led to half of the grid essentially doing a false start, but no penalties were issued. Brabham took the lead before Gurney grabbed it later in the lap, while Hill and Clark followed them. On lap 3, Clark was already back in the lead, but then suffered a slow puncture. With the pole-sitter in the pits and Gurney&#x27;s engine having broken, as it had done so many times, it was Hulme who took over the lead. Brabham and Hill formed a close trio with him and the lead swapped hands a couple of times. Clark had a lost a full lap with his pit stop, but managed to unlap himself with two thirds of the race still to go, and quickly set a new lap record. Hulme retired with an overheating engine and Hill took advantage from Clark&#x27;s slipstream to open up the gap to Brabham at two seconds per lap, until on lap 58, his engine exploded. His rivals&#x27; retirements, topped with his maniacal pace, brought Clark up to second place, with leader Brabham in his sights and Honda driver John Surtees in third place, the champion this time being the one to benefit from Clark&#x27;s tow. On lap 60, Clark grabbed the lead and gained a three-second advantage, until he dramatically ran out of fuel. Surtees took the lead and was side-by-side with Brabham going into the last corner. Brabham dove to the inside but slid wide. Surtees crossed back and took the flag with a margin of just 0.2 seconds. It would be Honda&#x27;s last win until . Clark coasted over the line in third place.
The Brabham duo (Hulme and Brabham) were leading the championship but the Lotus duo (Hill and Clark) that occupied the first row for the United States Grand Prix. Gurney had started beside them, took second place at the start and even started pressuring the leader. After just 24 laps, however, the home hero retired with a broken suspension, but the Lotuses were showing better pace anyway. Clark took over the lead when Hill suffered issues with his clutch. This gave Ferrari driver Chris Amon a chance for second place, but his engine ran out of oil with 12 laps to go. Clark would take a comfortable victory, but two laps from the end, his right-rear suspension broke. By slowing down and managing to keep the car on track, Hill could not catch up in time, and Clark took the chequered flag. One could say it was the summary of the season: the Lotuses were unreliable and finished less than half of the races, but if they did, they were so fast that they lapped the rest of the field. This time, it was Hulme who finished in third, a lap down.

Going into the final race, the Mexican Grand Prix, Hulme had a lead of five points in the standings, so if Brabham wanted to do anything about it, he needed to win and for his teammate to finish fifth or lower. Clark started again on pole position, with Brabham and Hulme down in fifth and sixth, respectively. Hill shortly took the lead, but Clark grabbed it back and grew his advantage to seven seconds. Hulme was comfortably hanging back six seconds behind Brabham. Hill retired when his drive shaft broke and had damaged his engine, and the race settled down. Clark set a new lap record and lapped everyone but Brabham in second. Hulme finished third, enough to win the title.

Denny Hulme (Brabham, 51 points) won his first and only championship, ahead of teammate Jack Brabham (46) and Jim Clark (Lotus, 41). Hulme is the only champion to date from New Zealand, and the first of two drivers to win the title without achieving a pole position in the season. Only Niki Lauda would repeat this feat in . The Brabham team (63 points) also won the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup, ahead of Lotus (44) and Cooper (28).

==Results and standings==

===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Formula 2 cars were not eligible for Championship points. The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. For both the Championship and the Cup, the best five results from rounds 1-6 and the best four results from rounds 7-11 were counted.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===


*1 – Ineligible for Formula One points, because they drove with Formula Two cars.

=== International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings ===
*Bold results counted to championship totals.

<text>The 1966 Formula One season was the 20th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 17th World Championship of Drivers, the 9th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and four non-championship races open to Formula One cars. The World Championship was contested over nine races between 22 May and 23 October 1966.

Jack Brabham won the Drivers&#x27; Championship in a Brabham-Repco. It was his third and last championship. Brabham was also awarded the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, their first title.

John Taylor collided with Formula Two driver Jacky Ickx during the German Grand Prix. Taylor was badly burned in the accident and succumbed to his injuries four weeks later.

The season saw &quot;the return to power&quot;, with the FIA doubling the maximum allowed engine displacement from 1.5 to 3 litres.

==Championship teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1966 FIA World Championship.

* Pink background denotes F2 entrants to the German Grand Prix

===Team and driver changes===

Dubbed &quot;the return to power&quot;, the new formula of 3 litre naturally-aspirated engines was met with enthusiasm. Not all projects were finished in time for the start of the season, however. Coventry Climax had decided to quit their business of building racing engines, despite winning their latest championship in , so most British teams had to find new contracts:
* Brabham collaborated with Australian company Repco. Their 3-litre V8 was ready in time.
* Cooper worked with Maserati to receive an updated version of their engines.
* Lotus had put their hope in a new H16 engine design from BRM, but it was finished too late and very heavy. So they began the season with a hastily prepared and uncompetitive 2 litre Climax V8. (The team would return to their winning form after a switch to Cosworth DFV engines for .) Peter Arundell was back at Lotus, having recovered from his crash during the season. Mike Spence, who had replaced him in , was signed by the private Reg Parnell Racing team.
Two teams made their debut this year:
* Bruce McLaren had left Cooper to set up his own team. He entered the McLaren M2B, designed by Robin Herd. During the season, McLaren trialled a Ford V8 and a Serenissima V8, switching around multiple times but not finding the right recipe.
* Dan Gurney departed from Brabham to also enter his own team. He had worked with famous car designer Carroll Shelby since to set up All American Racers. They built an F1 chassis, dubbed the &#x27;Eagle Mk1&#x27;, and Gurney drove the car himself. The chassis was delayed until the second race of the season and the new Weslake 3 litre V12 was only ready with three races left. They used Climax four-stroke engines until then.

====Mid-season changes====
* Honda missed a good part of the races in 1966 but was back on the grid with a new 3 litre V12 engine in the Italian Grand Prix. Richie Ginther left Cooper after two races to make his return to the Japanese team.
* champion John Surtees was not allowed by Ferrari operations manager Eugenio Dragoni to enter the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli favoured his nephew Ludovico Scarfiotti. When CEO Enzo Ferrari also did not support Surtees, the Brit left the team, thereby also abandoning his F1 drive. Mike Parkes and Scarfiotti, who both did drive the Le Mans race, were promoted to the F1 team, while Surtees took Ginther&#x27;s place at Cooper.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The South African Grand Prix at the Prince George Circuit was relegated to non-championship status, because 1.5 litre engines were allowed on the grid while that was no longer the case in the F1 championship.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from the Charade Circuit to Reims-Gueux.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* A new engine formula was introduced, heralded as &quot;the return of power&quot;. The maximum allowed engine displacement was doubled from 1.5 to 3 litres for naturally-aspirated engines. Compressed engines (using a turbocharger or supercharger) were allowed for the first time since , with a maximum engine displacement of 1.5 litres.
* The minimum weight was raised from to .

===Sporting regulations===
* Driver completing less than 90% of the race distance would not be classified and did not receive points, even if they finished in the top six.
* The maximum race distance was reduced from to .

==Championship report==

===Rounds 1 to 3===
The 1966 season started off with the Monaco Grand Prix. The twisty track seemed for a large part to negate the difference in power between the 3 litre Ferrari engines and the 2 litre BRM and Climax engines (used by Lotuses). and champion Jim Clark qualified on pole position in the Lotus-Climax, ahead of champion John Surtees for Ferrari. On the second row started the two BRMs of Jackie Stewart and champion Graham Hill. At the start, Clark&#x27;s car got jammed in first gear and was passed by everyone. Surtees and Stewart created a gap to the rest of the field. Under normal circumstances, the Ferrari would soon leave the BRM behind, but Surtees&#x27; rear axle failed and he retired on lap 16. Stewart was out on his own, followed by Jochen Rindt in the Cooper-Maserati and Hill, before Lorenzo Bandini rose up to second place in the Ferrari. Clark was charging back to the front of the field, but spent a lot of time behind Hill. Clark dove through into the first corner to take third place - Rindt had retired with engine failure - but the Lotus&#x27;s left-rear suspension failed later in the lap and the reigning champion was out of the race. Stewart held on to take his second career win, ahead of Bandini and Hill. Bob Bondurant finished in fourth place to get three BRMs in the points. Behind came three Coopers but none of them were classified and did not receive championship points.

At first, Stewart was setting the pace during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix, but on the high-speed circuit, Surtees qualified on pole in his Ferrari, more than three seconds ahead of Rindt in the Cooper-Maserati. Stewart started third, while Clark could only manage tenth. As the flag was waved, rain was falling at the far end of the track. Stewart and Hill crashed in the &quot;Masta Kink&quot;, already known as the most dangerous corner, and the Scot got trapped under his car in a pool of leaking fuel for 25 minutes. Hill and Bondurant, who had both crashed as well, borrowed a spectator&#x27;s toolkit to free him. Another five cars retired within the first lap of the race, including Clark. Surtees led the race, ahead of Rindt and Bandini, and that became the finishing order as well. Behind them finished and champion Jack Brabham and Rindt&#x27;s teammate Richie Ginther. Two other drivers were still running but were not classified, making it two races in a row that championship points were held back under the new rule. Following his crash, Stewart became a strong advocate of improving driver safety in not only Grand Prix but motor racing in general.

When Surtees was not granted a drive with Ferrari in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, he left the Italian team and, with that, gave up his F1 drive as well. He found a seat at Cooper, where Ginther had left to return to his old team Honda. Bandini qualified on pole for the French Grand Prix, with old teammate Surtees and new teammate Mike Parkes beside him on the first row. At the start, Surtees fell back with fuel pick-up issues, before he retired on lap 5. Brabham got up to second place, the only driver able to follow Bandini&#x27;s pace. On lap 32, the Australian inherited the lead as the Ferrari&#x27;s throttle cable broke. The Italian took a piece of string from a straw bale lining the track and tied it to his throttle, operating it by hand and actually nursing his car back to the pits, but finished out of the points. Brabham won the race, ahead of Parkes in his first race and Brabham&#x27;s teammate Denny Hulme.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jack Brabham (Brabham-Repco) took the lead with 12 points, ahead of Lorenzo Bandini (Ferrari, 10 points), followed by Surtees, Stewart and Rindt (all 9 points). In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Ferrari had the lead with 21 points, ahead of Brabham (12) and BRM and Cooper (both 9).

===Rounds 4 to 6===
The British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch saw the Brabham duo of Jack Brabham and Denny Hulme qualify at the front, ahead of Dan Gurney in the Eagle, Graham Hill for BRM and Jim Clark for Lotus. Next came John Surtees in the Cooper, to make it five different constructors in the top six. At the start, it was Brabham and Hill who led away, until it started raining and Jochen Rindt pitted for rain tyres. Rindt got up to second place, pressing Brabham for the lead, while Surtees was third. As the rain dried, however, Rindt fell back and Surtees retired, leaving Brabham and Hulme to finish first and second. Behind them came Hill, Clark and Rindt.
Brabham and Hulme again qualified first and second for the Dutch Grand Prix, ahead of Clark, still driving a 2 litre Climax-powered Lotus. Hulme&#x27;s engine went wrong on lap 17, eventually retiring on lap 37, and leaving Brabham vulnerable to Clark&#x27;s offense. While lapping some backmarkers, the Brit passed the Australian and pulled out a substantial lead. At half-distance, Graham Hill was the only driver not lapped by Clark and Brabham, but then, a shock absorber on the Lotus&#x27;s crankshaft broke and punched a hole in the water pump, leading to his engine coolant to leak away. This forced a pit stop and brought him down to third place. Brabham won his third race in a row, ahead of Hill.
The German Grand Prix was run at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. In fear of a dull race with not enough entries, the FIA allowed Formula Two entries to race simultaneously. They would not be eligible for F1 championship points. The lighter 2 litre cars topped the timings in qualifying, with Clark, Surtees and Stewart occupying the front row. But at the start, the more powerful 3 litre cars got away better: Surtees held the lead, but Brabham and Lorenzo Bandini were his nearest rivals. John Taylor spun off in the rain that had started falling. He got trapped in a burning wreck but was rescued by F2 driver Jacky Ickx. At the end of the first lap, Brabham had taken the lead, ahead of Surtees, Rindt and Clark. The latter crashed out of the race on lap 11, while the podium places remained unchanged.

After winning four consecutive races, Jack Brabham (Brabham) had a sizeable lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 39 points, ahead of Graham Hill (BRM, 17 points) and John Surtees and Jochen Rindt (teammates at Cooper, both on 15 points). In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Brabham led with 39 points, ahead of Ferrari (23) and BRM (22).

===Rounds 7 to 9===

The teams that had had to make due with limited power until now, could finally take delivery of new 3 litre engines for the Italian Grand Prix: BRM introduced H16 engines for the works team and their customer Team Lotus, the Eagle was powered by the new Weslake V12, and Honda were on the grid for the first time this year with their own V12. Much to the joy of the tifosi, Ferrari teammates Mike Parkes and Ludovico Scarfiotti qualified at the front, ahead of Jim Clark (Lotus), John Surtees (Cooper) and Lorenzo Bandini (Ferrari). Championship leader Jack Brabham started in sixth but felt not much pressure, as Surtees had to win all three remaining races to stop the Australian from claiming the title. Scarfiotti took the lead at the start but was down to seventh at the end of the first lap. His teammate Bandini replaced him at the front. Brabham went by on lap 4 but then retired with an oil leak. Successively, Surtees, Bandini and Clark retired as well, giving the lead back to Scarfiotti, ahead of Parkes and Denny Hulme (Brabham). Jochen Rindt&#x27;s front tyre deflated coming out of the last corner, the Austrian crossing the finish line while spinning and eventually ending up in the grass. With Surtees&#x27; retirement, Brabham had clinched the Drivers&#x27; Championship of 1966.

As per usual, the championship ended overseas, firstly with the United States Grand Prix. Freshly crowned champion Brabham qualified on pole with last year&#x27;s champion Clark next to him. Bandini started third but quickly took the lead, before Brabham went back through on lap 10. Bandini later repassed the Australian but then retired with an engine failure. Halfway through the race, Brabham retired as well. Clark had been left behind by the leading duo but inherited the race win. Rindt ran out of fuel and slowed down. He did finish the race, but his last lap took so long that it was forfeited, putting him a lap behind but still second in the classification, as Surtees in third was even further behind.

The last round of the season, the Mexican Grand Prix, saw Surtees back on pole, for the first time in a Cooper, ahead of Clark and Ginther. The Honda driver took the lead at the start, leading fifth-starting Rindt and fourth-starting Brabham. Surtees fell down to fifth but had charged back to first at the half-way point. He won the race, seven seconds ahead of Brabham and at least a lap ahead of Hulme and the rest of the field.

Jack Brabham had won the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 42 points, ahead of John Surtees (28) and Jochen Rindt (22). Jack It was Brabham&#x27;s third Drivers&#x27; Championship (following wins in and ), moving him into the second place in the record standings, behind five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio. He became the first and, so far, only driver to win the championship in a car carrying his own name. The Brabham team also scored 42 points in the Manufacturers&#x27; Champions and won the title, ahead of Ferrari (31 points) and Cooper (30 points).

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Formula 2 cars were not eligible for Championship points.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best five results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

*1 – Ineligible for Formula One points, because he drove with a Formula Two car.

=== International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings ===

*Bold results counted to championship totals.

==Non-championship races==
Four other Formula One races were held in 1966, which did not count towards the World Championship.

==Grand Prix – the movie of the 1966 Formula One season==
The film &quot;Grand Prix&quot; is a fictionalized version of the 1966 season, which includes footage of the actual races edited together with footage of actors in staged racing scenes.

<text>The 1965 Formula One season was the 19th season of FIA Formula One racing. It featured the 16th World Championship of Drivers, the 8th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and seven non-championship races open to Formula One cars. The World Championship was contested over ten races between 1 January and 24 October 1965.

Jim Clark won the Drivers&#x27; Championship in a Lotus-Climax. It was his second and last championship. Lotus were also awarded the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers for the second time.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1965 FIA World Championship.
===Driver changes===
Three future champions made their debuts in 1965:
* Jackie Stewart replaced Richie Ginther at BRM, after the American driver was invited to join the Honda F1 team.
* Denny Hulme was signed by Brabham, racing with team owner Jack Brabham and veteran Dan Gurney.
* Having entered one race in , Jochen Rindt was offered a full-time seat at Cooper, after champion Phil Hill had retired from single-seater racing.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The South African Grand Prix was moved forward a week, which meant it would not be the last round of 1964 but the first round of 1965.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Rouen-Les-Essarts to Charade Circuit for a year.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was moved from the middle of May to the middle of July.
* The Austrian Grand Prix was run as a sports car race.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 3===
For the first time, the championship started in South Africa, and it did on the very first day of the year. Sixteen drivers were invited to the event and guaranteed a place on the grid. There were four places remaining, but fourteen drivers applied. Through pre-qualifying and subsequent qualifying, the grid was filled. The drivers started in order of their fastest qualifying times: champion Jim Clark in his Lotus-Climax was on pole position, ahead of champion John Surtees (Ferrari) and and champion Jack Brabham (Brabham). After the start, Clark led away with his teammate Mike Spence up to second. Not many changes in positions happened after that, until Brabham&#x27;s engine started misfiring, leaking oil, and sending Spence in a spin on the next lap. The podium was taken by Clark, Surtees and champion Graham Hill (BRM). Spence and Brabham finished fourth and eighth, respectively.

Just short of a full five months later, the Monaco Grand Prix was held and for this race, the organisers guaranteed one place on the grid for each factory team. The rest of the applicants had to be fast enough during qualifying to gain a starting ticket. In disagreement, Lotus decided to withdraw from the event, instead entering the Indianapolis 500 a day later. Hill started on pole position, ahead of Brabham and Hill&#x27;s teammate Jackie Stewart. Brabham fell back and the two BRMs led away. Hill lost a lot of time when he had to avoid a backmarker, going up the escape road and having to push his car back onto the track. On lap 30, Stewart spun coming out of the fastest corner, before Brabham&#x27;s Climax engine seized. Hill made it back into the lead, ahead of the Ferraris of Bandini and Surtees. Richard Attwood crashed in the hairpin, the leaders narrowly avoiding him, before Paul Hawkins crashed into the harbour. His car sank to the bottom but Hawkins was unhurt, as was Attwood. Hill took the win, ahead of Bandini and Stewart, after Surtees ran out of fuel with a lap to go.

For the Belgian Grand Prix, Hill started on pole again, ahead of Clark and Stewart. Rain fell and everyone held a safe distance from the car in front, except Clark, who took the lead through the most dangerous corner on the track, the &quot;Masta Kink&quot;. He quickly pulled out a big lead and even lapped Hill. Stewart finished second, ahead of Bruce McLaren, Brabham and Hill. Attwood crashed at &quot;Masta&quot;, his Lotus breaking in half and catching fire, but the driver escaping with only minor burns.

Jim Clark (Lotus) was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 18 points, ahead of Graham Hill (BRM, 15) and debutant Jackie Stewart (BRM, 11). In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, BRM was leading with 19 points, ahead of Lotus (18) and Ferrari (12).

===Rounds 4 to 7===
The French Grand Prix was run for the first time at the Circuit de Charade, which was described as a quicker, twistier version of the Nürburgring. Championship leader Jim Clark qualified his Lotus on pole position, ahead of two &quot;number two drivers&quot;: Jackie Stewart (BRM) and Lorenzo Bandini (Ferrari). Their respective team leaders, Graham Hill and John Surtees, started thirteenth and fourth. Except from Bandini&#x27;s accident on lap 36, the race finished as it started: Clark claimed another Grand Slam victory, ahead of Stewart and Surtees. Hill recovered to fifth.

The British Grand Prix was run at Silverstone, where Clark scored another pole position, ahead of Hill and Honda driver Richie Ginther. At the start, Ginther challenged Clark for the lead, but fell back to fourth and then retired on lap 26. Surtees was fighting for third place against Lotus driver Mike Spence, while his team leader suddenly slowed down. The Climax engine was losing oil and Clark was coasting round the corners, only using power on the straights. Hill did anything within his might to chase his rival down, but the Lotus hang on to finish with 3 seconds to spare. Surtees came in third.
The Dutch Grand Prix was run just a week later and all eyes were on Clark. It was his rival Hill, however, that scored pole position. Clark started in second, Ginther again in third. Moments before the flag fell, Lotus team owner Colin Chapman was involved in a brawl with the Dutch police. It would result in his arrest and a two-day imprisonment. The race went on unhindered, however, and saw Ginther take the lead. On lap 5, Hill and Clark were back at the front, with the Lotus soon getting ahead. Hill then lost second place to his teammate Stewart and third place to Brabham driver Dan Gurney. Clark scored his fifth win of the season, ahead of Stewart, his fourth podium, and Gurney, his first podium of the year.

It was Clark on top again during qualifying for the German Grand Prix, with more than 3 seconds over the BRMs of Stewart and Hill. At the start, Surtees&#x27;s gearbox went wrong and he fell back. It would lead to his retirement on lap 11. Clark and Hill were fighting for the lead, while Stewart&#x27;s suspension failed and he handed third place to Gurney. Clark broke the lap record a couple of times and won his fifth consecutive race. It was the first time since Jack Brabham in that a driver achieved this feat. Hill was second, Gurney third.

Jim Clark (Lotus) was still leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship, now at 54 points, ahead of Graham Hill (BRM, 30) and Jackie Stewart (BRM, 25). Hill would have to win the remaining three races to prevent Clark from becoming champion. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Lotus led with 54 points, ahead of BRM (39) and Scuderia Ferrari (21).

===Rounds 8 to 10===

Championship favourite Jim Clark (Lotus) achieved his fifth pole position of the year at the Italian Grand Prix, ahead of John Surtees for Ferrari and Jackie Stewart for BRM. At the start, Surtees had problems with his clutch, so Clark and Stewart were followed by Graham Hill, who had to finish first to stay in the race for the championship. The top three were engaged in a &quot;slipstream battle&quot; and the lead changed hands lap after lap. With ten laps to go, Clark suddenly stopped with a failing fuel pump, so Hill and Stewart were free to fight over the win in equal machinery. Going into the last lap, Hill touched the grass with his outer wheels, almost spinning but certainly valuable seconds. Stewart won his first race, with Hill in second and Dan Gurney in third. Despite Clark&#x27;s retirement, Hill&#x27;s second place meant that the 1965 championship was now decided.

Hill started on pole for the United States Grand Prix, ahead of Clark and Honda driver Richie Ginther. Clark quickly grabbed the lead but soon retired with a broken piston. As it had happened more often, Ginther fell back, while his American rival Gurney went up the order. He came within four seconds of Hill when the Brit slid off the track, but when he made a mistake himself, his team leader Jack Brabham took second place. The Australian challenged Hill for the lead, but was unable to get by, and then became the third top-runner to take to the grass. The order at the finish was Hill, Gurney, Brabham. Lotus clinched the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, seeing that BRM could no longer catch them in the last race.

The season ended with the Mexican Grand Prix, where Clark scored another pole position, ahead of Americans Gurney and Ginther. The Honda driver took the lead at the start, while Stewart got up to second, before being passed by Mike Spence. His teammate Clark suffered his third consecutive retirement, before Stewart went out at the half-way point, and Hill&#x27;s engine gave out with ten laps to go. Gurney passed Spence for second place and came within 3 seconds of the leader, but Ginther held on to his and Honda&#x27;s first win.

Jim Clark (Lotus) was awarded the 1965 Drivers&#x27; Championship after scoring 54 points, ahead of Graham Hill (BRM, 40) and Jackie Stewart (BRM, 33). Lotus clinched the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship as well, with 54 points, ahead of BRM (45), with Brabham just overtaking Ferrari for third place (27 and 26 points, respectively).

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Only the best six results counted towards the championship.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best six results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===
=== International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings ===
*Bold results counted to championship totals.

==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One races were also held in 1965, which did not count towards the World Championship. The last of them, the 1965 Rand Grand Prix, was the first Formula One race for cars with 3-litre engines.

<doc id="1140100" wikidata="Q702385" url="?curid=1140100" title="Revell">
<text>Revell GmbH is an American-origin manufacturer of plastic scale models, currently based in Bünde, Germany. The original Revell company merged with Monogram in 1986, becoming &quot;Revell-Monogram&quot;. The business operated until 2007, when American Revell was purchased by Hobbico, while the German subsidiary &quot;Revell Plastics GmbH&quot; (established in 1956) had separated from the American firm in 2006 until Hobbico purchased it in 2012, bringing the two back together again under the same company umbrella. After the Hobbico demise in 2018, Quantum Capital Partners (QCP) acquired Revell.

Some of the scale products manufactured and commercialized by Revell are cars, aircraft, ships, and commercial vehicles.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Lewis H. Glaser, a California entrepreneur, founded a plastics molding firm called &quot;Precision Specialties&quot; in Hollywood in 1943. The company made a variety of products contracted for different companies, the first reportedly being a small washing machine. One of the first toy-related products were HO scale (1:87) train sets, including locomotives, and a variety of cars along with buildings. The building line was extensive, including a farm group, a suburban passenger station, and a variety of utility structures. Many of these originals were reproduced later in other scales. The toy line was marketed later under the brand name Revell. Reportedly, the name Revell came from the French word &quot;réveil&quot; meaning &quot;new beginning&quot;.

====Gowland and Highway Pioneers====
About 1950, Revell reproduced Maxwell and Ford Model T assembled toys originally designed by the Gowland Brothers in England, a company producing toys since 1932. According to noted collector Cecil Gibson, these did not sell well in England, but Revell had much better luck with the series in the U.S. The Revell box said, &quot;By John Gowland—creator of Champ and Chu Chu&quot;. The 1911 Maxwell and 1910 Model T were about 1:16 scale and called &quot;Action Pull Toys&quot;, which consisted of a wound thin metal cord with a plastic handle. The cord was attached through the front of the car to the rear axle. The car&#x27;s body was hinged, so when the plastic handle was pulled, the car bounced on the floor – with the driver bobbing up and down. The box advertised that these were &quot;Made in Hollywood&quot; and were called Revell &quot;Play Planned&quot; toys.
A couple of years later, these toys were scaled down and modeled as 3/8&quot; to a foot scale (four to five inches) and called &quot;Highway Pioneers Quick Construction&quot; kits—most without the rather cartoonish figures and without the mechanical &quot;action&quot;. These new 1:32 toys met with great success and sold much better than the larger Maxwell, even though it was made famous by Jack Benny&#x27;s radio show, circa 1943. The original larger cars were discontinued and Revell focused on the newer kits, with the Gowland hot air balloon logo still shown on the green, yellow, orange or blue boxes. Box information shows models were offered in at least four series, not including the Maxwell and four other Highway Pioneers released in UK (from the Hudson Miniature molds). Series one consisted of a 1900 Packard, 1903 Ford Model A, 1910 Ford Model T roadster, 1909 Stanley Steamer, and a 1903 Cadillac. Series two was 1914 Stutz Bearcat, 1915 Ford Model T Sedan, 1908 Buick Rumble, 1910 Studebaker, and a 1910 Cadillac (later the Olds delivery was substituted). Series three was the 1904 Oldsmobile (later the 1910 Cadillac was substituted), 1904 Rambler, 1907 Sears, 1910 Pierce Arrow, and a 1911 Rolls-Royce. Series Four included a 1915 Fiat, 1907 Renault, an MGTD, Jaguar 120 and 4,1 L Ferrari. Revell also offered gift sets of the five car series, and a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Kit&quot; set with ten individually wrapped kits of the Highway Pioneer models in one box.

Models in the &quot;Highway Pioneers&quot; series were commonly retooled and later offered by a number of other companies including Premier, Lincoln International, J &amp; L Randall Ltd (&quot;Merit&quot; brand), Lodela (licensed in Mexico) Crush, and Minicraft. Eventually the original Highway Pioneers tools were acquired by British model train manufacturer Dapol Ltd. The models are currently out of production and reportedly the tooling is located in Wales, headquarters of Dapol, along with redundant tools from Airfix, Kitmaster and Tri-ang Model Land. Some of these copies and knock-offs appeared very early and at the same time Revell was making them.

Revell acquire five non-Gowland designs, like the 1911 Maxwell offered by Hudson Miniatures of Scranton, Pennsylvania, appeared in 1952 under the &quot;Lil&#x27; Old Timers&quot; name. The Hudson Miniatures kits usually were manufactured with a small brochure giving historical facts on each vehicle. One preserved example sold around 1953 in Strouss-Hirshbergs for 69 cents; the box advertised the model as a &quot;Quickie-Kit&quot;. Revell, GB added these to the Highway Pioneer offerings in similar packaging to other US offering at that time. These five were later marketed by Heller as Cadet series and eventually were adapted with new tires in Germany. Ultimately two of the five and Gowland Rolls-Royce were marketed by SMER.

====Other 1950s offerings====

Several jet and propeller airplane models followed along with ships (classic and contemporary), jet engines, and in the late 1950s, rockets and spacecraft. This included models of Redstone and other military test missiles and Vanguard, Jupiter and Atlas rockets. Other issues, like the Helios &quot;Nuclear&quot;-powered ship, &quot;Moon Ship&quot;, a &quot;Passenger Rocket&quot;, a &quot;Space Taxi&quot;, and a not-so-incredible &quot;Space Shuttle&quot; were kits more in the science-fiction realm. One site describes the one-time 1959 issue of an envisioned space station as the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of Revell kits. Infantry figures and various dioramas, especially for railroad setups, were also produced.
In the later 1950s, Revell began making more automotive-related models. Beside jet engines, car engine models like the Chrysler Slant-Six were produced. Car models tended toward a more global selection than AMT or MPC or other American plastic model makers, with many European brands produced, including many British makes. One interesting offering came about with a collaboration with AMT making the 1955 and 1956 promotional Buick. The models were atypical for the time in that there was full chassis detail, and bodies were cast in several pieces. Revell made these specifically ready-built for showroom display. Another kit related to pop culture, was the 1956 Lincoln Futura concept car – a vehicle that, with out-of-this-world bubble windows, would eventually become George Barris&#x27;s Batmobile.

====The Kustom 1960s====
Starting in the late 1950s, model kits began to veer away strongly from stock presentations and focus on customizing, hot rodding, and racing. The 1960s solidified this direction with almost infinite variations in how a kit could be built. This trend showed both the extensive new marketing reach of the hobby as well as the pervasive individuality portrayed in American car customizing.
Model companies hired big name customizers to create new and striking designs. Just as AMT had hired George Barris and Darryl Starbird, Revell hired Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth about 1962 as their new stylist. Hawk Models would use Bill Campbell&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Weird-Ohs&quot; like &quot;Davey&quot; the wild motor-bike rider and &quot;Digger&quot; the dragster, and later, Monogram would hire designer Tom Daniel. At this time, Roth created the bubble-glassed &quot;Beatnik Bandit&quot; (later made even more famous when produced by Hot Wheels), the double engined &quot;Mysterion&quot;, the asymmetrical &quot;Orbitron&quot;, the &quot;Outlaw&quot; (a highly styled T bucket), and the &quot;Road Agent&quot;. Apart from wheeled wonders, arguably his most famous creation was the &quot;Rat Fink&quot;, an anti-Mickey Mouse figure. Roth&#x27;s Web site reports that in 1963 Revell paid Roth 1 cent for every one of his model kits sold, totaling $32,000.

In the early-to-mid-1960s, slot car racing became a fad, and like many other companies, Revell attempted to enter the fray by using its plastic model car bodies with mechanicals underneath—fit for the track. In 1965 Revell acquired International Raceways, planning high grade race tracks that could fill whole rooms. Soon thereafter, the company opened a &quot;Revell Raceway&quot; commercial slot car racing facility at 6840 La Tijera Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, actively demonstrating six track configurations that commercial slot car racing businesses could order for fabrication by Revell, with prices ranging from $2,500 to $8,000. &quot;One of the largest commercial model car raceways in the United States, being approximately 17,000 square feet, it features all the plush appointments and six tracks, the largest being 220 running feet with banked turns up to 60 degrees.&quot; It may have been too much too late: the competition was too keen and the slot car hobby was already starting to wane in influence. Slot car kings like Chicago&#x27;s Strombecker would eventually be purchased by Tootsietoy and end up making simple plastic cars and other toys. By 1967, Revell&#x27;s experiment in the hobby had racked up a nearly half-million dollar loss

====Money troubles and Monogram merger====

About 1980, as the modeling hobby was weakening in America and sales of plastic kits plummeted, Revell was purchased by French toy company, Generale du Jouet (also known as CEJI), which hoped to take advantage of Revell&#x27;s European division and presence. Still, Generale du Jouet was having financial troubles of its own, and by 1983 Revell was again spun off.

In 1986, after declining profitability in a new era of video games and cable television, Revell was purchased by Odyssey Partners of New York and folded into Monogram Models of Morton Grove, Illinois, which Odyssey had purchased earlier that year. Its plant in Venice was closed and all its usable assets were transferred to Monogram&#x27;s Number 2 plant in Des Plaines, Illinois. The new company then moved to Northbrook, Illinois. Due to the worldwide name recognition, Revell has become the primary brand name used on many of its kit lines, and after years of seeing both names on the logo, the Monogram name is now again portrayed separately. The company was then headquartered in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, United States.

Its major American competitors in the plastic model kit market include AMT-Ertl, Lindberg, and Testor.

====Revell in Germany====
In 1956, the German subsidiary, &quot;Revell Plastics GmbH&quot;, was founded in Bünde, West Germany. During the 1970s, this company started developing and manufacturing its own lines of model kits independently and outside the direct control of Revell, USA. These models were imported into the United States, and some of the newer kits earned a reputation for high quality. However, the &quot;German&quot; kits are now produced only in Eastern Europe or China under the German Revell label. Once known as Revell AG, the German company has now changed to the legal form of GmbH &amp; Co. KG. Revell Germany became independent after its formal separation from Revell-Monogram LLC in September 2006, but was purchased by Hobbico early in 2012, bringing both Revells back into the same company once again. While separate, the German products continued to be advertised on the American company web site, and its logo was almost identical to that of Revell in the United States. When it comes to total revenue, the German company ranked somewhat above the former American parent company.
Besides an array of airplane and military kits, Revell Germany has also made a variety of 1:24 and 1:18 scale accurately rendered pre-assembled die-cast model cars. These were first produced in the late 1980s and were typical Porsche, Ferrari, BMW and Mercedes-Benz offerings with some Corvettes and a 1965 Mustang. Starting around 2000, the company simplified its diecast line calling it simply, &quot;Revell Metal&quot;, as opposed to plastic seen in the kits. These later models have mostly been earlier German vehicles, with a focus on micro-cars. Examples are the Lloyd Alexander, Messerschmitt Kabinroller KR 200, BMW Isetta, and a very authentic looking DKW Junior.
Some models, like the Goggomobil T250 and the BMW Isetta came in a couple of trim versions. The Goggomobil appeared in a closed roof, austerely basic model as well as an open &quot;cloth&quot; roofed fancy decor version with whitewall tyres and chrome grille, which was probably not the popular model with less affluent German consumers of the real car just following World War II. The Isetta is appealing in miniature with opening front access door and &#x27;tilt-away&#x27; steering wheel. The model also features a removable side panel next to the location of the tiny engine. The BMW was available in several colors – with and without rear luggage rack and also in a special yellow &#x27;Bundespost&#x27; (German Mail) version.

Some of the larger vehicles featured have been the mid-1950s Mercedes-Benz 180 &quot;ponton&quot; sedan and a variety of European Fords, mainly from the 1960s. The postwar decade cars&#x27; interiors are consistently authentically decorated in period grey and white colours typical of the austerity of the times. A couple of more modern diecast models have been a VW Scirocco, BMW 850i coupe and an Acura NSX. Generally, German Revell diecast models all have opening doors, hoods and trunks.

=== Recent history ===
In 1994, Revell-Monogram was purchased by Hallmark Cards as part of its Binney and Smith division (the owners of famous Crayola crayons). In September of 2001 Binney &amp; Smith completed the sale of Revell-Monogram off to Alpha International. Alpha International is a Cedar Rapids, Iowa based company that specialized in diecast and collectible products.
Just a short year later, Alpha sells Revell-Monogram off to Gearbox Toys also of Cedar Rapids.. On May 2, 2007, Hobbico, Inc. announced it had acquired American Revell-Monogram, LLC, corporate owner of the Revell name. The Revell name now stands alone in the company logo, without the Monogram name also present, though Monogram still exists as an important line of models in the Revell catalogue. Hobbico also acquired Revell of Germany in 2012, reuniting the two brands under one banner, but often models sold in the U.S. show Revell Germany as the parent with Hobbico nowhere labeled.

On January 10, 2018, Hobbico, Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection.

On April 13, 2018, Revell USA temporarily ceased operations while they reorganized. On April 17, 2018, it was announced that international investment group Quantum Capital Partners (QCP) would be taking over operations of Revell. Their US-based tooling was sold to Atlantis Models, based in New York. Currently, Revell USA operates in conjunction with Carrera under the joint name &quot;Carrera-Revell&quot;. The company operates out of New Jersey and is regularly releasing new products.

As of 2023, the majority of Revell products are manufactured in Poland and China.

==Championship report==

===Rounds 1 to 4===
After a dominant season with seven wins in ten races, reigning champion Jim Clark was still in form for the first race of 1964, the Monaco Grand Prix. He qualified his Lotus-Climax on pole position, but Jack Brabham (world champion in and ) was just 0.1 seconds behind him in his Brabham-Climax. champion Graham Hill started in third for BRM and John Surtees fourth for Ferrari. Clark set a blistering pace from the start but went too fast through the harbour chicane and caught some straw bales lining the track. He was lucky to carry on without losing a position. Dan Gurney had started in fifth but overtook Hill and his teammate Brabham on lap 12. Brabham would later retire, as would Surtees. Clark pitted to fix the damage from his first-lap misstep, allowing Gurney and Hill to the front. Just past half-distance, Hill took the lead and Gurney retired with a failing gearbox. Surprisingly, Clark could not match Hill&#x27;s pace, but it did not matter anyway, since his Lotus developed an oil leak and he retired with four laps to go. Hill took the chequered flag, a lap ahead of his teammate Richie Ginther, awarding BRM a surprise 1-2 finish. Debutant Peter Arundell was third for Lotus, with his team leader being classified fourth to rack up valuable points.
Dan Gurney started on pole position at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the champions Jim Clark and Graham Hill next to him on the front row. Gurney was the first to brake for Tarzan corner, leaving the other two to fight it out side-by-side. It was Clark who just reached ahead and then never looked back. Gurney retired on lap 22, before Hill&#x27;s BRM developed a misfire. So the order almost automatically became Clark, Surtees, Arundell, and this remained until the finish.

For the Belgian Grand Prix, it was Gurney again on pole, ahead of Hill and Brabham. On the second row stood Arundell, Surtees and Clark. At the start, it was Arundell who reached Eau Rouge first, but after the first was complete, Gurney, Surtees and Clark were the top three. Surtees briefly advanced to the front before his Ferrari engine failed, leading to a second retirement in three races. Clark was now free to challenge Gurney but had to focus more on keeping Hill behind. They traded places a couple of time, allowing Bruce McLaren to join them in his Cooper. Gurney broke the lap record multiple times, growing his lead to 40 seconds, but unknowingly, was running low on fuel. He slowed down so much that Hill overtook him even before he reached the pits. But then on the last lap, Hill stopped with a failing fuel pump and McLaren&#x27;s car started spluttering heavily. His engine cut out with less than a kilometer to go, but the track went downhill, so the car was rolling towards the finish line at the bottom when Clark streaked by and narrowly took the victory. McLaren was second, Jack Brabham was third. Clark ran out of fuel during his cool-down lap, so he was brought back to the pits, seated on the engine cover of his teammate&#x27;s car.

The French Grand Prix saw no surprising names on the front and second rows, although due to the many retirements so far, the fastest drivers did not necessarily feature at the top of the provisional standings. Clark put his Lotus on pole position, ahead of Gurney and Surtees. Clark and Gurney quickly streaked ahead of the rest, while Surtees retired again. Clark set a new lap record and edged away from Gurney, until his engine lost a cylinder. He pitted, was sent out again, but then definitely retired. Gurney took an unchallenged victory, while Hill and Brabham fought over second placed, rubbing tires and flicking up dirt all the while. Hill took second place, Brabham third.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jim Clark (Lotus) stood on 21 points, ahead of Graham Hill (BRM) with 20 and both Richie Ginther (BRM) and Peter Arundell (Lotus) with 11 points. The Manufacturers&#x27; Championship saw Lotus on top with 25 points, ahead of BRM (21) and Brabham (14).

===Rounds 5 to 7===
The British Grand Prix was held at Brands Hatch for the first time and received the honorary title of &quot;European Grand Prix&quot;. Championship leader Jim Clark qualified his Lotus-Climax on pole position, ahead of main rival Graham Hill (BRM) and Dan Gurney (Brabham). Gurney got up to second at the start but had to pit on lap 3 with electrical problems. Hill pressured Clark during the whole race, but the Lotus driver held on to take the win. John Surtees finished third in his Ferrari.

During practice for the German Grand Prix, Dutch driver Carel Godin de Beaufort crashed his famous orange Porsche 718. He was rushed to hospital but would pass away two days later. Honda made their debut but their chassis and engine were marred by reliability problems. The organisers saw the PR value of the new team and scheduled an extra practice session, so that driver Ronnie Bucknum could reach the minimum of 5 laps required to qualify for the race. This gave local hero Gerhard Mitter the chance to do the same. Surtees qualified on pole, ahead of Clark and Gurney, but it was Surtees&#x27;s teammate Lorenzo Bandini that took the lead at the start. Surtees and Clark went by on the second lap, before Gurney started challenging the pair and snatched the lead away. The Ferrari and Brabham changed places a couple of times, while still lapping faster than Clark and Hill behind them, until Gurney, almost unsurprisingly at this stage, ran into technical issues. His engine was overheating. On lap 7, Clark retired, leaving Surtees to take the win, ahead of Hill and Bandini.

The first Austrian Grand Prix saw Hill score his first pole position, although he was the championship leader at this point. Surtees and Clark started with him on the first row. Hill and Clark bodged the start, which allowed fourth-starting Gurney to come through into the lead. Surtees overtook him on lap 2 but his rear suspension violently collapsed on lap 8. He became one of many victims of the airfield&#x27;s rough surface: Hill already on lap 5, the Lotuses of Clark and Spence on lap 40, and then Gurney retiring from the lead on lap 47. Ferrari&#x27;s Lorenzo Bandini took over at the front, ahead of Richie Ginther (BRM) and Jo Bonnier (Brabham). The latter&#x27;s engine gave up as well near the finish, the Swede still scoring a point in the end but allowing fellow privateer Bob Anderson into third place.

The Drivers&#x27; Championship looked set to become a one-on-one fight between the and champions: Graham Hill (BRM, 32 points) versus Jim Clark (Lotus, 30 points). John Surtees (Ferrari) was third with 19 points. BRM now also led the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship with 36 points, ahead of Lotus (34) and Ferrari (28).

===Rounds 8 to 10===
For the Italian Grand Prix, John Surtees (Ferrari) qualified on pole position, ahead of Dan Gurney (Brabham) and Graham Hill (BRM). Jim Clark (Lotus) started in fourth and got lucky at the start, because Hill&#x27;s clutch would not bite. Surprisingly, it was Bruce McLaren (Cooper) that converted his fifth starting position into the lead of the race. Then the traditional slipstreaming commenced: Gurney and Surtees both went by McLaren half-way into the first lap, Surtees took the lead on lap 2, before Gurney was back in front on lap 5. On lap 27, Clark joined Hill in retirement with a broken piston on the Climax, and on lap 68, Gurney&#x27;s engine began misfiring. He slowed his Brabham down, scoring no points for the sixth time this season, despite his outright pace. It left Surtees to take a comfortable win ahead of McLaren, who settled for &#x27;best-of-the-rest&#x27; quite early on. Surtees&#x27;s teammate Lorenzo Bandini took third, after a race-long battle gave him just half a car length advantage over Richie Ginther.

Surtees&#x27;s win in Italy, coupled with Hill and Clark&#x27;s retirements, had suddenly brought him into play for the Drivers&#x27; title and it had put Ferrari on top the Manufacturers&#x27; standings. The season traditionally ended outside of Europe and Watkins Glen hosted the United States Grand Prix for the fourth time. Clark started on pole, ahead of Surtees and Gurney. The Ferrari cars were not painted in traditional red but in white and blue, the national colours of the United States. This was done as a protest concerning arguments between Enzo Ferrari and the Automobile Club d&#x27;Italia regarding the homologation of Ferrari&#x27;s new mid-engined Le Mans race car. The Ferrari cars were entered by the American privateer North American Racing Team. At the start, Clark lost out to Surtees and Lotus teammate Mike Spence, moving up from his sixth place on the grid. Hill had started fourth but, on lap 5, moved past both Spence and Clark, before Clark suddenly found his rhythm and passed all in front to take the lead. It looked like the Brit would run away with the win, but the Climax engine started having trouble picking up fuel. Team boss Colin Chapman called Spence into the pits to switch cars. (Clark would not have scored points in his teammate&#x27;s car but, under the rules of the time, could at least try to push his rivals a place down the order.) However, that car struck mechanical troubles as well. Hill had snatched the lead and stayed there, finishing half a minute ahead of Surtees and a lap ahead of Jo Siffert in a privately run Brabham.

It was the third time in F1 history that the championship was decided at the final race and, for the first time, no less than three drivers and three manufacturers had a chance of winning the respective titles. For Hill (39 points) and Surtees (34), and for their teams Ferrari (43) and BRM (42), winning the race would be enough, no matter the results of others. Clark (30) and his team Lotus (36) had to win and, at the same time, hope that his rivals finished low enough. He started off well, at least, with a pole position, ahead of Gurney and Bandini. Surtees and Hill started fourth and sixth, respectively, and both had a slow getaway off the line. After the first third of the race, Clark was leading comfortably ahead of Gurney, who in turn was more than 10 seconds ahead of Hill, Bandini and Surtees. Hill and Bandini were busy fighting each other and even locked their wheels. Both spun, letting Surtees through and forcing Hill to pit. With eight laps to go, everyone expected Clark to win, until the race turned around like it had done in Belgium. But while Clark had been gifted an unexpected win at Spa, this time it was him that started losing fluids and had to slow right down. Gurney took the lead and scored his second win of the year. Bandini immediately let Surtees through, and the pair sprinted to the line. If Clark had finished ahead of Surtees, then Hill had become champion, but the Ferraris could relax when they saw the Lotus had ground to a halt on the last lap, gifting Surtees his first Formula One World Championship.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, John Surtees (Scuderia Ferrari, 40 points) was awarded the 1964 trophy, ahead of Graham Hill (BRM, 39) and Jim Clark (Lotus, 32). In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Ferrari racked up 45 points, enough for their second title, ahead of BRM (42) and Lotus (37).

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Only the best six results counted towards the championship.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best six results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

* † = Car driven by more than one driver

=== International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings ===

==Non-championship races==
Eight other races which did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers and the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers were held for Formula One cars during the season.

<doc id="1140102" wikidata="Q2012704" url="?curid=1140102" title="Federal funds">
<text>In the United States, federal funds are overnight borrowings between banks and other entities to maintain their bank reserves at the Federal Reserve. Banks keep reserves at Federal Reserve Banks to meet their reserve requirements and to clear financial transactions. Transactions in the federal funds market enable depository institutions with reserve balances in excess of reserve requirements to lend reserves to institutions with reserve deficiencies. These loans are usually made for one day only, that is, &quot;overnight&quot;. The interest rate at which these transactions occur is called the federal funds rate. Federal funds are not collateralized; like eurodollars, they are an unsecured interbank loan.

Federal funds transactions by regulated financial institutions neither increase nor decrease total reserves in the banking system as a whole, instead, they redistribute reserves. Before 2008, this meant that otherwise idle funds could yield a return. (Since 2008, the Fed has paid interest on bank reserves, including excess reserves.) Banks may borrow these funds in order to meet the reserves required to back their deposits. Federal funds are definitive money, meaning that they are available for immediate spending, while checks and many other forms of money must be cleared by banks and typically take several days before becoming available for spending.

Participants in the federal funds market include commercial banks, savings and loan associations, government-sponsored enterprises, branches of foreign banks in the United States, federal agencies, and securities firms. Many relatively small institutions that accumulate reserves in excess of their requirements lend reserves overnight to money centers and large regional banks, as well as to foreign banks operating in the United States. Federal agencies also lend idle funds in the federal funds market.

The Fed, which is the central bank of the United States, conducts monetary policy primarily by targeting a certain value for the federal funds rate. If the Fed wishes to move to, for example, a more expansionary monetary policy, it conducts open market operations, which include primarily bank reserves; since this puts more liquidity into the banking system, it pushes down the federal funds rate.

<doc id="1140103" wikidata="Q69184" url="?curid=1140103" title="1963 Formula One season">
<text>The 1963 Formula One season was the 17th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 14th World Championship of Drivers, the 6th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and numerous non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship was contested over ten races between 26 May and 28 December 1963.

Jim Clark driving for Lotus won his first Drivers&#x27; Championship with three races to go. He won seven races in the championship, a number that would not be beaten until , when Ayrton Senna won eight, and a win percentage that nearly beat Alberto Ascari&#x27;s record from . Lotus also won the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship for the first time.

Every pole position and race in the 1963 championship were won by British drivers, the first time that this was achieved by any single nation. (Italy is sometimes considered to have achieved this feat in , but this only goes if the Indianapolis 500 is excluded from the statistic.)

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1963 FIA World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Dunlop.

===Team and driver changes===
* Porsche withdrew their works team after 1962, choosing to focus on their road-going sports cars. Ex-driver Jo Bonnier signed with Rob Walker&#x27;s private team, while Dan Gurney signed with the relatively new team of double World Champion Jack Brabham. This left only the private Porsche driven by Carel Godin de Beaufort.
* champion Phil Hill and his teammate Giancarlo Baghetti left Scuderia Ferrari after 1962 to go to ATS. The new team was formed by ex-Ferrari employees, including chief engineers Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini, after the &quot;palace revolt&quot; of 1961.
* John Surtees signed with Ferrari in 1963, leaving Reg Parnell to search for new drivers, which he found in veteran Maurice Trintignant and debutant Chris Amon.

====Mid-season changes====
* Ferrari hired Belgian Willy Mairesse and Italian Ludovico Scarfiotti to share the role of teammate to John Surtees. Mairesse suffered a heavy crash in the German Grand Prix and broke his arm. Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini was brought in to finish the season.
* Lotus driver Trevor Taylor crashed out of the (non-championship) 1963 Mediterranean Grand Prix at Enna-Pergusa. He was thrown out of his car, which then caught fire. He escaped with fairly minor injuries but missed the Italian Grand Prix. Mike Spence substituted for him.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Dutch Grand Prix was organised a month later than in 1962, moving it back to be the third race in the championship.
* The French Grand Prix was moved back to Reims-Gueux. It would alternate to host the GP with Rouen-Les-Essarts until .
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Aintree to Silverstone. Aintree had alternated with Silverstone since , but 1962 was the last time that they hosted F1.
* The Mexican Grand Prix was added to the calendar and was held at the Magdalena Mixhuca circuit in Mexico City.

==Championship report==

===Rounds 1 to 3===
The Monaco Grand Prix received the honorary title of &quot;European Grand Prix&quot; and, more importantly, functioned as the 1963 season opener. With little driver changes in the front-running teams and constructors withholding to introduce new designs to the narrow streets of Monte Carlo, the battle between the championship protagonists was expected to restart. Only five drivers were guaranteed a starting place: the previous World Champions or winners of the Monaco Grand Prix. The rest had to fight in qualifying over the remaining eleven spaces. 1962&#x27;s runner-up Jim Clark managed this with ease in his Lotus-Climax. He posted the fastest practice time and started the race on pole position. Reigning champion Graham Hill started second in his BRM, while John Surtees (Ferrari) and Richie Ginther (BRM). Hill and Ginther took the lead at the start, but the first nine cars kept going nose-to-tail. Clark managed to get past Hill on lap 7, but then went wide at the Station hairpin and going down to third once again. He tried again and the lead changes hands multiple times, before Clark went ahead definitively and increased his lead to 17 seconds at three-quarters race-distance. Then suddenly, his gearbox jammed and his wheels locked. Hill was gifted the win, ahead of teammate Ginther and Bruce McLaren in the Cooper.

The Belgian Grand Prix was run at Spa-Francorchamps, one of the fastest circuits of the year, with the 1.5 litre cars running full throttle for some three minutes per lap. Clark was still suffering from gearbox issues, so Hill took pole position, ahead of Dan Gurney (Brabham) and local hero Willy Mairesse (Ferrari). Clark started eighth, but somehow, managed to take the lead before the first corner was reached. Hill followed him and the pair had a 15-second lead after the first lap. The race was run in very wet conditions and Clark had the upper-hand, stretching out a lead of his own to almost 30 seconds at half-distance. Then when Hill&#x27;s gearbox broke, his win looked sealed, expect the heaviest storm of the day flooded the track. Five drivers crashed and it was discussed to stop the race, but Clark cautiously completed the laps, ahead of McLaren and Gurney.
Moving north some , Circuit Zandvoort hosted the Dutch Grand Prix. Clark started on pole, ahead of Hill and McLaren. The three arrived side-by-side at Tarzan corner, but the positions were unchanged. Brabham had started fourth but got up to second while his teammate Gurney drew everyone&#x27;s attention with a heroic recovery drive after a bad start. Hill got back up to second, but his BRM was overheating. Gurney had climbed to fourth, but a strut underneath the car had come loose and a pit stop brought him back down the order. Hill&#x27;s engine had enough on lap 58 and he was forced to pit, letting Surtees into second and Gurney up to third. The latter had been working wonders again, but Clark, meanwhile, was a lap ahead of everyone else. He won the race to make it a &quot;grand slam&quot;, ahead of Gurney and Surtees, a late spin by the Ferrari driver gave Gurney a deserved place as &#x27;best-of-the-rest&#x27;.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jim Clark (Lotus) was leading with 18 points, ahead of Richie Ginther (BRM with 11 and Bruce McLaren (Cooper) and Dan Gurney (Brabham), both with 10. Lotus was leading the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship with 19 points, ahead of BRM with 14 and Cooper and Brabham with 10.

===Rounds 4 to 7===
Championship leader Jim Clark scored another pole position at the French Grand Prix, ahead of Graham Hill and Dan Gurney. At the start, Hill stalled his engine, along with Masten Gregory and the unrelated Phil Hill, but they were allowed to be push-started without further consequence, which was a diversion from the normal rules by the French race director. Behind Clark, a group of Brabhams and BRMs were fighting over second place. A couple of laps later, a series of retirements had changed the picture, and Clark&#x27;s engine was not reaching full rpm either. Jack Brabham was catching the leading Lotus, but when the rain fell, Clark was again the fastest man on track and took the chequered flag to complete another &quot;grand slam&quot; and a hattrick of wins. When an electrical wire had come loose, Brabham&#x27;s engine died. Although he could restart it, second place was now up for grabs. Hill took first advantage but his clutch slipped and it was Tony Maggs for Cooper that was the first to finish behind the almighty Clark. During the race, the stewards decided to penalise the three drivers that stalled on the grid by adding a minute to their race time. Hill was still classified as third, but at a later point, it was decided to withhold his championship points. No points were awarded for third place.

For the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Clark scored a fourth consecutive pole position, ahead of Gurney and Hill. Clark bogged down at the start, but he was back in front after just four laps. Brabham was the first of a group tightly fighting over second place. Gurney took over when Brabham&#x27;s engine blew up. The race went on without incidents until Gurney&#x27;s engine blew up on lap 60 and spread oil across the track. Hill went into second place before he starting running out of fuel, letting Surtees into second and coasting over the line in third place. Clark scored his fourth win in a row.

Clark looked unstoppable going into the German Grand Prix, putting his Lotus on pole once again, ahead of Surtees and Bandini (BRM). Clark held the lead at the start and was expected to run away with it, but sixth-starting Richie Ginther overtook him and so did Surtees, later in the first lap. Surtees and Clark soon passed Ginther, but still, it was a Ferrari in front and not a Lotus. And that remained for a while, with Clark going faster through the corners, but his Climax engine cutting out a cylinder, slowing him down on the straights. Graham Hill retired with a failing gearbox. When Surtees set a new lap record, Clark eased off to at least ensure a second place. Surtees delivered Ferrari&#x27;s first win in two years. Ginther finished third. There were multiple heavy crashes during the race: Surtees&#x27;s teamamte Willy Mairesse came off worst with a broken arm.

Clark was now 20 points ahead in the championship, and he would clinch the title if he won the Italian Grand Prix, no matter the results of his rivals. Unlike in , the organisers had planned to use the full Monza circuit, including the oval. Bob Anderson crashed his Lola in practice and described it the safest accident he could wish to have. However, the police went round the track and noted that there were no fences on the inside of the oval to protect spectators. The organisers quickly agreed, seeing that there was a petition going to refuse the race unless the banking was eliminated, and declared to use the road circuit only for the rest of the weekend. Surtees qualified on pole in front of Ferrari&#x27;s home crowd, ahead of Hill and Clark. Hill got the best start and was followed by Clark, before the traditional slipstreaming commenced and the lead changes hands multiple times through the next laps. Soon, though, Surtees and Clark were on their own, and then the Ferrari engine blew up. This gifted Clark the lead, but without a slipstream, the Climax engine was not up for it, so Hill and Gurney caught him and they formed a new trio at the front. But Hill&#x27;s clutch gave out just after half-distance and Gurney&#x27;s BRM had trouble with its fuel system, so Clark was left alone once more and his pace dropped. By this point, however, he was a lap ahead of second-placed Ginther and he cruised to the finish, to take the win and claim the 1963 championship.

Jim Clark (Lotus) led the championship with 51 points, ahead of Richie Ginther (BRM, 24) and John Surtees (Ferrari, 22). On the basis of points, Ginther could still get level with Clark, but only the six best results in the season would count towards the championship, so on the minute chance that he would win the last three races, a number of third and second-place finishes would be discounted. It marked Clark&#x27;s and Lotus&#x27;s first titles, and it was the first time that a driver secured the title with three races to go. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Lotus stood on 51 points, ahead of BRM (28) and Ferrari (22).

===Rounds 8 to 10===
Even with the title in the pocket, Jim Clark was not easing off and fought for pole position for the United States Grand Prix, but it was champion Graham Hill that snatched it by a tenth of a second. His rivals in the hunt for second position in the championship, John Surtees and Richie Ginther, started on the second row. At the start, Clark&#x27;s engine stalled, so Hill was unchallenged into the first corner. The Lotus was pushed to life and the freshly crowned champion started his race over a lap down. On lap 7, Surtees took the lead from Hill and Dan Gurney took third place from Ginther. Hill followed the Ferrari but had had enough of it by lap 30. He tried to overtake twice, but both times, Surtees repassed him on the straight. By lap 80, Hill was falling back with handling problems, but Surtees came into the pits with a failing engine. The BRMs of Hill and Ginther finished 1–2, ahead of Clark in third, whose engine was misfiring but had seen more than ten other drivers retiring.

Clark was back on top for the Mexican Grand Prix, he started ahead of Surtees and Hill. Ginther, second in the championship standings, started fifth. At the start, Hill missed a gear and moved down to eighth. Fourth-starting Gurney moved up to second. Surtees pitted on lap 19 and was disqualified for needing a push-start from his mechanics. Double World Champion Jack Brabham inherited third place and managed to get past Ginther. Clark finished an lonely race at the top, almost a lap ahead of Brabham and Ginther. Hill finished fourth.

Going into the final race, the South African Grand Prix, Ginther (29 points), Hill (25) and Surtees (22) could all still finish runner-up in the championship. The deal would be done if one of them could beat Clark to victory, but the champion started on pole position. Surtees started fourth, was up to second at the end of the first lap, but was back to fourth on lap 5. He suddenly retired on lap 43 when his engine blew up. Brabham had started second but fell back with a loss of power, while teammate Gurney was running a comfortable second, actually keeping up with Clark but not able to do more than that. Ginther&#x27;s driveshaft failed on lap 44, letting Hill into third place and gifting the Brit second place in the championship.

The Drivers&#x27; Championship ended with Jim Clark (Lotus) on 54 points, winning his first title, ahead of BRM teammates Graham Hill and Richie Ginther, both scoring 29 points, but the Brit getting second place on countback. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Lotus gathered 54 points, winning their first title as well, ahead of BRM with 36 and Brabham with 28.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Only the best six results counted towards the championship.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best six results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===
* &quot;Italics&quot; indicate fastest lap
* Bold indicates pole position
‡ No points awarded as Hill&#x27;s car was pushed at the start line.

=== International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings ===


*Bold results counted to championship totals.
‡ No points awarded as Hill&#x27;s car was pushed at the start line.
==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One races, which did not count towards the World Championship, were also held in 1963.

<text>The 1962 Formula One season was the 16th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 13th World Championship of Drivers, the 5th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and numerous non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship was contested over nine races between 20 May and 29 December 1962.

Graham Hill driving for BRM won his first Drivers&#x27; Championship when rival Jim Clark retired from the last race. BRM also won the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship for the first time, and it would be the only time.

Double World Champion Jack Brabham formed his own team and debuted the Brabham BT3 in the United States Grand Prix, becoming the first ever F1 driver to score championship points in a car bearing his own name.

Ricardo Rodríguez suffered a fatal crash during practice for his home race, the non-championship Mexican Grand Prix. He had been the youngest ever driver for Scuderia Ferrari, but also became the youngest ever F1 driver to die.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1962 FIA World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Dunlop.

===Team and driver changes===
* Like in , Ferrari entered most races with three cars. Stirling Moss was due to drive for them, but suffered an accident during the non-championship Glover Trophy. He went into a coma for a month and the left side of his body was paralysed for six months. Giancarlo Baghetti was granted the seat, having proven himself worthy by winning the 1961 French Grand Prix and multiple non-championship races in a privately run Ferrari.
* Richie Ginther moved from Ferrari to BRM, where Tony Brooks had retired. The team introduced their own V8 engine for this season, after they had had to rely on Climax engines the year before.
* Lotus hired Taylor after Innes Ireland was fired and went to the BRP team (renamed &quot;UDT Laystall Racing&quot;).
* Double World Champion Jack Brabham started his own team, Brabham, at first running a Lotus chassis but later debuting the BT3, with which he became the first F1 driver ever to score points in a car bearing his own name. Tony Maggs replaced him at Cooper.
* Bowmaker Racing (what would later become Reg Parnell Racing) entered the season with a Lola Mk4, the first ever F1 chassis by Lola Cars.

====Mid-season changes====
* Lorenzo Bandini and Willy Mairesse joined Scuderia Ferrari on a part-time basis, expanding the squad to five cars for the Italian Grand Prix.
* After a brief appearance in , Emeryson was back on the grid as a works team. They ran a Lotus chassis once before debuting a self-designed car in the British Grand Prix.
* The ENB team debuted a self-made chassis in the German Grand Prix, powered by a Maserati engine.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Monaco Grand Prix was moved back three weeks, making the Dutch Grand Prix the season opener.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Reims-Gueux to Rouen-Les-Essarts for a year, as it was the tradition to do every five years (after and ).
* The South African Grand Prix made its debut on the championship calendar. The race was held at the Prince George Circuit as the season finale on 29 December.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 3===

The Dutch Grand Prix hosted the season opener for the first time and was granted the honorary designation of &quot;European Grand Prix&quot; for this year. Lotus turned up with a revolutionary new chassis, the Lotus 25 being the first car built around an aluminium monocoque instead of a space frame. However, it was John Surtees who took pole position in the privately run Lola, ahead of Graham Hill for BRM. Lotus&#x27;s Jim Clark qualified third, but this meant he had the inside line to the first corner and he managed to take the lead. Dan Gurney in the Porsche had a wonderful start from eighth to take third behind Hill and ahead of Surtees. The top three were steady in the opening phase, but then, both Clark and Gurney ran into technical troubles. Around the same time, the front wishbone broke on Surtees&#x27;s Lola and he had a heavy crash but escaped unhurt. Graham Hill led away and scored the victory. Bruce McLaren (Cooper) was running second before he retired with a broken gearbox. Reigning champion Phil Hill (Ferrari) was running third at the time, inheritering second but later getting overtaken by Trevor Taylor (Lotus).

Jim Clark scored his first career pole in the Monaco Grand Prix, ahead of Graham Hill and Bruce McLaren. But due to a confusing start procedure, it was Willy Mairesse in the Ferrari who went by, touching wheels with Clark and Hill in the process and locking up his wheels into the first corner. A chain reaction led to an accident with six drivers, three of whom retired on the spot. Mairesse took the lead but spun his car in the second hairpin, making the order at the end of the first lap: McLaren, Graham Hill, Phil Hill. McLaren was relegated back to second by lap 7, and then third by Clark, who was recovering from a bad start, was setting multiple fastest laps and started challenging Hill for the lead. On lap 55, however, his clutch gave out and he had to retire. But Hill was not yet out of the woods, with his BRM engine starting to smoke and McLaren, back in second, getting ever closer. On lap 93, Hill&#x27;s engine gave up with a bang, although he still scored a point, as he was classified in sixth. McLaren was challenged by Phil Hill but held on to score his first win in two years. Lorenzo Bandini finished third in his first race for Ferrari.

The Belgian Grand Prix saw Graham Hill qualify on pole, ahead of McLaren, Taylor and home hero Mairesse. In the first phase of the race, those four were fighting over the lead in close combat and their relative positions changed all the while. Clark had started in twelfth, but joined the leading group. On lap 11, Clark set the fastest lap and took the lead, with teammate Taylor holding back their rivals. Clark held on to take the win, but getting up to the final corner of lap 26, Taylor crashed with Mairesse, the Lotus cutting down a telegraph pole and the Ferrari landing upside down on fire. Both drivers were flung out and suffered minor injuries. Graham Hill finished second, Phil Hill third. Ricardo Rodríguez came home in fourth, becoming the youngest F1 driver ever to score points. This record stood until Jenson Button broke it in the 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Graham Hill (BRM) was leading with 16 points, ahead of champion Phil Hill (Ferrari) with 14 and Jim Clark (Lotus) with 9. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, BRM went ahead with 16 points, ahead of Lotus (15) and Ferrari (14).

===Rounds 4 to 6===
The French Grand Prix saw Jim Clark qualify on pole position in his Lotus, ahead of championship leader Graham Hill for BRM and Bruce McLaren for Cooper. Although Ferrari had withdrawn from the event due to strike actions, the first three rows were occupied by seven different teams and five different constructors. Fifth-starting John Surtees was in second after the first lap and challenged Hill for the lead, but had to pit when his engine had trouble picking up fuel. Jackie Lewis was lapped by Hill but then suddenly lost his brakes and rear-ended the leader. Clark took the lead, but was caught by Hill within three laps, confirming to the Lotus team that their car was not running well, and they decided to retire from the race. Further drama ensued when Hill&#x27;s BRM engine had jammed with ten laps to go, paving the way for Dan Gurney taking his first and Porsche&#x27;s only win. South African Tony Maggs was second for Cooper, scoring his first podium, and Richie Ginther third for BRM.

During the British Grand Prix, Clark scored his third pole position of the year, this time ahead of Surtees and Ireland. The latter, however, could not get his Lotus to fire up and was passed at by everyone at the start. McLaren took over third place. The top three remained unchanged throughout the race, with Clark taking an unchallenged win and even getting close to lapping championship leader Hill, who came home in fourth.
The German Grand Prix saw the debut of Brabham&#x27;s first F1 chassis, designed by Ron Tauranac. Scuderia Ferrari, having recovered from strikes in Italy, brought an upgraded chassis and gave it to Lorenzo Bandini to try it out. During practice, Carel Godin de Beaufort was running his Porsche with a large camera mounted to the rear by the German television crew. The device fell off, however, and championship leader Hill was the unlucky victim, unable to avoid it, breaking his oil lines and quickly spinning off the track. Tony Maggs then slid on Hill&#x27;s oil and had a similar accident, but both drivers were unhurt. Gurney started on pole, ahead of Hill and Clark, but the race was delayed for over an hour, after a sudden downpour made the track incredibly slippery. When the race got underway, Clark stalled his engine and fell back, but he passed 17 cars on the first lap. The leading pair went side-by-side as they started the third lap and it was Hill who came out on top. Surtees had inherited third place from Clark and this top three got away from the rest. Surtees got second place when Gurney&#x27;s battery came loose and the American had to secure by hand. At half-distance, Clark had recovered to fourth place, mastering the wet conditions and gaining at least five seconds per lap on the leading trio. After almost losing the car twice at high speed, however, the Scot settled down. Surtees tried to push Hill into making a mistake but the Brit held on, taking the win, with Surtees and Gurney finishing within the next five seconds.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Graham Hill (BRM) was still holding onto the lead with 28 points, ahead of Jim Clark (Lotus) with 21 and John Surtees (Lola) with 19. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, BRM were leading with 31, ahead of Lotus (27) and Cooper (23).

===Rounds 7 to 9===

The Italian Grand Prix was run on the &quot;road circuit&quot; of Monza, abandoning the fearsome banked oval. Jim Clark, second in the championship, qualified on pole position, ahead of championship leader Graham Hill and his teammate Richie Ginther. Hill took the lead at the start and led a group eight cars. Ferrari had brought five cars to their home race but they were all down in the second group. Clark pitted with transmission problems, while Hill managed to create some space between him and the rest. BRM scored a comfortable 1–2, while close fighting and a light rain shower provided exciting battles, from which Bruce McLaren came up to complete the podium.

F1 moved overseas for the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. In repeat of this year&#x27;s French GP and last year&#x27;s US GP, Ferrari withdrew from this race and the next because of ongoing strikes in Italy. Clark qualified on pole, ahead of Ginther and Hill, and the Lotus was fastest at the start. Hill went into second, trying everything to stay with his rival. This paid off on lap 12, when Clark was held up by a backmarker and Hill swooped by. On lap 19, however, Clark snatched the lead back and held on to take the win, ten seconds ahead of Hill. The rest of the field, all at least a lap down, were led by third-placed McLaren.

Coming to the season finale, the South African Grand Prix, Clark had a nine-point deficit to Hill. If Clark would manage to win the race, then Hill could finish second at best, which meant that his result would not count - only the five best results of the season counted towards the championship. This would result in a tie on points, and Clark would win the title on countback - he would have four wins against Hill&#x27;s three.

Clark started off well, scoring his sixth pole position of the season, with Hill starting alongside him. He held the lead at the start and then pulled away by a second per lap. He had an immense lead of half a minute when, suddenly, blue smoke started pouring from his engine. After stopping in the pits, it was found that a bolt was missing from the crankcase, which had allowed oil to leak out. The smoke was caused by the oil leaking on the exhaust. The Lotus mechanics did not have a fix, which meant Clark had to retire and give up the championship. Hill could cruise to the finish but still won the race almost 50 seconds ahead of McLaren and home hero Tony Maggs.

The Drivers&#x27; Championship was settled with Graham Hill (BRM) on 42 points, winning his first title, ahead of Jim Clark (Lotus) on 30 and Bruce McLaren (Cooper) on 27. The Manufacturers&#x27; Championship was won by BRM with 42 points, ahead of Lotus (36) and Cooper (29).

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Only the best five results counted towards the championship.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best five results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

* Only the best 5 results counted towards the championship. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored.
* &quot;Italics&quot; indicate fastest lap 
* Bold indicates pole position

=== International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings ===

* Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored.
*Bold results counted to championship totals.

==Non-championship races==
The following Formula One races which did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers or the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, were also held in 1962.

<doc id="1140105" wikidata="Q69161" url="?curid=1140105" title="1961 Formula One season">
<text>The 1961 Formula One season was the 15th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 12th World Championship of Drivers, the 4th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and numerous non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship was contested over eight races between 14 May and 8 October 1961.

Phil Hill driving for Ferrari won his first and only Drivers&#x27; Championship after his teammate and rival Wolfgang von Trips was killed during the Italian Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season. Hill was the first American-born champion (and, so far, the only one, because champion Mario Andretti was born in Italy). Ferrari won its first Manufacturers&#x27; Championship.

New regulations only allowed naturally aspirated engines with a maximum capacity of , effectively adopting the Formula Two engine rules as used from 1957 to 1960. The English teams threatened to boycott, because the change was communicated only shortly before the season started, but the protests subsided. Although Enzo Ferrari was opposed as well, the manufacturer got it right by designing their first mid-engined car, the legendary 156 &quot;Sharknose&quot;, and won five out of the eight championship races.

Besides Wolfgang von Trips, two other F1 drivers died this year: Italian Giulio Cabianca during a test at the Modena Autodrome and Briton Shane Summers during the non-championship Silver City Trophy.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1961 FIA World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Dunlop.

===Team and driver changes===

* Porsche made their full-season debut, entering two cars driven by Jo Bonnier and Dan Gurney.
* Both of them had been driving for BRM, so the British signed Tony Brooks to partner future champion Graham Hill. BRM had been building their own engines in previous years but were not prepared for this year&#x27;s rule changes, so they bought a Coventry Climax unit. It was the same engine as Team Lotus and Cooper were using, but results were merely reasonable.
* John Surtees moved from Lotus&#x27;s works team to Reg Parnell&#x27;s private entry to fill the seat of Brooks. Lotus did not replace Surtees and reduced their operations to two cars.
* Both Aston Martin and Vanwall had only competed in one race in and abandoned their F1 operations before this year.
* Maserati had withdrawn their works team after 1958, but private teams had still been using their legendary 250F chassis from 1948. From this year on, however, Maserati would only be supplying engines.

====Mid-season changes====
* Lotus driver Innes Ireland was badly injured in the Monaco Grand Prix, so Trevor Taylor filled in for him during the Dutch Grand Prix. Taylor would be hired instead of Ireland for the 1962 season.
* After getting injured in a crash in last year&#x27;s Monaco Grand Prix, BRP driver Cliff Allison was taken to hospital again after practice for the Belgian Grand Prix. He broke both his knees and fractured his pelvis when his car careened off the course and overturned in a field. His seat was filled by Lucien Bianchi and Masten Gregory. Their teammate Henry Taylor suffered a serious accident in the British Grand Prix, after which he turned away from single-seater racing and took up rallying. He was replaced by Olivier Gendebien.
* Ferrari driver Wolfgang von Trips collided with Jim Clark during the Italian Grand Prix. His car went off the track, fatally throwing him out and killing fifteen spectators. Ferrari withdrew the team from the final race on the calendar, but still won both championships.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Moroccan Grand Prix was originally scheduled to be held on 29 October as the season finale but was cancelled for the third year in a row due to monetary reasons.
* The Argentine Grand Prix was dropped from the calendar after the Argentinian fan base declined with the retirements of Juan Manuel Fangio in 1958 and José Froilán González in 1960, and the unstable government situation (since the exile of then President of Argentina Juan Peron in 1955) caused safety concerns.
* The Portuguese Grand Prix was dropped from the calendar.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Aintree, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.
* The German Grand Prix returned to the Nürburgring after the 1959 round was run at the AVUS circuit and the 1960 round was run as a Formula Two race.
* Six weeks before the race, it was decided the United States Grand Prix would move from Riverside International Raceway to Watkins Glen because of the lack of spectators attending and prize money being paid by the latter&#x27;s organisers.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
Formula One effectively adopted the Formula Two engine regulations, as used from 1957 to 1960, by reducing the maximum engine capacity to and only allowing naturally aspirated engines. Furthermore:
* The minimum capacity was set at .
* The minimum weight was originally set at , but later lowered to .
* It was banned to add lubricants (oil or water) to a car during a race;
* Wheels could not be covered by bodywork.

===Safety regulations===
Numerous technical innovations were made mandatory from the aspect of safety:
* Roll bars, which had to be wider than the driver&#x27;s shoulders but could not extend higher or further forward than the driver&#x27;s head;
* Automatic starter motors capable of being operated by the driver when seated at the steering wheel;
* An electrical master switch as fire precaution;
* A dual braking system with independent operation on the front wheels, so in case of a brake fail, the front brakes will still slow the car down;
* Seat belt attachments (although wearing the belt remained optional);
* Fuel tank fillers could not stick out of the body panels and had to be wide enough for air to espace during refueling.

===Sporting regulations===
The number of championship points awarded to a race winner was increased to nine.

==Championship report==
===Pre-season non-championship races===
Before the 1961 Formula One season was to start in Monaco in mid-May, many non-championship races were held throughout Europe. The first was the Lombank Trophy, a joint Formula One and Intercontinental Formula race, at the fast 2.7-mile Snetterton circuit in eastern England. Most of the top drivers of the day, such as Stirling Moss, Jim Clark, Graham Hill, Phil Hill and Wolfgang von Trips were in the United States competing in the prestigious 12 Hours of Sebring sportscar race. Still, two top drivers—John Surtees and defending champion Jack Brabham—were in attendance. Brabham won the race in an Intercontinental Cooper while Surtees finished third, first of the Formula One entrants.

A week later, the Glover Trophy at the fast Goodwood circuit in southern England was held, with Surtees winning in a privately entered Cooper, ahead of Graham Hill in a works BRM, Surtees&#x27;s teammate Roy Salvadori in a Cooper and Moss in a Rob Walker-entered Lotus. On the same day, the Pau Grand Prix in southwest France was won by Clark driving a works Lotus. Six days later, the Brussels Grand Prix at Heysel Park was won by Brabham in a works Cooper. Seven days after that, Moss won the Vienna Grand Prix in Austria, held at an aerodrome in Aspern, Vienna. Six days later, on a Friday, the Aintree 200 in Liverpool was won by Brabham in wet conditions, and three days later, the prestigious Syracuse Grand Prix in Sicily was won by Giancarlo Baghetti in a Ferrari – his first ever Formula One race.

===Race 1: Monaco===

The 1961 Formula One season did not officially start until May, eight days after the BRDC race in England. Practice saw Clark crash his Lotus heavily at turn one, and Lotus&#x27;s woes continued when Innes Ireland crashed in the tunnel during the final session, destroying his car and breaking his leg. Moss took pole in his Rob Walker Lotus with Richie Ginther&#x27;s Ferrari and Clark&#x27;s Lotus sharing the front row. Graham and Phil Hill shared the second row. This particular Monaco Grand Prix turned out to be a classic, with one of the greatest driving performances in the history of Formula One by Stirling Moss in a privately entered Lotus against three Ferraris with a lot more power but worse handling than the Lotus.

At the start, Ginther took the lead from Clark and Moss, but Clark soon had to pit with fuel pump problems, and so Jo Bonnier and Dan Gurney took third and fourth in their Porsches. On Lap 14, both Moss and Bonnier were able to pass Ginther, and 10 laps later Phil Hill passed both Ginther and Bonnier to move into second but there was no way he was going to catch Moss, who was driving one of the greatest races of his illustrious career. Towards mid-distance Ginther fought back, passing Hill for second and chasing after Moss, closing the gap to just three seconds. Moss responded, driving on the limit the entire way and eventually won the race. Hill finished third and Wolfgang von Trips was classified fourth despite crashing on the last lap.

The 19th Naples Grand Prix in southern Italy, held on the same day as the Monaco Grand Prix, at the Posillipo Park circuit and it was won by Baghetti- who had won two Formula One races from two starts.

===Race 2: Netherlands===

There were just eight days between Monaco and the Dutch Grands Prix. The Dutch race was held at the Circuit Zandvoort located in small sand dunes right next to a popular beach 20 miles west of Amsterdam. The injured Innes Ireland was replaced at Team Lotus by Trevor Taylor but otherwise the field was much as it had been at Monaco, with local hero Carel Godin de Beaufort getting a drive in one of the Porsches, entered by his Ecurie Maarsbergen. Ferrari monopolised the front row of the grid with Phil Hill on pole from von Trips and Ginther, while Moss&#x27;s Walker Lotus and Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM shared the second row.

At the start, von Trips took the lead with Graham Hill in a works BRM and Phil Hill behind him. Graham Hill soon began to fall back, dropping quickly behind Phil Hill and Clark, who had stormed through the field from the fourth row to run fourth at the end of the first lap. Clark proceeded to battle for second place with the Ferrari and they exchanged places several times before Phil Hill finally asserted himself. Further back Graham Hill battled with Moss and Ginther, but it was von Trips who emerged ahead for most of the race, and won it. On the last lap, however, Ginther went wide when his throttle stuck open and Moss was able to grab fourth.

The 1961 Dutch Grand Prix has a remarkable place in F1 history: every starter finished the race and no-one went into the pits. Such reliability has never been achieved since, made even more remarkable by the fact that Formula One cars were far from reliable machines during a race.

The London Trophy was held at the short, tight and twisty Crystal Palace circuit in London the day after the Dutch Grand Prix, and it was won by Salvadori driving a Yeoman Credit Cooper, whilst another English race, the Silver City Trophy at the undulating and twisty Brands Hatch circuit nearby Crystal Palace was held in wet conditions and was won by Moss in a Walker Lotus, but was marred by the death of 24-year-old Welshman Shane Summers in a Cooper, who was killed almost instantly when he spun at the challenging, anti-cambered Paddock Hill Bend, went off and crashed into a concrete wall near an underground tunnel entrance.

===Race 3: Belgium===

A year after the traumatic 1960 Belgian Grand Prix, the F1 teams gathered again at the very fast and frighteningly daunting 8.7 mile Spa-Francorchamps public road circuit near Liège with a few changes from the Dutch Grand Prix three weeks previously. Innes Ireland, who had broken his leg at Monaco, was back in action for Team Lotus, which had new Lotus 21s for Ireland and Jim Clark. Ferrari had a fourth car painted up in Belgian racing yellow for Olivier Gendebien, which was being run by Ecurie Nationale Belge, which also had a pair of Emeryson chassis for Lucien Bianchi and Willy Mairesse. These were both damaged in practice and so Bianchi and Mairesse took over the non-qualified Lotus 18&#x27;s with Tony Marsh and Wolfgang Seidel. British Racing Partnership was also in trouble with only one Lotus 18 to be shared by Cliff Allison and Henry Taylor. The team decided that the fastest driver would race, and as a result Allison went too fast, crashed heavily at Blanchimont, rolled the car and suffered severe leg injuries which would end his F1 career.

Phil Hill took pole with von Trips alongside while Gendebien made the most of his local experience to take third despite using a less powerful engine than the factory Ferraris. Ginther&#x27;s Ferrari shared the second row with Surtees in Reg Parnell&#x27;s Cooper-Climax.

Phil Hill took the lead at the start but was then passed by Gendebien while von Trips and Ginther joined in. The four Ferrari cars, well suited to this power circuit thanks to the formidable performance of their 120-degree V6 engines dominated the race and the lead changed several times before Phil Hill took the lead from von Trips and Ginther. Gendebien was fourth giving Ferrari a straight 1-2-3-4 result. Phil Hill fought von Trips all the way and the Phil Hill finished 0.7 seconds ahead of von Trips. Surtees was fifth although he had to battle early in the race with Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM which eventually went out with electrical trouble. Gurney finished sixth in his Porsche.

===Race 4: France===

A fortnight after the Belgian GP the F1 teams gathered at the very fast, straight dominated Reims public road circuit for the French Grand Prix in Champagne country. As the French did not bother with the restrictive invitations it was a large field of cars with a variety of unusual privateers. Ferrari had a fourth car, run in the colors of the Federazione Italiana Scuderie Automobilische and driven by Baghetti who arrived at Reims undefeated. There was a new De Tomaso-Osca which was run by Scuderia Serenissima for Giorgio Scarlatti but it was not competitive. It was an all-Ferrari front row with Phil Hill on pole from Wolfgang Von Trips and Ritchie Ginther with the second row being shared by Stirling Moss in his Rob Walker Lotus 18 and Jim Clark in one of the factory Lotus 21s.

The race weekend was held in extremely hot conditions, and the track began to break up at the track&#x27;s 2 hairpins. The ambient temperature on Sunday/race day was 102 °F (39 °C), and the race turned out to be yet another classic. Hill led from the start with Ginther and Von Trips giving chase but when Ginther spun Moss was able to take third for a while before the American recovered. Further back, there was an exciting slipstreaming battle between seven cars: the two Porsches of Dan Gurney and Jo Bonnier, the factory Lotuses of Clark and Ireland, Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM (Tony Brooks went out early in the other car with engine trouble), Bruce McLaren&#x27;s Cooper and the fourth Ferrari of Baghetti. Eventually Ginther passed Moss and he dropped back into this fight because of brake trouble. Then the Ferrari team faltered. Von Trips, who had taken the lead under team orders, stopped with engine trouble on lap 18. Hill took over but spun on lap 38 and stalled his engine, re-joining a lap behind. Ginther lasted only three laps in the lead before he stopped with an engine problem and suddenly the seething battle for fourth place was a fight for the lead. Gradually the challengers dropped away leaving Gurney&#x27;s Porsche against Baghetti&#x27;s Ferrari. They changed places lap after lap and on the final lap Baghetti dived out of Gurney&#x27;s slipstream to pass the American a couple of hundred yards before the finish line. Baghetti thus became the first and, to date, only man to win his first World Championship event.

===Race 5: Britain===
Thirteen days later the British Grand Prix was held at the Aintree circuit in Liverpool, site of England&#x27;s Grand National horse race. The field at Aintree was not very different from that which had been seen at Reims, although Rob Walker ran a four-wheel-drive Ferguson for Jack Fairman, although this was also driven by Stirling Moss during practice. There were four Ferraris again, with the unbeaten Giancarlo Baghetti joining the works trio. Qualifying saw Phil Hill, Ritchie Ginther, Jo Bonnier (Porsche) and Wolfgang Von Trips all set identical lap times, while Moss was alongside Von Trips on the second row in his Walker Lotus 18.

The race began in heavy rain with Phil Hill, Von Trips and Ginther getting ahead at the start, chased by Moss and Bonnier. Von Trips took the lead after seven laps, passing Hill. Moss moved to third when Ginther ran wide at one point and then managed to get past Hill for second. He chased Von Trips but was never able to pass him. When the rain stopped Moss began to drop back and would retire with brake problems. This allowed the Ferraris to finish 1-2-3 with Von Trips winning over Hill and Ginther. Jack Brabham, Bonnier and Roy Salvadori (Reg Parnell Cooper) completed the top six. The unbeaten Baghetti crashed out early in the race. Moss took over Fairman&#x27;s Ferguson after he had retired but was eventually called into the pits and disqualified for having received a push-start.

The Solitude Grand Prix in Germany was held a week after the British Grand Prix on the very demanding and dangerous seven mile Solitude circuit near Porsche and Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s hometown of Stuttgart. This race was won by Briton Innes Ireland in a works Lotus.

===Race 6: Germany===
The German Grand Prix, held at the fearsome, twisty, very dangerous and extremely challenging 14.2 mile Nürburgring circuit for the first time since 1958 featured a huge field of cars with Ferrari turning up with four cars, Wolfgang Von Trips, Phil Hill and Ritchie Ginther being joined by Willy Mairesse, although the Belgian had an older engine in his car. Jack Brabham had the new Climax V8 FWMV engine for the first time in his factory Cooper, while Porsche had four cars, Edgar Barth joining Jo Bonnier, Dan Gurney and Hans Herrmann. Qualifying saw Hill record a remarkable lap of 8:55.2 – the first time anyone had lapped the Nordschleife in under nine minutes. This time which was nearly six seconds faster than Brabham&#x27;s best, with Moss third quickest in his Rob Walker Lotus 18. Bonnier completed the front row in his Porsche. The second row featured Von Trips, Graham Hill in his BRM and Gurney.

The race started in damp conditions and Brabham led the field away only to spin out and crash on that first lap. Phil Hill charged up and took the lead, but Moss passed the American before they reached the finish line to start the second lap. Moss would stay ahead for the rest of the race while Von Trips came up and overtook Hill for second after a long battle. Towards the end of the race it started to rain, but Moss never took off his intermediate tires, and this allowed Moss to extend his lead, and won a superb victory with a Lotus that had superior handling to the Ferrari – essential at the Nürburgring.

There was a three-week break between the German Grand Prix and the Swedish Kanonloppet, a non-championship race near Stockholm, and a week after that, the Danish Grand Prix at Roskilde near Copenhagen and a week after that the Modena Grand Prix near Ferrari&#x27;s headquarters was held and all three of these races were won by Moss in the Walker Lotus.

===Race 7: Italy===
The penultimate race of the 1961 World Championship was to be a showdown between two Ferrari drivers. The team had already won the Constructors&#x27; title so it was a straight fight between Wolfgang Von Trips and Phil Hill for the Drivers&#x27; title although Moss still had a mathematical chance of victory if he won both races. The advantage lay with Wolfgang Von Trips who had 33 points to Phil Hill&#x27;s 29. The Ferrari team had a new recruit at the Monza Autodrome near Milan, 19-year old Mexican Ricardo Rodriguez taking over the team&#x27;s fourth car while Giancarlo Baghetti re-appeared in a private Ferrari. Once again Jack Brabham was the only driver with the new Climax V8 engine. Stirling Moss ran his usual Lotus 18 but was not happy with it and Innes Ireland let him have his factory Lotus 21. The organisers, wanting to give the advantage to the Ferrari team decided to use the combined oval/road course again making this Monza the fastest circuit of the year. This circuit had been boycotted by the British teams last year because of the terrible quality of the extremely rough and bumpy concrete banking, which was of such poor quality and design that it even went as far as to badly affect the structural strength and reliability of the cars, particularly in regards to the cars&#x27; chassis and suspension but the British teams relented and they all competed in this year&#x27;s event. As expected the powerful Ferraris were impressive, Von Trips was on pole with Rodriguez second (becoming the youngest driver ever to start a World Championship Grand Prix) ahead of Ginther and Phil Hill with Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM sharing the third row with Baghetti.

This Italian Grand Prix was to be marred by one of the worst tragedies in the history of motor racing, and would cast a shadow over the Italian Grand Prix for years. At the start, Phil Hill and Ginther managed to get into first and second places followed by Rodriguez, the fast-starting Jim Clark and Von Trips. Approaching the Parabolica the two cars collided. Clark crashed without injury but the Ferrari went through a spectator fence, went up an embankment on the left and was tossed into a roll, into where spectators were standing. Von Trips was thrown from the car, landed on the track, broke his neck and was killed along with 14 spectators. The race organisers decided not to stop the race and the Ferrari team put on a display until Rodriguez, Baghetti and Ginther all stopped with mechanical trouble. This left Phil Hill to win. Of the rest, Brabham went out with engine trouble while Surtees retired after running to the back of Bonnier who had slowed his Porsche at the site of Von Trips&#x27;s accident. Moss went out with a broken wheel which left Dan Gurney second for Porsche and Bruce McLaren third for Cooper. Jack Lewis drove a marvellous race in his private Cooper to finish fourth ahead of Tony Brooks (BRM) and Roy Salvadori (Parnell Cooper). Von Trips&#x27;s fatal retirement meant that Phil Hill became the first American to win the Formula 1 World Championship.

===Race 8: United States===
The only non-European championship race of 1961 was the United States GP, which was being held at the 2.3 mile Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York for the first time 4 weeks after the tragic Italian race. Having won both World Championships Ferrari decided not to bother crossing the Atlantic, denying Phil Hill the chance to race at the Glen. Not counting the famous Indianapolis 500, run to totally different regulations and not included again on the Grand Prix calendar from 1961 onwards, this was the 3rd time the US GP had been held since the international championship started in 1950, with one off-spells at Sebring in Florida and Riverside in southern California failing to achieve any success. Watkins Glen would continuously host the US GP up until 1980.

Both Jack Brabham and Stirling Moss had the new Climax V8 engine on this occasion but Moss decided after practice not to race it. The field was joined by a number of local stars, notably Hap Sharp and Roger Penske in Coopers and Jim Hall and Ken Miles in Lotuses. Brabham took pole position with Graham Hill alongside while Moss shared the second row with Bruce McLaren in the second factory Cooper.

A paid crowd of 28,000 (total around 60,000) on Sunday made the sponsors extremely happy and also boded well for the race&#x27;s future. At the start, Brabham led the field off the grid and into the first corner, but before the end of the first lap, Moss had moved by into the lead. These two were followed by Ireland (up from eighth), Hill, Dan Gurney, Masten Gregory and McLaren. On lap three, McLaren moved up to third when Ireland spun on oil at the end of the straight. &quot;I nearly went out of the race,&quot; he said. &quot;I went into a whirl, a 360-degree spin, cars were whipping past.&quot; He recovered and continued in eleventh.

By lap 10, Ireland had already stormed his way back to fourth, behind McLaren&#x27;s Cooper, as Moss and Brabham continued to draw away at a second a lap, swapping the lead back and forth. At about one-third distance, on lap 34, Brabham&#x27;s V8 began to leak water and overheat. With puffs of smoke appearing from the left-side exhaust, the Cooper dropped back from Moss and finally entered the pits on lap 45. After taking on water and returning to the race, Brabham completed only seven more laps before retiring.

Leading now by over 40 seconds, Moss seemed on his way to a comfortable victory. Only he knew, however, that his oil pressure was dropping, and on lap 59, the dark blue Lotus peeled off and retired suddenly, handing the lead to Ireland. Hill was right on the tail of the Scot, hounding him for 15 laps, until he, too, suddenly coasted down the pit lane with a loose magneto wire. The next challenger was Roy Salvadori, who began trimming the lead from 20 seconds down to five with only five laps left. But it was Ireland&#x27;s day. With just over three laps remaining, Salvadori&#x27;s privately entered Cooper blew its engine, just as his teammate John Surtees&#x27; car had done on the first lap.

Ireland came home under the waving chequered flag of Tex Hopkins, less than five seconds ahead of American Dan Gurney, as Britain&#x27;s Tony Brooks finished the last GP of his career in third. It was a race of milestones: Innes Ireland&#x27;s only career win, the first win for Team Lotus, and the first American Grand Prix to turn a profit, ensuring its return in 1962. Unfortunately for Stirling Moss, it would be his last World Championship race, as his career was ended by a heavy accident during the 1962 Glover Trophy race at Goodwood the following April.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Only the best five results counted towards the championship.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. Like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best five results counted towards the cup. The points system for the Drivers&#x27; Championship was adjusted for the season to award 9 points for a win. The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers remained unchanged, however, at 8 points for a win. 

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

* Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored.

<doc id="1140106" wikidata="Q69146" url="?curid=1140106" title="1960 Formula One season">
<text>The 1960 Formula One season was the 14th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 11th World Championship of Drivers, the third International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and five non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship was contested over ten races between 7 February and 20 November 1960.

Jack Brabham driving for Cooper won his second consecutive Drivers&#x27; Championship. Cooper secured their second consecutive Manufacturers&#x27; title.

It was the last year of the 2.5 litre formula, the FIA mandating 1.5 litre engines from on. Rear-engined cars (from Cooper, Lotus, Porsche and BRM) were distinctly more successful than the front-engined designs (from Ferrari, Scarab and Aston Martin). Ferrari did win their home race when the British teams boycotted the event, opposing the organisers&#x27; decision to use the banked circuit. It was the last victory for a front-engined car in a World Championship race.

It was also the last season to include the Indianapolis 500.

Three drivers died in racing accidents: American Harry Schell during practice for the 1960 BRDC International Trophy, and Britons Chris Bristow and Alan Stacey, both killed at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1960 FIA World Championship. All teams competed with tyres supplied by Dunlop.

* Note: The above table does not include drivers who only contested the World Championship race at Indianapolis and does not include teams that only contested that race.

===Team and driver changes===

* Ferrari&#x27;s Dan Gurney moved to BRM and Tony Brooks moved to BRP (racing under Yeoman Credit Racing). Wolfgang von Trips was hired as their full-time driver for 1960.
* At BRP, Brooks would be partnered by Harry Schell from the second round on, were it not for the American&#x27;s fatal accident during the 1960 BRDC International Trophy.
* Graham Hill moved from Lotus to BRM, so Colin Chapman hired John Surtees. The Brit was a very successful motorcycle racing driver, just switching to racing cars for the first time, but he would become a Formula One champion within five years.
* Carroll Shelby had driven for Aston Martin in Formula One and had won the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans with largely the same team, but retired from driving in 1960. He opened a high-performance driving school and, later, the Shelby American company to create the famous AC Cobra sports car.
* Lance Reventlow brought a new constructor to the grid: Scarab. Chuck Daigh and Reventlow himself were the drivers. The front-engined cars turned out to be unreliable and off the pace compared to their rear-engined rivals, and 1960 would be their only season.

====Mid-season changes====

* Ferrari driver Cliff Allison suffered a major crash while practising for the Monaco Grand Prix, and it took him almost the rest of the year to recover from his injuries. He had slammed into a straw barrier and sustained a broken left arm, rib fractures, facial cuts, and a concussion. Later in the year, Belgian Willy Mairesse made his debut with the team.
* Alongside Innes Ireland and Alan Stacey, John Surtees made his debut with Lotus, but because of his commitments in the Isle of Man TT, their Formula Junior driver Jim Clark was promoted to the third F1 seat. When Surtees returned, both Clark and he became permanent drivers, since Stacey had suffered a tragic fatal accident earlier, in the Belgian Grand Prix.
* Chris Bristow was also killed in the Belgian Grand Prix. His seat at BRP was taken up by Henry Taylor and Olivier Gendebien. Together, they had already shared the second and third cars in the team. Taylor would later injure his arm in a heavy crash during practice for the Portuguese Grand Prix.
* Mike Taylor crashed during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix. The steering column weld failed and the car went off track. He was thrown out of the car and actually cut down a tree with his body. He broke several bones and was paralysed but was able to regain the ability to walk through therapy. He later successfully sued Lotus for supplying the faulty chassis.
* Finally, Stirling Moss was injured as well during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix. He missed three races during his recovery.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Argentine Grand Prix returned to the calendar. The 1959 race was cancelled after local heroes Juan Manuel Fangio and José Froilán González had retired and local interest faded.
* The Belgian Grand Prix returned to the calendar, after the 1959 race had been cancelled because of a dispute over start money.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Aintree to Silverstone, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the Portuguese Grand Prix was moved from Circuito de Monsanto to Circuito da Boavista.
* The United States Grand Prix was moved from Sebring to Riverside due to the promoters at Sebring barely breaking even in profits.
* The German Grand Prix was supposed to be held on the AVUS circuit in Berlin but was run as a Formula Two race at the Nürburgring, instead, due to safety concerns at AVUS.
* The Moroccan Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 1 October but it was cancelled due to monetary reasons.

==Regulation changes==
The points-scoring system was changed, with the point for the fastest lap being dropped and a point given for sixth place. The best six scores counted towards the championship, increased from five from the previous season.

==Championship report==
=== Race 1: Argentina ===
The teams came down to Argentina from Europe in February to start the 1960 season, having competed at the last round of the 1959 championship in Sebring, Florida, in the United States only two months previously. Stirling Moss was on pole position in Buenos Aires in his Rob Walker Cooper-Climax with Team Lotus driver Innes Ireland alongside, although he had been 1.6 seconds slower in qualifying. Completing the four-person front row were the BRMs of Hill and Jo Bonnier. The Lotus team had come out with an all-new mid-engined car, the 18, and were expected to be competitive.

At the start, Ireland made a fantastic start and had a good lead at the end of the first lap over Bonnier, Graham Hill, and Phil Hill (no relation to Graham), who had started from the second row in his Ferrari Dino 246. Moss made a poor start and was eighth at the end of the first lap. On the second lap, Ireland spun, and as he was doing this, Moss was driving a blinding lap, passing the Cooper of Carlos Menditeguy, Froilan Gonzalez&#x27;s Ferrari, Jack Brabham&#x27;s Cooper, Phil Hill&#x27;s Ferrari, and Ireland&#x27;s Lotus to run third behind Graham Hill and Bonnier. Moss passed Hill on lap ten and took the lead from Bonnier five laps later. The recovering Ireland also made dramatic progress, passing Brabham and Graham Hill to run third on lap 18. Bonnier attacked Moss for the lead and retook it on lap 21, but 15 laps later, Stirling was back ahead. On lap 42. he went out with a broken suspension. Bonnier was left nearly a lap ahead of everyone. Ireland was promoted to second, but both Graham Hill and Brabham retired, so Bruce McLaren was third. With 12 laps to go, Bonnier suffered engine trouble, and Ireland went into the lead only to have his gear-linkage jam, so he too slipped back, leaving McLaren to win. Cliff Allison was second for Ferrari, while Moss took over Maurice Trintignant&#x27;s car to take third.

=== Race 2: Monaco ===
There had been a non-championship round at the Goodwood circuit near the southern English coast, the Glover Trophy, won by Innes Ireland in a Lotus. During this time, most drivers were competing in sportscar races, such as the 12 Hours of Sebring in March; and the Targa Florio and the Nurburgring 1000km in May.

Moss took pole by a second with Jack Brabham&#x27;s Cooper and Chris Bristow&#x27;s BRP Cooper alongside, while Jo Bonnier shared the second row with Tony Brooks&#x27;s BRP Cooper. Bonnier took the lead at the start, with Brabham second and Moss third ahead of Brooks and Bristow in the BRP Coopers. Moss took Brabham on lap 5 and then shadowed Bonnier until lap 17, when he took the lead. Further back Bristow went out with gearbox trouble. Brabham passed Bonnier on lap 20, but the Swede fought back and, on lap 27, retook the position. The pattern of the race was turned upside-down when rain came. Brabham passed Bonnier and Moss to take the lead while Brooks spun back down the order, leaving McLaren in fourth place, battling with Phil Hill. After six laps in the lead, Brabham spun into the wall at Sainte Dévote, and Moss was back in the lead but had to pit to replace a plug-lead, so Bonnier was back ahead until Moss caught him. Bonnier went out with a broken suspension soon after, and G Hill crashed. This meant that McLaren finished second, with Phil Hill third and Brooks the only other survivor. Moss went on to win his 2nd Monaco Grand Prix from McLaren and Phil Hill.

=== Race 3: Indianapolis 500 ===
The Indy 500, on the World Championship calendar for the final time in 1960, was the only race not run to FIA regulations. Jim Rathmann won this race, which took place on a holiday-day Monday, in an Offenhauser-powered Watson chassis after a thrilling battle for the lead with Rodger Ward.

=== Race 4: Netherlands ===
Although there were disputes over prize money and several teams withdrew after qualifying, there was still a decent field for the race with Stirling Moss on pole position in his Walker Lotus-Climax. Jack Brabham was alongside in his Cooper-Climax, and Innes Ireland was on the outside of the front row in his factory Lotus 18. The BRMs of Jo Bonnier and Graham Hill shared the second row. Brabham made the best start and led Moss and Ireland with Team Lotus&#x27;s Alan Stacey up from the third row on the grid and Phil Hill sixth in his Ferrari from the fourth row. Stacey passed Ireland on the second lap, but Innes soon took back the place while Bruce McLaren moved ahead of Phil Hill in his Cooper. He would retire early with a driveshaft problem. Dan Gurney moved into fifth in his BRM, but he crashed at the hairpin after a brake failure. A spectator in a prohibited area was killed. Jim Clark had made rapid progress in the early laps and took Gurney&#x27;s fifth place behind his Lotus teammates Ireland and Stacey. On lap 17, Brabham&#x27;s car threw up part of a curb, which hit Moss&#x27;s car and caused a puncture and damage to the wheel hub. Moss had to pit for repairs. He drove a storming comeback. Up front, the order remained static until Graham Hill passed Clark, who retired soon afterwards with gearbox failure. Stacey would disappear with a similar problem, leaving Hill to finish third, just ahead of the charging Moss. The Ferraris of Phil Hill and Ritchie Ginther were fifth and sixth but were a lap behind the leaders.

=== Race 5: Belgium ===
The Belgian Grand Prix of 1960 was one of the most disastrous races in Formula 1 history, with the weekend claiming two drivers and two others suffering serious injuries in practice. This race, which took place at the second-fastest and perhaps the most dangerous circuit of the year, the Spa-Francorchamps circuit in the southern part of Belgium, saw two significant accidents on Friday, with Moss suffering an axle failure at the super-fast Burnenville corner and being thrown from the car in the ensuing crash. He broke both his legs. Formula 1 debutante Mike Taylor suffered a steering failure in his Lotus at the Holowell corner and crashed into trees beside the track suffering multiple injuries, which ended his career. Jack Brabham took pole position for Cooper, two and a half seconds faster than the older BRP-run Cooper of Tony Brooks, with Phil Hill&#x27;s Ferrari sharing the front row. Behind them were the BRP Cooper of local hero Olivier Gendebien and Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM. On race day, Brabham took the lead at the start, and he would lead from start to finish. Gendebien made an excellent start to be second but then faded, while Team Lotus&#x27;s Innes Ireland moved up into second place, although he would disappear soon afterwards with clutch trouble. On lap 20, British BRP Cooper driver Chris Bristow, fighting for sixth with the Ferrari of Willy Mairesse, lost control at Malmedy and crashed. He was thrown from the car, landed in some barbed-wire fencing, and was decapitated. Within five laps, Briton Alan Stacey of Team Lotus was also dead, having been hit in the face by a bird near the Masta kink. He crashed, his car was launched off an embankment, landed in a field some 25 feet lower than the track, and burst into flames, with Stacey still in the car, where he burned to death. Brabham won the race while Bruce McLaren in the second works Cooper emerged to finish second, giving the company a 1–2 finish with Graham Hill third, but celebrations were muted. It would remain the blackest weekend in World Championship history until the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

=== Race 6: France ===
Three weeks after the disastrous Belgian Grand Prix, the World Championship contenders gathered at the super-fast straights of Reims. Stirling Moss was out of action. Tony Brooks had switched from the BRP Cooper team to try the new Vanwall VW11, while Team Lotus had hired Ron Flockhart to replace Alan Stacey. BRP had two new drivers in, Henry Taylor and Bruce Halford. In practice, both Scarabs blew their engines, so neither Lance Reventlow nor Chuck Daigh was able to race. Jack Brabham was on pole position by 1.4 seconds, with Phil Hill&#x27;s Ferrari and Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM sharing the front row. Behind them were Innes Ireland&#x27;s factory Lotus 18 and the Ferrari of Willy Mairesse. At the start, Graham Hill was caught unprepared, and as he tried to get the BRM off the line, he was hit from behind by the Scuderia Centro Sud Cooper of Maurice Trintignant. There was also a collision between Brooks and Lucien Bianchi&#x27;s outdated Cooper. The battle for the lead involved Brabham and Phil Hill, and the pair switched places lap after lap until Hill began to fade with transmission trouble. A similar problem took out third-placed Ferrari driver Wolfgang Von Trips, so Brabham was left out in front alone. Mairesse retired with a similar problem, and Ireland had to stop with a broken front suspension. Also retiring were the two surviving BRMS of Dan Gurney and Jo Bonnier disappeared with engine trouble. This left Gendebien in the BRP Cooper to take second, with Bruce McLaren third in the second factory Cooper and Taylor finishing fourth in his BRP Cooper; the company could boast a 1–2–3–4 finish. The Lotuses of Jim Clark and Flockhart finished fifth and sixth.

=== Race 7: Britain ===
Although there was only a fortnight between the French and British GPs, several changes occurred when the F1 circus arrived at Silverstone. The Vanwall VW11 did not re-appear: Tony Brooks went back to his BRP Cooper, and with both Scarabs having blown up at Reims, they were not present, although Chuck Daigh and Lance Reventlow shared a third factory Cooper, Daigh being faster and thus getting to race. Aston Martin showed up with DBR5s for Roy Salvadori and Maurice Trintignant. At the same time, motorcycle ace John Surtees re-appeared in a works Lotus, and there was the usual crop of British privateers, including Keith Greene in the Gilby Engineering Cooper-Maserati and Brian Naylor in his JBW-Maserati. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Jack Brabham, a second faster than Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM, with Bruce McLaren&#x27;s Cooper and Jo Bonnier&#x27;s BRM making it a balanced front row. The start saw three cars stall: Graham Hill (his second race running) and the two BRP Coopers of Brooks and Henry Taylor. McLaren was second on the first lap but soon dropped behind Bonnier and the factory Lotus of Innes Ireland. Ireland then passed Bonnier to take second place. Graham Hill drove a storming race from the back of the field and worked his way back, passing Ireland for second after 37 laps and setting off after Brabham. To the crowd&#x27;s delight, he caught him and, on lap 55, took the lead. Further back, Surtees displaced Ireland in third place. Hill had been suffering brake problems for some time, and on lap 72, he spun at Copse Corner and was out. Brabham took the lead and, five laps later, took the chequered flag with Surtees and Ireland second and third for Team Lotus.

=== Race 8: Portugal ===
With the German Grand Prix being cancelled after safety concerns and complaints about the general quality of the AVUS track in Berlin, there was a month between the British and Portuguese GPs. At the challenging and dangerous Boavista street circuit in Porto, Stirling Moss made his F1 comeback after being out of action since the disastrous Belgian GP in June. The only other change of note was that local hero Mario Cabral was found a drive in the second Scuderia Centro Sud Cooper-Maserati. In practice, Henry Taylor crashed his BRP Cooper heavily and injured his arm, while Jim Clark smashed up his Lotus in a rare crash. Despite the accident, pole position went to Team Lotus driver John Surtees, who edged out Dan Gurney&#x27;s BRM by a few hundredths of a second. Jack Brabham was third quickest in his normally-dominant works Cooper. Moss put his Walker Lotus on the second row alongside Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM. Brabham took the lead at the start, but Gurney quickly found a way ahead, and then Brabham went wide at one corner and dropped to sixth place. Moss emerged second, with Surtees and Phil Hill in his Ferrari fighting with him. After ten laps, Gurney dropped back with an oil leak, so Surtees took the lead with Moss in pursuit but had to stop because of spark plug problems and dropped to the back of the field. He was later disqualified for driving against the direction of the race while trying to get going after a spin. Brabham had a lively fight with Phil Hill until the American crashed, and this became the lead on lap 36 when Surtees went off because oil had leaked onto his pedals. Bruce McLaren came through to finish second to give Cooper another 1–2 result, with Clark finishing third in his cobbled-together Lotus. Brabham&#x27;s victory meant he clinched the World Championship with two races remaining. But this was to be the last Portuguese Grand Prix for 24 years – the race would not return until 1984.

=== Race 9: Italy ===
With the World Championship settled in favour of Jack Brabham and the Italian authorities deciding that the Italian Grand Prix would be held on the combined road and oval course at the Monza Autodrome near Milan (making it the fastest circuit of the year), all the big British teams boycotted the event, citing the fragility, extreme roughness and poor construction of the concrete banking and the field consisted of the works Ferraris, the Coopers of Scuderia Eugenio Castellotti and Scuderia Centro Sud and a few privateers. To increase the size of the field, Formula 2 cars were allowed, with Porsche turning up with a pair of 718s for Hans Herrmann and Edgar Barth.

The powerful Ferraris dominated, with Phil Hill sharing the front row with fellow American Ritchie Ginther and Willy Mairesse with a couple of Coopers on the second row. In the race, Ginther and Hill led while Mairesse was slowed by team orders to help tow a fourth Ferrari – an F2 car driven by Wolfgang Von Trips – away from the two Porsches. This allowed Giulio Cabianca to run third in his Castellotti Cooper. Mairesse eventually returned to third place while Hill passed early leader Ginther to win the race. Ferrari finished 1–2–3, but it was an irrelevant result given the competition.

=== Race 10: USA ===
The final World Championship event of the year took place in the United States 10 weeks after the penultimate event. Ferrari did not travel to the Riverside circuit just east of Los Angeles, California, but Phil Hill found a ride in a fourth BRP Cooper at his home circuit, and Wolfgang Von Trips found a ride in a Cooper-Maserati run by Scuderia Centro Sud. In the sunny and pleasant southern California weather, Ron Flockhart turned up in the third factory Cooper and Jim Hall made his F1 debut in a private Lotus 18 and Chuck Daigh re-appeared in one of Lance Reventlow&#x27;s Scarabs. Moss, by then recovered from his early season injuries, took pole by 0.6 seconds from World Champion Jack Brabham and Dan Gurney in his BRM. Jo Bonnier&#x27;s BRM shared the second row with Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus. Brabham made the best start and led Moss for the first four laps, but then he heard an explosion at the car&#x27;s back end and pitted. He made two stops to try to solve the problem, which was traced to overflow petrol hitting the hot exhausts of the Climax engine. Moss moved into the lead when Brabham pitted, and he stayed ahead all the way to the chequered flag. Early on, he was chased by Gurney, but he went out with plug problems, and Bonnier followed, retiring from second with engine trouble. This left Innes Ireland to finish second for Team Lotus, with the second factory Cooper of Bruce McLaren third. Brabham finished fourth, a lap behind at the finish. Jim Hall drove an excellent race to run fourth, but he dropped to seventh at the end when his transmission failed, and he had to push the car to the finish line. This was the only Grand Prix ever held at the Riverside circuit; 12 Hours of Sebring promoter Alec Ulmann had again broken even on this event, just as he had at the previous year&#x27;s American Grand Prix at Sebring. The US Grand Prix was moved to the Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York on the other side of the country.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Only the best six results counted towards the championship. This was the first season in which points for fastest laps were not awarded. No points were awarded for shared drives.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. Indy 500 results did not count towards the cup. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best six results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

* † Position shared between more drivers of the same car – no points awarded

===International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings===

*Bold results counted to championship totals.

==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One races were held in 1960, which did not count towards the World Championship.

<doc id="1140108" wikidata="Q69118" url="?curid=1140108" title="1959 Formula One season">
<text>The 1959 Formula One season was the 13th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 10th World Championship of Drivers, the second International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and five non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship was contested over nine races between 10 May and 12 December 1959.

At the beginning of the year, there were no world champions on the grid. Five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio had retired after last year, as had reigning champion Mike Hawthorn. Tragically, just three months after Hawthorn was crowned, he lost his life in a road accident.

Going into the final race, there were three drivers that could clinch their first championship. Jack Brabham driving for Cooper ran out of fuel but pushed his car over the line to win his first Drivers&#x27; Championship. He was the first Australian champion. Cooper also won their first Manufacturers&#x27; title.

Two F1 drivers lost their lives in racing accidents. Firstly, Jean Behra raced in the sports car race that preceded the 1959 German Grand Prix at AVUS. Rain had been falling and the track was slippery. After two teammates had already crashed, Behra&#x27;s Porsche 718 RSK went over the top of the 43 degree banked turn and he incurred a skull fracture when he struck a flagpole with his head. And Ivor Bueb crashed his BRP Formula Two car at the Charade Circuit. He was thrown from the car and died six days later in hospital.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1959 FIA World Championship.

Note: The above list does not reflect competitors in the 1959 Indianapolis 500.

===Team and driver changes===

* Vanwall owner Tony Vandervell&#x27;s health declined, which meant was their last full season. The team would enter a handful of races in the following years, of which just one in 1959. Ex-driver Stirling Moss moved to Rob Walker Racing Team, racing a private Cooper.
* Scuderia Ferrari started the season with a fresh line-up: 1958 champion Mike Hawthorn had retired from racing, Wolfgang von Trips moved to the new Porsche works team, and Olivier Gendebien went to focus on sports car and endurance racing. Joining the team were Jean Behra from BRM, Tony Brooks from Vanwall, and Cliff Allison from Lotus.
* After trying out in a couple of Formula Two races, the Porsche works team entered their cars in an F1 race. This year, it would only be the Monaco Grand Prix, and in 1960, just the Italian Grand Prix. After that, however, they would go for two full-time seasons.
* Lotus replaced Cliff Allison with Pete Lovely.
* Cooper signed Masten Gregory to replace Roy Salvadori, who found a part-time seat at the new Aston Martin works team. He was joined by Carroll Shelby, who had made his debut in 1958 as Gregory&#x27;s teammate at several private Maserati teams.

====Mid-season changes====

* After two disappointing results, most notable his failure to qualify for the Monaco Grand Prix, Lotus driver Pete Lovely was sacked and replaced by successful sports car driver Innes Ireland. (After one more attempt in , Lovely would wait until to make his return with money from his Volkswagen dealership.) Ireland was replaced by Alan Stacey in the British Grand Prix due to illness.
* After two races, Stirling Moss moved from Rob Walker Racing Team to BRP. After another two races, he moved back.
* Jean Behra was sacked by Scuderia Ferrari after the French Grand Prix as a result of punching team manager Romolo Tavoni and another patron at a restaurant when a discussion got heated. Behra would race for the works Porsche, in which he had also taken up a managing role. However, he crashed his Porsche 718 RSK in the sports car race that supported the German Grand Prix at AVUS. His car went over the top of the banked corner and Behra incurred a skull fracture when he struck a flagpole with his head. Porsche withdrew the team for the remainder of the season.
* During the German Grand Prix, BRP driver Hans Hermann lost his brakes and had a spectacular crash. He was thrown out and slid along the track while his car somersaulted multiple times. BRP withdrew the team for the remainder of the season.
* Hermann&#x27;s teammate Ivor Bueb died when he crashed during a Formula Two race at the Charade Circuit.
* Cooper driver Masten Gregory missed the last two races because of an accident in another championship. He jumped out of his Jaguar before the impact, but sustained a broken leg and shoulder in his fall. Maserati driver Giorgio Scarlatti substituted for him in the Italian Grand Prix.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The United States Grand Prix was organised for the first time: Sebring International Raceway hosted the season finale on 12 December.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Aintree, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.
* The German Grand Prix was moved from the Nürburgring to AVUS.
* The Portuguese Grand Prix was moved from Circuito da Boavista to Monsanto Park Circuit.
* The Argentine Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 25 January but was cancelled after local heroes Juan Manuel Fangio and Jose Froilan Gonzalez had retired and local interest faded.
* The Belgian Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 14 June, but it was cancelled due to a dispute over start money.
* The Moroccan Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 1 October but it was cancelled because of monetary reasons.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 4===
With the Argentine Grand Prix gone, the season began at the latest point in the year since , with the Monaco Grand Prix on 10 May 1959. Jean Behra for Ferrari, Jack Brabham for Cooper and Stirling Moss, driving a Cooper for Rob Walker, were fighting for pole position. It was Moss who set the fastest time in the end, with Behra and Brabham within half a second in second and third. On race day, Behra had the best start and went round the outside of Moss through the first hairpin. The lone works Porsche, driven by Wolfgang von Trips, spun on some oil on the second lap and was collected by three other drivers. The leading trio were nose-to-tail until, on lap 22, Behra&#x27;s Ferrari developed an oil leak and retired. At half distance, only eight cars were left running, with Moss at a sizeable lead over Brabham and Tony Brooks, third in the championship last year. On lap 81, however, Moss sensed a vibration and visited the pits. Nothing was visibly wrong, so he rejoined in the lead, but later that lap, his transmission failed and his race was over. This left Brabham (Cooper) to claim his first career podium and win, 20 seconds ahead of Brooks (Ferrari) and two laps ahead of veteran racer and last year&#x27;s Monaco winner Maurice Trintignant (Cooper).

The Indianapolis 500 saw Rodger Ward take his first of two career victories. There was no overlap between the Indy 500 and F1 drivers. It would be the last year in which the race counted towards the F1 championship.
For the Dutch Grand Prix, Jo Bonnier, driving for the BRM works team, clinched his first career pole, ahead of Brabham, who achieved the same lap time but at a later moment, and Moss, two tenths behind. Bonnier held the lead at the start, but lost it on the second lap to seventh-starting Masten Gregory. On lap 12, Gregory&#x27;s Cooper started jumping out of gear, so Bonnier went by. Brabham inherited second place and then challenged the Swede for the lead, but then had to manage similar problems to his teammate. Aston Martin were making their debut this race, but both cars soon retired with engine failure. Meanwhile, Moss was up to third place and the fastest man on track. He passed Brabham on lap 49 by out-braking him into Tarzan corner and then grabbed the lead on lap 60 when Bonnier was held up by a backmarker. A mere three laps later, however, the Cooper&#x27;s transmission failed, causing Moss to retire from the lead for the second time in a row. Bonnier scored his first and only career win, ahead of Brabham and Gregory.

The French Grand Prix received the honorary title of &quot;European Grand Prix&quot; and was contested on the public highways around Reims. The Ferrari team entered five cars and their high-speed advantage put three of them on the first two rows of the grid. Pole position was for Brooks, ahead of championship leader Brabham and Ferrari teammate Phil Hill. Fifth-starting Moss, who had moved to the BRP team, passed three cars into the first corner, but was overtaken himself by seventh-starting Gregory. On lap 6, Trintignant, in the surprisingly quick Cooper, was the next driver to grab second place. Gregory retired when he was overcome by the summer heat, which reached in the sun. His team then saw that the American&#x27;s face was cut by the bitumen and stones that were becoming dislodged. Ron Flockhart took a stone to the eye but raced on to take sixth place. Graham Hill retired when one of those rocks went through his radiator. While Trintignant stopped to cool off, Bonnier&#x27;s engine had seized, but the Swede pushed his car a full kilometer back to the pits. At the front, Brooks was leading Hill and Brabham and that became the order at the finish. Moss got up to second briefly but then retired when his clutch failed. He asked for a push start from bystanders, knowing that it would get him disqualified, but longing for the shade of the garages.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jack Brabham (Cooper) was leading with 19 points, ahead of Tony Brooks (Ferrari) with 14 and Phil Hill (Ferrari) with 9. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Cooper was leading with 18 points, ahead of Ferrari with 16 and BRM with 8.

===Rounds 5 to 8===
The Ferrari team did not compete in the British Grand Prix over labour disputes back in Italy. Tony Brooks borrowed a Vanwall from his old team boss to, at least theoretically, be able to challenge Jack Brabham for the lead in the championship. Brabham took pole position in his Cooper, ahead of Roy Salvadori in the Aston Martin, who set the same time but at a later moment, and Harry Schell in the BRM. Salvadori went down to ninth at the start and Brooks, from his seventeenth starting place, fell even further. Brabham held the lead ahead of Schell and Bonnier. After ten laps, Stirling Moss had gotten up to second place and on lap 25, Bruce McLaren went up to third, and so stayed the order until the finish. McLaren had managed to get side-by-side with Moss and finished two tenths of a second behind.

Instead of the traditional Nürburgring, the German Grand Prix was held at the AVUS circuit, which consisted of two Autobahn straights of , linked together by a hairpin at one end and a 43 degre banked turn at the other. With fears about tyre safety, the Grand Prix was separated into two heats of one hour, adding the drivers&#x27; times together, and streamlining was forbidden by stipulating that all cars had to have the front wheels exposed at all times. In the supporting sports car race, it was the rain that caused peril: three of the leading Porsches crashed out, of which Jean Behra came off worst. His car flew over the banking, his head struck a flagpole and the Frenchman was killed. In a gloomy atmosphere, Brooks took pole position for the Grand Prix, ahead of Moss and Gurney. Fifth-starting Gregory was up to second after the first hairpin and Moss retired soon after with a failing transmission. Championship leader Brabham retired with the same issue. The remaining Coopers and Ferraris seemed equally strong and the lead switch hands multiple times, until the Climax engine broke and Gregory coasted to a standstill. Ferrari was 1-2-3 at the end of the first heat. After a short break to change tyres and mend some damage, nine cars were left to start the second heat. BRP driver Hans Hermann lost his brakes and had a spectacular crash. He was thrown out and slid along the track while his car somersaulted multiple times. The red cars from Italy showed their dominance, taking an easy victory and completing a victory lap three-abreast. After adding up the heats, Brooks was given the victory, three seconds ahead of Gurney and a minute ahead of Hill.

The Portuguese Grand Prix was run on the much appraised Monsanto road course, and the twisty nature of the track gave the advantage to the lightweight Coopers: Moss qualified on pole, ahead of the two works drivers, Brabham and Gregory, and then came teammate Trintignant. Gurney was the first Ferrari in sixth. Eight-starting McLaren, the third works Cooper driver, joined the leading pack after the first lap. On lap 5, Phil Hill collided with Graham Hill and both retired on the spot. Moss was the fastest man on track, as he had been so many times, and this time, his car held on for him to take the win, a lap ahead of Gregory. Gurney had managed to get by Trintignant to take third. Brabham had crashed heavily on lap 24, but walked away unhurt, and McLaren retired with transmission failure.

Even at Monza, the track synonymous with speed, the Cooper team was giving home favourite Ferrari a run for their money. Moss took pole, ahead of Brooks and Brabham. Brooks had a bad start and a piston broke, causing him to retire immediately. Moss let fifth-starting Hill by into the lead, to follow the Ferrari and conserve his tyres. Gurney completed the leading trio and positions changed every lap. Moss&#x27;s plan worked, as Hill and Gurney had to change tyres on lap 33 and 34, so the only remaining fear was for his Cooper to let him down. But it held on, Moss even lapped the Ferrari of Cliff Allison, and took the win, ahead of Hill and Brabham.

With one round to go, the Drivers&#x27; Championship had seen Jack Brabham (Cooper) in the lead since the beginning. The Australian had gathered 31 points. But Stirling Moss (Cooper) and Tony Brooks had scored two wins, just like Brabham, and were following on 25.5 and 23 points, respectively. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Cooper was leading with 38 points, ahead of Ferrari with 32 and BRM with 18.

===Round 9===
The first United States Grand Prix was held at Sebring International Raceway, combining two runways of the regional airport and a series of technical corners. For the first time since , three drivers were in contention for the title going into the final race. Jack Brabham would be the champion if he won the race. If he would not win, he would at least have to finish ahead of Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks. Meanwhile, Moss had to finish at least second with Brabham behind him. Brooks, because of his eight-point deficit, would simply have to win, while hoping for his rivals&#x27; misfortune. Moss took pole position, ahead of Brabham and Harry Schell, making it three Coopers on the front row. Brooks had to pit after the first lap, because his teammate Von Trips had rear-ended him, giving him no more realistic chances for the title. In five laps, Moss achieved a lead of ten seconds over Brabham, before his gearbox packed up and he coasted to a halt. After four years of finishing in second place, he would be denied the championship once again. Brabham and teammate McLaren ran to the finish as a solid duo, although Moss&#x27;s teammate Trintignant was putting some real pressure on. A mere mile from the finish, drama ensued as Brabham ran out of fuel and McLaren went by to take the win, half a second ahead of Trintignant. With Moss out and Brooks not winning (he would finish third), the championship was sealed, but Brabham wanted to finish strong and started pushing his car towards the line. Five minutes after his teammate, he crossed the line to the cheers of the crowd. He was classified as fourth, as the three remaining runners were still multiple laps behind.

Jack Brabham, driving for Cooper, won his first Drivers&#x27; Championship with 31 points, ahead of Tony Brooks (Ferrari) with 27 and Stirling Moss (Cooper) with 25.5. Cooper won their first Manufacturers&#x27; Championship with 40 points, ahead of Ferrari with 32 and BRM with 18.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best five results counted towards the championship. No points were awarded for shared drives. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race, although fastest lap points were not counted. Indy 500 results did not count towards the cup. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best five results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points, from the best five results; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

* &quot;Italics&quot; indicates the fastest lap (One point awarded – point shared equally between drivers sharing fastest lap)
* Bold indicates pole position

===International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings===
*Bold results counted to championship totals.

===Non-championship races===
Five Formula One races which did not count towards the World Championship were held in 1959.

<text>William Hemsley (January 23, 1737 – June 5, 1812) was an American planter and political leader from Maryland. He represented Maryland in the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783.

Hemsley&#x27;s entire life was closely connected with his family&#x27;s plantation, Clover Fields Farm, in Queen Anne&#x27;s County on Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore. The family had been established there and in Talbot County for several generations. His career in public service was similar to that of many prominent planters. He was a county official in both counties at various times and served as a colonel in the militia of Queen Anne&#x27;s County during the Revolutionary War. He was a delegate to the Maryland State Convention of 1788, to vote whether Maryland should ratify the proposed Constitution of the United States.

Hemsley was first elected to the Maryland state senate in November 1779. He would serve in that body until 1781. Then in 1782–1783, he served in the Continental Congress in New York. He was again elected to the state senate in 1784 but declined that election. He would serve again from 1786 to 1789. Although re-elected again in 1790, he did not serve. He was a member of the Maryland Convention that ratified the United States Constitution on April 28, 1788.

His later years were spent running the family plantation. He died there on June 5, 1812, and was buried in the family&#x27;s cemetery on the farm, near Queenstown, Maryland. His son, William Hemsley Jr., also served in the state senate in 1799–1800.

<text>The 1958 Formula One season was the 12th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 9th World Championship of Drivers, the first International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and five non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship was contested over eleven races between 19 January and 19 October 1958. The Indianapolis 500 counted towards the Drivers&#x27; Championship but not the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup.

British driver Mike Hawthorn driving for Ferrari won his first and only Drivers&#x27; Championship after a close battle with compatriot Stirling Moss. Following the Portuguese Grand Prix, Hawthorn faced a penalty, but Moss sportingly spoke up for him. Moss would go on to win four races over Hawthorn&#x27;s one, but the points from the Portuguese round enabled Hawthorn to claim the title. It was the first of only two occasions in Formula One history where a driver won the championship, having won only one race in the season, the other being Keke Rosberg in . Vanwall won the inaugural Manufacturers&#x27; Cup.

Four drivers died during the season: American Pat O&#x27;Connor during the Indianapolis 500, Italian Luigi Musso (Ferrari) during the French Grand Prix, his British teammate Peter Collins during the German Grand Prix, and Brit Stuart Lewis-Evans (Vanwall) during the Moroccan Grand Prix. After Collins&#x27; accident, Hawthorn had decided to retire from racing at the end of the season. So he did, but then, tragically, lost his life in a road accident three months later.

Since the early 1900s, Grand Prix racing had been dominated by front-engined cars, but this was the last championship to be won by one. From on, mid-engined cars, with their better road holding, increased driving comfort, lighter weight, and ease on tires and mechanical components (particularly brakes), would have the upper hand.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1958 FIA World Championship.
* The above list does not include drivers who only contested the Indianapolis 500.
* Pink background denotes Formula Two cars at the German and Moroccan Grand Prix.

===Team and driver changes===
* Due to financial difficulties, Maserati had withdrawn their works team after , despite their 250F still being competitive. Multiple private teams adopted the existing chassis.
* Lotus made their debut. Colin Chapman&#x27;s team would go on to win six Drivers&#x27; and seven Constructors&#x27; Championships in the next twenty years.
* For BRM, it was their first full-time season, and they hired ex-Maserati drivers Jean Behra and Harry Schell.
* Cooper also entered more races than ever, while retaining their drivers from 1957.

====Mid-season changes====
* Ferrari driver Luigi Musso was fatally injured during the French Grand Prix when he ran wide, his car struck a ditch and somersaulted. He was airlifted to hospital with critical head injuries and died later that day.
* His teammate Peter Collins was killed in a very similar crash during the German Grand Prix. Collins ran wide, encountered a ditch and flipped into the air. Collins was thrown out and struck a tree, suffering critical head injuries, and died in hospital later that day. Ferrari drafted in their sports car drivers Olivier Gendebien and Phil Hill.
* Five-time World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio retired after the French race. The Argentine had earned so much respect that champion-to-be Mike Hawthorn braked on the final straight, so that Fangio could unlap himself and complete the full race distance. Fangio still holds the record for the highest percentage of races won, the highest percentage of pole positions and the highest percentage of fastest laps.
* Swedish driver Jo Bonnier had entered the season under his own name but moved to BRM for the final two races of the season. Nevertheless, Giulio Cabianca and Hans Herrmann finished the season for Bonnier&#x27;s team.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Dutch and Belgian Grand Prix returned to the calendar after being cancelled in 1956 and 1957 due to the Suez Crisis. The Pescara Grand Prix was dropped from the calendar, as it had merely been a replacement for the cancelled rounds.
* The Portuguese and Moroccan Grand Prix hosted their first World Championship Grands Prix.
* After one year at Rouen-Les-Essarts, the French Grand Prix was moved back to Reims-Gueux.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Aintree Motor Racing Circuit to Silverstone Circuit, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.

==Regulation changes==

===Sporting regulations===
* The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers was awarded for the first time.
* Minimum race lengths were reduced to or two hours (whichever came first).
* The practice of sharing cars during a race was discouraged by withholding championship points. (Example: Gregory and Shelby finished fourth in the Italian Grand Prix but were not awarded championship points.)

===Technical regulations===
* The use of commercial petrol became compulsory in place of specialised alcohol-based racing fuels.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 4===

Because the new regulations around fuel were drawn up late, many of the British teams were not ready in time for the season opener, the Argentine Grand Prix, and the race had just ten entrants, the lowest ever: three from Scuderia Ferrari, six private Maseratis and Stirling Moss in a Cooper from Rob Walker Racing, 1958 being the team&#x27;s first full season. Five-time and reigning champion Juan Manuel Fangio qualified on pole position in one of the Maseratis he took over from the works team, ahead of the Ferraris of Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins. At the start, Collins immediately broke a drive shaft. Hawthorn shot into the lead but was quickly repassed by Fangio. Around half distance, however, the Argentinian had to pit for fresh rear tyres. Moss took the lead and gambled on not needing a pit stop. The canvas was showing on both wheels, but he held on to win, just ahead of the Ferrari duo of Luigi Musso and Mike Hawthorn.

A full four months later, the Monaco Grand Prix saw no less than 30 drivers trying to qualify for 16 places on the starting grid. The British teams were present and quick off the mark: Tony Brooks qualified on pole for Vanwall, ahead of Jean Behra for BRM and the Cooper duo of Jack Brabham and Roy Salvadori. The latter had the best start, arriving at the first corner in the lead, but he braked too late and bent his steering column. Behra and Brooks drew away but Hawthorn was the fastest man on track. He passed the Vanwall on lap 18, which retired shortly after with a loose spark plug, and took the lead on lap 27, when Behra&#x27;s brakes seemed to fade. In the next phase, Stirling Moss, who was back at Vanwall, was fastest and briefly took the lead, before his engine started misfiring and he, too, retired. Veteran racer Maurice Trintignant, who had taken Moss&#x27; place at Rob Walker Racing, had started fifth but took advantage of his rivals&#x27; misfortune, including, on lap 46, that of Hawthorn, whose Ferrari had shaken its fuel pump loose. Trintignant completed the 100 laps to take victory, ahead of Musso and Collins. Rob Walker Racing had taken a second win in a row ahead of two Ferraris.
The front row for the Dutch Grand Prix was occupied by Vanwalls: Lewis-Evans, Moss and Brooks. Moss took the lead at the start, ahead of Lewis-Evans, while seventh-starting Harry Schell in the BRM got up to third and then took second place on lap 12. Moss kept out of trouble and took the win, while his teammates both retired. The BRM duo of Schell and Behra completed the podium, while Hawthorn was the first Ferrari in fifth place.

A couple of days later, the Indianapolis 500 was run. Fangio had skipped the Dutch GP and tried to race in the Indy 500 but failed to qualify. Pat O&#x27;Connor died in a spectacular first-lap pileup, while reigning USAC champion Jimmy Bryan won the race.

In the F1 Drivers&#x27; Championship, Stirling Moss (Vanwall) was leading with 17 points, ahead of Luigi Musso (Ferrari) and Maurice Trintignant (Cooper). The Manufacturers&#x27; Championship saw Cooper take the lead with 19 points, ahead of Ferrari (14) and Vanwall (8).

===Rounds 5 to 8===
The Belgian Grand Prix had been given the honorary title of &quot;European Grand Prix&quot; and marked the first start by a female driver, Maria Teresa de Filippis. The high-speed nature of Spa-Francorchamps saw the three Ferraris start in the top five, with Mike Hawthorn and Luigi Musso at the top, but the quick-starting Vanwalls of Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks formed the leading duo after the first corner. Before the first lap was over, however, Moss made an erroneous gear change and destroyed his engine. Brooks took over the lead but was overtaken by Peter Collins. The lead changed hands a couple of times, before the Ferrari overheated and had to be retired. Brooks won the race, twenty seconds ahead of Hawthorn and three minutes ahead of teammate Lewis-Evans. Dramatically, all three cars broke down coming out of the last corners, but managed to coast over the finish line, so would the race have been one lap longer, the result would have been very different.
Like in Belgium, Ferrari&#x27;s Hawthorn and Musso qualified on top for the French Grand Prix, ahead of Harry Schell (BRM), who managed to take the lead at the start but fell back to seventh on lap 2. Hawthorn was the fastest man on track, while Musso tried hard to keep him in view, until on lap 10, the Italian pushed too hard and ran wide. His car struck a ditch and somersaulted. Musso was airlifted to hospital with critical head injuries and would pass away later that day. Hawthorn won the race, ahead of championship rival Moss and teammate Von Trips.

The British Grand Prix at Silverstone saw three different British teams on the front row: Moss for Vanwall, Schell for BRM and Salvadori for Cooper. But Ferrari drivers Collins and Hawthorn were lying first and third after the first lap. Moss held on to second place until, on lap 26, his engine blew up. Ferrari scored a 1–2, ahead of Salvadori achieving his first career podium. Five-time champion and reigning Juan Manuel Fangio retired after this race.
Championship leader Hawthorn started on pole position for the German Grand Prix, ahead of Brooks and Moss. The latter snatched the lead and set multiple lap records in the early phase. He had a lead of 17 seconds over Collins and Hawthorn when his ignition failed and he coasted to a halt. The Ferrari duo seemed free to fight for the win, until Brooks caught up and used his Vanwall&#x27;s agility to take the lead through the twisty sections. On lap 11, Collins went off the road, struck a ditch and flipped into the air. He was thrown out and struck a tree, suffering critical head injuries. He would pass away in hospital later that day. Hawthorn retired with clutch issues on the next lap, handing Brooks the win, with a lead of several minutes over the Coopers of Salvadori and Trintignant.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari) was leading with 30 points, ahead of Stirling Moss (Vanwall) with 24 and Tony Brooks (Vanwall) with 16. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Ferrari was leading with 37, ahead of Vanwall (33) and Cooper (29).

===Rounds 9 to 11===
The Portuguese Grand Prix was part of the championship for the first time and was run at the Circuito da Boavista, a street circuit in Porto. Championship protagonists Stirling Moss and Mike Hawthorn were separated by just 0.05 seconds in qualifying, with the Vanwall placed on pole position and teammate Stuart Lewis-Evans completing the front row. Rain before the start left the roads wet and gave Hawthorn the advantage to take the lead. Ferrari teammate Wolfgang von Trips got up to third, before being passed by Jean Behra in the BRM. The roads dried up and Moss retook the lead on lap 8. He subsequently managed to grow such a big lead that the spectators got bored and, just after half-distance, he lapped his teammate in fourth place. Hawthorn pitted to have his brakes tightened up. Behra passed him, but on lap 41, his engine lost power the Ferrari was back up to second. Lewis-Evans had stayed in Moss&#x27;s slipstream and when Behra moved out of the way for the leader, his teammate could handily snatch third off of the BRM. They could have tried the same with Hawthorn, but Moss stayed behind his rival out of respect. Moss crossed the line to win the race and Lewis-Evans was flagged as third. Hawthorn had to finish the last lap to take second, but he spun and stalled his engine. Many people wanted to help push the Ferrari, but that would have resulted in disqualification, so Moss (already on his victory lap) waved the crowd away and Hawthorn managed to push start the car by himself. Before he could jump back in and take the wheel, however, the car had rolled a couple of yards in the wrong direction of the circuit, so the officials disqualified him after all. Moss again displayed his courtesy and defended his rival, although he would have taken the championship lead. No earlier than 11pm, the decision was reversed and Hawthorn&#x27;s second place was reinstated.
The local Ferrari team were seen as favourites for the Italian Grand Prix, not just by the tifosi, but Moss and Brooks placed their Vanwalls on the top of the grid. Hawthorn started in third but quickly lost out to Lewis-Evans in the third Vanwall. Von Trips hit the rear wheel of Harry Schell, flew into the air and was thrown out of the car before it struck a tree. The BRM somersaulted off the road and luckily landed on his wheels, because Schell was still in the cockpit. Von Trips suffered injury to his leg and would not race in the season finale. Meanwhile, the traditional slipstreaming began at the front and led to multiple lead changes. Future champion Phil Hill was running his first race for the Ferrari F1 team and was running comfortably among the leaders, until on lap 7, he had to pit for a wheel change. Moss retired on lap 17 with gearbox trouble and saw his championship rival take the lead of the race. With Lewis-Evans having retired and Brooks down in fifth after a pit stop, Ferrari looked secure to take a dominant victory. Brooks was the fastest man on track, however, and Hawthorn&#x27;s clutch began to slip. Lap by lap, the Vanwall clawed his way up the order, and took the lead on lap 60. Hawthorn nursed his car to the finish line in second place, while Hill finished third.

Going into the season finale, the first-ever Moroccan Grand Prix, Moss (32 points) had a small chance to win the championship: he had to win the race, with Hawthorn (40 points) finishing third or lower without the fastest lap. In that scenario, the two would tie on points and Moss would win on count-back. Hawthorn started on pole but fell back to third at the start. Moss took the lead, ahead of Phil Hill. The American outbraked himself on lap 3, giving Moss the chance to fly away in front. At half-distance, he led Hill by 20 seconds and Hawthorn was fighting Brooks for third. In the next ten laps, three drivers crashed, all slightly injured, and Lewis-Evans slid off the road when his engine exploded. His car caught fire and the Brit suffered serious burns. Hawthorn was back in second, so Moss won the race comfortably but could not secure the championship. Lewis-Evans would succumb to his injuries six days after the race. Vanwall owner Tony Vandervell ended his involvement with the team, partly as a result of this but also in failing health himself, and Bernie Ecclestone sold his Connaught team and ceased involvement with the sport till .

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari) collected 42 points and won the title, ahead of Stirling Moss (Vanwall) with 41 and Tony Brooks (Vanwall) with 24. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Vanwall won the title with 48 points, ahead of Ferrari (40) and Cooper (31). Until , it would not happen again that different teams won the two championships in the same year.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best six results counted towards the championship. Formula 2 cars were not eligible for Championship Points. No points were awarded for shared drives. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers.

The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race, although fastest lap points were not counted. Indy 500 results did not count towards the cup. Additionally, like the Drivers&#x27; Championship, only the best six results counted towards the cup.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

* ~ No points awarded for shared drive
* 1 – Ineligible for Formula One points, because he drove with a Formula Two car.

=== International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings ===
*Bold results counted to championship totals.

 No points were awarded for a shared drive.

==Non-championship races==
The following races were contested by Formula One cars but did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers or the International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers.

<doc id="1140111" wikidata="Q69047" url="?curid=1140111" title="1957 Formula One season">
<text>The 1957 Formula One season was the 11th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 8th World Championship of Drivers which was contested over eight races between 13 January and 8 September 1957. The season also included nine non-championship races for Formula One cars.

Juan Manuel Fangio driving for Maserati won his fourth consecutive championship. It was his fifth in total, a record that would not be beaten until Michael Schumacher in . Especially in the latter half of the season, Stirling Moss was Fangio&#x27;s main rival, but the Brit would finish runner-up for the third year in a row.

Excluding the Indianapolis 500, which counted towards the F1 championship although there was very little overlap in contestants, every race was won by a constructor with their own engine. This would not happen again until .

Three Formula One drivers lost their lives this year while racing in other categories. On 14 March, Ferrari driver Eugenio Castellotti suffered a fatal accident when he tested a new chassis for the team at Modena Autodrome. Trying to beat the lap record by Maserati&#x27;s Jean Behra, he hit a chicane in a bad way and was thrown out of the car. A skull fracture caused his instant death. On 12 May, Ferrari lost another driver: Alfonso de Portago was competing in that year&#x27;s Mille Miglia when his tire blew and his car spun into the crowd. De Portago was killed along with his co-driver and nine spectators. Herbert MacKay-Fraser made his debut with BRM in the French Grand Prix but was killed a week later in a sports car race at Reims-Gueux.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1957 World Championship of Drivers. The list does not include those who only contested the Indianapolis 500.
* Pink background denotes F2 entrants to the German Grand Prix

===Team and driver changes===
* After a year and a half at Mercedes and a season at Ferrari, reigning champion Juan Manuel Fangio returned to his team, Maserati.
* After introducing their first own chassis in the 1956 British Grand Prix, British Racing Motors entered three races in 1957, ahead of their first full-time season in .
* Gordini withdrew from Formula One after . Many of their drivers, most notably Robert Manzon, had been involved with the team for multiple years but would quit the sport as well.
* Scuderia Ferrari brought back one of their drivers, Mike Hawthorn.

====Mid-season changes====
* After the season opener in Argentina, Stirling Moss moved from Maserati to Vanwall, who had not competed in the first race. He was joined by Tony Brooks, in his first full season.
* Between the first and second race of the season, Ferrari driver Eugenio Castellotti suffered a fatal accident in testing. Teammate Cesare Perdisa retired from the sport in reaction to the loss. Just two months later, Ferrari lost another driver, Alfonso de Portago, when he crashed in that year&#x27;s Mille Miglia. The team brought back one of their drivers, Maurice Trintignant.
* Ex-Vanwall driver Harry Schell joined Maserati from the second race on.
* From the French Grand Prix on, Stuart Lewis-Evans joined Vanwall.
* After a couple of entries in previous years, Cooper increased their operations to full-time during the season. They signed future champion Jack Brabham and ex-Gilby driver Roy Salvadori, among others.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* Three rounds on the provisional calendar were cancelled due to the Suez Crisis: the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 June, the Dutch Grand Prix on 16 June and the Spanish Grand Prix on 20 October. The Dutch Grand Prix had been cancelled in 1956 as well. The Pescara Grand Prix was added to the 1957 calendar as a replacement.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Reims-Gueux to Rouen-Les-Essarts for a year.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone Circuit to Aintree Motor Racing Circuit, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.

==Championship report==

Fangio chose to switch teams again, joining Maserati before the start of the season. The decision to switch proved to be a masterstroke, with Ferrari&#x27;s line-up of Peter Collins, Eugenio Castellotti and the returning Mike Hawthorn failing to win a race. Castellotti and Alfonso de Portago were killed during the season (neither in Formula One crashes), making this a truly disastrous year for Ferrari.

The man Fangio replaced at Maserati, Stirling Moss, moved to Vanwall, a team beginning to fulfill their promise. Between them, Fangio and Moss won every championship race of the season except the Indianapolis 500, with Fangio taking four victories to Moss&#x27; three. Fangio&#x27;s drive at the Nürburgring, where he overtook Collins and Hawthorn on the penultimate lap after a pit stop had put him nearly a minute behind, is regarded as a particularly notable one.

At the end of the year, it was announced Fangio would not return for another season. Maserati also pulled out, citing financial reasons. This was also the final year in which points were awarded for shared drives.

===Race 1: Argentina===
The first race of the season was in January at the Buenos Aires Autodrome in Argentina&#x27;s capital city. Briton Moss took pole ahead of Fangio, Behra, and Ferrari drivers Castellotti, Collins, Musso, and Hawthorn. At the start of the race, Behra took the lead from Fangio and Castellotti. Moss was taken by surprise, and a juddering start damaged the throttle mechanism, and he pitted at the end of the first lap. While Moss sat in the pits, Castellotti led but was then overtaken by Behra. Soon afterwards, Collins worked his way to the front, but within a few laps, he was in trouble with his clutch and had to pit. This left Behra in the lead again, but Fangio soon passed him. Castelotti had lost his third position after a spin, so now Hawthorn was leading the charge, although both he and Musso would retire after a while with clutch problems. Castellotti remained the only challenge to the Maseratis at the front, but his race ended when a wheel fell off with 24 laps to go. Menditeguy and Schell were promoted to third and fourth when Castellotti went out, so Maserati started the season by romping home with a 1-2-3-4 result, with Fangio winning his 4th Argentine Grand Prix in a row ahead of Behra.

Argentina &#x27;57 would be Castellotti&#x27;s last Grand Prix. He was killed testing a Ferrari at the Modena Aerodrome in March. A non-championship race was held in Syracuse on the southern Italian island of Sicily; Peter Collins won this race for Ferrari. The Pau Grand Prix, held on the city streets of the southwestern French town of Pau, was won by home favourite Behra in a Maserati, while on the same day, the Glover Trophy at the Goodwood circuit in southern England was won by Briton Stuart Lewis-Evans in a Connaught-Alta. Six days after these two events, Collins won the Naples Grand Prix. Another works Ferrari driver, Spaniard Alfonso de Portago, was killed in May while contesting the Mille Miglia sportscar race in Italy for Ferrari.

===Race 2: Monaco===
Four months after the Argentine round and several non-championship races, the teams assembled in Monaco for the second championship round of the season. Moss had joined Vanwall from Maserati, driving a car designed by Colin Chapman and financed by Tony Vandervell, a wealthy British industrialist, leaving Fangio as the undisputed team leader at Maserati. Fangio took pole position. However, Moss took the lead at the first corner with Fangio behind him, but on the second lap, Collins got ahead of the Argentine driver. Moss went off and crashed at the chicane on lap 4, and Collins swerved to avoid the crash and ended up hitting a stone wall. Fangio managed to get through without a problem, and Brooks braked hard only to be rammed from behind by Hawthorn. Only Brooks could keep going, but he was five seconds behind Fangio by the time he was up to speed again. Von Trips was third, with Menditeguy fourth and Schell fifth. Menditeguy would have to stop early for new tyres after hitting a curb, so Schell moved to fourth until his suspension broke. Brabham was next in the little Cooper with Trintignant chasing him, but the Frenchman soon dropped away with a stop to cure a misfire. After several retirements, Australian Jack Brabham was up to third, but a fuel pump failure left him to push the car to the line. He was classified sixth, and Fangio won again ahead of Brooks, Masten Gregory in a Maserati, Lewis-Evans, and Trintignant.

===Race 4: France===
The Indianapolis 500 was the 3rd round of the championship, but since that race was not run to Formula One rules, no competitors who raced in Formula One raced at the Indy 500, and vice versa. The Belgian and Dutch Grands Prix, scheduled for 2 and 16 June, were both cancelled because of disputes over money affected by the Suez crisis in Egypt. This resulted in a six-week break between Monaco and the French GP, which was to be held at the Rouen-Les-Essarts public road circuit in northern France, extended from its previous layout used in 1952.

In practice, Fangio was fastest, with Behra and Musso alongside on the front row. Behind them were Schell and Collins, with the third row consisting of Salvadori, Hawthorn, and Trintignant. Behra went into the lead at the start, but Musso soon got ahead. Fangio followed in third, with Collins and Schell giving chase. Then came a fast-starting McKay-Fraser. Fangio worked his way past Behra on the second lap and took Musso for the lead on lap four. BRM suffered a setback when Flockhart seriously damaged his car in a high-speed accident, although he himself was not hurt. Collins worked his way past Behra, and the order remained unchanged at the front all the way to the flag, with Fangio winning from Musso and Collins. Behra slipped behind Hawthorn, allowing the Englishman to give the Lancia-Ferraris a 2-3-4 finish behind Fangio. McKay-Fraser&#x27;s promising run ended with a transmission failure at one-third distance, but the American would not be seen again in Formula 1. He was to die a few days later in the annual Formula 2 race at the Reims public road circuit before the Reims Grand Prix, which Musso won in a Lancia-Ferrari.

===Race 5: Britain===
The British Grand Prix was held at the Aintree circuit in Liverpool instead of at the Silverstone circuit between London and Birmingham the previous year. The Aintree circuit was located in the middle of the horse-racing course where the famous Grand National was held. Both Vanwall drivers missed the French Grand Prix and were back in action for their home race. This was to be a landmark race for British motorsports. At the start of the race, Behra took off into the lead with Moss in hot pursuit, and the Englishman emerged ahead at the end of the lap, to the delight of the partisan crowd. Brooks was third, with Hawthorn fourth and Collins fifth. There were four British drivers in the top five positions. Then came Schell, Musso, and Fangio. Moss was able to build up his lead, but the car began to sound rough, and he pitted. Behra took the lead with Brooks behind him, but the second Vanwall driver was soon called into the pits to give his car to Moss, who re-joined in ninth position. He began to work his way through the field. Behra remained ahead, with Hawthorn unable to challenge him. Then came Lewis-Evans and Collins. Moss was quickly back up to fifth. The field was thinned out by a series of mechanical failures, including Fangio and Collins. Moss caught Lewis-Evans, but on lap 69, the whole race changed when Behra&#x27;s clutch exploded. Hawthorn ran over some of the wreckage and suffered a puncture. Lewis-Evans took the lead but was passed almost immediately by Moss. The dream of a Vanwall 1–2 was punctured when Lewis-Evans suffered a broken throttle linkage which dropped him to seventh place. Moss duly won the race, claiming the first World Championship victory for a British car. Musso was second, with Hawthorn third.

The Caen Grand Prix, another important non-championship Formula One race held in the town of Caen in northern France (further west of Rouen), held between the British and German Grands Prix, was won by Behra in a BRM.

===Race 6: Germany===
At the Nürburgring in Germany, the field was as expected, with Lancia-Ferrari fielding Mike Hawthorn, Peter Collins, and Luigi Musso and Maserati running Juan Manuel Fangio, Jean Behra, and Harry Schell in their leading cars. The field was bolstered for the first time by Formula 2 machinery, which included a trio of Porsches and various Cooper-Climaxes; the length of the circuit allowed for these cars to run alongside each other.

Pole position went to Fangio, with Hawthorn, Behra, and Collins completing the front row. Then came Brooks, Schell, and Moss. At the start, Hawthorn and Collins went into a battle for the lead, with Fangio and Behra giving chase. On the third lap, Fangio passed Collins and soon took the lead. Collins then passed Hawthorn and chased after Fangio, but the Argentine driver was edging gradually away. A slow mid-race pit stop lasting 1 minute and 18 seconds (originally supposed to be 30 seconds) dropped Fangio one minute behind the two Lancia-Ferraris, but he chased back hard, broke the lap record ten times, and passed first Collins and then Hawthorn on the penultimate lap. Fangio thus won the race and his fifth World title.

===Race 7: Pescara===

The cancellation of the Belgian and Dutch Grands Prix earlier in the season enabled the FIA to include the Coppa Acerbo Pescara Grand Prix in the World Championship for the first time, although it had been contested since 1924. It was held during the 1930s Grand Prix days of Mercedes, Auto Union, and Alfa Romeo and continued as a non-championship race throughout the 1950s. The public road circuit, the longest ever used for a Formula One race (even longer than the Nürburgring), was very dangerous. Practice was limited, and Enzo Ferrari did not bother to send cars for Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins, partly because the World Championship had already been won by Juan Manuel Fangio and partly in protest against the Italian government&#x27;s moves to ban road racing following Alfonso de Portago&#x27;s accident earlier in the year in the Mille Miglia. Luigi Musso managed to convince Ferrari to lend him a car and entered the race as a privateer.

Maserati&#x27;s Fangio set the fastest time in qualifying, with Stirling Moss second in his Vanwall. Musso was third. The second row of the 3-2-3 grid featured the Maseratis of Jean Behra and Harry Schell, while row three had Vanwall&#x27;s Tony Brooks and Stuart Lewis-Evans split by the Scuderia Centro Sud Maserati of Masten Gregory.

The weather was hot, at the start, Musso took the lead. Maserati privateer Horace Gould hit a mechanic who was slow to get off the grid. Vanwall&#x27;s challenge was blunted when Brooks retired with mechanical troubles on the first lap. Moss took the lead from Musso on lap two, but the two cars remained together. Fangio ran third, but the field thinned out quickly as the hot temperatures took their toll, with Lewis-Evans losing nearly a lap because of two tyre failures and Behra suffering an engine failure. On lap 10, Musso disappeared when his engine blew, the oil causing Fangio to have a spin which damaged one of his wheels. By the time Fangio re-joined, Moss was un-catchable. Moss&#x27;s lead was even able to stop for a drink and to have his oil topped up, and he won the race ahead of Fangio. Schell finished third, with Gregory fourth and Lewis-Evans grabbing fifth at the end of the race from the fourth Maserati factory driver Giorgio Scarlatti. The Coppa Acerbo was never again used for a Formula One championship race; the race was last held in 1961 as a sportscar race.

===Race 8: Italy===
The Italian Grand Prix at Monza was held only on the road circuit without the poorly constructed concrete banking this year, as it had caused problems for the Italian constructors the year before. The track was very like the Monza of today, although without the chicanes. Ferrari was back in action for this most important of Italian races after boycotting Pescara. So it was a three-way fight between the Lancia-Ferraris, the Maseratis, and the Vanwalls. The British cars were strong, with pole position going to Stuart Lewis-Evans with Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks alongside him. Juan Manuel Fangio put his Maserati on the outside of the 4-3-4 grid while his teammates Jean Behra and Harry Schell shared row two with Peter Collins&#x27;s Lancia-Ferrari. There were three more cars on row three with Wolfgang von Trips, Luigi Musso, and Mike Hawthorn alongside the Scuderia Centro Sud Maserati of Masten Gregory.

Although the Vanwalls went away from the grid at the front, Behra moved up to second on the first lap. Fangio attached himself to the train of cars ahead of him, and the five began to pull away from the rest of the field while indulging in a traditional Monza slipstreaming battle which saw the lead constantly changing between Moss and Behra. On lap seven, Fangio took the lead, but he was soon toppled in favour of Moss, Brooks, and then Lewis-Evans. On lap 20, Brooks dropped out of the fight with a sticking throttle. Then Lewis-Evans ran into trouble and pitted. This left Moss in the lead with Fangio and Behra behind him, although Behra would pit soon afterwards for new tyres. This moved Schell into third place, but he disappeared with an oil leak which meant that third was passed on to Collins. At two-thirds distance, Collins ran into engine trouble and pitted. This promoted Hawthorn to third, but a split fuel pipe dropped him to sixth in the closing laps, leaving third place to Von Trips.

===Season conclusion===
Three more non-championship races were held, all of which were won by Jean Behra. The BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone in England, Jean Behra won driving a BRM; the Modena Grand Prix at the Modena Aerodrome (where Eugenio Castellotti had been killed previously) and the Moroccan Grand Prix at the Ain-Diab public road circuit in Casablanca, both won in a Maserati.

All seven FIA-mandated championship races had been won by two drivers in 1957: Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio and Briton Stirling Moss. Although Moss took over an ill Tony Brooks&#x27;s car during the British Grand Prix, he won with it on the road at that event.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
All Grand Prix races were run for Formula One cars, while the Indianapolis 500 was run for USAC National Championship cars and also counted towards the 1957 USAC Championship. The ongoing Suez crisis, which affected oil tankers delivering oil to their respective countries, affected several countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain. These countries were to each have Grands Prix, but they were all cancelled because of the very high oil prices in those countries.

===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Formula 2 cars competing in Grands Prix were not eligible for Championship points. Shared drives result in shared points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position, except if the driver was deemed to have completed &quot;insufficient distance&quot; in the finishing car (e.g. Peter Collins at the British Grand Prix). If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Championship of Drivers standings===

* † Position shared between multiple drivers of the same car.
* ‡ Too few laps driven to receive points.
* Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored.
*1 – Ineligible for Formula One points because he drove a Formula Two car.

==Non-championship races==
The following Formula One races, also held in 1957, did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers.

<doc id="1140112" wikidata="Q69032" url="?curid=1140112" title="1956 Formula One season">
<text>The 1956 Formula One season was the tenth season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the seventh World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over eight races between 22 January and 2 September 1956. The season also included nine non-championship races for Formula One cars.

Juan Manuel Fangio driving for Ferrari won his third consecutive championship. It was his fourth in total, a record that would not be beaten until Michael Schumacher in . Fangio&#x27;s main rivals were his teammate Peter Collins and Maserati driver Stirling Moss.

None of the championship races were won by a British constructor. This would not happen again until .

At 29 October, veteran racer Louis Rosier crashed in a sports car race at Montlhéry. He sustained head injuries and succumbed to them three weeks later.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1956 FIA World Championship. The list does not include those who only contested the Indianapolis 500.

===Team and driver changes===
* Mercedes had withdrawn from all motorsport activities after the 1955 Le Mans disaster. Reigning champion Juan Manuel Fangio moved to Scuderia Ferrari, which had taken over the assets from Lancia. Fangio would go on to win the championship in the Lancia D50. Besides remaining driver Eugenio Castellotti, the squad was completed by Luigi Musso and Peter Collins, both coming from Maserati.
* Stirling Moss, runner-up and Fangio&#x27;s teammate at Mercedes, had moved to rival team Maserati.
* Maurice Trintignant moved from Ferrari to Vanwall to replace Ken Wharton.

====Mid-season changes====
* Paco Godia joined the Maserati team from the Belgian Grand Prix on.
* Alfonso de Portago made his debut when he joined Scuderia Ferrari from the French Grand Prix on.
* Also at the French Grand Prix, Colin Chapman made his F1 racing debut with Vanwall but crashed into his team leader during practice and did not start the race. It would be his only race entry, but he would go on to become a legendary race engineer.
* And finally in France, Bugatti made a one-off appearance with their Type 251 driven by Maurice Trintignant.
* For the first time since , BRM used their own chassis, which made its debut at the British Grand Prix. It was also the championship debut for driver Tony Brooks.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Swiss Grand Prix was removed from the calendar after the Swiss Government banned motor racing as a result of the 1955 Le Mans disaster. The French Grand Prix and the German Grand Prix were already cancelled in 1955, but were back on the calendar for 1956.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was supposed to have been held on 17 June but was cancelled due to the Suez Crisis. The Spanish Grand Prix, like the French and German rounds, was supposed to return to the calendar, to be held on 28 October, but was cancelled due to the Suez Crisis.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Aintree Motor Racing Circuit to Silverstone Circuit, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 3===
Argentinian racing driver Juan Manuel Fangio had already won three Formula One World Championships, while driving for three different constructors. Now he was aiming to make it four in four: after his previous employer Mercedes had withdrawn, he moved to Scuderia Ferrari for 1956. The first race of the season was his home race, the Argentine Grand Prix, and he managed to take pole position in front of the adoring crowd. Teammates Eugenio Castellotti and Luigi Musso started alongside him on the front row. Behind them came a series of Maserati, with the whole field consisting of just thirteen cars, all of them Italian. At the start, sixth-starting Argentinian Carlos Menditeguy managed to take the lead, ahead of teammate Stirling Moss. Fangio was able to follow until his fuel pump broke on lap 21. Musso was called into the pits to give his car to the team leader, but Fangio spun off and was almost lapped by Menditeguy. The latter, however, spun off in sympathy and retired on the spot. Fangio made an inspiring recovery drive until he was in second place and, on lap 70, took the lead when his teammate Moss&#x27;s engine failed. He won the race, but received half the points because of the shared drive, ahead of Frenchman Jean Behra and Brit Mike Hawthorn.

As it had been since the inclusion of the Argentine Grand Prix on the calendar, there was a four-month gap to the second race in the championship, the Monaco Grand Prix. Constructors Vanwall, BRM and Gordini attended, but it was Fangio who once again started on pole, ahead of Moss and Castellotti. It was Moss who reached the hairpin first and quickly extended his lead, with the Ferrari trio of Fangio, Collins and Castellotti in pursuit. Suddenly, Fangio spun and ended up facing the wrong way. Hurrying to turn round, he got in the way of Luigi Musso and Harry Schell, who avoided the Ferrari but in doing so, both crashed out. Like in Argentina, Fangio made an impressive recovery drive up to second place. But through the narrow streets of Monte Carlo, there is little margin for error and the reigning champion tapped a wall, bent his rear wheel and retreated into the pits. But again, like in Argentina, he received the car of a teammate - Collins sacrificed his second place - so he could continue. From almost being lapped by Moss, he pressed on to get within six seconds of the lead, but could not stop the Brit from taking his second career victory. Behra finished third, a lap down.

The Indianapolis 500 was included in the Formula One championship, but no active drivers attended. Former champion Nino Farina did, but he failed to qualify. Pat Flaherty won the race.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jean Behra (Maserati) was leading with 10 points, ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio (Scuderia Ferrari) on 9 and Stirling Moss (Maserati) and Pat Flaherty (winner of the Indianapolis 500) on 8.

===Rounds 4 to 6===
The Belgian Grand Prix began with a tense qualifying battle, in which the Maseratis and Ferraris seemed evenly matched, until Juan Manuel Fangio set a lap that was more than ten seconds under the lap record and almost five seconds faster than his closest competitor. However, as it had happened already two times this year, the reigning champion fell back at the race start. Stirling Moss (Maserati) and Peter Collins (Ferrari) had started next to Fangio on the front row and led away. Moss was leading over six seconds before Fangio recovered to second place, but after nine laps, it was the Argentinian leading the Brit by the same distance. Things took a turn when Moss&#x27;s left rear wheel came off and Castellotti retired with a broken transmission. Moss took over the car from one of his teammates but was over a lap down, while Fangio was setting multiple lap records. Collins was in second place, until on lap 24, the leader&#x27;s Ferrari suddenly came to a halt at the far end of the circuit, providing no opportunity for a car swap in the pit. So Collins won the race, ahead of teammate and local hero Paul Frère and Moss.

Fangio scored his fourth pole position in a row during the French Grand Prix, with teammates Castellotti and Collins making it an all-Ferrari front row. Two Vanwalls separated them from their main rivals, Maserati. Fangio again lost the lead at the start, but the trio of red cars did run away from the rest of the field. Moss and Schell retired and the Ferrari team even occupied five positions at the front. Schell, however, took over the car from one of his teammates, set a new lap record and managed to close up to the unsighted leaders. The green car from Britain was faster on the straight, so the Italian squad drove side-by-side to try and block him. But going into one of the hairpins, Schell managed to pass Collins and Castellotti in one move and immediately dove into Fangio&#x27;s slipstream. The reigning champion held on, however, and Schell&#x27;s valiant drive came to a halt when technical issues forced a pit stop. On lap 40, Fangio also pitted with a split fuel line. It seemed not one race was going smoothly this year. Collins was carefree as he scored his second win in a row, ahead of teammate Castellotti and Frenchman Jean Behra.

The British Grand Prix saw three local drivers qualify on the front row, which the wide Silverstone circuit allowed to consist of four cars: Moss, Fangio, Hawthorn (BRM) and Collins. The BRM seemed the odd one out, even more so when he took the lead at the start and was closely followed by his teammate Brooks. Fangio got past into second place on lap six, but in an attempt to catch the leader, he spun off and fell back to fifth. Moss was the next to pass Brooks for second and managed to get Hawthorn on lap 16. Both BRMs then sadly retired, as did fellow Brit Salvadori, who was running second at one stage, and Collins. When Moss pitted for motor oil, Fangio closed right up, and when the Brit pitted again due to his engine losing power, there was nothing left to stop the Argentinian from winning. In second came Collins, who had taken over the car from one of his teammates, and in third came Behra.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Peter Collins (Ferrari) was leading with 22 points, ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio (Ferrari) with 21 and Jean Behra (Maserati) with 18.

===Rounds 7 and 8===
After an exhilarating British Grand Prix with lots of local drivers, no British teams entered the German Grand Prix. So the grid consisted of the Italian Ferraris and Maseratis, and a few French Gordinis at the back. Juan Manuel Fangio qualified on pole position, three tenths ahead of rival and teammate Peter Collins. Once again, Fangio lost the lead at the start, but he retook it later in the opening lap. Stirling Moss started fourth in his Maserati but overtook Ferrari&#x27;s Eugenio Castellotti. The leading trio got into a rhythm in which they focussed on finishing the race instead of fighting. They all broke the lap record that was set in 1939. Collins suddenly pitted, he was barely conscious at the wheel. After examining the car, they figured that a leaking fuel line had sent fumes into the cockpit. Collins recovered quickly and took over the car from one of his teammates. But trying everything to catch the leaders, he spun off the track. Fangio won the race quite comfortably, ahead of Moss and Jean Behra. The Frenchman was not in the spotlights but this fifth podium of the year brought him to a shared second place in the championship.

Collins was trailing Fangio by 8 points and the only way for him to win the championship, was to win the Italian Grand Prix and for Fangio to score three points or less, because then his result would not count towards the championship. This scenario would end in both men equalling on 30 points, but Collins winning on countback. The extra point for a fastest lap could make a big difference as well. Future race winner Wolfgang von Trips made his debut with the Ferrari team, but he crashed in practice while doing around . He was thrown out and escaped with scratches and bruises, but the car was a complete wreck. The Ferrari team accepted it as the cost of a young driver in a fast car and were blind to the fact that it was caused by a tyre blowout. Fangio scored his sixth pole of the year, ahead of teammates Castellotti and Musso. It might not have surprised anyone, but Fangio lost the lead at the start, this time to both his teammates, who decided to have a personal battle and completely overlook any team tactics. Harry Schell managed to put his Vanwall ahead of Fangio, putting the championship leader close to Moss and Collins. After just five laps, the fierce fighting led to tyre troubles for the leading pair and they both pitted. Castellotti would have another puncture on lap 10, this time crashing out on the steep Monza banking. Schell, Moss and Fangio were released and for the next six laps, there was nothing between them. Collins pitted for new tyres, but the championship leader retired with a broken right front suspension. Moss managed to overtake Schell and grew a big lead, so when Collins came in for another tyre change, he gave his car to Fangio in a gesture of great sportsmanship. A win at Monza would mean so much to the Ferrari team, so he granted his teamleader the opportunity to try and catch the Maserati. Moss pitted twice, bringing him very close to Fangio, but in similar fashion to Monaco, Moss won with a six seconds lead over Fangio. Ron Flockhart took advantage of all the tyre troubles and finished third in his Connaught.

Juan Manuel Fangio (Ferrari) had gathered 30 points and was awarded the 1956 Drivers&#x27; Championship. Stirling Moss (Maserati) finished second on 27 points, Peter Collins (Ferrari) third on 25.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in shared points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position, however, if both cars driven in a shared drive finished in a points-scoring position, only the highest finishing position would count. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Championship of Drivers standings===

* † Position shared between multiple drivers of the same car
* Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored.

==Non-championship races==

<doc id="1140113" wikidata="Q69015" url="?curid=1140113" title="1955 Formula One season">
<text>The 1955 Formula One season was the ninth season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the sixth World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over seven races between 16 January and 11 September 1955. The season also included several non-championship races for Formula One cars.

Juan Manuel Fangio won his second consecutive World Championship title, his third in total. This was the last championship for a Mercedes driver until 2014.

The season was coloured by tragedy. Two drivers were killed during the 1955 Indianapolis 500: Manny Ayulo and Bill Vukovich, winner of the two previous editions. Italian Mario Alborghetti died at the non-championship Pau Grand Prix. Alberto Ascari, World Champion of and , was killed while testing a Ferrari 750 Monza at Monza. And ex-Formula One driver Pierre Levegh was killed in the 1955 Le Mans disaster, along with 83 spectators. This would lead to the cancellation of four F1 Grands Prix.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1955 FIA World Championship. The list does not include those who only contested the Indianapolis 500.

===Team and driver changes===
* Stirling Moss moved from Maserati to Mercedes, like Juan Manuel Fangio had done already during the 1954 season.
* Maserati hired Jean Behra from Gordini, after which the French team reunited with Robert Manzon, their driver from and the years before.
* Vanwall hired Mike Hawthorn from Ferrari, so Peter Collins moved to Owen Racing Organisation, which would later become British Racing Motors.
* Lancia had made their debut at the end of and entered the 1955 season with full-time ambitions. They were able to hire top-class drivers Alberto Ascari, Luigi Villoresi and Eugenio Castellotti.

====Mid-season changes====
* Maserati driver Sergio Mantovani lost a leg in a crash during practice for the non-championship Valentino Grand Prix. The team hired Cesare Perdisa, who finished third on his debut.
* Peter Collins had been driving a Maserati 250F for Owen Racing Organisation when Maserati&#x27;s team leader, impressed with his results, offered him a seat at the works team, starting at the Italian Grand Prix. However, Collins parted with the team after just one race, as Ferrari offered him a seat for .
* André Simon substituted for Mercedes driver Karl Kling in the Monaco Grand Prix.
* Double World Champion Alberto Ascari lost his life while testing a Ferrari 750 Monza at Monza. Along with serious financial troubles, this led to Lancia&#x27;s team owner to halt operations and hand all assets to Enzo Ferrari. Ferrari brought back Mike Hawthorn to drive, after the Brit had spent half a year with Vanwall.
* The 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans did not only see tragedy during the race: in Friday practice, Élie Bayol (driving in F1 for Gordini) had to avoid two spectators crossing the road. This caused him to have a severe crash, suffering a fractured skull and broken vertebrae. He was out of racing for the rest of the year, so the Gordini team hired sports car and rally driver Hermano da Silva Ramos.
* Gordini&#x27;s team manager Jean Lucas took the wheel in the Italian Grand Prix, because Robert Manzon was unavailable.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Monaco and Dutch Grand Prix returned to the calendar after they had been run for the last time in and , respectively.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Aintree, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.

====Cancelled rounds====
In the aftermath of the 1955 Le Mans disaster, it was decided to reschedule the French Grand Prix from 3 July to 25 September. It was later cancelled, along with the German, Swiss and Spanish rounds.

The circuits at Pedralbes and Bremgarten were never used again for racing. Motor racing was banned altogether in Switzerland until the 2018 Zürich ePrix.

==Championship report==

===Rounds 1 to 3===

For the third year in a row, the championship opened with the Argentine Grand Prix. José Froilan González started on pole position. The Argentine had been a full-time Ferrari driver in , but it would be his only race this year. Next to him on the front row started two double World Champions: Alberto Ascari in the Lancia and Juan Manuel Fangio in the Mercedes. Fangio took the lead at the start, but lost it to Ascari on lap 3. Teammate Stirling Moss went from eighth to third, while behind them, drivers and cars were beginning to succumb to the heat of . On lap 21, Ascari crashed out by himself, leaving González in the lead. However, he was still recovering from his accident in the 1954 RAC Tourist Trophy and got exhausted. Fearing he could not hold Fangio behind, he pitted to hand the car to teammate and 1950 World Champion Nino Farina. Fangio pitted as well, for new tyres and to cool off, while Moss retired due to a vapor lock in the fuel pump. This left another local driver, Roberto Mieres in the Maserati, in the lead after starting sixteenth. Sadly, his fuel pump faltered as well and he spent 10 minutes in the pits, coming home in fifth. Besides Mieres, Fangio would be the only classified driver not to have switched cars during the race, and went on to win. Two Ferraris completed the podium, but each had seen three different drivers behind the wheel, so Fangio had an immediate lead in the championship.

The Monaco Grand Prix returned to the calendar after three years and was given the honorary title of &quot;European Grand Prix&quot;. A new rule to qualifying had been added: only the times recorded in the first practice session on Thursday afternoon would count for the front row of the grid and, thus, for pole position. The rest of the starting places would be decided by the remaining sessions on Friday and Saturday morning. This was done to entice spectators to come and watch every session, but it was an unpopular idea with the drivers. Fangio set the fastest time, ahead of Ascari and Moss, so they could relax and use the remaining sessions to try out car set-ups for the race. At the start of the race, Fangio held on to the lead, but Ascari fell back. Moss took second place after a few laps and was slowly closing up to his teammate in front. After the two drivers behind Moss pitted, Ascari was left in a lonely third place until, at half-distance, Fangio stopped on track with a broken transmission and, on lap 81, Moss&#x27;s engine blew up. Ascari took the unexpected lead of the race, but mere seconds later, crashed coming out of the harbour chicane and plunged into the water. He was lucky to escape with just a cut on the nose. Maurice Trintignant took the win for Ferrari, the first of his career, ahead of Eugenio Castellotti for Lancia and Cesare Perdisa in Jean Behra&#x27;s Maserati.

The Indianapolis 500 was included in the Formula One championship, but no F1 drivers attended. Bob Sweikert won the race.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Maurice Trintignant (Ferrari) was leading with 11formula_1 points, ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio (Mercedes) with 10 and Bob Sweikert (Kurtis Kraft) with 8. Sweikert would not compete in any other rounds.

===Rounds 4 to 6===

Four days after the Monaco Grand Prix, double World Champion Alberto Ascari was tragically killed in a test session at Monza. Further burdened by financial troubles, the Lancia team was left with two cars and just one driver. Soon, all assets would be merged into the Ferrari team, but this did not stop Eugenio Castellotti from scoring his first career pole position in the Belgian Grand Prix. The Mercedes cars of Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss started beside him on the front row. Championship leader Maurice Trintignant started down in eleventh out of thirteen. At the start, Fangio and Moss quickly took the lead and never looked back. Castellotti retired on lap 16, allowing 1950 World Champion Nino Farina to finish third for Ferrari.
On 11 June, the 24 Hours of Le Mans took place and many F1 drivers participated. During the race, Pierre Levegh crashed into the spectator area, killing 83 people and injuring at least 120 others. This led the FIA to postpone the French Grand Prix. However, the Dutch Grand Prix was next on the F1 championship and went on undisturbed. Mercedes managed to occupy the front row with Fangio, Moss and Karl Kling. At the start, Luigi Musso put his Maserati into second position, but was outbraved by Moss. Kling tried his best to keep up with the leading trio but, on lap 21, spun off and retired. Fangio and Moss scored another one-two finish, a minute ahead of Musso. This was the first race since the 1950 French Grand Prix that none of the cars on the podium were powered by a Ferrari engine.

For the British Grand Prix, Stirling Moss scored his first career pole position in front of his home crowd. Fangio started second, Jean Behra third for Maserati. The second row was filled by two more Mercedes: Karl Kling and Piero Taruffi. Fangio had the best start, but Moss regained the lead on lap 3, his car set up with a lower top speed but better acceleration out of the corners. Behra retired on lap 10, handing the top four positions to Mercedes, with Fangio once again in front. A couple of laps later, Moss retook the lead, grew his advantage to ten seconds and set a new lap record. Unused to having the team leader behind him, Moss looked back on the last lap and hesitated. But Fangio hang back, two tenths behind, leaving the home hero to take the win.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Juan Manuel Fangio (Mercedes) led with 33 points, ahead of Stirling Moss (Mercedes) with 22 and Maurice Trintignant (Ferrari) with 11formula_1 points. After the British Grand Prix, the German, Swiss, French and Spanish Grand Prix were cancelled, in the aftermath of the 1955 Le Mans disaster. This left just one race in the championship and effectively handed the title to Fangio.

===Round 7===
The Italian Grand Prix was run on the Monza layout including a new steep banking. Nino Farina crashed in practice when his rear tyre came apart under the load of the banked turn and the heat of the sun. He escaped unhurt but his Ferrari-run Lancia was written off, and although Sunday was substantially cooler, the other Lancia was withdrawn as a precaution. Like in Zandvoort, Mercedes-Benz in Formula One#Mercedes occupied the front row in the order of Fangio, Moss, Kling. Moss took the lead at the start, but gave way to his Argentinian team leader before the first lap was run. The fourth Mercedes of Taruffi went from ninth to fourth, the team repeating their procession run from last race. However, Moss pitted on lap 19 for a new windscreen and subsequently retired on lap 28 when his engine cut out. Kling&#x27;s gearbox broke and he retired as well, leaving the German team worried, but Fangio and Taruffi finished the race untroubled, scoring another Mercedes 1–2, ahead of Eugenio Castellotti for Ferrari.

Juan Manuel Fangio (Mercedes) had collected 40 points and won his third Drivers&#x27; Championship, his second in a row. Teammate Stirling Moss was second with 23 points and Eugenio Castellotti third with 12. Mercedes withdrew from F1 after this season, marking it the final race until the team&#x27;s revival in 2010, their final win until the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix and final championship title until .

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in shared points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Championship of Drivers standings===
* † Position shared between multiple drivers of the same car.

==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One races were also held in 1955, which did not count towards the World Championship.

<text>The 1954 Formula One season was the eighth season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the fifth World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over nine races between 17 January and 24 October 1954. The season also included several non-championship races for Formula One cars.

Juan Manuel Fangio won his second Drivers&#x27; Championship, after previously winning it in . After the first couple of races, he switched teams, going from Maserati to Mercedes-Benz, making him the only F1 driver in history to win a championship driving for more than one team in the same season.

After the championship had been run under Formula Two regulations for two seasons, the maximum engine displacement was increased to 2.5 litres for 1954. This increased average power outputs by 150% and attracted several new constructors. At the same time, some F2 constructors withdrew, while others intended to compete but could not get an F1 chassis ready in time.

Argentinian Onofre Marimón suffered a fatal accident during practice for the German Grand Prix. Coming over one of the steep hills, he went straight through the corner at the bottom. His Maserati hit a ditch, somersaulted and landed on top of him. It was the first fatality during an F1 championship weekend.

In 1955, the movie The Racers came out, the story of which was based on the life of Rudolf Caracciola. Real-life racing footage from the 1954 F1 season was used, including in-race shots from a camera car that started behind the drivers in the Belgian Grand Prix. This approach would be recreated in the 1966 film Grand Prix.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1954 FIA World Championship of Drivers. The list does not include those who only contested the Indianapolis 500.

===Team and driver changes===

* Cooper and Connaught did not enter with their works team, because they could not get a car prepared in time that adhered to the new regulations.
* HWM did build an F1 chassis, but it lacked pace. Driver Lance Macklin only entered one championship round and retired with engine failure.
* Veritas, OSCA and AFM withdrew from the championship because of the changed regulations.
* Over the winter, Maserati had lost their driver Felice Bonetto when he suffered a fatal accident in the 1953 Carrera Panamericana. First Prince Bira and then Sergio Mantovani took over the drive.
* After winning two consecutive championships with the team, Alberto Ascari left Ferrari over a salary dispute to join newcomers Lancia. Teammate and personal mentor Luigi Villoresi made the same change. The team hired Maurice Trintignant from Gordini.
* Gordini hired Élie Bayol, who had driven for OSCA in alongside Louis Chiron, so Harry Schell competed in a private Maserati.

====Mid-season changes====

* Unable to get their cars ready any sooner, Mercedes joined the championship from the French Grand Prix on. Juan Manuel Fangio left Maserati to join the German squad, alongside Karl Kling and Hans Herrmann.
* At the same race, British Racing Motors, under the name of &quot;Owen Racing Organisation&quot;, returned to the sport, having done a one-off race in . It would be the start of their 24-years involvement in the championship.
* Vanwall made their debut in the British Grand Prix with ex-HWM driver Peter Collins. Their chassis was prepared by Cooper.
* Lancia joined the championship as well, but could only manage to prepare their car for the last race of the season. Drivers Alberto Ascari and Luigi Villoresi were loaned to Maserati and Ferrari in the meantime.
* Élie Bayol was fired from Gordini after he refused to let team leader Jean Behra take his car during the non-championship Bordeaux Grand Prix.
* champion Nino Farina became Ferrari&#x27;s team leader when Ascari left. However, on 27 June, he suffered a crash in the 1954 Supercortemaggiore Grand Prix, a sports car race at Monza, due to which he had to spend 20 days in hospital and did not return to F1 for the rest of the year.
* After Onofre Marimón suffered his fatal accident, countryman Roberto Mieres and Brit Stirling Moss, who had both been racing Maseratis under their own name, were promoted to the Maserati works team.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Spanish Grand Prix at Pedrables returned to the calendar for the first time since . It was cancelled in the past two years due to monetary reasons.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was originally scheduled to be held on 6 June but was cancelled due to monetary reasons.

==Regulation changes==
The maximum allowed engine displacement was increased from 2.0 to 2.5 litres for naturally-aspirated engines. Average power outputs increased by around 150%. The limit for compressed engines was set at 750 cc, as it had been since , but no constructor would build one before they were outright banned in .

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 3===

The championship started off with the Argentine Grand Prix. Multiple constructors intended to compete, but none of their cars were ready yet. The grid consisted of Ferraris, Maseratis and Gordinis, all of them adapting their chassis for the new regulations. &#x27;s champion Nino Farina qualified on pole position - he is the oldest F1 driver in history to start on pole - ahead of teammate José Froilán González and local hero Juan Manuel Fangio in the Maserati. At the start, González fell back to fourth, but after a remarkable recovery drive, he took the lead on lap 15. A third of the way in, a rainstorm arrived and the leader spun off. Farina pitted for a new helmet visor and third Ferrari driver Mike Hawthorn spun off as well. This left Fangio in a comfortable lead, until the track dried and he fell back to third behind González and Farina. A second period of rain caused the order to switch back around, putting Fangio ahead of the two Ferraris, but when the Maserati driver pitted for new tyres, he was back in third. Ferrari&#x27;s team manager Nello Ugolini protested his rivals&#x27; pit stop, claiming they had too many mechanics working on the car. Confident that the protest would be granted, he signalled the leading pair to bring the cars home and not fight the charging Fangio. So they did, and they finished second and third behind the home hero. But then the FIA rejected Ferrari&#x27;s protest and upheld the results, granting Fangio his first home win.

The Indianapolis 500 was included in the Formula One championship, but no F1 drivers attended. Bill Vukovich won the race for the second year in a row.

In qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, Fangio broke his lap record and started on pole position, ahead of González and Farina. The Argentine was contracted by Mercedes, but since their car was not ready yet, he was loaned to his former team. González was allowed into the lead when Fangio messed up the start, but when his engine cut out on the opening lap, Farina was in front. Roberto Mieres&#x27;s car burst into flames, as his fuel filler cap had been left open and fuel had leaked onto the exhaust. The Maserati driver jumped out, escaping with burns on his back, and the drivers avoided his car. Fangio got up to second place by lap 2 and took the lead on lap 3. When his helmet visor broke on lap 10, he pitted to put on his goggles, but then recovered to pass Farina for the second time, just before the Ferrari engine cut out, sending the Italian out of the race. Hawthorn&#x27;s exhaust pipe split, sending fumes into the cockpit and making him feel dizzy. He pitted and collapsed over the wheel, so the team dragged him out and González took over his car. The team only found out why the Brit was unwell when González pointed it out a lap later. Fangio took a comfortable win, ahead of Maurice Trintignant (Ferrari) and Stirling Moss (Maserati).

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Juan Manuel Fangio (Maserati/Mercedes) was in the lead with 17 points, ahead of Maurice Trintignant (Ferrari) and Bill Vukovich (Kurtis Kraft) with 8. Vukovich would not compete in any other rounds.

===Rounds 4 to 7===

The long-awaited Mercedes team arrived for the French Grand Prix and their drivers were quickest of all from the get-go. Championship leader Juan Manuel Fangio could finally say goodbye to Maserati and was joined by Germans Karl Kling and Hans Herrmann. Fangio&#x27;s seat was taken up by and champion Alberto Ascari, whose new employer Lancia did not have their cars ready yet. Teammate and mentor Luigi Villoresi was loaned to Maserati likewise. Fangio and Kling set the fastest times in qualifying, putting their silver-coloured streamlined W196s at the front of the grid. In the opening laps, González was the only one to stay with the leading pair, but his Ferraris overheated, so his focus shifted to keeping the third Mercedes of Herrmann behind. On lap 13, the Ferrari engine gave up. Teammate Mike Hawthorn retired with similar issues, before Herrmann broke the lap record but then stopped in a cloud of smoke. Fangio and Kling did their laps at a comfortable pace, most straights running side-by-side, only upping their pace for the final sprint. Coming out of the last corner, Fangio managed to take the win by just a couple of yards. Robert Manzon in a private Ferrari finished third out of just six finishers.

Fangio was again at pole position for the British Grand Prix, but the Mercedes&#x27; streamlined bodywork gave them less of an advantage at the Silverstone Circuit, compared to Reims two weeks ago. The Ferraris of González and Hawthorn, and the private Maserati of Stirling Moss completed the four-wide front row. González took the lead at the start and created a gap of some five seconds, while Moss and Hawthorn were in a fierce fight. Rain fell and there were several accidents. Fangio went off and damaged the nose of his car, but kept putting pressure on his countryman in front, until his pace was hindered by technical trouble and he fell back to fourth. González scored a win to be proud of, ahead of Ferrari teammate Hawthorn and Onofre Marimón for Maserati, as with 10 laps to go, Moss&#x27;s back axle had failed. Fangio finished fourth on a lap down. Seven drivers set the fastest lap, as it was not measured any more precise than in whole seconds, so they all received an extra formula_1 championship point.
The German Grand Prix was given the honorary title of &quot;Grand Prix of Europe&quot;. Four Mercedes cars arrived, with three of them carrying open-wheeled bodywork, the team seemingly having learned from their defeat in Britain. Practice was overshadowed by the fatal accident of Marimón, one of the more popular and younger drivers on the grid, and the Maserati works team withdrew from the race. Fangio scored his third pole position in a row, ahead of Hawthorn and Moss, but it was González who took the lead at the start. Hawthorn fell back behind the fast-starting Mercedes of Lang and Herrmann. Fangio passed his countryman going into lap 2 and Moss retired with dramatic technical failing. Hawthorn retired as well, giving way to the fourth Mercedes of Kling, who had started last. Herrmann retired with a fuel leak, but when González dropped off the pace, the other Mercedes were sitting in a dominant 1–2–3. Lang, however, spun off and Kling was putting unnecessary pressure on Fangio. Hawthorn took over González&#x27;s car, before Kling pitted a broken rear suspension. Fangio upheld Mercedes&#x27;s honour with a win, ahead of the two Ferraris of Hawthorn/González and Maurice Trintignant, with Kling in fourth.

Fangio had the opportunity to clinch the championship in the Swiss Grand Prix. All he had to do was prevent González from winning and his lead in points would be large enough. González started on pole but immediately lost the lead to Fangio. Moss, who had been promoted to the Maserati works team, started third and was eager to put the Ferrari another place down. Hawthorn had started down in sixth but was lapping two seconds faster than the leader, and managed to overtake both González and Moss. In quick succession, Moss, Hawthorn, Trintignant and Kling retired, removing all excitement from the race. Fangio led González home by almost a minute, while Herrmann finished a lap down.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Juan Manuel Fangio (Maserati/Mercedes) stood on 42 points and he had done enough to secure his second title. José Froilán González (Ferrari) was currently in second with 23formula_2 points and Maurice Trintignant (Ferrari) third with 15.

===Rounds 8 and 9===

Even with the championship in the bag, Juan Manuel Fangio showed no signs of slowing down going into the Italian Grand Prix. He scored another pole position for Mercedes, ahead of Alberto Ascari, now with Ferrari, since Lancia were still not ready, and Stirling Moss for Maserati. At the start, Fangio lost the lead to fourth-starting teammate Karl Kling and the &quot;Silver Arrows&quot; with their streamlined bodywork looked set to repeat their feat in Reims. However, Kling made a slight mistake on lap 5, bringing him down to fifth, and José Froilán González, second in the championship, managed to get alongside Fangio, before Ascari went passed all of them. González retired, so the old rivals Fangio and Ascari were free to fight. And so they did for more than twenty laps, until Maserati drivers Moss and Luigi Villoresi joined the scrap. The latter had overworked his clutch and soon dropped back, but Moss took the lead. Ascari suddenly retired with engine failure, which gave Moss the opportunity to stretch his lead, until on lap 68, his oil pressure dropped and he needed to pit. The oil was topped off, but on the next lap, it was streaming from the bottom of the car and he needed to retire. His teammate Sergio Mantovani had been fighting for second place with Mike Hawthorn, but that Maserati ran into trouble as well. Fangio won the race, just like last year, ahead of Hawthorn and Umberto Maglioli, who had taken over the car from González.

The season closed with the Spanish Grand Prix and Lancia joined the grid with their D50s. This meant that Ascari could finally try the car and he did so with success, scoring his first pole position of the year. The front row was completed by Fangio (Mercedes), Hawthorn (Ferrari) and Harry Schell (private Maserati). The latter took the lead at the start, ahead of Hawthorn and Ascari, while Fangio fell back to sixth. Ascari was in front on lap 3 and was drawing away, until on lap 9, his clutch gave out. Teammate Villoresi had already stopped on the first lap, so both Lancias had been quick but brittle. Maurice Trintignant joined the pack and took the lead. Moss joined as well, but before long retired with a failing oil pump. Schell spun off while leading on lap 29, and then retired with a broken gearbox, before Trintignant retired from the lead with similar issues. Hawthorn could relax and he brought his Ferrari home to win, ahead of Maserati&#x27;s Luigi Musso, who had overtaken Fangio&#x27;s Mercedes six laps from the end, to make it three different constructors on the podium.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Juan Manuel Fangio (Maserati/Mercedes) gathered 42 points and won his second title, ahead of José Froilán González (Ferrari) with 25formula_1 points and Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari) with 24formula_2.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best five results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in half points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Championship of Drivers standings===

* † Position shared between multiple drivers of the same car.
* * Fastest lap shared between multiple drivers.
* ‡ Several cars were shared in this race. See the race page for details.

<text>The 1953 Formula One season was the seventh season of the FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 4th World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over nine races between 18 January and 13 September 1953. The season also included several non-championship races and a separate East German Championship.

As in , all races counting towards the Formula One championship, except the Indianapolis 500, were held for cars complying with Formula Two regulations. A couple of non-championship races were still run under Formula One regulations.

The World Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Alberto Ascari driving for Scuderia Ferrari. Ascari became the first driver since the inception of the championship in to successfully defend his title. It would be his last title, as well as the last for any Italian driver, .

For the first time, a championship event was included outside of Europe (with the exception of the Indianapolis 500): the 1953 Argentine Grand Prix. It was marred by an accident involving 1950 champion Nino Farina, who crashed into an unprotected crowd, killing nine spectators.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1953 FIA World Championship of Drivers. The list does not include those who only contested the Indianapolis 500.

===Team and driver changes===

* After competing in just one race in , Maserati entered at least three cars in each race this year. They convinced champion Juan Manuel Fangio to return to the sport and to replace Franco Rol.
* Mike Hawthorn was offered a drive with Ferrari after displaying his talent in several non-championship races in 1952. He replaced Piero Taruffi, who took up a drive with the Lancia sports car racing team.

* From the Belgian Grand Prix on, Onofre Marimón joined Maserati as a full-time driver. José Froilán González left the team after the British Grand Prix. He would return to the grid with Ferrari in .
* Veteran racer Louis Chiron returned to F1 at the 1953 French Grand Prix with OSCA.
* After competing in the season opener, Cooper returned to the grid for the French Grand Prix, with Stirling Moss as their sole driver, after he left a part-time drive at Connaught.
* When Moss left, Prince Bira joined the Connaught team for three races.
* Peter Collins left HWM before the end of the season. He would return in with Vanwall.
* José Froilán González crashed a Lancia sports car before the German Grand Prix, got injured and was out of F1 for the rest of the season. Hermann Lang returned to Grand Prix racing after 14 years to replace him for one race, before Sergio Mantovani and Luigi Musso joined the team to make their F1 debut.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* On 18 January, the Argentine Grand Prix hosted its first World Championship Grand Prix.
* The Swiss Grand Prix was moved back from mid May to late August, while the Dutch Grand Prix was moved up from mid August to early June.
* After a year at Rouen-Les-Essarts, the French Grand Prix was moved back to Reims-Gueux.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was scheduled to be held on 26 October, but it was cancelled for monetary reasons.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 3===

The 1953 season started in Argentina, the first championship Formula One Grand Prix outside of Europe (with the exception of the Indianapolis 500). Alberto Ascari and Ferrari had dominated , but Juan Manuel Fangio, the champion returning after a year away, at the new Maserati works team were expected to put up a good fight. Ascari qualified on pole position, ahead of Fangio and Ferrari teammates Luigi Villoresi and Nino Farina. The race attracted so many spectators that they were able to break through the security parameter and sit by the track. Only the fear of a riot resisted the organisers from cancelling the race. Ascari held the lead at the start, ahead of Fangio, as the lines of people grew thicker. On lap 21, one of the Adolfo Schwelm Cruz&#x27;s Cooper lost a wheel, which bounced into the crowd, and eleven laps later, Farina spun off, crushing bodies until his Ferrari came to a halt. At least nine people were killed, which became ten when a panic ensued, a little boy ran unto the track and he was hit by the Cooper of Alan Brown. The race continued, Fangio retired with a broken transmission and Ascari finished a lap ahead of Villoresi and Maserati&#x27;s José Froilán González.

The Indianapolis 500 was included in the Formula One championship, but no F1 drivers attended. Bill Vukovich won the race for the second year in a row.
The Dutch Grand Prix, being the first round of the year in Europe, attracted no less than twenty entrants, and Maserati brought upgraded cars. Still, the starting grid looked almost the same as in Argentina: Ascari, with Fangio and Farina next to him, and Villoresi and González on the second row. At the start, Ascari took the lead, while his teammates converged on Fangio, squeezing him almost to a standstill. The three prancing horses led away unchallenged. Both González and Fangio retired with a broken rear axle. Villoresi retired when his injection failed. Ascari and Farina finished 1–2, while González managed to get third after taking over the car from a teammate.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Alberto Ascari (Ferrari) was leading with 17 points. Bill Vukovich was second with 9, but he would not enter any other races. Luigi Villoresi (Ferrari) was third with 7 points.

===Rounds 4 to 7===
The Maseratis were favourites going into the Belgian Grand Prix because of their high top speed. Juan Manuel Fangio delivered and set pole position, ahead of championship leader Alberto Ascari and teammate José Froilán González. Ascari&#x27;s Ferrari teammates Nino Farina and Luigi Villoresi occupied the second row. González took the lead at the start and the two Maseratis streaked away, until they retired with mechanical issues two laps from each other. Farina retired as well, leaving Ascari and Villoresi to finish 1–2, ahead of Onofre Marimón on his debut for Maserati.

Ascari continued his dominance with a pole position for the French Grand Prix, ahead of Maserati&#x27;s Felice Bonetto (teammate González set the qualifying time, but it was in Bonetto&#x27;s car) and Villoresi. Fangio and González stood on the second row, but the latter took the lead at the start. Farina had a good start, while Bonetto spun, so González was now under threat from a group of four Ferraris. But the Argentinian streaked away and it was Fangio who started pressuring the group from behind. At half-distance, González pitted to refuel, which explained his good pace. A tight group was formed of seven red cars, all fighting for the lead. The Ferraris were better through the corners, but the Maseratis had a higher top speed, and with two laps to go, Mike Hawthorn and Fangio were side-by-side over the line. Hawthorn managed to inch in front and won, ahead of Fangio and González.

At the British Grand Prix, the front row was divided between the two Italian teams: Ascari scored pole, ahead of González, Hawthorn and Fangio. Fangio tried to take the lead at the start, but drifted wide and Ascari went back through. Hawthorn spun off and returned to the pits for a check-up. González was in second place, before officials suspected his Maserati from losing oil and ordered him to pit. Ascari increased his lead over now-second Fangio, before rain and hail fell and the circuit flooded. A couple of drivers spun, but Ascari finished his faultless race to win, a minute ahead of Fangio and two laps ahead of Farina. Ascari and González set the same fastest lap (measured in whole seconds), so they both gained an extra half a point.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Alberto Ascari (Ferrari) was leading with 33.5 points, ahead of Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari) with 16 and José Froilán González (Maserati) with 13.5.

===Rounds 7 to 9===
Championship leader Alberto Ascari qualified on pole position for the German Grand Prix, ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio, Nino Farina and Mike Hawthorn. Fangio took the lead at the start, but Ascari was back in front after half a lap. He looked set to score his fourth win of the year, until he suddenly appeared in the pits with just three wheels. Farina took the lead, while Ascari fell back to ninth place. On lap 10, he took over the car from teammate Luigi Villoresi, suddenly bringing the championship leader back to fourth place. He set the fastest lap since Hermann Lang in 1939 but then retired with a blown engine. Farina held on to the lead and won the race, ahead of Fangio and Hawthorn.

At this point, the Spanish Grand Prix was still scheduled for 26 October, so there were three races left to go. Farina, Fangio and Hawthorn could theoretically prevent Ascari from becoming champion, but they had to win all remaining races, while setting the fastest lap in at least two of them. At the Swiss Grand Prix, Fangio scored pole position, ahead of Ascari and Farina, while Hawthorn started seventh. Ascari passed Fangio on the opening lap, while Farina fell back. On lap 10, Fangio switched cars with teammate Felice Bonetto, since the Italian&#x27;s seemed to be running better, but then Fangio had to pit again with a flat tyre, and on lap 28, dramatically retired with a blown engine. This let the recovering Farina into second place, which became the lead when Ascari&#x27;s carburetor failed and he spent 11 minutes in the pits. He rejoined in third, but such was his pace, that he passed both Hawthorn and Farina and then won over a minute ahead of Farina. Mike Hawthorn finished third to make it an all-Ferrari podium. Hermann Lang finished fifth in his first Grand Prix since 1939.
With his win in Switzerland, Ascari had big enough of a lead to secure his second consecutive title. This became even clearer when the Spanish Grand Prix was cancelled and only one race was left in the season, the Italian Grand Prix. Ascari showed no signs of slowing down and reached a record total of six pole positions in a season. He started ahead of Fangio and Farina. Fourth-placed Onofre Marimón made a good start to pass both champions ahead of him, to slot in behind the now-double champion. Like in Reims, the four leaders formed a group that lapped the rest of the field and never separated more than a car length or two from each other. Just over half-distance, Marimón pitted with a damaged radiator, so it was now a three-horse race. On the very last corner, Ascari spun off into the grass, Farina went off the track to avoid him and, although the latter continued over the finish line, it let Fangio claim his first win since . Farina was second and, although Ascari retired just 200 yards from the finish, he was classified behind all cars still running, so Villoresi took third.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Alberto Ascari (Ferrari) scored 34.5 points to clinch his second consecutive title, ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio (Maserati) with 28 and Nino Farina (Ferrari) with 26.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best four results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in half points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Championship of Drivers standings===
* † Position shared between more drivers of the same car
* * Point for fastest lap shared between different drivers.
* ‡ Several cars were shared in this race. See the race page for details.

==Non-championship races==
The following Formula One/Formula Two/Formula Libre races, which did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers, were held in 1953.

===East German races===
The Bernau race was not part of the East German Championship.

===East German Championship===
The table below shows the points awarded for each race. Only East German drivers were eligible for points.

<doc id="1140116" wikidata="Q68967" url="?curid=1140116" title="1952 Formula One season">
<text>The 1952 Formula One season was the sixth season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 3rd World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over eight races between 18 May and 7 September 1952. The season also included several non-championship races and a separate East German Championship.

The Formula One championship rounds were run under Formula Two regulations out of fear for a small number of entrants.

The World Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Alberto Ascari driving for Scuderia Ferrari. The Italian won six out of the seven races he entered.

Neither British driver nor team won a championship round. This would not happen again until .

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1952 FIA World Championship of Drivers. The list does not include those that contested only the Indianapolis 500.
* Car entered only in the Indianapolis 500 race

===Team and driver changes===

* The introduction of Formula Two regulations opened the door for many new constructors (although only a few of them were works teams): AFM, Alta, Aston Butterworth, Connaught, Cooper, Frazer Nash, Veritas and several more German teams who only entered the Nürburgring race.
* Alfa Romeo were unable to fund a new car and withdrew from the sport. Reigning champion Juan Manuel Fangio moved to BRM, while champion Nino Farina moved to Ferrari.
* BRM were preparing two V16-powered cars for the season, but the project was delayed. Driver Stirling Moss moved to ERA, while Fangio waited until he drove the new BRM in June. He had entered a couple of non-championship races, before he crashed in the race at Monza and suffered a broken neck. After being treated in a Milan hospital, he spent the rest of the year recovering in Argentina.
* After one race in , HWM expanded their operations to enter the full 1952 season. Peter Collins and Lance Macklin were hired full-time, both men making their championship debuts, alongside several part-time drivers.
* Gordini driver André Simon moved to Ferrari, but only entered two championship rounds. The French team welcomed Jean Behra, who had just switched from motorcycle racing, and Thai Prince Bira.
* It took Maserati until the final round of the championship before their new chassis, compliant with the Formula Two regulations, was finished. They hired Felice Bonetto from Alfa Romeo, José Froilán González from Ferrari and Franco Rol, who had previously driven for them in .

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Dutch Grand Prix was included in the championship for the first time.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Reims-Gueux to Rouen-Les-Essarts for a year.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was scheduled to be held on 26 October but it was cancelled for monetary reasons.

==Regulation changes==
* Organisers predicted a small number of entrants for the 1952 season, so they decided that all races counting towards the Formula One championship, except for the Indianapolis 500, would be held for cars complying with Formula Two regulations. This paved the way for a more diverse field of competitors. Maximum allowed engine displacements were halved: Naturally-aspirated engines could be no larger than 2.0 L (down from 4.5) and compressed engines no larger than 750 cc (down from 1.5 L).
* Racing helmets were made mandatory.

==Championship report==

===Round 1: Switzerland===
For the second successive season, the championship&#x27;s opening round was the Swiss Grand Prix, held at the Bremgarten Circuit in Bern. Ferrari&#x27;s lead driver Ascari was absent due to his participation in the Indianapolis 500, so it was left to his teammates Nino Farina and Piero Taruffi to secure the first two places on the grid. Farina led from the start until he retired with magneto failure, leaving Taruffi to win his only championship Grand Prix and take the extra point for the fastest lap. Farina took over the car of his other teammate, Andre Simon, and was battling debutant Jean Behra for second place before both experienced mechanical trouble, Farina again unable to continue. It was, therefore, privateer Rudi Fischer who completed a Ferrari 1–2, with Jean Behra in third for Gordini. Ken Wharton finished fourth driving a Frazer-Nash, the manufacturer&#x27;s only ever points finish.

===Round 2: Indianapolis 500===
As usual, the Indianapolis 500 had little bearing on the championship result, although regular Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari did compete, retiring after 40 laps. The race was dominated by Bill Vukovich, who led 150 laps before retiring. It was left to Troy Ruttman to win the race from Jim Rathmann and Sam Hanks.

===Round 3: Belgium===
Ascari returned to Ferrari for round 3 of the championship at Spa-Francorchamps, with Maserati still absent as they developed their A6GCM. The Ferrari cars dominated the weekend, with Ascari taking pole, the race win, and the fastest lap while leading every lap bar one. He was followed home by teammate Nino Farina, and Robert Manzon finished in third for Gordini. Jean Behra again impressed as he led the opening lap before falling behind the Ferrari juggernaut and eventually retiring after an incident with the third Ferrari of Piero Taruffi.

===Round 4: France===
Scuderia Ferrari dominated once again at Rouen, taking all three podium places. Ascari led all the way from pole position to assume the championship lead and achieve his fourth career victory, drawing him level with his teammate Nino Farina who finished second. Piero Taruffi finished third after falling behind the Gordinis of Robert Manzon and Jean Behra at the start. Manzon was the highest Non-Ferrari finisher ahead of his teammate Maurice Trintignant, who drove an older model.

===Round 5: Britain===
Although Ascari again dominated, it wasn&#x27;t plain sailing for his teammates as Ferrari eventually dominated as they had done throughout the year. The Italian&#x27;s third consecutive victory strengthened his eventually successful championship challenge as his main competitor, Nino Farina, failed to score despite taking pole position. The third Ferrari of Piero Taruffi dropped down to ninth at the start but eventually recovered to take second place, while a pitstop for new spark plugs meant Farina finished in the sixth position. It was a triumphant day for British cars and drivers, with Mike Hawthorn taking his first podium driving a Cooper-Bristol, while British cars and drivers occupied the other points-paying positions.

===Round 6: Germany===
The belated arrival of the Maserati factory team failed to stop the dominance of Ferrari, with Ascari clinching his first World Title and equalling the injured Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s win record. It was his fourth consecutive victory of the season, again leading every race lap from pole position. He briefly lost the race lead to Farina after pitting for oil, but this is not reflected in the lap charts as he caught and passed his teammate before they crossed the line at the end of the lap. Farina finished second, and privateer Ferrari driver Rudi Fischer finished third ahead of the works car of Taruffi to ensure a Ferrari 1-2-3-4. Jean Behra scored the final points for Gordini just ahead of another Ferrari car, this time driven by Roger Laurent.

===Round 7: Netherlands===
Ascari started from pole position and led from start to finish, taking the fastest lap as well, winning his fifth consecutive Grand Prix and earning his second consecutive Grand Slam, and the third his season and career. In addition, with his victory, Ascari overtook Fangio as the winningest Formula One Driver, although the Argentinian would eventually reclaim the record at the 1955 Argentine Grand Prix. Further down the order, Giuseppe Farina and Luigi Villoresi, also driving for Ferrari, completed the podium, resulting in an Italian 1-2-3 and a 1-2-3 for the Scuderia. As a result, Ascari extended his championship points total to 36, extending his lead to 12 points over second-placed Farina.

===Round 8: Italy===
The 80-lap race was won by Ferrari driver Alberto Ascari after he started from pole position. José Froilán González finished second for the Maserati team and Ascari&#x27;s teammate Luigi Villoresi came in third.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===
Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best four results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in half points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Championship of Drivers standings===

* † Position shared between more drivers of the same car
* * Point for fastest lap shared between different drivers.
* Only the best four results counted towards the championship. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored.

==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One/Formula Two races, which did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers, were also held in 1952.

===East German races===
Note - a blue background denotes a round of the East German Championship.

===East German Championship===
The table below shows the points awarded for each race. Only East German drivers were eligible for points.

<doc id="1140117" wikidata="Q68955" url="?curid=1140117" title="1951 Formula One season">
<text>The 1951 Formula One season was the fifth season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the second World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over eight races between 27 May and 28 October 1951. The season also included several non-championship races for Formula One cars.

Juan Manuel Fangio won his first Drivers&#x27; Championship, beating reigning champion and Alfa Romeo teammate Nino Farina, as well as several drivers from their main rival, Ferrari. Alfa Romeo has not won any Formula One championship since.

Multiple teams, including Alfa Romeo, were running chassis from before World War II. Regulation changes for , however, would make them obsolete.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1951 FIA World Championship of Drivers. The list does not include those that only contested the Indianapolis 500.


===Team and driver changes===

* Alfa Romeo replaced their full-time driver Luigi Fagioli with Consalvo Sanesi, who had joined the team at the end of . Toulo de Graffenried also drove three races for the team, his only Grands Prix for a works team.
* Ferrari hired Piero Taruffi, who had made his F1 debut with Alfa Romeo at the end of last season, and José Froilán González, coming from a private Maserati team.
* Gordini waited until the fourth race in the calendar to compete. They added André Simon to their line-up.
* Talbot-Lago did not enter their works team for 1951. Three of their drivers decided to each take over a Talbot chassis and race it under their own name.
* Maserati, likewise, did not enter their works team. Driver Louis Chiron moved to Louis Rosier&#x27;s private Talbot team, while Franco Rol would return later in 1951 with O.S.C.A..
* HWM made their debut with drivers George Abecassis and Stirling Moss. They would only enter the season opener, before returning in .

====Mid-season changes====

* Future champions BRM made their debut in the British Grand Prix with Peter Walker and Reg Parnell. It would be their only start, before returning in .
* Luigi Fagioli made his return with Alfa Romeo in the French Grand Prix, in which the team manager ordered him to hand over his car to teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fagioli was allegedly so disappointed that he chose to retire from the sport immediately. Felice Bonetto replaced him as Alfa Romeo&#x27;s third driver, while Consalvo Sanesi left the team.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Monaco Grand Prix was dropped from the calendar due to budgetary concerns and a lack of regulations in the sport. 
* The Swiss Grand Prix was moved from June to May to become the season opener.
* The British Grand Prix was moved back from May to July.
* For the first time, the German and Spanish Grand Prix featured on the calendar as championship rounds.

==World Championship season summary==

Ferrari&#x27;s newer, naturally aspirated 4.5-litre cars offered a real challenge to the Alfas, which were nearing the end of their development potential. The Ferraris were able to capitalize on the inefficiency of the Alfa&#x27;s very thirsty engines, particularly at Silverstone. Although Alfas won four races, with Fangio taking the championship, Ferrari&#x27;s three victories spelled the end for the Alfas. BRM made their only championship appearance with the V16 at Silverstone, and the old, slow Talbots were increasingly outclassed.

Points were given to the top 5 finishers (8, 6, 4, 3, 2). One point was given for the fastest lap. Only the best four of eight scores counted towards the world championship. Points for shared drives were divided equally between the drivers, regardless of who had driven more laps.

===Pre-season non-championship races===
Although the official championship season would start in late May in Switzerland, a handful of non-championship events were to be run. The first was the first-ever Syracuse Grand Prix near the ancient city of Syracuse on the southern island of Sicily. This race was won by Italian Luigi Villoresi driving the new 4 1/2 litre Ferrari 375 on the public road circuit. Villoresi would triumph again two weeks later at Pau in southwest France over homeland hero Louis Rosier and Nino Farina, driving a Maserati for this race. On the same day, Thai driver Birabongse Bhanudej would triumph at the Richmond Trophy race at Goodwood in southern England in his Maserati.

Three weeks after the Goodwood and Pau races, it was the San Remo Grand Prix in western Italy, not far from Monaco. Alberto Ascari made his first appearance of the season and promptly won in a Ferrari 375 on this twisty and demanding street circuit, ahead of his countryman Dorino Serafini and Swiss Rudi Fischer, both in Ferraris. A week later was the Bordeaux Grand Prix in western France, and it was won by Rosier in a Talbot, ahead of Fischer and Briton Peter Whitehead in a Ferrari. Besides Farina, this race did not feature any Italians because they were competing in the Mille Miglia.

A week later was the BRDC International Trophy race at Silverstone, with the Alfa Romeos making their first appearance in 1951. Of the first two heats, Fangio won the first while Farina won the second, and Reg Parnell won the final all-important event, which was stopped because of torrential rain and flooding. Two weeks after this was the Paris Grand Prix in the Bois de Boulogne Park in the French capital city, which Farina won in a Maserati.

===Round 1: Switzerland===
A week after the BRDC International Trophy race, the Formula One Championship season started in Switzerland at the very dangerous and tree-lined Bremgarten public road circuit near Bern around the time the Monaco Grand Prix would have been held, but that historic race was not held this year. Alfa Romeo, the dominant team in 1950 with its supercharged 159 Alfetta, took the first five places on the grid, except 3rd, which Luigi Villoresi took in a Ferrari. Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio was on pole position, with his Italian teammate Giuseppe &quot;Nino&quot; Farina alongside him. The race started while it was raining, and with its overhanging trees lining the road, this circuit was even more dangerous in the wet. But Fangio made no mistake and won the race from Piero Taruffi in a Ferrari and Farina, whose decision to run the race without changing tires proved wrong.

===Round 2: Indianapolis 500===
The Indianapolis 500 in the United States was run three days after the Swiss Grand Prix on a Wednesday. It was the only non-European championship round and the only round that was not run to FIA Grand Prix regulations. Lee Wallard won this demanding race in his Kurtis Kraft-Offenhauser.

===Round 3: Belgium===
Farina had won again at Ulster Trophy held at the very dangerous and fast Dundrod circuit in Northern Ireland in an Alfa, and the next championship Grand Prix was in Belgium at the fastest circuit of the year: the spectacular and rural Spa-Francorchamps circuit. With Fangio and Farina once again 1–2 with the Ferraris of Villoresi and Alberto Ascari taking 3rd and 4th, the Alfas and Ferraris dueled around this circuit, with only 13 entries – small grids in all kinds of motorsports in Europe were commonplace at Spa, because of the fear most drivers had of the circuit. Farina, already on a high after winning at Dundrod, won by three minutes over Ascari and Villoresi, with Fangio finishing four laps down in 9th after one of his Alfa&#x27;s wheels jammed on its hub.

===Round 4: France===
The French Grand Prix, given the honorary designation of the European Grand Prix this year, was held at the very fast Reims-Gueux circuit (a circuit only two mph slower than Spa) deep in northern French champagne country played the host for an exciting race. Fangio, on pole again, was beaten off the line by 3rd-placed qualifier Ascari, with 2nd-placed qualifier Farina making a terrible start and dropping to 11th. On this triangular public road circuit, made up entirely of long straights, slight kinks, and slow, angular corners saw Ascari retire his car with a broken gearbox and Fangio nursing a sick car. Farina pushed very hard and eventually took the lead. Argentine José Froilán González was 2nd in a Ferrari, and 53-year old pre-war great Luigi Fagioli in an Alfa was 3rd in a one-off appearance this year. González was chasing Farina very hard, but Farina&#x27;s car developed magneto problems and had to fall back, which put González in the lead, with Fagioli in 2nd. However, during both the leader&#x27;s pitstops, as was commonplace in Grand Prix racing up until 1957, when it was banned – González handed his car over to Ascari, and Fagioli exchanged his healthy car with Fangio&#x27;s mechanically unhealthy car, so Ascari and Fangio were back in 1st and 2nd where they had been before. But Fangio took advantage of Ascari&#x27;s brake problems on his Ferrari (the Reims-Gueux circuit was very hard on engines and brakes) to win a race that holds the record for the longest racing distance ever completed for a Grand Prix, . Fagioli, finishing 22 laps down and furious over having to swap cars with Fangio, quit Grand Prix racing on the spot. The veteran Italian would die after crashing a Lancia during a sportscar race at Monaco in 1952.

===Round 5: Britain===
The British Grand Prix at the Silverstone airfield circuit in England played host to round 5 of the World Championship, and this race was to make history. The Alfa Romeos, with their powerful 420 hp supercharged 1.5L engines were fast but had horrendous fuel consumption: 6.5 km/L per gallon (thanks to the relatively simple pre-World War II engine design), meaning that Fangio and Farina had to stop twice to refuel, José Froilán González in the more fuel-efficient 4.5L naturally aspirated V12 Ferrari went on to win, with Fangio second. This was the first time Enzo Ferrari had won a Grand Prix with a car of his own company&#x27;s construction, and this team went on to be the most successful in Formula One history.

===Round 6: Germany===
A week after the British Grand Prix, the non-championship Dutch Grand Prix at the fast beachside Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam was won by Louis Rosier in a Talbot, ahead of veteran Phillippe Etancelin and up-and-comer Stirling Moss in an HWM.

West Germany had been banned from international sports competitions until 1951, so the German Grand Prix was able to be a Grand Prix championship round for the first time since 1939. The venue was the same as it had been in 1939 – it was the dauntingly challenging, dangerous, and twisty Nürburgring Nordschleife. Ascari took pole position in front of his teammate González and Alfa drivers Fangio and Farina. At the start, Farina took the lead, but the Alfas started to develop overheating problems, and Farina soon retired. In addition to engine problems, the gearbox in Fangio&#x27;s Alfa lost 1st and 2nd of four gears. After trading the lead with Fangio during pitstops, Ascari took the lead and won his first championship Formula One Grand Prix.

===Round 7: Italy===
A week after the German Grand Prix was the Albi Grand Prix on a high-speed and dangerous public road circuit outside the southwestern French village of Albi. Maurice Trintignant won this race in a Simca. Ten days after this race, the Coppa Acerbo at the and dauntingly dangerous Pescara Circuit in eastern Italy, which was won by José Froilán González in a Ferrari. Two weeks later, Fangio won the Bari Grand Prix in the small southeastern Italian coastal city.

Italy was the next championship race, and the Monza Autodrome near Milan played host to the seventh round of the Formula One Grand Prix championship. Fangio, in an Alfa, pole position again, but he retired his car, which had engine problems; Farina, who had taken Felice Bonetto&#x27;s Alfa, had a leaking fuel tank and had to come in twice for fuel, which dropped him down the order far enough for him only to get as far as third. Fellow local hero and Milan native Ascari won again in his Ferrari–which kept his championship hopes alive to catch the leader Fangio going into the last championship Grand Prix in Spain.

===Round 8: Spain===
The last non-championship race of the year, the Goodwood Trophy, was won by Farina in an Alfa three weeks after the Italian Grand Prix.

The first ever Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, held at the Pedralbes street circuit in Barcelona, took place four weeks after the Goodwood Trophy race. The Ferrari and Alfa Romeo teams each ran four cars, with Ferrari fielding Ascari, Gigi Villoresi, Froilan González, and Piero Taruffi and Alfa Romeo running Fangio, Giuseppe Farina, Felice Bonetto, and Baron Emanuel de Graffenried. Ascari was fastest in practice and shared the front row of the 4–3–4 grid with Fangio, González, and Farina. Behind them were Villoresi, de Graffenried and Taruffi. Ascari led from the start, with González chasing, but by the end of the first lap, González had dropped to fifth behind Farina, Fangio, and Bonetto. Fangio quickly passed Farina and took the lead from Ascari on the fourth lap. As Fangio sailed away to victory, Ferrari&#x27;s challenge fell apart along with its tires – the team having opted to use smaller wheels than normal. By the time the team had sorted out the problem, Ascari was two laps behind. Fangio duly won the race and his first of five championships, with González finishing second and Farina third.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===
Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best four results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in half points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Championship of Drivers standings===

* † Position shared between two or more drivers of the same car

==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One races, which did not count towards the World Championship, were also held in 1951.

<text>Oscar Polk (December 25, 1899 – January 4, 1949) was an American actor. He portrayed the enslaved man Pork in the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939).

== Life and career ==
His most memorable scene in that film comes when Pork discloses to Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, portrayed by Vivien Leigh, that the back property taxes “done run up sky high” on Tara in the amount of $300. He was married to Ivy V. Polk (née Ivy Parsons, born October 12, 1920), who had a deleted scene in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. They had a son, Oscar Polk Jr.

On January 4, 1949, Oscar Polk was fatally struck by a taxi cab as he stepped off a curb in Times Square in New York City 10 days after his 49th birthday. At the time of his death, he was scheduled to have a major role in the play &quot;Leading Lady&quot;, and he was replaced by Ossie Davis. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Long Island, New York.

<text>The 1950 Formula One season was the fourth season of the FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the inaugural FIA World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over seven races between 13 May and 3 September 1950. The only one outside of Europe was the Indianapolis 500, which was run to AAA National Championship regulations. No Formula One drivers competed in the Indy 500 or vice versa. Finally, the season also included several non-championship races for Formula One cars.

Alfa Romeo entered a supercharged 158, a well-developed pre-war design that debuted in 1938, and managed to win all six races they competed in. Italian Giuseppe &quot;Nino&quot; Farina and Argentine teammate Juan Manuel Fangio both won three races and set three fastest laps. But Fangio did not score points in the other three races, while Farina finished fourth in Belgium, handing him the championship.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1950 FIA World Championship of Drivers. The cars were entered by 30 teams; 4 works teams (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Maserati, and Talbot-Lago) and 26 privateer teams. The list does not include those that only contested the Indianapolis 500.

The Alfa Romeo team dominated the British Grand Prix at the fast Silverstone circuit in England, locking out the four-car front row of the grid. With King George VI in attendance, Giuseppe Farina won the race from pole position, also setting the fastest lap. The podium was completed by his teammates Luigi Fagioli and Reg Parnell, while the remaining Alfa driver, Juan Manuel Fangio, was forced to retire after experiencing problems with his engine. The final points scorers were the works Talbot-Lagos of Yves Giraud-Cabantous and Louis Rosier, both two laps behind the leaders.

===Round 2: Monaco===
Scuderia Ferrari made their World Championship debut around the streets of Monaco. Their leading drivers, Luigi Villoresi and Alberto Ascari had to settle for the third row of the grid, however, while the Alfa Romeos of Fangio and Farina again started from the front row, alongside the privateer Maserati of José Froilán González. Polesitter Fangio took a comfortable victory, setting the race&#x27;s fastest lap, a whole lap ahead of Ascari, with the third-placed Louis Chiron a further lap back in the works Maserati. A first-lap accident caused by the damp track had eliminated nine of the nineteen starters—including Farina and Fagioli—while González, who had incurred damage in the pile-up, retired on the following lap. Villoresi, although delayed by the accident, had made his way through the field to second place but was forced to retire with an axle problem. Fangio&#x27;s win brought him level with Farina in the points standings.

===Round 3: Indianapolis 500===
The Indianapolis 500, the third round of the inaugural World Championship of Drivers held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana, in the United States, was won by the Kurtis Kraft-Offenhauser of Johnnie Parsons, ahead of the Diedt-Offenhausers of Bill Holland and Mauri Rose. The race was stopped after 138 of the scheduled 200 laps due to rain.

===Round 4: Switzerland===
Alfa Romeo&#x27;s dominance continued when the World Championship returned to Europe for the Swiss Grand Prix at the tree-lined Bremgarten circuit outside Bern. Fangio, Farina, and Fagioli locked out the front row of the grid for Alfa, while the Ferraris of Villoresi and Ascari started from the second row. Fangio was the initial leader, starting from pole position, but Farina passed him on lap seven. Ascari and Villoresi were both able to compete with the third Alfa of Fagioli in the early stages, although both had retired by the ten-lap mark. Farina took the win and the fastest lap, finishing just ahead of Fagioli, while Rosier, in third place due to Fangio&#x27;s retirement, took Talbot-Lago&#x27;s first podium. Farina&#x27;s second win of the season put him six points clear of the consistent Fagioli, while Fangio was a further three points behind, having only scored points in one race (in Monaco, where he won).

===Round 5: Belgium===
Alfa Romeo took their third front row lockout of the season at the Belgian Grand Prix at the speedy Spa-Francorchamps circuit, while the Ferrari of Villoresi shared the second row with the privateer Talbot-Lago of Raymond Sommer. The Alfas were once again untouchable at the start of the race, but when they stopped for fuel, Sommer emerged as an unlikely race leader. His lead, however, was short-lived, and he was forced to retire when his engine blew up. Fangio ultimately took the victory, ahead of Fagioli, who again finished second. Rosier again made the podium in his Talbot-Lago. He had been able to pass the polesitter Farina when the Italian picked up transmission problems towards the end of the race. It was not all bad for Farina, however, as he picked up the point for fastest lap. Fagioli and Fangio closed the gap to Farina in the points standings—Fagioli was just four points adrift, while Fangio was a further point behind.

===Round 6: France===
Alfa Romeo was largely unchallenged at the French Grand Prix, held at the high-speed Reims-Gueux circuit, due to the withdrawal of the works Ferraris of Ascari and Villoresi. The Alfas produced yet another lockout of the front row of the grid, with Fangio taking pole for the third time in six races. The power of the Alfas suited this public road circuit- made up entirely of long straights, and Farina, starting from second, led for the first quarter of the race before fuel problems put him to the back of the field. He fought back to third before he was forced to retire (he was ultimately classified seventh). Fangio picked up the fastest lap on his way to his second consecutive victory. Fagioli finished second for the fourth time out of five starts, while Peter Whitehead, in a privateer Ferrari, took a maiden podium in his first start of the season. Fangio took the championship lead as a result of his victory. Fagioli remained in second, while Farina dropped to third, four points behind his Argentinian teammate.

===Round 7: Italy===
The final championship round of the season was the Italian Grand Prix at the Monza Autodrome near Milan, and all three of the regular Alfa Romeo drivers were in contention for the title. If Fangio finished first or second, he would win the title, regardless of where his teammates finished. If Farina failed to score at least five points, he would be unable to take the title. Fagioli&#x27;s only chance of becoming World Champion was if he won the race and set the fastest lap; even then, he would need Farina to finish no higher than third, and Fangio would have to score no points at all.

Fangio again took pole position, but Alfa Romeo could not make it a fifth front-row lockout of the season, as Ascari qualified second for Ferrari. Farina started from third, while Consalvo Sanesi completed the front row in an additional Alfa Romeo. Fagioli could only manage fifth on the grid, alongside the fifth Alfa of Piero Taruffi, the second Ferrari of Dorino Serafini, and Sommer in a Talbot-Lago. Farina took the lead early on, with Ascari and Fangio not far behind. Ascari briefly held the lead but was forced to retire when his engine overheated. Two laps later, Fangio also retired due to problems with his gearbox. Taruffi&#x27;s car, which was now running in second, was taken over by Fangio, although the Argentinian was forced to retire for the second time in the race, this time with engine problems. Ascari took over Serafini&#x27;s car and ultimately finished second behind Farina, whose victory clinched the title by taking him three points clear of Fangio. Fagioli finished third in the race, and clinched the same position in the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best four results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in half points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:

===World Championship of Drivers standings===

* † Position shared between more drivers of the same car

==Non-championship races==
The following Formula One races, which did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers, were also held in 1950.

<text>USS &quot;Bumper&quot; (SS-333), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the bumper, a small fish of the North and South Atlantic Ocean.

Between 22 April and 15 August 1945 &quot;Bumper&quot; completed two war patrols in the Java Sea, South China Sea, and Gulf of Siam. During this time she sank a 1,189-gross register ton tanker at sea, sank another small tanker at anchor, and sank four miscellaneous small craft by gunfire.

She served in the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Çanakkale&quot; (S 333) from 1950 to 1976.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bumper&quot; was laid down on 4 November 1943 by the Electric Boat Company, at Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 6 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Williams (&quot;née&quot; Smith), wife of &quot;Bumper&quot;&#x27;s prospective commanding officer, and commissioned on 9 December 1944 with Commander Joseph W. Williams, Jr., in command.

==United States Navy==
===December 1944–May 1945===
Following her commissioning, &quot;Bumper&quot; conducted her shakedown training off the New England coast, and then reported to Key West, Florida, for training at the Sound School. Soon after her arrival at Key West, the crew discovered corrosion in the main hydraulic system which forced &quot;Bumper&quot; to return to the Electric Boat Company for repairs. On 19 February 1945, &quot;Bumper&quot; once again got underway for Florida and the Panama Canal Zone. After two weeks of advanced exercises in submarine warfare, Bumper left the Panama Canal Zone on 15 March 1945 to report to the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where she spent three weeks preparing herself in Pacific Fleet procedures.

===First war patrol===
&quot;Bumper&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 22 April 1945 to begin her first war patrol. After refueling at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 4 May 1945, she proceeded to her patrol area in the South China Sea. Although she searched for Japanese ships, her primary mission was lifeguard duty off Formosa and Hainan Island in support of Allied airstrikes there. On 6 June 1945, the submarine relieved &quot;Bumper&quot;, which made for Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands. While en route to Subic Bay, she received orders to relieve the submarine to allow &quot;Icefish&quot; to return to port with some injured aviators. &quot;Bumper&quot; rode out a small typhoon before the submarine relieved her. &quot;Bumper&quot; then proceeded to Subic Bay for a refit alongside the submarine tender .

===Second war patrol===

&quot;Bumper&quot; stood out of Subic Bay on 10 July 1945 to begin her second war patrol, this time assigned a patrol area in the Gulf of Siam near Singapore. There, she sighted and pursued a Japanese convoy of two small tankers and a cargo ship screened by a destroyer and several smaller escorts. However, &quot;Bumper&quot;′s initial attacks on the convoy were unsuccessful, as were those of &quot;Bugara&quot; and the submarine . On 15 July 1945, a Japanese schooner sailing south along the coast came into &quot;Bumper&quot;′s sights, and she sank it with gunfire. On 17 July 1945, she sank a Japanese coastal cargo ship with gunfire, and the entire incident was recorded on film.

&quot;Bumper&quot; also continued to dog the track of the convoy. After pursuing it for over two weeks, she had another chance to attack it on 20 July 1945. She fired her last three torpedoes at one of the small tankers and sank &quot;Kyoei Maru&quot; along with her cargo of oil. &quot;Bumper&quot; then submerged to give her crew a brief rest before heading for Subic Bay to reload torpedoes. Following reloading, she patrolled off Singapore and in the Java Sea. During the morning of 5 August 1945, she sighted and sank with gunfire a tug, a barge, and later a small sailing vessel.

Claiming to have sent some 2,500 gross register tons of shipping to the bottom, &quot;Bumper&quot; made for Fremantle, Australia, where she arrived on 15 August 1945. Just an hour after her arrival, hostilities with Japan ended, bringing World War II to an end.

===Post-World War II===
Following a refit alongside the submarine tender , &quot;Bumper&quot; got underway from Fremantle on 31 August 1945 along with &quot;Brill&quot;, &quot;Bugara&quot;, and the submarine bound for Subic Bay, where she arrived on 9 September 1945. She served as a unit of Submarines, Philippine Sea Frontier, devoting herself mainly to training missions.

&quot;Bumper&quot; departed Subic Bay on 7 January 1946 and proceeded to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 4 February 1946 and began repairs. Repairs completed, she spent April 1946 in intensive training, and on 6 May 1946 she headed for her new home port, Pearl Harbor, and reported for duty there with Submarine Squadron 5. After two more months of training, &quot;Bumper&quot;′s crew, although cut to 75 percent of authorized strength and with a few United States Naval Reserve personnel remaining, was deemed ready for duty. Until the end of July, Bumper operated in routine exercises in the waters of the Hawaiian Islands in a stepped-down post-World War II environment. After overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, from August through October 1946, she returned to Pearl Harbor, where she participated in training exercises in Hawaiian waters with other squadrons.

On 16 December 1946, &quot;Bumper&quot; departed Pearl Harbor to conduct a simulated war patrol. She called at Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands, Guam in the Mariana Islands, Subic Bay, Yokosuka in Japan, and Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. She also spent six weeks with Northern Training Group, Western Pacific, at Tsingtao, China, and in the Yellow Sea. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1947.

After two weeks of upkeep, &quot;Bumper&quot; resumed local operations in Hawaiian waters. In April 1947 she was assigned to drill Task Force 38 in antisubmarine warfare. A coordinated attack group composed of &quot;Bumper&quot;, &quot;Chub&quot;, and the submarines and made practice attacks on the task force, approaching the surface ships silently and submerged to stay undetected for as long as possible. Similar drills took place in May 1947 and continued through the end of the year.

Early in January 1948 &quot;Bumper&quot; proceeded to San Diego, where she arrived on 12 January and began work with the Sound School on a variety of sonar research projects. In February 1948 she carried out a two-week Naval Reserve training cruise before beginning a three-month overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. On 12 June 1948, she arrived at Pearl Harbor and resume her usual operational schedule in Hawaiian waters. She made a second simulated war patrol, conducting antisubmarine warfare drills with the seaplane tender while making port visits to Hong Kong, Okinawa, Sasebo in Japan, Tsingtao, and Midway Atoll. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 September 1948 and spent the rest of the year in local training operations with Submarine Squadron 5.

&quot;Bumper&quot; operated from Pearl Harbor until 7 February 1950, when she got underway bound for the United States East Coast. She transited the Panama Canal on 22 February 1950 and operated along the U.S. East Coast until entering the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at League Island in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a modernization overhaul. On 16 September 1950, she reported to New London to take on Turkish sailors for training. She was decommissioned on 16 November 1950, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 20 December 1950.

===Honors and awards===
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service
* Navy Occupation Service Medal with &quot;ASIA&quot; clasp
* China Service Medal

== Turkish Navy ==
The submarine was transferred to Turkey on 16 November 1950 under the terms of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program and commissioned that day in the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Çanakkale&quot; (S 333). She served in the Turkish Navy until she was decommissioned 11 August 1976.

<doc id="1140141" wikidata="Q1144913" url="?curid=1140141" title="Water intoxication">
<text>Water intoxication, also known as water poisoning, hyperhydration, overhydration, or water toxemia, is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions that can result when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside safe limits by excessive water intake.

Under normal circumstances, accidentally consuming too much water is exceptionally rare. Most deaths related to water intoxication in healthy individuals have resulted either from water-drinking contests, in which individuals attempt to consume large amounts of water, or from long bouts of exercise during which excessive amounts of fluid were consumed. In addition, water cure, a method of torture in which the victim is forced to consume excessive amounts of water, can cause water intoxication.

Water, like any other substance, can be considered a poison when over-consumed in a brief period. Water intoxication mostly occurs when water is being consumed in a high quantity provoking disturbances in electrolyte balance.

Excess of body water may also be a result of a medical condition or improper treatment; see &quot;hyponatremia&quot; for some examples. Water is considered one of the least toxic chemical compounds, with an LD50 exceeding body weight in rats; drinking six liters in three hours has caused the death of a human.

==Risk factors==
===Low body mass (infants)===
It can be very easy for children under one year old (especially those under nine months) to absorb too much water. Because of their small body mass, it is easy for them to take in a large amount of water relative to body mass and total body sodium stores.

===Endurance sports===
Marathon runners are susceptible to water intoxication if they drink too much while running. This occurs when sodium levels drop below 135 mmol/L, which can happen when athletes consume large amounts of fluid. This has been noted to be the result of the encouragement of excessive fluid replacement by various guidelines. This has largely been identified in marathon runners as a dilutional hyponatremia. A study conducted on runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon found that thirteen percent finished the race with hyponatremia. The study concluded that the strongest predictor of hyponatremia was weight gain while racing (over-hydration), and hyponatremia was just as likely to occur in runners who chose sports drinks as those who chose water.

===Military training===
Hyponatremia and other physical conditions associated with water intoxication are more often seen in those participating in military training. One US Army study found 17 trainees were admitted to hospital over a year&#x27;s period for water intoxication while another found that three soldiers had died, leading to a recommendation that no more than 1–1.5 L of water should be consumed per hour of heavy sweating.

===Overexertion and heat stress===
Any activity or situation that promotes heavy sweating can lead to water intoxication when water is consumed to replace lost fluids. Persons working in extreme heat and/or humidity for long periods must take care to drink and eat in ways that help to maintain electrolyte balance. People using drugs such as MDMA (often referred to colloquially as &quot;Ecstasy&quot;) may overexert themselves, perspire heavily, feel increased thirst, and then drink large amounts of water to rehydrate, leading to electrolyte imbalance and water intoxication – this is compounded by MDMA use increasing the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), decreasing the amount of water lost through urination. Even people who are resting quietly in extreme heat or humidity may run the risk of water intoxication if they drink large amounts of water over short periods for rehydration.

===Psychiatric conditions===
Psychogenic polydipsia is a psychiatric condition in which patients feel compelled to drink excessive quantities of water, thus putting them at risk of water intoxication. This condition can be especially dangerous if the patient also exhibits other psychiatric indications (as is often the case), as the caretakers might misinterpret the hyponatremic symptoms.

===Iatrogenic===
When an unconscious person is being fed intravenously (for example, total parenteral nutrition) or via a nasogastric tube, the fluids given must be carefully balanced in composition to match fluids and electrolytes lost. These fluids are typically hypertonic, and so water is often co-administered. If the electrolytes are not monitored (even in an ambulatory patient), either hypernatremia or hyponatremia may result.

Some neurological/psychiatric medications (oxcarbazepine, among others) have been found to cause hyponatremia in some patients. Patients with diabetes insipidus are particularly vulnerable due to rapid fluid processing.

==Pathophysiology==
At the onset of this condition, fluid outside the cells has an excessively low amount of solutes, such as sodium and other electrolytes, in comparison to the fluid inside the cells, causing the fluid to move into the cells to balance its osmotic concentration. This causes the cells to swell. The swelling increases intracranial pressure in the brain, which leads to the first observable symptoms of water intoxication: headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness. These are sometimes followed by difficulty breathing during exertion, muscle weakness and pain, twitching, or cramping, nausea, vomiting, thirst, and a dulled ability to perceive and interpret sensory information. As the condition persists, papillary and vital signs may result including bradycardia and widened pulse pressure. The cells in the brain may swell to the point where blood flow is interrupted resulting in cerebral edema. Swollen brain cells may also apply pressure to the brain stem causing central nervous system dysfunction. Both cerebral edema and interference with the central nervous system are dangerous and could result in seizures, brain damage, coma, or death.

== Prevention ==

Water intoxication can be prevented if a person&#x27;s intake of water does not grossly exceed their losses. Healthy kidneys can excrete approximately 800 millilitres to one litre of fluid water (0.84–1.04 quarts) per hour. However, stress (from prolonged physical exertion), as well as disease states, can greatly reduce this amount.

==Treatment==
Mild intoxication may remain asymptomatic and require only fluid restriction. In more severe cases, treatment consists of:
* Diuretics to increase urination, which are most effective for excess blood volume.
* Vasopressin receptor antagonists

==Notable cases==
* 1097: During the First Crusade, according to at least one chronicle, many Crusaders died after drinking too much from a river while marching to Antioch.
* 1991, Andy Warhol: Five years after his death, Warhol&#x27;s family publicly accused the hospital where he had his gallbladder removed of causing his death by water intoxication administered post-operatively. A claimed autopsy weight of , with his weight being when admitted, was cited as evidence that too much fluid had been given.
* November 16, 1995: Leah Betts, a British schoolgirl, died as the result of drinking too much water, though in the media her death was mistakenly attributed to taking an ecstasy tablet at her 18th birthday party.
* 2003: British actor Anthony Andrews survived a case of water intoxication. He was performing as Henry Higgins in a revival of the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the time and consumed up to eight litres of water a day. He was unconscious and in intensive care for three days.
* February 2, 2005: Matthew Carrington, a student at Chico State University in Chico, California, died as a direct result of a fraternity hazing ritual involving forced water intoxication.
* January 12, 2007: Jennifer Strange died after drinking nearly of water in an attempt to win a Nintendo Wii. The KDND radio station&#x27;s morning show, the &quot;Morning Rave&quot;, held an on-air contest entitled &quot;Hold Your Wee for a Wii,&quot; in which contestants were asked to drink as much water as they could without urinating. The DJs were made aware of the dangers but did not inform the contestants. KDND&#x27;s parent company, Entercom Sacramento LLC, was subsequently ordered to pay $16,577,118 in damages to Strange&#x27;s family.
* March 11, 2020: Zachary Sabin, an 11-year-old child, died after being forced to drink almost three liters of water in just four hours by his parents. They thought his urine was too dark, so they made him drink water until he threw up.
* A 2022 study proposed that martial-arts actor Bruce Lee&#x27;s death in 1973 was due to water poisoning.
* July 4, 2023: A 35-year-old Indiana woman died after consuming too much water while on vacation with her family.

<doc id="1140150" wikidata="Q704278" url="?curid=1140150" title="Mahan confederacy">
<text>Mahan () was a tribal grouping in southwestern Korea described in Chinese sources from the 3rd century. It was the largest of the &#x27;three Hans&#x27; (the Samhan), along with Byeonhan and Jinhan. During the 4th century, the kingdom of Baekje rose in the territory of Mahan and became one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Mahan (馬韓)&quot; is believed to be a combination of Old Korean words. &quot;Ma (마)&quot; in native Korean meant &quot;South&quot; while &quot;Han (한)&quot; meant &quot;big&quot;, giving the meaning of Mahan, the &quot;Big Nation of the South&quot;.
As part of the Samhan, Jinhan meant &quot;Big Nation of the East&quot; and Byeonhan meant &quot;Big Nation of Shimmer&quot;.

==History==
Mahan probably developed from the existing bronze society of third to second centuries BC, continuing to absorb migration from the north in subsequent centuries. King Jun of the kingdom of Gija Joseon in northern Korea, having lost the throne to Wiman, fled to the state of Jin in southern Korea around 194 - 180 BC. He and his followers are thought to have established a base within Jin territory. It is not certain whether Mahan conquered or arose out of this entity, but Mahan was certainly influenced by this influx of northern culture. 

Further migration followed the fall of Wiman Joseon and establishment of the Chinese commanderies in the Korean Peninsula region in 108 BC. It is described in the Chinese chronicle &quot;San Guo Zhi&quot; and the much later Korean chronicles &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; and &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;.

In the 1st century AD, the Wolji/Mokji (月支/目支) state, that formed and led Mahan confederacy, was defeated in struggles with Baekje, another member of Mahan, and consequently losing whole region of present-day Han River basin. But the San Guo Zhi recorded the Han state fallen in struggles with the Lelang Commandery and Daifang Commandery in the 246. Under continuous pressure from Baekje, only 20 statelets of Mahan confederacy survived until the late 3rd century. Baekje eventually absorbed or conquered all of Mahan by the 5th century, growing into one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, along with Silla and Goguryeo.

==Politics==
Kings of Mahan occasionally called themselves &quot;King of Jin,&quot; referring to the earlier Jin state and asserting nominal sovereignty over all of Samhan. A wealth of bronze artifacts and production facilities indicate that Mahan was probably the earliest developed of the three Hans. At its height, Mahan covered much of the Han River Basin and the modern-day provinces of Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeolla, although political unity was strongest led by Mokji state (목지국, 目支國) in Cheonan, Chungcheong.

==Culture==
==Legacy==
Goryeo historians identified Mahan with Goguryeo, which was supported by their works like &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; and &quot;Jewang Ungi&quot;. That historical view was previously given by Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn, a noted Confucian scholar and historian in the late Silla period. Apart from the geographical location of Mahan, the Chinese historical record &quot;History of Song&quot; defines the ethnical origin of the Jeong-an kingdom, a successor state of Balhae, as Mahan. 

In the late Joseon period, that historical notion came under criticism by early Silhak scholar Han Baek-gyeom, who emphasized the linkage between Mahan and Baekje in terms of the geographical location.

<doc id="1140152" wikidata="Q5597696" url="?curid=1140152" title="Gratis Internet">
<text>Gratis Internet was an American referral marketing company based in Washington D.C. that rewarded customers with technological consumer products of high-demand such as the iPod and PlayStation 3. In 2004, it became a member of the Inc. 500 and in 2005 ranked eighteenth. Its name comes from the Latin word &quot;Gratis&quot;, meaning &quot;free of charge&quot;. The company stopped operating entirely or was bought by another company around 2010.

Following its rise and eventual closure, &quot;Gratis Internet&quot; was a subject of repeated criticism for its false advertising in regards to products it offered being entirely &quot;free&quot; and general business structure that, as a referral system, was by design an unsustainable pyramid scheme where only early adopters could profit in short term.

==History==

Gratis Internet was established in 2001. By July 2004, it launched a number of Web sites offering free merchandise, most notably iPods, to users who register and complete membership requirements.

Although the word &quot;free&quot; is used prominently, would-be members seeking to complete an offer to qualify for the free merchandise are often given a number of options, some of which involve signing up and paying for a service or subscription. Gratis websites were launched in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and Australia.

Gratis&#x27;s revenue in 2004 was US$20.5 million, according to Inc.com. Inc.com also reported that Gratis Internet had only 12 employees.

FreePay became the brand name for all of Gratis Internet&#x27;s websites in August 2005, including the original FreeCondoms.com and FreeIpods.com..

In March 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed suit against the company, alleging that it sold personal information obtained from millions of consumers despite a strict promise of confidentiality. The suit followed a $1.1 million settlement by Datran Media, which had obtained 7.2 million names, e-mail addresses, home phone numbers, and street addresses from Gratis Internet. Gratis co-founder Peter Martin disputed that his company ever sold or rented out customer information, saying that it hired Datran Media to work on creative design and back-office support for its e-mail marketing campaigns.

In May 2006, Gratis Internet announced new terms of service, allowing users only three months to complete an offer and refer five friends.

In February 2010, a Gratis Internet spinout called Social Cash, an advertising network for Facebook applications, was purchased by LifeStreet Media, of San Carlos, Calif., for an undisclosed sum.

==Complaints==
In September 2004, the company was criticized by customers for failing to ship iPods, and for inundating them with additional spam e-mail. The company said it was shipping iPods, but that they could not get enough from Apple Computer to fill the demand. The co-founders, Peter Martin and Rob Jewell, denied giving customer e-mail information to third-party companies, but admitted customers do receive a small number of messages from select parties. &quot;We warn our users they may get some messages from our marketing partners&quot;, Jewell said.

As of November 2008, the company had an unsatisfactory record with the Better Business Bureau due to unanswered complaints. In the 36 months prior to November 2008, the Bureau had processed 848 complaints about Gratis Internet.

== FreePay process ==

In order to receive the advertised &quot;free gift&quot; at each of Gratis&#x27; websites, a visitor is required to register and complete one affiliate offer. Affiliates include AOL, Blockbuster, RealNetworks, casino and credit card offers, and others. The affiliate offers typically consist of trial memberships, service subscriptions, credit card applications and the like; some require credit cards during registration, and a few involve payment of some kind, causing critics to claim the &quot;free&quot; label a misnomer.

The visitor is then required to refer a set number of people, which varies by the product (the number required is usually the MSRP of the gift divided by US$50). A valid referral is one which has both completed registration via a referral link and signed up for an affiliate offer. Each referral must be a unique user or the account will be &quot;put on hold&quot; during the approval process. Because sponsors must acknowledge the completion of their offer, they are willing to invest more for each referral than they might for other, more traditional forms of advertising.

The advertisers pay Gratis for the referral, between $25 and $90, though the company did not release information as to specific numbers. For example: assuming the MSRP of an iPod is $250, five affiliate signups (the number needed for one user to redeem a free iPod) nets Gratis between $150 and $540. Per the program&#x27;s terms, Gratis does not need to deliver an iPod to any member with four or fewer referrals.

Following the creation of Gratis Internet, similar companies were created offering similar incentives for completed offers. Gratis Internet and its initial service, FreeCondoms.com are credited with creating the incentive marketing industry.

<text>Bathurst Manor is a neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in northern Toronto in the former suburb of North York. It sits on a plateau bounded on the north by Finch Avenue West, on the west by Dufferin Street, on the east by the Don River (west branch), and on the south by Sheppard Avenue West. The area is also regarded as part of the Downsview postal area as designated by Canada Post. It is part of the former city of North York, which merged with five other municipalities and a regional government to form the new &quot;City of Toronto&quot; in 1998. It is part of the federal and provincial electoral district York Centre, and Toronto electoral ward 10: York Centre (East). In 2006, it had a population of 14,615.

==History==
Bathurst Manor is one of several Jewish-populated neighbourhoods on Bathurst Street. It is a suburban community built between 1954 and the early 1960s. While most of the population was originally Jewish, and several synagogue congregations are located in the neighbourhood, there are also significant Italian, Russian and Filipino populations.

In 1996, the Toronto Transit Commission extended subway service to the area with the opening of the Sheppard West station, at Allen Road and Sheppard Avenue, allowing a thirty-minute train ride to Union Station at the southern cusp of downtown Toronto.

==Demographics==
The community is home to the Canadian headquarters of B&#x27;nai Brith at 15 Hove St, the Bathurst Jewish Community Centre (BJCC), the Lipa Green Building at 4588 Bathurst St is for Jewish Community Services. Bathurst Manor&#x27;s Top ten ethnic and cultural groups (by ancestry) in 2016:
*13% - Filipino
*13% - Russian
*11% - Italian
*11% - Polish
*9% - Canadian
*6% - Jews
*6% - Chinese
*5% - English
*5% - Ukrainian
*4% - Greek
The percentage of population below the poverty line dropped from 22% (in 1996) to 18% (in 2001).

==Education==

The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is an English first language public secular school board that operates several schools in the neighbourhood.:

* Cedar Grove Public School opened in 1958 as a Kindergarten to Grade 8 school before the construction of Dufferin Heights. This school was renamed to Charles H. Best West Elementary School in 1978 operating from Kindergarten to Grade 5, before being separated in 2002 as a K-4 school and renamed to Wilmington Elementary School in 2004.
* Charles H. Best Junior Middle School was built in 1960 as Dufferin Heights Junior High School operating Grades 7 to 9. In 1978, this school became Charles H. Best East Middle School operating from Grades 6 to 8, before becoming its own school in 2002 as a grades 5-8 school and renamed to Charles H. Best Middle School in 2004 and again in 2018.
* Wilmington Public School is located on 200 Wilmington Avenue and opened in 1954. This school was closed in 1978 and amalgamated with Cedar Grove and Dufferin Grove to form Charles H. Best. Community Hebrew Academy of Toronto, a private Jewish high school, moved to this building in 1979. The Wilmington name was reused for the old Cedar Grove building in 2004.
* William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute

Three other public school boards also provide schooling to applicable students in Bathurst Manor, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), and the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). CSV is a French first language secular school board, whereas CSCM and TCDSB are public separate school boards, the former being a French first language school board, the latter being an English first language school board. Neither CSCM, CSV, and TCDSB operates a school in Bathurst Manor, with their students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

The public post-secondary institution, the University of Toronto, also operates the Institute for Aerospace Studies in the northern portions of the neighbourhood.

==Governance==
Bathurst Manor is part of the Federal and Provincial riding of York Centre, represented by M.P. Ya&#x27;ara Saks and M.P.P. Michael Kerzner, the former being a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and the latter being a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. Municipally, the constituency is also known as Ward 6, which is represented by Councillor James Pasternak.

Bathurst Manor is located within 32 Division of the Toronto Police Service and is most often serviced by Station 143 of the Toronto Fire Services.

==Recreation==

Several municipal parks are located in the Bathurst Manor including Garthdale Park, G. Ross Lord Park, Irving W. Chapley Park, and Maxwell Park, and the West Don Parklands. Municipal parks in Toronto are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. Several municipal parks in the neighbourhood are situated near the Don Valley, which forms a part of the Toronto ravine system.

The Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division also manages the Irving W. Chapley Community Centre (named after a local alderman) is located in Irving W. Chapley Park. This community centre features a tot&#x27;s play area, meeting rooms and an outdoor pool and water play area. In addition to Irving W. Chaley Community Centre, the neighbourhood is also home to the Prosserman Jewish Community Centre (PJCC). PJCC is a multi purpose facility with cardiovascular conditioning equipment, indoor and outdoor pools, indoor and outdoor track, and tennis and basketball courts. This centre is also the home of the Leah Posluns Theatre and formerly the Koffler Gallery when the site was known as the Bathurst Jewish Community Centre.

Skiing was popular during the 1950s at a ski hill located adjacent to what is now Blue Forest Drive. In the summer of 1956, the valley below the ski hill was the site of Bathurst Manor Day Camp, later Forest Valley Day Camp, and now a part of the Forest Valley Outdoor Education Centre. At its peak, it was the largest privately owned summer day camp in Canada, with over 900 campers, and operated through 1993. In 1973 the grade ten students from Downsview Secondary School built a suspension bridge across the ravine as part of their workshop experience. The bridge was dismantled some years later when it was considered an insurance liability. Beginning in 1998, Camp NAORCA summer camp operated by Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division moved here from its previous location at Seneca College, King Campus, and the Toronto District School Board uses this space during the school year to educate 21,000 students per year.

===Arts===
Several works from the collection of the Koffler Centre of the Arts was housed at the BJCC&#x27;s Koffler Gallery but now moved to their new home downtown at Artscape Youngplace. The centre also provided visual arts studios, music and dance schools, and the Leah Posluns Theatre which was then a 444-seat facility offering opera, theatre, dance, music and other cultural events. The Jewish Book Fair is held at the Centre annually.

Much of David Bezmozgis&#x27;s 2004 short story collection Natasha and Other Stories takes place in the general vicinity of the Bathurst Manor in the late 1980s. In one story, &quot;Roman Berman - Massage Therapist&quot;, the title character takes an office in the medical building at Bathurst Manor Plaza, which is still standing and in use. Bezmozgis&#x27;s narrator refers to the plaza as &quot;Sunnybrook Plaza&quot;, after its anchor store at the time. Author Stuart Ross, who grew up in Bathurst Manor, set most of his 2011 novel, &quot;Snowball, Dragonfly, Jew&quot; (ECW Press), in Bathurst Manor. The book centres on the fictional assassination of a neo-Nazi in Bathurst Manor Plaza. References are made to many streets in Bathurst Manor, as well as stores in the plaza.

===Retail===
The major strip mall, Sheppard Plaza, is located at the intersection of Sheppard Avenue and Bathurst Street.

There was also a smaller Bathurst Manor Plaza shopping centre at the intersection of Wilmington and Overbrook.

<doc id="1140155" wikidata="Q2303521" url="?curid=1140155" title="Nikasil">
<text>Nikasil is a trademarked electrodeposited lipophilic nickel matrix silicon carbide coating for engine components, mainly piston engine cylinder liners.

==Development==
Nikasil was introduced by Mahle in 1967 and was initially developed to allow Wankel engine apex seals to work directly against the aluminum block. This coating allowed aluminum cylinders and pistons to work directly against each other with low wear and friction. Unlike other methods, including cast iron cylinder liners, Nikasil allowed very large cylinder bores with tight tolerances. This made it possible for existing engine designs to be expanded easily. The aluminum cylinders also gave a much better heat conductivity and lower friction than cast iron liners, an important attribute for a high-output engine. The coating was further developed as a replacement for hard-chrome plated cylinder bores for Mercury Marine Racing, and Kohler Engines, and as a repair replacement for factory-chromed snowmobiles, dirt bikes, ATVs, watercraft, and automotive V8 liners/bores.

Nikasil is short for nickel silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is a very hard ceramic (much harder than steel) that can be dissolved in nickel. The nickel silicon carbide solution can then be electroplated onto the aluminium cylinder bore. After the cylinders are plated, the Nikasil bores are diamond-honed to a plateau finish. Pistons will need to be fitted with Nikasil compatible piston rings as chrome rings commonly used with cast iron bores are not compatible. Due to Nikasil&#x27;s hardness, the resulting cylinder bores are usually long-lived with less cylinder wear than other types of cylinders. As Nikasil is extremely durable, cylinders do not need to be reworked as often as you would an iron or chrome cylinder, usually only requiring deglazing before re-ringing. However, if there is damage to the plating, the cylinder must be stripped before it can be bored and re-plated.

==Applications==
Porsche started using Nikasil on the 1970 917 race car, and later on the 1973 911 RS. Porsche also used it on production cars, but for a short time switched to Alusil due to cost savings for their base 911. Nikasil cylinders were always used for the 911 Turbo and RS models. Nikasil coated aluminium cylinders allowed Porsche to build air-cooled engines that had the highest specific output of any engine of their time.

Nikasil was very popular in the 1990s. It was used by companies such as BMW, Ducati, Jaguar and Moto Guzzi in their new engine families. However, the sulfur found in much of the world&#x27;s low-quality gasoline caused some Nikasil cylinders to break down over time, causing costly engine failures. Porsche engines did suffer from many issues caused by high sulfur content fuels.

Nikasil or similar coatings under other trademarks are also still widely used in racing engines, including those used in Formula One and ChampCar. Suzuki uses a nickel phosphorus-silicon-carbide proprietary coating trademarked SCEM (Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material) to maximize cylinder size and improve heat dissipation in the TU250X, Hayabusa, Honda NX250 Enduro and other motorcycles.&lt;br&gt;
Radio-control glow-plug nitro engines commonly use a Nikasil coated sleeved cylinder and an aluminium alloy piston without any compression rings.

<text>William Nelson Page (January 6, 1854 – March 7, 1932) was an American civil engineer and industrialist. He was active in the Virginias following the U.S. Civil War. Page was widely known as a metallurgical expert by other industry leaders and investors as well as state and federal authorities.

William Page became one of the leading managers and developers of West Virginia&#x27;s rich bituminous coalfields in the late-19th and early-20th century, as well as being deeply involved in building the railroads and other infrastructure necessary to process and transport the mined coal. Page often worked as a manager for absentee owners, such as the British geological expert, Dr. David T. Ansted, and the New York City mayor, Abram S. Hewitt of the Cooper-Hewitt organization and other New York and Boston financiers.He also worked as the &quot;front man&quot; in projects involving a silent partner, such as Henry H. Rogers. In the town of Ansted, for 28 years, the Page family lived in a large Victorian mansion built by carpenters of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company.

Most notable among Page&#x27;s many accomplishments was a project to acquire land and construct a modest short-line railroad to tap new coal reserves in a rugged portion of southern West Virginia not yet reached by the bigger railroads. Connections planned to both the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) and the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W) should have inspired competition among rival carriers to transport the coal the rest of the way to market. However, collusion by the leaders of the large railroads attempted to stop the project through agreeing to only offer Page unprofitable rates. Instead of giving up, working with Rogers discreetly providing the millions needed for financing, William Page and his associates expanded the &quot;short line&quot; all the way hundred of miles across the Virginias to a new coal pier built on Hampton Roads, creating the Virginian Railway. Completed in 1909, the VGN was built to be very efficient and during the first half of the 20th century, became widely known as the &quot;Richest Little Railroad in the World.&quot;

William and Emma completed their lives in Washington D.C., where they moved in 1917 as he served as a mining expert before federal regulators. One of their younger sons, Randolph Gilham &quot;Dizzy&quot; Page, was an early pioneer of the U.S. air mail industry during this time until his death of a heart attack at 36. William and Emma died in 1932 and 1933 respectively, and were interred in Richmond, Virginia&#x27;s Hollywood Cemetery.

==Early life, heritage of public service==

William Nelson Page was born at &quot;Locust Grove&quot; in Campbell County, Virginia on January 6, 1854 into an old Virginia family. His parents were Edwin Randolph Page (1822–1864) and Olivia (née Alexander) Page (1820–1896), a scion of the Nelson family. He descended from historic roots; the Nelson and Page families were each among the &quot;First Families of Virginia&quot;, families who were prominent in the Virginia Colony.

Through the Nelson family, he was a descendant of Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter (1663–1732), who served as an acting royal governor of Virginia and was one of its wealthiest landowners in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. After the American Revolutionary War, two of his great-grandfathers served as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Some years later, in 1905, another relative, Logan Waller Page, became the first head of the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads, an early precursor of the agency which became the U.S. Department of Transportation. Logan Page served as an energetic advocate of the country&#x27;s early interstate highway system until his death in 1918.

Although his father died in 1861, and notwithstanding the financial hardships which were widespread in the South brought on by the Civil War which began that year, from a family base in Rockbridge and Augusta counties, where his mother and siblings relocated, young William Nelson Page was educated at the University of Virginia as a civil engineer.

After the cessation of hostilities in 1865, as he launched his career, he participated in some local politics and civic activities, but primarily directed his considerable energies into developing transportation and mineral resources in the mountainous regions of Virginia and the newly formed state of West Virginia. Between 1871 and 1876, William Page played a role in engineering and building the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O), which was under the leadership of Collis P. Huntington. Initially, he led one of the surveying parties charged with mapping the route of a double-track railway that had been ordered by Congress. This new railway was expected to run between Richmond, Virginia and the Ohio River (at what became Huntington, West Virginia), via the valleys of the James River and Jackson River in Virginia, and the New River and Kanawha River in West Virginia. He chose the location and directed the construction of several important C&amp;O bridges. While working with the C&amp;O, Page became fascinated with the potential of the untapped mineral resources of West Virginia.

==Family and children==
William&#x27;s father, a farmer, died in 1862, but his education continued. Olivia Page, William&#x27;s widowed mother, owned several farms in Rockbridge County, Virginia, where she relocated. Both William and Emma had roots in the central Shenandoah Valley area named for nearby Natural Bridge.

His future wife, Emma Hayden Gilham (1855–1933), had been born at Lexington in Rockbridge County, Virginia. She was the youngest daughter of Major William Gilham, a former Commandant of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). Emma&#x27;s parents moved to Richmond at the outset of the American Civil War, where her father helped with Virginia and Confederate troop training. after the end of hostilities in 1865, he worked for a fertilizer company. He died in 1872.

On February 8, 1882, Page married Emma Hayden Gilham (1855–1933) in Richmond, Virginia. By this time, William had become well-established in the region and had been named as General Manager and a Director of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company at the urging of an old friend and trustee, attorney Thomas D. Ransom of Staunton, Virginia.

Emma and William settled in the town of Ansted in Fayette County, West Virginia, where they raised their family, which included four children who lived beyond infancy. Their palatial white Victorian mansion was built by Gauley Mountain Coal Company carpenters, on a knoll in the middle of town. Later known as the Page-Vawter House, it remained has been preserved and restored and remained as a community landmark as of 2010.

==Entrepreneur and developer==

A knowledgeable man with the training and experience as a civil engineer and the spirit of an entrepreneur, Page was well-prepared to help develop West Virginia&#x27;s hidden wealth: huge deposits of &quot;smokeless&quot; bituminous coal, a product exceptionally well-suited for making steel. Former West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land &quot;as a farmer knows a field.&quot;

Page became a protégé of Dr. David T. Ansted, a noted British geologist with large land holdings in southern West Virginia. As his career developed, Page busied himself with many enterprises to develop the natural resources which lay all around him, primarily working with iron and coal operations, often as the manager for absentee owners.

He was the general manager of the Hawks Nest Coal Co. between 1877 and 1880, superintendent of the Victoria Blast Furnace at Goshen, Virginia from 1880 to 1885, and he located and built the Powellton bridge for the C&amp;O between 1885 and 1889. After developing the Mt. Carbon Collieries, he organized and developed the Gauley Mountain Coal Company, and he became a consulting engineer for other coal-producing firms as well. He was also involved with the Virginia and Pittsburgh Land Association (a land development company) and the Pittsburgh and Virginia Railroad Company.

Of course, with his background with the C&amp;O, Page was intensely interested in railroads, and he gained even more practical railroad experience after winning the contract to convert the C&amp;O branch-line track, from the New River main line, up the mountainside to Ansted, to standard gauge. The project was completed on 20 August 1890, at a cost of $35,038.44.

He was later a principal of the Page Coal and Coke Company.

==The &quot;idea man from Ansted&quot;==
William and Emma Page settled their family in the tiny mountain hamlet of Ansted, a town with a population of 2,000 (named for Dr. Ansted) located in Fayette County, West Virginia. Ansted sits on high bluffs on Gauley Mountain near an outcropping of rocks called Hawk&#x27;s Nest overlooking the New River far below, where the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway tracks occupied both sides of the narrow valley. In the late 1870s, Emma and William&#x27;s widowed mother, Olivia Page, who had come to live with them, were influential in establishing the Church of the Redeemer, the Episcopal Church in Ansted.

In 1889, while he was president of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company, Page had a palatial white Victorian mansion built by company carpenters on a knoll in the middle of town. Architect William Minter designed the house in a Gothic style. It has 15 regular rooms, plus a butler&#x27;s pantry and a dressing room. There are 11 fireplaces with hand-carved wooden mantels; most are in different styles. Even the doors have ornately decorated hinges. The exterior features 52 8-foot-tall windows. The mansion, now known as the Page-Vawter House, became a symbol of wealth and power. It remains a community landmark over 100 years later.

&quot;Colonel&quot; Page, as he became known, was in truth, a uniformed captain and later a major in a locally recruited Spanish–American War militia. (&quot;Colonel&quot; was an honorific title used informally in the South for many notable men in the years following the American Civil War). A colorful character by all accounts, he was described as a slight man who was known for his handlebar mustache, pince-nez glasses, iron bowler derby, and elegant suits. He was considered to be somewhat aloof by the local population, and could frequently be seen riding a bicycle on the sloping lawn of the mansion, where eight servants were employed.

Described years later by author H. Reid as &quot;the idea man from Ansted,&quot; Page spent long hours working in the den just off the main entrance to his resplendent home. In addition to pursuing business interests, Page also found time to serve as the mayor of Ansted for 10 years and rose to the rank of brigadier inspector general in the West Virginia National Guard. In 1907, he was named as the first president of Ansted National Bank. He was also an incorporator and director of Sheltering Arms Hospital in neighboring Kanawha County.

However, of all of his many activities, William Nelson Page is probably best known for the founding and building of the Virginian Railway (VGN). It started much like just another of his many projects, but would ultimately grow far beyond its original scope. The story of the building of the Virginian Railway has been described as a textbook example of natural resources, railroads, and a smaller company taking on big business (and winning) early in the 20th century.

==Building the Virginian Railway==

Some historians will hold that the Loup Creek enterprise originally was planned to be just another local mining operation, one that would ship primary product, coal, out of the region via the common carrier railroads. Officially, it was only after problems arose that the plan was expanded to build and operate rail connections, or even build all the way to the sea. This is the version Page used in an I.C.C. hearing.

However, other historians believe that a goal of the plan from the outset was to transport from the mineheads to reach a shipping point without using these common carriers, who as owners of vast coal lands and many mines, were also competitors. There was a lot at stake, as the C&amp;O and the N&amp;W through the secret &quot;community of interests&quot; pact were carefully controlling coal shipping rates. A non-affiliated competitor would threaten that cozy relationship.

==The Virginian Railway==

Most notable among Page&#x27;s many projects was a partnership with absentee investors, begun in 1898, to acquire land and construct a modest short-line railroad to tap new coal reserves in a rugged portion of southern West Virginia not yet reached by the bigger railroads. The project was intended to establish connections to both the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) and the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W), which should have inspired competition among rival carriers to transport the coal the rest of the way to market. However, collusion by the leaders of the large railroads (lawful in an era before U.S. anti-trust laws were enacted) resulted in rates to transport the coal the additional distances to markets which, potentially, would have stopped the project.

However, if the C&amp;O and N&amp;W presidents thought they could discourage Page from developing the new areas, they were mistaken. One of the investors Page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a principal in John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil Trust. A master at competitive &quot;warfare&quot;, Henry Rogers did not like to lose, and, as one of the wealthiest men in America, he also had nearly unlimited resources.

While Page continued to meet with the big railroads for rate negotiations that always seemed unproductive, he and Rogers secretly planned a route and acquired rights-of-way all of the way across Virginia to Hampton Roads, a distance of some . By the time they realized what was happening, the C&amp;O and N&amp;W executives were faced with a new major competitor, a third railroad with direct access to an ocean port.

===Victoria is created===

Late in 1906, near the halfway point on the Tidewater Railway between Roanoke and Sewell&#x27;s Point, a new town with space set aside for railroad offices and shops was created in Lunenburg County, Virginia. It was named Victoria, in honor of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who was long-admired by Henry Rogers.

Victoria was the location of a large equipment maintenance operation, with roundhouse, turntable, coaling and water facilities for servicing steam locomotives, a large rail yard with many tracks, and a large single-story passenger station. Offices for the VGN&#x27;s Norfolk Division were built by adding a second floor to the passenger station building a few years later.

===Virginian Railway born, Jamestown Exposition===
Early in 1907, with substantial portions of each still under construction, the Deepwater and Tidewater Railways were combined to become the Virginian Railway. On April 15, 1907, William Nelson Page was elected as its first president.

About the same time, a large stretch of the eastern portion of the Tidewater had been completed and regular passenger service was established between Norfolk and Victoria. This proved just in time for the new railroad to serve the Jamestown Exposition, which was held on land adjacent to the VGN coal pier site at Sewell&#x27;s Point. At the exposition, Page served as Chief of International Jury of Awards, Mines and Metallurgy.

On April 26, 1907, US President Theodore Roosevelt opened the exposition. Mark Twain was another honored guest, arriving with his friend Henry Rogers on the latter&#x27;s steam yacht, the &quot;Kanawha&quot;. In addition to President Roosevelt, the newly renamed Virginian Railway (VGN) transported many of the 3 million persons who attended before the Exposition closed on December 1, 1907.

===Financial panic of 1907 – Rogers has stroke===
Work progressed on the VGN during 1907 and 1908 using construction techniques not available when the larger railroads had been built about 25 years earlier, achieving a more favorable route and grade. By paying for work with Henry Rogers&#x27; own personal fortune, the railway was built with no public debt. This feat, a key feature of the successful secrecy in securing the route, was in all likelihood not part of Rogers&#x27; initial planning, and was not accomplished without some considerable burden to the financier, however. He had suffered some setbacks in the Financial Panic of 1907 which began in March of that year. Then, a few months later, he experienced a debilitating apoplectic stroke. Fortunately, Henry Rogers recovered his health, at least partially, and saw to it that construction was continued on the new railroad until it was finally completed early in 1909.

===Final spike, celebrations===

The final spike in the VGN was driven on 29 January 1909, at the west end of the massive New River Bridge at Glen Lyn, near where the new railroad crossed the West Virginia-Virginia state line. The former Deepwater and Tidewater Railways were now physically connected.

In April, 1909, Henry Huttleston Rogers and Mark Twain, old friends, returned to Norfolk together once again for a huge celebration of the new &quot;Mountains to the Sea&quot; railroad&#x27;s completion. Despite rain that day, a huge crowd of Norfolk citizens was waiting with great excitement at the shore to meet them. While Rogers toured the railway&#x27;s new $2.5-million coal pier at Sewell&#x27;s Point, Mark Twain spoke to groups of students at several local schools. That night, at a grand banquet held in downtown Norfolk, the city&#x27;s civic leaders, Mark Twain, Rogers, and other dignitaries spoke. In either event, with the building of the VGN, what was accomplished was that a third shipper was established.

Rogers left the next day on his first (and only) tour of the newly completed railroad. He died suddenly, only six weeks later, at the age of 69, at his home in New York, because of another stroke. By then, the work of the Page-Rogers partnership in Building the Virginian Railway was complete.

==Accomplishments==
While neither William Page nor Henry Rogers ended up running their newly completed Virginian Railway, it was arguably a crowning lifetime achievement for each man. Together, they had conceived and built a modern, well-engineered rail pathway from the coal mines of West Virginia to port at Hampton Roads right under the noses of the big railroads. The Virginian Railway could operate more efficiently than its larger competitors, had all new infrastructure, and no debt. It was an accomplishment like no other in the history of US railroading, before or since.

The new railroad opened up isolated communities in both West Virginia and Virginia and soon helped develop new coalfields and other industries.

Throughout its profitable 50-year history, the VGN continued to follow the Page-Rogers policy of &quot;paying up front for the best.&quot; It became particularly well known for treating its employees and vendors well, another investment which paid rich dividends. The VGN operated some of the largest and most innovative steam, electric, and diesel locomotives, and could afford to, earning the nickname &quot;Richest Little Railroad in the World.&quot;

In time, the big railroads learned to coexist with their newer competitor, and came to regret turning down opportunities to purchase it before completion. There were many failed attempts by each of them and others to acquire the VGN.

Eventually, the owners of the VGN agreed to merge with arch-rival Norfolk and Western Railway in 1959. In 2004, much of the former Virginian Railway is still in use by N&amp;W successor Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The well-engineered low-gradient VGN route helps NS compete efficiently with rival CSX Transportation (successor to the VGN&#x27;s old rival C&amp;O) and non-rail transport modes in the transportation markets of the 21st century.

==The latter years==
After the Virginian Railway had been completed, Page busied himself with the coal-mining business in West Virginia, until he retired in 1917. He and his family then moved to Washington, D.C. William Nelson Page died at his home in Washington, in 1932, at the age of 78. He was interred in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, where his wife, Emma, who died the following 14 February, is also buried.

==Ancestry==

===Nelson family lineage===
The Nelson lineage in Virginia began with Thomas &quot;Scotch Tom&quot; Nelson (1677–1745), a Scottish immigrant who settled at Yorktown in 1690. He was from Penrith (in present-day Cumbria). His son, William Nelson (1711–1772) was a royal governor of Virginia. William Nelson&#x27;s son, Thomas Nelson, Jr. (1739–1789) (grandson of &quot;Scotch Tom&quot;) was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a Brigadier General during the American Revolutionary War and a governor after statehood.

Nelson County, Kentucky (formerly in Virginia before Kentucky became a state), Nelson County, Virginia and Thomas Nelson Community College in the Virginia Peninsula subregion of Hampton Roads are each named in honor of Thomas Nelson, Jr. His son, Hugh Nelson (1768–1836) would later serve in the U.S. Congress. The circa 1730 Nelson House built by &quot;Scotch Tom&quot; Nelson in Yorktown, Virginia is a National Historical Landmark maintained by the Colonial National Historical Park of the U.S. National Park Service.

===Page family lineage===

The Page family lineage in Virginia began even earlier, in 1650, with the arrival from England of Colonel John Page (1628–1692) at Jamestown. He was from Middlesex (in the present London borough of Hounslow). Colonel Page was a prominent leader and developer of Middle Plantation, which became the site of the new College of William and Mary (chartered in 1693). Middle Plantation was soon thereafter designated as the new state capital and renamed Williamsburg.

The Page family included Mann Page (1749–1781), who became a U.S. Congressman in the new nation, as well as Governor John Page (1744–1808), who had grown up at Rosewell Plantation in Gloucester County. He was a classmate at the College of William and Mary with a young Thomas Jefferson, who stayed at his home while working on the early documents relating to independence for Virginia and the other colonies.

Later notable members of the Page family included U.S. Navy officer (and later Confederate Naval Commander and Army Brigadier General Richard Lucian Page (1807–1901) of Clarke County, Virginia, and William&#x27;s cousin, writer and U.S. Ambassador Thomas Nelson Page (1853–1922).

In Williamsburg, Virginia, Page Street is named for Colonel John Page. Page County, Virginia was named in honor of Governor John Page.

===Young cousins: Thomas Nelson Page and William Nelson Page===

Among young William Nelson Page&#x27;s contemporaries born in the mid-19th century was his first cousin, Thomas Nelson Page (1853–1922), of Beaverdam in Hanover County. Although once among Virginia&#x27;s wealthy elite, their respective family fortunes had diminished greatly by the time cousins William and Thomas Page were teenagers after the American Civil War devastated Virginia&#x27;s economy.

Conflicts and battles of the War ravaged the area all around Thomas&#x27; home, while William&#x27;s family lived about to the southwest, in an area of the state less directly impacted. However, during the War, when William was only 10 years old, his father, Edwin Randolph Page, died at their home &quot;Locust Grove&quot; in Campbell County, where he is interred in a family cemetery. William had two sisters, one slightly older, one younger, when his father died.

The Page cousins, Thomas and William, were each educated by the University of Virginia. Thomas, educated as a lawyer, was to gain fame writing of the &quot;lost era&quot; and an idealized antebellum Virginia (a style which became known as the plantation tradition genre). In addition to practicing law, he also served as a politician. In the administration of President Woodrow Wilson, he was the U.S. ambassador to Italy during World War I.

Meanwhile, William, a year younger, was tutored at home as a youngster, and then was sent to Northern Virginia where he attended Leesburg Academy in the Town of Leesburg, county seat of Loudoun county, and not far from the home of his paternal grandparents in Clarke County. He then attended special courses in engineering of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and became a civil engineer.

===Page&#x27;s wife, Emma, and her family===
William Page&#x27;s wife, Emma, was one of seven children of Major William Gilham and his wife, Cordelia A Gilham. In 1860, her father prepared a well-known training manual for recruits and militia at the request of Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise, and was involved with early training of cadets at Camp Lee in Richmond, Virginia as the American Civil War broke out the following year.

After the War ended in 1865, William Gilham became president of fertilizer company in Richmond. Emma spent her teen-aged years in the former Confederate capital, where she was a débutante at one of Richmond&#x27;s earliest &quot;Germans&quot;, which were formal social gatherings for the young people (the name of these events had no relationship to Germany). She was the sister of Julius Hayden Gilham (1852–1936) who is also buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

William Page and Emma Gilham both had roots and family in the Augusta County and Rockbridge County area of the upper Shenandoah Valley. (William&#x27;s married sister lived in Staunton, Virginia.) They had four children who survived childhood: Delia Hayden Page (born 1882), Edwin Randolph Page (1884–1949), Mary Josephine Page (1893–1962), and Randolph Gilham Page (1893–1930). They also had two other children who died in infancy: Evan Powell Page (born 1887) and William Gilham Page (born 1890).

==Legacy==

The unincorporated West Virginia coal and railroad towns of Page in Fayette County and Pageton in McDowell County were named for him. The Page Coal and Coke Company operated in each, although coal mining has long since ended. The old company store in Pageton is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the 21st century, William and Emma&#x27;s mansion, now known as the Page-Vawter House, still stands in Ansted, on a high knoll, overlooking the town and the New River Valley. It is evidence of the once-thriving coal business. Later occupied by the Vawter family, the Page-Vawter House is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nearby, breathtaking Hawk&#x27;s Nest overlooks the New River Gorge National River.

The seemingly remotely located terminal Page and Rogers planned and built at Sewell&#x27;s Point played an important role in 20th-century U.S. naval history. Beginning in 1917, the former Jamestown Exposition grounds adjacent to the VGN coal pier became an important facility for the United States Navy. The VGN transported the high quality &quot;smokeless&quot; West Virginia bituminous coal favored by the US Navy for its ships and submarines, providing a reliable supply during both World Wars. Today, the former VGN property at Sewell&#x27;s Point is part of the Norfolk Navy Base, the largest naval facility in the world.
After Page retired in 1917, a ship was named in his honor. &quot;William N. Page&quot; was a steamship built at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Ship Building and Dry Dock Corp. It was taken over by the US Navy for operation by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and commissioned on December 18, 1918. After fitting out, &quot;William N. Page&quot; loaded general cargo and locomotives and departed for France. It made several transatlantic trips through the treacherous German U-boat infested waters before finally returning to Norfolk where on May 31, 1919, it was decommissioned by the Navy. After its brief naval career, the &quot;William N. Page&quot; remained in active merchant service for nearly three decades. Its successive owners and operators included the Mystic Steamship Co., the Koppers Coal Co., and Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates. The latter two companies were majority owners of the Virginian Railway after purchasing a controlling interest from Rogers&#x27; heirs in 1936.

Formed in 2002, Virginian Railway (VGN) Enthusiasts a non-profit group of preservationists, authors, photographers, historians, modelers, and rail fans, has grown to over 650 members. Members come from as far from the VGN tracks as Australia and include U.S. troops stationed in the war-torn Middle East. A group of retired railroaders calling themselves &quot;The Virginian Brethren&quot; meet weekly, share tales of the VGN, and answer questions posed by members of the on-line group.

In 2005, the initials &quot;H.H.R.&quot; and &#x27;W.N.P.&quot; were engraved in the rails of a short stretch of new roadbead laid for a caboose to be displayed at Victoria, a town they caused to be founded on the &quot;Mountains to Sea&quot; railroad. Their Virginian Railway has turned out to be a lasting tribute, both to Henry Huttleston Rogers, and to William Nelson Page, the &quot;Idea Man from Ansted&quot;.

<text>Denver Union Station is the main railway station and central transportation hub in Denver, Colorado. It is located at 17th and Wynkoop Streets in the present-day LoDo district and includes the historic station house, a modern open-air train shed, a 22-gate underground bus station, and light rail station. A station was first opened on the site on June 1, 1881, but burned down in 1894. The current structure was erected in two stages, with an enlarged central portion completed in 1914.

In 2012, the station underwent a major renovation transforming it into the centerpiece of a new transit-oriented mixed-use development built on the site&#x27;s former railyards. The historic station house reopened in the summer of 2014, hosting the 112-room Crawford Hotel, restaurants and retailers.

==History==

===19th century: Original structures===

Denver&#x27;s first train station was constructed in 1868 to serve the new Denver Pacific Railway, which connected Denver to the main transcontinental line at Cheyenne, Wyoming. By 1875, there were four different railroad stations, making passenger transfers between different railroad lines inconvenient. To remedy this issue, the Union Pacific Railroad proposed creating one central &quot;Union Station&quot; to combine the various operations. In February 1880, the owners of the four lines (the Union Pacific, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande, the Denver, South Park &amp; Pacific and the Colorado Central) agreed to build a station at 17th and Wynkoop Streets. Architect A. Taylor of Kansas City was hired to develop the plans and the station opened in May 1881.

A fire that started in the women&#x27;s restroom in 1894 destroyed the central portion of the 1881 depot. The Kansas City architectural firm of Van Brunt &amp; Howe was hired to design a larger replacement depot in the Romanesque Revival style. Both the 1881 and 1894 depots included a tall central clock tower with four clock faces.

===Early 20th century===
On July 4, 1906, a large arch was dedicated in front of the station in order to provide a symbolic threshold for travelers entering and leaving the city. Constructed at a cost of $22,500 with 70 tons of steel and over 2,000 light bulbs, the arch originally featured the word &quot;Welcome&quot; on both sides. The elevation facing 17th Street was changed to &quot;Mizpah&quot;, a Hebrew word expressing an emotional bond between separated people, and used as a farewell to people leaving Denver.

In 1912, the original Union Depot partnership was dissolved and replaced by the Denver Terminal Railway Company, representing the then-major operators of the station (the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, the Colorado &amp; Southern, the Union Pacific and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western railways). The new partnership decided to demolish and rebuild the central portion of the station to handle the increasing passenger traffic. The new central portion, designed by Denver architects Gove &amp; Walsh, was built in the Beaux-Arts style and opened in 1914.

By the 1920s and 1930s, over 80 trains served the station daily with notable dignitaries such as Queen Marie of Romania, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Franklin Delano Roosevelt arriving to Denver through the station. As a result of growing passenger service, the Mizpah Arch in front of the station was deemed a traffic hazard and was torn down in 1931.

===Late 20th century: Decline===

Although World War II saw a surge in rail traffic, the latter half of the 20th century saw a sharp decline in service for Union Station and countless other train stations in the United States as competition began to grow from automobiles and airlines.

For the first time in 1958, passenger traffic at Stapleton International Airport exceeded that of Union Station. It was during this period that the orange &quot;Union Station: Travel by Train&quot; signs were placed on both sides of the building to advertise intercity rail travel.

Amtrak eventually became the sole provider of rail service through the station, operating only two trains daily between Chicago and the Bay Area with the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, RTD, the City and County of Denver, the original site owner Denver Union Terminal Railway Corporation, and several other entities made periodic improvements such as accommodating an RTD bus lane to access Market Street Station from I-25 and a light rail connection.

The station also served special trains such as the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad&#x27;s Ski Train, which operated until the end of the winter of 2008–2009; in September 2009, plans were announced to revive the service as a special limited route beginning in December, but this fell through due to insurance problems. The ski train returned for the 2022 ski season with weekend service during the peak ski season.

Until the grand renovation, the station served the annual &quot;Cheyenne Frontier Days Train&quot;, which runs between Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming, for the Frontier Days Rodeo event. The popular excursion train was later relocated to a site near the Denver Coliseum, where it continued to operate until being discontinued in 2019.

===21st century: Renovations===

====Redevelopment====
In 2001, the Regional Transit District (RTD), in partnership with the City of Denver and the State of Colorado bought the station and the 19 acres it sat on.  In 2004, the Fast Tracks tax increase passed which provided the funding needed to complete a new regional commuter station at site.  In 2009, construction began on the new rail platforms pursuant to a masterplan lead by local development team of Continuum Partners and East West Partners.  In 2012, construction began on a major renovation of the historic building transforming it into the centerpiece of a new transit-oriented mixed-use development built on the site&#x27;s former railyards. The historic station house reopened in the summer of 2014, hosting the 112-room Crawford Hotel, restaurants and retailers.

After a competition in 2006, the Partner Agencies selected a joint venture of Continuum Partners and East West Partners to be &quot;the master developers&quot; of the entire site. Its plan called for the transit elements connected to Union Station in the master plan to be constructed in one single phase at an estimated cost of $500 million. In 2008, Hargreaves Associates and Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill were selected to design the public spaces including the landscape, train hall, bus terminal, and light rail station. The project received a $300 million grant from the United States Department of Transportation on July 30, 2010, to help fund construction of three light-rail tracks and eight heavy-rail tracks for both Amtrak and commuter rail services, as well as additional storage and servicing capabilities.

As construction at the site commenced in 2010, Amtrak&#x27;s passenger station and boarding platform were moved on February 1, 2011, to a temporary site at 21st and Wewatta streets, behind Coors Field. The new light rail station was the first component of the project to open on August 15, 2011, two blocks west of the former light rail stations and adjacent to the consolidated main line railroad tracks near the Denver Millennium Bridge. The westernmost stop of the 16th Street MallRide shuttle, was also moved west adjacent to the new light rail stop.

Amtrak trains started serving the new open air train hall on February 28, 2014, while the new underground 22-gate Bus Concourse opened on May 11, 2014. The new bus concourse replaced Market Street Station at 16th St. &amp; Market St., which closed permanently after thirty years of use as a hub for RTD buses. Bustang served Union Station Bus Concourse since its launch in 2015. In 2020, Greyhound Lines moved their Denver station from a terminal on 19th Street to the Union Station Bus Concourse. Other intercity bus lines at the Bus Concourse are Burlington Trailways and Express Arrow.

Commuter rail service at the new train hall began in April 2016 with the opening of the A Line, offering a connection to Denver International Airport, running every 15 minutes during peak hours with a travel time of approximately 37 minutes. Service between Denver and Westminster began in July 2016 on the first segment of the B Line, which runs every 30 minutes during peak hours. The travel time between the two stations is approximately 11 minutes. Service to Wheat Ridge on the G Line began in April 2019, with an end-to-end travel time of 27 minutes. Service to Thornton on the N Line started in September 2020, with an end-to-end runtime of 29 minutes.

==== Restoration of the historic station house ====

Simultaneous with the construction of its surrounding site, the historic station house also underwent a complete renovation. In 2011, a competition between the Denver Union Station Neighborhood Company and the Union Station Alliance (consisting of local firms Urban Neighborhoods Inc., Sage Hospitality, Larimer Associates, REGen, llc. and McWhinney) created different proposals for the future use of the structure. Both plans called for maintaining a waiting area for transit and spaces for Amtrak, the creation of retail spaces, and integrating the interior spaces with the public plazas facing the station. However, the Denver Union Station Neighborhood plan also envisioned a public market and commercial office space while the Union Station Alliance called for the integration of an independent hotel with an emphasis on creating the Great Hall as &quot;Denver&#x27;s Living Room&quot;.

By 2012, RTD selected the proposal from the Union Station Alliance to renovate the structure as a hotel at a cost of $54 million with retail, public, and transit facilities and approved a 99-year lease for its redevelopment.

The main historic building closed to the public on December 1, 2012, for construction and re-opened July 26, 2014. The majority of the terminal building&#x27;s upper levels have now become the 112-room Crawford Hotel, with the Great Hall on the ground level serving as the hotel lobby, public space, and train waiting room and an additional of the ground level serving as 10 independent retail and restaurant spaces.

====Future====
A stop at Union Station has been included in most proposals for Front Range Passenger Rail, an under-development inter-city rail service that would connect Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, and Cheyenne. Alternate proposals would have the service bypass Union Station and downtown Denver, instead stopping at Denver Airport station.

==Architecture==

===Layout===

As an inter-modal transportation hub, Denver Union Station consists of the historic terminal building and, on the site&#x27;s former rail yards, an open-air train hall, a 22-gate underground bus terminal, and a light rail station. The train hall stands immediately behind the historic building and houses tracks for Amtrak and the commuter rail lines. An entrance between the train hall and the historic building lead directly to the underground bus terminal, which stretches west for two city blocks along 17th Street until it terminates at an above-ground light rail station. Street-level pavilions at the light rail stop/Chestnut Place, Wewatta Street and at each platform in the train hall provide additional vertical circulation to the bus terminal.

Each of these transportation elements are tied together above ground by major public spaces and landscape elements such as the 17 St. Promenade/Gardens, Wynkoop Plaza and several other public plazas.

Historically, a subterranean passage accessed through the northern wing building connected the station to the old rail platforms above. However, the passage and its entrance was demolished with the construction of the bus terminal.

===Historic building===

The present-day Union Station building consists mainly of two lower wing buildings flanking a larger central mass built during different parts of the station&#x27;s history. The wing buildings were built with the first 1881 structure in a Romanesque Revival style, featuring tall, narrow windows, rusticated stonework and motifs of Colorado&#x27;s state flower, the columbine. When the station was gutted by the 1894 fire, the facades of the wing buildings were incorporated into the 1894 depot and the 1914 renovation. They originally functioned as offices and other facilities for the station through its history, although today the structures house guestrooms for the Crawford Hotel and several restaurants.

When originally constructed, the Great Hall also included three large chandeliers and ten long wooden benches that incorporated heating and lighting into their framework. While the renovation saw the return of similar chandeliers as the originals, it also saw the removal of the benches due to asbestos.
Other modifications made during 2012 included changing the brown and tan color scheme of the interior to a more neutral white. The old ticket counters and offices were also converted into the Terminal Bar along with several retail and restaurant spaces being created on the periphery of and opening on to the Great Hall. In general, the 2012 renovation sought to create &quot;Denver&#x27;s Living Room&quot; in the Great Hall by diversifying its functions. It functions today as part hotel lobby, part Amtrak, part waiting area, part retail, and part public space.

<text>Dr. John Garang De Mabior (June 23, 1945 – July 30, 2005) was a Sudanese politician and revolutionary leader. From 1983 to 2005, he led the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M, Now known as South Sudan People&#x27;s Defense Forces) as a commander in chief during the Second Sudanese Civil War. He served as First Vice President of Sudan for three weeks, from the comprehensive peace agreement of 2005 until his death in a helicopter crash on July 30, 2005. A developmental economist by profession, Garang was one of the major influences on the movement that led to the foundation of South Sudan’s independence from the rule of Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir.

==Early life and education==
John Garang was born on 23 June 1945 into a poor family in Wangulei village, Twic East County, in the Upper Nile region of Sudan. A member of the Dinka ethnic group and an orphan by the age of ten, he had his fees for school paid by a relative, going to schools in Wau and then Rumbek. In 1962, he joined the separatist rebels of southern Sudan during the First Sudanese Civil War. However, due to his young age, the rebel leaders encouraged him and others of his age to pursue higher education and because of the ongoing fighting, Garang was forced to complete his secondary school education in Tanzania. After winning a scholarship, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Economics in 1969 from Grinnell College in Iowa, United States.

He was offered another scholarship to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, but chose to return to Tanzania and study East African agricultural economics as a Thomas J. Watson Fellow at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). At UDSM, he was a member of the University Students&#x27; African Revolutionary Front. However, Garang soon returned to Sudan and joined the Anyanya rebels. There is much erroneous reporting that Garang met and befriended Yoweri Museveni, future president of Uganda, at this time; while both Garang and Museveni were students at UDSM in the 1960s, they did not attend at the same time. In 1970, Garang was in one of the batches of Gordon Muortat Mayen&#x27;s soldiers, the then leader of the Anyanya rebel group, sent to Israel for military training.

The civil war ended with the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972 and Garang, like many rebels, was absorbed into the Sudanese military. For eleven years, he was a career soldier and rose from the rank of captain to colonel after taking the Infantry Officers Advanced Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States. During this period, he took four years of academic leave and received a Master&#x27;s degree in agricultural economics from Iowa State University (ISU). In 1981, he earned a PhD. in Economics from Iowa State University (ISU). By 1983, Garang was serving as a senior instructor in the military academy in Wadi Sayedna 21 km from the centre of Omdurman where he instructed the cadets for more than four years. Later, he was nominated to serve in the military research department at Army HQ in Khartoum.

==Political ideology==
Garang coined the philosophy of &quot;Sudanism&quot; which would be the guiding philosophy to a secular and multiethnic New Sudan. He believed, for the people of Sudan to live in cohesion, they must not separate themselves into the many existing ethnic factions present within the nation but, rather, to collectively renounce the belief that Black African-ness, Islam, or Christianity were to be the ultimate defining characteristics of Sudan. Rather, he willed that citizens should embrace all cultures of Sudan, including the creation of further pagan involvement into Sudanese life, a policy embraced by many of Sudan&#x27;s elite, and to unify under the one commonality they all share, being Sudanese and coming from a background of Judaism, Christianity and Paganism.

==Rebel leader==

In 1983, Garang went to Bor and southern government soldiers in Battalion 105 who were resisting being rotated to posts in the north. Although he was not among the officers in the Southern command arranging for the defection of Battalion 105 to the anti government rebels, he was supporting the revolution. When the 105 Battalion attacked Sudanese army in Bor on 16 May 1983 under the command of Major Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, who was the leader of the budding movement which launched an impromptu attack, Garang rode by an alternative route to join them in the rebel stronghold in Ethiopia. Major Kerubino Kuanyin Bol and William Nyuon Bany Machar led Battalion 105 and 107 in Bor and Ayot, respectively. As a major, Kerubino coalesced with William to organize a revolt and opened routes to Ethiopian plains. By the end of July, Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA) had brought over 3000 soldiers into the newly created Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M), which was opposed to military rule and Islamic dominance of the country, and encouraged other army garrisons to mutiny against the Islamic law imposed on the country by the government. William Nyuon Bany and Kerubino Kwanyin Bol were both founding members of SPLA. Bany was appointed the 3rd high-ranking Commander after Bol.

This action marked the commonly agreed upon beginning of the Second Sudanese Civil War, which resulted in one and a half million deaths over twenty years of conflict. Although Garang was Christian and most of southern Sudan is non-Muslim (mostly animist), he did not initially focus on the religious aspects of the war.

Garang was a strong advocate for national unity: minorities together formed a majority and, therefore should rule. Together, Garang believed, they could replace President Omar al-Bashir with a government made up of representatives from “all tribes and religions in Sudan.&quot; His first real effort for the cause, under his command, occurred in July 1985 with the SPLA’s incursion into Kordofan.

The SPLA gained the backing of Libya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Garang and his army controlled a large part of the southern regions of the country, named &quot;New Sudan&quot;. He claimed his troops&#x27; courage came from &quot;the conviction that we are fighting a just cause. That is something North Sudan and its people don&#x27;t have.&quot; Critics suggested financial motivations to his rebellion, noting that much of Sudan&#x27;s oil wealth lies in the south of the country.

In early 1991, Mengistu Haile Mariam&#x27;s regime (in Ethiopia) was overthrown by the Khartoum-backed Ethiopian rebels (Ethiopian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Democratic Front). Upon the rebels’ seizure of the government, they closed all SPLA training camps in Ethiopia and cut off the SPLA&#x27;s arms supply, forcing the SPLA to return hundreds of thousands of Sudanese back to South Sudan. This disrupted military operations and leadership within the SPLA. However, this caused the West to reconsider relations with the SPLA – justifying their providing the SPLA with &quot;non-lethal help.&quot;

Shortly after, there were leadership misunderstandings between Garang and senior SPLA commanders, Riek Machar and Lam Akol in August 1991. The splinter group led by Machar and Akol was named the SPLA-Nasir. This resulted in Dinka Massacre which raged civilians and exposed the deep ethnic divides within the SPLA. The Southern Sudanese communities became more divided than ever before in their history. These organic divides among the Southern Sudanese communities were exacerbated by the deliberate &quot;divide and rule&quot; policies instituted by the regimes in Khartoum, in order to maintain their power over the Southern Sudanese peoples. SPLA-Nasir accused Garang of ruling by force, in a &quot;dictatorial reign of terror&quot;; but ethnic rivalry seemed to have a part, with the Nasir faction mainly composed of Nuer, and Garang&#x27;s supporters mainly Dinka people. Months of fighting between the two factions left thousands dead in early 1992. The SPLA-Nasir also raised the idea of an independent south (whereas Garang wanted unity).

On September 14, 1992, Bany, who was at the time Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the SPLA and Deputy Chairman of the SPLM, announced his defection from the SPLA, and escaped Garang territory. The following day, Commander Salva Kiir Mayardit was promoted from Chief of Staff to Bany&#x27;s old positions of Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Chairman. Bany joined forces with Machar and Akol, and later joined forces with Bol to form SPLA-United, Sudanese People&#x27;s Liberation Army-United.

Garang had refused to participate in the 1985 interim government or the 1986 elections, remaining a rebel leader. However, the SPLA and government signed a peace agreement on January 9, 2005, in Nairobi, in Kenya. On July 9, 2005, he was sworn in as the First-Vice-President – the second most powerful person in the country – following a ceremony in which he and President Omar al-Bashir signed a power-sharing constitution. Simultaneously, he became the premier in southern Sudan. This administration had limited autonomy for six years, at the end of which there would be a scheduled referendum regarding secession. No Christian or southerner had ever held such a high government post. Commenting after this ceremony, Garang stated, &quot;I congratulate the Sudanese people, this is not my peace or the peace of al-Bashir, it is the peace of the Sudanese people.&quot;

In the Hillcrest Hotel in Nairobi on New Year&#x27;s Day 2003, there was a meeting between the SPLA and the Fur people. Garang asked two associates of Abdul Wahid al Nur (who later formed the Sudan Liberation Movement) to declare that the Fur people were with the SPLA – they refused.

Over 15 months, starting in September 2003, Ali Osman and Garang met in private in Naivasha. Their secret meetings and negotiations lasted up until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was initialed on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2004.

The CPA appeared to embody the vision of the &quot;New Sudan&quot; that Garang wanted. Within the CPA, power was split between the National Congress Party and the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement for six years, until 2010, with Garang as the first vice-president.

As a leader, John Garang&#x27;s democratic credentials were often questioned. For example, according to Gill Lusk, &quot;John Garang did not tolerate dissent and anyone who disagreed with him was either imprisoned or killed&quot;. Under his leadership, the SPLA was accused of human rights abuses.

The ideological profile of SPLA was as shadowy as Garang himself.
He varied from Marxism to drawing support from Christian fundamentalists in the US.

The United States State Department argued that Garang&#x27;s presence in the government would have helped solve the Darfur conflict in western Sudan, but others consider these claims &quot;excessively optimistic&quot;. U.S. President George W. Bush, who supported South Sudanese independence, especially considered Garang to be a promising leader and called him a &quot;partner in peace.&quot; Bush highlighted Garang&#x27;s Christian faith, and even connected him to support at evangelical churches in his hometown of Midland, Texas.

Garang effectively used radio to advance his cause.

==Death==
In late July 2005, Garang died after the Ugandan presidential Mi-172 helicopter he was flying in crashed. He had been returning from a meeting in Rwakitura with long-time ally President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. He did not tell the Sudanese government that he was going to this meeting and therefore, did not take the presidential plane. In fact, Garang had said he was going to spend the weekend in New Cush, a small village near the Kenyan borders founded by Garang himself. To this day, neither the identity of any other participants at the meeting nor its purpose is known.

After the helicopter had been missing for more than 24 hours, the Ugandan president notified the Sudanese government, which in turn contacted the SPLM for information. The SPLM responded that the helicopter Garang was taking had landed safely at an old SPLA training camp. The Sudanese state television duly reported this. A few hours later, Abdel Basset Sabdarat, Sudan&#x27;s Information Minister, then appeared on TV to refute the earlier report that Garang&#x27;s helicopter landed safely. It was Yasir Arman, the SPLA/M spokesperson, who had told the government that Garang&#x27;s plane had landed safely and his intention, in doing so, was to buy time for internal succession arrangements within the SPLA, before Garang&#x27;s death was to be declared. Garang&#x27;s helicopter crashed on Friday and he remained &#x27;missing&#x27; throughout Saturday. During this time, the government believed he was still resolving his affairs in Southern Sudan. Finally, a statement released by the office of the Sudanese President, Omar el-Bashir, confirmed that the Ugandan presidential helicopter had crashed into &quot;a mountain range in southern Sudan because of poor visibility and this resulted in the death of Dr. John Garang DeMabior, six of his colleagues and seven Ugandan crew members.&quot;
According to the Sudan Tribune John Garang&#x27;s legacy was a major cornerstone in South Sudan&#x27;s fight for independence. Without Garang, many marginalized people of Africa, including that of Sudan would still be largely forgotten about in the modern world.
His body was flown to New Cush, a southern Sudanese settlement near the scene of the crash, where former rebel fighters and civilian supporters gathered to pay their respects to Garang. Garang&#x27;s funeral took place on August 3 in Juba. His widow, Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior, promised to continue his work stating: &quot;In our culture we say &quot;if you kill the lion, you see what the lioness will do&quot;.&quot;

===Rumors===
Both the Sudanese government and the head of the SPLA blamed the weather for the accident. There are, however, doubts as to whether this was the true cause, especially among the rank and file of the SPLA. Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President, stated that the possibility of &quot;external factors&quot; having played a role could not be eliminated.

The SPLM/SPLA Rumbek crisis, which took place in Rumbek from November 29 to December 1, 2004; one month before the signing of the CPA is also believed to have been a factor relevant to John Garang&#x27;s death.

While the Sudanese people followed the Naivasha peace talks closely, with high hopes of freedom and democratic transformation, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) was rife with rumors and accusations of conspiracy relating to the removal of SPLM deputy Chairman, Salva Kiir Mayardit, and his replacement with the young Nhial Deng Nhial. Nhial Deng Nhial was the son of the famous leader of the southern Sudanese, William Deng Nhial, who had been assassinated by the Sudanese army in 1968. William Deng Nhial had led the Sudan African National Union (SANU) in exile, but had returned to Sudan to take part in the 1968 elections, shortly before he was killed. It has been reported that Salva Kiir disagreed with the amnesty afforded to Riek Machar and Lam Akol after their coup attempt against Garang in 2003; he also disliked Garang&#x27;s decision to give Machar a leadership position as his deputy. It is rumored that in response to these actions by Garang, Kiir threatened to lead an armed revolt against South Sudan&#x27;s leadership.

<doc id="1140171" wikidata="Q548848" url="?curid=1140171" title="Mark Gastineau">
<text>Marcus Dell Gastineau (born November 20, 1956) is an American former professional football defensive end who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons with the New York Jets. During his NFL career, he was named Defensive Player of the Year in 1982 and was the first player to lead the league in sacks in consecutive seasons. Gastineau also received five Pro Bowl and four first-team All-Pro selections. At the time of his retirement, he held the single-season sack record. For his accomplishments in New York, Gastineau was inducted to the Jets Ring of Honor in 2012.

==College career==
He entered Eastern Arizona Junior College in 1975 and earned All-America honors in his first season. He transferred to Arizona State University, and spent just one season playing defensive end there before finally settling upon East Central Oklahoma State University, now East Central University, in Ada, Oklahoma. He had 27 quarterback sacks in his college career, and earned Outstanding Defensive Lineman honors for the North in the 1979 Senior Bowl.

Gastineau became ECU&#x27;s first-ever draft pick when the New York Jets selected him in the second round of the 1979 NFL draft. Connie Carberg, the first female NFL scout in history, was credited with helping the Jets discover Gastineau. The team was coaching in the Senior Bowl and needed another defensive lineman on the roster due to a vacancy, so Carberg called several prospects before suggesting Gastineau to be the replacement based on a phone conversation with him. He was projected to be an eighth round draft pick at the time, but due to his performance in the Senior Bowl and other pre-draft processes, the Jets selected him in the second round.

==Professional career==
Gastineau was among the most talented and honored defensive linemen of his era. He made the Pro Bowl five straight seasons (1981–1985) and finished his ten-year career with 74 officially recorded sacks (sacks were not an official stat for the first three years of his career). He was a First-team All-Pro in 1982–1984 and was consensus All-AFC in each of those years.

===The &quot;New York Sack Exchange&quot;===
In New York, Gastineau was a key part of the famed &quot;New York Sack Exchange&quot;, the Jets defensive line that also included Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and Abdul Salaam. The four combined for 66 sacks in 1981, including 20 by Gastineau (in 1981 sacks were unofficial, but Gastineau&#x27;s 20 sacks trailed Klecko by only half a sack), to lead the Jets to their first playoff game since 1969. He was second-team All-Pro in 1981 as well as being consensus All-AFC. In November 1981, he, Klecko, Lyons, and Salaam were invited to ring the ceremonial opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, which served as the inspiration for their nickname.

With Klecko rupturing the patella tendon in his right knee in the second game of the strike shortened 1982 season against the New England Patriots, Gastineau became the new unofficial leader of the &quot;Sack Exchange&quot;. Though he was often double-teamed, he finished the season with six sacks, and was voted the NFL Defensive Player of the Year by NEA (and awarded the George Halas Trophy). The Jets made the playoffs again in 1982, losing the AFC Championship game to the Miami Dolphins.

===Defensive Player of the Year===
The 1983 season started with Gastineau and the Jets&#x27; first round pick of the 1983 NFL draft, quarterback Ken O&#x27;Brien, being arrested and charged with assault at Studio 54. Despite this off-the-field indiscretion, Gastineau totaled 19 sacks to lead the NFL for the first time.

Gastineau was nationally famous for doing his signature &quot;Sack Dance&quot; after sacking an opposing quarterback. However, he had to stop when the NFL declared it &quot;unsportsmanlike taunting&quot; in March 1984 and began fining players for it. The ban on the dance stemmed from a bench-clearing brawl in the third quarter of a 27–24 overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams at Shea Stadium on September 25, 1983, which began with a sack of Vince Ferragamo by Gastineau who was then shoved from behind by Jackie Slater, the right tackle he had beaten on the play. One month later on October 21, a total of $15,750 in fines was assessed by the NFL against 16 Jets ($7,300) and 21 Rams ($8,450), with Gastineau incurring a $1,000 penalty.

Gastineau had his best individual season with an NFL record 22 sacks (leading the NFL for the second year in a row), 69 tackles and one fumble recovery for a touchdown in 1984. He was voted the UPI AFC Defensive Player of the Year, and was also named MVP of that season&#x27;s Pro Bowl after tallying four sacks and a safety in that game. Gastineau&#x27;s sack record stood for 17 years until Michael Strahan broke it in 2001.

New defensive coordinator Bud Carson installed a 3-4 defense for the 1985 season. Gastineau shifted from left defensive end to right defensive end, although he did move him around to allow for mismatches. Gastineau broke his hand early in that season but still finished second in the league with 13½ sacks and was voted All-Pro by the NEA.

The Jets finished 11–5 in 1985 to earn a wildcard spot in the playoffs along with fellow AFC East rivals, the New England Patriots. Gastineau recorded a sack in the Jets&#x27; 26–14 loss to the Pats at the Meadowlands.

===1986 playoffs===
For the start of the 1986 season, Gastineau was featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; alongside New York Giants star linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Injuries limited Gastineau to just two sacks in ten games (his lowest total since his rookie season) as he was slowed by groin and abdominal muscle ailments and then by a damaged left knee that required arthroscopic surgery and forced him to miss the last five games of the regular season.

Gastineau rebounded in the postseason, however, recording a sack in the Jets 35–15 wildcard round victory over the Kansas City Chiefs and more in the divisional-round playoff game against the Cleveland Browns. Late in the fourth quarter of that game, though, with the Jets leading 20–10 and the Browns facing a second down and 24 from their own 18-yard line, Gastineau was called for a roughing the passer penalty.

The play had originally resulted in an incomplete pass by Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar so instead of having a 3rd-and-24 situation, the 15-yard penalty on Gastineau gave the Browns a first down at their own 33. From there, the Browns drove the remaining 67 yards to a touchdown which cut the Jets&#x27; lead to 20–17. The Browns would later tie the game with 7 seconds remaining in regulation on a 22-yard field goal by Mark Moseley and win it on a 27-yard field goal by Moseley 2 minutes and 2 seconds into the second overtime period.

After the game, Gastineau said that he hadn&#x27;t been guilty of roughing and that he was &quot;just following through.&quot; Teammate Marty Lyons, the Jets&#x27; other starting defensive end, defended Gastineau saying, &quot;(Ben Dreith) is a referee who&#x27;s known to take care of the quarterback.&quot; Joe Walton, the Jets&#x27; head coach would say only, &quot;It was a very key play, Mark was just trying to do the best he could do.&quot;

===1987 NFL Players&#x27; strike===
In 1987, Gastineau was the only Jet regular to immediately cross the picket line in that year&#x27;s players&#x27; strike, citing his need to pay alimony. Teammate Dave Jennings said of this understandably unpopular move: &quot;We expected it from Mark. He&#x27;s always put himself in front of the team.&quot; The crossing brought to a head longstanding tensions between Gastineau and his teammates; he had never been popular in the locker room. Gastineau got into a fight with backup center Guy Bingham when he drove into the Jets complex early in the strike. Gastineau was later joined in crossing the picket line by teammates Marty Lyons and Joe Klecko, further undermining the players&#x27; strike.

===Retirement===

Gastineau led the AFC in sacks seven weeks into the 1988 season. He then abruptly announced his retirement soon after Brigitte Nielsen, to whom he had previously announced his engagement, claimed to be suffering from cancer of the uterus. The announcement was followed by a surge of investigation by local New York papers of whether she was telling the truth, reflecting citywide mistrust of Gastineau. At the time of his retirement, Gastineau was the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in sacks.

Gastineau attempted a comeback with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in 1990, but was released after only four games.

Gastineau was inducted into the New York Jets Ring of Honor on October 8, 2012.

In 2022, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Gastineau to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2022.

==NFL career statistics==

* Sacks were not an official stat until 1982

==Boxing==
In 1991, Gastineau began a career in boxing, lasting five years. In his first fight, Gastineau knocked out Derrick Dukes in the first round. Dukes, a professional wrestler, later admitted he took a dive. TV newsmagazine show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interviewed several others that fought Gastineau and were told to take dives to make Gastineau look good. His career ended in 1996 when he lost to another former football player, Alonzo Highsmith. In 18 career bouts, his record in boxing was 15 wins, two losses, and one no-contest.

==Personal life==
Gastineau has been married three times. His first wife, Lisa Gastineau and their daughter Brittny Gastineau starred in the E! reality television show, &quot;The Gastineau Girls&quot;. Gastineau has a son with actress Brigitte Nielsen, Killian Marcus. He was estranged from both children in 2010.

Shortly after his release from prison in 2001, Gastineau claimed he had put his turbulent past behind him after he had a religious conversion to faith in Jesus Christ. Gastineau has appeared on programs such as &quot;The 700 Club&quot; to speak of his experience. Gastineau is a member of the choir at Times Square Church, where he married third wife JoAnn in 2007.

===Legal issues===
In 1984, Gastineau was found guilty of assaulting a patron at Studio 54. He was sentenced to 90 hours of community service, teaching football to inmates at Rikers Island.

In 1991, Gastineau was arrested for picking up a package of amphetamine pills at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. He was sentenced to three years probation in 1993.

In September 2000, Gastineau was sentenced to 18 months in jail after failing to complete an anger management course after hitting his second wife Patricia.

===Health===
In 2016, Gastineau was diagnosed with dementia, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Gastineau said he believed the illnesses could be traced back to football, stating he wanted to continue to teach younger football players how to play the game safely. He blames the brain diseases on poor tackling technique.

In March 2019, Gastineau revealed that he had been battling colon cancer.

<text>The Suffolk Resolves was a declaration made on September 9, 1774, by the leaders of Suffolk County, Massachusetts. The declaration rejected the Massachusetts Government Act and resulted in a boycott of imported goods from Britain unless the Intolerable Acts were repealed. The Resolves were recognized by statesman Edmund Burke as a major development in colonial animosity leading to adoption of the United States Declaration of Independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776, and he urged British conciliation with the American colonies, to little effect. The First Continental Congress endorsed the Resolves on September 17, 1774, and passed the similarly themed Continental Association on October 20, 1774.

==History==
On August 26–27, 1774 the Committees of Correspondence from Suffolk, Middlesex, Essex, and Worcester counties met at Faneuil Hall in Boston to oppose the recent Massachusetts Government Act, which had disenfranchised citizens of Massachusetts by revoking key provisions of the provincial Charter of 1691. The convention urged all Massachusetts counties to close their courts, rather than to submit to the oppressive measure. Berkshire had already done so, and by the first week of October, seven of the nine contiguous mainland counties in Massachusetts had followed suit.

As each county in turn closed its court, it issued a set of resolves to explain its actions. Although the resolves were all similar in tone and scope, the one written by patriots in Suffolk has received more attention for two reasons: it was better crafted, and it was formally endorsed by the Continental Congress. Suffolk, which contained Boston, was the only county in which courts remained nominally open, under the protection of all British troops.

At the Suffolk County Convention of the Committees of Correspondence on September 6, 1774, Joseph Warren introduced the first draft of the Suffolk Resolves, which were edited and approved three days later at the Daniel Vose House in Milton, Massachusetts, which was then part of Suffolk County but is now in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. The convention that adopted them had first met at the Woodward Tavern in Dedham, which is now the site of the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds. As with the other counties&#x27; resolves, the Suffolk document denounced the Intolerable Acts, or Coercive Acts, which had recently been passed by the British Parliament and specifically resolved the following:

# boycott British imports, curtail exports, and refuse to use British products;
# pay &quot;no obedience&quot; to the Massachusetts Government Act or the Boston Port Bill;
# demand resignations from those appointed to positions under the Massachusetts Government Act;
# refuse payment of taxes until the Massachusetts Government Act was repealed;
# support a colonial government in Massachusetts free of royal authority until the Intolerable Acts were repealed;
# urge the colonies to raise militia of their own people.

Following the issuance of the Resolves, Paul Revere delivered a copy to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where it was endorsed on September 17 as a show of colonial solidarity. In response, John Adams commented in his diary: &quot;This was one of the happiest days of my life. In Congress we had generous, noble sentiments, and manly eloquence. This day convinced me that America will support Massachusetts or perish with her.&quot;

Endorsement of the Suffolk Resolves and, with it the rebellion that had enveloped Massachusetts, altered the political balance in Congress and paved the way for other radical measures, such as the Continental Association, a general nonimportation agreement adopted by the First Continental Association a month later, on October 20. Previously, nonimportation agreements had been limited to specific localities, but this one applied throughout the rebellious colonies. The Committees of Safety (or Correspondence), which were formed to enforce the Continental Association, established a revolutionary infrastructure, similar to that of the Sons of Liberty during the early days of the resistance.

A number of counties in other colonies adopted declarations of grievances against Britain before the Declaration of Independence, including the Mecklenburg Resolves and the Tryon Resolves in 1775 and at least 90 other documents favoring independence in the spring of 1776, but the resolves from the Massachusetts County Conventions in August–October 1774 were the first to promote across-the-board noncompliance with British governmental authority.

==Commemoration==
A historic plaque on Adams Street in the Lower Mills area of Milton commemorates the original site of the Daniel Vose House, where the Suffolk Resolves were signed on September 4, 1774. In order to prevent its demolition, the house was moved in 1950 from Lower Mills to 1370 Canton Avenue in Milton. Now known as the Suffolk Resolves House, it was restored to its original colonial appearance and is the headquarters of the Milton Historical Society. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and is open to public view.

<text>Greening Australia is an Australian environmental organisation, founded in 1982, the International Year of the Tree, to protect, restore and conserve Australia&#x27;s native vegetation. Greening Australia was formed by the United Nations Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia.

In the 1980s tree cover decline was acknowledged as having a serious adverse impact on agricultural and pastoral productivity. Removal of tree cover was also linked with the development of salinity, soil degradation and erosion, and declining water quality. On World Environment Day in 1982, then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser announced the establishment of the National Tree Program, which aimed to reverse tree decline throughout Australia. Greening Australia provided the non-government arm of the National Tree Program. With representation in every state and territory and a national office in Canberra, Greening Australia became the primary focus for non-government tree projects.
Since its inception, Greening Australia has undergone a natural evolution – from a focus on trees to a focus on landscape. The Gondwana Link and River Recovery projects reflect this change and the need to address the impacts of climate change.

Greening Australia has been involved in many large scale revegetation and restoration projects in Australia since its inception, including the National Tree Program, the One Billion Trees Project, Bushcare Support, National Corrdiors of Green, Florabank and Green Corps. The focus of its work lies in providing trees and tree planting services, technical advice and education, volunteer co-ordination and funding for restoration projects.

On World Environment Day 1998, Greening Australia&#x27;s work was recognised with admission to the United Nations Environment Programme Global 500 Roll of Honour. This award recognises outstanding achievements in protection of the environment, and represents a significant achievement for Australia&#x27;s role in world conservation.

==Current projects==
Greening Australia&#x27;s mission is to conserve and restore landscapes at scale through collaborative, science-based and innovative conservation programs. The organisation has set bold 2030 goals to align their five national programs with global restoration targets. These goals include:
* 500,000,000 native plants established
* 330,000 hectares of habitat restored
* 1,300,000 tonnes of carbon sequestered per annum

Great Southern Landscapes

Since European settlement, agricultural landscapes in southern Australia have lost over 80% of their natural habitat, impacting on threatened species and the productivity of Australia&#x27;s farmlands.

To help threatened plants and wildlife, and combat global climate change, Greening Australia are working across southern Australia&#x27;s unique landscapes, integrating large-scale re-afforestation and carbon sinks into farming systems to create healthy, productive landscapes for people and nature.

Gondwana Link is one of the largest and most ambitious conservation projects in Australia&#x27;s history. Designed to protect and restore land across and adjoining the nation&#x27;s only global renowned biodiversity hotspot, the completed link will be an arc of bushland stretching for 1000 kilometres, from the wet forests in Western Australia&#x27;s far southwest to the edge of the Nullarbor Plain. Greening Australia is working alongside a host of partners on this project, including Bush Heritage Australia and The Nature Conservancy.

The Living Flinders program covers 1.3 million hectares of internationally significant landscape in the Southern Flinders Ranges in South Australia. It is a national hotspot for native plants and animals including the endangered Yellow-Footed Rock-wallaby and supports critically endangered Peppermint Box and Grey Box Grassy Woodlands. The project aims to increase conservation efforts on privately held land as well as reduce invasion by feral species and reconnect existing reserve systems. It is a ten-year project that calls for a $30m investment. Living Flinders is also part of the SA Government&#x27;s Naturelinks program as well as an important component of the Trans Australia Eco-link.

Reef Aid

Climate change and poor water quality are the greatest threats to the future of the Great Barrier Reef. Greening Australia is addressing both through
its Great Southern Landscapes and Reef Aid programs. Reef Aid works with landholders, communities and traditional owners to improve water quality
for the Reef by rebuilding gullies and restoring coastal wetlands across the catchment.

Nature in Cities

As climate change and population growth intensify pressures on our urban areas, Greening Australia are working with communities, businesses and governments across Australia to create greener, more liveable cities and urban areas where both people and nature thrive. The program aims to bring nature back to our cities and urban fringes by restoring natural ecosystems and urban tree canopy cover for wildlife; improving water quality in our rivers and wetlands; building green corridors to help meet carbon neutral targets and creating open spaces for recreation.

Tasmania Island Ark

Tasmania is Australia&#x27;s last refuge for some of Australia&#x27;s most critically endangered animals – species that are now virtually extinct on the mainland including the Tasmanian Devil, Eastern Bettong, Eastern Quoll and Eastern Barred Bandicoot.

Together with landholders, Tasmania Island Ark is working to recreate 15,000 ha of habitat across the Tasmanian midlands to create a stronghold for endangered wildlife and reconnect people and nature, while revitalising local farming communities.

Thriving on country

Traditional knowledge plays an essential role in conservation and in managing country. Thriving on Country is Greening Australia&#x27;s organisation-wide commitment to a stronger, reconciled Australia. The organisation partners with Indigenous communities across Australia to bring together traditional and contemporary knowledge, exchange skills, increase employment opportunities and support people to live and work on country.

==Past projects==
Saltshaker

The Saltshaker Project was an initiative of Greening Australia, SE NSW, the Boorowa Regional Catchment Committee, and Boorowa Council, in association with the Boorowa Landcare Network, to tackle dryland salinity, reduced water quality, and biodiversity in Boorowa, New South Wales. It was funded by the Natural Heritage Trust, and involved nearly 70 landowners.

==Bushfire crisis==
On 13 January 2020, the Australian Government announced an initial $50m investment in an emergency response to the devastating Australian bushfires for wildlife and habitat recovery. $5 million of this initial investment will see Greening Australia lead the development of a strategic program to build and secure native seed and plant supply for landscape restoration, recovery and resilience in bushfire impacted areas and other vulnerable landscapes.

== Publications ==
Greening Australia has published numerous books on native Australian vegetation, including several authored by South Australian ethnobotanist, Neville Bonney.

==History==
Texas has had at least four congressional districts since the State&#x27;s senators and representatives were re-seated in Congress after the Civil War. The district&#x27;s current configuration is dated from 1903. It has traditionally given its congressmen very long tenures in Washington; only six men have represented it since then.

Once a reliably Democratic district, the district swung rapidly into the Republican column at the federal level as Dallas&#x27; suburbs spilled into the western portion of the district. In fact, it has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964. However, as late as 1996, Bill Clinton carried ten of the sixteen counties that are currently in this district; many of those counties were in the 1st district at the time. Additionally, conservative Democrats continued to hold most of the district&#x27;s local offices well into the 2000s.

For many years, it was based in Tyler, but a controversial 2003 redistricting orchestrated by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay drew it and neighboring Longview out of the 4th district and into neighboring 1st, which made it significantly more Republican. In the process, the 4th district was pushed slightly to the north, picking up Texarkana from the 1st district.

Ralph Hall, the one-time dean of the Texas congressional delegation, represented the district from 1981 to 2015. Originally a Democrat, he became a Republican in 2004. Hall&#x27;s voting record had been very conservative—even by Texas Democratic standards—which served him well as the district abandoned its Democratic roots. By the turn of the century, he was the only elected Democrat above the county level in much of the district. He had been rumored as a party switcher for some time, and many experts believed he would almost certainly be succeeded by a Republican once he retired. 

In 2014, Hall was defeated in the Republican primary by John Ratcliffe, who had served as the former United States Attorney for much of the 4th&#x27;s territory, and was additionally the former mayor of Heath—a city coincidentally located near Hall&#x27;s hometown of Rockwall. No Democrat even filed, though by this time, the district had become so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Underlining just how Republican this district was, the Democrats have only managed as much as 30% of the vote once since Hall&#x27;s party switch.

In January 2015, Ratcliffe took office, and became only the fifth person to hold the seat. He ran unopposed for reelection in 2016, and defeated a nominal Democratic challenger in 2018. 

In May 2020, Ratcliffe resigned his seat ahead of his swearing-in to become the 6th Director of National Intelligence.

The district&#x27;s best-known congressman was Sam Rayburn, the longtime Speaker of the House. 

President Dwight D. Eisenhower was born in the fourth district. 

After the 2012 redistricting process, a large portion of Collin County had been removed, and replaced with the portion of Cass County that had been in Texas&#x27;s 1st congressional district, all of Marion County, and a large portion of Upshur County.

<doc id="1140186" wikidata="Q780259" url="?curid=1140186" title="Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)">
<text>Metrodorus of Lampsacus (, &quot;Mētrodōros Lampsakēnos&quot;; 331/0–278/7 BC) was a Greek philosopher of the Epicurean school. Although one of the four major proponents of Epicureanism, only fragments of his works remain. A Metrodorus bust was found in Velia, slightly different modeled to depict Parmenides.

==Life==

Metrodorus was a native of Lampsacus on the Hellespont. His father&#x27;s name was Athenaeus or Timocrates, his mother&#x27;s Sande. Together with his brother Timocrates of Lampsacus he joined the school Epicurus had set up in their home town. Timocrates, however, soon fell out with both his brother and Epicurus and devoted the rest of his life to spreading malicious slander about them. Metrodorus on the other hand soon became the most distinguished of the disciples of Epicurus, with whom he lived on terms of the closest friendship, and whom he later followed to Athens, never having left him since he became acquainted with him, except for six months on one occasion, when he paid a visit to his home. 

Metrodorus died in 278/7 BC, aged 53, seven years before Epicurus, who would have appointed him his successor had he survived him. He left behind him a son named Epicurus, and a daughter, whom Epicurus, in his will, entrusted to the guardianship of Amynomachus and Timocrates of Potamus, to be brought up under the joint care of themselves and Hermarchus, and provided for out of the property which he left behind him. In a letter also which he wrote upon his death-bed, Epicurus commended the children to the care of Idomeneus, who had married Batis, the sister of Metrodorus. The 20th of each month was kept by the disciples of Epicurus as a festive day in honour of their master and Metrodorus. Leontion is spoken of as the wife or mistress of Metrodorus.

Diogenes Laërtius mentioned Epicurus letter, &quot;All my books to be given to Hermarchus. And if anything should happen to Hermarchus before the children of Metrodorus grow up, Amynomachus and Timocrates shall give from the funds bequeathed by me, so far as possible, enough for their several needs, as long as they are well ordered. And let them provide for the rest according to my arrangements; that everything may be carried out, so far as it lies in their power. Of my slaves I manumit Mys, Nicias, Lycon, and I also give Phaedrium her liberty.&quot;

==Philosophy==

The philosophy of Metrodorus appears to have been of a more sensual kind than that of Epicurus. Perfect happiness, according to Cicero&#x27;s account, he made to consist in having a well-constituted body, and knowing that it would always remain so. He found fault with his brother for not admitting that the belly was the test and measure of every thing that pertained to a happy life. According to Seneca, Epicurus placed Metrodorus among those who require assistance in working their way towards truth.

Diogenes Laërtius lists the following works by Metrodorus: 
* Πρὸς τοὺς ἰατρούς, τρία – &quot;Against the Physicians (3 volumes)&quot;
* Περὶ αἰσθήσεων – &quot;On Sensations&quot;
* Πρὸς Τιμοκράτην – &quot;Against Timocrates&quot;
* Περὶ μεγαλοψυχίας – &quot;On Magnanimity&quot;
* Περὶ τῆς Ἐπικούρου ἀρρωστίας – &quot;On Epicurus&#x27;s Weak Health&quot;
* Πρὸς τοὺς διαλεκτικούς – &quot;Against the Dialecticians&quot;
* Πρὸς τοὺς σοφιστάς, ἐννέα – &quot;Against the Sophists (9 volumes)&quot;
* Περὶ τῆς ἐπὶ σοφίαν πορείας – &quot;On the Way to Wisdom&quot;
* Περὶ τῆς μεταβολῆς – &quot;On Change&quot;
* Περὶ πλούτου – &quot;On Wealth&quot;
* Πρὸς Δημόκριτον – &quot;Against Democritus&quot;
* Περὶ εὐγενείας – &quot;On Noble Birth&quot;

Metrodorus also wrote &quot;Against the Euthyphro&quot;, and &quot;Against the Gorgias&quot; of Plato. Small fragments of his work &quot;On Wealth&quot;, were found among the charred remains at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. Philodemus made use of this work in his own works &quot;On Wealth&quot;, and &quot;On Household Economics.&quot; Philodemus cites Metrodorus as the author of the view that Cynic poverty was to be rejected in favour of a more affluent way of life, although wealth in no way contributes to happiness.

<text>Notes on a Scandal (What Was She Thinking? Notes on a Scandal in the U.S.) is a 2003 novel by Zoë Heller. It is about a female teacher at a London comprehensive school who begins an affair with an underage pupil. Heller said to &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2003 that the real life controversy of American middle-school teacher Mary Kay LeTourneau&#x27;s affair with a student was the inspiration for the novel. A film adaptation was released in 2006, starring Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including nominations for Dench and Blanchett.

==Plot summary==

Art teacher Bathsheba &quot;Sheba&quot; Hart falls in love with a 15-year-old pupil, Steven Connolly, who is from a deprived background and has literacy problems. Although they frequently have sex in risky places, including at school and in the open on Hampstead Heath, the couple successfully conceal their affair from colleagues and family. Sheba tells her coworker Barbara what has happened between her and Connolly, though she claims that he only tried to kiss her and she discouraged his advances. 

Barbara eventually finds out about the affair on Guy Fawkes Night, when she sees Sheba talking to Connolly on Primrose Hill. Barbara feels betrayed that Sheba did not confide in her properly and is angered by Sheba&#x27;s neglect of their friendship. (Barbara is herself a lonely woman whose neediness has driven away more than one potential friend.)

Over time, Connolly&#x27;s interest in the affair wanes as Sheba&#x27;s grows. Sheba still does not break off the affair, having become quite enslaved to the now barely interested Connolly. Her obsession continues even after he abandons her for a girl his own age. 

Brian Bangs, a mathematics teacher, asks Barbara to have Saturday lunch with him one day. He confesses his infatuation with Sheba, leading Barbara to realise that he only asked her out to use her as a means to discover information about Sheba&#x27;s private life. Overcome by jealousy, Barbara alludes to Sheba&#x27;s secret.

The school&#x27;s headmaster is somehow informed about the illicit affair. Sheba is suspended from her job and charged with indecent assault on a pupil. Her husband demands that she leave the family home and prevents her from seeing their children, especially their son Ben, who has Down syndrome. While Sheba&#x27;s life is quickly disintegrating, Barbara thrives on the new situation, which she considers her chance to prove her qualities as a friend. When the headmaster forces her into early retirement, Barbara gives up the lease on her own small flat and moves in with Sheba and her brother.

Sheba discovers Barbara has been writing an account of Sheba&#x27;s relationship with Connolly. She is distraught and furious, not least because Barbara has written about events she did not personally witness, and made judgements about people close to Sheba. She is eventually reconciled with Barbara due to their shared desperation and loneliness. Even now, Barbara uses their desperate circumstances as yet another opportunity to further their relationship, and the mentally weakened Sheba can do little to resist. The novel ends with Sheba, trapped and demoralised, resigning to Barbara&#x27;s dominance of her.

<text>Polyaenus of Lampsacus ( ; , &quot;Polyainos Lampsakēnos&quot;; c. 340 – c. 285 BCE), also spelled Polyenus, was an ancient Greek mathematician and a friend of Epicurus.

==Life==
He was the son of Athenodorus. His friendship with Epicurus started after the latter&#x27;s escape from Mytilene in 307 or 306 BC when he opened a philosophical school at Lampsacus associating himself with other citizens of the town, like Pythocles, Colotes, and Idomeneus. With these fellow citizens he moved to Athens, where they founded a school of philosophy with Epicurus as head, or &quot;hegemon&quot;, while Polyaenus, Hermarchus and Metrodorus were &quot;kathegemones&quot;.

A man of mild and friendly manners, as Philodemus refers, he adopted fully the philosophical system of his friend, and, although he had previously acquired great reputation as a mathematician, he now maintained with Epicurus the worthlessness of geometry. But the statement may be at least doubted, since it is certain Polyaenus wrote a mathematical work called &quot;Puzzles&quot; () in which the validity of geometry is maintained. It was against this treatise that another Epicurean, Demetrius Lacon, wrote &quot;Unsolved questions of Polyaenus&quot; () in the 2nd century BCE. Like Epicurus, a considerable number of spurious works seem to have been assigned to him; one of these was &quot;Against the Orators&quot;, whose authenticity was attacked both by Zeno of Sidon and his pupil Philodemus.

==Writings==
The works attributed to Polyaenus include:
*&quot;On Definitions&quot;
*&quot;On Philosophy&quot;
*&quot;Against Aristo&quot;
*&quot;Puzzles&quot; (&quot;Aporiai&quot;)
*&quot;On the Moon&quot;
*&quot;Against the Orators&quot;
*His collected &quot;Letters&quot;.

<doc id="1140191" wikidata="Q3249777" url="?curid=1140191" title="Bishan, Singapore">
<text>Bishan ( ), also known as Peck San, Bishan New Town or Bishan Town, is a planning area and matured residential town located at the northernmost portion of the Central Region of Singapore. Statistically, the area is ranked the 38th biggest in terms of geographical size and the 22nd most populated planning area in the country. It is located at the most Central point of Singapore, and it comprises Upper Thomson, Marymount, Shunfu, Sin Ming, Bishan North and Bishan East. There are also many private residential properties in Bishan. Bishan is ranked 15th in terms of population density. Apart from its boundary with the Central Water Catchment in the west, Bishan borders three other planning areas: Ang Mo Kio to the north, Toa Payoh to the south, and Serangoon to the east.

What is now Bishan today was once land that belonged to Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng, a century old cemetery that mainly served the Cantonese and Hakka communities in Singapore. Following the establishment of the cemetery in 1870, the first human settlements began to appear in the area, forming what eventually became Kampong San Teng. During the Battle of Singapore in 1942, Peck San Theng was the site of a fierce firefight between the invading Japanese forces and the defending British. The subsequent fall of the island to the Japanese that same year eventually made Peck San Theng a place of refuge for most of the Singapore population. In 1973, Peck San Theng ceased accepting burials, and six years later, following a government lease, the land was acquired for development. Graves were then exhumed between 1982 and 1984, paving the way for the construction of Bishan New Town in 1983. Today, Peck San Theng remains in operation, although it has since been converted into a columbarium.

Bishan New Town became the first in Singapore to depart from the brutalist design seen in most previous Housing and Development Board (HDB) towns. Instead of slab-like residential blocks that were built in uniformed rows, apartment blocks in Bishan varied in height and were often dislocated. Flats within the town also featured pitched roofs which have since become closely associated with the skyline of Bishan. The town is also home to three of Singapore&#x27;s most prestigious educational institutions: Catholic High School, Raffles Girls&#x27; School, and Raffles Institution.

==Etymology==
Bishan derived its name from the Cantonese term for large burial ground, &quot;Peck San Theng&quot; (), which literally translates as &quot;pavilions on the green&quot;. This term reflects the neighbourhood&#x27;s origins as a burial ground that was established in 1870 by Cantonese and Hakka immigrants. This burial ground has since been redeveloped and the original graves were relocated to the nearby Peck San Theng Temple.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
The Bishan planning area, as demarcated by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), is situated in the Central Region of Singapore, bounded by planning areas of Ang Mo Kio to the north, Toa Payoh to the south and Serangoon to the east.

Bishan New Town sits within this planning area.

=== Subdivisions ===
The Bishan planning area is further subdivided into three subzones, which are divided into three roughly vertical areas in the Bishan planning area as follows (from east to west):
== Demographics ==

As of the General Household Survey from SingStat in 2015, Bishan&#x27;s population consisted of 90,700 people, with 85.1% Chinese, 4.1% Malay, 7.7% Indian and 3.0% Others. The population density was 11,564 residents per square kilometre (29,652.1/mi2), ranking as the 15th planning area in Singapore by population density.
Based on the 2023 population trends from SingStat, Bishan had a total of 31,600 households, with 63.5% being Housing and Development Board (HDB) housing, 26.2% being condominiums, and 9.8% being landed properties.

==History==
Peck San Theng cemetery was established in 1870 on the site of present-day Bishan by Cantonese and Hakka immigrants. People began to settle around the cemetery, and Kampong San Theng and Soon Hock Village, which lay within Kampong San Theng grounds, soon grew in size. Singapore Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng, a federation of 16 Cantonese clans in Singapore, managed and ran Kampong San Theng. This settlement grew over time to accommodate nearly 2000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century.

During World War II, the Peck San Theng cemetery became a battle ground between British and Japanese forces. The 2nd Battalion of the Cambridgeshire Regiment had engaged the Japanese forces on 14 February 1942 over the nearby strategically important MacRitchie Reservoir. The Japanese also bombed Kampong San Teng, which resulted in significant civilian casualties. The battle ended the next day, 15 February, when the British surrendered to the Japanese. At that point, British troops were still holding out along Braddell Road. During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, this area became a refuge for people trying to evade the Japanese because the Japanese occupiers were afraid to enter the cemetery.

After the war, the graves of Peck San Theng became a known gangster hideout, and gang-related crimes became rife in the area. In 1973, the government ordered the cemetery to be closed and mandated that no fresh burials were allowed to be done within the cemetery. The government later acquired this cemetery land from the Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng foundation for SGD$$4.95 million in 1979. As compensation, the government gave 3 hectares of the land back to the foundation for the foundation to build a columbarium. The foundation subsequently built a multi-story columbarium complex on this land.

In the early 1970s, the Housing Development Board (HDB) built the first housing estate which was located at Sin Ming Road along with clusters of industrial sectors. The first blocks of residential flats were numbered Block 22–26, now known as Sin Ming Ville. In late 2021, it was announced that Block 26 Sin Ming Industrial Estate will be demolished to make way for redevelopment. 

Sin Ming industrial estate is also known to be a popular destination for matters relating to automotive needs as the estate houses mainly vehicle workshops and establishments specialising in vehicle sales, maintenance, registration as well as inspection. To date, many of the low rise workshops have since been demolished and relocated to the nearby Sin Ming Autocare and Sin Ming Autocity high rise complexes. Plans are underway for the vacated lands to be redeveloped for residential use. 

In addition to Sin Ming Ville, the development of Lakeview Estate was simultaneously completed somewhere in mid 1977. Lakeview Estate was segregated into two segments with fourteen low rise blocks numbered Blocks 1-14 and three high rise flats numbered Blocks 97A, 97B and 97C. The low rise blocks consisted of shophouses and a wet market with food centre located at Block 9 whereas the high rise flats consist of HUDC apartment units. Later in the late 1990s, the low rise segment of Lakeview Estate was demolished and it remains vacant to date. 

By the 1980s, HDB had already begun expanding the area into a satellite housing estate to meet the rising demand for housing from Singapore&#x27;s then-growing population. The residents in Kampong San Teng were resettled and a mass exhumation of the 170,000 graves were carried out in 1980. Redevelopment of the area officially started in 1982. On this land, HDB planned to construct 24,600 residential units distributed across 4 distinct neighbourhoods: Bishan East, Bishan North, Bishan West (subsequently renamed Sin Ming Garden Estate in 1988) and Shunfu Estate, of which Bishan East will be the largest. In 2011, after plans to construct the North–South Corridor (NSC) expressway was announced to ease congestion along Marymount Road and the Central Expressway (CTE), Marymount Terrace was acquired by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and later demolished. In 2018, Shunfu Ville HUDC flats were demolished to make way for the Jadescape Condominium project. 

The first five blocks of housing units were completed by 1985. There were initial fears of a poor demand for houses in Bishan due to prevailing local superstitions about bad fengshui since they were built on a former cemetery. However, the first batch of houses were all snapped up during their launch to buyers who were attracted by the central location of Bishan.

==Sports==
Bishan Sports Centre, formerly known as Bishan Sports and Recreation Centre, houses sporting facilities such as a sports hall, a stadium, a dance studio and a swimming complex. Managed by Sport Singapore, these sporting facilities cater to both the general public and professional athletes.

Several major national and international level sporting events has been held at the Bishan Sports Centre, including the 2009 Asian Youth Games and the 2010 Youth Olympic Games. Bishan Sports Hall, which serves as the primary venue for gymnastics competitions in Singapore, has hosted gymnastic competitions as part of the 2009 Asian Youth Games, 2010 Youth Olympic Games and the 2015 SEA Games. It is also the venue for national-level gymnastics competition in Singapore. Similarly, the 4,200-seat Bishan Stadium has hosted the athletics and football competitions at the 2010 Youth Olympic Games and the 2015 SEA Games respectively.

Bishan Stadium is the home of the Lion City Sailors, a professional football club that plays in Singapore Premier League.

Opened in 2008, the Bishan Active park also offers sporting facilities to the residents of Bishan. This 24,000 square metres park houses facilities such as a roller blading track, basketball courts and a beach volleyball court, augmenting the facilities found at the Bishan Sports Centre.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===

Bishan is connected by road to the rest of Singapore via the Central Expressway (CTE), a major expressway connecting Northern parts of Singapore with its city centre. In addition it has its own Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, the Bishan MRT station, which is an interchange station on both the North–South Line (NSL) and Circle Line (CCL). Bishan also has a bus interchange that provides bus services to other parts of Singapore (such as Changi and Punggol). There are also feeder bus services that operate within the neighbourhood.

The Kallang Park Connector, which begins in Bishan, provides a cycling route between Bishan and the Central Business District along the Kallang River. This route was the first park connector that was constructed in Singapore.

Marymount MRT station is a station on the CCL that serves residents living in Shunfu, Thomson, Sin Ming and Jalan Pemimpin. 

Both Bright Hill station and Upper Thomson station are MRT stations on the Thomson–East Coast Line (TEL) that provide connection between the Sin Ming and Thomson area of Bishan with the northern parts and Central Business District of Singapore. The upcoming Cross Island Line will also have connections with the TEL at Bright Hill station.

=== Commercial areas ===
Bishan currently has 8 commercial areas.

*The Junction 8 Shopping Centre, run by CapitaLand, is situated at Bishan Central near the Bishan MRT station and Bishan Bus Interchange.
*The Bishan North Shopping Mall is a non-air-conditioned commercial complex consisting of a wet market and a wide range of shops that specialise in the sale of day-to-day products. Contrary to its name, it is not a shopping mall.
*Thomson Plaza is a shopping centre located at Upper Thomson Road.
*Thomson V One and Two is a residential and commercial complex that comes with a mall featuring shoebox sized retail units on the ground floor and basement levels. The site used to be a wet market. 
*Thomson Imperial Court and Sin Ming Plaza, are residential complexes with retail outlets on the ground floor and basement levels. Thomson Imperial Court is built on the site of the now demolished Imperial Theatre. 
*Midview City is an industrial and commercial complex located at Sin Ming specialising in a wide range of trades and businesses.
*Jalan Pemimpin Industrial Area is an industrial and commercial area located near to Marymount specialising in a wide range of trades and businesses.

===Parks===
The parks in the area comprise Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Bishan Harmony Park. Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is situated along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, and covers an area of . The Kallang River runs through the middle of the park, and can be crossed via a number of foot bridges and stepping stones. The park also sports ponds and fishing spots.

Located at the junction of Bishan Road and Braddell Road, Bishan Harmony Park serves the surrounding neighbourhoods, and comprises a garden maze, two barbecue pits, a fitness corner and a skate park. Built at a cost of , the park opened in June 2009. 

==Education==
In 1936, the Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng foundation established a village school in the former Kampong San Teng to provide free education to the farming families living in the vicinity. The Kwong Wai Shiu Peck San Theng School () was initially housed on the foundation&#x27;s temple premises. Starting with 60 students, the school gradually expanded to the point where it started an afternoon session to cater to the demand. The school had to stop classes during the Japanese occupation of Singapore but lessons soon resumed in 1945. In 1957, the school shifted into a new school compound situated at the entrance of a cemetery compound near Upper Thomson. The new school compound had 6 classrooms and could cater to 450 students in two school sessions. The Kwong Wai Shiu Peck San Theng School was also integrated into Singapore&#x27;s mainstream education system that year. In 1981, due to changes in Singapore&#x27;s national educational policy, governmental funding to the school was halted and the Kwong Wai Shiu Peck San Theng School soon closed down.

In addition, Shin Min Public School () was located at Sin Ming Road from 1945 to 1986, closing due to low enrollment. The school&#x27;s site is currently occupied by the Amtech Building.

Since its redevelopment in the 1980s, Bishan has become home to several educational institutions. According to the Ministry of Education, there are four primary schools and seven secondary schools that are located within Bishan. Raffles Institution, one of the oldest educational institutions in Singapore, has been located in Bishan since 1990. This campus houses both of the institution&#x27;s secondary and high school sections. Raffles Girls&#x27; School has also relocated to the area. Other notable schools located in Bishan include Ai Tong School, a primary school founded by Chinese pioneers in 1912, and Catholic High School, a Special Assistance Plan school that names Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as one of its alumni.

The prominent schools of Bishan are namely Guangyang Secondary School, Guangyang Primary School, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School.

In addition, at Bishan North, there are Whitley Secondary School of Bishan Street 24, Peirce Secondary School and Bishan Park Secondary School, both of which are located at Sin Ming Walk. Despite bearing the name Peirce Secondary School, the school was actually a subordinate branch of Bishan Park Secondary School when it first started operating off the latter&#x27;s campus in 1994. The Ministry of Education announced Bishan Park Secondary School as one of the schools to be affected by the merger programme. As a result, it was absorbed by Peirce Secondary School in 2018.

The Bishan campus of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) was established in 1994 as part of the government&#x27;s plan to revamp Singapore&#x27;s vocational education system. It provided vocational courses in subjects such as accountancy and business. In 2005, this campus became part of ITE College Central during a major revamp of the ITE system. This campus was subsequently closed in 2012 and relocated to the new ITE College Central mega-campus in Ang Mo Kio. The old facilities of ITE Bishan subsequently became a temporary holding site for schools which are undergoing renovation. It has since been demolished to make way for the new HDB Build-to-order (BTO) project Bishan Ridges.

In addition to mainstream schools, a campus of the Ministry of Education Language Centre (MOELC), where students get to learn additional foreign languages such as French and German, is located in Bishan. The Singapore branches of the Girl Guides Association and the Scouts Association are also headquartered in Bishan.

A new junior college named Eunoia Junior College was later built at the site of former Nature Park Golf Driving Range located at Sin Ming Avenue by late 2019.

Other than schools ranging from primary to tertiary, there are also nurseries and kindergartens scattered across Bishan estate.

== Housing ==

The town is a mixture of three, four and five-room HDB flats. The majority of the flats are four roomed, with a few being three or five. There are some with balconies, and some are penthouse mansionettes. 

Blocks numbered with &quot;1&quot; as the first digit are generally smaller and more connected with the town center. Blocks numbered with 2 as the first digit are more spread out and generally larger in size. They also tend to be the largest flats in the whole estate, with flat sizes ranging from 1650 square feet to 1700 square feet, some of the largest HDB flats in Singapore. Other numbers tend to be smaller and are usually from 1300 square feet to 1500 square feet. Sin Ming Ville (Block 22-26) is excluded from this category.

There are also various condominiums in Bishan including the Sky Habitat, Clover by the Park and Country Grandeur.

As is with Serangoon New Town, it was built in an area with a large extent of pre-existing private housing, resulting in a disjointed town layout. The oldest public housing blocks were located around Upper Thomson as housing for the surrounding industrial estate. When the area was designated as a new town, the main housing area was built in the vicinity of Bishan MRT station, with neighbourhoods built in Bishan North and Shunfu. Newer blocks were also built in Upper Thomson, while the old blocks were refurbished.

==Politics==
The entirety of the Bishan planning area was originally under the jurisdiction of the four-member (previously five-member) Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representative Constituency (GRC), which was first formed during the 1997 Singaporean general election. Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC remained uncontested under the incumbent People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP), until the 2011 Singaporean general election where the incumbent team, led by former Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng, defeated then-Potong Pasir SMC and Singapore People&#x27;s Party (SPP) secretary-general Chiam See Tong. 

Ahead of the 2020 Singaporean general election, incumbent Member of Parliament (MP) Josephine Teo&#x27;s division was carved into the new Marymount Single Member Constituency (SMC) while Teo went on to helm the neighbouring Jalan Besar GRC. Currently, the MPs overseeing the Bishan areas are Chee Hong Tat (overseeing eastern Thomson), Chong Kee Hiong (overseeing most of Thomson, Shun Fu and east Bishan) and Gan Siow Huang (north Bishan, under the Marymount SMC).

<text>Artur Carlos Maurício Pestana dos Santos (born 1941) is a major Angolan writer of fiction. He writes under the name Pepetela.

A Portuguese Angolan, Pepetela was born in Benguela, Portuguese Angola, and fought as a member of the MPLA in the long guerrilla war for Angola&#x27;s independence. Much of his writing deals with Angola&#x27;s political history in the 20th century. , for example, is a novel that portrays the lives of a group of MPLA guerrillas who are involved in the anti-colonial struggle in Cabinda, &quot;Yaka&quot; follows the lives of members of a white settler family in the coastal town of Benguela, and &quot;A Geração da Utopia&quot; reveals the disillusionment of young Angolans during the post-independence period. 

Pepetela has also written about Angola&#x27;s earlier history in &quot;A Gloriosa Família&quot; and &quot;Lueji&quot;, and has expanded into satire with his series of Jaime Bunda novels. His most recent works include &quot;Predadores&quot;, a scathing critique of Angola&#x27;s ruling classes, &quot;O Quase Fim do Mundo&quot;, a post-apocalyptic allegory, and &quot;O Planalto e a Estepe&quot;, a look at Angola&#x27;s history and connections with other former communist nations. Pepetela won the Camões Prize, the world&#x27;s highest honour for Lusophone literature, in 1997. 

&quot;Pepetela&quot; is a Kimbundu word that means &quot;eyelash,&quot; which is a translation of his Portuguese surname, &quot;Pestana&quot;. The author received this nom de guerre during his time as an MPLA combatant.

==Early life==
Pepetela was born in Benguela, Portuguese Angola, to Portuguese Angolan parents. His mother&#x27;s family had been an influential commercial and military family in the Moçâmedes (present-day Namibe) region of Angola, his great grandfather having been a major in the Portuguese Army. His mother&#x27;s family had been in Angola for five generations, whereas his father was born in Angola to Portuguese parents and spent much of his childhood in mainland Portugal. Pepetela had a middle-class upbringing in Benguela, attending a school where students of all races and classes intermingled. He has claimed that being raised in Benguela gave him more opportunities to befriend people of other races, because Benguela was a much more mixed city than many others in Angola were during the colonial era. He also claims that he began to develop a class consciousness during his school days, noticing the differences between his own lifestyle and the lives of friends who lived in a nearby slum area. In an interview with Michel Laban, he claims that his upbringing also influenced his political views. He had an uncle who was a journalist and writer and who exposed him to many important leftist thinkers. His father also had a considerable library that allowed the young Pepetela to learn more about the French Revolution, something that influenced him profoundly.

When he was 14, the young Pepetela moved to Lubango (then Sá da Bandeira), to continue his studies because there was no high school in Benguela at the time. In Lubango, Pepetela claimed that he became more aware of the problems of race in Angola, as Lubango was a much more segregated community than Benguela. In Lubango he was influenced by a leftist priest, Padre Noronha, who taught him about the Cuban Revolution and kept him abreast of current events. Upon finishing his schooling in Lubango, Pepetela travelled to Portugal where he began to study engineering. While at the Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon he befriended other Angolan students who were associated with the Casa dos Estudantes do Império, the student association of Portuguese students from the overseas. After two years of study he decided that engineering would not fulfill his interests, and he tried to enter the History course at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon. However, with the start of the Portuguese Colonial War home in Angola, he was summoned to serve in the Portuguese Armed Forces and decided to flee Portugal.

==Frontline experience, early novels, and plays==

Pepetela first went to Paris and then, in 1963, earned a scholarship to study Sociology in Algiers, where he was approached by Henrique Abranches from the MPLA to help create a Center for Angolan Studies. This Center became the focus of the young Pepetela&#x27;s work for the next decade. Until 1969, Pepetela, Abranches, and other MPLA members worked together to document Angolan culture and society and publicize the MPLA&#x27;s struggle. In 1969, the Center moved from Algiers to Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo. After the move to Brazzaville, Pepetela became more active in the MPLA&#x27;s armed resistance against the Portuguese in the Cabinda region of Angola and on the Eastern Front. This time in the late 1960s and early 1970s served as the inspiration for one of Pepetela&#x27;s most recognized works, the war narrative, &quot;Mayombe&quot;. During this time, Pepetela also wrote his first novel, &quot;Muana Puó&quot;. The novel was written during his time in Algiers and deals with Angolan culture, using the metaphor of traditional masks of the Chokwe people to expose different dichotomies present in Angolan culture. His novel displays the knowledge of indigenous Angolan cultures that Pepetela gained during his time on the Eastern Front of the war for independence. was never intended to be published, a detail Pepetela made clear in an interview with Michel Laban. The author had written the novel as an exercise for himself and several of his close friends to read; nevertheless, the novel was published in 1978, during Pepetela&#x27;s tenure in the Angolan government.

In 1972, Pepetela published his first novel, &quot;As Aventuras de Ngunga&quot;, a work that he intended for a small student audience. In this text, Pepetela explores the growth of Ngunga, a young MPLA guerrilla, using an epic and didactic tone. The novel introduces the reader, through the eyes of Ngunga, to the customs, geography, and psychology of Angola. Pepetela also used this work to create a dialogue between Angolan tradition and his revolutionary ideology, exploring which traditions should be nurtured, and which should be altered. &quot;As aventuras...&quot;is a novel that exemplifies Pepetela&#x27;s early career, exhibiting a deep love for Angola, a desire to explore Angola&#x27;s history and culture, a revolutionary spirit, and a didactic tone. The novel was written and published while Pepetela was fighting the colonial government on the Eastern Front in Angola. By contrast, &quot;Muana Puó&quot; and &quot;Mayombe&quot; were also written while he was serving on the front, but were not published until after Angolan independence.

When Angola gained independence in 1975, Pepetela became the Vice Minister of Education in President Agostinho Neto&#x27;s government. The author was a part of the government for seven years, submitting his resignation in 1982 to dedicate more time to his writing. During his tenure as Vice Minister he published several novels, including &quot;Mayombe&quot;, a novel that had been written when he was an active MPLA combatant in the early 1970s, the publication of which only came about with the explicit support of President Agostinho Neto. During this period, Pepetela diversified his writing, also writing two plays that focused on Angolan history and on revolutionary politics. Pepetela was part of the governing board of the Angolan Writers&#x27; Union throughout this period as well.

Pepetela&#x27;s plays written during his government tenure also reflect the themes in &quot;As Aventuras de Ngunga&quot;. The first of the plays, &quot;A Corda&quot;, was the first full-length dramatic work to be published in post-independence Angola. It is a play that, in the words of Ana Mafalda Leite, is &quot;didactic and more than a little ideological, making it of limited literary interest&quot;. The play is in one act and features two sides playing a game of tug-of-war over Angola. One side includes the Americans and their Angolan clients, while the other side consists of five guerilla fighters of various ethnicities representing the MPLA. The next play that Pepetela wrote, &quot;A Revolta da Casa dos Ídolos&quot;, takes place in the past, drawing parallels between the Kongo kingdom in the 16th century and Angola&#x27;s struggle for independence. Leite writes, &quot;The play remains didactic but it is innovative both in terms of its use of historical material, and especially in the complexities of the actual mise en scène&quot;.

==Exit from the government, work published in the 1980s==

As mentioned above, Pepetela published several novels during his time as a government minister. Of these &quot;Mayombe&quot; is among the best known. The novel is an account of Pepetela&#x27;s time as a guerilla in the MPLA. The novel functions on two levels, one in which the characters&#x27; thoughts about the nature of the struggle for independence are explored, and another that narrates the &quot;action and incidents&quot; experienced by the nationalist fighters. Ana Mafalda Leite considers the novel to be both critical and heroic, both attempting to highlight the ethnic diversity supposedly celebrated by the MPLA and also illustrating the tribal divisions present in Angolan society, which would lead to the eventual civil war that tore the nation apart in the years from independence until 2002. Leite writes that &quot;the theme of war assumes an heroic and epic dimension since it is a conflict which defines the foundation of the &#x27;fatherland&#x27;&quot;.

After leaving the government at the end of 1982, Pepetela began to focus exclusively on his writing, beginning work on his most ambitious novel to date, &quot;Yaka&quot;. &quot;Yaka&quot;, first published in 1984, is a sweeping historical novel that examines the lives of a family of Portuguese settlers who came to Benguela in the 19th century. A clear desire to research his own origins can be seen in Pepetela&#x27;s choice to write &quot;Yaka&quot;. Pepetela himself, as mentioned earlier in this entry, is a descendant of Portuguese settlers in Benguela. Like &quot;Muana Puó&quot;, &quot;Yaka&quot; also incorporates traditional Angolan spiritual objects in its narrative technique. Where the first novel focuses on masks, Yaka uses a traditional wooden statue utilized by the yakas, social organizations dedicated to the prosecution of war, to structure the narrative. Ana Mafalda Leite writes, &quot;&quot;Yaka&quot; symbolises at once the consciousness of traditional values and &#x27;the anticipated spirit of nationality&#x27; of the new country&quot;. &quot;Yaka&quot; won the 1986 Angolan national prize for literature.

Pepetela continued to write throughout the decade, publishing &quot;O cão e os Caluandas&quot;, a novel that looks at the inhabitants of Luanda and the changes that they have undergone since independence, one year after the publication of &quot;Yaka&quot;. The novel is notable for using the story of a German shepherd&#x27;s wanderings through Luanda to structure it, and for containing a variety of narrative voices. In 1989, he published &quot;Lueji&quot;, a work similar to &quot;A Revolta na Casa dos Ídolos&quot; in that it draws parallels between Angolan history and the contemporary situation in the country. The novel juxtaposes the princess Lueji, an important figure in 17th-century Angolan history, with a young ballerina who is dancing the role of Lueji in a contemporary piece. In the words of Ana Mafalda Leite, &quot;The author writes chronologically of the two women, whose lives eventually begin to merge in the novel.&quot; In the novel, Pepetela recreates the history of 17th century Angola. This is a project that he would undertake again with the 16th century in his 1994 novel &quot;A gloriosa família&quot;.

==New literary directions and the Prémio Camões==

In the 1990s, Pepetela&#x27;s writing continued to exhibit interest in Angola&#x27;s history, but also began to examine the political situation in the country with a greater sense of irony and criticism. His first novel of the decade, the 1992 &quot;A geração da utopia&quot;, addresses many of the issues first raised in &quot;Mayombe&quot;, but from the perspective of the post-independence reality of Angola. The Angolan Civil War and intense corruption in the government both led to a questioning of the revolutionary values espoused in the earlier novel. Ana Mafalda Leite describes the novel as &quot;a critical and sceptical book, not to say a book of disillusionment, certainly one far removed from &quot;Mayombe&#x27;s&quot; heroic virtues.&quot; In this novel, Pepetela analyzes his characters psychologically in greater depth than he had done in his earlier works and assumes a very critical stance. The novel, spanning three decades, is divided into four parts, each of which covers an important aspect of Angola&#x27;s 20th century, including Portuguese colonial oppression, the war for independence, the civil war, and the brief respite from the war that occurred in the early 1990s. Pepetela&#x27;s interest in history remained evident in this book, but his criticism of the Angolan establishment was something new that would reappear again and again.

His next novel of the decade, &quot;O Desejo de Kianda&quot;, published in 1995, continues to manifest the disillusionment exhibited in &quot;A Geração da Utopia&quot;. The novel takes more of a magical realist approach than any of Pepetela&#x27;s former works, positing a situation where several of Luanda&#x27;s largest buildings collapse into Kinaxixi square with all the inhabitants left unharmed. The heroine, a character named Carmina Cara de Cu, leaves her career as a government bureaucrat and becomes an arms dealer.
In an essay on the novel comparing the collapse of the buildings that is the focal point of the novel to the attacks of September 11, 2001, Phillip Rothwell writes that the novel &quot;in some ways continues Pepetela&#x27;s profound and damning portrayal of a betrayed utopia&quot;. The next year he published a different sort of novel, &quot;A Gloriosa Família&quot;. This work examines the story of the Van Dúnem family, a prominent Angolan family of Dutch descent. Pepetela spent years researching the story of the Dutch in Angola in order to write the novel. This novel does not display the same cynical and disillusioned tone as his other novels of the decade did, instead being a broad historical narrative that does incorporate a somewhat magical realist tone. While this novel stands quite apart from much of the author&#x27;s other work, the fascination with Angolan history prominent throughout his career probably comes to its truest fruition in this work.

As the situation in Angola in the 1990s grew more and more dangerous, Pepetela began spending more time in Lisbon and Brazil. By this point in his life his writing had brought him renown throughout the Portuguese-speaking world. In 1997 he was awarded the Camões Prize, the world&#x27;s highest honour for Lusophone literature. Pepetela is the first Angolan and the second African author to win this prestigious award.

==Satire and foreign horizons in the new millennium==

Pepetela has continued to be a prolific writer throughout the 2000s. His work has taken a satirical turn with the series of &quot;Jaime Bunda&quot; novels, detective novels that cast a satirical view on life in Luanda in the new decade. Stephen Henighan writes that the character of Jaime Bunda, a bumbling detective with roots in two of Angola&#x27;s most prominent families, represents the changes that the Luanda Creole population has undergone in the view of Pepetela. Rather than representing a revolutionary vanguard that will create a new Angolan identity, the Creoles of Luanda are depicted in the novels as a kleptocratic oligarchy. Jaime Bunda is a parody of James Bond, whose name stems from his oversized backside (&quot;bunda&quot; in Portuguese). The character is obsessed with both James Bond films and American private-eye novels, something that Henighan claims is &quot;ideologically charged&quot; and illustrates elements of Angola&#x27;s underdevelopment. In the first of the novels, &quot;Jaime Bunda, agente secreto&quot;, published in 2001, the protagonist investigates a murder and rape that eventually leads him to a South African counterfeiter named Karl Botha, a reference to former South African prime minister P.W. Botha, who had mandated the South African intervention in Angola in the 1970s and 1980s. The second novel, &quot;Jaime Bunda e a Morte do Americano&quot;, published in 2003, is set in Benguela instead of Luanda, and deals with American influence in Angola, as Jaime Bunda investigates the murder of an American and tries to seduce an American FBI agent. This novel also presents Pepetela&#x27;s critique of U.S. foreign policy, as the heavy-handed behavior of the Angolan police mirrors the ways that Americans dealt with suspected terrorists during the same period. The novels were published by the Portuguese publisher Dom Quixote and were extremely popular in Portugal, having also had some success in other European countries, such as Germany, where Pepetela had been relatively unknown in the past.

Pepetela also published other types of novels during the decade. His first book to be published in the 2000s was &quot;A Montanha da Água Lilás&quot; (2000), a children&#x27;s book that also looks at the roots of social injustice. In 2005, after the success of the &quot;Jaime Bunda&quot; novels, he published &quot;Predadores&quot;, his sharpest critique of the Angolan ruling class yet. The novel takes place in post-independence Angola and follows the story of Vladimiro Caposso, a lowly bureaucrat who becomes a businessman. Igor Cusack describes the protagonist as a &quot;murderous, philandering businessman gangster ... living in a sea of fellow sharks&quot;. Though he began criticizing the nouveau riche class in Angola as far back as &quot;A geração da utopia&quot;, it can be seen through the &quot;Jaime Bunda novels&quot; and &quot;Predadores&quot; that by the 2000s this theme had become a dominant one in Pepetela&#x27;s work.

The final years of the 2000s have seen a continuation of Pepetela&#x27;s prolific career, with novels appearing in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The 2007 novel &quot;O Terrorista de Berkeley, Califórnia&quot; is entirely set in the U.S. and has minimal connection to Angola. The book deals with current attitudes about terrorism and also with aspects of technology present in modern society. As with several of his earlier novels, Pepetela claimed in a recent interview with the Angolan &quot;Diário de Notícias&quot; that this novel was not intended to be published, but rather that he wrote it for himself. His next novel, &quot;O Quase Fim do Mundo&quot; (2008), was also written as a personal exercise. It is a work that begins to touch on the realm of science fiction, portraying the challenges facing people who find that they are the last living beings left on earth. These characters, who have survived a global disaster, congregate on a small piece of land in Africa (that Pepetela stresses is very close to where humanity is thought to have originated) and are challenged with attempting to create some kind of new world. This book continues the trend begun with &quot;O Terrorista de Berkeley...&quot; in that it is not set in Angola, nor does it deal explicitly with the Angolan reality. The last novel of the 2000s, &quot;O Planalto e a Estepe&quot;, while it does deal with Angola, continues to reflect the internationalization of Pepetela&#x27;s themes in the past decade. The book deals with a love affair between a white Angolan and a Mongolian whom he met while studying in Moscow. The novel also returns to some of Pepetela&#x27;s earliest themes of discovering Angolan nature through its descriptions of the protagonist Júlio&#x27;s childhood in Huíla province.

In addition to dedicating himself to his writing, Pepetela also taught. From 1982 until his retirement from teaching in 2008 he was a professor of sociology in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Angola, now known as the University of Agostinho Neto. He was a visiting professor at Rutgers University in 2002 and the University of California Berkeley in 2003 and 2004.

<doc id="1140201" wikidata="Q2004513" url="?curid=1140201" title="1954 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 1954 Atlantic hurricane season was an above-average Atlantic hurricane season in terms of named storms, with 16 forming. Overall, the season resulted in $751.6 million in damage, the most of any season at the time. The season officially began on June 15, and nine days later the first named storm developed. Hurricane Alice developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved inland along the Rio Grande, producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55 people. Activity was slow until late August; only Barbara, a minimal tropical storm, developed in July. In the span of two weeks, hurricanes Carol and Edna followed similar paths before both striking New England as major hurricanes. The latter became the costliest hurricane in Maine&#x27;s history.

In late September, Tropical Storm Gilda killed 29 people after drenching northern Honduras. A tropical depression in early October was captured by a high-altitude photograph on a rocket, thus producing the first large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. The strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Hazel, which killed thousands in Haiti before striking near the North Carolina/South Carolina border in October. It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming extratropical and affecting Ontario. Intense rainfall affected Toronto with severe flooding, leaving significant damage. The season officially ended on November 15, although another hurricane named Alice developed on December 30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles; it lasted until January 6 of the following year. In total, there were 16 tropical storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

== Season summary ==


The hurricane season officially began on June 15, when the United States Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida, began 24‑hour operations. The agency, under the direction of Grady Norton had access to 43 other weather stations across the Atlantic basin. Norton died during the season from a stroke while tracking Hurricane Hazel. Additionally, a group of Hurricane Hunters planes were put on standby for the season, able to be flown out into storms and collect data. During the season, there were eight named storms, as well as an unnamed hurricane and a tropical depression. The season officially ended on November 15, although an unnamed tropical storm formed a day later. In addition, Tropical Storm Alice developed on December 31, the latest a tropical cyclone has developed in the calendar year.

Cumulatively, tropical cyclones left 193 deaths and $756 million in damage, becoming the costliest hurricane season at the time. The season was one of six to have three major hurricanes strike the country, along with 2005 (which had four), 1893, 1909, 1933, and 2004. Two of the major hurricanes – Carol and Edna – struck New England; this occurred despite an average of only 5–10 New England hurricanes per century. Carol struck Connecticut as a hurricane and left widespread heavy damage. Only ten days later, Edna became the costliest hurricane in Maine&#x27;s history. The third major hurricane, Hazel, was the strongest hurricane of the season, attaining winds of . Unusually, no tropical cyclones affected Florida.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 111, which is categorized as being &quot;above normal&quot;. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength.

== Systems ==
=== Tropical Storm One ===
A broad trough developed over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on May 26. A frontal disturbance formed over Florida along the trough, spawning an area of broad cyclonic turning. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, a closed circulation developed within the system, and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed on May 28 about east of Jacksonville, Florida. Ship observations in the region suggested that the depression intensified into a tropical storm by late on May 28. The system was small, and was not discovered to have been a tropical cyclone until a reanalysis of data in 2015. The storm moved to the northeast ahead of an approaching trough, bypassing the Carolinas to the east; rainfall brushed the coast of North Carolina. On May 29, ship observations suggested peak winds of . On the next day, the storm became associated with a warm front, indicating that it became extratropical to the southeast of New England. Continuing to the northeast, the former storm crossed over the southeastern coast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by another nontropical low to the northwest on May 31.
=== Tropical Storm Two ===

A trough formed over southern Florida on June 17. Early the next day, a circulation formed, signaling that a tropical depression also developed over the Everglades. The system moved slowly north-northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at 06:00 UTC on June 20. Shortly thereafter, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, although the structure was broad and asymmetric due to association with a nearby upper-level low, signaling that the system was possibly a subtropical cyclone. Ship reports in the region indicate that the storm continued to intensify. On June 22, the structure became much more symmetrical while passing just off the Outer Banks, bringing winds of to Wilmington, North Carolina. That day, the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of , and is possible that the storm briefly attained hurricane status. The peak winds were estimated at , due to a pressure reading of . The storm accelerated northeastward due to an approaching cold front. On June 24, the storm became extratropical, and shortly thereafter made landfall along southwestern Nova Scotia. The system dissipated the next day over the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.
=== Hurricane Alice (June) ===
On June 24, Tropical Storm Alice developed. It rapidly intensified in the western Gulf of Mexico, giving the citizens of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico little time to prepare. By June 25, Alice intensified to hurricane status, reaching peak winds of that day, before making landfall in northeastern Mexico, just south of the Mexico–United States border. The storm progressed inland along the Rio Grande Valley, dissipating on June 27.

In Mexico, Alice left minor damage, and killed one person due to a fallen power line. Across Texas, Alice dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at near Pandale, with most of the rainfall concentrated around the Pecos River. High precipitation accumulations occurred in areas that had seen little rains in three years. This led to significant flooding along the Pecos River that produced &quot;probably the greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of [that] size in the United States&quot;, as reported by the International Boundary and Water Commission. Ozona, Texas, sustained the most impact, estimated at $2 million in damage. Downstream, the Rio Grande rose to the highest level since 1865, which flooded seven towns on either side of the border; Eagle Pass, Texas, was flooded with of water. Overall there were at least 55 deaths.
=== Tropical Storm Four ===

A dissipating cold front stalled over the southeastern United States from Arkansas to North Carolina on July 9. On the next day, a low pressure area developed along the coast of Georgia. Soon after, the front dissipated, and by 12:00 UTC on July 10, the system developed into a tropical storm. Observations from a coastal lighthouse and a nearby ship indicated that the storm attained peak winds of while moving slowly east-northeastward, just offshore the Carolinas. The storm began weakening on July 13, and dissipated the next day when it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm that was developing to the north.
=== Tropical Storm Barbara ===

On July 27, a tropical depression developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico, about south of Grand Isle, Louisiana. A map of the low pressure areas forming in July 1954 indicated that the system originated near the Mississippi Delta and tracked southward. After forming, the depression tracked northwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Barbara early on July 28. Maximum sustained winds reached , although a tanker offshore named the &quot;Henry M. Dawes&quot; reported wind gusts of . Officials at the United States Weather Bureau posted a storm warning from Cameron to Burrwood, Louisiana, and also advised small craft to remain at port along the entire northern Gulf Coast. Without intensifying further, Barbara made landfall near Vermilion Bay, Louisiana on July 29, dissipating the next day over Texas. The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, including over in New Orleans. The rains caused flooding as well as some damage to the rice crop. However, the Monthly Weather Review yearly summary described the precipitation as &quot;far more beneficial than damaging&quot;. There was no wind damage.
=== Hurricane Carol ===
Carol developed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25. It quickly intensified as it tracked generally to the north, becoming a hurricane on August 27. Moving parallel to the coastline of the southeastern United States, Carol passed just east of Cape Hatteras with winds estimated at . It intensified further as it accelerated, striking eastern Long Island as Category 3 hurricane. Carol made its final landfall on Old Saybrook, Connecticut, late on August 31. Within a few hours, the hurricane became extratropical over New Hampshire, which later dissipated over Quebec.

In North Carolina, hurricane-force winds left minor damage to houses, estimated around $228,000. Rains from Carol alleviated drought conditions in the Washington, D.C. area. On Long Island, the storm surge flooded the Montauk Highway with of water about a mile across. High winds left 275,000 homes without power, and damage totaled $3 million on the island.

The hurricane moved ashore in Connecticut shortly after high tide, producing a storm surge of from New London eastward. The surge in Narragansett Bay reached , which surpassed that of the 1938 New England hurricane, which flooded downtown Providence with of water. In New London, rainfall peaked around . The hurricane produced winds of over in Connecticut and Rhode Island, including a record-high gust of at Block Island. Widespread areas were left without power from eastern Connecticut to southern Massachusetts. Further north in Maine, Hurricane Carol downed hundreds of trees, as well as destroying widespread apple groves and corn fields. It became the costliest natural disaster in the state&#x27;s history, only to be surpassed by Hurricane Edna ten days later. Across New England, the hurricane destroyed about 4,000 homes, 3,500 cars, and 3,000 boats. Damage totaled $460 million, and there were 60 deaths. In neighboring Canada, high rains caused flooding while strong winds downed trees and power lines.
=== Hurricane Dolly ===

A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 31 to the northwest of Puerto Rico. It moved rapidly north-northwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Dolly later that day and into a hurricane early on September 1. Early in the storm&#x27;s duration, the U.S. Weather Bureau noted the potential for Dolly to affect the same areas of New England that Hurricane Carol struck just days prior. However, the hurricane turned to the north away from land. The Hurricane Hunters estimated maximum sustained winds of on September 2 after the storm passed about halfway between the Outer Banks and Bermuda. Dolly turned to the northeast on September 2 and became extratropical later that day to the south of Nova Scotia. It was tracked until September 4, until it was last located to the north of the Azores. There was no reported damage.
=== Hurricane Edna ===
As Dolly became extratropical, the tropical depression that later became Hurricane Edna developed east of the Lesser Antilles on September 2. It moved northwestward, dropping heavy rainfall on Puerto Rico as it passed north of the island. On September 7 Edna became a hurricane, and the next day reached peak winds of . It turned to the north and northeast, bypassing the Outer Banks and skirting Cape Cod. On September 11, Edna struck Massachusetts as a strong Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane later moved ashore near the border between Maine and New Brunswick around the time it became extratropical. The remnants persisted a few more days before dissipating south of Greenland.

Early in its duration, Edna produced high seas and gale-force winds in the Bahamas, but there was no damage there. Hurricane-force winds occurred in the Outer Banks, although damage was minor. As it passed New England, Edna produced a storm surge during a high tide, which caused severe flooding in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod. Wind gusts peaked at on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and the strong winds across the region left widespread power outages. The hurricane dropped additional heavy rainfall to areas affected by Carol, resulting in flooding in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In Long Island and New England, the hurricane left over $42 million in damage and 20 deaths, only 11 days after Carol affected the same area. About a third of the damage occurred in Maine, becoming the costliest hurricane on record in the state. Hurricane-force winds extended into Canada, causing $6 million in damage (1954 CAD), mostly from crop damage. There was one death in Nova Scotia.
=== Tropical Storm Nine ===

A surface trough persisted across the central Atlantic Ocean on September 2. Over the next few days, the system moved slowly northeastward, independent of any frontal systems. On September 6, nearby ships indicated that the a closed circulation had developed, marking the genesis of the system as a tropical depression. Accelerating to the northeast, the storm reached peak winds of on September 7. By the next day, the system became extratropical, and soon after was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm to the north.
=== Tropical Storm Florence ===

A tropical storm formed in the Bay of Campeche on September 11. Given the name Florence, the storm moved generally west-southwestward with a small radius of maximum winds. Hurricane Hunters reported winds of , although winds were initially (before reanalysis confirmed it was a tropical storm) estimated to have reached minimal hurricane force, or . Before the storm moved ashore, officials in Veracruz evacuated residents from low-lying areas, and overall about 90,000 people left their homes. On September 12, Florence moved ashore between Tuxpan, and Nautla, Veracruz and quickly dissipated. The hurricane flooded coastal cities with up to of water, cutting off communications throughout the state. Damage was heaviest around Poza Rica, primarily from the destruction of banana plantations. Monetary damage was estimated around $1.5 million, and there were five reported deaths.
=== Tropical Storm Eleven ===

A low pressure area was present north of the Yucatán Peninsula on September 14. Nearby ship observations indicated that a tropical depression developed the next day in the central Gulf of Mexico, although the system&#x27;s large structure meant it could have been a subtropical cyclone. The system moved slowly westward, bringing winds of to the coast of Louisiana. It is estimated that the storm reached peak winds of on September 16, based on reports from ships and the Hurricane Hunters. On the next day, the system began weakening over water, dissipating on September 18 without moving ashore.
=== Tropical Storm Gilda ===

On September 24, Tropical Storm Gilda developed in the central Caribbean Sea about halfway between Jamaica and Colombia. A small storm, it moved westward throughout its duration. On September 26, Gilda attained peak winds of while nearing northeastern Honduras. The storm paralleled the coastline a short distance offshore, maintaining its intensity before hitting and later weakening over Belize on September 27. It re-emerged in the Gulf of Mexico before making another landfall near Tampico as a tropical depression on September 29, dissipating the next day.

While moving just offshore the coast of Honduras, Gilda dropped intense rainfall, which flooding about of land along the Chamelecón and Ulúa rivers. The waters caused the widespread destruction of banana plantations and houses, leaving about 3,000 people homeless. The United Fruit Company reacted to this destruction by firing 10,000 of its about 100,000 workers within Honduras. Honduras&#x27;s then-President Juan Manuel Gálvez appealed for aid from the United States. In response, U.S. Air Force planes flew food, medicine, rafts, and water purification tablets to the most-affected regions. A total of 29 people were killed in Honduras. When Gilda made its landfall in Belize, it left little property damage and no deaths.
=== Unnamed hurricane ===

A tropical depression formed in the Central Atlantic on September 25. It drifted east-northeastward, eventually becoming a tropical storm on September 29. The storm curved to the west and west-southwest, becoming a hurricane on October 2. It turned to the northeast on October 3, and reached a peak of winds about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores. By that point it began accelerating, and late on October 6 the hurricane became extratropical over the Northeastern Atlantic. Early the next day it was last observed to the south of Iceland. The hurricane was not named due to its presence in the eastern Atlantic and not being a threat to land.
=== Hurricane Hazel ===

Hurricane Hazel was the deadliest and second costliest hurricane of the season. The storm killed as many as 1,000 people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95 fatalities in the U.S., Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81 people, mostly in Toronto.

Hazel formed on October 5 just east of the Windward Islands and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane while crossing the southeastern Caribbean Sea. After making a hard turn northward, it rapidly intensified as it approached Haiti, reaching Category 3 intensity before landfall. In Haiti, Hazel destroyed 40% of the coffee trees and 50% of the cacao crop, affecting the economy for several years to come. It fluctuated in intensity before making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in the Carolinas, which destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact. It affected several more states, including Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, bringing gusts near and causing $308 million in damage.

When Hazel arrived in Ontario, rivers and streams passing through the Greater Toronto Area overflowed their banks, causing severe flooding. As a result, many residential areas located in floodplains, such as the Raymore Drive area, were subsequently converted to parkland. In Canada alone, over C$135 million (2009: $1.1 billion) of damage was incurred. Hazel was particularly destructive in Toronto, as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm&#x27;s unexpected retention of power. Hazel had traveled over land, but while approaching Canada, it had merged with an existing powerful cold front. The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane. To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1 million (2023: $56.2 million) in aid.
=== Tropical Storm Fifteen ===

On November 16, a tropical depression developed about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and the Azores. It moved to the west, intensifying into a tropical storm and reaching peak winds of (however, due to limited data, it is possible that the storm remained a tropical depression). The storm maintained that intensity on November 21 when it began weakening, dissipating later that day.
=== Hurricane Alice (December) ===
The final storm of the season, Alice, developed on December 30 from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. It persisted into the following calendar year, passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2. Alice reached peak winds of before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea.

Alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500 (1955 USD). Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2. It received the name &quot;Alice&quot; in early 1955, though re-analysis of the data supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season. It was one of only two storms to span two calendar years, along with Tropical Storm Zeta (2005) in 2005–06.
=== Other system ===

On October 2, a tropical depression moved westward from the coast of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico. It moved westward without intensifying beyond winds of , moving ashore about north of Brownsville, Texas. The depression weakened as it moved across southern Texas and dropped heavy rainfall. Brownsville recorded over in a 45-minute period, as well as about in six hours. The rainfall rates of about an inch per hour was the heaviest since June 1950. The depression also moved ashore with high waves and tides.

When the system reached the Big Bend region on October 5 it reintensified slightly. Around that time, the United States Navy conducted a rocket test from White Sands, New Mexico; this was despite that such tests were rarely performed when the skies were cloudy. The rocket took an unintended photograph of the depression from an altitude of about , which became the first such large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. The depression later moved into New Mexico and dropped additional rainfall, interacting with an approaching cold front. Flooding was reported around Roswell, as well as along the Pecos River system. Rainfall in the state peaked at in Canton, New Mexico. The system dissipated on October 7.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1954. The list was the same as 1953 with the exception of &quot;Gilda&quot;, which replaced &quot;Gail&quot; due to the latter&#x27;s confusion with the term gale.

=== Retirement ===

The practice of retiring the names of particularly deadly or damaging storms from further use in the North Atlantic basin was begun by the United States Weather Bureau following the 1954 season. The names &quot;Carol&quot;, &quot;Edna&quot;, and &quot;Hazel&quot; were the first to be retired under this policy.

<text>Toss juggling is the form of juggling which is most recognisable as &#x27;juggling&#x27;. Toss juggling can be used as: a performing art, a sport, a form of exercise, as meditation, a recreational pursuit or hobby.

In toss juggling, objects — such as balls, bean bags, rings, clubs, etc. — are thrown or tossed into the air and caught. Toss juggling is a form of object manipulation.

== Juggling techniques and patterns ==
&#x27;Toss juggling&#x27; has a number of basic principles and patterns. Most of the more complex patterns are variations of the basic ones and all toss juggling must conform to these basic principles.

===Basic principles===
Toss juggling is, according to most sources, the throwing and catching of objects, where there are more objects than there are hands (or sometimes other parts of the body) doing the throwing and catching. Three balls thrown and caught between two hands is toss juggling, as there are more balls than hands. Two balls between two hands would not be considered toss juggling, as the number of balls and hands is equal.
===Basic patterns===
There are three basic patterns in toss juggling with many variations, some exceedingly complex, that are based on these basic patterns.

====Shower====

The &quot;shower&quot; is the most commonly depicted pattern in pictures and illustrations of jugglers (although often wildly exaggerated). The objects juggled follow a circular pattern with one hand doing higher throws and the other passing or doing low throws to the first hand. This pattern can be used to juggle an odd number or even number of objects. In siteswap notation, a three object shower would be called 51.

====Cascade====

The &quot;cascade&quot; pattern is often the first pattern taught to beginner jugglers. The objects juggled follow a horizontal figure of eight pattern with each hand throwing the object to the same height when the previous throw has reached it peak. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an odd number of objects. In siteswap notation, a three object cascade would be called 3.

====Fountain====

The &quot;fountain&quot; is where each hand throws and catches objects and they do not transfer to the opposite hand. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an even number of objects. In siteswap notation, a four object fountain would be called 4.

=== Advanced patterns and tricks ===

Besides the cascade (or reverse cascade), other toss patterns include the &quot;box&quot; or &quot;column&quot;, and any number of multiplex patterns or contact juggling tricks within the pattern.

There are also amusing stunts such as the &quot;Yo-yo&quot; and the &quot;Robot&quot;, which give the illusion that the balls are connected to each other or to the juggler&#x27;s body. By adding elementary skills to any juggling pattern the pattern can be increased, incrementally, in complexity.

There are even wildly intricate patterns such as the &quot;Mills Mess, &quot;which is widely attributed to Steve Mills of The Dazzling Mills Family. For a given pattern any number of variants may occur to the juggler, for instance, Mills Mess has at least three well-known variants, produced by adding flourishes such as &quot;chops&quot;, &quot;holds&quot;, &quot;stalls&quot;, and &quot;carries&quot;. &quot;Mills&quot; colloquially refers to any pattern in juggling where the hands cross back and forth over one another. Any pattern valid in siteswap notation can be done &quot;vanilla&quot;, reverse, and in Mills.

=== Other patterns ===
Below is a list of other common three-ball patterns.
* Burke&#x27;s Barrage
* Rubenstein&#x27;s Revenge
* Flash

== Performance ==
Juggling has been used as a performance skill for thousands of years. Toss juggling has been significant in such performances and has continued to be a major part of juggling performances up to the present day. Juggling performances are of two main types: a performance which shows off the technical skill of the juggler and a performance of juggling with comedy. These two main types can be performed as shows, as walkabout entertainment or as stationary freestyle entertainment. All types of performances can be accompanied by music, other circus skills or other performers.

==Passing and feeding==

Passing is the juggling skill of throwing objects between two or more jugglers. The most common passing combination is where two jugglers throw six objects between them and perform various tricks in addition to that basic pattern. The number of objects juggled between two people can be increased with 7, 8 and even nine object passing being a common occurrence. Higher numbers have also been achieved with the current record for club passing being 13 clubs passed (juggled) between the two jugglers.

A variation on passing, called &quot;feeding&quot;, is performed by three or more jugglers. The most common combination is performed by three jugglers: one juggler (the &quot;feeder&quot;) passes alternately to each of the other two jugglers (the &quot;feedees&quot;) while they stand in a &#x27;triangle&#x27;. The tempo of the juggling as well as the way the objects are thrown between the jugglers can be varied. Feeding can be performed with one feeder feeding multiple feedees or a mix of multiple feeders and feedees in one pattern.

Passing and feeding patterns and tricks in toss juggling range from the simple to the very complex. New patterns and tricks are developed and practiced at juggling conventions.

== Sport ==
As a sport, juggling can be done competitively, with the jugglers attempting to improve upon the tricks or performances of other jugglers within a range of disciplines and categories. Competitions are held for both solo and multiple juggling competitors. Jason Garfield popularised this form of juggling in the USA. This style of juggling became more popular after he organised a World Juggling Federation competition in 2004 which has now become an annual event.

== Exercise and fitness ==
As exercise, juggling is a highly aerobic activity, increasing the heart rate and respiration. Juggling helps one to develop good hand-eye coordination, physical fitness and balance.

=== Reflexes ===
Juggling helps to develop quick reflexes, and in fact, jugglers develop &quot;higher-order reflexes&quot;, reflexes not typically associated with normal human activity. These reflexes are formed through repetition of what are, at first, slowly learned and difficult processes. As the various processes develop into reflexive actions, additional, more difficult or complex skills are &#x27;layered&#x27; atop previous, well-developed skills. These new more complex skills eventually become more reflexive, and eventually, various unusual high order reflexes develop. An example is that, while catching a raw chicken&#x27;s egg may be quite challenging to a novice juggler, a more skilled juggler might be able to easily catch — unbroken — an egg thrown towards him without warning.

== Meditation ==
Paradoxically, the same processes that are well known for exercising the body, can also be a very relaxing activity. As meditation, juggling a repeating pattern or patterns can take one&#x27;s mind off the stresses they might encounter in their daily lives. The constant rising and falling of the objects, the regularity of the rhythms, can become almost hypnotic, and the attention of a juggler while tightly focused on the juggling pattern may seem to expand and even to &quot;encompass the universe.&quot;

== Recreation ==
As a recreational pursuit, juggling excels in many ways. Besides the previously mentioned health benefits, any form of juggling is at its best when done socially. The equipment is inexpensive or free — though very costly equipment is also available — and easily portable. Juggling is great for &quot;breaking the ice&quot; at parties and other social gatherings . Jugglers are a friendly sort, usually, and are often very willing to help beginning jugglers with advice. Juggling conventions, clubs and other gatherings where jugglers congregate can be great places to meet and share the art of juggling, for experts novices and even &#x27;non-jugglers&#x27; — who often find themselves doing some form of juggling themselves.

In 1990 it was estimated by the International Jugglers&#x27; Association that twenty-three percent of Americans can juggle a three-ball cascade.

<text>Craig Michael Barrett (born 16 November 1971, in Ōpunake) is a New Zealand athlete specialising in racewalking. He was the dominant racewalker in New Zealand for many years and is the nation&#x27;s record holder for the 3 km, 20 km, 30 km, 50 km and 2-hour disciplines. He attended the Olympic Games in Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000) and Athens (2004). He won a silver medal in the 50 km walk at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.

During the 1998 Commonwealth Games, Barrett collapsed within one kilometre of the finish line whilst leading the 50 km walk, reportedly as a result of dehydration.

<text>The classical complement pathway is one of three pathways which activate the complement system, which is part of the immune system. The classical complement pathway is initiated by antigen-antibody complexes with the antibody isotypes IgG and IgM.

Following activation, a series of proteins are recruited to generate C3 convertase (C4b2b, historically referred C4b2a), which cleaves the C3 protein. The C3b component of the cleaved C3 binds to C3 convertase (C4b2b) to generate C5 convertase (C4b2b3b), which cleaves the C5 protein. The cleaved products attract phagocytes to the site of infection and tags target cells for elimination by phagocytosis. In addition, the C5 convertase initiates the terminal phase of the complement system, leading to the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The membrane attack complex creates a pore on the target cell&#x27;s membrane, inducing cell lysis and death.

The classical complement pathway can also be activated by apoptotic cells, necrotic cells, and acute phase proteins.

==Complement cascade==

The classical pathway is distinct from the other complement pathways in its unique activation triggers and cascade sequence. Activation of the complement pathway through the classical, lectin or alternative complement pathway is followed by a cascade of reactions eventually leading to the membrane attack complex.

===Initiation===
The classical complement pathway can be initiated by the binding of antigen-antibody complexes to the C1q protein. The globular regions of C1q recognize and bind to the Fc region of antibody isotypes IgG or IgM. These globular regions of C1q can also bind to bacterial and viral surface proteins, apoptotic cells, and acute phase proteins. In the absence of these activation factors, C1q is part of the inactive C1 complex which consists of six molecules of C1q, two molecules of C1r, and two molecules of C1s.

=== Formation of C4b convertase ===
The binding of C1q with pathogen surface or antigen-antibody immune complex leads to conformational changes and the activation of the serine protease C1r. The activated C1r then cleaves and activates the serine protease C1s. Activated C1s cleaves C4 into C4a and C4b. 

=== Regulation of C4b ===
The newly formed C4b cannot stay activated as a highly reactive thioester bond is revealed once C4 has been cleaved. The thioester bond is cleaved by water resulting in its cleavage permanently deactivating the C4b molecule. As a result of this C4b is restricted to only bind to pathogen surfaces. They would undergo rapid deactivation in the time it took to travel from the origin of activation where C1q is complexed with an antigen-antibody immune complex(IC) or where C1q is directly attached to the pathogens surface.

=== Formation of C3-convertase. ===
Surface-bound C4b acts as a receptor for the binding of C2. The binding of C2 and C4b results in C2 being cleaved by C1s into C2a and C2b. C2b diffuses into the plasma as a protein inflammatory mediator while C2a remains attached with C4b, forming the C3-convertase (C4b2a). The function of the membrane-bound C3-convertase is the cleavage of many many molecules of C3 into C3a and C3b. C3a is a smaller fragment of C3 is a potent inflammatory mediator. 

=== C3b function and structure. ===
C3b can act as an opsonin. C3b is very similar to C4 in both structure and function also has a thioester bond that forces it to attach to surface nucleophile of the activator(namely the pathogen or IC). Phagocytes have receptors for C3b and as a result of receptor-ligand binding are able to more easily recognize and engulf pathogen molecules. While the anaphylatoxin C3a interacts with its C3a receptor (C3aR) to recruit leukocytes, C3b contributes to further downstream complement activation.

===Formation of C5 convertase and MAC===
C3b binds to the C3 convertase (C4b2a), to form C5 convertase (C4b2a3b). C5 convertase then cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. Like C3a, C5a is also an anaphylatoxin that interacts with its cognate C5a receptor (C5aR) to attract leukocytes. Subsequent interactions between C5b and other terminal components C6, C7, C8, and C9 form the membrane attack complex or the C5b-9 complex which forms pores on the target cell membranes to lysing.

== Clinical significance ==
Because of its role in the innate immune system classical complement has been implicated in a number of pathogen related disorders. Complement is responsible for immune inflammatory response in adipose tissues which has been implicated in the development of obesity. Obesity in turn results in an abnormally high level of complement activation via production of the C1 component of the classical pathway, which can lead to tissue inflammation and eventually insulin resistance, however the exact mechanisms that causes this is yet unknown.

Immunotherapies have been developed to detect and destroy cells infected by the HIV virus via classical complement activation. This process involves creating synthetic peptides that target conserved regions in HIV specific proteins and induce an antibody specific immune response through IgG antibodies. This is important for targeting the virus in its intracellular phase because the antibodies specific to the synthetic peptides can trigger the classical complement pathway and induce the death of HIV infected cells.

Classical complement activation has also been shown to combat Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Certain variants of the IgM antibody were found to bind the Methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; these IgM were found to be critical in complement activation through the classical pathway and subsequent destruction of the bacteria. Therapies that utilize classical complement activation have been shown to be effective in targeting and killing cancer cells and destroying tumors. Tachyplesin, a small peptide, has been shown to exhibit these effects. When injected into target tissue encourages recruitment of C1q and activates downstream events, eventually leading to the formation of the C5b-9 complex which damages tumor cells, killing them.

Lack of regulation of the classical complement pathway through the deficiency in C1-inhibitor results in episodic angioedema. C1-inhibitor defiency can be hereditary or acquired, resulting in hereditary or acquired angioedema. C1-inhibitor plays the role of inactivating C1r and C1s to prevent further downstream classical complement activity. C1-inhibitor controls the processes involved in maintaining vascular permeability. As a result, C1-inhibitor levels of less than 50% of the standard lead to increased vascular permeability, characteristic of angioedema. Cinryze, a human plasma derived C1-esterase inhibitor, has been approved for use in 2008 for the prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks.

Deficiency in the C1q protein of the classical complement pathway can lead to development of systemic lupus erythematosus. Among the many functions of C1q, C1q triggers clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells by activating the classical pathway and binding directly onto phagocytes. Consequently, systemic lupus erythematosus from insufficient amounts of C1q is characterized by the accumulation of autoantibodies and apoptotic cells. Studies are being done to look into antibodies against C1q as a diagnostic marker for systemic lupus erythematosus.
