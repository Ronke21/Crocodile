<text>United States gubernatorial elections were held on November 2, 2004, in 11 states and two territories. There was no net gain in seats for either party, as Democrats picked up an open seat in Montana while defeating incumbent Craig Benson in New Hampshire, while Republicans defeated incumbent Joe Kernan in Indiana and won Missouri after Bob Holden lost in the primary. These elections coincided with the presidential election.

==Delaware==

The 2004 Delaware gubernatorial election was held on November 2, 2004, coinciding with the U.S. presidential election. Incumbent governor Ruth Ann Minner faced a serious challenge from retired Superior Court Judge Bill Lee, but managed a five-point victory on election day. , this was the last time Kent County voted for the Republican candidate in a gubernatorial election or that the statewide margin was within single digits.
==Indiana==

The 2004 Indiana gubernatorial election took place on November 2, 2004, to elect the governor of Indiana.

Incumbent Democratic governor Joe Kernan was defeated by Republican Mitch Daniels. Daniels&#x27; victory was the first time the Republican Party had been elected governor since 1984, and gave the party control of all the important statewide offices. It was also the first time an incumbent governor had been defeated since the Constitution of Indiana was amended in 1972 to permit governors to serve two consecutive terms.
==Missouri==
The 2004 Missouri gubernatorial election was held on November 2, 2004 for the post of Governor of Missouri. The Republican nominee, Missouri Secretary of State Matt Blunt, defeated Democratic State Auditor Claire McCaskill. This gave the Republican Party control of both the governorship and the Missouri General Assembly for the first time in 80 years.

McCaskill had earlier defeated incumbent Governor Bob Holden in the Democratic primary. This was the first time a sitting governor of Missouri had been defeated in a primary and the first time any United States governor had lost in a primary since the 1994 elections.

Coincidentally, McCaskill&#x27;s mother, Betty Anne, had previously been defeated by Blunt&#x27;s grandfather, Leroy Blunt, in a 1978 General Assembly election. Blunt&#x27;s father, Roy Blunt, was a congressman and served with McCaskill in the U.S. Senate from 2011 to 2019.
==Montana==

The 2004 Montana gubernatorial election took place on November 2, 2004 for the post of Governor of Montana. Democrat Brian Schweitzer defeated Montana Secretary of State and Republican nominee Bob Brown with 50.4% of the vote against 46%. Schweitzer formed a ticket with a Republican running mate, choosing state legislator John Bohlinger for the lieutenant governorship.
==New Hampshire==
The 2004 New Hampshire gubernatorial election occurred on November 2, 2004, concurrent with that year&#x27;s presidential election. Democrat John Lynch, a multimillionaire businessman from Hopkinton, narrowly defeated incumbent Republican governor Craig Benson of Rye, winning a two-year term. Benson was the first New Hampshire governor in 80 years to lose reelection after one term. Lynch was sworn in on January 6, 2005.

To date, Benson is the most recent incumbent governor to lose reelection in any New England state.

==North Carolina==
The 2004 North Carolina gubernatorial election was held on November 2, 2004. The general election was between the Democratic incumbent Mike Easley and the Republican nominee Patrick J. Ballantine. Easley won by 56% to 43%, winning his second term as governor. This is the last time a Democrat was elected governor of North Carolina by double digits. 
==North Dakota==
The 2004 North Dakota gubernatorial election took place on 2 November 2004 for the post of Governor of North Dakota. Incumbent Republican governor John Hoeven was easily re-elected defeating Democratic-NPL former state senator Joe Satrom.
==Utah==
The 2004 Utah gubernatorial election took place on November 2, 2004. The incumbent governor was Republican Olene S. Walker, who had become governor following Mike Leavitt&#x27;s resignation to join the George W. Bush administration. However, Walker placed fourth in the Republican primary, far behind Jon Huntsman Jr. Huntsman won the nomination and went on to win the general election, carrying 25 of the 29 counties and winning 57.7% of the overall vote. This was the last time that a Democratic nominee for any statewide office has received forty percent or more of the popular vote, and the most recent election in which a Democratic nominee carried more than three counties in the state.
==Vermont==
The 2004 Vermont gubernatorial election took place November 2, 2004 for the post of Governor of Vermont. Incumbent Republican governor Jim Douglas was re-elected. Douglas defeated Peter Clavelle, the Progressive Mayor of Burlington, who ran as a Democrat.
==Washington==
The 2004 Washington gubernatorial election was held on November 2, 2004. The race gained national attention for its legal twists and extremely close finish, among the closest political races in United States election history. Republican Dino Rossi was declared the winner in the initial automated count and again in a subsequent automated recount, but after a second recount done by hand, Democrat Christine Gregoire took the lead by a margin of 129 votes.

Although Gregoire was sworn in as governor of Washington on January 12, 2005, Rossi did not formally concede and called for a re-vote over concerns about the integrity of the election. The Republican Party filed a lawsuit in Chelan County Superior Court contesting the election, but the trial judge ruled against it, citing lack of evidence of deliberate electoral sabotage. Rossi chose not to appeal to the Washington State Supreme Court, formally conceding the election on June 6, 2005.
==West Virginia==
The 2004 West Virginia gubernatorial election took place on November 2, 2004 for the post of Governor of West Virginia. Democratic Secretary of State of West Virginia Joe Manchin defeated Republican Monty Warner. Manchin won all but three counties. Despite Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry losing the state to George W. Bush by double digits in the concurrent presidential election, Manchin won by nearly 30 points.

<doc id="1130017" wikidata="Q1670965" url="?curid=1130017" title="Toe (automotive)">
<text>In automotive engineering, toe, also known as tracking, is the symmetric angle that each wheel makes with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, as a function of static geometry, and kinematic and compliant effects. This can be contrasted with steer, which is the antisymmetric angle, i.e. both wheels point to the left or right, in parallel (roughly). Negative toe, or toe out, is the front of the wheel pointing away from the centreline of the vehicle. Positive toe, or toe in, is the front of the wheel pointing towards the centreline of the vehicle. Historically, and still commonly in the United States, toe was specified as the linear difference (either inches or millimeters) of the distance between the two front-facing and rear-facing tire centerlines at the outer diameter and axle-height; since the toe angle in that case depends on the tire diameter, the linear dimension toe specification for a particular vehicle is for specified tires.

==Description==
In a rear-wheel drive vehicle, increased front toe-in provides greater straight-line stability at the cost of some sluggishness of turning response. Performance vehicles may run zero front toe or even some toe-out for a better response to steering inputs. Increased front toe-in marginally increases the wear on the tires as the tires are under slight side slip conditions when the steering is set straight ahead. On front-wheel drive vehicles, the situation is more complex. Rear toe-in provides better stability during cornering.

Toe is usually adjustable in production automobiles, even though caster angle and camber angle are often not adjustable. Maintenance of front-end alignment, which used to involve all three adjustments, currently involves only setting the toe; in most cases, even for a car in which caster or camber are adjustable, only the toe will need adjustment. Toe may only be adjustable on the front wheels.

One related concept is that the proper toe for straight-line travel of a vehicle will not be correct while turning, since the inside wheel must travel around a smaller radius than the outside wheel; to compensate for this, the steering linkage typically conforms more or less to Ackermann steering geometry, modified to suit the characteristics of the individual vehicle.

==Road–rail vehicles==
The front rail wheels of road–rail vehicles are often set to toe-in by a distance of 6 mm over 1 metre. Unlike other forms of rolling stock, road-rail vehicles do not always have a common axle between the rail wheels and the toe-in angle prevents the vehicle from hunting when on-rail.

==Interaction with camber==
When a wheel is set up to have some camber angle, the interaction between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.
Toe-in and toe-out give the steering stability.

<doc id="1130020" wikidata="Q1805805" url="?curid=1130020" title="Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)">
<text>In phylogenetics and computational phylogenetics, maximum parsimony is an optimality criterion under which the phylogenetic tree that minimizes the total number of character-state changes (or minimizes the cost of differentially weighted character-state changes). Under the maximum-parsimony criterion, the optimal tree will minimize the amount of homoplasy (i.e., convergent evolution, parallel evolution, and evolutionary reversals). In other words, under this criterion, the shortest possible tree that explains the data is considered best. Some of the basic ideas behind maximum parsimony were presented by James S. Farris in 1970 and Walter M. Fitch in 1971.

Maximum parsimony is an intuitive and simple criterion, and it is popular for this reason. However, although it is easy to &quot;score&quot; a phylogenetic tree (by counting the number of character-state changes), there is no algorithm to quickly &quot;generate&quot; the most-parsimonious tree. Instead, the most-parsimonious tree must be sought in &quot;tree space&quot; (i.e., amongst all possible trees). For a small number of taxa (i.e., fewer than nine) it is possible to do an exhaustive search, in which every possible tree is scored, and the best one is selected. For nine to twenty taxa, it will generally be preferable to use branch-and-bound, which is also guaranteed to return the best tree. For greater numbers of taxa, a heuristic search must be performed.

Because the most-parsimonious tree is always the shortest possible tree, this means that—in comparison to a hypothetical &quot;true&quot; tree that actually describes the unknown evolutionary history of the organisms under study—the &quot;best&quot; tree according to the maximum-parsimony criterion will often underestimate the actual evolutionary change that could have occurred. In addition, maximum parsimony is not statistically consistent. That is, it is not guaranteed to produce the true tree with high probability, given sufficient data. As demonstrated in 1978 by Joe Felsenstein, maximum parsimony can be inconsistent under certain conditions, such as long-branch attraction. Of course, any phylogenetic algorithm could also be statistically inconsistent if the model it employs to estimate the preferred tree does not accurately match the way that evolution occurred in that clade. This is unknowable. Therefore, while statistical consistency is an interesting theoretical property, it lies outside the realm of testability, and is irrelevant to empirical phylogenetic studies.

==Alternate characterization and rationale==
In phylogenetics, parsimony is mostly interpreted as favoring the trees that minimize the amount of evolutionary change required (see for example ). Alternatively, phylogenetic parsimony can be characterized as favoring the trees that maximize explanatory power by minimizing the number of observed similarities that cannot be explained by inheritance and common descent. Minimization of required evolutionary change on the one hand and maximization of observed similarities that can be explained as homology on the other may result in different preferred trees when some observed features are not applicable in some groups that are included in the tree, and the latter can be seen as the more general approach.

While evolution is not an inherently parsimonious process, centuries of scientific experience lend support to the aforementioned principle of parsimony (Occam&#x27;s razor). Namely, the supposition of a simpler, more parsimonious chain of events is preferable to the supposition of a more complicated, less parsimonious chain of events. Hence, parsimony (&quot;sensu lato&quot;) is typically sought in inferring phylogenetic trees, and in scientific explanation generally.

==In detail==
Parsimony is part of a class of character-based tree estimation methods which use a matrix of discrete phylogenetic characters and character states to infer one or more optimal phylogenetic trees for a set of taxa, commonly a set of species or reproductively isolated populations of a single species. These methods operate by evaluating candidate phylogenetic trees according to an explicit optimality criterion; the tree with the most favorable score is taken as the best hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships of the included taxa. Maximum parsimony is used with most kinds of phylogenetic data; until recently, it was the only widely used character-based tree estimation method used for morphological data.

Inferring phylogenies is not a trivial problem. A huge number of possible phylogenetic trees exist for any reasonably sized set of taxa; for example, a mere ten species gives over two million possible unrooted trees. These possibilities must be searched to find a tree that best fits the data according to the optimality criterion. However, the data themselves do not lead to a simple, arithmetic solution to the problem. Ideally, we would expect the distribution of whatever evolutionary characters (such as phenotypic traits or alleles) to directly follow the branching pattern of evolution. Thus we could say that if two organisms possess a shared character, they should be more closely related to each other than to a third organism that lacks this character (provided that character was not present in the last common ancestor of all three, in which case it would be a symplesiomorphy). We would predict that bats and monkeys are more closely related to each other than either is to an elephant, because male bats and monkeys possess external testicles, which elephants lack. However, we cannot say that bats and monkeys are more closely related to one another than they are to whales, though the two have external testicles absent in whales, because we believe that the males in the last common ancestral species of the three had external testicles.

However, the phenomena of convergent evolution, parallel evolution, and evolutionary reversals (collectively termed &quot;homoplasy&quot;) add an unpleasant wrinkle to the problem of inferring phylogeny. For a number of reasons, two organisms can possess a trait inferred to have not been present in their last common ancestor: If we naively took the presence of this trait as evidence of a relationship, we would infer an incorrect tree. Empirical phylogenetic data may include substantial homoplasy, with different parts of the data suggesting sometimes very different relationships. Methods used to estimate phylogenetic trees are explicitly intended to resolve the conflict within the data by picking the phylogenetic tree that is the best fit to all the data overall, accepting that some data simply will not fit. It is often mistakenly believed that parsimony assumes that convergence is rare; in fact, even convergently derived characters have some value in maximum-parsimony-based phylogenetic analyses, and the prevalence of convergence does not systematically affect the outcome of parsimony-based methods.

Data that do not fit a tree perfectly are not simply &quot;noise&quot;, they can contain relevant phylogenetic signal in some parts of a tree, even if they conflict with the tree overall. In the whale example given above, the lack of external testicles in whales is homoplastic: It reflects a return to the condition inferred to have been present in ancient ancestors of mammals, whose testicles were internal. This inferred similarity between whales and ancient mammal ancestors is in conflict with the tree we accept based on the weight of other characters, since it implies that the mammals with external testicles should form a group excluding whales. However, among the whales, the reversal to internal testicles actually correctly associates the various types of whales (including dolphins and porpoises) into the group Cetacea. Still, the determination of the best-fitting tree—and thus which data do not fit the tree—is a complex process. Maximum parsimony is one method developed to do this.

== Character data ==
The input data used in a maximum parsimony analysis is in the form of &quot;characters&quot; for a range of taxa. There is no generally agreed-upon definition of a phylogenetic character, but operationally a character can be thought of as an attribute, an axis along which taxa are observed to vary. These attributes can be physical (morphological), molecular, genetic, physiological, or behavioral. The only widespread agreement on characters seems to be that variation used for character analysis should reflect heritable variation. Whether it must be directly heritable, or whether indirect inheritance (e.g., learned behaviors) is acceptable, is not entirely resolved.

Each character is divided into discrete character states, into which the variations observed are classified. Character states are often formulated as descriptors, describing the condition of the character substrate. For example, the character &quot;eye color&quot; might have the states &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;brown.&quot; Characters can have two or more states (they can have only one, but these characters lend nothing to a maximum parsimony analysis, and are often excluded).

Coding characters for phylogenetic analysis is not an exact science, and there are numerous complicating issues. Typically, taxa are scored with the same state if they are more similar to one another in that particular attribute than each is to taxa scored with a different state. This is not straightforward when character states are not clearly delineated or when they fail to capture all of the possible variation in a character. How would one score the previously mentioned character for a taxon (or individual) with hazel eyes? Or green? As noted above, character coding is generally based on similarity: Hazel and green eyes might be lumped with blue because they are more similar to that color (being light), and the character could be then recoded as &quot;eye color: light; dark.&quot; Alternatively, there can be multi-state characters, such as &quot;eye color: brown; hazel, blue; green.&quot;

Ambiguities in character state delineation and scoring can be a major source of confusion, dispute, and error in phylogenetic analysis using character data. Note that, in the above example, &quot;eyes: present; absent&quot; is also a possible character, which creates issues because &quot;eye color&quot; is not applicable if eyes are not present. For such situations, a &quot;?&quot; (&quot;unknown&quot;) is scored, although sometimes &quot;X&quot; or &quot;-&quot; (the latter usually in sequence data) are used to distinguish cases where a character cannot be scored from a case where the state is simply unknown. Current implementations of maximum parsimony generally treat unknown values in the same manner: the reasons the data are unknown have no particular effect on analysis. Effectively, the program treats a ? as if it held the state that would involve the fewest extra steps in the tree (see below), although this is not an explicit step in the algorithm.

Genetic data are particularly amenable to character-based phylogenetic methods such as maximum parsimony because protein and nucleotide sequences are naturally discrete: A particular position in a nucleotide sequence can be either adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine / uracil, or a sequence gap; a position (residue) in a protein sequence will be one of the basic amino acids or a sequence gap. Thus, character scoring is rarely ambiguous, except in cases where sequencing methods fail to produce a definitive assignment for a particular sequence position. Sequence gaps are sometimes treated as characters, although there is no consensus on how they should be coded.

Characters can be treated as unordered or ordered. For a binary (two-state) character, this makes little difference. For a multi-state character, unordered characters can be thought of as having an equal &quot;cost&quot; (in terms of number of &quot;evolutionary events&quot;) to change from any one state to any other; complementarily, they do not require passing through intermediate states. Ordered characters have a particular sequence in which the states must occur through evolution, such that going between some states requires passing through an intermediate. This can be thought of complementarily as having different costs to pass between different pairs of states. In the eye-color example above, it is possible to leave it unordered, which imposes the same evolutionary &quot;cost&quot; to go from brown-blue, green-blue, green-hazel, etc. Alternatively, it could be ordered brown-hazel-green-blue; this would normally imply that it would cost two evolutionary events to go from brown-green, three from brown-blue, but only one from brown-hazel. This can also be thought of as requiring eyes to evolve through a &quot;hazel stage&quot; to get from brown to green, and a &quot;green stage&quot; to get from hazel to blue, etc. For many characters, it is not obvious if and how they should be ordered. On the contrary, for characters that represent discretization of an underlying continuous variable, like shape, size, and ratio characters, ordering is logical, and simulations have shown that this improves ability to recover correct clades, while decreasing the recovering of erroneous clades.

There is a lively debate on the utility and appropriateness of character ordering, but no consensus. Some authorities order characters when there is a clear logical, ontogenetic, or evolutionary transition among the states (for example, &quot;legs: short; medium; long&quot;). Some accept only some of these criteria. Some run an unordered analysis, and order characters that show a clear order of transition in the resulting tree (which practice might be accused of circular reasoning). Some authorities refuse to order characters at all, suggesting that it biases an analysis to require evolutionary transitions to follow a particular path.

It is also possible to apply differential weighting to individual characters. This is usually done relative to a &quot;cost&quot; of 1. Thus, some characters might be seen as more likely to reflect the true evolutionary relationships among taxa, and thus they might be weighted at a value 2 or more; changes in these characters would then count as two evolutionary &quot;steps&quot; rather than one when calculating tree scores (see below). There has been much discussion in the past about character weighting. Most authorities now weight all characters equally, although exceptions are common. For example, allele frequency data is sometimes pooled in bins and scored as an ordered character. In these cases, the character itself is often downweighted so that small changes in allele frequencies count less than major changes in other characters. Also, the third codon position in a coding nucleotide sequence is particularly labile, and is sometimes downweighted, or given a weight of 0, on the assumption that it is more likely to exhibit homoplasy. In some cases, repeated analyses are run, with characters reweighted in inverse proportion to the degree of homoplasy discovered in the previous analysis (termed successive weighting); this is another technique that might be considered circular reasoning.

Character state changes can also be weighted individually. This is often done for nucleotide sequence data; it has been empirically determined that certain base changes (A-C, A-T, G-C, G-T, and the reverse changes) occur much less often than others (A-G, C-T, and their reverse changes). These changes are therefore often weighted more. As shown above in the discussion of character ordering, ordered characters can be thought of as a form of character state weighting.

Some systematists prefer to exclude characters known to be, or suspected to be, highly homoplastic or that have a large number of unknown entries (&quot;?&quot;). As noted below, theoretical and simulation work has demonstrated that this is likely to sacrifice accuracy rather than improve it. This is also the case with characters that are variable in the terminal taxa: theoretical, congruence, and simulation studies have all demonstrated that such polymorphic characters contain significant phylogenetic information.

== Taxon sampling ==
The time required for a parsimony analysis (or any phylogenetic analysis) is proportional to the number of taxa (and characters) included in the analysis. Also, because more taxa require more branches to be estimated, more uncertainty may be expected in large analyses. Because data collection costs in time and money often scale directly with the number of taxa included, most analyses include only a fraction of the taxa that could have been sampled. Indeed, some authors have contended that four taxa (the minimum required to produce a meaningful unrooted tree) are all that is necessary for accurate phylogenetic analysis, and that more characters are more valuable than more taxa in phylogenetics. This has led to a raging controversy about taxon sampling.

Empirical, theoretical, and simulation studies have led to a number of dramatic demonstrations of the importance of adequate taxon sampling. Most of these can be summarized by a simple observation: a phylogenetic data matrix has dimensions of characters &quot;times&quot; taxa. Doubling the number of taxa doubles the amount of information in a matrix just as surely as doubling the number of characters. Each taxon represents a new sample for every character, but, more importantly, it (usually) represents a new &quot;combination&quot; of character states. These character states can not only determine where that taxon is placed on the tree, they can inform the entire analysis, possibly causing different relationships among the remaining taxa to be favored by changing estimates of the pattern of character changes.

The most disturbing weakness of parsimony analysis, that of long-branch attraction (see below) is particularly pronounced with poor taxon sampling, especially in the four-taxon case. This is a well-understood case in which additional character sampling may not improve the quality of the estimate. As taxa are added, they often break up long branches (especially in the case of fossils), effectively improving the estimation of character state changes along them. Because of the richness of information added by taxon sampling, it is even possible to produce highly accurate estimates of phylogenies with hundreds of taxa using only a few thousand characters.

Although many studies have been performed, there is still much work to be done on taxon sampling strategies. Because of advances in computer performance, and the reduced cost and increased automation of molecular sequencing, sample sizes overall are on the rise, and studies addressing the relationships of hundreds of taxa (or other terminal entities, such as genes) are becoming common. Of course, this is not to say that adding characters is not also useful; the number of characters is increasing as well.

Some systematists prefer to exclude taxa based on the number of unknown character entries (&quot;?&quot;) they exhibit, or because they tend to &quot;jump around&quot; the tree in analyses (i.e., they are &quot;wildcards&quot;). As noted below, theoretical and simulation work has demonstrated that this is likely to sacrifice accuracy rather than improve it. Although these taxa may generate more most-parsimonious trees (see below), methods such as agreement subtrees and reduced consensus can still extract information on the relationships of interest.

It has been observed that inclusion of more taxa tends to lower overall support values (bootstrap percentages or decay indices, see below). The cause of this is clear: as additional taxa are added to a tree, they subdivide the branches to which they attach, and thus dilute the information that supports that branch. While support for individual branches is reduced, support for the overall relationships is actually increased. Consider analysis that produces the following tree: (fish, (lizard, (whale, (cat, monkey)))). Adding a rat and a walrus will probably reduce the support for the (whale, (cat, monkey)) clade, because the rat and the walrus may fall within this clade, or outside of the clade, and since these five animals are all relatively closely related, there should be more uncertainty about their relationships. Within error, it may be impossible to determine any of these animals&#x27; relationships relative to one another. However, the rat and the walrus will probably add character data that cements the grouping any two of these mammals exclusive of the fish or the lizard; where the initial analysis might have been misled, say, by the presence of fins in the fish and the whale, the presence of the walrus, with blubber and fins like a whale but whiskers like a cat and a rat, firmly ties the whale to the mammals.

To cope with this problem, agreement subtrees, reduced consensus, and double-decay analysis seek to identify supported relationships (in the form of &quot;n-taxon statements,&quot; such as the four-taxon statement &quot;(fish, (lizard, (cat, whale)))&quot;) rather than whole trees. If the goal of an analysis is a resolved tree, as is the case for comparative phylogenetics, these methods cannot solve the problem. However, if the tree estimate is so poorly supported, the results of any analysis derived from the tree will probably be too suspect to use anyway.

== Analysis ==
A maximum parsimony analysis runs in a very straightforward fashion. Trees are scored according to the degree to which they imply a parsimonious distribution of the character data. The most parsimonious tree for the dataset represents the preferred hypothesis of relationships among the taxa in the analysis.

Trees are scored (evaluated) by using a simple algorithm to determine how many &quot;steps&quot; (evolutionary transitions) are required to explain the distribution of each character. A step is, in essence, a change from one character state to another, although with ordered characters some transitions require more than one step. Contrary to popular belief, the algorithm does not explicitly assign particular character states to nodes (branch junctions) on a tree: the fewest steps can involve multiple, equally costly assignments and distributions of evolutionary transitions. What is optimized is the total number of changes.

There are many more possible phylogenetic trees than can be searched exhaustively for more than eight taxa or so. A number of algorithms are therefore used to search among the possible trees. Many of these involve taking an initial tree (usually the favored tree from the last iteration of the algorithm), and perturbing it to see if the change produces a higher score.

The trees resulting from parsimony search are unrooted: They show all the possible relationships of the included taxa, but they lack any statement on relative times of divergence. A particular branch is chosen to root the tree by the user. This branch is then taken to be outside all the other branches of the tree, which together form a monophyletic group. This imparts a sense of relative time to the tree. Incorrect choice of a root can result in incorrect relationships on the tree, even if the tree is itself correct in its unrooted form.

Parsimony analysis often returns a number of equally most-parsimonious trees (MPTs). A large number of MPTs is often seen as an analytical failure, and is widely believed to be related to the number of missing entries (&quot;?&quot;) in the dataset, characters showing too much homoplasy, or the presence of topologically labile &quot;wildcard&quot; taxa (which may have many missing entries). Numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the number of MPTs, including removing characters or taxa with large amounts of missing data before analysis, removing or downweighting highly homoplastic characters (successive weighting) or removing wildcard taxa (the phylogenetic trunk method) &quot;a posteriori&quot; and then reanalyzing the data.

Numerous theoretical and simulation studies have demonstrated that highly homoplastic characters, characters and taxa with abundant missing data, and &quot;wildcard&quot; taxa contribute to the analysis. Although excluding characters or taxa may appear to improve resolution, the resulting tree is based on less data, and is therefore a less reliable estimate of the phylogeny (unless the characters or taxa are non informative, see safe taxonomic reduction). Today&#x27;s general consensus is that having multiple MPTs is a valid analytical result; it simply indicates that there is insufficient data to resolve the tree completely. In many cases, there is substantial common structure in the MPTs, and differences are slight and involve uncertainty in the placement of a few taxa. There are a number of methods for summarizing the relationships within this set, including consensus trees, which show common relationships among all the taxa, and pruned agreement subtrees, which show common structure by temporarily pruning &quot;wildcard&quot; taxa from every tree until they all agree. Reduced consensus takes this one step further, by showing all subtrees (and therefore all relationships) supported by the input trees.

Even if multiple MPTs are returned, parsimony analysis still basically produces a point-estimate, lacking confidence intervals of any sort. This has often been levelled as a criticism, since there is certainly error in estimating the most-parsimonious tree, and the method does not inherently include any means of establishing how sensitive its conclusions are to this error. Several methods have been used to assess support.

Jackknifing and bootstrapping, well-known statistical resampling procedures, have been employed with parsimony analysis. The jackknife, which involves resampling without replacement (&quot;leave-one-out&quot;) can be employed on characters or taxa; interpretation may become complicated in the latter case, because the variable of interest is the tree, and comparison of trees with different taxa is not straightforward. The bootstrap, resampling with replacement (sample x items randomly out of a sample of size x, but items can be picked multiple times), is only used on characters, because adding duplicate taxa does not change the result of a parsimony analysis. The bootstrap is much more commonly employed in phylogenetics (as elsewhere); both methods involve an arbitrary but large number of repeated iterations involving perturbation of the original data followed by analysis. The resulting MPTs from each analysis are pooled, and the results are usually presented on a 50% Majority Rule Consensus tree, with individual branches (or nodes) labelled with the percentage of bootstrap MPTs in which they appear. This &quot;bootstrap percentage&quot; (which is not a P-value, as is sometimes claimed) is used as a measure of support. Technically, it is supposed to be a measure of repeatability, the probability that that branch (node, clade) would be recovered if the taxa were sampled again. Experimental tests with viral phylogenies suggest that the bootstrap percentage is not a good estimator of repeatability for phylogenetics, but it is a reasonable estimator of accuracy. In fact, it has been shown that the bootstrap percentage, as an estimator of accuracy, is biased, and that this bias results on average in an underestimate of confidence (such that as little as 70% support might really indicate up to 95% confidence). However, the direction of bias cannot be ascertained in individual cases, so assuming that high values bootstrap support indicate even higher confidence is unwarranted.

Another means of assessing support is Bremer support, or the decay index which is a parameter of a given data set, rather than an estimate based on pseudoreplicated subsamples, as are the bootstrap and jackknife procedures described above. Bremer support (also known as branch support) is simply the difference in number of steps between the score of the MPT(s), and the score of the most parsimonious tree that does &quot;not&quot; contain a particular clade (node, branch). It can be thought of as the number of steps you have to add to lose that clade; implicitly, it is meant to suggest how great the error in the estimate of the score of the MPT must be for the clade to no longer be supported by the analysis, although this is not necessarily what it does. Branch support values are often fairly low for modestly-sized data sets (one or two steps being typical), but they often appear to be proportional to bootstrap percentages. As data matrices become larger, branch support values often continue to increase as bootstrap values plateau at 100%. Thus, for large data matrices, branch support values may provide a more informative means to compare support for strongly-supported branches. However, interpretation of decay values is not straightforward, and they seem to be preferred by authors with philosophical objections to the bootstrap (although many morphological systematists, especially paleontologists, report both). Double-decay analysis is a decay counterpart to reduced consensus that evaluates the decay index for all possible subtree relationships (n-taxon statements) within a tree.

== Problems with maximum parsimony phylogenetic inference ==

Maximum parsimony is an epistemologically straightforward approach that makes few mechanistic assumptions, and is popular for this reason. However, it may not be statistically consistent under certain circumstances. Consistency, here meaning the monotonic convergence on the correct answer with the addition of more data, is a desirable property of statistical methods. As demonstrated in 1978 by Joe Felsenstein, maximum parsimony can be inconsistent under certain conditions. The category of situations in which this is known to occur is called &quot;long branch attraction&quot;, and occurs, for example, where there are long branches (a high level of substitutions) for two characters (A &amp; C), but short branches for another two (B &amp; D). A and B diverged from a common ancestor, as did C and D. Of course, to know that a method is giving you the wrong answer, you would need to know what the correct answer is. This is generally not the case in science. For this reason, some view statistical consistency as irrelevant to empirical phylogenetic questions.

Assume for simplicity that we are considering a single binary character (it can either be + or -). Because the distance from B to D is small, in the vast majority of all cases, B and D will be the same. Here, we will assume that they are both + (+ and - are assigned arbitrarily and swapping them is only a matter of definition). If this is the case, there are four remaining possibilities. A and C can both be +, in which case all taxa are the same and all the trees have the same length. A can be + and C can be -, in which case only one character is different, and we cannot learn anything, as all trees have the same length. Similarly, A can be - and C can be +. The only remaining possibility is that A and C are both -. In this case, however, the evidence suggests that A and C group together, and B and D together. As a consequence, if the &quot;true tree&quot; is a tree of this type, the more data we collect (i.e. the more characters we study), the more the evidence will support the wrong tree. Of course, except in mathematical simulations, we never know what the &quot;true tree&quot; is. Thus, unless we are able to devise a model that is guaranteed to accurately recover the &quot;true tree,&quot; any other optimality criterion or weighting scheme could also, in principle, be statistically inconsistent. The bottom line is, that while statistical inconsistency is an interesting theoretical issue, it is empirically a purely metaphysical concern, outside the realm of empirical testing. Any method could be inconsistent, and there is no way to know for certain whether it is, or not. It is for this reason that many systematists characterize their phylogenetic results as hypotheses of relationship.

Another complication with maximum parsimony, and other optimality-criterion based phylogenetic methods, is that finding the shortest tree is an NP-hard problem. The only currently available, efficient way of obtaining a solution, given an arbitrarily large set of taxa, is by using heuristic methods which do not guarantee that the shortest tree will be recovered. These methods employ hill-climbing algorithms to progressively approach the best tree. However, it has been shown that there can be &quot;tree islands&quot; of suboptimal solutions, and the analysis can become trapped in these local optima. Thus, complex, flexible heuristics are required to ensure that tree space has been adequately explored. Several heuristics are available, including nearest neighbor interchange (NNI), tree bisection reconnection (TBR), and the parsimony ratchet.

== Criticism ==
It has been asserted that a major problem, especially for paleontology, is that maximum parsimony assumes that the only way two species can share the same nucleotide at the same position is if they are genetically related. This asserts that phylogenetic applications of parsimony assume that all similarity is homologous (other interpretations, such as the assertion that two organisms might &quot;not&quot; be related at all, are nonsensical). This is emphatically not the case: as with any form of character-based phylogeny estimation, parsimony is used to test the homologous nature of similarities by finding the phylogenetic tree which best accounts for all of the similarities.

It is often stated that parsimony is not relevant to phylogenetic inference because &quot;evolution is not parsimonious.&quot; In most cases, there is no explicit alternative proposed; if no alternative is available, any statistical method is preferable to none at all. Additionally, it is not clear what would be meant if the statement &quot;evolution is parsimonious&quot; were in fact true. This could be taken to mean that more character changes may have occurred historically than are predicted using the parsimony criterion. Because parsimony phylogeny estimation reconstructs the minimum number of changes necessary to explain a tree, this is quite possible. However, it has been shown through simulation studies, testing with known in vitro viral phylogenies, and congruence with other methods, that the accuracy of parsimony is in most cases not compromised by this. Parsimony analysis uses the number of character changes on trees to choose the best tree, but it does not require that exactly that many changes, and no more, produced the tree. As long as the changes that have not been accounted for are randomly distributed over the tree (a reasonable null expectation), the result should not be biased. In practice, the technique is robust: maximum parsimony exhibits minimal bias as a result of choosing the tree with the fewest changes.

An analogy can be drawn with choosing among contractors based on their initial (nonbinding) estimate of the cost of a job. The actual finished cost is very likely to be higher than the estimate. Despite this, choosing the contractor who furnished the lowest estimate should theoretically result in the lowest final project cost. This is because, in the absence of other data, we would assume that all of the relevant contractors have the same risk of cost overruns. In practice, of course, unscrupulous business practices may bias this result; in phylogenetics, too, some particular phylogenetic problems (for example, long branch attraction, described above) may potentially bias results. In both cases, however, there is no way to tell if the result is going to be biased, or the degree to which it will be biased, based on the estimate itself. With parsimony too, there is no way to tell that the data are positively misleading, without comparison to other evidence.

Parsimony is often characterized as implicitly adopting the position that evolutionary change is rare, or that homoplasy (convergence and reversal) is minimal in evolution. This is not entirely true: parsimony minimizes the number of convergences and reversals that are assumed by the preferred tree, but this may result in a relatively large number of such homoplastic events. It would be more appropriate to say that parsimony assumes only the minimum amount of change implied by the data. As above, this does not require that these were the only changes that occurred; it simply does not infer changes for which there is no evidence. The shorthand for describing this, to paraphrase Farris is that &quot;parsimony minimizes assumed homoplasies, it does not assume that homoplasy is minimal.&quot;

Recent simulation studies suggest that parsimony may be less accurate than trees built using Bayesian approaches for morphological data, potentially due to overprecision, although this has been disputed. Studies using novel simulation methods have demonstrated that differences between inference methods result from the search strategy and consensus method employed, rather than the optimization used. Also, analyses of 38 molecular and 86 morphological empirical datasets have shown that the common mechanism assumed by the evolutionary models used in model-based phylogenetics apply to most molecular, but few morphological datasets. This finding validates the use of model-based phylogenetics for molecular data, but suggests that for morphological data, parsimony remains advantageous, at least until more sophisticated models become available for phenotypic data.

== Alternatives ==

There are several other methods for inferring phylogenies based on discrete character data, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Each offers potential advantages and disadvantages. In practice, these methods tend to favor trees that are very similar to the most parsimonious tree(s) for the same dataset; however, they allow for complex modelling of evolutionary processes, and as classes of methods are statistically consistent and are not susceptible to long-branch attraction. Note, however, that the performance of likelihood and Bayesian methods are dependent on the quality of the particular model of evolution employed; an incorrect model can produce a biased result - just like parsimony. In addition, they are still quite computationally slow relative to parsimony methods, sometimes requiring weeks to run large datasets. Most of these methods have particularly avid proponents and detractors; parsimony especially has been advocated as philosophically superior (most notably by ardent cladists). One area where parsimony still holds much sway is in the analysis of morphological data, because—until recently—stochastic models of character change were not available for non-molecular data, and they are still not widely implemented. Parsimony has also recently been shown to be more likely to recover the true tree in the face of profound changes in evolutionary (&quot;model&quot;) parameters (e.g., the rate of evolutionary change) within a tree.

Distance matrices can also be used to generate phylogenetic trees. Non-parametric distance methods were originally applied to phenetic data using a matrix of pairwise distances and reconciled to produce a tree. The distance matrix can come from a number of different sources, including immunological distance, morphometric analysis, and genetic distances. For phylogenetic character data, raw distance values can be calculated by simply counting the number of pairwise differences in character states (Manhattan distance) or by applying a model of evolution. Notably, distance methods also allow use of data that may not be easily converted to character data, such as DNA-DNA hybridization assays. Today, distance-based methods are often frowned upon because phylogenetically-informative data can be lost when converting characters to distances. There are a number of distance-matrix methods and optimality criteria, of which the minimum evolution criterion is most closely related to maximum parsimony.

=== Minimum Evolution ===

From among the distance methods, there exists a phylogenetic estimation criterion, known as Minimum Evolution (ME), that shares with maximum-parsimony the aspect of searching for the phylogeny that has the shortest total sum of branch lengths.

A subtle difference distinguishes the maximum-parsimony criterion from the ME criterion: while maximum-parsimony is based on an abductive heuristic, i.e., the plausibility of the simplest evolutionary hypothesis of taxa with respect to the more complex ones, the ME criterion is based on Kidd and Sgaramella-Zonta&#x27;s conjectures (proven true 22 years later by Rzhetsky and Nei) stating that if the evolutionary distances from taxa were unbiased estimates of the true evolutionary distances then the true phylogeny of taxa would have a length shorter than any other alternative phylogeny compatible with those distances. Rzhetsky and Nei&#x27;s results set the ME criterion free from the Occam&#x27;s razor principle and confer it a solid theoretical and quantitative basis.

<text>Kenwyne Joel Jones CM (born 5 October 1984) is a Trinidadian football manager and retired professional player who played as a forward. He managed the Trinidad and Tobago women&#x27;s national team. He began his football career with Joe Public F.C. in his native Trinidad and Tobago. He moved to W Connection in 2002, and he was a utility player in the Trinidad and Tobago team in 2003 against Finland. In 2004, he joined Southampton, where he was converted to a striker. He was later loaned to Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City during the 2004–05 season.

In 2007, he joined Sunderland for £6 million where he spent three seasons before he signed for Stoke City in August 2010. In his first season at Stoke Jones scored 12 goals and played in the 2011 FA Cup Final. Following the arrival of Peter Crouch in August 2011, Jones struggled to hold down a regular place in the side which saw him score just four more league goals in the next three seasons. In January 2014 he joined Cardiff City in a player-exchange with Peter Odemwingie. Whilst with Cardiff he spent time out on loan at AFC Bournemouth and Al Jazira before moving to Atlanta United in the summer of 2016. Jones decided to retire from football in November 2017.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Jones was born in Point Fortin, Trinidad and Tobago, to Lydia and Pamphile. and he attended St. Anthony&#x27;s College in Trinidad along with his future Sunderland teammate Carlos Edwards. His uncle, Philibert Jones, was also a footballer as a prolific forward for Strike Squad that came within a point of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup and was a similar player to Kenwyne; both in style and celebration.

He had earlier had trials at Manchester United and Middlesbrough in 2002, and further trials at West Ham United and Rangers in 2004. Jones revealed in an interview with Simon Bird that he had to travel around Europe looking for a football club, or face a career in the Trinidad army; he said &quot;It was hard because I&#x27;d just had my son and it was make it — or join the army. I had a family to support and at that time, it was either this is it... or I go into the services. I was ready for that life.&quot; Jones began his professional career with Joe Public in his native Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. He soon moved to W Connection where he played for two years.

===Southampton===
In July 2004, Jones signed for Southampton from W Connection for a nominal fee after a trial. W Connection&#x27;s Chairman David John Williams described Jones&#x27; move, saying: &quot;When Kenwyne Jones was transferred to Southampton, I told you all that he is going to be the biggest thing in Trinidad and Tobago football since beside Dwight Yorke&quot;. In December 2004, while on loan to the Football League One club Sheffield Wednesday, he scored seven goals in seven games, and returned to Southampton in January 2005, where he played in games against Liverpool and local rivals Portsmouth. He joined Championship side Stoke City in February 2005 on loan where he played 13 times scoring three goals.

Before the start of the 2006–07 season, Jones scored a hat trick against Anderlecht in Southampton&#x27;s last pre-season game. Meanwhile, in the Football League Championship Jones scored two goals against Birmingham City on 29 November that ended 4–3 to Southampton. On 26 December 2006, he received the first red card of his career for a push on Mark Hudson in the match against Crystal Palace. He scored another two goals against Southend United in a 4–1 win on the last day of the season to ensure a place in the play-offs for Southampton, following this, Jones was injured for the play-off semi-final defeat at Derby County but finished the season with 16 goals.

On 11 May 2007, Southampton manager George Burley stated that &quot;Kenwyne is another Didier Drogba in the making, as far as physical attributes, his strength and power in the air are second to none&quot;. This followed news that Derby County wanted to sign Jones for around £5.5 million. Jones submitted a transfer request to Southampton on 24 August 2007 and went on &quot;strike&quot; until a move could be agreed, requesting not to be selected for the forthcoming league match against Stoke City.

===Sunderland===

On 29 August 2007, it was confirmed that he had joined Sunderland in a deal valued at £6 million with fellow-Trinidadian Stern John moving to Southampton. The Trinidadian striker made his debut for Sunderland on 1 September in a 1–0 defeat to Manchester United and scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 home win over Reading on 15 September.

Jones was linked with a £12 million player move to Liverpool in November 2007, with Peter Crouch moving to Sunderland. Jones was again linked with high-profile clubs on 21 December 2007, including Chelsea and Liverpool, but Sunderland manager Roy Keane insisted that he would be going nowhere. Jones scored his fifth goal at the Stadium of Light, with a header from the near post off a corner kick, in Sunderland&#x27;s 3–1 win over Bolton Wanderers on 29 December. Chelsea captain John Terry praised Jones, saying he was probably the &quot;best in the air&quot; in the Premier League&quot; after Chelsea had won the match 1–0 on 15 March 2008.

On 1 June 2008, Jones suffered a knee ligament injury in a collision with goalkeeper David James in the seventh minute of Trinidad &amp; Tobago&#x27;s 3–0 defeat against England. He made his first appearance of the 2008–09 season playing for 60 minutes in Sunderland reserve team&#x27;s 2–0 victory against Wigan Athletic., followed by a return to Sunderland&#x27;s first team in the Tyne–Wear derby on 25 October 2008 as a second-half substitute, when he helped Sunderland to secure a 2–1 victory over their local rivals. His first goal following his return came on 12 November in a 2–1 League Cup defeat against Blackburn Rovers. He continued his recovery from injury with a goal, again against Blackburn, on 15 November 2008 as Sunderland won 2–1.

Jones put an end to speculation linking him with a move to Tottenham Hotspur by signing a -year contract at the Stadium of Light on 27 January 2009. After a spell of six games without a goal, Jones scored against Manchester United in a 2–1 defeat. On 22 August Jones contributed to Sunderland&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers scoring two goals. Jones again contributed with two goals for Sunderland when they were at home to Wolves on 27 September, in a 5–2 win. One goal being the highlight of the game, curling the ball home from 22yards out. Jones scored his fifth goal of the season with a header against Manchester United, outjumping Ben Foster to give Sunderland a 2–1 lead but in the dying moments of the match at Old Trafford, Patrice Evra&#x27;s shot was deflected in for an own-goal by Anton Ferdinand to level it up and end the match as a 2–2 draw. Jones scored his sixth goal of the season with a close-range header against Manchester City which City won 4–3. On 6 February, Jones scored his seventh goal of the season with another header against Wigan Athletic which ended up 1–1 at the Stadium of Light. Jones then scored again against Manchester City bringing his tally to eight, with a spectacular header at the Stadium of Light, which ended up 1–1. He also opened the scoring against Wolves on the final day of the season, netting after a strike deflected off Jody Craddock after 8 minutes, but Wolves would go on to win 2–1.

===Stoke City===
On 11 August 2010, Jones signed for Stoke City on a four-year deal for a club record fee of £8 million. Jones took a wage cut in order to join Stoke. 

Jones took over the number 9 shirt from the departing James Beattie who had joined Rangers. He made his second debut for City against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 14 August 2010, he made a bright start hitting the crossbar with his first shot. However, after falling awkwardly from a challenge from Jody Craddock on 14 minutes Jones was forced to come off. On 13 September, Jones scored his first goal for Stoke on his home debut against Aston Villa in a 2–1 win. Jones followed this by scoring against West Ham United, Fulham in the League Cup and Newcastle United. He scored the second goal on 13 November in a 2–0 win against Liverpool at the Britannia Stadium.

After six games without a goal and some criticism from supporters, manager Pulis revealed that Jones has had personal problems which have affected his performances. He ended this run with a goal against Everton on New Year&#x27;s Day. However, he again went on a goal drought this time for three months before scoring against Tottenham Hotspur in April. He then went on a similar scoring run he had at the start of the season scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers and then had an opportunity to become the first Stoke player to score in four consecutive Premier League matches against Blackpool but he missed an open goal. He made amends the following match scoring against Arsenal in a 3–1 win. Jones played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1–0 to Manchester City, he had Stoke&#x27;s best chance in the match going through one on one with Joe Hart who saved Jones&#x27; effort. Jones ended the 2010–11 as joint top goalscorer with Jonathan Walters, both scored 12 goals. Jones said that he had a &#x27;topsy-turvy&#x27; first season at Stoke.

Jones started the 2011–12 season well scoring against Norwich City and twice against FC Thun in the UEFA Europa League. With Stoke signing Peter Crouch at the end of August, Jones found himself out of favour and was restricted to cup and European matches. This has led to speculation that Jones could be leaving the club in the 2012 January transfer window but Pulis insists that he is still in his plans. He scored an historic goal for Stoke against Dynamo Kyiv to earn them a 1–1 draw which secured Stoke&#x27;s qualification to the knock-out stage of the Europa League. In 2012–13 Jones remained behind Crouch in Pulis&#x27; starting line-up restricting him to cameo appearances off the bench. He regained his place in December 2012 after injury to Crouch and scored his first Premier League goal for sixteen months in a 1–1 draw with Everton. Jones continued his revival scoring against Liverpool on boxing day, and against his old club Southampton on 29 December. Jones lost his place once Crouch had returned to the side and he ended the season on a sour note as he was involved in a dressing room bust-up with Glenn Whelan. At the end of the season Tony Pulis was replaced by Mark Hughes and Jones was critical of the style of football played under Pulis.

Jones began the 2013–14 season by scoring his first professional hat-trick against Walsall in the League Cup on 28 August 2013. On 12 January 2014, Jones failed to arrive for Stoke&#x27;s home game against Liverpool citing &quot;personal problems&quot;, he was then fined two weeks wages by Hughes for his non-appearance.

===Cardiff City===
On 28 January 2014, Jones joined Cardiff City in a player-exchange with Peter Odemwingie. Jones scored a debut goal for the Bluebirds on 1 February 2014, netting the winner in a 2–1 triumph against Norwich City, just one minute after Craig Bellamy had equalised. He played 11 times for Cardiff in the 2013–14 as they suffered relegation to the Championship.

Jones started the 2014–15 season strongly, scoring 9 in the first half of the season. However Jones tailed off in 2015, only managing to find the net twice. Due to Cardiff cutting costs, Jones was loaned to league leaders AFC Bournemouth for the remainder of the season, despite being Cardiff&#x27;s top goal scorer. Jones scored on his debut for the Cherries on 3 April 2015 helping them to earn a 1–1 draw against Ipswich Town. Jones made six substitute appearances for the Cherries as they won the Championship title, gaining promotion to the Premier League.

Upon returning to Cardiff, Jones found himself on the bench following an injury picked up on international duty over the summer. Jones&#x27; return to the first XI, resulted in him finding himself on the score sheet in a 2–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Initial reports that his form had inclined manager, Russell Slade to open contract talks with him and the club in the final months of 2015 turned out to be untrue.

On 5 January 2016, Jones joined UAE-based club Al Jazira on loan until the end of the 2015–16 season.

===Atlanta United===
On 15 July 2016, Jones signed for newly formed Major League Soccer side Atlanta United for their inaugural 2017 season. Jones was released by Atlanta at the end of the 2017 season. On 10 December 2017, his MLS rights were traded by Atlanta to Sporting Kansas City in exchange for a second-round selection in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft, midfielder Kévin Oliveira, and defender Tyler Pasher. Kansas City also received goalkeeper Alexander Tambakis and a fourth-round selection in the 2021 MLS SuperDraft as part of the trade.

==International career==
Jones has been capped at under-18, under-20, under-23 olympic team and the Trinidad and Tobago national team.

He made his debut for the Trinidad and Tobago national team on 29 January 2003 in a match against Finland. Jones scored his first goal on 25 May 2005 in a 4–0 win against Bermuda. He was later selected by Trinidad and Tobago for their 2006 World Cup campaign, where he made his first appearance in the competition in a 2–0 defeat against England on 15 June 2006 at Frankenstadion, Nuremberg. Jones was named as Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation&#x27;s Player of the Year for 2007. Jones said, &quot;A lot of big names have won this before and I never really thought about something like this happening to me&quot;. Jones was named as captain of the &quot;Soca Warriors&quot; in August 2011 by manager Otto Pfister.

==Managerial career==
In October 2021, Jones was appointed as the interim coach of the Trinidad and Tobago women&#x27;s national team. The following month, he was named as the full-time coach.

==Personal life==
As a member of the squad that competed at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Jones was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold Class), the second highest state decoration of Trinidad and Tobago.

He earned his U.S. green card in February 2017. This status qualified him as a domestic player for MLS roster purposes.

<doc id="1130027" wikidata="Q1502635" url="?curid=1130027" title="Orchid (hardcore punk band)">
<text>Orchid is an American screamo band from Amherst, Massachusetts. Originally active from 1997 until 2002, they released several EPs and splits as well as three studio albums. The band consists of lead vocalist Jayson Green, drummer Jeffrey Salane, guitarist Will Killingsworth, guitarist Brad Wallace and bassist Geoff Garlock.

Orchid released three full-length albums during their initial run and played their final show on the same day as the release of their final album. The band reunited for a tour in 2024, their first shows in 22 years.

== History ==
The band was formed while Jayson Green, Will Killingsworth, and Brad Wallace were studying at Hampshire College, and Jeff Salane was attending the University of Massachusetts Amherst in early 1998. 

Orchid released three albums: &quot;Chaos Is Me&quot; in 1999, &quot;Dance Tonight! Revolution Tomorrow&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Gatefold&quot; in 2002. The band played their final show of their original run on July 9, 2002, the release date of &quot;Gatefold&quot;.

In 2005, a compilation album titled &quot;Totality&quot; was released posthumously. It comprised 24 tracks, featuring out-of-press and hard-to-find B-side and split EP materials that were previously only available on vinyl.

Jayson Green later formed a hardcore punk supergroup named Violent Bullshit, with members of Black Army Jacket and the Fiery Furnaces. Jayson Green, Will Killingsworth, and Geoff Garlock currently play together in the band Ritual Mess.

Green provided vocals on &quot;Pow Pow&quot;, the lead single to LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;This Is Happening&quot;.

The band received numerous offers to reunite, the most lucrative coming from Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands, but Green did not tell his bandmates as the band had been disinterested in coming back. After an interview with Machine Music Green, Killingsworth and Wallace, the band began the process of reuniting. In December 2023, Orchid announced a reunion and tour in 2024. The band&#x27;s first show in 22 years took place on May 5, 2024 at The Drake in Amherst, Massachusetts. For their reunion shows, original bassist Brad Wallace rejoined the band as an additional guitarist.

== Style ==
Orchid&#x27;s musical style (which primarily has been described as hardcore punk and screamo) is highly dissonant, fast, and chaotic. It combines the melodic and poetic approach of post-hardcore and emo with the extremity of powerviolence (a fusion sometimes termed emoviolence) and grindcore. Italian site &quot;Emotional Breakdown&quot; gave a positive review of Orchid&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Totality&quot;, saying: &quot;[Orchid] are the concentrated essence of the most poignant music you can imagine: the vocal cords that are pulled until they tear, the music sounds dark and desperate. They possess all these characteristics as the undisputed masters they have taught many proselytes, in all of their cynical splendor.&quot;

==Legacy==
Orchid is regarded as a prominent and quintessential band in screamo. Lars Gotrich of NPR music credited Orchid (alongside bands Pg 99, Circle Takes the Square and Majority Rule) as being prominent influences on emotional post-hardcore. Green said, &quot;we just called ourselves a hardcore band.&quot; 

Canadian post-hardcore band Silverstein covered &quot;Destination: Blood&quot; on their album &quot;Short Songs&quot;. A tribute album, &quot;Epilogue of a Car Crash!&quot;, was released in 2013 on Dog Knights Productions. Piet Onthel covered &quot;Weekend At The Fire Academy&quot; on their demo in 2018. Letters of Marque covered &quot;Lights Out&quot; on &quot;Spring Roots &amp; Lullabies&quot;, a charity compilation for Trans Lifeline released in 2023.

<doc id="1130045" wikidata="Q4720626" url="?curid=1130045" title="Alexandra Dock, Liverpool">
<text>Alexandra Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Bootle. Alexandra Dock consists of a main basin nearest the river wall and three branch docks to the east, with the southern branch mostly filled in. 

==History==

The dock was built by George Fosbery Lyster between 1874 and 1882. During its construction, the dock was known as Atlantic Dock for about a year. Opened in 1881 and named in honour of Queen Alexandra, the dock has three branch docks and is connected to Hornby Dock to the north and Langton Dock to the south. Initially, access was through Langton Dock and the problematic Canada Basin.

Prior to the construction of Seaforth Dock, Alexandra Dock was involved in the grain trade. The grain silos had a 110,000 ton capacity, with floor space for a further 20,000 tons. The dock also had refrigeration facilities, which were provided by Union Cold Storage, for imported frozen meat. When built, the cold store was the largest in Europe with a capacity of . The facility was built at the end of No. 3 Branch Dock, and allowed direct transfer to ships in No. 2 Branch Dock.
The dock was served by LNWR Alexandra Dock railway station and the Liverpool Overhead Railway&#x27;s Alexandra Dock (LOR) railway station.

Latterly, its main export is recycled scrap metal.

<doc id="1130049" wikidata="Q726629" url="?curid=1130049" title="Collin Samuel">
<text>Collin Andrew Samuel CM (born 27 August 1981) is a Trinidad and Tobago former professional footballer who played as a winger or striker. He represented Trinidad and Tobago at senior international level and played in the 2006 World Cup. He played abroad professionally for a number of clubs in Scotland, including Falkirk, Dundee United and St Johnstone, as well as Toronto FC in Canada and Luton Town in England.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Samuel began his career with Doc&#x27;s Khelwalaas of his native Trinidad, where he played from 1998 to 2000. In 2000, he moved to one of the nation&#x27;s largest clubs, San Juan Jabloteh, where he played the 2001 and 2002 seasons.

===Falkirk===
Samuel moved to Scotland in August 2002 when he was scouted by Simon Lindsay for Falkirk. He scored 16 goals in 42 appearances in his first season for the then-Scottish First Division side, including a first half hat-trick in a 4–0 Scottish Cup victory against Hearts. During his spell with Falkirk, he had an unsuccessful trial with Everton in the English Premier League.

===Dundee United===
Samuel moved to Scottish Premier League club Dundee United on 11 July 2003 for £100,000.

Samuel was not as prolific at Tannadice, scoring just 15 goals in total during his four seasons there. Despite scoring on his debut, Samuel managed just one more all season and failed to score at all during 2004–05. Samuel was part of the Dundee United match day squad which participated in the Scottish Cup final in season 2004–05 against Celtic. Despite losing that cup final 1–0, the team still qualified for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup in which Samuel scored against Finnish team, MyPa, at Tannadice in the second leg of the qualifying round tie. Finding his form somewhat that particular season, he managed seven goals, including three in four games during December. In 2006–07, however, Samuel scored five times for United. Generally starting from the bench, he was frequently used as a right midfielder or as a forward. Samuel was told he was free to leave Dundee United at the end of the 2006–07 season, with interest shown by Major League Soccer side Toronto FC and Scottish First Division side, St Johnstone. Samuel subsequently played his last game for Dundee United in their final game of the 2006–07 season, a 0–0 draw at home to Motherwell.

===Toronto FC===
After being released by Dundee United, media speculation increasingly linked him with moves to a team in the Major League Soccer and the aforementioned St Johnstone. Samuel eventually signed for MLS side Toronto FC, during which time he started every game for the Canadian club, making 19 appearances and scoring three goals for the injury-racked club in their inaugural season. He was released from Toronto FC in April 2008 for personal reasons, with the club allowed a limited number of international players on their roster.

===St Johnstone===
Samuel then signed a two-year deal with Scottish First Division side St Johnstone on 6 May 2008 where he proceeded to play no small part in the campaign that led to promotion back to the Scottish Premier League for the 2009–10 season.

Despite being injured for half of the season in St Johnstone&#x27;s return to the SPL in 2009–10, he still managed seven SPL goals plus one in the cup. He has signed a one-year contract for the 2010–11 campaign, scoring three goals in 36 appearances over the season. He was released at the end of his contract in May 2011.

===Later career===
Samuel was signed on 31 August 2011, the transfer deadline day, by Luton Town of the English Conference Premier, but left the club by mutual consent after playing one game.

Following an unsuccessful trial with Livingston, Samuel signed for Scottish Second Division club Arbroath on 20 January 2012 until the end of the 2011–12 season. In the summer of 2012, Samuel moved to East Fife, another Second Division club until the end of the season.

In August 2013, Samuel had a successful trial with Junior outfit Sauchie and signed a contract for the 2013–14 season.

In 2015 he became James Baird&#x27;s player/assistant manager at Guaya United. In February 2016, he joined North East Stars as a player-coach

Samuel returned to Scotland for work and joined Mill AFC as player/coach.

==International career==
Samuel played for the Trinidad and Tobago national team, having made his debut on 11 January 2002. He played for the team in the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup and was called up to the 2006 World Cup squad. He started the opening group match against Sweden and helped the team earn a goalless draw.

As a member of the squad that competed at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Samuel was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold Class), the second highest state decoration of Trinidad and Tobago.

<text>Keigo Abe (October 28 1938 – December 21 2019) was a Japanese master of Shotokan karate who founded the Japan Shotokan Karate Association in 1999 and is its Chief Instructor. He held the rank of 9th &quot;dan&quot; in karate, was a direct student of Masatoshi Nakayama (1913–1987), and was a senior instructor in the Japan Karate Association.

==Early life==
Abe was born on October 28, 1938, in the town of Iyoshi, Ehime Prefecture (on the island of Shikoku), Japan. Abe&#x27;s ancestors included samurai; he has told of an incident from the past where two thieves had entered his family home, saying, &quot;My family killed them; the two graves are still standing near my house.&quot; In 1953, aged 15 years, he began training in the martial arts of karate and judo. He initially began studying the Shito-ryu style of karate.

In 1956, Abe entered the Nihon University in Tokyo, studying engineering, and graduated four years later. He began training at the &quot;honbu dojo&quot; (headquarters training hall) of the Japan Karate Association (JKA) in 1958 under Masatoshi Nakayama. In an interview in 2000, he said, &quot;Nakayama Sensei was very serious. He trained us very hard and always encouraged us to not only train hard, but to intellectually study what we were training. He stressed understanding ourselves and being good human beings.&quot;

==Karate career==
In 1961, Abe fought a notable tournament match against Keinosuke Enoeda, losing by decision after six extensions. He graduated from the JKA instructors&#x27; training program in 1965, and was a long-serving member of the instructing team at JKA&#x27;s &quot;honbu dojo&quot;. Like other &quot;kenshusei&quot; (junior instructors) of the day, Abe would practice his techniques on the streets against local gangsters to improve his fighting skills. Through Nakayama, Abe worked on the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967). Nakayama had been invited to appear in the movie, but was unable to do so due to prior commitments, and so recommended Abe instead.

Nakayama wrote that Abe&#x27;s strengths were his backfist technique and his use of distancing, strengths also noted by others years later. He had an accomplished record as a karate tournament competitor, taking first place in the inaugural JKA National Championship, first place in the team competition at the 1973 JKA International Friendship Tournament, and first place in the second and third Japan Karatedo Federation National Championships (representing Tokyo).

Abe had a close working relationship with Nakayama, benefiting from his technical knowledge and assisting him with teaching. He was one of several instructors who demonstrated techniques in Nakayama&#x27;s books on karate. In 1985, two years before Nakayama&#x27;s death, Abe was appointed as Director of Qualifications in the JKA. After the division of the JKA in 1990, he became the Technical Director of the JKA (Matsuno faction). He was responsible for formulating the &quot;ippon shobu&quot; tournament rules, which are used by most Shotokan karate competitors today.

==Later life==
Abe resigned from the JKA (Matsuno faction) on January 31, 1999. On February 10, 1999, he formed his own organization, the Japan Shotokan Karate Association (JSKA). When asked about his organization in 2000, he said, &quot;Unlike most leaders of Karate organizations, I do not want my organization to grow very large. Very large organizations mean very large problems. I want a smaller organization where I can be an active part of everyone’s life and a high degree of quality can be maintained.&quot;

Regarding training in multiple martial arts, Abe has said, &quot;In the old days the Bushi (warriors) would train in maybe 18 different arts out of battlefield necessity ... yes I would recommend cross-training.&quot; Apart from karate, he has also practiced iaido for more than 30 years, and also teaches this martial art. In his 60s, he was still training four or five mornings each week, involving karate practice and weight training, as well as teaching karate in Tokyo. Abe visited Australia in January 2008 and Cyprus in May 2009.

In 2010, Abe is due to teach in several European countries, most notably at the 5th JSKA World Karate Championship in Portugal, as well as visiting Sweden, Estonia, India, Iran, Israel, Mexico, and the United States of America. Abe died on December 21, 2019, at the age of 81.

<text>The Adventure Babies were a Stafford-based Britpop band, founded by Matt Tedstone, Dave Atherton and Jez Bramwell in 1990. The band had three releases on the Factory Records label:
* &quot;The Camper Van&quot; (EP) (FAC 319, 1991)
* &quot;Laugh&quot; (album) (FACT 335, 1992)
* &quot;Barking Mad&quot; (single) (FACT 347, 1992)

The Adventure Babies were the last band signed by Factory Records before it went bankrupt. At the time of Factory&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1992, test pressings had been made of a second single from the &quot;Laugh&quot; album, the title track.

The band continued playing with new guitarist Vulch (Bryan Wilkin) for a year, seeking a new recording contract.

A second album, &quot;Once Upon A Time The End&quot;, was issued in 2005, on CD only. In 2018 this was followed by a digital-only album release, &quot;Extracts of the Next&quot;.

<text>Pachyderm Recording Studio is a residential music recording studio located in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, United States.

==History==

The studio was founded in 1988 by Jim Nickel, Mark Walk and Eric S. Anderson, with acoustic design by Bret Theney of Westlake Audio. Located 35.8 mi (57.6 km) southeast of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, it is located in a secluded old-growth forest in rural Minnesota. The studio featured the same Neve 8068 recording console that was used in Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s Electric Lady Studios as well as Studer tape machines. The house was designed by Herb Bloomberg, architect of Old Log Theatre and founder of the Chanhassen Dinner Theatres.

The studio went into a decline in the mid-2000s, after original co-owner Jim Nickel sold the property. It went into a state of disrepair for many years, though bands occasionally still recorded there. It was purchased by engineer John Kuker in 2011 out of foreclosure and remodeled over the next three years. Kuker died on February 2, 2015, at the age of 40, after which his family took over ownership.

The home, studio and grounds were renovated. The studio is managed by longtime Kuker employee Nick Tveitbakk and clients are still able to record with the wide variety of musical equipment and guitars that Kuker collected.

<text>When the crown of Scotland became vacant in September 1290 on the death of the seven-year-old Queen Margaret, 13 claimants to the throne came forward. Those with the most credible claims were John Balliol; Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale (also spelled &quot;Bruce&quot;); John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings; and Floris V, Count of Holland.

Fearing civil war, the Guardians of Scotland asked Edward I of England to arbitrate. Before agreeing, he obtained concessions going some way to revive English overlordship over the Scots. A commission of 104 &quot;auditors&quot; was then appointed—24 by Edward himself, acting as president; and the rest by Brus and Balliol, in equal numbers. In November 1292, the body decided in favour of John Balliol, whose claim was based on the traditional criterion of primogeniture—inheritance through a line of firstborn sons. The decision was accepted by the majority of the powerful in Scotland, and John ruled as King of Scots from then until 1296, when he was succeeded by Robert de Brus, another claimant.

==Background==
With the death of King Alexander III in 1286, the crown of Scotland passed to his only surviving descendant, his three-year-old granddaughter Margaret (the Maid of Norway). In 1290, the Guardians of Scotland, who had been appointed to govern the realm during the young Queen&#x27;s minority, drew up the Treaty of Birgham, a marriage contract between Margaret and the five-year-old Edward of Caernarfon, heir apparent to the English throne. The treaty, amongst other points, contained the provision that although the issue of this marriage would inherit the crowns of both England and Scotland, the latter kingdom should be &quot;separate, apart and free in itself without subjection to the English Kingdom&quot;. The intent was to keep Scotland an independent entity.

Margaret died on 26 September 1290 in Orkney on her way to Scotland, leaving the throne vacant. The Guardians called upon her fiancé&#x27;s father, Edward I of England, to conduct a court in which 104 auditors would choose from among the various claimants of the Scottish throne in a process known as the Great Cause (). One of the strongest claimants, John Balliol, Lord of Galloway, forged an alliance with the powerful Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, the representative of Edward I in Scotland, and began styling himself &#x27;heir of Scotland&#x27;, while another, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, turned up at the site of Margaret&#x27;s supposed inauguration with a force of soldiers amidst rumours that his friends the Earl of Mar and the Earl of Atholl were also raising their forces. Scotland looked to be headed for civil war.

== Edward I steps in ==
To avoid the catastrophe of open warfare between Brus and Balliol, the Guardians and other Scots magnates asked Edward I to intervene. Edward seized the occasion as an opportunity to gain something he had long desired—legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England. The English kings had a long history of presuming an overlordship of Scotland, harking back to the late 12th century when Scotland had actually been a vassal state of Henry II&#x27;s England for 15 years from 1174 (Treaty of Falaise) until the Quitclaim of Canterbury (1189), but the legality of Edward&#x27;s 13th-century claim was questionable. Alexander III, giving homage to Edward, had chosen his words very carefully: &quot;I become your man for the lands I hold of you in the Kingdom of England for which I owe homage, &quot;saving my Kingdom&quot;&quot; (author&#x27;s italics).

In line with this desire, Edward demanded in May 1291 that his claim of feudal overlordship of Scotland be recognised before he would step in and act as arbiter. He demanded that the Scots produce evidence to show that he was not the lawful overlord, rather than presenting them with evidence that he was. The Scots&#x27; reply came that without a king there was no one in the realm responsible enough to possibly make such an admission, and so any assurances given by the Scots were worthless. Although technically and legally correct by the standards of the time, this reply infuriated Edward so much that he refused to have it entered on the official record of the proceedings.

The Guardians and the claimants still needed Edward&#x27;s help, and he did manage to press them into accepting a number of lesser though still important terms. The majority of the claimants and the Guardians did eventually step forward to acknowledge Edward as their rightful overlord, even though they could not be taken as speaking for the realm as a whole. They also agreed to put Edward in temporary control of the principal royal castles of Scotland, despite the castles in question not being theirs to give away. For his part, Edward agreed that he would return control of both kingdom and castles to the successful claimant within two months. In the ongoing negotiations between the two countries, the Scots continued to use the Treaty of Birgham as a reference point, indicating that they still wished to see Scotland retain an identity independent from England.

These concessions obtained, Edward arranged for a court to decide which of the claimants should inherit the throne. It consisted of 104 auditors plus Edward himself as president. Edward chose 24 of the auditors while the two claimants with the strongest cases—Brus and Balliol—were allowed to appoint forty each.

== Claimants ==

When Margaret died, there were no close relatives to whom the succession might pass in a smooth and clear manner. Of her nearest relatives derived through legitimate descent from prior kings, all but one were the descendants of Margaret&#x27;s great-great-great-grandfather, Henry, the son of king David I of Scotland; the exception was Edward I himself, who was a descendant of Malcolm Canmore&#x27;s daughter Matilda of Scotland. In addition to these relatives, there were noblemen descended from illegitimate daughters of more recent Scottish kings who also made claims. Thirteen nobles put themselves forward as candidates for the throne (with those claiming the throne through illegitimate lines in &quot;italic&quot;):

*John Balliol, Lord of Galloway, son of Devorguilla, daughter of Margaret, eldest daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon, son of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon, son of King David I. He pleaded primogeniture in legitimate, cognatic line.
*Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, son of Isabella, second daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon. He was regent of Scotland sometime during the minority of King Alexander III and was occasionally recognised as a tanist of the Scottish throne. In the succession dispute, he pleaded tanistry and proximity in degree of kinship to the previous monarch, his descent being a generation shorter.
*John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, son of Henry de Hastings, son of Ada, third daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon.
*Floris V, Count of Holland, son of William II, Count of Holland, son of Floris IV, Count of Holland, son of William I, Count of Holland, son of Ada, daughter of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon. He claimed that David, Earl of Huntingdon, had renounced his hereditary rights to throne of Scotland.
*John &quot;the Black&quot; Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, son of John Comyn, son of Richard Comyn, son of William Comyn, son of Hextilda, daughter of Bethóc, daughter of King Donald III.
*&quot;Nicholas de Soules&quot;, son of Ermengarde, daughter of Marjorie, natural daughter of King Alexander II.
*&quot;Patrick Galithly&quot;, son of Henry Galithly, natural son of King William the Lion.
*&quot;William de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros&quot;, son of Robert de Ros, son of William de Ros of Hamlake, son of Isabella, natural daughter of King William the Lion.
*&quot;William de Vesci, Baron de Vesci&quot;, son of William de Vesci, son of Margaret, illegitimate daughter of King William the Lion.
*&quot;Patrick Dunbar, 7th Earl of Dunbar&quot;, son of Patrick, 6th Earl of Dunbar, son of Patrick, 5th Earl of Dunbar, son of Ada, natural daughter of King William the Lion.
*&quot;Roger de Mandeville&quot;, son of Agatha, daughter of Aufrica, an alleged natural daughter of William de Say, son of Aufrica, an alleged natural daughter of King William the Lion.
*&quot;Robert de Pinkeney&quot;, son of Henry, son of Alicia, daughter of Marjorie, an alleged natural daughter of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon.
*Eric II, King of Norway, father of Queen Margaret and son-in-law of King Alexander III.

== Claims ==
In reality only four of these men had genuine claims to the throne: John Hastings, John Balliol, Robert de Brus and Floris V. Of these only Brus and Balliol had realistic grounds on which to claim the crown. The rest merely wished to have their claims put on the legal record.

John Hastings, an Englishman with extensive estates in Scotland, could not succeed to the throne by any of the normal rules governing feudal legacy; instead his lawyers argued that Scotland was not a true kingdom at all, based, amongst other things, on the tradition that Scots kings were neither crowned nor anointed. As such, by the normal rules of feudal or customary law the kingdom should be split amongst the direct descendants of the co-heiresses of David I. Unsurprisingly, a court made up of Scots nobles rejected these arguments out of hand.

John Balliol had the simplest, and thus, by some measure, the strongest claim of the four. By the tradition of primogeniture, he was the rightful claimant (his mother Devorguilla of Galloway had been the eldest surviving child of Margaret of Huntingdon, Lady of Galloway, herself the eldest daughter of Earl David of Huntingdon); and that tradition had become steadily entrenched in customary inheritance law both in England and Scotland over the preceding two centuries. Balliol also argued that the Kingdom of Scotland was, as a royal estate, indivisible as an entity. This was necessary to prevent the kingdom being split equally amongst the heirs, as Hastings argued.

Robert de Brus, Lord of Annandale, had the best claim to the throne according to proximity of blood. As such, his arguments centred on this being a more suitable way to govern the succession than primogeniture. His lawyers suggested that this had been the case in most successions and as such had become something of a &quot;natural law&quot;. They also put before the court the suggestion that Alexander III had designated Brus as heir when he himself was still childless. Finally, his lawyers argued that the concept of primogeniture would only be relevant if customary law applied. Strict customary law, they said, would validate Hastings&#x27; argument, and require the kingdom to be split; if the kingdom was indivisible, customary law (including primogeniture) could not apply. Whatever the rationale for Brus&#x27;s earlier nomination as heir, however, it was not considered conclusive evidence of which tradition was being followed, because at that time Devorguilla had no sons, and so Brus would have also qualified as heir by male-preference primogeniture. As for any apparent contradiction between accepting primogeniture and rejecting partition, Edward I was unsympathetic to the argument, having himself drawn up plans for England to be inherited by his eldest daughter, should he die without sons. In November 1292, therefore, Edward ruled that customary law and primogeniture rather than proximity of blood should be used to determine the rightful heir.

Floris V&#x27;s argument was that during the reign of William the Lion the king&#x27;s brother David, Earl of Huntingdon had resigned the right of himself and his heirs to the throne in exchange for a grant of land in Aberdeenshire. If true, this would rule out the first three claimants, all heirs of Earl David, and give Floris the strongest claim to the throne. Floris claimed that although he did not possess copies of the documents detailing the handover of power, one must exist somewhere in Scotland, and Edward adjourned the court for a full ten months while a search was made through various castle treasuries. No such copy was found, and Floris withdrew his claim in the summer of 1292. In November 1292, following the rejection of Brus&#x27;s claim, Floris then put forward his claim for a second time—this time with Brus as his backer. There is evidence that he had already entered into an agreement with Brus at the time of withdrawing his claim, in which if one of them was to successfully claim the throne, he would grant the other one third of the kingdom as a feudal fief, and Brus may have hoped that pressing Floris&#x27;s candidacy for a second time might not only put Floris on the throne but give Brus a substantial consolation prize. However, Floris&#x27;s case was this time rejected for lack of evidence: despite the long interval since his earlier request for an adjournment, he was unable to produce evidence of his claim—due, he claimed, to theft of the vital documents. His claim was this time thrown out for lack of evidence. Copies of the documents he sought would later surface at Pluscarden. One of the early &quot;certified copies&quot;, dating the certification seals of the bishop of Moray and the prior of Pluscarden to 1291, is currently located in The Hague. This document is thought to be a forgery.

Finally, in the closing days of the Great Cause, Brus did an about-turn on the matter of the divisibility of the kingdom. He had previously argued that the kingdom was indivisible; now, in view of Edward&#x27;s ruling that customary law applied, Brus joined his arguments to those of Hastings, and argued that if customary law applied, the kingdom &quot;was&quot; divisible after all, and should be divided up between the heirs of Earl David&#x27;s three daughters. This argument was swiftly rejected, and a verdict given in favour of Balliol as rightful king.

== Election ==
Edward delivered the judgement of the jurors on the Scottish case on 17 November 1292 in favour of John Balliol, with his son Edward Balliol becoming heir designate. This decision had the support of the majority of Scots nobles and magnates, even a number of those appointed by Brus as auditors. Of special note was the support of John II Comyn, another claimant and head of the most powerful baronial family in Scotland, who was married to Balliol&#x27;s sister, Eleanor. In later years the Comyn family remained staunch supporters of the Balliol claim to the throne.

<doc id="1130059" wikidata="Q5354619" url="?curid=1130059" title="Elections in Argentina">
<text>At the national level, Argentina elects a head of state (the President) and a legislature. The franchise extends to all citizens aged 16 and over, and voting is mandatory (with a few exceptions) for all those who are between 18 and 70 years of age.

The President and the Vice President are elected in one ballot, for a four-year term, by direct popular vote, using a runoff voting system: a second vote is held if no party wins more than 45% of the votes, or more than 40% with also at least 10 percentage points more than the runner-up. Before the 1995 election, the president and vice-president were both elected by an electoral college.

The National Congress (&quot;Congreso de la Nación&quot;) has two chambers. The Chamber of Deputies of the Nation (&quot;Cámara de Diputados de la Nación&quot;) has 257 members, elected for a four-year term in each electoral district (23 Provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) by proportional representation using the D&#x27;Hondt method, with half of the seats renewed every two years in all districts. The Senate of the Nation (&quot;Senado de la Nación&quot;) has 72 members, elected for a six-year term in three-seat constituencies (23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires) for a six-year term, with two seats awarded to the largest party or coalition and one seat to the second largest party or coalition. One-third of the constituencies are renewed every two years. In 2001 the whole senate was renewed. A gender parity law, adopted in 2017, mandates that party lists must alternate between male and female candidates.

==History==

Universal, secret and compulsory voting for male Argentine citizens, either natural-born or naturalized, was guaranteed by the 1912 Sáenz Peña Law, named after President Roque Sáenz Peña. The first free elections under the Sáenz Peña regime were held in 1916. Women did not have the right to vote in Argentina until 1947, when Law 13.010 (&quot;on political rights for women&quot;) was sanctioned during the government of Juan Domingo Perón. Women first voted in a national election in 1951.

Throughout the 20th century, voting was suppressed by Argentina&#x27;s numerous dictatorial regimes. The dictatorships of José Félix Uriburu (1930–1932) and the so-called &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; and &quot;Revolución Argentina&quot;, as well as the last military dictatorship (1976–1983), all suppressed voting altogether. In addition, electoral fraud was widespread under the successive governments of the so-called &quot;Infamous Decade&quot;. Since the return of democracy in 1983, Argentine elections have been generally deemed as free, fair and transparent, and participation levels remain high, with an average of 70.24% as of 2019.

In 2012, Law 26.774 (&quot;on Argentine Citizenship&quot;) lowered the legal voting age for Argentine citizens from 18 to 16, making Argentina one of twelve countries in the world to do so.

==Eligibility to vote==

The right to vote is mandated in Article 37 of the Constitution of Argentina, and further detailed in the National Electoral Code. In the national order, entitlement to vote is based on citizenship. Natural-born Argentine citizens and citizens by descent aged 16 or older have the right to vote, while naturalized citizens may vote from the age of 18 (see Argentine nationality law). Non-citizen permanent residents do not have the right to vote for national offices, but may be allowed to vote for local office as established by provincial law. The right to vote is not extended to:
*the mentally unfit (as demonstrated in trial), 
*those who have been convicted of crimes with intent, 
*those who have been convicted of illegal gambling (for three years only, and for six years in cases of recidivism), 
*those who have been sanctioned for qualified desertion,
*those who have been declared to be rebels in a criminal cause, until the cessation of said rebellion, or until prescription,
*those who are limited by the dispositions on the Organic Law on Political Parties,
*those who have otherwise been declared unable to exercise their political rights.

All Argentine citizens are automatically registered to vote in the national electoral roll, which is updated on a bi-yearly basis ahead of every scheduled election. From the ages of 18 to 70, voting is compulsory. Eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 70 may by exempt from voting if they are:
*sitting judges and their auxiliaries who must remain in their offices for the duration of the electoral act,
*over 500 kilometers away from their designated voting place, and can justify that distance with reason through a certificate written by their closest police authority,
*ill or otherwise unable, with sufficient proof, as demonstrated by a doctor in the national, provincial, or municipal health services, or by private doctors if all the aforementioned are not available.

Argentine citizens living abroad may vote in embassies and consulates of Argentina.

==Provincial elections==
Provincial law and constitutions, controlled by provincial legislatures regulate elections at the provincial level and local level. Since the separation of powers applies to provinces as well as the federal government, provincial legislatures and the executive (the governor) are elected separately. Governors are elected in all provinces.

All members of provincial legislatures and territorial jurisdiction legislature are elected.

As a matter of convenience and cost-saving, elections for many of these provincial and local offices are held at the same time as the federal presidential elections. There is a handful of provinces, however, that instead hold their elections separately.

<text>MeNZB was a vaccine against a specific strain of group B meningococcus, used to control an epidemic of meningococcal disease in New Zealand. Most people are able to carry the meningococcus bacteria safely with no ill effects. However, meningococcal disease can cause meningitis and sepsis, resulting in brain damage, failure of various organs, severe skin and soft-tissue damage, and death.

Immunisation with MeNZB requires three doses, administered approximately six weeks apart (except in newborns, who have them in conjunction with their 6-week, 3-month and 5-month injections). People who have been fully immunised may still carry the meningococcus bacteria and may still contract meningococcal disease.

==Components==
Each dose is 0.5 ml and contains:

*25 mcg of outer membrane vesicles from the &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; group B strain NZ98/254. The vaccine does not contain any whole bacteria (alive or dead). The &quot;outer membrane vesicles&quot; it contains are a small part of the &quot;skin&quot; of the bacteria that let the immune system recognise and prepare for being infected with the real thing. MeNZB vaccine does not contain any human, blood, or bovine (cow) products, egg products, neomycin or the preservative thiomersal (mercury). There are no live meningococcal bacteria in the vaccine and it is not possible to catch the disease or become a carrier of the disease from the vaccine.
*1.65 mg of aluminium hydroxide (an adjuvant). The immune system will normally not mount an immune response to the outer membrane vesicles if they are presented alone. The presence of the adjuvant forces the immune system to respond to the membrane vesicles by acting to prevent their breakdown and elimination, while causing local tissue damage to provoke the desired immune reaction.
*histidine (to stabilise the pH). The histidine pH buffer is to ensure the vaccine stays as close as possible to the pH of human body fluids. This is to ensure the immune system does not waste time trying to neutralise the vaccine instead of responding to the outer membrane vesicles.
*normal saline. The saline (sterile salt and water) is also like packaging. It is required so that all of the above can be dissolved into a solution that can be injected. It is the same salinity (saltiness) as normal human body fluid.

The antigen in MeNZB is prepared from B:4:P1.7b,4 (NZ 98/254 ) &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; strain, grown in a fermentor. The bacteria are grown in a synthetic culture medium containing sugar, essential amino acids and essential elements such as iron and potassium. The fermentation does not use bovine or porcine products. The cellular outer membranes are extracted with the detergent deoxycholate, which kills the bacteria. Outer membrane vesicles are purified out of the culture medium by ultracentrifugation, stabilised by histidine and then adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide Al(OH)3 as an adjuvant. Purification is achieved by ultrafiltration/diafiltration.

==Impact==
Since its introduction in 2004 the vaccine has had a dramatic impact on the meningitis epidemic began in 1991. Between 2004 and 2006 New Zealand offered free MeNZB vaccination to anyone under the age of 20. Routine immunisation for babies and preschoolers continued until June 2008. The last phase of this programme, immunisation for people with a high medical risk, ended in March 2011. Reasons given for this halt of the programme include that the epidemic was coming to an end, and that immune protection given by the vaccine is only short-term. The primary analysis estimated MeNZB to have an effectiveness of 77% after 3 doses and a mean follow-up time of 3.2 years.

As &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; and &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; are closely related bacteria and have 80–90% homology in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by meningococcal vaccines against &quot;N. gonorrhoeae&quot; infections is plausible. A study published in 2017 showed that MeNZB vaccine provided a partial protection against Gonorrhea. The vaccine efficiency was calculated to be 31%.

<doc id="1130097" wikidata="Q4356867" url="?curid=1130097" title="Inflationary epoch">
<text>In physical cosmology, the inflationary epoch was the period in the evolution of the early universe when, according to inflation theory, the universe underwent an extremely rapid exponential expansion. This rapid expansion increased the linear dimensions of the early universe by a factor of at least 1026 (and possibly a much larger factor), and so increased its volume by a factor of at least 1078. Expansion by a factor of 1026 is equivalent to expanding an object 1 nanometer (10−9 m, about half the width of a molecule of DNA) in length to one approximately 10.6 light years (about 62 trillion miles).

==Description==

Vacuum state is a configuration of quantum fields representing a local minimum (but not necessarily a global minimum) of energy.

Inflationary models propose that at approximately 10−36 seconds after the Big Bang, vacuum state of the Universe was different from the one seen at the present time: the inflationary vacuum had a much higher energy density.

According to general relativity, any vacuum state with non-zero energy density generates a repulsive force that leads to an expansion of space. In inflationary models, early high-energy vacuum state causes a very rapid expansion. This expansion explains various properties of the current universe that are difficult to account for without such an inflationary epoch.

Most inflationary models propose a scalar field called the inflaton field, with properties necessary for having (at least) two vacuum states.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds after the Big Bang. The rapid expansion of space meant that any potential elementary particles (or other &quot;unwanted&quot; artifacts, such as topological defects) remaining from the time before inflation were now distributed very thinly across the universe.

When the inflaton field reconfigured itself into the low-energy vacuum state we currently observe, the huge difference in potential energy was released in the form of a dense, hot mixture of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons as it entered the electroweak epoch.

<doc id="1130104" wikidata="Q3586350" url="?curid=1130104" title="1982 New Brunswick general election">
<text>The 1982 New Brunswick general election was held on October 12, 1982, to elect 58 members to the 50th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly, the governing house of the province of New Brunswick, Canada. It saw Richard Hatfield&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party win its largest majority ever to that time. (Bernard Lord beat this record in 1999.)

==Background==
The Opposition Liberal Party had changed leaders four times since the eve of the 1978 election. It chose Doug Young just months before the vote in a divisive contest that came down to a final ballot against Joseph A. Day.

==Campaign==
The PCs ran two separate campaigns - one in English and one in French. The francophone campaign, which was mostly run by Hatfield&#x27;s French lieutenant Jean-Maurice Simard, began with the Grand Ralliement, a symposium on language rights which took place in Shippagan ten days before the election call. Over 400 notable Acadians and other francophones attended. The dual campaigns were remarkably separate from each other, and in some cases contradictory: the English campaign revolved around attacking Doug Young&#x27;s economic record, while the French campaign pointed out Hatfield&#x27;s role working with Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in enshrining francophone rights in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Liberals, divided by their recent leadership contest, ran a lackluster campaign which allowed Hatfield&#x27;s and Simard&#x27;s overtures to the Acadian population to carry many seats that had been Liberal strongholds for generations, including 10 of 21 Acadian ridings. The Parti Acadien made its last appearance, as the Conservatives adopted several key points of their former platform.

The New Democratic Party of New Brunswick elected Bob Hall as its first ever Member of the Legislative Assembly. He was later joined by a second NDP MLA, Peter Trites, in a by-election.

<doc id="1130106" wikidata="Q1459861" url="?curid=1130106" title="Cuban dissident movement">
<text>The Cuban dissident movement is a political movement in Cuba whose aim is to replace the current government with a liberal democracy. According to Human Rights Watch, the Marxist-Leninist Cuban government represses nearly all forms of political dissent.

Some dissident groups in the Cuban diaspora received both funding and assistance from the U.S. Intelligence Community during the Cold War, which has caused the Communist Party of Cuba to allege that all dissidents are part of a United States strategy to covertly destabilize the Party&#x27;s control over the country.

==Background==
===1959 Cuban Revolution===
Fidel Castro came to power with the Cuban Revolution of 1959. By the end of 1960, according to Paul H. Lewis in &quot;Authoritarian Regimes in Latin America&quot;, all opposition newspapers had been closed down and all radio and television stations were under state control.

Homosexuals as well as other &quot;deviant&quot; groups who were excluded from military conscription, were forced to conduct their compulsory military service in work camps called &quot;Military Units to Aid Production&quot; in the 1960s, and were subjected to political &quot;reeducation&quot;. Some of Castro&#x27;s military commanders brutalized the inmates.

In nearly all areas of government, loyalty to the regime became the primary criterion for all appointments.

====Government authority====
* The media is operated under the Cuban Communist Party’s Department of Revolutionary Orientation, which &quot;develops and coordinates propaganda strategies&quot;.
* A Human Rights Watch 1999 report on Cuba notes that Cuba has penalties for anyone who &quot;threatens, libels or slanders, defames, affronts (injuria) or in any other way insults (ultraje) or offends, with the spoken word or in writing, the dignity or decorum of an authority, public functionary, or his agents or auxiliaries&quot;. There are even harsher penalties for those who show contempt for the President of the Council of the State, the President of the National Assembly of Popular Power, the members of the Council of the State or the Council of Ministers, or the Deputies of the National Assembly of the Popular Power.
* There is a three-month to one-year sentence for anyone who &quot;publicly defames, denigrates, or scorns the Republic&#x27;s institutions, the political, mass, or social organizations of the country, or the heroes or martyrs of the nation&quot;.
* Cubans are not allowed to produce, distribute or store publications without informing the authorities.
* Social dangerousness, defined as violations of &quot;socialist morality&quot;, can warrant &quot;pre-criminal measures&quot; and &quot;therapeutic measures&quot;.
* Regarding institutions, the Human Rights Watch report notes that the Interior Ministry has principal responsibility for monitoring the Cuban population for signs of dissent.
* In 1991, two new mechanisms for internal surveillance and control emerged. Communist Party leaders organized the Singular Systems of Vigilance and Protection (Sistema Unico de Vigilancia y Protección, SUVP). Rapid Action Brigades (Brigadas de Acción Rapida, also referred to as Rapid Response Brigades, or Brigadas de Respuesta Rápida) observe and control dissidents. The regime also &quot;maintains academic and labor files (expedientes escolares y laborales) for each citizen, in which officials record actions or statements that may bear on the person&#x27;s loyalty to the regime. Before advancing to a new school or position, the individual&#x27;s record must first be deemed acceptable&quot;.

===Situation today===

In 2017, Cuba was described as one of only two &quot;authoritarian regimes&quot; in the Americas by &quot;The Economist&quot;&#x27;s 2017 Democracy Index. The island had the second highest number of imprisoned journalists in the world in 2008, second only to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an international press organization.
The military of Cuba is a central organization; it controls 60 percent of the economy and is Raúl Castro&#x27;s base.

According to a paper published in the &quot;Harvard International Review&quot;, dissident groups are weak and infiltrated by Cuban state security. Media is totally state-controlled. Dissidents find it difficult to organize and &quot;Many of their leaders have shown enormous courage in defying the regime. Yet, time and again, the security apparatus has discredited or destroyed them. They do not represent a major threat to the regime.&quot;

The paper &quot;Can Cuba Change?&quot; in the National Endowment for Democracy&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Democracy&quot; states that about nine-tenths of the populace forms an economically and politically oppressed underclass and &quot;Using the principles of democracy and human rights to unite and mobilize this vast, dispossessed majority in the face of a highly repressive regime is the key to peaceful change&quot;. Working people are a critical source of discontent. The only legal trade union is controlled by the government and strikes are banned. Afro-Cuban dissidents have also risen, fueled by racism in Cuba.

In 2012, Amnesty International warned that repression of Cuban dissidents was on the rise over the past two years, citing the Wilmar Villar hunger strike death, as well as the arrests of prisoners of conscience Yasmin Conyedo Riveron, Yusmani Rafael Alvarez Esmori, and Antonio Michel and Marcos Máiquel Lima Cruz. The Cuban Commission of Human Rights reported that there were 6,602 detentions of government opponents in 2012, up from 4,123 in 2011.

==Dissident groups==
There are a number of opposition parties and groups that campaign for political change in Cuba. Though amendments to the Cuban Constitution of 1992 decriminalized the right to form political parties other than the Communist Party of Cuba, these parties are not permitted to engage in public political activities on the island.

* Alpha 66, a paramilitary founded by Cuban exiles
* Center for a Free Cuba, based in the United States and supported by the US government.
* Christian Liberation Movement, a movement and group of Catholics that was founded by Oswaldo Payá. They are notable for starting the Varela Project.
* Cuban Democratic Directorate, a non-governmental organization aligned with the Centrist Democrat International and International Democratic Union.
* Ladies in White received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament in 2005.
* Lawton Foundation, an organization to promote the &quot;study, defense, and denunciation of human rights inside Cuba&quot;. The group was formed by Oscar Elías Biscet.
* Omega 7, a small terrorist group that operated against the Cuban government from the 1960s to the 1980s.
* Patriotic Union of Cuba – Founded by José Daniel Ferrer, a former member of the Christian Liberation Movement, it has defined itself as a civic organization that advocates for a peaceful but firm fight against any repression of civil liberties in the Republic of Cuba.
* Rosa Parks Feminist Movement for Civil Rights
* San Isidro Movement, a group of writers, artists, academics and journalists protesting restriction on freedom of expression, beginning in 2018.
* Yo No Coopero Con La Dictadura (), a civil resistance organization.
* Assembly of the Cuban Resistance

==Dissidents==
===Black Spring===
During the &quot;Black Spring&quot; in 2003, the regime imprisoned 75 dissidents, including 29 journalists. Their cases were reviewed by Amnesty International who officially adopted them as prisoners of conscience. To the original list of 75 prisoners of conscience resulting from the wave of arrests in spring 2003, Amnesty International added four more dissidents in January 2004. They had been arrested in the same context as the other 75 but did not receive their sentences until much later. These prisoners have since been released in the face of international pressure. Tripartite talks between the Cuban government, the Catholic Church in Cuba and the Spanish government were initiated in spring 2010 in reaction to the controversial death of political prisoner Orlando Zapata Tamayo in February 2010 following a hunger strike amid reports of massive abuse at the hands of prison staff. These negotiations resulted in a July 2010 agreement that all remaining prisoners of the &#x27;Group of 75&#x27; would be freed. Spain offered to receive those prisoners who would agree to be released and immediately exiled together with their families. Of the 79 prisoners of conscience 56 were still behind bars at the time of the agreement. Of the total group, 21 are still living in Cuba today whereas the others are in exile, most of them in Spain. The final two prisoners were released on 23 March 2011.

===Notable people===

* Manuel Vázquez Portal, a poet, writer, and a journalist, received the 2003 CPJ International Press Freedom Award.
* Héctor Maseda Gutiérrez, a jailed nuclear engineer and journalist, received the 2008 CPJ International Press Freedom Award.
* Jorge Luis García Pérez (known as Antúnez) was jailed for criticizing communism and spent 17 years in jail until released in 2007. As the longest-serving jailed black dissident when he was released, he has been referred to as Cuba&#x27;s Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mendela, on the other hand, was an outspoken supporter of the Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro, crediting him with the liberation of his country.
* Canek Sánchez Guevara, grandson of Che Guevara
*Jorge Mas Canosa (1939–1997), founder of the Cuban American National Foundation
*Jesús Permuy, human rights activist, founder of the Human Rights Center of Miami
* Gorki Águila, musician 
* Jose Luis Llovio-Menendez, bureaucrat, defected in 1981.
* Rafael del Pino Díaz, Brigadier General. Highest government official to have defected so far, in 1987

==Independent bloggers==

The Foreign Policy magazine named Yoani Sánchez one of the &quot;10 Most Influential Intellectuals of Latin America&quot;, the only woman on the list. An article in &quot;El Nuevo Herald&quot; by Ivette Leyva Martinez, speaks to the role played by Yoani Sanchez and other young people, outside the Cuban opposition and dissidence movements, in working towards a free and democratic Cuba today:

On 29 March 2009, at Tania Bruguera&#x27;s performance where a podium with an open mic was staged for people to have one minute of uncensored public speech, Sánchez was among people to publicly criticize censorship in Cuba and said that &quot;the time has come to jump over the wall of control&quot;. The government condemned the event. Sánchez was then placed under surveillance by the Cuban police.

==June 2010 letter to United States Congress==
On Thursday, 10 June 2010, seventy-four of Cuba&#x27;s dissidents signed a letter to the United States Congress in support of a bill that would lift the US travel ban for Americans wishing to visit Cuba. The signers include blogger Yoani Sanchez and hunger striker Guillermo Farinas, as well as Elizardo Sanchez, head of Cuba&#x27;s most prominent human rights group and Miriam Leiva, who helped found the Damas de Blanco, or Ladies in White, a group of wives and mothers of jailed dissidents. The letter supports a bill introduced on 23 February by Rep. Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat, that would bar the president from prohibiting travel to Cuba or blocking transactions required to make such trips. It also would bar the White House from stopping direct transfers between US and Cuban banks. The signers stated that:

We share the opinion that the isolation of the people of Cuba benefits the most inflexible interests of its government, while any opening serves to inform and empower the Cuban people and helps to further strengthen our civil society.
The Center for Democracy in the Americas, a Washington-based group supporting the bill, issued a press release stating that &quot;74 of Cuba&#x27;s most prominent political dissidents have endorsed the Peterson-Moran legislation to end the travel ban and expand food exports to Cuba because in their words it is good for human rights, good for alleviating hunger, and good for spreading information and showing solidarity with the Cuban people. Their letter answers every argument the pro-embargo forces use to oppose this legislation. This, itself, answers the question &#x27;who is speaking for the Cuban people in this debate?&#x27; - those who want to send food and Americans to visit the island and stand with ordinary Cubans, or those who don&#x27;t. If Cuba&#x27;s best known bloggers, dissidents, hunger strikers, and other activists for human rights want this legislation enacted, what else needs be said?&quot; The Center also hosts English as well as the Spanish version of the letter signed by the 74 dissidents.

==Hunger strikes==
On 3 April 1972, Pedro Luis Boitel, an imprisoned poet and dissident, declared himself on hunger strike. After 53 days on hunger strike without receiving medical assistance and receiving only liquids, he died of starvation on 25 May 1972. His last days were related by his close friend, poet Armando Valladares. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cólon Cemetery in Havana.

Guillermo Fariñas did a seven-month hunger strike to protest against the extensive Internet censorship in Cuba. He ended it in autumn 2006 with severe health problems, although still conscious. Reporters Without Borders awarded its cyber-freedom prize to Fariñas in 2006.

Jorge Luis García Pérez (known as Antúnez) has done hunger strikes. In 2009, following the end of his 17-year imprisonment, Antúnez, his wife Iris, and Diosiris Santana Pérez started a hunger strike to support other political prisoners. Leaders from Uruguay, Costa Rica, and Argentina declared their support for Antúnez.

Orlando Zapata Tamayo, an imprisoned activist and dissident, died while on a hunger strike for more than 80 days. Zapata went on the strike in protest against the Cuban government for having denied him the choice of wearing white dissident clothes instead of the designated prisoner uniform, as well as denouncing the living conditions of other prisoners. As part of his claim, Zapata was asking for the prisoners conditions to be comparable to those that Fidel Castro had while incarcerated after his 1953 attack against the Moncada Barracks.

In 2012, Wilmar Villar Mendoza died after a 50+ day hunger strike.

==Cuban exiles==

More than one million Cubans of all social classes have left the island to the United States, and to Spain, the UK, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and other countries.

== Funding ==
Cuban dissident groups have received millions in funding from the USA government and are considered by the Cuban government to be part of the United States strategy for Cuba to destabilize the country.

Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio told Reuters in 2022:&quot;In any nation, [having people who act as foreign government agents] is illegal, That is precisely what the United States is trying to promote in Cuba today .

[The U.S.A is] depressing the standard of living of the population and at the same time pouring millions of US taxpayer dollars into urging people to act against the [Cuban] government,&quot;

<doc id="1130115" wikidata="Q5219160" url="?curid=1130115" title="Daniel al-Kumisi">
<text>Daniel al-Kumisi (? in Damagan, Tabaristan – 946, in Jerusalem) was one of the most prominent early scholars of Karaite Judaism. He flourished at the end of the ninth or the beginning of the tenth century. He was a native of Damagan, capital of the province of Qumis in the former state of Tabaristan (now in Semnan province of Iran), as is shown by his two surnames, the latter of which is found only in Jacob Qirqisani&#x27;s works.

Al-Kumisi&#x27;s attitude to Anan ben David and his violent opposition to the Ananites (i.e., the first Karaites, Anan&#x27;s followers and immediate successors) are characteristic of his place in Karaism. At first, he esteemed Anan highly, calling him &quot;rosh hamaskilim&quot; &quot;chief of the scholars&quot;. However, he later despised him and called him &quot;rosh hakesilim&quot; &quot;chief of the fools&quot;. Nevertheless, Daniel&#x27;s opinions were respected by the Karaites.

Daniel later immigrated to Jerusalem, and founded the order of the &quot;Mourners of Zion.&quot; He may have built the oldest Karaite synagogue, which is located in Jerusalem. Espousing proto-Zionist views, he urged his fellow Karaites to return to Israel, and called those who opposed doing so &quot;fools who draw the Lord&#x27;s wrath&quot; in his &quot;Epistle to the Diaspora&quot;.

As regards Daniel&#x27;s theories, he denied that speculation could be regarded as a source of knowledge, and, probably following this tenet, he maintained, in opposition to Anan, the principle that the Biblical laws must not be interpreted allegorically nor explained contrary to the simple text (see below). He evinces little regard for science; for instance, he asserted it is forbidden to determine the new moon by calculation after the manner of the Rabbanites because such calculations are condemned like astrology. This practise is threatened with severe punishment in Isaiah 47, 13–14. Nonetheless, Daniel in his commentary to Leviticus 26, indulges in long reflections on the theodicy and the suffering of the pious. His conception of the angels, also, is most extraordinary. He says that wherever &quot;mal&#x27;akhim&quot; &quot;angels&quot; are mentioned in the Bible, the designation does not refer to living, speaking beings who act as messengers, but to forces of nature, as fire, fog, winds, etc. through which God performs His works (compare Maimonides, &quot;Moreh,&quot; ii. 6). This may be due to the influence of the Sadducees, who also denied the existence of angels; compare Acts of the Apostles 23, 8, as in works circulated among the earlier Karaites named after Zadok and containing Sadducee opinions.

==Legal Decisions==
Daniel favored a rigorous interpretation of the Torah. The following decisions of his have been preserved: It is forbidden to do any work whatever on Shabbat—even to clean the hands with powder—or to have any work done on the Sabbath by a non-Jew, whether gratuitously, or for wages or any other compensation. The burning of lights is forbidden not only on Friday evenings, but also on the evenings of the festivals. In the description in Lev. xxiii. 40 of the trees which, according to Daniel, were used in erecting the sukkah, the phrase &quot;periez hadar&quot; (the fruit of goodly trees) is more definitely explained by &quot;kappot temarim&quot; (branches of palms), the palm being distinguished for its beauty (Cant. vii. 8).

Like Anan, Benjamin Nahawandi and Ismāʿīl al-ʿUkbarī, Daniel forbade eating animals used for sacrifice in the Temple of Jerusalem in the Diaspora, adding to the proofs of his predecessors others drawn from Hosea 9, 4 and Isa. lxvi. 3. The prohibition contained in Exodus 23, 19 (&quot;You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk&quot;) must not be interpreted allegorically, as Anan interpreted it, but literally. The priest carried out the injunction to &quot;pinch off its head&quot; of the bird (Book of Leviticus 1, 15: ) by cutting the head off entirely, after the slaughtering. The clean birds are not recognizable by certain signs, as Rabbanites assert, but the names of the birds as found in the Torah are decisive; since these can not always be identified, Karaites made the class of forbidden birds very large.

Among locusts, only the four species expressly named in Lev. xi. 22 are permitted as food. It is forbidden to eat eggs because they must be considered as living things that can not be slaughtered according to the Book of Deuteronomy 22, 6–7, where it is permitted to take the young but not the eggs. Of fish, only the eggs are permitted; blood is forbidden.

The leper must still be considered unclean; this was directed against Anan, who had held that the laws regarding the clean and the unclean were not applicable in the Diaspora. The carcass of an animal, however, ceases to be unclean after use has been made of it in any way, as is proved by Leviticus 7, 24.

==Influence of Islam and Talmud==
Concerning levirate marriage, Daniel agrees with Anan that &quot;ahim&quot; in Deuteronomy 25, 5 does not mean &quot;brothers&quot;, which would violate the prohibition contained in Lev. xviii. 16, but &quot;relations.&quot; The story of Judah and his sons (Genesis 38, 8) proves nothing, because at that time the prohibition against marrying a brother&#x27;s wife did not exist. The prohibition contained in Lev. 18, 18 can not be taken literally as the Rabbanites do, for the wife&#x27;s sister is forbidden under any circumstance, just as is the husband&#x27;s brother (there is here an example of the method of analogy, &quot;heqqesh&quot;); it is rather the stepsister of the wife that is meant in the passage in question, e.g., the daughter of the father-in-law&#x27;s wife whom the last named had by her first husband. In this case, the prohibition ends with the wife&#x27;s death.

The daughter is not excluded from the heritage, as the Rabbanites say, although her portion is less than that of the son, being only one-third; for in the law of valuation in connection with vows (Leviticus 27), women were valued less than men. In conformity with this law, the mother also receives one-third. Daniel was possibly influenced here by Muslim fiqh; cf. Quran, an-Nisa 12.

In other respects, Daniel follows the Talmud in holding that the descendants of one entitled to a portion succeed to his entire rights; the children of the son—i.e., grandchildren—taking precedence over the daughter, their aunt. Finally, Daniel holds that responsibility for the observance of the commandments must begin not with the thirteenth, but with the twentieth year; that Rosh Hashanah begins on Yom Kippur on the tenth of Tishri, as follows from Ezek. 40 1, &quot; at the beginning of the year, the tenth day of the month&quot;; and that Muslims also may act as witnesses of the new moon&#x27;s appearance.

Daniel wrote several works in the Hebrew language, all of which, save for a few quotations and fragments, have been lost. There is undeniable evidence that he compiled a legal code (&quot;Sefer ha-Mitzvot&quot; or &quot;Book of Commandments&quot;), and a work on the rights of inheritance. The latter, against which Saadia Gaon directed his polemics, was perhaps merely a part of the code just mentioned. He also wrote commentaries to the Torah, Joshua, and the Book of Judges, and probably to other Biblical books. They were not running commentaries, but explanations to certain passages, and contained also digressions. Words were often explained in Arabic. These commentaries, especially that of the Torah, probably contained many of the decisions enumerated above.

<text>The and tournaments is a split season format for Spanish-speaking sports leagues. It is a relatively recent innovation for many Latin American football leagues in which the traditional association football season from August to May is divided in two sections per season, each with its own champion. &#x27; and&#x27; are the Spanish words for &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closing&quot;. In French-speaking Haiti, these are known as the &#x27; and the&#x27;, while in English-speaking Belize, they are respectively the &quot;Opening&quot; and &quot;Closing&quot; seasons. When used in the United States and Canada, they are known as the &quot;Spring Championship&quot; and &quot;Fall Championship&quot; ().

== The Americas ==
The &quot;&quot; is held in the first half of the calendar year in Bolivia, Colombia, Haiti, Paraguay and Uruguay while it is held in the second half of the calendar year in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua.

The words &#x27; and &#x27; are used in most Latin American countries. Some, however, use different terminology:
* Colombia: &#x27; and &#x27;
* Costa Rica: &#x27; and &#x27; (Spanish for &quot;winter&quot; and &quot;summer&quot;); until the 2016–17 season.

In most leagues, each tournament constitutes a national championship in itself. On the other hand, in the leagues of Nicaragua, Peru, and Uruguay, the winners of the &#x27; and &#x27; play each other in a playoff for the season title, or there is a final stage where teams qualify based on placements in the &#x27; and &#x27;. Thus, two championship titles are awarded per year in the first group of leagues, and only one in the second. In Mexico and Colombia, for instance, the winners of each tournament play each other at the beginning of the following season for another title, but this is a rather minor season curtain-raiser, akin to national Super Cups in European leagues. Some &#x27; and &#x27; tournaments also have second stages to decide the winner.

In leagues with 12 or fewer teams, each &#x27; and &#x27; has a double round-robin format, as a means to fill in the gaps caused by the lack of elimination cup competitions as in most European countries. In leagues with 16 or more teams, each tournament has a single round-robin format.

Relegations, if any, are done on an aggregate basis; usually the combined table for both tournaments determine relegation placements. In some leagues, the average points over the previous two or three seasons are used to determine relegation.

Peru abolished its &#x27; and &#x27; format after the 2008 season but brought it back for the 2014 season. Ecuador adopted the &#x27; and &#x27; in 2005 featuring two champions in the season, however, its subsequent tournaments renamed the &#x27; and &#x27; as first and second stages, respectively, with the top placed teams advancing to a third stage to determine the champion and international qualification. Starting in 2009, the Ecuadorian championships were decided by a final between stage or group winners, maintaining the half-year tournament format.

=== Argentina ===
* Argentina: Starting in 2012–13, &#x27; and &#x27; (Spanish for &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;final&quot;).
Argentine Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona proposed in December 2008 the return to a single championship per season format, and at the conclusion of the 2014 &quot;&quot; season this happened, with the 2015 season taking a European style year long season from February to December. The AFA later decided to change its season to one spanning two calendar years; as such, the 2016 season is an abbreviated tournament held from February to May, followed by an August-to-June season from 2016–17 forward.

=== Belize ===
The Premier League of Belize, created in 2012 by the merger of two rival top-level leagues, began a split season in 2012–13. The Opening Season takes place in the second half of the calendar year, with the Closing Season following in the first half of the next calendar year. Like most Latin American leagues, it crowns two separate champions in each season. However, its format is significantly different from that of most other leagues, being more similar to the system used by Major League Soccer in the United States and Canada.

In the first split season (2012–13), the league&#x27;s 12 teams were divided into two six-team zones. During the first half of the season, every team played a double round-robin within its zone, plus single games against four teams from the opposite zone, resulting in a 14-game schedule. The top two teams from each zone qualified for a playoff round, with the top team from each zone matched against the second-place team from the other zone in the two-legged semifinals. The semifinal winners advanced to a two-legged final. In the second half of the season, only eight of the initial 12 teams competed; all teams played a double round-robin in that half of the season, followed by a four-team knockout playoff (again two-legged throughout).

The number of teams participating in the top flight dropped to seven for the 2013–14 season. Each half of that season will have the same format as the 2013 Closing Season.

=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian national league is a notable tournament in Latin America not to split the season into two parts, using a single-season double round-robin format to decide the champions, similar to those in European leagues, though played between May and December. Brazilian clubs also participate in the state leagues from January to April, some of which do feature a split season format. Brazil also has, unlike most Latin American nations, a national cup.

In 1967 and 1968, the Taça Brasil and Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa were run in the same year, making these years &quot;de facto&quot; Apertura and Clausura seasons. Both tournaments&#x27; winners are recognized as Brazilian champions.

=== Canada ===
For the 2019 season only, the Canadian Premier League adopted a split-season format divided into Spring and Fall seasons. The winner of each part of the season advances to the Canadian Premier League Finals. Following the traditional standard for soccer in the United States and Canada, the season is entirely contained within a calendar year, running April to November. The CPL did not follow a simple double round-robin format; the spring season was an uneven 10 match season, while the fall season was a triple round robin, 18 match season.

=== United States ===

The second incarnation of the North American Soccer League adopted a split-season format in 2013, divided into Spring and Fall Championships. Like other soccer leagues in the United States and Canada, the season was entirely contained within a calendar year. Beginning in 2014, the winner of each season qualified for the playoffs along with the two teams with the best records in the combined seasons; the two season winners previously qualified directly for the Soccer Bowl championship. The seasons were unbalanced, with the fall season completing a full double round-robin while the shorter spring season only had single round-robin. The NASL cancelled its Spring 2018 season after it lost Division II sanctioning from the United States Soccer Federation and later ceased operations amid a legal challenge against the federation.

The third-division National Independent Soccer Association debuted in 2019 with a split season format that was played from fall to spring. The fall and spring seasons both had their own playoffs to determine the league champions. The format was abandoned following the Fall 2021 season as the league moved to a spring-to-fall single-season schedule.

==Elsewhere==
=== Soviet Union ===
The USSR Championship in football among &quot;exhibition teams&quot; (later &quot;teams of masters&quot;) started in 1936. Its first season (1936) contained a split-season format for all four tiers of the championship including Groups (A, B, V, and Ghe). In 1976 a split-season format was once again revived for the Top League only and for a single season. On both occasions the seasons were conducted in a single round-robin tournament.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium a large reform of the Belgian football league system was performed in 2016, which reduced the number of professional teams to 24, with only 8 teams remaining at the second level, called Belgian First Division B. From the 2016–17 season until the 2019–20 season, the 8 teams played two tournaments, with the winners of both tournaments playing a two-legged playoff to determine the overall champion. This format was abolished for the 2020–21 season, and the competition reverted to a traditional format played from August to April.

=== Japan ===
For most of its history (except in 1996) the J. League in Japan had a similar system for its first division, although it was called 1st Stage and 2nd Stage. The seasons became unified in 2005, partially to avoid conflicts with the Emperor&#x27;s Cup. It briefly resumed the same format for 2015 and 2016 seasons.

The Japan Football League, at the fourth tier, briefly introduced the format from 2014 to 2019.

=== Singapore ===
The first season of S.League in 1996 was played in split seasons and a playoff model, with the first series being named Tiger Beer Series, and the second series being named Pioneer Series. Winners of both series then played each other at the end of the season in a championship Playoff, with the winner of the Playoff being crowned the first champion of S.League. This split seasons format has not been used since the first season.

===South Korea===

The K-League of South Korea also had the same system in 1984, 1986, 1995, 2004, 2005, and 2006. In 2007, it again became unified because of confusion among fans.

== and by country==
All the following leagues are their country&#x27;s top national division (Div 1) unless otherwise indicated.
==Other sports==
In baseball, the Double-A Southern and Texas Leagues in the United States both use a similar system, dividing the March–October regular season in half, with records being cleared mid-season, and the top teams mid-season and at the end of the season clinching spots in the playoff for the league pennant (the remainder of playoff slots being filled by wild cards). This system is used in some Single-A leagues, as well. The March–September Chinese Professional Baseball League and winter Mexican Pacific League also follow the same structure, using a team&#x27;s win record in each stage to determine which advance to the playoffs. Japan&#x27;s Pacific League had a split season format from 1973 to 1982, with a mini-playoff between the two winners to determine the league&#x27;s champion.

While Little League Baseball does not mandate any specific scheduling format to be used by local leagues, it recommends dividing the regular season in half and having the first-half winner play against the second-half winner at the end of the season for the championship.

The Philippine Basketball Association also conducts a split season similar in many ways to the &#x27; and &#x27;.

All League of Legends leagues operate on a split-season system, with one split in the spring and one in the summer. The summer is reserved for the spring split playoffs and the Mid-Season Invitational, while the fall is reserved for the summer split playoffs and the League of Legends World Championship. Qualification to the World Championship is decided in one of two ways: finishing within the top three within the second split playoffs (for the LCS) or, for the LCK and LPL, either winning the second split or through a system that awards points based on a team&#x27;s performance in each of the splits, with the best non-qualified teams entering the regional finals for the last one or two spots. Unlike most other split-season formats, the summer split is more important than the spring split; coming second in the summer split is worth as many points as winning the spring split. The LEC has three splits, winter, spring and summer, as well as an end-of-season tournament called Season Finals which decides which teams qualify for the World Championship.

The first four seasons of the National Hockey League used a half-season system, with the winners of the two half-seasons playing in the league final.

<doc id="1130125" wikidata="Q2518067" url="?curid=1130125" title="Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory">
<text>The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory is an unproven conspiracy theory alleging that U.S. government officials had advance knowledge of Japan&#x27;s December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. 

Ever since the Japanese attack, there has been debate as to why and how the United States was caught off guard, and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans for an attack. Several writers, including journalist Robert Stinnett, retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Robert Alfred Theobald, and Harry Elmer Barnes, have argued that various parties high in the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to ensure America’s entry into the European theater of World War II via a Japanese–American war started at &quot;the back door&quot;, despite the fact Germany and Italy were not obliged to assist Japan in the event of aggression against another power. 

The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory is rejected by most historians as a fringe theory, citing several key discrepancies and reliance on dubious sources.

==Ten official U.S. inquiries==
In September 1944, John T. Flynn, a co-founder of the non-interventionist America First Committee, launched a Pearl Harbor counter-narrative when he published a 46-page booklet entitled &quot;The Truth about Pearl Harbor&quot;, arguing that Roosevelt and his inner circle had been plotting to provoke the Japanese into an attack on the U.S. and thus provide a reason to enter the war since January 1941. Flynn was a political opponent of Roosevelt, and had strongly criticized him for both his domestic and foreign policies. In 1944, a congressional investigation conducted by both major political parties provided little by way of vindication for his assertions, despite Flynn being chief investigator.

The U.S. government made nine official inquiries into the attack between 1941 and 1946, and a tenth in 1995. They included an inquiry by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox (1941); the Roberts Commission (1941–42); the Hart Inquiry (1944); the Army Pearl Harbor Board (1944); the Naval Court of Inquiry (1944); the Hewitt investigation; the Clarke investigation; the Congressional Inquiry (Pearl Harbor Committee; 1945–46); a top-secret inquiry by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, authorized by Congress and carried out by Henry Clausen (the Clausen Inquiry; 1946); and the Thurmond-Spence hearing, in April 1995, which produced the Dorn Report. The inquiries reported incompetence, underestimation, and misapprehension of Japanese capabilities and intentions; problems resulting from excessive secrecy about cryptography; division of responsibility between Army and Navy (and lack of consultation between them); and lack of adequate manpower for intelligence (analysis, collection, processing).

Investigators prior to Clausen did not have the security clearance necessary to receive the most sensitive information, as Brigadier General Henry D. Russell had been appointed guardian of the pre-war decrypts, and he alone held the combination to the storage safe. Clausen claimed, in spite of Secretary Stimson having given him a letter informing witnesses he had the necessary clearances to require their cooperation, he was repeatedly lied to until he produced copies of top secret decrypts, thus proving he indeed had the proper clearance.

Stimson&#x27;s report to Congress, based on Clausen&#x27;s work, was limited due to secrecy concerns, largely about cryptography. A more complete account was not made publicly available until the mid-1980s, and not published until 1992 as &quot;Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement&quot;. Reaction to the 1992 publication has varied. Some regard it as a valuable addition to understanding the events, while one historian noted Clausen did not speak to General Walter Short, Army commander at Pearl Harbor during the attack, and called Clausen&#x27;s investigation &quot;notoriously unreliable&quot; in several respects.

== Diplomatic situation ==
Some authors argue that President Roosevelt was actively provoking Japan in the weeks prior to the Pearl Harbor attack. These authors assert that Roosevelt was imminently expecting and seeking war, but wanted Japan to take the first overtly aggressive action.

=== Statements by high-ranking officials ===
One perspective is given by Rear Admiral Frank Edmund Beatty Jr., who at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack was an aide to the Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox and was very close to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s inner circle, remarked that:

Another &quot;eyewitness viewpoint&quot; akin to Beatty&#x27;s is provided by Roosevelt&#x27;s administrative assistant at the time of Pearl Harbor, Jonathan Daniels; it was a comment about FDR&#x27;s reaction to the attack – &quot;The blow was heavier than he had hoped it would necessarily be. ... But the risks paid off; even the loss was worth the price. ...&quot;

&quot;Ten days before the attack on Pearl Harbor&quot;, Henry L. Stimson, United States Secretary of War at the time, &quot;entered in his diary the famous and much-argued statement – that he had met with President Roosevelt to discuss the evidence of impending hostilities with Japan, and the question was &#x27;how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.&#x27;&quot; However Stimson, in reviewing his diary after the war, recalled that the commanders at Pearl Harbor had been warned of the possibility of attack, and that the poor state of readiness that the attack had revealed was a surprise to him:[Yet] General Short had been told the two essential facts: 1) a war with Japan is threatening, 2) hostile action by Japan is possible at any moment. Given these two facts, both of which were stated without equivocation in the message of Nov. 27, the outpost commander should be on the alert to make his fight ...

To cluster his airplanes in such groups and positions that in an emergency they could not take the air for several hours, and to keep his antiaircraft ammunition so stored that it could not be promptly and immediately available, and to use his best reconnaissance system, radar, only for a very small fraction of the day and night, in my opinion betrayed a misconception of his real duty which was almost beyond belief. ...

Robert Stinnett&#x27;s &quot;Day of Deceit&quot; suggests a memorandum prepared by Commander McCollum was central to U.S. policy in the immediate pre-war period. Stinnett claims the memo suggests only a direct attack on U.S. interests would sway the American public (or Congress) to favor direct involvement in the European war, specifically in support of the British. An attack &quot;by Japan&quot; would not, could not, aid Britain. Although the memo was passed to Captains Walter Anderson and Dudley Knox, two of Roosevelt&#x27;s military advisors, on October 7, 1940, there is no evidence to suggest Roosevelt ever saw it, while Stinnett&#x27;s claims of evidence he did is nonexistent. Moreover, although Anderson and Knox offered eight specific plans to aggrieve the Japanese Empire and added, &quot;If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better,&quot; of the eight &quot;plans&quot; (actions to be taken) offered in the memo, many if not all were implemented, but there is considerable doubt the McCollum memo was the inspiration. Nonetheless, in &quot;Day of Deceit&quot; Stinnett claims all action items were implemented. Yet there were numerous instances of members of the Roosevelt Administration insisting on not provoking Japan. Mark Parillo, in his essay &quot;The United States in the Pacific&quot;, wrote, &quot;[t]hese theories tend to founder on the logic of the situation. Had Roosevelt and other members of his administration known of the attack in advance, they would have been foolish to sacrifice one of the major instruments needed to win the war just to get the United States into it.&quot; Furthermore, on November 5, 1941, in a joint memo, Stark, CNO, and Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, warned, &quot;if Japan be defeated and Germany remain undefeated, decision will still not have been reached... War between the United States and Japan should be avoided...&quot; Additionally, in a November 21, 1941, memo, Brigadier Leonard T. Gerow, head of Army War Plans, stated, &quot;one of our present major objectives [is] the avoidance of war with Japan...[and to] insure continuance of material assistance to the British.&quot; He concluded, &quot;[I]t is of grave importance to our war effort in Europe...&quot; Furthermore, Churchill himself, in a May 15, 1940, telegram, said he hoped a U.S. commitment to aid Britain would &quot;quiet&quot; Japan, following with a October 4 message requesting a USN courtesy visit to Singapore aimed at &quot;preventing the spreading of the war&quot; And Stark&#x27;s own Plan Dog expressly stated, &quot;Any strength that we might send to the Far East would...reduce the force of our blows against Germany...&quot; Roosevelt could scarcely have been ignorant of Stark&#x27;s views, and war with Japan was clearly contrary to Roosevelt&#x27;s express wish to aid Britain.

Oliver Lyttelton, the British Minister of War Production, said, &quot;... Japan was provoked into attacking the Americans at Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty of history ever to say that America was forced into the war. Everyone knows where American sympathies were. It is incorrect to say that America was truly neutral even before America came into the war on an all-out basis.&quot; How this demonstrates anything with regard to Japan is unclear. Rather, it refers to other aid to Britain. Lend-Lease, enacted in March 1941, informally declared the end of American neutrality in favor of the Allies by agreeing to supply Allied nations with war materials. In addition, Roosevelt authorized a so-called Neutrality Patrol, which would protect the merchantmen of one nation, namely Britain, from attack by another, Germany. This made shipping legitimate target of attack by submarine. Furthermore, Roosevelt ordered U.S. destroyers to report U-boats, then later authorized them to &quot;shoot on sight&quot;. This made the U.S. a &quot;de facto&quot; belligerent. None was the act of a disinterested neutral, while all are unquestionably of assistance to Britain.

When considering information like this as a point for or against, the reader must keep in mind questions such as: was this official privy to information about the U.S. government? Did he have communications with high-level administration figures such as President Roosevelt or Ambassador Joseph Grew? Is this just a strongly held personal opinion? Or were there measures justifying this view? If Britain, did, indeed know and chose to conceal, &quot;withholding this vital intelligence only ran the risk of losing American trust&quot;, and with it any further American aid, which would be reduced after the attack in any event.

There is also a claim, first asserted in John Toland&#x27;s &quot;Infamy&quot;, that ONI knew about Japanese carrier movements. Toland cited entries from the diary of Rear Admiral J. E. Meijer Ranneft of the Dutch Navy for December 2 and 6. Ranneft attended briefings at ONI on these dates. According to Toland, Ranneft wrote that he was told by ONI that two Japanese carriers were northwest of Honolulu. However, the diary uses the Dutch abbreviation &quot;beW&quot;, meaning &quot;westerly&quot;, contradicting Toland&#x27;s claim. Nor did any other persons present at the briefings report hearing Toland&#x27;s version. In their reviews of &quot;Infamy&quot;, David Kahn and John C. Zimmerman suggested Ranneft&#x27;s reference was to carriers near the Marshall Islands. Toland has made other conflicting and incorrect claims about the diary during lectures at the Holocaust denial organization the Institute for Historical Review.

The diary states at 02:00 (6-12-41) Turner fears a sudden Japanese attack on Manila. At 14:00 the diary states &quot;Everyone present on O.N.I. I speak to Director Admiral Wilkinson, Captain MacCollum, Lt. Cdr. Kramer ... They show me – on my request – the place of the 2 carriers (see 2–12–41) West of Honolulu. I ask what the idea is of these carriers on that place. The answer was: &#x27;perhaps in connection with Japanese rapports [sic] on eventual American actions&#x27;. There is not one of ours who speaks about a possible air attack on Honolulu. I myself did not think of it because I believed everyone on Honolulu to be 100% on the alert, as everyone here on O.N.I. There prevails a tense state of mind at O.N.I.&quot; These diary entries are provided (in Dutch) in the photo section in George Victor&#x27;s &quot;The Pearl Harbor Myth: Rethinking the Unthinkable&quot;.

CBS correspondent Edward R. Murrow had a dinner appointment at the White House on December 7. Because of the attack he and his wife only ate with Mrs. Roosevelt, but the president asked Murrow to stay afterwards. As he waited outside the Oval Office, Murrow observed government and military officials entering and leaving. He wrote after the war:

One historian has written, however, that when Murrow met Roosevelt with William J. Donovan of the OSS that night, while the magnitude of the destruction at Pearl Harbor horrified the president, Roosevelt seemed slightly less surprised by the attack than the other men. According to Murrow, the president told him, &quot;Maybe you think [the attack] didn&#x27;t surprise us!&quot; He said later, &quot;I believed him&quot;, and thought that he might have been asked to stay as a witness. When allegations of Roosevelt&#x27;s foreknowledge appeared after the war, John Gunther asked Murrow about the meeting. Murrow reportedly responded the full story would pay for his son&#x27;s college education and &quot;if you think I&#x27;m going to give it to you, you&#x27;re out of your mind&quot;. Murrow did not write the story, however, before his death.

British-Australian author Jesse Fink asserts in his 2023 biography of MI6 intelligence officer Dick Ellis that Roosevelt knew an attack would be forthcoming. Ellis helped William Donovan set up the Office of Strategic Services and was deputy to William Stephenson at British Security Co-ordination.

In Fink&#x27;s book, &quot;The Eagle in the Mirror&quot;, Ellis is quoted as saying: ‘[Stephenson] was convinced from the information that was reaching him that this attack was imminent, and through Jimmy Roosevelt, President Roosevelt’s son, he passed this information to the President. Now whether the President at that time had other information which corroborated this... it’s impossible to say.&#x27;

=== McCollum memo ===

On October 7, 1940, Lieutenant Commander Arthur H. McCollum of the Office of Naval Intelligence submitted a memo to Navy Captains Walter S. Anderson and Dudley Knox, which details eight actions which might have the effect of provoking Japan into attacking the United States. The memo remained classified until 1994 and contains the notable line, &quot;If by these means Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better.&quot;

Sections 9 and 10 of the memo are said by Gore Vidal to be the &quot;smoking gun&quot; revealed in Stinnett&#x27;s book, suggesting it was central to the high-level plan to lure the Japanese into an attack. Evidence the memo or derivative works actually reached President Roosevelt, senior administration officials, or the highest levels of U.S. Navy command, is circumstantial, at best.

=== Roosevelt&#x27;s desire for war with Germany ===
Theorists challenging the traditional view that Pearl Harbor was a surprise repeatedly note that Roosevelt wanted the U.S. to intervene in the war against Germany, though he did not say so officially. A basic understanding of the political situation of 1941 precludes any possibility the public wanted war. Thomas Fleming argued President Roosevelt wished for Germany or Japan to strike the first blow, but did not expect the United States to be hit as severely as it was in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

An attack by Japan on the U.S. could not guarantee the U.S. would declare war on Germany. After such an attack, American public anger would be directed at Japan, not Germany, just as happened. The Tripartite Pact (Germany, Italy, Japan) called for each to aid another in defense; Japan could not reasonably claim America had attacked Japan if she struck first. For instance, Germany had been at war with the UK since 1939, and with the USSR since June 1941, without Japanese assistance. There had been a serious, if low-level, naval war going on in the Atlantic between Germany and the U.S. since summer of 1941, as well. On October 17 a U-boat torpedoed a U.S. destroyer, &quot;USS Kearny&quot;, inflicting severe damage and killing eleven crewmen. Two weeks after the attack on the &quot;Kearny&quot;, a submarine sank an American destroyer, &quot;USS Reuben James&quot;, killing 115 sailors. Nevertheless, it was only Hitler&#x27;s declaration of war on December 11, unforced by treaty, that brought the U.S. into the European war.

Clausen and Lee&#x27;s &quot;Pearl Harbor: Final Judgement&quot; reproduces a Purple message, dated November 29, 1941, from the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin to Tokyo. A closing paragraph reads, &quot;... He (Ribbentrop) also said that if Japan were to go to war with America, Germany would, of course, join in immediately, and Hitler&#x27;s intention was that there should be absolutely no question of Germany making a separate peace with England. ...&quot;

While theorists who challenge the conventional view that the attack was a surprise treat this as a guarantee to join after Japan&#x27;s attack, it can as easily be taken as a guarantee to come to Japan&#x27;s aid, as Germany had done for Italy in Libya.

==Assertions that Japanese codes had already been broken==
U.S. signals intelligence in 1941 was both impressively advanced and uneven. In 1929, the U.S. MI-8 cryptographic operation in New York City was shut down by Henry Stimson (Hoover&#x27;s newly appointed Secretary of State), citing &quot;ethical considerations&quot;, which inspired its former director, Herbert Yardley, to write a 1931 book, &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot;, about its successes in breaking other nations&#x27; crypto traffic. Most countries responded promptly by changing (and generally improving) their ciphers and codes, forcing other nations to start over in reading their signals. The Japanese were no exception.

Nevertheless, U.S. cryptanalytic work continued after Stimson&#x27;s action in two separate efforts: the Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) and the Navy&#x27;s Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) crypto group, OP-20-G. Cryptanalytic work was kept secret to such an extent, however, that major commands such as the 14th Naval District at Pearl Harbor were prohibited from working on codebreaking by Admiral Kelly Turner.

By late 1941, those organizations had broken several Japanese ciphers, such as J19 and PA-K2, called &quot;Tsu&quot; and &quot;Oite&quot; respectively by the Japanese. The highest security diplomatic code, dubbed Purple by the U.S., had been broken, but American cryptanalysts had made little progress against the IJN&#x27;s current &quot;Kaigun Ango Sho D&quot; (Naval Code D, called AN-1 by the U.S.; JN-25 after March 1942).

In addition, there was a perennial shortage of manpower, thanks to penury on one hand and the perception of intelligence as a low-value career path on the other. Translators were over-worked, cryptanalysts were in short supply, and staffs were generally stressed. In 1942, &quot;Not every cryptogram was decoded. Japanese traffic was too heavy for the undermanned Combat Intelligence Unit.&quot; Furthermore, there were difficulties retaining good intelligence officers and trained linguists; most did not remain on the job for the extended periods necessary to become truly professional. For career reasons, nearly all wanted to return to more standard assignments. However, concerning the manning levels, &quot;... just prior to World War II, [the US] had some 700 people engaged in the effort and [was], in fact, obviously having some successes.&quot; Of these, 85% were tasked to decryption and 50% to translation efforts against IJN codes. The nature and degree of these successes has led to great confusion among non-specialists. Furthermore, OP-20-GY &quot;analysts relied as much on summary reports as on the actual intercepted messages.&quot;

The U.S. was also given decrypted messages by Dutch (NEI) intelligence, who like the others in the British–Dutch–U.S. agreement to share the cryptographic load, shared information with allies. However, the U.S. refused to do likewise. This was, at least in part, due to fears of compromise; sharing even between the US Navy and Army was restricted (e.g see Central Bureau). The eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was tightly and capriciously controlled. At times, even President Roosevelt did not receive all information from code-breaking activities. There were fears of compromise as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with Magic was found in the desk of Brigadier General Edwin M. (Pa) Watson, the President&#x27;s military aide.

=== Purple===
The Japanese code dubbed &quot;Purple&quot;, which was used by the Japanese Foreign Office and only for diplomatic (but not for military) messages, was broken by Army cryptographers in 1940. A 14-part message using this code, sent from Japan to its embassy in Washington, was decoded in Washington on December 6 and 7. The message, which made plain the Japanese intention to break off diplomatic relations with the United States, was to be delivered by the Japanese ambassador at 1 p.m. Washington time (dawn in the Pacific). The SIS decoded the first 13 parts of the message, but did not decode the 14th part of the message until it was too late. Colonel Rufus S. Bratton, then serving as Chief of the Far Eastern Section of G-2 (intelligence), was responsible for receiving and distributing Magic intercepts to senior military and government officials. In Bratton&#x27;s view, the 14-part message by itself merely signaled a break in diplomatic relations, which appeared to be inevitable anyway. Others saw it differently: Roosevelt, upon reviewing just the first 13-parts (and without part 14 or the 1 p.m. delivery requirement) declared &quot;this means war&quot;, and when Marshall was given the intercept on the morning of December 7, ordered a warning message sent to American bases in the area, including Hawaii. Due to atmospheric transmission conditions the message was sent out via Western Union over its undersea cable rather than over the military radio channels; the message was not received until the attack was already underway.

The claim no pre-attack IJN message expressly mentioned Pearl Harbor is perhaps true. The claims that no Purple traffic pointed to Pearl Harbor may also be true, as the Japanese Foreign Office was not well thought of by the military and during this period was routinely excluded from sensitive or secret material, including war planning. It is also possible any such intercepts were not translated until after the attack, or indeed, after the war ended; some messages were not. In both instances, all traffic from these pre-attack intercepts has not yet been declassified and released to the public domain. Hence, any such claims are now indeterminate, pending a fuller accounting.

Additionally, no decrypts have come to light of JN-25B traffic with any intelligence value prior to Pearl Harbor, and certainly no such has been identified. Such breaks as recorded by authors W. J. Holmes and Clay Blair Jr., were into the additive tables, which was a required second step of three (see above). The first 100 JN-25 decrypts from all sources in date/time order of translation have been released, and are available in the National Archives. The first JN-25B decrypt was in fact by  (Hawaii) on January 8, 1942 (numbered #1 up JN-25B RG38 CNSG Library, Box 22, 3222/82 NA CP). The first 25 decrypts were very short messages or partial decrypts of marginal intelligence value. As Whitlock stated, &quot;The reason that not one single JN-25 decrypt made prior to Pearl Harbor has ever been found or declassified is not due to any insidious cover-up... it is due quite simply to the fact that no such decrypt ever existed. It simply was not within the realm of our combined cryptologic capability to produce a usable decrypt at that particular juncture.&quot;

===JN-25===

The JN-25 superencrypted code, and its cryptanalysis by the US, is one of the most debated portions of Pearl Harbor lore. JN-25 is the U.S. Navy&#x27;s last of several names for the cryptosystem of the Imperial Japanese Navy, sometimes referred to as Naval Code D. Other names used for it include five-numeral, 5Num, five-digit, five-figure, AN (JN-25 Able), and AN-1 (JN-25 Baker), and so on.

Superenciphered codes of this sort were widely used and were the state of the art in practical cryptography at the time. JN-25 was very similar in principle to the British &quot;Naval Cypher No. 3&quot;, known to have been broken by Germany during World War II.

Once it was realized what sort of cryptosystem JN-25 was, how to attempt breaking into it was known. Stinnett notes the existence of a USN handbook for attacks on such a system, produced by OP-20-G. Even so, breaking any such code was not easy in actual practice. It took much effort and time, not least in accumulating sufficient &#x27;cryptanalytic depth&#x27; in intercepted messages prior to the outbreak of hostilities when IJN radio traffic increased abruptly and substantially; prior to December 7, 1941, IJN radio traffic was limited, since the IJN played only a minor role in the war against China and therefore was only rarely required to send radio messages whatever the highest level crypto system might have been. (As well, interception of IJN traffic off China would have been at best spotty.) Rather oddly however, the official history of GYP-1 shows nearly 45,000 IJN messages intercepted during the period from June 1, 1941, until December 4, 1941. Thus, most Japanese encrypted broadcast military radio traffic was Army traffic associated with the land operations in China, none of which used IJN cryptography. 

Breaking a superencrypted cipher like JN-25 was a three-step process: (a) determining the &quot;indicator&quot; method to establish the starting point within the additive cipher, (b) stripping away the superencryption to expose the bare code, and then (c) breaking the code itself. When JN-25 was first detected and recognized, such intercepted messages as were interceptable were collected (at assorted intercept stations around the Pacific by the Navy) in an attempt to accumulate sufficient depth to attempt to strip away the superencryption. Success at doing so was termed by the cryptographers a &#x27;break&#x27; into the system. Such a break did not always produce a cleartext version of the intercepted message; only a break in the third phase could do so. Only after breaking the underlying code (another difficult process) would the message be available, and even then its meaning—in an intelligence sense—might be less than fully clear.

When a new edition was released, the cryptographers were forced to start again. The original JN-25A system replaced the &#x27;Blue&#x27; code (as Americans called it), and used five-digit numbers, each divisible by three (and so usable as a quick, and somewhat reliable, error check, as well as something of a &#x27;crib&#x27; to cryptanalysts), giving a total of 33,334 legal code values. To make it harder to crack a code value, meaningless additives (from a large table or book of five-digit numbers) were added arithmetically to each five-digit cipher element. JN-25B superseded the first release of JN-25 at the start of December 1940. JN-25B had 55,000 valid words, and while it initially used the same additive list, this was soon changed and the cryptanalysts found themselves entirely locked out again.

Over the years, various claims have been made as to the progress made decrypting this system, and arguments made over when it was readable (in whole or part). Lt. &quot;Honest John&quot; Leitwiler, Commander of Station CAST, the Philippines, stated in November 1941 that his staff could &quot;walk right across&quot; the number columns of the coded messages. He is frequently quoted in support of claims JN-25 was then mostly readable. This comment, however, refers not to the message itself but to the superenciphering additives and referred to the ease of attacking the code using a new method for discovery of additive values.

The November 16, 1941, letter to L.W. Parks (OP-20-GY) sent by Leitwiler states, &quot;We have stopped work on the period 1 February to 31 July as we have all we can do to keep up with the current period. We are reading enough current traffic to keep two translators very busy.&quot; Another document, Exhibit No. 151 (Memoranda from Captain L. F. Safford) from the Hewitt Inquiry has a copy of the U.S. Navy message OPNAV-242239 &#x27;Evaluation of Messages of November 26, 1941&#x27; which has in part: &#x27;1. Reference (a) advised that Com 16 intercepts were considered most reliable and requested Com 16 to evaluate reports on Japanese naval movements and send dispatch to OPNAV, info CINCPAC. Com 16&#x27;s estimates were more reliable than Com 14&#x27;s, not only because of better radio interception, but because Com 16 was currently reading messages in the Japanese Fleet Cryptographic System (&quot;5-number code&quot; or &quot;JN25&quot;) and was exchanging technical information and Japanese-to-English translations with the British unit (the Far East Combined Bureau) then at Singapore. Lt. Cdr. Arthur H. McCollum was aware of this, and it may have been part of his thinking when he drafted the McCollum memo. Duane L. Whitlock, traffic analyst at , was not aware before the attack IJN movement traffic code was being read. &quot;Reading&quot; in this context means being able to see the underlying code groups, not breaking out the messages into usable plaintext. The Hewitt Inquiry document also states, &quot;The &quot;5 numeral system&quot; (JN-25B) yielded no information which would arouse even a suspicion of the Pearl Harbor raid, either before or afterward.&quot;

Detailed month by month progress reports have shown no reason to believe any JN-25B messages were fully decrypted before the start of the war. Tallied results for September, October, and November reveal roughly 3,800 code groups (out of 55,000, about 7%) had been recovered by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In all, the U.S. intercepted 26,581 messages in naval or related systems, not counting , between September and December 1941 alone.

So convinced were U.S. Navy planners Japan could only stage a single operation at a time, after intercepts indicated a Japanese buildup for operations in the Dutch East Indies, for more than two weeks (between November 1 and 17), no JN-25 message not relating to that expected operation was even examined for intelligence value.

==Japanese intelligence==
Japanese espionage against Pearl Harbor involved at least two &quot;Abwehr&quot; agents. One of them, Otto Kuhn, was a sleeper agent living in Hawaii with his family. Kuhn was incompetent and there is no evidence he provided information of value. The other, Yugoslavian businessman Duško Popov, was a double agent, working for the XX Committee of MI5. In August 1941, he was sent by the &quot;Abwehr&quot; to the U.S., with an assignment list that included specific questions about military facilities in Oahu, including Pearl Harbor. Although British Security Coordination introduced Popov to the FBI, the Americans seem to have paid little attention. It is possible that previous propaganda and forged or unreliable intelligence contributed to J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s dismissing Popov&#x27;s interest in Pearl Harbor as unimportant. There is nothing to show his assignment list was passed on to military intelligence, nor was he allowed to visit Hawaii. Popov later asserted his list was a clear warning of the attack, ignored by the bungling FBI. The questions in his list were rambling and general, and in no way pointed to air attack on Pearl Harbor. Prange considered Popov&#x27;s claim overblown, and argued the notorious questionnaire was a product of &quot;Abwehr&quot; thoroughness.

The Japanese navy realized that Kuhn was incompetent, but the issues were greater than that, and they concluded using non Japanese for this kind of role was not a good idea to start with. In the two years before the attack, the FBI had caught an effort to by Itaru Tachibana to send a ex sailor named Alva Blake to Pearl Harbor to gather information, and they also had had their longer term agent Frederick Rutland spend two weeks looking around Hawaii.

The net was someone Japanese was needed, so at the comparatively late date of March 1941, IJN intelligence sent an undercover officer, Takeo Yoshikawa. The consulate had reported to IJN Intelligence for years, and Yoshikawa increased the rate of reports after his arrival. (Sometimes called a &quot;master spy&quot;, he was in fact quite young, and his reports not infrequently contained errors.) Pearl Harbor base security was so lax Yoshikawa had no difficulty obtaining access, even taking the Navy&#x27;s own harbor tourboat. (Even had he not, hills overlooking the Harbor were perfect for observation or photography, and were freely accessible.) Some of his information, and presumably other material from the Consulate, was hand-delivered to IJN intelligence officers aboard Japanese commercial vessels calling at Hawaii prior to the War; at least one is known to have been deliberately routed to Hawaii for this purpose during the summer. Most, however, seem to have been transmitted to Tokyo, almost certainly &quot;via&quot; cable (the usual communication method with Tokyo). Many of those messages were intercepted and decrypted by the U.S.; most were evaluated as routine intelligence gathering all nations do about potential opponents, rather than evidence of an active attack plan. None of those currently known, including those decrypted after the attack when there was finally time to return to those remaining undecrypted, explicitly stated anything about an attack on Pearl Harbor.

In November 1941, advertisements for a new board game called &quot;The Deadly Double&quot; appeared in American magazines. These ads later drew suspicion for possibly containing coded messages, for unknown agents, giving advance notice of the Pearl Harbor attack. The ads were headlined &quot;Achtung, Warning, Alerte!&quot; and showed an air raid shelter and a pair of white and black dice which, despite being six-sided, carried the figures 12, 24, and XX, and 5, 7, and 0, respectively. It was suggested that these could possibly be interpreted as giving warning of an air raid on day &quot;7&quot; of month &quot;12&quot; at approximate latitude coordinate &quot;20&quot; (Roman numeral &quot;XX&quot;). The board game was an actual product with sets sold during this time.

== Detection of Japanese radio transmissions en route ==

=== Alleged detection by &quot;SS Lurline&quot; ===

There are claims that, as the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; (the Striking Force) steamed toward Hawaii, radio signals were detected that alerted U.S. intelligence to the imminent attack. For instance, the Matson liner , heading from San Francisco to Hawaii on its regular route, is said to have heard and plotted, via &quot;relative bearings&quot;, unusual radio traffic in a telegraphic code very different from International Morse which persisted for several days, and came from signal source(s) moving in an easterly direction, not from shore stations—possibly the approaching Japanese fleet. There are numerous Morse Code standards including those for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Greek. To the experienced radio operator, each has a unique and identifiable pattern. For example, &quot;kana&quot;, International Morse, and &quot;Continental&quot; Morse all have a specific rhythmic sound to the &quot;dit&quot; and &quot;dah&quot; combinations. This is how &quot;Lurline&quot;″s radiomen, Leslie Grogan, a U.S. Navy reserve officer in naval communications, and with decades of maritime service in the Pacific identified the mooted signal source as Japanese and not, say, Russian.

There are several problems with this analysis. Surviving officers from the Japanese ships state there was no radio traffic to have been overheard by anyone: their radio operators had been left in Japan to send fake traffic, and all radio transmitters aboard the ships (even those in the airplanes) were physically disabled to prevent any inadvertent or unauthorized broadcast.

The &quot;Kido Butai&quot; was constantly receiving intelligence and diplomatic updates. Regardless of whether the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; broke radio silence and transmitted, there was a great deal of radio traffic picked up by its antennas. In that time period, it was known for a radio signal to reflect from the ionosphere (an atmospheric layer); ionospheric skip could result in its reception hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Receiving antennas were sometimes detected passively &#x27;rebroadcasting&#x27; signals that reached them at much lower amplitudes, sufficiently low that the phenomenon was not of practical importance, nor even of much significance. Some have argued that, since the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; contained a large number of possible receiving antennas, it is conceivable the task force did not break radio silence but was detected anyway.

Such detection would not have helped the Americans track the Japanese fleet. A radio direction finder (DF or RDF) from that time period reported compass direction without reference to distance. (Moreover, it was common for the receiving stations to report erroneous reciprocal bearings.) To locate the source, a plotter needed two such detections taken from two separate stations to triangulate and find the target. If the target was moving, the detections must be close to one another in time. To plot the task force&#x27;s course with certainty, at least four such detections must have been made in proper time-pairs, and the information analyzed in light of further information received by other means. This complex set of requirements did not occur; if the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; was detected, it was not tracked.

The original records of &quot;Lurline&quot; surrendered to Lt. Cmdr. George W. Pease, 14th Naval District in Honolulu, have disappeared. Neither &quot;Lurline&quot;″s log, nor the reports to the Navy or Coast Guard by Grogan in Hawaii have been found. Thus no contemporaneously written evidence of what was recorded aboard &quot;Lurline&quot; is now available. Grogan commented on a signal source &quot;moving&quot; eastward in the North Pacific over several days as shown via &quot;relative bearings&quot; which then &quot;bunched up&quot; and stopped moving. However, the directions given by Grogan in a recreation of the logbook for the Matson Line were 18 and 44° off from known strike force positions and instead pointed towards Japan. According to author Jacobsen, Japanese commercial shipping vessels are the likely source. A re-discovered personal report written by Grogan after the radio log had been passed to the 13th Naval District, dated December 10, 1941, and titled &quot;Record for Posterity&quot;, also does not support claims of &quot;Kido Butai&quot; broadcasting.

=== Other alleged detections ===
The contention that &quot;low-powered&quot; radio (such as VHF or what the U.S. Navy called TBS, or talk between ships), might have been used, and detected, is contradicted as impossible due to the tremendous distances involved and when contact was lost, it was routinely presumed it was because low-powered radio and land line were being used. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for specific RDF reports remain wanting. &quot;A more critical analysis of the source documentation shows that not one single radio direction finder bearing, much less any locating &quot;fix,&quot; was obtained on any Kido Butai unit or command during its transit from Saeki Bay, Kyushu to Hitokappu Bay and thence on to Hawaii. By removing this fallacious lynchpin propping up such claims of Kido Butai radio transmissions, the attendant suspected conspiracy tumbles down like a house of cards.&quot;

One suggested example of a &quot;Kido Butai&quot; transmission is the November 30, 1941, COMSUM14 report in which Rochefort mentioned a &quot;tactical&quot; circuit heard calling &quot;&quot;maru&quot;s&quot;. (a term often used for commercial vessels or non-combat units). Further, the perspective of U.S. naval intelligence at the time was, &quot;... The significance of the term, &#x27;tactical circuit&#x27; is that the vessel itself, that is &quot;Akagi&quot;, was using its own radio to call up the other vessels directly rather than work them through shore stations via the broadcast method which was the common practice in Japanese communications. The working of the &quot;Akagi&quot; with the Marus, indicated that she was making arrangements for fuel or some administrative function, since a carrier would rarely address a maru.&quot;

=== Japanese radio silence ===

According to a 1942 Japanese after action report, &quot;In order to keep strict radio silence, steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit, and holding and sealing the keys were taken. During the operation, the strict radio silence was perfectly carried out... The &quot;Kido Butai&quot; used the radio instruments for the first time on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well. Paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board to keep the strictest radio silence...&quot; Commander Genda, who helped plan the attack, stated, &quot;We kept absolute radio silence.&quot; For two weeks before the attack, the ships of &quot;Kido Butai&quot; used flag and light signals (semaphore and blinker), which were sufficient since task force members remained in line of sight for the entire transit time. Kazuyoshi Kochi, the communications officer for , dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent &quot;Hiei&quot; from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced. Lieutenant Commander Chuichi Yoshioka, communications officer of the flagship, &quot;Akagi&quot;, said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack. Furthermore, Captain Kijiro, in charge of the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;″s three screening submarines, stated nothing of interest happened on the way to Hawaii, presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent . Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka stated, &quot;It is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the Task Force. To keep radio silence was easy to say, but not so easy to maintain.&quot; There is nothing in the Japanese logs or after action report indicating that radio silence was broken until after the attack. Kusaka worried about this when it was briefly broken on the way home.

The appendix to the war-initiating operational order is also often debated. The message of November 25, 1941, from CinC Combined Fleet (Yamamoto) to All Flagships stated, &quot;Ships of the Combined Fleet will observe radio communications procedure as follows: 1. Except in extreme emergency the Main Force and its attached force will cease communicating. 2. Other forces are at the discretion of their respective commanders. 3. Supply ships, repair ships, hospital ships, etc., will report directly to parties concerned.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;In accordance with this Imperial Operational Order, the CinC of the Combined Fleet issued his operational order ... The Task Force &quot;then drew up its own operational order&quot;, which was given for the first time to the whole force at Hitokappu Bay... In paragraph four of the appendix to that document, the especially secret Strike Force was specifically directed to &#x27;maintain strict radio silence from the time of their departure from the Inland Sea. Their communications will be handled entirely on the general broadcast communications net.&#x27;&quot; In addition, Genda recalled, in a 1947 interview, &quot;Kido Butai&quot;″s communications officer issuing this order, with the task force to rely (as might be expected) on flag and blinker.

== Radio deception measures ==
The Japanese practiced radio deception. Susumu Ishiguru, intelligence and communications officer for Carrier Division Two, stated, &quot;Every day false communications emanated from Kyushu at the same time and same wavelength as during the training period.&quot; Because of this, Commander Joseph Rochefort of Hawaii Signals Intelligence concluded that the First Air Fleet remained in home waters for routine training. The ships left their own regular wireless operators behind to carry on &quot;routine&quot; radio traffic. Captain Sadatoshi Tomioka stated, &quot;The main force in the Inland Sea and the land-based air units carried out deceptive communications to indicate the carriers were training in the Kyushu area.&quot; The main Japanese naval bases (Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo) all engaged in considerable radio deception. Analysis of the bearings from Navy DF stations account for claimed breaks of radio silence, and when plotted, the bearings point to Japanese naval bases, not where the &quot;Kido Butai&quot; actually was. On November 26, reported all Japan&#x27;s aircraft carriers were at their home bases.
Rochefort, with Huckins and Williams, states there were no dummy messages used at any time throughout 1941 and no effort by the Japanese to use serious deception.

When asked after the attack just how he knew where &quot;Akagi&quot; was, Rochefort (who commanded at the time) said he recognized her &quot;same ham-fisted&quot; radio operators. (The Japanese contend that radio operators were left behind as part of the deception operation.) The critical DF-tracked radio transmissions show bearings that could have not come from the strike force. Emissions monitored from , or &#x27;s report &quot;Akagi&quot; was off Okinawa on December 8, 1941, are examples, though some transmissions continue to be debated.

To deceive radio eavesdroppers, &quot;IJN Settsu&quot; commanded by Captain Chiaki Matsuda sailed from Taiwan to the Philippines simulating radio traffic for all six fleet carriers of the 1st Air Fleet and two other light carriers.

== U.S. contact with Japanese submarines ==

A Japanese two-man &quot;midget&quot; submarine, one of five eventually discovered, was detected at 0342 in the sea lanes leading to Pearl Harbor, and sunk by the destroyer outside the harbor entrance at 0645, just over an hour before the main Japanese air attack commenced. The detection of the submarine might have provided enough notice for the Americans to disperse aircraft and launch reconnaissance aircraft, however, the process of encoding the message and sending it from &quot;Ward&quot; radio shack took valuable time, and the decoding process at CINCPACFLT would have added to the delay. It has been argued that the failure to investigate more thoroughly the threat of more midget subs saved . If she had been correctly directed, she might have run into the six-carrier Japanese strike force.

After the attack, the search for the attack force was concentrated south of Pearl Harbor, continuing the confusion and ineffectiveness of the American response.

==Allied intelligence==
Locally, Naval Intelligence in Hawaii had been tapping telephones at the Japanese Consulate before the 7th. Among much routine traffic was overheard a most peculiar discussion of flowers in a call to Tokyo (the significance of which is still publicly opaque and which was discounted in Hawaii at the time), but the Navy&#x27;s tap was discovered and removed in the first week of December. The local FBI field office was informed of neither the tap nor its removal; the local FBI Agent in charge later claimed he would have had installed one of his own had he known the Navy&#x27;s had been disconnected.

Throughout 1941, the U.S., Britain, and the Netherlands collected considerable evidence suggesting Japan was planning some new military venture. The Japanese attack on the U.S. in December was essentially a side operation to the main Japanese thrust to the South against Malaya and the Philippines—many more resources, especially Imperial Army resources, were devoted to these attacks as compared to Pearl Harbor. Many in the Japanese military (both Army and Navy) had disagreed with Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s idea of attacking the U.S. Fleet at Pearl Harbor when it was first proposed in early 1941, and remained reluctant after the Navy approved planning and training for an attack beginning in spring 1941, and through the highest level Imperial Conferences in September and November which first approved it as policy (allocation of resources, preparation for execution), and then authorized the attack. The Japanese focus on Southeast Asia was quite accurately reflected in U.S. intelligence assessments; there were warnings of attacks against Thailand (the Kra Peninsula), Malaya, French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies (Davao-Weigo Line), the Philippines, even Russia. Pearl Harbor was not mentioned. In fact, when the final part of the &quot;14-Part Message&quot; (also called the &quot;one o&#x27;clock message&quot;) crossed Kramer&#x27;s desk, he cross-referenced the time (&quot;per&quot; usual practice, not the brainwave often portrayed) and tried to connect the timing to a Japanese convoy (the Thai invasion force) recently detected by Admiral Hart in the Philippines.

The U.S. Navy was aware of the traditional planning of the Imperial Japanese Navy for war with the U.S., as maintained throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s. The Japanese made no secret of it, and in the 1930s American radio intelligence gave U.S. war planners considerable insight in Japanese naval exercises. These plans presumed there would be a large &quot;decisive battle&quot; between Japanese and U.S. battleships, but this would be fought near Japan, after the numerical superiority of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (assured by the Washington Naval Treaty, and still taken as given) was whittled down by primarily night attacks by light forces, such as destroyers and submarines. This strategy expected the Japanese fleet to take a defensive posture, awaiting U.S. attack, and it was confirmed by the Japanese Navy staff only three weeks before Pearl Harbor. In the 1920s, the decisive battle was supposed to happen near the Ryukyu islands; in 1940 it was expected to occur in the central Pacific, near the Marshall islands. War Plan Orange reflected this in its own planning for an advance across the Pacific. Yamamoto&#x27;s decision to shift the focus of the confrontation with the U.S. as far east as Pearl Harbor, and to use his aircraft carriers to cripple the American battleships, was a radical enough departure from previous doctrine to leave analysts in the dark.

There had been a specific claim of a plan for an attack on Pearl Harbor from the Peruvian Ambassador to Japan in early 1941. (The source of this intelligence was traced to the Ambassador&#x27;s Japanese cook. It was treated with skepticism, and properly so, given the nascent state of planning for the attack at the time and the unreliability of the source.) Since Yamamoto had not yet decided to even argue for an attack on Pearl Harbor, discounting Ambassador Grew&#x27;s report to Washington in early 1941 was quite sensible. Later reports from a Korean labor organization also seem to have been regarded as unlikely, though they may have had better grounding in actual IJN actions. In August 1941, British Intelligence, MI6, dispatched its agent Duško Popov, code name Tricycle, to Washington to alert the FBI about German requests for detailed intelligence about defenses at Pearl Harbor, indicating that the request had come from Japan. Popov further revealed that the Japanese had requested detailed information about the British attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto. For whatever reason, the FBI took no action.

=== British advance knowledge and withholding claims ===

Several authors have controversially claimed that Winston Churchill had significant advance knowledge of the attack on Pearl Harbor but intentionally chose not to share this information with the Americans in order to secure their participation in the war. These authors allege that Churchill knew that the Japanese were planning an imminent attack against the United States by mid-November 1941. They furthermore claim that Churchill knew that the Japanese fleet was leaving port on November 26, 1941, to an unknown destination. Finally, they claim that on December 2, British intelligence intercepted Admiral Yamamoto&#x27;s signal indicating December 7 as the day of an attack.

One story from author Constantine Fitzgibbon claimed that a letter received from Victor Cavendish-Bentinck stated that Britain&#x27;s JIC met and discussed at length the impending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. From a Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee session of December 5, 1941 it was stated &quot;We knew that they changed course. I remember presiding over a J.I.C. meeting and being told that a Japanese fleet was sailing in the direction of Hawaii, asking &#x27;Have we informed our transatlantic brethren?&#x27; and receiving an affirmative reply.&quot; However the author was incorrect. There was no session on December 5 nor was Pearl Harbor discussed when they did meet on December 3.

==Official U.S. war warnings==
In late November 1941, both the U.S. Navy and Army sent explicit warnings of war with Japan to all Pacific commands. On November 27 Washington sent a final alert to Pacific American military commanders, such as the message sent to Admiral Kimmel at Pearl Harbor, which read in part: &quot;This dispatch is to be considered a war warning...an aggression move by Japan is expected within the next days.&quot; Although these plainly stated the high probability of imminent war with Japan, and instructed recipients to be accordingly on alert for war, they did not mention the likelihood of an attack on Pearl Harbor itself, instead focusing on the Far East. Washington forwarded none of the raw intelligence it had, and little of its intelligence estimates (after analysis), to commanders in Hawaii, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. Short. Washington did not solicit their views about likelihood of war or Hawaiian special concerns. Washington&#x27;s war warning messages have also been criticized by some (e.g., the U.S. Army Pearl Harbor Board – &quot;Do/Don&#x27;t Messages&quot;) as containing &quot;conflicting and imprecise&quot; language.

Since the Army was officially responsible for the security of the Pearl Harbor facilities and Hawaiian defense generally, and so of the Navy&#x27;s ships while in port, Army actions are of particular interest. Short reported to Washington he had increased his alert level (but his earlier change in meaning for those levels was not understood in Washington and led to misunderstanding there about what he was really doing). In addition, Short&#x27;s main concern was sabotage from fifth columnists (expected to precede the outbreak of war for decades preceding the attack), which accounts for his orders that Army Air Corps planes be parked close together near the center of the airfields. There seems to have been no increased Army urgency about getting its existing radar equipment properly integrated with the local command and control in the year it had been available and operational in Hawaii before the attack. Leisurely radar training continued and the recently organized early warning center was left minimally staffed. Anti-aircraft guns remained in a state of low readiness, with ammunition in secured lockers. Neither Army long-range bombers nor Navy PBYs were used effectively, remaining on a peacetime maintenance and use schedule. Short evidently failed to understand he had the responsibility to defend the fleet. In Short&#x27;s defense, it should be noted he had training responsibilities to meet, and the best patrol aircraft, B-17s and B-24s, were in demand in the Philippines and Britain, both of which had higher priority (he wanted &quot;at least 180 heavy bombers&quot;, but already had 35 B-17s, and was getting 12 more).

Little was done to prepare for air attack. Inter-service rivalries between Kimmel and Short did not improve the situation. In particular, most intelligence information was sent to Kimmel, assuming he would relay it to Short, and &quot;vice versa&quot;; this assumption was honored mostly in the breach. Hawaii did not have a Purple cipher machine (although, by agreement at the highest levels between U.S. and UK cryptographic establishments, four had been delivered to the British by October 1941), so Hawaii remained dependent on Washington for intelligence from that (militarily limited) source. However, since Short had no liaison with Kimmel&#x27;s intelligence staff, he was usually left out of the loop. Henry Clausen reported the war warnings could not be more precise because Washington could not risk Japan guessing the U.S. was reading important parts of their traffic (most importantly Purple), as well as because neither was cleared to receive Purple.

One major point often omitted from the debate (though Costello covers it thoroughly) is the Philippines, where MacArthur, unlike Kimmel or Short, had complete access to all decrypted Purple and JN-25 traffic could provide (indeed, Stinnet quotes Whitlock to that effect), and was nevertheless caught unprepared and with all planes on the ground, nine hours after the Pearl Harbor attack. Caidin and Blair also raise the issue.

Although it has been argued that there was sufficient intelligence at the time to give commanders at Pearl Harbor a greater level of alert, some factors may take on unambiguous meaning not clear at the time, lost in what Roberta Wohlstetter in her masterful examination of the situation called &quot;noise&quot;, &quot;scattered amid the dross of many thousands of other intelligence bits, some of which just as convincingly pointed to a Japanese attack on the Panama Canal.&quot;

==Role of American carriers==
None of the three U.S. Pacific Fleet aircraft carriers were in Pearl Harbor when the attack came. This has been alleged by some to be evidence of advance knowledge of the attack by those in charge of their disposition; the carriers were supposedly away so as to save them (the most valuable ships) from attack.

In fact, the two carriers then operating with the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot;, were on missions to deliver fighters to Wake and Midway Islands, which were intended in part to protect the route used by planes (including B-17s) bound for the Philippines (the third, &quot;Saratoga&quot;, was in routine refit in Puget Sound, at the Bremerton shipyard). At the time of the attack, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was about west of Pearl Harbor, heading back. In fact, &quot;Enterprise&quot; had been scheduled to be back on December 6, but was delayed by weather. A new arrival estimate put her arrival at Pearl around 07:00, almost an hour before the attack, but she was also unable to make that schedule.

Furthermore, at the time, aircraft carriers were classified as fleet scouting elements, and hence relatively expendable. They were not capital ships. The most important vessels in naval planning even as late as Pearl Harbor were battleships (&quot;per&quot; the Mahan doctrine followed by both the U.S. and Japanese navies at the time). Carriers became the Navy&#x27;s most important ships only following the attack.

At the time, naval establishments all over the world regarded battleships, not carriers, as the most powerful and significant elements of naval power. Had the U.S. wanted to preserve its key assets from attack, it would almost certainly have focused on protecting battleships. It was the attack on Pearl Harbor itself that first helped vault the carrier ahead of the battleship in importance. The attack demonstrated the carrier&#x27;s unprecedented ability to attack the enemy at a great distance, with great force and surprise. The U.S. would turn this ability against Japan. Elimination of battleships from the Pacific Fleet forced the Americans to rely on carriers for offensive operations.

== Lack of court-martial ==

Another issue in the debate is the fact neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short ever faced court martial. It is alleged this was to avoid disclosing information showing the U.S. had advanced knowledge of the attack. When asked, &quot;Will historians know more later?&quot;, Kimmel replied, &quot;&#x27; ... I&#x27;ll tell you what I believe. I think that most of the incriminating records have been destroyed. ... I doubt if the truth will ever emerge.&#x27; ...&quot; From Vice Admiral Libby, &quot;I will go to my grave convinced that FDR ordered Pearl Harbor to let happen.
He must have known.&quot; It could also be the case that this was done to avoid disclosing the fact that Japanese codes were being read, given that there was a war on. 

==Unreleased classified information==
Part of the controversy of the debate centers on the state of documents pertaining to the attack. There are some related to Pearl Harbor which have not yet been made public. Some may no longer exist, as many documents were destroyed early during the war due to fears of an impending Japanese invasion of Hawaii. Still others are partial and mutilated.

Conflicting stories regarding FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests for the source materials used, e.g., Sheet Number 94644, or materials available at the National Archives are also common among the debate. However, much information has been said to have been automatically destroyed under a destruction of classified information policy during the war itself. Various authors have nevertheless continued to bring classified Pearl Harbor materials to light via FOIA.

For instance, Sheet No. 94644 derives from its reference in the FOIA-released Japanese Navy Movement Reports of Station H in November 1941. Entries for November 28, 1941, have several more items of interest, each being a &quot;movement code&quot; message (indicating ship movements or movement orders), with specific details given by associated Sheet Numbers. Examples are: Sheet No. 94069 has information on &quot;KASUGA MARU&quot; – this being hand-written (&quot;Kasuga Maru&quot; was later converted to CVE &quot;Taiyo&quot;); Sheet No. 94630 is associated with IJN oiler &quot;Shiriya&quot; (detailed to the Midway Neutralization Force, with destroyers &quot;Ushio&quot; and &quot;Sazanami&quot;, not the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;); and finally for Sheet No. 94644 there is another hand-written remark &quot;FAF using Akagi xtmr&quot; (First Air Fleet using &quot;Akagi&quot;&#x27;s transmitter). It is known that the movement reports were largely readable at the time.

These three documents (Sheet Numbers 94069, 94630, and 94644) are examples of materials which yet, even after decades and numerous specific FOIA requests, have not been declassified fully and made available to the public. Sheet Number 94644, for example, noted as coming from &quot;Akagi&quot;&#x27;s transmitter and as being a &quot;movement code&quot; report, would have likely contained a reported position.

=== Forgeries ===

A purported transcript of a conversation between Roosevelt and Churchill in late November 1941 was analyzed and determined to be fake. There are claims about these conversations; much of this is based on fictional documents, often cited as &quot;Roll T-175&quot; at the National Archives. There is no Roll T-175; NARA does not use that terminology.

Background notes: (A) Clausen was the assistant recorder for the APHB (Army Pearl Harbor Board) and (B) Bruce Lee was the editor for Prange&#x27;s &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot; and Layton&#x27;s &quot;And I Was There&quot; (See Layton, pages 508–509).
*Martin V. Melosi, &quot;The Shadow of Pearl Harbor: Political Controversy of the Surprise Attack, 1941–1946&quot; (Texas A&amp;M University Press, 1977). Central focus is on the political motivations and partisanship during the war years which delayed public disclosure of the details surrounding this attack, and forced the decision not to court martial Kimmel or Short.
*Ladislas Farago, &quot;The Broken Seal: The Story of Operation Magic and the Pearl Harbor Disaster&quot; (Random House, 1967). Bantam paperback edition Postscript contains an account of &quot;Lurline&quot;&#x27;s &quot;interception&quot; and the &quot;disappearing logbook&quot;.
*Edwin T. Layton (with Pineau and Costello), &quot;And I Was There – Pearl Harbor and Midway – Breaking the Secrets&quot; (William Morrow and Company, 1985) Layton was Kimmel&#x27;s Intelligence Officer.
*Robert Stinnett, &quot;Day Of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor&quot; (Free Press, 1999) A study of the Freedom of Information Act documents that led Congress to direct the military to clear Kimmel and Short&#x27;s records. Full of questionable claims, unsupported allegations, and errors of fact and reasoning. 
*L. S. Howeth, USN (Retired), &quot;History of Communications – Electronics in the United States Navy&quot;, GPO (Government Printing Office), Washington, DC, 1963. A very good source of material, especially on equipment and capabilities. Chapter XV comments on identifying transmitters by their unique &quot;tone&quot; and a Navy radio operator&#x27;s court-martial, resulting in conviction.
*Frederick D. Parker, &quot;Pearl Harbor Revisited – United States Navy Communications Intelligence 1924–1941&quot; from the Center for Cryptologic History, National Security Agency, 1944 – now available online here. Of note are the SRNs given, and there to especially highlight are, for example: (a) the clear distinction the IJN made between shortware versus longwave radio transmissions (see SRN-115397 on page 59), (b) missing paragraphs: &quot;2. Other forces at the discretion of their respective commanders.&quot; and &quot;3. Supply ships, repair ships, hospital ships, etc., will report directly to parties concerned.&quot; (see SRN-116866 on page 62).
*Mark Emerson Willey, &quot;Pearl Harbor – Mother of All Conspiracies&quot; (self-published in 1999, now available in paperback). Has a detailed timeline of events leading to Pearl Harbor, discusses codebreaking and radio silence, with Appendix A highlighting the many contextural differences as evidenced in SRH-406 – &quot;Pre-Pearl Harbor Japanese Naval Dispatches&quot;. Known for having some of the more outlandish claims. Chapter Two &quot;Japanese Navy Codes&quot; provides an excellent tutorial on &quot;hatted&quot; codes, especially JN25. [SRH-406 had several titles, an original non-censored version exits in private hands. A number of &quot;GZ&quot; comments have been removed from today&#x27;s public version. FOIA requests for this original document have been denied.]
*A. J. Barker, &quot;Pearl Harbor – Battle Book No. 10&quot; (Ballantine&#x27;s Illustrated History of World War II from 1969). An interesting approach to the sequence of events, rare photographs, having as military consultant/historian the well-known Captain Sir Basil Liddell-Hart. Claims others are mistaken as the belief of &quot;Lurline&quot;&#x27;s radioman, based on an inadequate grasp of naval communications.
*Stephen Budiansky, &quot;Battle of Wits – The Complete Story of Codebreaking in World War II&quot;, (Free Press, 2000). An account of cryptography and cryptanalysis during World War II. Uncovered a vast amount of detailed information regarding JN-25.
*Michael V. Gannon, &quot;Pearl Harbor Betrayed – The True Story of a Man and a Nation under Attack&quot; (Henry Holt and Company, 2001). Includes letter addressed to Admiral Stark by Admiral Kimmel but never sent – &quot;You betrayed the officers and men of the Fleet by not giving them a fighting chance for their lives and you betrayed the Navy in not taking responsibility for your actions; you ...&quot; Also of note, critiques claims made by R. Stinnett regarding the McCollum memo.
*Gordon W. Prange, with Donald W. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, &quot;At Dawn We Slept (1981)&quot;, &quot;Verdict of History&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor Papers&quot;, &quot;Miracle at Midway&quot; The semi-official account of Pearl Harbor by MacArthur&#x27;s historian during the Occupation. Prange had considerable official access to the Japanese immediately after the war.
*John Prados, &quot;Combined Fleet Decoded – The Secret History of American Intelligence and the Japanese Navy in World War II&quot; (Random House, 1995). Quite a lot of new information on Japanese cryptography during the War. Pages 167–172 have more on the &quot;Winds&quot; Message, and on pages 698–699 is a recounting the recovery of the &quot;Nichi&quot; papers by U.S. Navy divers from the in Manila Bay (last two photographs prior to page 423).
*Fred B. Wrixon, &quot;Codes, Ciphers &amp; Other Cryptic &amp; Clandestine Communication: Making &amp; Breaking of Secret Messages from Hieroglyphs to the Internet&quot; (Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers, 1998). An introductory account with many examples – and on page 104 and page 114, are descriptions of the 1943 BRUSA Agreement and 1947 UKUSA Agreement respectively.
*Timothy Wilford, &quot;Pearl Harbor Redefined: USN Radio Intelligence in 1941&quot;, (University Press of America, 2001); from his Masters thesis in History from the University of Ottawa – the thesis is available online (ProQuest) with additional materials not included in the book, e.g., the Appendix materials, appendices begin on page 143. Provided on page 143 is a still censored letter from Fabian to Safford from August 30, 41. Presented are also other newer materials recently declassified on radio silence, codebreaking, RFP (Radio Finger-Printing), and &quot;Fundamental Ripple&quot; displays.
*Philip H. Jacobsen &quot;Pearl Harbor: Radio Officer Leslie Grogan of the SS Lurline and his Misidentified Signals&quot; (Cryptologia April 2005) Details errors, and conflicting stories within the works of Villa, Wilford, Stinnett, Toland, and Farago. Also covers the missing report of Leslie Grogan dated December 10, 1941, titled &quot;Record for Posterity&quot; and compares this with the 26‑year‑old &quot;remembrances&quot; within Farago&#x27;s &quot;The Broken Seal&quot;. Jacobsen concludes what Grogan heard were Japanese commercial ships sending routine plain language radio messages in their specialized Kata Kana telegraphic code.
*Philip H. Jacobsen &quot;Radio Silence and Radio Deception: Secrecy Insurance for the Pearl Harbor Strike Force&quot; (Intelligence and National Security, Vol. 19, No.4 Winter 2004) Author reviews and refutes various claims of Robert Stinnett and most notably the works of Timothy Wilford regarding radio silence.

<text>Henry Asbjørn Larsen (September 30, 1899 – October 29, 1964) was a Norwegian-Canadian Arctic explorer. Larsen was born on a small island, Herføl, south of Fredrikstad in Norway. Like his hero, Roald Amundsen, he became a seaman. Larsen immigrated to Canada, and became a British subject in 1927 (Canadian citizen in 1947). In 1928, he joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

== RCMP service ==

In 1928 the RCMP commissioned for Arctic service. During its first voyage into the Arctic, Larsen served as mate under a captain that the RCMP hired, but, once in the Arctic, Larsen was appointed captain. Larsen commanded &quot;St. Roch&quot; for most of the next two decades, rising to the rank of sergeant. In the final years of Larsen&#x27;s career, he was the senior RCMP officer in the Arctic. Following his command of &quot;St. Roch&quot;, Larsen was promoted to inspector with responsibility for all Arctic detachments.
For the first 12 years that the ship was in commission, Larsen and his crew took supplies to scattered RCMP posts in Canada&#x27;s far north. &quot;St. Roch&quot; was specially constructed to be able to survive being frozen-in all winter. During the winter, the RCMP officers who formed her crew used dog sleds to turn &quot;St. Roch&quot; into a floating RCMP outpost. During this time, &quot;St. Roch&quot; was the only Canadian presence in the far north, carrying out various governmental duties.

== Exploring the Northwest Passage ==

===1940-1942: west to east===
This journey was the second ship crossing of the Northwest Passage and the first from west to east. The route was nearly the same as Roald Amundsen&#x27;s 1903 coast-hugging east–west crossing except that Larsen used the Bellot Strait. Documents found in the RCMP archives in the 1990s show that the voyage was somehow connected to a Canadian plan to occupy Greenland after the German invasion of Denmark. The Germans could have occupied the island, seized the cryolite mine and used the island as a U-boat base. The Canadian plan was blocked by the United States but Larsen&#x27;s voyage went ahead anyway. &quot;St. Roch&quot; left Vancouver in June 1940. After trouble with ice east of Point Barrow he decided to winter at Walker Bay on the west coast of Victoria Island at the entrance to Prince of Wales Strait. In July 1941 the ship was released from the ice and Larsen followed the coast east and reached Amundsen&#x27;s Gjoa Haven by the end of August. Turning north up the channel he was struck by the full force of the ice just north of King William Island. In early September he found refuge at Paisley Bay on the west coast of the Boothia Peninsula near the North Magnetic Pole. In August 1942 he forced his way out of the ice, went north and with difficulty passed the Bellot Strait. At the other end he found civilization of a sort at the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post at Fort Ross on Somerset Island. He then continued through Prince Regent Inlet, Lancaster Sound and the Davis Strait, reaching Halifax on 11 October 1942.

===1944: east to west===
This was the third ship crossing of the Northwest Passage, the second east–west crossing and the first to be made in one season (7,295 miles in 86 days). Instead of the standard route along the coast he used the Parry Channel and Prince of Wales Strait. Fitted with a more powerful engine, &quot;St. Roch&quot; left Halifax on 25 July 1944 and by 20 August was at Beechey Island. Continuing west he reached William Edward Parry&#x27;s Winter Harbour on Melville Island. As usual for explorers at this place, he tried to enter McClure Strait to the northwest and, as usual, was blocked by ice. Next he turned southwest and passed through the Prince of Wales Strait, apparently the first ship to do so . Passing Walker Bay where he had wintered four years previously, on 4 September he reached the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post at Holman Island, on the west coast of Victoria Island. Just one day before this post had been supplied by the &quot;Fort Ross&quot; which had sailed from Halifax and through the Panama Canal and Bering Strait. With about a month left before the ice would probably close in, he hurried west, passed through the Bering Strait and reached Vancouver on 16 October.

=== Larsen&#x27;s explorations and Canadian sovereignty ===
Some believe the real purpose of the voyages of discovery was not to patrol the Arctic searching for evidence of German infiltrators, but rather to protect Canadian interests from her American allies. There were difficulties in the American/Canadian alliance during World War II, manifested during the construction of the Alaska Highway.

==Legacy==
In 1946 he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Patron&#x27;s Medal for his achievements. In 1959, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society awarded him their first Massey Medal.

Larsen Sound, a body of water located in the Arctic to the west of Boothia Peninsula and north of Victoria Strait, was named for him. In 2000, as a millennium project, the RCMP renamed one of its vessels the &quot;St. Roch II&quot;, and sent it to recreate Larsen&#x27;s first voyage. The &quot;St. Roch&quot; is currently located in the Vancouver Maritime Museum, where visitors can view and board the ship. The Canadian Coast Guard also named an icebreaker to honour him.

In the Stan Rogers song &quot;Take It from Day to Day&quot; a crew member aboard &quot;St. Roch&quot; laments of how &quot;Larsen&#x27;s got us under his thumb.&quot;

There is a public elementary school in Ottawa named in his honour. It was opened in 1987.

<text>DET, also known under its chemical name &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diethyltryptamine and as T-9, is a psychedelic drug closely related to DMT and 4-HO-DET. However, despite its structural similarity to DMT, its activity is induced by an oral dose of around 50–100 mg, without the aid of MAO inhibitors, and the effects last for about 2–4 hours.

==Chemistry==
DET is an analogue of the common tryptamine hallucinogen N,N-Dimethyltryptamine or DMT.

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism of action is thought to be serotonin receptor agonism, much like other classic psychedelics.

DET is sometimes preferred over DMT because it can be taken orally, whereas DMT cannot. This is because the enzyme monoamine oxidase degrades DMT into an inactive compound before it is absorbed. To overcome this, it must be administered in a different manner, i.e. intravenously, intramuscularly, by inhalation, by insufflation, rectally, or by ingestion along with an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Because DET has ethyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom, monoamine oxidase is unable to degrade it. This is also true for many other tryptamines with larger nitrogen substituents.

==Biochemistry==
Although DET is a synthetic compound with no known natural sources, it has been used in conjunction with the mycelium of &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; to produce the synthetic chemicals 4-PO-DET (Ethocybin) and 4-HO-DET (Ethocin), as opposed to the naturally occurring 4-PO-DMT (Psilocybin) and 4-HO-DMT (Psilocin). Isolation of the alkaloids resulted in 3.3% 4-HO-DET and 0.01-0.8% 4-PO-DET.

==Psychosis model==
Early studies of DET as well as other psychedelics were focused on their presumed psychotomimetic properties. Researchers theorized that abnormal metabolites of endogenous chemicals such as tryptamine, serotonin, and tryptophan could be the explanation for mental disorders such as schizophrenia, or psychosis. With the progression of science and pharmacological understanding, this belief has been dismissed by most researchers.

==Legal status==
Internationally DET is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

===Australia===
DET is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

<text>Daniel Webster Marsh (August 15, 1838 – June 27, 1916) was a businessman and 4th mayor of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He was born in the United States, at Hudson, New Hampshire to Enoch Sawyer March and Margaret Whittier. 

Marsh spent his youth in Nashua, New Hampshire, attending the public schools, and starting his working career there. As a young man, he served with the 30th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment and was a part of the Dakota Territory Indian campaigns.

By 1876 Marsh was managing a small general store in Fort Benton, Montana, after which he joined the Fort Benton firm T. C. Power and Bro and in 1876 moved to Fort Walsh (in Saskatchewan) to manage their store, remaining at that post until 1883. As the Canadian Pacific Railway moved west, Marsh saw the opportunity to open up new stores for the company; he opened a store in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan in 1883, and opened a Calgary branch in 1884, remaining as manager of that post until 1893. He arranged for his nephew, Horace A. Greeley, to manage the store in Maple Creek.

Marsh became a prominent moneylender soon after his arrival in Calgary. In 1887 he married Julia Wood Shurtliff, the widow of North-West Mounted Police superintendent Albert Shurtliff. They had one daughter. T. C. Power and Bro. sold the Calgary store to Marsh in 1893, and he continued operating it until 1901.

Marsh served one term as mayor of the town of Calgary, winning by acclamation in the 1889 election and serving from January 21, 1889, to January 20, 1890. 

Upon his death in Calgary, his estate was appraised at $351,000. The majority of his estate was left to Julia, who died two years later.

<doc id="1130153" wikidata="Q1132236" url="?curid=1130153" title="Reform Party (New Zealand)">
<text>The Reform Party, formally the New Zealand Political Reform League, was New Zealand&#x27;s second major political party, having been founded as a conservative response to the original Liberal Party. It was in government between 1912 and 1928, and later formed a coalition with the United Party (a remnant of the Liberals), and then merged with United to form the modern National Party.

==Foundation==

The Liberal Party, founded by John Ballance and fortified by Richard Seddon, was highly dominant in New Zealand politics at the beginning of the 20th century. The conservative opposition, consisting only of independents, was disorganised and demoralised. It had no cohesive plan to counter the Liberal Party&#x27;s dominance, and could not always agree on a single leader — it was described by one historian as resembling a disparate band of guerrillas, and presented no credible threat to continued Liberal Party rule.

Gradually, however, the Liberals began to falter — the first blow came with the death of Richard Seddon, their popular leader, but other factors contributed to their decline. Importantly for conservatives, the Liberals were slowly losing support from small farmers, who had once backed the Liberals due to their promise of land reform. Having achieved the land reforms, farmers had little reason to continue their support for the Liberals, and drifted towards the socially conservative opposition. At the same time, the Liberals were also slowly losing their other base of support, the urban working class — the Ballance and Seddon governments had introduced many reformist labour laws, but under later leaders (notably Joseph Ward) the reforms had slowed. The Liberals were split between the farmers and the workers, attempting to please both and therefore satisfying neither. The attempts of the Liberals to win back the labour vote were decried by conservatives as &quot;socialistic&quot;, and the flight of farmers and businessmen from the Liberal Party was accelerated. The conservative opposition, which pledged its opposition to the alleged socialist tendencies of the Liberals, was strengthened.

The foundation of the Reform Party was closely associated with this return of the opposition to political significance, and with growing agitation against the Liberal Party&#x27;s alleged socialism. The party itself crystallised around a farmer-turned-politician named William Massey, who became the leader of most conservatives in Parliament in 1903 after serving many years prior as the conservative whip. Also closely linked to the group were the Political Reform League, Auckland&#x27;s &quot;National Association&quot;, and (in an unofficial capacity) the Farmers&#x27; Union. The opposition began referring to itself as the Reform Party in 1909, and adopted a common platform for contesting elections. Among the party&#x27;s important policy planks were farmers&#x27; freehold and the reform of the public service.

Despite campaigning heavily against the government&#x27;s &quot;socialism&quot;, it did not propose to undo the Liberal Party&#x27;s labour and welfare reforms. In 1911 a consistent theme of the Reform campaign was that it stood for &quot;true Liberalism&quot; and the Opposition accepted the permanency of the basic reforms of the Liberals in the 1890s. They claimed patronage, corruption and &quot;Tammanyism&quot; (patronage based on connections) for example in civil service appointments.

==Reform Government==

In the 1911 elections, the Reform Party won thirty-seven seats compared with thirty-three for the Liberals. Supporters of the Liberals denied that Reform had won a mandate to rule, however, pointing out that the country quota (a system in which rural electorates were smaller than urban ones, meaning that rural areas were slightly over-represented in Parliament) worked to &quot;inflate&quot; Reform&#x27;s vote. Nevertheless, it did not take long for the Liberal government, now ruling only with the support of independents, to fall. Ward resigned in 1912, and after successor Thomas Mackenzie lost a confidence vote, William Massey became Prime Minister on 10 July 1912.

In government, the Reform Party implemented many of its policies regarding freehold and public service reform. Many other Liberal-era policies were not changed, however, and Reform gained further support from disillusioned members of the Liberal Party. Reform also demonstrated its tough line against &quot;socialism&quot; with its responses to a number of notable strikes — the Waihi miners&#x27; strike, led by left-wing &quot;Red Fed&quot; unions which Massey condemned as &quot;enemies of order&quot;, was harshly suppressed, and one worker died. A dockworkers&#x27; strike in 1913 was also broken. The strikes prompted considerable concern about socialism in certain sectors of society, boosting Reform&#x27;s re-election in the 1914 elections. While the party&#x27;s share of the vote increased, Massey was disappointed that the party only won by two votes. In addition, the election was marred by allegations by both Reform and Liberals of voting irregularities in the Māori electorates. Following the outbreak of World War One, the Reform and Liberal parties formed a National Government in August 1915.

After the Liberal leader Joseph Ward rejected a Reform caucus resolution in November 1918 the two parties merge, Massey announced in May 1919 that the two parties would contest the 1919 election separately. The National Government subsequently lapsed in August 1919. During the 1919 election held on 17 December, Reform further strengthened its position, winning 47 seats (37%) of the vote. The Liberals won 19 seats while the Labour Party won eight seats.

In the 1922 elections, however, the approach of depression cost the government to lose nine seats, dropping from 47 to 38. The Liberals gained 24 seats while Labour gained 17 seats at the Reform party&#x27;s expense. In order to maintain its majority, Reform was forced to build an unstable coalition with three former Liberal Members of Parliament, who became independents. By that time, New Zealand politics had developed into a three-party system consisting of Reform, Labour and the Liberals.

In 1925, Massey died. After a period under interim leader Francis Bell, Reform chose Gordon Coates as its new leader. Coates, while not regarded as politically astute, was relatively popular with the public, and campaigned well. In the 1925 elections, Reform won a surprisingly high number of seats — 55, compared with 12 for Labour and 11 for the Liberals. This victory was not as pronounced in the statistics for the popular vote since many believed that Reform had profited from the three-party configuration, with the anti-Reform vote being split.

Coates was also unable to live up to the high expectations generated by the election result. Coates lacked the political skills needed to manage the Reform party and parliamentary caucus, and also retained several poor-performing ministers. Under Coates, the Reform Government passed the Family Allowances Act, which was unpopular with party supporters. Coates&#x27; administration was also blamed for a major drop in farm export prices in 1926. Reform also lost two by-elections in Eden and Raglan to the Labour Party, which began positioning itself as the new official opposition.

In the 1928 elections, however, there was a substantial reversal. The new United Party led by former Liberal leader Joseph Ward, founded on the ashes of the Liberal Party, experienced a surge of support. While Reform&#x27;s parliamentary presence was reduced to 28 seats, the United Party won 27 seats, Labour won 19 seats, the new Country Party gained one seat, and there were five independents. The United Party formed a new government with the support of Labor and the five independents.

==Opposition and Coalition==
The Reform Party, still led by Coates, continued in opposition. The worsening economic situation left the United Party government struggling, and in 1931, the Labour Party withdrew its support in protest at certain economic measures. Following Ward&#x27;s resignation in May 1930, George Forbes became the leader of the United Party and Prime Minister. The Reform Party reluctantly agreed to support the United Party government, as the depression had raised fears of major gains for Labour if an election were held. United and Reform established a coalition government, with United&#x27;s Forbes remaining Prime Minister but Reform&#x27;s Downie Stewart becoming Finance Minister.

In coalition, the two parties suffered only minor losses in the 1931 elections; the United-Reform Coalition government won 51 seats while Labour won 24 seats. As the depression failed to dissipate, however, the government became more and more unpopular, and support for the Labour Party soared. Clashes between Gordon Coates (who still led Reform) and Downie Stewart over economic policy eventually prompted Downie Stewart&#x27;s resignation in January 1933, earning the government a new critic and hurting its popularity still further. In addition, some of the coalition&#x27;s measures to revive the economy were condemned by some as &quot;socialist&quot; — the Democrat Party, founded to fight this &quot;socialism&quot;, cost the coalition a certain amount of support. In the 1935 general election, the coalition to suffered a massive defeat to the Labour Party, winning only 19 seats to Labour&#x27;s 53.

Shortly after losing the 1935 elections, Reform and United resolved to merge completely in 1936, creating a united front against Labour. The new group was named the National Party, and has remained Labour&#x27;s principal opponent ever since. The merged party&#x27;s first three leaders-Adam Hamilton, Sidney Holland, and Keith Holyoake—came from the Reform half of the merger.

<text>Barry Lamb (born 9 May 1963 in South Shields, England) is an English experimental musician.

==Biography==

Barry Lamb is an English composer, author and musician. He was born in South Shields, but lived in Holland-on-Sea during his secondary school years. He attended Clacton County High School where he first met his long time musical collaborator Peter Ashby. It was during his high school years that he formed Frenzid Melon with Ashby and they began experimenting with music inspired by the immediacy and DIY ethic of punk. Lamb also began making his own experimental music using simple tape manipulation techniques and they began to release their music on cassette. This marked the beginning of what has become known as cassette culture. During this period Ashby &amp; Lamb founded Falling A Records, as one of the early cassette labels and later an independent record label.

Falling A also opened a shop in Clacton-on-Sea and acted as a distribution service for other cassette culture artists, labels and fanzines. Lamb&#x27;s solo career coexisted with his collaborations with Ashby. Most of his solo albums are avant-garde / electronic / industrial in nature. The album &quot;Dusk&quot; is perhaps his best-known solo work. During his most prolific period, Lamb had regular correspondence with fellow contemporaries Bryn Jones of Muslimgauze, members of Attrition, and the Third Mind record label.

Sometime during the course of 1981–82 Frenzid Melon disbanded but Ashby and Lamb quickly re emerged having added Owen Turley to the line up and morphing into a new band the insane picnic. Whilst Frenzid Melon had been heavily influenced by punk, the insane picnic had more of a post punk feel to them. Their debut release in the autumn of 1982 was the critically acclaimed &quot;Four Days in April&quot; EP. This received a glowing review by Ian Pye in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; &quot;A twisted cross between Echo and the Bunnymen &amp; the Fall. The Insane Picnic succeed where most others fail by creating an atmosphere that may not be unique but is at least threateningly distanced from the obvious possibilities..&quot; The insane picnic were unable to capitalise on momentum due to internal struggles and the inability to engage a permanent drummer for regular live performances. A planned album in 1984 did not advance beyond the demo stage. The demo tapes were eventually released on CD in 2004 under the name &quot;this is the winter darkness&quot;. The insane picnic continued in a stop start fashion until 1989 with occasional releases and live performances. Their biggest success during this period was the &quot;Magistrates &amp; Saints&quot; 12&quot; EP. The closure of the Falling A shop in 1985 sparked the relocation of the headquarters to Reading.

In 1989 following the demise of the insane picnic, Lamb moved to Braintree, Essex and recorded a progressive rock album with Ashby under the name of Ermin Grud. The resulting album &quot;the narrow path&quot; was released as a private pressing in a deliberately obscure manner with no clues as to the source of the recording or musicians involved. There are fewer than 100 copies in existence. The album is saturated with the sound of the mellotron and Hammond organ in an attempt to pass it off as an authentic early 1970s private pressing.

In the late 1990s his output was minimal, and apart from an appearance on the WMTID album &quot;Pale Saint&quot; he seemed along with many of his cassette culture contemporaries to have disappeared without a trace. Midway through 2005 though, he re-emerged with an appearance on the Jasun Martz (former member of Frank Zappa&#x27;s band) album &quot;The Pillory / The Battle&quot; playing mellotron and wind synth as well as releasing a brand new album entitled &quot;It&#x27;s All About Purpose&quot; on the Six Armed Man label. 2006 saw another flurry of activity with several contributions to various Six Armed Man releases and another album of new material entitled &quot;Observations of Istanbul&quot;.

In 2007 he released an album of new material called &quot;...this is&quot; which has received critical acclaim in the underground music network. Lamb&#x27;s continued partnership with former insane picnic and Frenzid Melon member Peter Ashby continues to bear fruit as they work together. Other collaborations include Lamb playing saxophone on Peter Ashby&#x27;s &quot;Disturbances in the ether&quot; album, working with up and coming urban hip hop artist Tor Cesay, collaborating with Keith Levene, being covered by Swiss chanteuse Hilda Garman and recording with Wavis O&#x27;Shave.

Following another hiatus in 2016, the Ashby &amp; Lamb partnership reconvened under the name of The Two Headed Emperor. This resulted in another flurry of new releases and activity.

In 2020, he headed up a team that curated and delivered the 40th anniversary release of Morgan Fisher&#x27;s influential &quot;Miniatures&quot; series. The subsequent album contained tracks from many well known artists including some from the original 1980 album and its millennial sequel as well as a selection of lesser known musicians. &quot;Wire Magazine&quot; reviewed it as &quot;musically tight and conceptually svelte, like a sonic haiku. Limiting tracks to one minute leads to an economy and urgency that is completely engaging&quot;.

<text>Langton Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Bootle, connected to Alexandra Dock to the north and Brocklebank Dock to the south. Langton Dock locks provide a working connection to the river; one of the two remaining operational river entrances in the northern dock system.

==History==
The dock was built by George Fosbery Lyster, and officially opened along with Alexandra Dock in 1881. The dock had been partially in use since 1879. It was named after William Langton, a member of the dock committee, and a former chairman of the Bank of Liverpool. As originally built, Langton Dock consisted of a basin adjoining the river wall, with a branch dock and two graving docks to the east. Access from the river was initially via Canada Basin.

The dock was intended for very large vessels of the time and was used for trading in the Mediterranean. Shipping companies, which used the dock, included Ellerman Lines and John Glynn.

Subsequent modifications were made to Langton Dock and the surrounding basins during the twentieth century to improve access. Between 1949-62, this included the construction of the Langton River Entrance, which was eventually opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 December 1962, after being delayed by a series of problems.

The branch dock and graving docks were filled in, providing parking spaces for vehicles using the former Brocklebank Dock ferry terminal to Belfast, Northern Ireland. On the closure of the Pier Head&#x27;s Princes Landing Stage, the remaining dock basin was occasionally used as terminal for the start of cruises, accommodating cruise ships. However, since the opening of the Liverpool cruise liner terminal in 2013, Langton Dock has ceased to berth cruise liners.

The Langton Dock Pump House is on the Victorian Society&#x27;s list of endangered buildings. The Pump House provided hydraulic power for the dock complex, and maintained water levels within the docks. 

In common with some other Liverpool docks, Langton provided dockside accommodation for employees. An octagonal compound, containing seven separate houses built around a central courtyard, was built close to the narrower lock from Canada Basin into Langton Dock. Named Langton Buildings, it enabled key staff to be on hand at any time. There was also a staff flat upstairs in the Pump House.

<doc id="1130176" wikidata="Q1536686" url="?curid=1130176" title="Battle of Sunda Strait">
<text>The Battle of Sunda Strait was a naval battle which occurred during World War II in the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java, and Sumatra. On the night of 28 February 1 March 1942, the Australian light cruiser , American heavy cruiser , and Dutch destroyer faced a major Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) task force. After a fierce battle lasting several hours, all Allied ships were sunk. Five Japanese ships were sunk, three of them by friendly fire.

==Background==

In late February 1942, Japanese amphibious forces were preparing to invade Java, in the Dutch East Indies. On 27 February, the main American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) naval force, under Admiral Karel Doorman–a Dutch officer–steamed northeast from Surabaya to intercept an Imperial Japanese navy invasion fleet. This part of the ABDA force consisted of two heavy cruisers, including under the command of Captain Albert H. Rooks, three light cruisers, including under Captain Hector Waller, and nine destroyers. Only six out of nine of USS &quot;Houston&quot;″s heavy guns were operational because her aft gun turret had been knocked out in an earlier Japanese air raid. The force engaged the Japanese force in the Battle of the Java Sea. The Allied ships were all sunk or dispersed. &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot; both retreated to Tanjung Priok, Java, the main port of Batavia, Dutch East Indies, where they arrived at 13:30 on 28 February.

==Prelude==
In the early evening on 28 February, &quot;Houston&quot;, &quot;Perth&quot; and the Dutch destroyer received orders to depart Tanjung Priok and head through Sunda Strait to Tjilatjap, on the south coast of Java. Waller, who had seniority, was de facto commander of this force. The only ships they expected to encounter were Australian corvettes on patrol, in and around the strait itself. While &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot; left at 19:00, &quot;Evertsen&quot; was not ready and followed the cruisers two hours later.

By chance, just after 22:00, a Japanese invasion convoy bound for West Java including the entire Sixteenth Army, under Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura, in over 50 transport ships was entering Bantam Bay, near the northwest tip of Java. The Japanese troop transports were escorted by the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, led by Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara, and the 7th Cruiser Division, under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita. Light cruiser (with Admiral Hara aboard), with the destroyers , , , , , , , and were closest to the convoy. Flanking the bay to the north were the heavy cruisers and , accompanied by the destroyer .

Slightly further north, though not involved in the action, was the aircraft carrier , with the heavy cruisers and (with Admiral Kurita aboard), along with the seaplane tender , and the destroyers and .

Some time around 23:15, the Allied ships were sighted by the patrolling &quot;Fubuki&quot;, which followed them surreptitiously. At 23:06, when they were about halfway across the mouth of Bantam Bay, &quot;Perth&quot; sighted a ship about ahead, near Saint Nicolaas Point. It was thought at first that the ship was an Australian corvette, but when challenged, she made an unintelligible reply, with a lamp which was the wrong color, fired her nine Long Lance (Type 93) torpedoes from about and then turned away, making smoke. The ship was soon identified as a Japanese destroyer (probably &quot;Harukaze&quot;). Waller reported the contact and ordered his forward turrets to open fire.

==Main action==

During a ferocious night action, the Allied cruisers were surrounded. The cruisers opened fire on the transports in their way as they diverted to the west. Their intended path was blocked so they went west then north west. However the return to Java Sea was now blocked by the heavy cruisers. Following severe damage from torpedo and shell impacts, &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot; were abandoned after midnight and sank.

About four Japanese transports and the minesweeper &quot;W-2&quot; were sunk by friendly torpedoes that had missed their target. (Two of these transports were later refloated.) One of the Japanese transports sunk was &quot;Ryujo Maru&quot;, carrying Lieutenant General Imamura, who had to jump overboard. He was later rescued by the crew of a small boat and taken ashore.

== Destroyer action ==

Meanwhile, as &quot;Evertsen&quot; was trying to catch up with &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Perth&quot;, her crew spotted the tracers and intense shellfire of the main action. Her captain ordered a course northwest towards Pulau Mundu island, off the east coast of Sumatra, then hugged the Sumatran coast as &quot;Evertsen&quot; turned south to head through Sunda Strait.

However, &quot;Evertsen&quot; was spotted by &quot;Murakumo&quot; and &quot;Shirakumo&quot;, looking for more escaping Allied ships. Both immediately illuminated &quot;Evertsen&quot; with their searchlights and took her under fire. &quot;Evertsen&quot; attempted to evade by turning west, but after turning southward again, the Dutch destroyer again encountered the Japanese destroyers. &quot;Evertsen&quot; was hit repeatedly, but temporarily disengaged under a smokescreen. By then, however, &quot;Evertsen&quot;″s stern was on fire. Still taking Japanese fire, the captain ordered his crew to ground &quot;Evertsen&quot; on a coastal reef. Firing all her torpedoes, the remaining crew escaped ashore before the fire reached the aft magazine, causing an explosion that blew off most of the stern.

==Aftermath==

Officially the Allied personnel killed during the battle included 696 members of the crew of &quot;Houston&quot; and 375 from &quot;Perth&quot;, including the captains of both vessels, Rooks and Waller. The survivors were picked up by Japanese vessels and taken prisoner, included 368 from &quot;Houston&quot; and 307 from &quot;Perth&quot;. Rooks was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. The majority of &quot;Evertsen&quot;″s crew was taken prisoner on 9–10 March 1942 and were held by the Japanese for three and a half years.

The crew of the Japanese cruiser &quot;Mikuma&quot; suffered six killed and 11 wounded, as a result of damage caused by &quot;Houston&quot;. A direct shell hit to the bridge of the destroyer &quot;Shirayuki&quot; killed one crew member and wounded 11; &quot;Harukaze&quot; suffered hits to her bridge, engine room and rudder, killing three and wounding more than 15 others.

<text>Brocklebank Dock is a dock on the River Mersey, England, and part of the Port of Liverpool. It is situated in the northern dock system in Bootle, connected to Langton Dock to the north and Canada Dock to the south. Carriers&#x27; Dock was originally sited to the east.

==History==
Known as Canada Half Tide Dock when opened in 1862, it had two branch docks to the east which were known as North and South Carriers&#x27; Docks. Timber was initially the principal cargo, with fire a consequent safety concern. The original river entrance presented navigational difficulties, with the area affected by silting. The dock was renamed in 1879 in honour of Ralph Brocklebank, Chairman of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board between 1863 and 1869. 

By the 1920s, the dock was home to the Houlder Brothers shipping company which operated to South America, and to the Commonwealth Line which operated to Australia.

Subsequent modifications were made to Brocklebank Dock and the surrounding basins during the twentieth century, including the new Langton River Entrance in 1958.

Brocklebank Dock provided facilities for transporting passengers and freight between Liverpool and Belfast, in Northern Ireland, until it was superseded by the Twelve Quays ferry terminal at Birkenhead.

<text>The Boeing B-29 Superfortress is a United States Army Air Forces long range, strategic heavy bomber that was produced in many experimental and production models from 1943 to 1946.

==XB-29==
: &quot;Section source: Baugher&quot;

The XB-29, Boeing Model 345, was the first accepted prototype or experimental model delivered to the Army Air Corps, incorporating a number of improvements on the design originally submitted, including more and larger guns and self-sealing fuel tanks. Two aircraft were ordered in August 1940, and a third was ordered in December. A mockup was completed in the spring of 1941, and it first flew on September 21, 1942.

Testing was conducted on the XB-29 until February 18, 1943, when the second prototype crashed. The flight was conducted by Boeing&#x27;s chief test pilot, Edmund T. &quot;Eddie&quot; Allen on a two-hour powerplant performance test. The accident happened when leaking fuel from a filler cap in the wing leading edge ran down inside the leading-edge and ignited. The fire spread to the engines, and due to the much reduced power, the aircraft, unable to climb, crashed into the Frye meat-packing plant. The crash demolished the majority of the packing plant and killed all eleven XB-29 crew, 22 employees at the plant, and one fireman. Many leading Boeing personnel involved in the design perished in the accident; the pilot, Allen, was chief of the Research Division. After the crash, the United States Army Air Forces and a congressional committee headed by then-Senator Harry S. Truman investigated the B-29 program, issuing a scathing report, prompting the Army Air Forces to take control of the program.

==YB-29==

The YB-29 was an improved XB-29 and 14 were built for service testing. Testing began in the summer of 1943, and dozens of modifications were made to the planes. The engines were upgraded from Wright R-3350-13s to R-3350-21s. Where the XB-29 had three-bladed props, the YB-29 had four-bladed propellers. Various alternatives to the remote-controlled defensive systems were tested on a number of them, particularly the fourth one delivered. After alternative arrangements had been fully tested, defensive armament was standardised at ten .50-calibre machine guns in turret-mounted pairs. The YB-29 also featured a better fire control system.

==B-29==
The B-29 was the original production version of the Superfortress. Since the new bomber was urgently needed, the production design was developed in tandem with the service testing. In fact, the first B-29 was completed only two months after the delivery of the first YB-29. Forty-six B-29s of this variant, built by the Glenn L. Martin Company at its Omaha plant, were used as the aircraft for the atomic bomb missions, modified to Silverplate specifications.

Some 2,513 B-29s were manufactured by Boeing-Wichita (1,620), Bell-Atlanta (357), and Martin-Omaha (536).

==B-29A==
: &quot;Section source: Baugher&quot;

The B-29A was an improved version of the original B-29 production model. This is the definitive wartime variant of the B-29. All 1,119 B-29A&#x27;s were built at the Boeing plant in Renton, Washington, formerly used by the United States Navy.

Enhancements made in the B-29A included a better wing design and defensive modifications. Due to a demonstrated weakness to head-on fighter attacks, the number of machine guns in the forward dorsal turrets was doubled to four beginning with production block 20. Where the wings of previous models had been made by the sub-assembly of two sections, the B-29A wing was built up from three. This made construction easier, and increased the strength of the airframe. The B-29A was produced until May 1946, when the last aircraft was completed. It was employed up to, and through, the Korean War, after which it was then quickly phased out when the B-47 Stratojet became operational.

Washington B Mk 1 – This was the service name given to 88 B-29As supplied to the Royal Air Force.

==B-29B==

:&quot;Section source: Baugher&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; &amp; National Museum of the USAF
The B-29B was a modification used for low-level raids, designed with the intent of firebombing Japan. Since fighter opposition was minimal over Japan in late 1944, many of the Army Air Force leadership — most notably Curtis LeMay, commander of the XXI Bomber Command — felt that a (lighter) faster bomber would better evade Japanese flak.

In the B-29B, as with the atomic raid-dedicated &quot;Silverplate&quot; versions earlier, all defensive armament was removed except for that in the tail turret. Initially the armament was two .50 in AN/M2 machine guns and one 20 mm M2 cannon which was soon changed to three .50 in AN/M2s. The weight saved by removing the guns increased the top speed from 357 mph to 364 mph (575 km/h to 586 km/h).

Also incorporated on this version was an improved APQ-7 &quot;Eagle&quot; bombing-through-overcast radar that was fitted in an airfoil-shaped radome under the fuselage.

All 311 B-29Bs were built at the Bell plant in Marietta, Georgia (&quot;Bell-Atlanta&quot;).

==B-29C==
The B-29C was a modification of the B-29A re-engined with improved Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone engines. The Army Air Force originally ordered 5,000, but cancelled its request when World War II ended and none were built.

==B-29D (XB-44)==
:&quot;Section source: Baugher&quot;
The B-29D was an improved version of the original B-29 design, featuring 28-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-35 &quot;Wasp Major&quot; engines of 3500 hp (2600 kW) each — nearly 60% more powerful than the usual &quot;Duplex-Cyclone&quot;. It also had a taller vertical stabilizer and a strengthened wing. The XB-44 was the testbed designation for the D model.

When World War II ended, the B-29D was given the quartet of Wasp Major engines to become the B-50, which served throughout the 1950s in the U.S. bomber fleet.

==Test beds==
A number of B-29s were converted to serve as test beds for new systems. These all received variant designation, even though many existed only as a single converted aircraft.

===XB-29E===
The XB-29E for fire-control systems (one converted) was a model B-29-45-BW.

===XB-29F===
The B-29F for cold-weather operation in Alaska were six converted B-29-BWs.

===XB-29G===
The B-29 was used in the development of jet engines. Stripped of armament, a converted B-29B-55-BA (44-84043)(Bell) designated the XB-29G carried experimental jet engines in its bomb bay, which were extended into the airstream for testing during flight. This plane was used to test the Allison J35, General Electric J47 and J73 jet engines.

===XB-29H===
The XB-29H to test armament configurations was a converted B-29A.

===YB-29J, YKB-29J, RB-29J===
Experimentation in piston engines continued. Six B-29s (redesignated YB-29J) of various designation were upgraded to R-3350-79 engines. Other engine-associated items were also upgraded, including new Curtiss propellers, and &#x27;Andy Gump&#x27; cowlings, in which the oil coolers have separate air intakes. Two were later converted to aerial refueling tanker prototypes, and redesignated YKB-29J. The remainder were used for reconnaissance, and designated RB-29J.

==KB-29 Tanker Development==
==EB-29==
:&quot;Section source: Baugher&quot;
The EB-29 (E stands for exempt), was used as a carrier aircraft in which the bomb bay was modified to accept and launch experimental aircraft. They were converted in the years following World War II. One EB-29 was converted to carry the famous Bell X-1 until it was replaced by a B-50. Another was used to carry and test the XF-85 &#x27;parasite fighter&#x27;. This fighter was intended to be carried by the Convair B-36 on long-range missions to protect it from Soviet fighters. Another EB-29 was used to carry two EF-84B Thunderjet fighters as part of Project Tom-Tom. All three Tom-Tom aircraft (the B-29 and the two jet fighters) and their crews were lost in a crash on April 24, 1953.

==RB-29J (RB-29, FB-29J, F-13, F-13A)==
: &quot;Section source: see Baugher&quot;
Early B-29/B-29As that were modified for photo reconnaissance carried the F-13/F-13A designations, with &quot;F&quot; meaning &#x27;photo&#x27;. The aircraft (118 modified B-29BWs and B-29As) carried three K-17B, two K-22 and one K-18 cameras. Between the end of World War II (1945) and 1948 the designation was changed to FB-29J. In 1948, the F-13/FB-29s were redesignated RB-29 and RB-29A.

Six B-29A/F-13As were modified with the Wright R-3350-CA-2 fuel injected engines and designated at YB-29Js. These were then converted to RB-29Js.

In January 1949, RB-29s were assigned to the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and moved to Yokota AB, Japan in December 1950; to provide support to the Korean War and attached to the 15th Air Force, Far East Air Force.

==SB-29==
:&quot;Section source: Birdsall&quot;
The SB-29 &#x27;Super Dumbo&#x27; was a version of the B-29 adapted for air-sea rescue duty after World War II. Sixteen B-29s were modified to carry a droppable A-3 lifeboat under the fuselage; redesignated SB-29, they were used mainly as rescue support for air units that flew long distances over water. The first SB-29s were received by the Air Rescue Service in February 1947. With the exception of the forward lower gun turret, all defensive armament was retained; the aircraft additionally carried a variety of radio equipment, provisions, survival kits, and extra crew. The SB-29 was used operationally throughout the Korean War into the mid-1950s. It received its nickname from &quot;Dumbo&quot;, the Disney character, whose name was given to the aircraft used in previous missions to pick airmen up when they crashed at sea.

==TB-29==

The TB-29 was a trainer conversion of B-29 used to train crew for bombing missions; some were also used to tow targets, and the designation included B-29s modified solely for that purpose. Their most important role was serving as radar targets in the 1950s when the United States Air Force was developing intercept tactics for its fighters.

==WB-29==
The WB-29s were production aircraft modified to perform weather monitoring missions. An observation position was fitted above the central fuselage section. They conducted standard data-gathering flights, including from the UK over the Atlantic. They were also used to fly into the eye of a hurricane or typhoon to gather information. Following nuclear weapons tests, some WB-29s used air sampling scoops to test radiation levels. On 3 September 1949, a WB-29 returning from Yokota AB, Japan, to Eielson AFB, Alaska, recovered radioactive debris in air sampling scoops from the cloud generated by the first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union on 29 August.

==Airborne Early Warning==
In 1951, three B-29s were modified for use in the Airborne Early Warning program. The upper section of the forward fuselage was extensively modified to house an AN/APS-20C search radar, and the interior was modified to house radar and Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) equipment. This development led to production radar picket aircraft, including the EC-121 Warning Star. (×3, converted)

A Soviet-built copy of the B-29, the Tu-4, was used as the platform for a Chinese experimental airborne early warning aircraft, the KJ-1 AEWC, in the 1970s.

==MX-767 Banshee==
A study for the conversion of B-29s to long-range cruise missiles was conducted by the Air Materiel Command between 1946 and 1950; given the designation MX-767, it was given the codename Project Banshee. Flight tests were conducted, however no full conversions were carried out before the project was abandoned.

==Navy P2B patrol bomber==
:&quot;Section source: Baugher&quot;
The U.S. Navy acquired four B-29-BWs from the U.S. Army Air Forces on March 14, 1947. These aircraft were modified for long-range patrol missions and given the designation P2B-1S with Navy Bureau Numbers (BuNo) 84028, 84029, 84030 and 84031.

BuNo 84029, previously AAF Ser. No. 45-21787, was modified to carry the Navy&#x27;s Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket high-speed research aircraft. The bomb bay was modified to carry the Skyrocket II under the belly and drop for supersonic speed testing. The first Skyrocket test flight occurred on September 8, 1950, with test pilot William B. Bridgeman, and George Jansen flying the B-29. Scott Crossfield later broke Mach 2 flying the Skyrocket on November 20, 1953; the last Skyrocket flight was in December 1956.

The P2B-1S &quot;mother-ship&quot; was nicknamed &quot;Fertile Myrtle&quot; and was assigned the NACA number 137. As of May 2013, this aircraft was in the collection of Kermit Weeks at his Fantasy of Flight aviation museum in Polk City, Florida. The forward fuselage section was restored and briefly displayed at the Florida Air Museum in Lakeland, Florida. It has since been relocated to Fantasy of Flight&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hill&quot; storage facility along with the remainder of the disassembled aircraft, awaiting future restoration to flyable status.

BuNo 84030 and 84031 were later modified into anti-submarine patrol bombers and redesignated P2B-2S.

==XB-39 Superfortress==
: &quot;Section source: see Baugher&quot;
The XB-39 Superfortress was a single YB-29 modified to use water-cooled Allison V-3420-17 Vee type engines. Since the Army Air Force was concerned that problems might develop with their first choice of engine, the Wright R-3350, they contracted General Motors to test a modified aircraft to show that it could still be used if the R-3350 development was not successful. Since the R-3350 did not have significant enough problems to prevent its use, no XB-39s were ordered.

==Tupolev Tu-4==


In 1945, three B-29s were forced to land in Soviet territory after a bombing raid on Japan because of lack of fuel. Since the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan at the time, the aircraft and crew were interned. Eventually, the B-29 crew members were returned, but the aircraft remained in Russian hands. Seeking a modern long-range bomber, Joseph Stalin ordered the Tupolev OKB to reverse-engineer the Superfortress.

The resulting aircraft first flew on May 19, 1947, and immediately began series production, totalling 847 Tu-4s. Although largely identical in appearance to American B-29s, the Tu-4 (NATO reporting name: &quot;Bull&quot;) had Soviet-designed defensive guns and had been re-engineered to suit production using material of metric thicknesses, resulting in an aircraft that was slightly heavier and slower than the B-29. The Tu-4 presented a significant leap forward in Soviet strategic bombing. Not only did the Soviet Air Forces have the means to deliver nuclear weapons, but the Tu-4 had sufficient range to reach the United States on a one-way trip. On October 18, 1951, a Tu-4 was used in the first air-drop test of a Soviet atomic bomb.

The Tu-4 had been phased out of Soviet service by the early 1960s, being replaced by more modern aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-95. Although the Tu-4 had never delivered any explosive payload with offensive intent, it influenced Soviet aircraft technology, particularly airframe construction and onboard systems. Advanced transport and bomber variants of the Tu-4 design such as the Tu-70, Tu-75, Tu-80, and Tu-85, were developed and built, but none of these achieved series production.

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force of China attempted to use the Tu-4 airframe in the KJ-1 AWACS aircraft.

<text>Thomas Charles Power (May 22, 1839February 16, 1923) was a Republican senator from Montana and an American businessman.

==Early life, education, and career==

Born near Dubuque, Iowa, on May 22, 1839, Power attended public school and graduated from Sinsinawa College with a degree in engineering. He then worked as a surveyor in Dakota until 1860, when he entered the employ of an engineering company. There, he participated in government land surveys covering much of Iowa and what was then the Dakota Territory. Between 1861 and 1867, he was primarily engaged in trade along the Mississippi River, eventually becoming president of a steamer line. Power first came to Montana in 1864, partnering in his enterprises with his brother, J.W. Power. After settling in Helena in 1876, Power started T. C. Power and Bro, which was a mercantile company through the northwestern United States and western Canada.

==Senate service and later life==

In 1889, Power ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Montana, winning the nomination of the Republican Party on the first ballot, but losing the general election to Democratic candidate Joseph Toole, the only Democrat on the state ticket that year to be elected. A conflict erupted over the respective roles of the governor and the state legislature in appointing the first two members of the United States Senate for the state, but on January 2, 1890, the Republican-controlled legislature elected Power to the second seat, which he then held until March 3, 1895.

Power died at his home in Helena on February 16, 1923, and was interred in Resurrection Cemetery. The town of Power in Montana is named after him.

<text>Albert Oliver Jr. (born October 14, 1946) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder and first baseman from through , most notably as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates teams that won five National League Eastern Division titles in six years between and and, won the World Series in . A seven-time All-Star, Oliver was the National League batting champion and RBI champion as a member of the Montreal Expos. He surpassed the .300 batting average mark eleven times during his playing career and was also a three-time Silver Slugger Award winner.

After playing for the Pirates, he played for the Texas Rangers (–), Montreal Expos (–), San Francisco Giants (), Philadelphia Phillies (), Los Angeles Dodgers (), and Toronto Blue Jays (), over the course of his 18-year MLB career. Nicknamed &quot;Scoop&quot;, Oliver batted and threw left-handed.

==Pittsburgh Pirates==
Oliver attended Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, Ohio where he was teammates with future Major Leaguer Larry Hisle. Oliver was a star basketball player and earned a scholarship to play college basketball for the Kent State Golden Flashes men&#x27;s basketball team. However, before beginning college in 1964, he attended a tryout camp for the Philadelphia Phillies and one for the Pittsburgh Pirates in Salem, Virginia. His father, who wanted him to attend college, allowed him to sign with the Pirates at 17 years old for $5,000.

He was promoted to the Major Leagues on September 14, 1968, which was the day his father, Al Oliver Sr., died. He appeared in 4 games that season. In his official rookie season, Oliver batted .285 with 17 home runs and drove in 70 runs, placing second in the National League Rookie of the Year voting. The following season, 1970, Oliver hit .270 and was fifth in the NL with seven sacrifice flies. He also finished second in the league with the 14 times he was hit by a pitch (the previous year he was plunked 12 times, fourth in the league). The Pirates won the National League East title for their first trip to the postseason since winning the 1960 World Series. However, they lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the 1970 National League Championship Series.

On September 1, , the Pirates fielded what is believed to be the first all-black lineup in the history of the league. Oliver played first base, joining second baseman Rennie Stennett, center fielder Gene Clines, right fielder Roberto Clemente, left fielder Willie Stargell, catcher Manny Sanguillén, third baseman Dave Cash, shortstop Jackie Hernández and pitcher Dock Ellis in the starting lineup. Oliver ended the season with a .282 average, including 31 doubles (8th in the NL), seven triples (10th), 10 sacrifice flies (2nd), and five hit-by-pitches (good for 9th in the league). After beating the San Francisco Giants in the 1971 National League Championship Series, the Pirates won the World Series, beating the Baltimore Orioles in seven games with Oliver as their regular center fielder.
In , Oliver raised his batting average to .312, good for sixth in the league. He hit 12 home runs with 89 RBI (10th in the NL). He scored 88 runs (8th in the league) and totalled 176 hits, which was also 8th in the NL. Oliver was named to his first All-Star game while finishing seventh in the NL MVP voting. In 1973, Oliver hit 20 home runs and drove in 99 runs (7th in the NL) while batting .292. Again he was among the league-leaders in hits (191, fifth in the NL), total bases (303, fifth in NL), doubles (38, second in NL), triples (7, eighth in NL), sacrifice flies (nine, 3rd in NL) and extra-base hits with 65, which put him in the top ten for the first of his five times in the league&#x27;s top ten in that category. The Pirates won their third consecutive NL East title, however, they lost to the Reds 3 games to 2 in the NLCS. The Pirates offense led the National League in batting average with a .274 average and led the NL with 1505 hits.

In , Oliver hit .321 with 198 hits, which were second and fourth in the National League respectively. He also hit 38 doubles and 12 triples, which were both second best in the NL. Oliver was seventh in NL MVP voting for the second time in three years. About Oliver, Willie Stargell said, &quot;When it came to hitting ... all he ever did was crush the ball. Al was the perfect number three hitter because you knew he was going to make contact&quot;. He had a 23-game hitting streak in 1974 and another streak of 21 games where he got at least one hit. The Pirates won the NL East but lost to the Dodgers 3 games to 1 in the NLCS. The Pirates offense, known as the &quot;Pittsburgh Lumber Company&quot; again led the NL in hitting with 1560 hits and a .274 team batting average.

Oliver&#x27;s 90 runs in 1975 was tenth in the NL as he hit .280 with 18 home runs and 84 RBI and played in the All-Star game for the second time. He tied a personal mark with 65 extra base hits, which was good for 5th in the NL, 39 of which were doubles, which put him third in the NL in that category. He was named as an outfielder on The Sporting News 1975 NL All-Star Team. The Pirates won the NL East again, but were swept by the Cincinnati Reds 3 games to none in the NLCS.
In Oliver hit .323; this was his first of nine straight .300+ seasons. He played in the All-Star game once again, batting .360 at the break, but an inner ear infection sidelined him in the second half, and prevented him from finishing in the top 10 in batting categories. He was voted the National League Player of the Month for June. In 1977, as part of the so-called &quot;Pittsburgh Lumber Company&quot;, Oliver hit .308 (tenth in the NL) with 19 home runs and 82 RBI. His 175 hits were 10th in the NL. He also stole a career-high 13 bases, although he was thrown out 16 times along the way. His 8 sacrifice flies were fifth in the league as well.

==Texas Rangers==
Oliver was traded along with Nelson Norman from the Pirates to the Rangers in the first four-team blockbuster deal in Major League Baseball history on December 8, 1977, that also involved the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and a total of eleven players changing teams. The Rangers also received Jon Matlack from the Mets. The Pirates acquired Bert Blyleven from the Rangers and John Milner from the Mets. Going to the Braves from the Rangers were Adrian Devine, Tommy Boggs and Eddie Miller. The Mets got from the Braves Willie Montañez and from the Rangers Tom Grieve and Ken Henderson who was sent to New York to complete the transaction three months later on March 15, 1978.

In 1978 Oliver was second in the AL with a .324 batting average, and his 170 hits were good for eighth in the league, and his 35 doubles were sixth in the league. The next season, 1979, Oliver hit .323, good for fifth in the league (the fifth time he had finished among his league&#x27;s top ten in batting).

Wearing the number 0 on his uniform (being the first player in the major leagues to do so,) Oliver played in all of Texas&#x27;s 163 games in , and reached career highs in hits (209, fourth in the AL), doubles (43, second in the AL) and RBI (117, fourth in the AL) while batting .319, which was eighth in the American League. He was voted to the AL All-Star team for the first time. Oliver was the outfielder on The Sporting News 1980 AL Silver Slugger Team. On August 17 at Tiger Stadium, he established an American League record with 21 total bases in a doubleheader (four home runs, a double and a triple).

On May 23, 1979, and August 17, 1980, Oliver hit 3 home runs in each game, the first against the Minnesota Twins in a 7–2 win and a year later against the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader in a 12–6 victory.(He added another in the 1st game, to make it 4 in the double header. In between games, the Tigers&#x27; retired Al Kaline&#x27;s #6)

In 1981 Oliver was ninth in the AL with a .309 average, sixth in hits with 130, and second in doubles with 29, while playing in the All-Star game (his fifth). He also won his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award as the best hitter at his position, which in 1981 was designated hitter. He became the first player to win Silver Slugger Awards at two different positions. He also became the Rangers&#x27; all-time leading hitter (.319) and reached the club&#x27;s top ten in virtually every offensive category.

==Montreal Expos==
Oliver wanted an extension to his contract of which he was paid $320,000 annually and had four years remaining, but asked to be traded after Rangers management rejected his renegotiation request. He was set to be dealt to the New York Yankees for Oscar Gamble, Bob Watson and Mike Morgan prior to the 1982 regular season. Gamble, whose contract had a list of eight teams to which he can be traded which did not include the Rangers, squashed the deal. Oliver was sent to the Montreal Expos for Larry Parrish and Dave Hostetler on March 31, 1982, instead. He became the Expos&#x27; starting first baseman.

In 1982 with the Expos, Oliver hit a career-high .331 batting average to win the National League batting crown. He also led the NL in hits (204), doubles (43), extra bases (67), and total bases (317), and tied with Dale Murphy for the RBI lead with 109. His 43 doubles tied his 1980 career-high, and his 67 extra base hits was also a career-high as well as his 22 home runs, breaking his 1973 personal best. In addition to playing in his sixth All-Star game, he was third in the NL MVP voting and won his third consecutive Silver Slugger Award, this time as a first baseman. He was also the first baseman on The Sporting News&#x27; NL All-Star Team. He was voted the Montreal Expos Player of the Year at the end of the season.

In 1983 Oliver led the NL in doubles with 38 and was fourth in the NL in hits with 184. He hit .300 once again and topped the 2500 career hit level (August 10, 1983, off Mets&#x27; pitcher Carlos Diaz). and Oliver was selected for his seventh All-Star game, starting at first base in the 1983 Classic.

==Giants, Phillies, Dodgers, and Blue Jays (1984–85)==
On February 27, 1984, Oliver was traded to the San Francisco Giants for Fred Breining and Max Venable. The San Francisco Giants later sent Andy McGaffigan to the Montreal Expos to complete the trade. Later that same year, on August 20, 1984, he was again traded, this time with Renie Martin to the Philadelphia Phillies for Kelly Downs and George Riley.

In the offseason, Oliver was traded by the Phillies to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Pat Zachry. Then, on July 9, 1985, he was traded by the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Toronto Blue Jays for Len Matuszek. With the Blue Jays, Oliver delivered two game-winning hits in the first four games of the 1985 American League Championship Series against Kansas City. However, the Royals rallied to win the last three games. In the seventh and deciding game, the lefty Oliver started as the DH against right-hander Bret Saberhagen. But after pitching three scoreless innings, Saberhagen departed the game in favor of lefty Charlie Leibrandt, thus giving the Royals the platoon advantage. Right-handed batter Cliff Johnson pinch hit for Oliver, and struck out, ending a Blue Jays rally. Oliver was caught by TV cameras angrily scowling in the dugout, knowing his night—and as it turned out, his season and career—were over. Oliver batted .375 for the series. He is one of the few players to play both major league Canadian teams, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos.

Oliver claims that he was forced to retire due to collusion. Courts ruled that there was collusion among baseball owners in the mid-1980s, which included Oliver (and nine others) when a judge ruled that he was entitled to $680,031.05 in 1995.

Several players, including Kirk Gibson, were allowed to file for free agency a second time because of the court order based on the &quot;collusion&quot; finding. Oliver himself believes that he could have played four or five more years. Andre Dawson said, &quot;Al, as a lifetime .300 hitter after 18 seasons, I feel is deserving of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. There is no question in my mind had he not been forced out of the game by collusion, had he been given an all-out honest attempt to achieve 3,000 hits, he would have done it. He was pushed out of the game when he was still a .300 hitter. I feel he deserves a place in baseball today.&quot;

==Career stats==

Oliver batted .300 or more eleven times. His 2,743 career hits rank 58th on the all-time list. He also ranks among all-time top 50 in games played (2368), total bases (4083), RBI (1326) and extra-base hits (825). He was among the league&#x27;s top ten in doubles nine times and among the league&#x27;s top ten in hits nine times as well and finished in the top ten in batting average nine times. Five times he was among the league&#x27;s top ten in total bases and four times he was in the top ten in RBIs. Because of these feats, his name has been mentioned more than once as a possible inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Oliver hit the last home run at Forbes Field. His shot came off Milt Pappas in the sixth inning of the last game played at the stadium, the second game of a June 28, 1970, doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs. He also drove in the first run ever scored at Three Rivers Stadium. His first-inning double off Gary Nolan drove in Richie Hebner in that stadium&#x27;s inaugural game, on July 16 of that same 1970 season. However, the Cincinnati Reds defeated the Pirates 3–2 .

==Personal life==
His son, Aaron Oliver, played football for the Texas A&amp;M University team that won the 1998 Big 12 Conference Championship. Aaron, a four-year letterman and three-year starter, caught the first touchdown pass in Big 12 history.

On April 22, 2013, the Portsmouth City Council unanimously passed a resolution recognizing and appointing Al Oliver as &quot;Mr. Ambassador&quot; for the City of Portsmouth in recognition of his various efforts on behalf of the community and southern Ohio.

Oliver is portrayed on one of the Floodwall Murals in Portsmouth, Ohio, honoring local Major League Baseball players, scouts, and umpires.

In September 2014, Oliver released his second book, titled &quot;Life is a Hit, Don&#x27;t Strike Out&quot; that chronicled his life and career.

<text>Nonie Darwish (; born Nahid Darwish, 1949) is an Egyptian-American author, writer, founder of the Arabs for Israel movement, and director of Former Muslims United. Darwish is an outspoken critic of Islam. The Southern Poverty Law Center has described her as an anti-Arab and anti-Muslim activist.

==Biography==
Nonie Darwish was born in 1948 in Cairo, Egypt. Her father, Colonel Mustafa Hafez, was paternally of Turkish ancestry. In the 1950s her Egyptian family moved to Gaza when her father was sent by president Gamal Abdel Nasser to serve as commander of the Egyptian Army Intelligence in Gaza, which was under supervision of Egypt. Hafez founded the &quot;fedayeen&quot; who launched raids across Israel&#x27;s southern border, that between 1951 and 1956, killed many Israelis, the majority civilians. In July 1956 when Nonie was six years old, her father was killed by a mail bomb in an operation by the Israeli Defense Forces. The assassination was a response to fedayeen attacks, making Darwish&#x27;s father a &quot;shahid&quot;. The assassination was planned by Yehoshafat Harkabi. During his speech announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal, Nasser vowed that all of Egypt would take revenge for Hafez&#x27;s death. Darwish claims that Nasser asked her and her siblings, &quot;Which one of you will avenge your father&#x27;s death by killing Jews?&quot;

Darwish is an ex-Muslim and has headed a fringe group called &quot;Former Muslims United&quot;, backed by anti-Muslim activist Pamela Geller&#x27;s American Freedom Defense Initiative.

Darwish is a strong supporter of Israel, and has founded the group Arabs for Israel. She says, &quot;Just because I am pro- Israel does not mean I am anti- Arab, its just that my culture is in desperate need for reformation which must come from within&quot;.

==Views on Islam==
Darwish believes Islam is an authoritarian ideology that is attempting to impose on the world the norms of seventh-century culture of the Arabian Peninsula. She writes that Islam is a &quot;sinister force&quot; that must be resisted and contained. She remarks that it is hard to &quot;comprehend that an entire religion and its culture believes God orders the killing of unbelievers.&quot; She claims that Islam and Sharia form a retrograde ideology that adds greatly to the world&#x27;s stock of misery.

She claims the Qur&#x27;an is a text that is &quot;violent, incendiary, and disrespectful&quot; and says that brutalization of women, the persecution of homosexuals, honor killings, the beheading of apostates and the stoning of adulterers come directly out of Islamic texts.

In her book &quot;Now They Call Me Infidel&quot;, Darwish calls upon America to &quot;get tougher&quot;, impose stricter immigration laws especially on Muslim and Arab immigrants, endorse assimilation, and stop &quot;multiculturalism and cultural relativism&quot;. She has also called for non-Muslim Americans to be wary of interfaith marriages particularly those where Muslims marry Jewish or Christian women.

Darwish has participated in several conferences and rallies organized by Stop Islamization of America and Stop Islamization of Nations, and has been described as a part of the counter-jihad movement.

== Reception ==
Critics have accused Darwish of operating as part of a &quot;shariah scare industry&quot;. According to professor Deepa Kumar, Nonie Darwish has played a role in legitimizing &quot;racist attacks on Muslims and Arabs&quot;.

In a 2008 article, Max Blumenthal wrote that Darwish has described Barack Obama as a &quot;political Muslim&quot; and stated that Islam &quot;was not a true religion&quot;. At a 2011 hearing on terrorism in New York Darwish suggested that “The education of Arab children is to make killing of certain groups of people not only good, it’s holy,” and was accused by then New York State Senator Eric Adams of “bringing hate and poison&quot;. In 2012, the Southern Poverty Law Center described Darwish as being part of a group of &quot;rabid Islamophobes who promote an array of anti-Muslim conspiracy theories and propaganda&quot;. In 2017 the SPLC said Darwish had &quot;made insidious claims including saying Linda Sarsour “wants” to give up her children “to die killing Jews” and that, “she wants to bring Sharia to America.”&quot;

Professor Sahar Aziz describes Darwish as someone who converted from Islam and then allied with anti-Muslim far-right organizations. She writes that while Darwish&#x27;s views may be sincerely held, she is exploited by Islamophobic right-wing political groups.

In a 2018 journal article, Steven Fink accused Darwish of using her “ex-Muslim insider” status to give herself credibility, as well criticising her for stating that “To be a Muslim is to take an oath of submission to the Sharia state, and that oath prevents you from claiming the human rights that are the priority of any true religion. That is why Islam’s greatest enemies are Christianity and Judaism and nations that are founded on their values” and suggesting Muslims “are incapable of feeling compassion toward non-Muslims. Acknowledging compassion to non-Muslim oppressed minorities is grounds for apostasy. A Muslim must stay hardened and unyielding” with Fink writing: &quot;Worlds apart from acknowledging Muslim Americans as compatriots or fellow human beings, Darwish’s shariah scare industry portrayal transforms Muslims into anti-American automatons.&quot;

== Documentary film ==
The creator Paz Schwartz and in collaboration with the director Uriel Sinai, produced a documentary called &quot;Nuni Ayuni&quot;, which tells the story of her life in the shadow of her father who was eliminated in a targeted attack by the Israeli Mossad.

<doc id="1130236" wikidata="Q981844" url="?curid=1130236" title="Ebrahim Yazdi">
<text>Ebrahim Yazdi (; 26 September 1931 – 27 August 2017) was an Iranian politician, pharmacist, and diplomat who served as deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in the interim government of Mehdi Bazargan, until his resignation in November 1979, in protest at the Iran hostage crisis. From 1995 until 2017, he headed the Freedom Movement of Iran. Yazdi was also a trained cancer researcher.

==Early life and education==
Yazdi was born in Qazvin on 26 September 1931. He studied pharmacy at the University of Tehran. Then he received a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy again from the University of Tehran.

After the military coup of 1953, which deposed the government of Mohammad Mossadegh, Yazdi joined the underground National Resistance Movement of Iran, and was active in this organization from 1953 to 1960. This organization opposed to the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Yazdi traveled to the United States in 1961 to continue his education and in the US, continued his involvement in political activities against the Shah.

He was co-founder of the Freedom Movement of Iran, Abroad, along with Mostafa Chamran, Ali Shariati, and Sadegh Qotbzadeh in 1961. They were all part of the radical external wing of the group. In 1963, Yazdi, Chamran and Ghotbzadeh went to Egypt and met the authorities to establish an anti-Shah organization in the country, which was later called SAMA, special organization for unity and action. Chamran was chosen as its military head before returning to the US. In 1966, Yazdi moved headquarters of SAMA to Beirut. In 1967, he enrolled at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston (which before 1969 was part of the Baylor University system) and received a PhD in biochemistry.

In 1975, Yazdi was tried in absentia in an Iranian military court and condemned to ten years imprisonment, with orders issued for his arrest upon return to Iran. Because of his activities, he was unable to return to Iran and remained in the United States until July 1977. He became a naturalized US citizen in Houston in 1971. When Ayatollah Khomenei moved to Neauphle-le-Château, a Parisian suburb, from Iraq in 1978, Yazdi also went to Neauphle-le-Château and began to serve as an advisor to the Ayatollah. He was also his spokesperson in Paris.

==Career and political activities==
Yazdi worked as a research assistant of pathology and research instructor of pharmacology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston until 1977. He also worked at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Houston. From 1961 to 1977, Yazdi founded the &quot;Muslim Students Association from the United States&quot; and later became a spokesman for Paris-based Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
In 1978, he joined Ayatollah Khomeini in Paris where the latter had been in exile and became one of his advisors. He translated the reports of Khomeini into English in a press conference on 3 February 1979 in Tehran. He was the deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in the interim government of Mehdi Bazargan, until 6 November 1979. Yazdi proposed to celebrate &#x27;Jerusalem Day&#x27; and his suggestion was endorsed by Khomeini in August 1979. Yazdi&#x27;s American citizenship was revoked in 1979. In May 1980, he was appointed by Khomenei as head of the &quot;Kayhan&quot; newspaper. 

The day after the victory of the revolution, on 2 February 1979, several foreign embassies in Tehran, including those of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia were over-run by groups identifying themselves as leftist revolutionaries. The opinion of the Revolutionary Council, of which Yazdi was a member, was that these attacks may be aimed at creating chaos and preventing the international recognition of the new regime. In the case of the US embassy, the attackers were successful in entering the embassy compound and taking personnel, including the US ambassador, William Sullivan, captive. Yazdi, at the request of Ayatollah Khomeini and the Revolutionary Council, went to the embassies and resolved the crisis, resulting in the release of embassy personnel and the departure of the attackers. 
On 4 November 1979, the US embassy was taken over for a second time, this time by a group calling itself “Students Following the Line of the Imam (i.e. Ayatollah Khomeini)” and led by Mohammad Mousavi Khoeiniha, who had closer ties to certain revolutionary leaders. 

As before, Yazdi was asked to go to the embassy and resolve the crisis. He asked and received permission of Khomeini to expel the occupiers, but shortly thereafter found out Khomeini had changed his mind and appeared on state television openly endorsed the takeover of the embassy. The entire cabinet of the interim government, including Yazdi and Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, resigned in protest the next day. They stated that they opposed the embassy takeover as “contrary to the national interest of Iran”.

The embassy takeover is considered to have been motivated in part by an internal struggle between various factions within the revolutionary leadership, with Yazdi and Bazargan on one side, and more radical clergy on the other. The embassy attackers, in subsequent statements indicated that one of their primary objectives in the takeover of the US embassy in November 1979 was to force the resignation of Yazdi, Bazargan, and the entire cabinet.
Among the areas of conflict between the two factions was the behavior of the Revolutionary Courts and the Revolutionary Committees. Yazdi was present in the Revolutionary Court in the Alavi School in Tehran and acted as interrogator, prosecutor, and defense lawyer at the same time in cooperation with the judge Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhaali. In contrast to Yazdi, Bazargan supported a general amnesty for all members of the Shah&#x27;s regime, provided that they cease to act against the revolution. He publicly opposed the secret trials and the summary executions carried out by the Revolutionary Courts, led by Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhaali. Bazargan and other members of the interim government may have called for fair and open trials for those in charge of political posts under the Shah. The radical clerics, on the other hand, stated that the rapid trials and executions were essential to protect the revolution. &quot;He was the voice of the Iranian revolution and that voice was talking about freedom, democracy and women’s rights. This was something he truly believed in and he was proven to be wrong because that’s not what the revolution turned out to be. It became a killing machine after the takeover. He protested vigorously against the judicial killings of people who had been close to Shah and that got him into trouble with people around Khomeini.&quot;

After resignation from office, Yazdi and other members of the Freedom Movement of Iran ran in elections for the first post-revolutionary Islamic Consultative Assembly or parliament. Yazdi, Bazargan, and four other members of the Freedom Movement, namely Mostafa Chamran, Ahmad Sadr, Hashem Sabbaghian, and Yadollah Sahabi, were elected. They served at the parliament from 1980 to 1984.

After the Iraqi invasion of Iran in September 1980, Yazdi fully supported the Iranian war effort against the invasion, but opposed the continuation of the war after the Iranian victory in Khorramshahr in 1982. The war continued for an additional six years. During these six years, Yazdi and others in the Freedom Movement issued several open letters to Ayatollah Khomeini opposing the continuation of the war. These letters and other public statements resulted in the firebombing of Yazdi&#x27;s residence in Tehran in 1985, and the arrest and imprisonment of several members of the Freedom Movement.
In subsequent elections in Iran for president, parliament, and city councils, Yazdi and other members of the Freedom Movement filed for candidacy but were barred from running by the Guardian Council, because of their opposition to policies and actions of the government.

In December 1997, Yazdi was arrested on unknown charges and detained in Evin prison in Tehran. Even after his release, he was barred from leaving the country for many years, and summoned on a regular basis to answer questions before the revolutionary council, with his lawyer, Nobel Prize–winning Shirin Ebadi. As of 2008 Yazdi is still accused of “attempting to convert the rule of velaii (jurisprudence) into democratic rule.”

After the death of Bazargan in January 1995, Yazdi was elected as leader of Freedom Movement of Iran. Under pressure from the revolutionary court prosecutor, Yazdi offered his resignation as FMI Leader from on 20 March 2011 to the leadership council of the FMI. They have yet to accept his resignation and Yazdi continued to function as the leader of the Freedom Movement of Iran.

===Electoral history===
==Later years and death==

Yazdi was arrested in December 1997 for &quot;desecrating religious sanctities&quot; and freed on 26 December on bail. On 17 June 2009, during the 2009 Iranian election protests, it was reported that Yazdi was arrested while undergoing tests at the Tehran hospital according to the Freedom Movement of Iran website. On 22 June, he was released back to the hospital for a medical procedure. On 28 December 2009, Yazdi was arrested again in the wake of renewed protests, according to the Jaras reformist website.

Yazdi and several others were arrested on 1 October 2010 in Isfahan for participating in an &quot;illegal Friday prayer.&quot; All others were freed within days. Ebrahim Yazdi remained in &quot;temporary custody&quot;—first in Evin prison and then in a &quot;secure&quot; facility under the control of Iran&#x27;s security forces until March 2011. He was released in April 2011.
On 27 August 2017, Yazdi died of pancreatic cancer, at the age of 85 in İzmir, Turkey, where he was under treatment. His body transferred to Iran and was buried in Behesht-e Zahra.

<text>Moonseed is a 1998 science fiction novel by British author Stephen Baxter, and the final book in the NASA Trilogy. The story envisions an alternate history in which the canceled Apollo missions went ahead as planned.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Moonseed&quot; is an exploration of what could possibly happen when rock is returned from the Apollo 18 mission (which was actually cancelled in 1970). In the book, the rock contain a form of grey goo called &quot;moonseed&quot; that starts to change all inorganic matter on Earth into more moonseed. It also gets transferred by a NASA probe to Venus, and the explosion of Venus is the first clue as to what has been happening.

Stephen Baxter combines a host of disciplines (space travel, geology and disaster theory) to tell a tale where the rocks are literally swept from under the feet of humanity. During the course of the novel, in which Edinburgh is the focus for much of the action, Venus is destroyed by an unknown cosmic event that showers the Earth with radiation that somehow stirs the moonseed on Earth. When Moon-dust containing the moonseed is dropped onto the streets of Edinburgh by a lab assistant of the main character, Earth&#x27;s fate is sealed. The moonseed begins to disintegrate the planet from the inside-out as the core heats up exponentially, while on the surface, nuclear power stations catastrophically fail, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are abundant, and billions of people die as cities and continents vanish.

Over the course of the cataclysmic erosion of Earth, a collective of scientists and engineers in space agencies from around the world desperately try to terraform the Moon for colonisation, to provide a safe haven for some surviving humans before Earth eventually disintegrates into nothingness along with human civilisation.

This novel also presents numerous theories and ideas about the space-faring future of humanity, albeit in an alternate dimension where we are forced into space by an eroding Earth. It is also, in many stages, critical of NASA&#x27;s performance over the last thirty years, as well as the United Kingdom&#x27;s disaster programs.

<doc id="1130242" wikidata="Q6412196" url="?curid=1130242" title="King levitation">
<text>The King Rising levitation is a levitation illusion developed by and named after Corey King sold exclusively through Ellusionist. The King Rising was the first original magic effect to be released by the company, paving the way for many inventors to come. Some consider it to be a variation of the Balducci levitation.

==Effect==
The performer is viewed from the side. The performer&#x27;s legs may be covered (commonly with a jacket) at the beginning of the effect. At this point the performer may patter, saying something like, “You may have seen other magicians levitate behind a jacket...&quot;. This is a reference to the Superman levitation. The obstruction (jacket, etc.) would then be removed. The performer&#x27;s whole body is clearly visible. The performer suddenly appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. Both feet are clearly seen to be in the air. The levitation usually lasts just a few seconds. When both feet return to the ground, the performer&#x27;s legs may again be momentarily obscured. The performer may again make a comparative reference to the Superman levitation. Immediately afterwards the effect is complete, and the performer (particularly the performer&#x27;s clothing) and the area around the performer can be thoroughly examined.

The biggest advantage of this levitation effect is that it is (like the Balducci levitation) impromptu. It can be performed anytime, anywhere, as long as the performer is wearing pants and shoes. It is more believable than the Balducci levitation because both feet are clearly seen in the air. However, it does require a small set-up that must be done under some kind of cover (an obstruction or misdirection). It is also considerably more difficult to perform than the Balducci levitation.

==Method==

The performer stands so as to be viewed from the side. Under cover, the performer removes his or her foot from the far shoe and positions it at a right angle to that shoe, with the heel of the foot placed against the side of the shoe. After the obstruction is removed, the front of the performer&#x27;s body can be seen. From the spectator&#x27;s perspective it is impossible to tell that the performer&#x27;s foot is out, because it is hidden by the leg closest to the viewers. The performer&#x27;s weight is shifted to the leg, and the empty shoe is pinched between the angled foot and the shoe closest to the audience. The performer stands on the tip of the foot. Again, the foot remains hidden behind the shoes, which are both physically in the air, creating the impression of genuine levitation. To end the effect the process is simply reversed.

The key to this illusion is that the spectators assume that there is a foot inside of each shoe, which is a natural assumption. When both shoes are seen above the ground, it is then assumed that both feet are above the ground, and thus that the performer is levitating.

An obstruction is generally used to hide the performer&#x27;s action of removing, and replacing the foot in its shoe. It is possible however to perform the effect without ever covering the legs, by using misdirection.

<doc id="1130257" wikidata="Q7643494" url="?curid=1130257" title="Superior Art Creations">
<text>Superior Art Creations (SAC) is an underground artscene group which caters primarily to and is well known within the warez scene. SAC members have made, besides ANSI and ASCII art, VGA bitmap graphics, tracker music, and a variety of other works. SAC&#x27;s character graphics have also been used in bottles and FTP servers.

==Origin and brief history==
SAC originated as a German-based art group, founded in December 1994 by six members: Dream Design, Kaethe, Raiser, Toxic Trancer and the two artists Hetero and Roy, with Roy acting as the primary organizer of the group. The first SAC Art Pack was released the same month at &quot;The Party&quot; Demo Party in Herning, Denmark.

During the mid to late 1990s most of the notable ANSI artscene groups had distanced themselves from the warez scene, rather creating art for the sake of art, or for bulletin boards that were purely artscene related. Seizing this opportunity, SAC moved into this vacant territory and quickly became recognized as the leading group of warez scene artists. SAC was also able to establish credibility and respect from non-warez art groups and also demogroups of the broad and diverse computer art scene that was already established at the time.

==SAC organizational structure==
From the very beginning SAC had a very loose group structure. Members worked mostly independently with little if any direction from the group leaders. Every member has the freedom to decide for himself which art requests he is willing to fulfill and which not. Seniority was achieved by being an active member for an extended period of time. Exceptions were made occasionally for outstanding contributions to the Group. New member applications were accepted or rejected by a simple majority vote of the existing members. It was never the decision of a single person (regardless of the status of that member). All new member applications and artwork samples were published in designated member-only areas at the SAC World Headquarter BBS &quot;Closed Society&quot; which was located in Berlin, Germany. The applications were also made available on the Internet at SAC&#x27;s IRC Channel #SAC on the EFnet and SAC FTP Server HQ&#x27;s.

===The role of the leader===
The role of the leader was primarily the task (which wasn&#x27;t always simple) of collecting the new artwork produced by members and assembling the new SAC Art Pack, updating the group&#x27;s NFO file and releasing the Pack. This was not a problem because the leader of SAC Roy/SAC was also the SysOp of the SAC World headquarter BBS called &quot;Closed Society&quot;.

===The job of the artists, musicians and coders===
* SAC artists created and still create today ASCII &amp; ANSI Text art (.NFO release info file logos, file_id.diz logos, BBS artwork) and VGA pixel art for other computer groups, BBS&#x27;s (bulletin board systems) and FTP sites, websites and more.
* SAC musicians created &quot;MOD&quot; and later also MP3 music; just as a standalone piece of art or to be used in &quot;Intros&quot;, Demo and other programs such as &quot;Installers&quot;.
* SAC &quot;coders&quot; or programmers programmed BBS ads, Cracktros and Intros using most of the time graphics and music created by fellow SAC Members.

==SAC/PPE==
For a brief period, SAC also had a PPE (PCBoard Programming Executable) section; this was eventually separated out from SAC and became the PPE Group &quot;Peanuts&quot; (Abbreviation: PNS).

PPE&#x27;s are programs written in the proprietary PCBoard Script Language PPL (PCBoard Programming Language). They could only be used for PCBoard and no other BBS Software. PCBoard was very popular at the time and was used by over 90% of the warez BBS systems that were running on a PC. The introduction of PPL in PCBoard Version 15.0 boosted the popularity of the until then fairly unknown BBS software by Clark Development. Up to this time the PC (warez) scene did not have a powerful BBS software that could compete with the Amiga BBS software Ami-Express (Short: Ami-X or simply /X). Almost all warez BBS systems running on Amigas used /X. The PC adaptation of /X called PC Express saw a brief period of widespread use but was soon replaced by PCBoard 15.x.

All SAC PPE&#x27;s and SAC Art Packs are available for download at the SAC founder&#x27;s website. The official SAC website is currently under development.

==SAC today and tomorrow==
Towards the late 1990s, a good majority of NFO file ASCII art was created by various members of SAC. In 1999, lead ASCII artist ferrex ascended to the role of senior staff and leader, continuing to control the group to this day.

Now a globally operating organization, SAC employs approximately 40 artists and programmers worldwide and continues to be one of the groups creating art for the warez scene.

<doc id="1130259" wikidata="Q4637139" url="?curid=1130259" title="4-HO-DET">
<text>4-HO-DET, also known as 4-hydroxy-diethyl-tryptamine, CZ-74, is a hallucinogenic drug and psychedelic compound of moderate duration. 4-HO-DET is a substituted tryptamine, structurally related to psilocin, ethocybin, and 4-HO-DIPT.

==Analogs==
4-HO-DET is the N,N-diethyl analog of psilocin. The acetic acid ester of 4-HO-DET is known as 4-AcO-DET and the phosphoric acid ester of 4-HO-DET is known as 4-phosphoryloxy-DET, CEY-19, or ethocybin. These compounds may likely be prodrugs of 4-HO-DET as has been shown with the acetate and phosphate esters of other methylated tryptamines such as psilocin.

==History==
4-HO-DET received the lab code CZ-74 in the late 1950s by the inventors of the substance, Albert Hofmann and Franz Troxler. The substance was used together with its phosphoryloxy-analog ethocybin in human clinical trials in the 1960s by the German researchers Hanscarl Leuner and G. Baer. It was later explored by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book &quot;TiHKAL&quot;.

==Dosage==
&quot;TiHKAL&quot; reports moderate effects at 10–25 mg ingested orally.

==Effects==
4-HO-DET produces psychedelic effects similar to psilocybin.

==Legality==

===United States===
4-HO-DET is unscheduled in the United States, but purchase, sale, or possession for human consumption could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified 4-HO-DET as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Nov 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as 4-hydroxi-N,N-diethyltryptamin (4-HO-DET), making it illegal to sell or possess.

<text>RAW 1251AM is the student radio station at the University of Warwick and winner of the 2000 and 2003 BBC Radio 1 Student Radio Association Best Station awards.

Formerly known as W963, during the years when broadcasts were conducted via an induction loop around the university campus on 963 kHz AM, later broadcasting on 1251 kHz AM to the campus from 1999 to 2024. RAW now broadcasts from inside the Students&#x27; Union HQ building and streams all its output online.

==History==
RAW began life as University Radio Warwick in the 1970-71 academic year by students who spent their summer vacation installing an induction loop transmission system in the Rootes residence buildings. (One of these students was David Davis, who would later go on to become a Conservative MP and serve as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.) The studios consisted of a wooden hut behind Rootes M (Meriden House) and broadcast at 312 metres (963 kHz). The station was soon rebranded to URW312.

In 1977, the station was moved into the newly constructed social building (which would eventually become the Students&#x27; Union Building).

On 30 January 1999, W963 rebranded itself as RaW and on 30 September 1999, the station began broadcasting on 1251 kHz AM, discarding the then obsolete induction loop system.

RAW moved across the University of Warwick campus to University House in the Summer of 2008 as the Students&#x27; Union was refurbished. For the subsequent year RAW dropped its FM broadcast due to inability to use the FM antenna, resuming the annual broadcast for 2010.

In the Summer of 2010, RAW returned to the Students&#x27; Union, and is now based on the second floor of SUHQ (previously known as Union North).

In 2020, RAW celebrated its 50th anniversary with a pop-up radio station, Retro RAW. Retro RAW streamed for 50 hours and featured contributions from presenters past and present, as well as exclusive interviews with notable alumni such as Stephen Merchant and Timmy Mallett. In 2021, Retro RAW won the Student Radio Award for Best Event Programming.

On September 23, 2024, RAW 1251AM ceased broadcasting on 1251 kHz AM, with future plans to broadcast on Small-Scale DAB+ across Coventry.

==Activities==
RAW provided a special broadcast service for the International Children&#x27;s Games held in Coventry in July 2005, and was named the official broadcaster for this period.

In late 2005, David Davis, the Shadow Home Secretary, launched his bid for the Conservative Party leadership with a visit to RAW, the station which he helped to found. Following an interview in the studio (surrounded by around 20 journalists), Davis held a press conference in the Rootes Social Building Panorama Room, which symbolised the beginning of his campaign. His interview in the studio was later syndicated by BBC Radio 4 and the trip to the station reported on a number of media outlets.

2006 saw a large amount of work done to the station. Studio 1 saw the installation of a bespoke digital playout system (&#x27;Digiplay&#x27;) as well as redecoration, and a new office was built in the foyer of the station allowing DJs to work undisturbed.

In 2011 four members of the station embarked on a charity fundraiser named &quot;RAW on Tour&quot;. The tour consisted of a visit to 52 SRA affiliated student radio stations in England within one week. Over £1,000 was raised for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and the station was announced winner of the Charity Champion prize at the I Love Student Radio Awards later that year.

In May 2012 the station received recognition from notable industry website Media UK for an impressive set of audience figures which, in some areas of analysis, eclipsed a number of national radio stations, including BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and the Absolute Radio Network.

In 2013, RAW began its MaRaWthon Outside Broadcast that raised over £1500 for the charity Coventry Cyrenians by broadcasting for 100 hours, day and night, on the Piazza at Warwick University, as well as winning 4 Student Radio Awards for the previous years broadcasting in the categories Best Newcomer (Gold), Best Live Event (Gold), Best Speech (Silver), and Best Entertainment (Bronze).

In 2017, RAW launched a 50 Hour Broadcast in aid of Parkinson&#x27;s UK. With the help of The Cheeky Girls &amp; John Stapleton (patrons of the charity), as well as LBC&#x27;s Steve Allen and Darren Adam, and BBC&#x27;s Chris Stark they managed to raise just under £3,000 for the charity.

==Awards==
RAW has twice been named the Student Radio Association&#x27;s &quot;Station of the Year&quot;, in 2000 and 2003, along with other gold awards in both on and off air categories. At the 2020 Student Radio Awards, RAW were the first winners of a new category, The Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Award.

<text>Llangynwyd is a village (and electoral ward) 2 miles to the south of Maesteg, in the county borough of Bridgend, Wales. It was part of the medieval commote (Welsh: &quot;cwmwd&quot;) of Tir Iarll.

==History and amenities==
The village is the site of Llangynwyd parish church, the ruins of Llangynwyd Castle and one of the oldest pubs in Wales (the &quot;Old House&quot;, dating from 1147.)

The place name Llangynwyd refers to the hilltop village with a church dedicated to St Cynwyd, son of Cynfelyn. The church was founded by St Cynwyd in the 6th century. All that remains of the original structure is the stone socket of a wooden cross, which can be seen in the wall above the entrance. The church was rebuilt in the 13th century and has since been restored several times. The square tower dates from the 15th century and was completely restored in 1893. The church has the biggest private cemetery in Europe.

The old village of Llangynwyd, &quot;Top Llan&quot;, was the home of the legendary Maid of Cefn Ydfa, featured in the song &quot;Bugeilio&#x27;r Gwenith Gwyn&quot;. It was also the home of the poet Wil Hopcyn, said to have written it. The antiquary T. C. Evans was born in the parish, as was the poet Evan Bevan.

The village still celebrates the New Year, or Calennig, with the Mari Lwyd: a horse&#x27;s skull draped in a white sheet with flowers.

Today the &quot;old&quot; village of Llangynwyd is commonly referred to as &quot;Top Llan&quot; and the more recent and much larger adjoining village is simply called &quot;Llangynwyd&quot;

==Education==
The village is home to Llangynwyd Primary School, built in 1911, and to Bridgend&#x27;s first Welsh-language comprehensive school, Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Llangynwyd, which takes pupils from the county borough&#x27;s four primary schools that teach in Welsh: Ysgol Cynwyd Sant, Ysgol Bro Ogwr, Ysgol y Ferch o&#x27;r Sgêr and Ysgol Cwm Garw.

==Ward==
Llangynwyd is also the name of the electoral ward which covers the village. The ward is coterminous with the community of Llangynwyd Middle. The ward elects one county councillor to Bridgend County Borough Council.

<doc id="1130287" wikidata="Q1507288" url="?curid=1130287" title="2006 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 2006 United States Senate elections were held on November 7, 2006, with all 33 Class 1 Senate seats being contested. The term of office for those elected in 2006 ran from January 3, 2007, to January 3, 2013. Before the election cycle, the Republican Party controlled 55 of the 100 Senate seats.

The Senate elections were part of the Democratic sweep during the 2006 elections, in which Democrats made numerous gains and no congressional or gubernatorial seat held by a Democrat was won by a Republican. However, Democratic incumbent Joe Lieberman in Connecticut was defeated in the primary and was later reelected as a third-party candidate; he continued to caucus with the Democrats. Because of this, this is the first time since 1970 in which a member of a third party, who is not an independent, was elected to the Senate. Independent Jim Jeffords in Vermont retired but was succeeded by another Independent, Bernie Sanders, retaining their presence in the Senate. Jeffords and Sanders both caucused with Democrats. Democrats picked 6 seats up by defeating Republican incumbents in Missouri, Montana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Virginia, while holding open seats in Maryland and Minnesota. Republicans held their sole open seat in Tennessee.

Following the elections, no party held a majority of seats for the first time since January 1955. The Democrats were able to control the chamber because the two Independents caucused with the Democrats. They needed at least 51 seats to control the Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would have broken any 50–50 tie in favor of the Republicans. This was the only time between 1990 and 2022 that Democrats gained Senate seats in a midterm.

, this was the last time a Democrat won a Senate election in Nebraska, the last time a Democrat did not win a seat in Connecticut, and the last time that the tipping point state was decided by under 1%, with Jim Webb of Virginia winning by a margin of under .4%.

== Arizona ==

Incumbent Republican Jon Kyl won re-election to a third term over Democrat Jim Pederson, real estate developer and former chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party.






The incumbent, Republican Jon Kyl, was elected to the Senate in 1994 and was re-elected to a second term in 2000; having previously spent eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Kyl&#x27;s Democratic opponent for the general election was wealthy real-estate developer Jim Pederson, who served as the Arizona Democratic Party Chairman from 2001 to 2005. During his tenure, Pederson spent millions of dollars of his own money to help Democrats modernize and to elect Janet Napolitano as Governor of Arizona. The deadline for signing petition signatures to appear on the September 12, 2006, primary ballot was June 14, 2006.

Not long after the 2004 election, Pederson&#x27;s name began being mentioned as a potential Senate candidate for the 2006 race. On July 28, 2005, Pederson formally stepped down as Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, further fueling those speculations. In early September 2005, an e-mail was sent from the Arizona Democratic Party&#x27;s website, inviting people to an announcement by Pederson on September 7. In an anticlimactic move, an e-mail was sent out shortly after the first saying that the announcement would be postponed due to Hurricane Katrina. It was requested that any money that would be donated to Pederson&#x27;s campaign at the announcement be directed to relief efforts instead. Similarly, a meeting in Arizona of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was scheduled for around the same time. It was also postponed and the same request was made involving donations. On September 7, 2005, Pederson filed to run for the U.S. Senate. On September 14, 2005, Pederson formally announced his intention to run, in his hometown of Casa Grande, Arizona.

Although Kyl started the campaign with a sizable lead in most polls, the gap quickly narrowed, especially after Pederson released his array of ads.

Pederson lost the election by 9.84% or 150,257 votes, despite Democratic Incumbent Governor Janet Napolitano easily being re-elected and winning every county statewide. While Pederson lost it was still notable, as it was the worst performance of Senator Kyl&#x27;s career. Kyl did well as Republicans usually do in Maricopa County home of Phoenix. Pederson did well in Pima County home of Tucson which tends to support Democrats. Kyl was called the winner by CNN at around 8 P.M. local time, 11 P.M. EST. Pederson called Senator Kyl and conceded defeat at 9:02 p.m. local time, 12:02 A.M. EST.




== California ==

Incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein won re-election to her third full term.

The Republican candidate was Dick Mountjoy, who had never held a statewide elected position, but had been a state senator for several years. Also running was Libertarian Michael Metti, Don Grundmann of the American Independent Party, Todd Chretien of the Green Party and Marsha Feinland of the Peace and Freedom Party.

Because California is a state that requires a large amount of money to wage a competitive statewide campaign, it is not unusual - as was the case for this race - for a popular incumbent to have no significant opponent. Several prominent Republicans, such as Bill Jones, Matt Fong, and others, declined to run, and a previous announced challenger, businessman Bill Mundell, withdrew his declaration after determining he would not be a self-funded candidate (like Michael Huffington was in the 1994 election).







On September 22, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Mountjoy&#x27;s official biography, as found on his campaign website, falsely asserted that he had served aboard the battleship &quot;USS Missouri&quot; during the Korean War—he&#x27;d actually served aboard the heavy cruiser &quot;USS Bremerton&quot;. A review of the ships&#x27; logs corroborated this and the website was quickly changed to reflect his service aboard the &quot;Bremerton&quot; rather than the &quot;Missouri&quot;. Mountjoy denied having been responsible for adding the incorrect information

Feinstein won the election easily. Feinstein won almost every major urban area, winning in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, and San Diego. Feinstein was projected the winner as the polls closed at 11 p.m. EST.







== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Democrat Joe Lieberman lost the August 8 Democratic primary to cable executive Ned Lamont, a former Greenwich selectman. Lieberman formed his own third party and won in the general election to a fourth term.

Because Connecticut was believed to be a Democratic stronghold, Connecticut&#x27;s Senate seat was considered safe to remain as a Democratic seat by political analysts, but Lieberman&#x27;s continued support for conservative and Bush administration policies made him vulnerable to a Democratic primary challenger. Lieberman&#x27;s critics objected to what they call Lieberman&#x27;s lack of commitment to the Democratic party; his opposition to affirmative action; his opposition to a Connecticut state law that would require Catholic hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims; his membership in the bipartisan Gang of 14; his support of Florida governor Jeb Bush in the Terri Schiavo case; his initial willingness to compromise on Social Security privatization; his alliances with Republicans; and his attacks on other Democrats.

On March 13, 2006, Ned Lamont announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Lamont was more liberal than Lieberman, but he was not immune from criticism from within his own party. &quot;The New Republic&quot; senior editor and &quot;liberal hawk&quot; Jonathan Chait criticized Lamont&#x27;s supporters by comparing them to activists who he felt &quot;tore the party apart&quot; in the 1960s and 70s.

Early polling showed Lieberman with as much as a 46-point lead, but subsequent polls showed Lamont gaining until Lamont took the lead just weeks before the primary. A controversy about a &quot;kiss&quot; Lieberman supposedly received from President Bush during the 2005 State of the Union address highlighted concerns that the senator was too close to the unpopular president to be a credible Democratic nominee. Lieberman released several campaign advertisements over the summer of 2006, seeking to connect himself to former President Bill Clinton and to portray Lamont as standing for little more than opposition to Lieberman. Lamont struck back against some of Lieberman&#x27;s more negative ads with an advertisement produced by well-known political consultant Bill Hillsman. In Lamont&#x27;s ad, a foreboding narrator says, &quot;Meet Ned Lamont. He can&#x27;t make a decent cup of coffee, he&#x27;s a bad karaoke singer, and he has a messy desk.&quot; Lamont then chimes in, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you sick of political attack ads that insult your intelligence? Senator Lieberman, let&#x27;s stick to issues and pledge to support whoever wins the Democratic primary.&quot;

From midmorning August 7 to well past August 9, Lieberman&#x27;s official campaign site was taken offline; officials from Lieberman&#x27;s campaign claimed, &quot;dirty politics&quot; and &quot;Rovian tactics&quot; on the part of Lamont&#x27;s supporters, and more specifically, a sustained Distributed Denial of Service attack that, according to the Lieberman campaign, had left the site down for several days.

Tim Tagaris, Lamont&#x27;s Internet communications director, denied the charge and attributed the downtime to the fact that the Lieberman campaign had chosen an inferior web host, or ISP, and was only paying $15/month to operate its site (in comparison to the $1500/month being spent by the Lamont campaign). On December 20, 2006, a joint investigation by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal&#x27;s office and the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office cleared the Lamont campaign of the hacking accusations. A spokesman for Kevin O&#x27;Connor, the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, stated, &quot;The investigation has revealed no evidence the problems the Web site experienced were the result of criminal conduct.&quot;

Lamont won the primary with 51.79% of the vote, as opposed to Lieberman&#x27;s 48.21%. However, in his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior statements that he&#x27;d run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary.

In the Republican Party primary, Alan Schlesinger drew fire in July when it was revealed that he had been gambling under an alias in order to avoid detection as a card counter. Despite calls to withdraw from the race, Schlesinger remained in the race, ultimately becoming the Republican nominee when no other Republican challengers entered the race.


On June 12, Ned Lamont began running radio ads promising if he lost the primary to endorse Lieberman, challenging Lieberman to abandon consideration of an independent run by making a similar pledge. Lieberman refused to make this pledge; his campaign manager, Sean Smith said, &quot;Are we going to support Ned Lamont? Ah, no!&quot;

On July 3 in Hartford, Lieberman announced that he would collect signatures in order to guarantee himself a position on the November ballot. Both Lieberman and Smith said that Lieberman will run as a &quot;petitioning Democrat&quot; and would caucus with Senate Democrats if elected. On July 10, the Lieberman campaign officially filed paperwork allowing him to collect signatures to form a new political party, the Connecticut for Lieberman party.

Upon Lieberman&#x27;s announcement, independent polls continued to show him favored to win a plurality or outright majority of the vote in a three-way general election (see below). The petition issue led to charges against the Lieberman campaign of political opportunism and lack of respect for the political process. Lieberman received strong support from many prominent conservative pundits and publications. &quot;[H]is most vocal support came from places like The &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, and &quot;Commentary Magazine&quot;; Sean Hannity, Bill Kristol and right-wing radio hosts cheered for his victory.&quot; Thus, &quot;Lieberman was able to run in the general election as the &quot;de facto&quot; Republican candidate — every major Republican office-holder in the state endorsed him — and to supplement that GOP base with strong support from independents.&quot;

On August 9, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and DSCC Chair Chuck Schumer issued the following joint statement on the Connecticut Senate race:

According to &quot;The Hill&quot;, a Democratic aide to a high-ranking senator commented that Lieberman might be stripped of his Democratic privileges in the Senate. &quot;At this point Lieberman cannot expect to just keep his seniority,&quot; said the aide. &quot;He can&#x27;t run against a Democrat and expect to waltz back to the caucus with the same seniority as before. It would give the view that the Senate is a country club rather than representative of a political party and political movement.&quot;

Lieberman won with approximately 50% of the vote, and served a six-year term from January 3, 2007, to January 3, 2013. Exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33% of Democrats, 54% of independents and 70% of Republicans. Lieberman won every county in the November general election.





== Delaware ==

Incumbent Democrat Thomas R. Carper won re-election to a second term over a Republican Temple University law professor, Jan C. Ting.







== Florida ==

Incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson won re-election to a second term over Republican congresswoman Katherine Harris.



The organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which monitors political corruption, complained to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in October 2006 that the Bacardi beverage company had illegally used corporate resources in support of a fundraising event for Nelson in 2005. CREW had previously filed a similar complaint concerning a Bacardi fundraising event for Republican Senator Mel Martinez, an event that raised as much as $60,000 for Martinez&#x27;s campaign. The amended complaint alleged that, on both occasions, Bacardi violated the Federal Election Campaign Act and FEC regulations by soliciting contributions from a list of the corporation&#x27;s vendors.

Nelson was easily re-elected, winning all but 10 of Florida&#x27;s 67 counties and receiving 60.3% of the vote, winning by 1,064,421 votes or 22.2%. Nelson was projected the winner as the polls closed at 7 p.m. EST.





== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democrat Daniel Akaka won re-election to his third full term over Republican State Representative Cynthia Thielen.

Democratic congressman Ed Case ran against Akaka in the Democratic Primary, having stated that although he had the deepest respect for Akaka, Hawaii was in a time of transition with regard to the state&#x27;s representation in Congress which required that the state elect Senators of the next generation to provide continuity. He warned the state would lose all clout in Washington if the state&#x27;s two US Senators, both of whom were over 80 years old, left office within a short time of each other. If a Senator were to die, Hawaii election law requires that the governor appoint a replacement of the same party.

Hawaii&#x27;s other Representative, Neil Abercrombie, and other Senator, Daniel Inouye, pledged their support to Akaka, who won the primary with 55% of the vote.





Hawaii State Representative Cynthia Thielen was selected to be the Republican nominee after Jerry Coffee, who had previously withdrawn his candidacy, won the primary. Akaka won in all 4 Hawaii counties, taking at least 60% of the vote in each area.




== Indiana ==

Incumbent Republican Richard Lugar was unopposed by any Democratic candidate and was re-elected to his sixth six-year term with 87.3% of the vote over Libertarian radio operator Steve Osborn. This would be Lugar&#x27;s last race of his political career.

Lugar faced no opposition from the Democratic Party, as they felt Lugar was unbeatable. The Indiana Senate race was the only one in 2006 where the incumbent faced no challenger from the other major party. Also running was Libertarian Steve Osborn. Osborn was from La Porte, Indiana, and was an amateur radio operator. Exit polls projected a landslide victory for Lugar which was borne out by the result.

The election was not close, with Lugar winning every county. Osborn&#x27;s best performance was in Switzerland County, where he received just over 22% of the vote.



== Maine ==

Incumbent Republican Olympia Snowe won re-election to a third term over Democratic activist Jean Hay Bright.

Snowe, who had been elected to both of her previous terms by approximately 2-to-1 margins, had never lost an election. Snowe won by a landslide even as Democrats won across the country due to her being a centrist Republican and having a very high approval rating in Maine. Meanwhile, her Democratic opponent in the 2006 election, Jean Hay Bright, had never been elected to political office.

Democrats&#x27; best hope for taking the seat was that Snowe would retire rather than run in 2006, but there was never any indication that she seriously considered not running for re-election.

The filing deadline for major party candidates was March 15, 2006. The primary was held June 13, 2006. Olympia Snowe was unopposed for the Republican nomination; Jean Hay Bright narrowly won the Democratic nod with 50.7% of the vote against Eric Mehnert.

Hay Bright announced her candidacy in May 2005. Hay Bright was previously an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination to the House in 1994 and the Senate in 1996.

The race had been called by FOX News for Snowe 23 minutes after the polls had closed. Snowe won re-election by a greater margin than any U.S. Senator that cycle except Indiana&#x27;s Richard Lugar, who faced only a Libertarian opponent. Snowe won in all of Maine&#x27;s counties, taking at least 60% of the vote in each region.




== Maryland ==

Incumbent Democrat Paul Sarbanes, Maryland&#x27;s longest serving United States senator, decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term. Democratic nominee Ben Cardin won the open seat.

Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman and NAACP President, was the first to announce for the position, in March 2005. Ben Cardin, then a congressman since 1987, was the only other major candidate until September 2005, when Dennis F. Rasmussen, a former Baltimore County Executive, American University professor Allan Lichtman, and wealthy Potomac businessman Josh Rales entered the contest. Thirteen other candidates subsequently also entered the primary. As of August 2006, Cardin had raised more than $4.8 million and collected endorsements from a number of Democratic politicians, the AFL–CIO, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;; Mfume had raised over $1.2 million and collected endorsements from the Maryland State Teachers Association, Progressive Maryland, former Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, the National Organization for Women, and Maryland Congressmen Elijah Cummings and Al Wynn.







Michael S. Steele, Lieutenant Governor and former chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, was expected to win the Republican primary, and the Baltimore Sun wrote the month before that he faced &quot;only nominal opposition&quot;. Among a field of nine other candidates, the only Republican receiving significant media coverage was Daniel Vovak.





This was Maryland&#x27;s first open Senate seat since 1986, when Senator Barbara Mikulski was first elected.

Kevin Zeese, the nominee for the Green, Populist and Libertarian Parties, was also on the ballot.

Though Steele lost the general election by 10% of the vote, a much wider margin than predicted, his was and remains the best showing for a Republican in a Senate race in Maryland since Charles Mathias, Jr. was re-elected in 1980 with 66% of the vote.

Both Steele and Cardin made controversial statements and advertising throughout the campaign.

Cardin primarily attacked Steele over his close relations with President Bush, including pictures of Bush and Steele in Cardin&#x27;s TV ads. Steele focused on low taxes, less government spending, free markets and national security.

Despite polls days before the election showing the race at a 3% margin, Cardin won by more than 10% with a 178,295-vote margin. Steele conceded defeat at 9:02 p.m. EST.




== Massachusetts ==

Incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy won re-election to his ninth (his eighth full) term, beating Republican language school owner and activist Kenneth Chase. This was Kennedy&#x27;s last election to the Senate.

At the Massachusetts Republican Party Convention Kenneth Chase received the official endorsement with a majority of delegates, though both candidates qualified for the September primary. Former White House Chief-of-Staff Andy Card also received 3 votes.



Kennedy captured every county in the state, winning at least 62% in each region.



== Michigan ==

Incumbent Democrat Debbie Stabenow won re-election to a second term, beating Republican Michael Bouchard, Oakland County Sheriff

Economic issues took front-and-center in the campaign, as Michigan&#x27;s unemployment rate was one of the highest in the nation. In July 2006, unemployment in Michigan stood at approximately 7%, compared with a 4.7% rate nationwide. Pessimism about the state&#x27;s economic future had left Michigan ranked 49th nationally between 2000 and 2005 in retaining young adults. Since its peak, Detroit had lost over a million people. Bouchard claimed that the incumbent had accomplished nothing, dubbing her &quot;Do-Nothing Debbie.&quot; 

From a long way out, Stabenow looked like she might be vulnerable. President Bush even came to Michigan to campaign for Bouchard, raising over $1,000,000 for him. However, Bouchard never won a single poll. By October the Republican Party, started taking resources out of Michigan to focus on closer races, essentially ceding the race to Stabenow. Stabenow would go on to win the election easily, capturing nearly 57% of the vote. Stabenow did well throughout Michigan but performed better in heavily populated cities like Detroit, Lansing, Ann Arbor, and Kalamazoo. Bouchard did win Grand Rapids, a typical Republican area. He also won in many rural areas around the state. However, Bouchard failed to put a dent in Stabenow&#x27;s lead, largely due to her strong performance in heavily populated areas. Bouchard conceded to Stabenow at 9:58 p.m. EST.




== Minnesota ==

Incumbent DFL senator Mark Dayton decided in February 2005 that he would retire instead of seeking a second term. The primary elections took place on September 12, 2006. DFL nominee Amy Klobuchar won the open seat over Mark Kennedy (R), U.S. Congressman.

Klobuchar gained the early endorsement of the majority of DFL state legislators in Minnesota.









Kennedy&#x27;s routine support of President George W. Bush in House votes was a central issue for Democrats in the campaign. In June 2006, allegations were made that many references to and photos of Bush had been removed from Kennedy&#x27;s official U.S. House website; in rebuttal, Republicans said that there were 72 references to Bush on the website and that the changes noted by critics had been made some time ago, as part of the normal updating process. Ben Powers was the only ballot-qualified candidate not to be invited to appear on Minnesota Public Television&#x27;s &quot;Almanac&quot; program, despite Mr. Powers&#x27;s offer to fill the space left unfilled by Ms. Klobuchar&#x27;s decision not to appear with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Fitzgerald on the program. Green candidate Michael Cavlan appeared on the program twice during the 2006 campaign as a special guest.





== Mississippi ==

Incumbent Republican Trent Lott won re-election to a fourth term.





Lott ran for re-election without facing any opposition in his party&#x27;s primary. While it had been speculated that Lott might retire after his home was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina, he instead chose to run for re-election. Fleming is an African American, which represents 37% of the state&#x27;s population. However, no African American has ever been elected to statewide office. The last black U.S. Senator was Hiram Revels, who was appointed and took office in 1870. Fleming got little help from the DSCC, which only donated $15,000 to his campaign.




== Missouri ==

Incumbent Republican Jim Talent was elected in a special election in 2002 when he narrowly defeated incumbent Democrat Jean Carnahan. Carnahan had been appointed to the Senate seat following the posthumous election of her husband Mel Carnahan, who had died in a plane crash shortly before the 2000 election. Talent was running for a full term, his Democratic opponent was Missouri State Auditor Claire McCaskill. Early on the morning of November 8, Talent conceded defeat to McCaskill, having faced considerable political headwinds. Talent lost the election with 47% of the vote, to 50% of the vote for McCaskill.

The election was always expected to be very close, which seems fitting for a seat that has changed hands twice, both by very narrow margins, within the last six years. In 2000, the late Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator John Ashcroft 50% to 48%. Two years later in a special election held for the seat, incumbent Senator Jean Carnahan lost an even closer election to former Congressman Talent, 50% to 49%.

Missouri was seen as the nation&#x27;s bellwether state throughout the 20th century: It had voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1900, except for 1956 (when the state narrowly favored Adlai Stevenson over Dwight D. Eisenhower). Missouri&#x27;s bellwether status was due to the fact that it not only voted for the electoral victor, but that its returns usually mirrored national returns.

The state itself is a geographically central state, bordered by both the edges of Southern and Midwestern regions. In statewide contests for much of the 20th century, Missouri favored the Democratic Party. In recent elections, the Republican Party (GOP) has emerged in statewide contests. The election of 2004 was an important one; as George W. Bush was re-elected he carried Missouri. But this time his margin in the state was greater than it was nationwide. Bush won the Presidency 51% to 48%, he carried Missouri 53% to 46%. This trend had begun in 2000, when Bush lost the national popular vote to Al Gore 47% to 48% but still won Missouri, 50% to 47%. Bush&#x27;s victory also saw Republicans triumph in several statewide contests; Senator Kit Bond was re-elected by a decisive 56% to 43% margin and Matt Blunt won the election for Governor, narrowly defeating state auditor Claire McCaskill 51% to 48%. The GOP also captured control of the state legislature for the first time in eighty years.

Talent, anticipating a tough re-election battle and attempting to dissuade challengers, had accumulated a large campaign fund. For most of 2005, he had no opposition. State Senator Chuck Graham had briefly entered the race early in the year, but dropped out soon after. However, on August 30, 2005, Democrat Claire McCaskill announced her intention to run for Talent&#x27;s Senate seat.

McCaskill started with a large financial disadvantage, but she was also an experienced candidate with high name recognition. McCaskill had run two successful campaigns for state auditor. She was also a candidate for governor in 2004, when she defeated the incumbent Democratic Governor Bob Holden in the primary election but lost with 48% of the vote in the general election.

Both Talent and McCaskill faced unknowns in their respective primaries on August 8, 2006, and defeated them soundly.

The Missouri contest was seen as vitally important to control of the United States Senate; as a toss-up election between two strong candidates, the race was expected to attract a lot of interest as well as money spent on ads and turning out supporters. If Talent won, then a Democratic takeover of the U.S. Senate depended upon victories in Tennessee, where the Republican Bob Corker won, and Virginia, where Democrat Jim Webb won; the Democrats needed to win six seats to take control of the chamber with 51 seats. To do this, they would need to retain their 19 incumbent seats, win the four Republican-held seats of Montana, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania (where Democratic chances seemed above 50%, and Democrats won all 4.) and two of the following three &quot;toss-up&quot; races: Missouri, Tennessee and Virginia.

It is believed that statewide ballot issues drove the November 2006 vote. Talent was on the opposite of the majority of voters in this poll on just about every issue: 66% of Missouri voters favored raising the minimum wage to $6.50 an hour; 62% of Missouri voters favored raising taxes to replace Medicaid funding cut by the current Republican Governor, Matt Blunt; 54% opposed a law that would require all Missourians to show a photo ID before they vote; 58% favored campaign donation limitations; and 66% favored restoring Medicaid coverage to about 90,000 Missourians who lost coverage when Blunt and the Republican legislature tightened eligibility requirements.

Perhaps most importantly, 62% favored a ballot proposal that would allow all types of embryonic stem cell research allowed under federal law - a measure Talent had recently announced that he was against.

On election night the race was, as expected, too close to call. With 85% of the vote in and with still no call, McCaskill claimed victory. At the time McCaskill declared victory, she was ahead by a vote margin of 867,683 to Talent&#x27;s 842,251 votes; in percentage terms, with 85% of the vote in, McCaskill led Talent, 49% to 48%. Finally, at 11:38 p.m. Central Time the Associated Press called McCaskill as the winner. St. Louis County, adjacent to St. Louis, and Jackson County, home of Kansas City, are probably what pushed McCaskill over the finish line.





== Montana ==

Incumbent Republican Conrad Burns was running for re-election to a fourth term but was defeated by Democrat Jon Tester, President of the Montana State Senate, by a margin of 0.87%, or 3,562 votes out of 406,505 votes.

Burns was first elected as a United States senator from Montana in 1988, when he defeated Democratic incumbent John Melcher in a close race, 51% to 48%. Burns was re-elected 62.4% to 37.6%, over Jack Mudd in the Republican Revolution year of 1994. In 2000, Burns faced the well-financed Brian Schweitzer whom he beat 50.6% to 47.2%.

In 2000, George W. Bush carried Montana 58% to 33% in the race for president, but Burns won by 3.4%. Since the direct election of Senators began in 1913, Burns is only the second Republican Montana has elected to the U.S. Senate. Also, for thirty-two straight years, 1952 to 1984, Montana elected only Democratic Senators.

Burns&#x27;s involvement in the Jack Abramoff scandal made him vulnerable. A SurveyUSA poll released in March 2006 found that 38% of Montanans approved of him, while 52% disapproved of him. Polls against leading Democratic candidates had him below his challengers.

On May 31, 2006, Richards, citing the closeness of the race, and his own position (third) in the polls, withdrew from the race, and threw his support to Tester. Morrison started off strong in the race for the Democratic nomination for Senator, collecting $1.05 million as of the start of 2006, including $409,241 in the last three months of 2005. but Morrison&#x27;s advantages in fundraising and name identification did not translate into a lead in the polls. Later, the race was called a &quot;deadlock,&quot; but Tester continued to gather momentum.






The race was expected to be close, due to Burns&#x27;s previous narrow winning margins and recent political scandal involving him personally; Republican incumbents everywhere were facing more challenging races in 2006 due to the waning popularity of Congress and the leadership of President George W. Bush. In July 2006, the Rasmussen report viewed Burns as the &quot;second most vulnerable Senator seeking re-election this year (Pennsylvania&#x27;s Rick Santorum was still the most vulnerable).&quot;

Senator Conrad Burns of Montana faced a strong challenge from Brian Schweitzer in 2000, being re-elected by 3.4% in a state that went for Bush twice by margins of over 20%. This, combined with the increasing strength of the state Democratic party and accusations of ethical issues related to the Jack Abramoff scandal, made this a highly competitive race.

On July 27, Burns was forced to apologize after he confronted out of state firefighters who were preparing to leave Montana after helping contain a summer forest fire and directly questioned their competence and skill; Burns was strongly criticized.

On August 31, in a letter faxed to the office of Montana governor Brian Schweitzer, Burns urged the governor, a Democrat, to declare a fire state of emergency and activate the Montana Army National Guard for firefighting. Schweitzer had already declared such a state of emergency on July 11 — thus, activating the Montana Army National Guard. He issued a second declaration on August 11. A Burns spokesman said the senator was &quot;pretty sure&quot; Schweitzer had already issued such a disaster declaration, but just wanted to make sure. &quot;The genesis of the letter was just to make sure that all the bases were covered,&quot; Pendleton said. &quot;This is not a political football. It&#x27;s just a cover-the-bases letter and certainly casts no aspersions on the governor.&quot;



Due to errors with polling machines the Montana count was delayed well into Wednesday November 8. The race was too close to call throughout the night and many pundits predicted the need for a recount. After a very close election, on November 9, incumbent Conrad Burns conceded defeat.

Just before 11:00 am (MST) on November 8, Jon Tester was declared Senator-elect for Montana in &quot;USA Today&quot;. At 2:27 pm EST on November 8, CNN projected that Jon Tester would win the race.

Burns conceded the race on November 9, and congratulated Tester on his victory.

The race was the closest Senate election of 2006 in terms of absolute vote difference; the closest race by percentage difference was the Virginia senate election.

== Nebraska ==

Incumbent Democrat Ben Nelson won re-election to a second term. As of 2021, this is the last Senate election in Nebraska won by a Democrat.


Republican Pete Ricketts, former COO of TD Ameritrade and future Governor of Nebraska financed his own campaign. His opponents could not raise enough money to keep up. Kramer raised $330,000 and Stenberg raised $246,000 in 2005.


The primary election was held May 9, 2006. Pete Ricketts won the Republican nomination with 48% of the vote. Ben Nelson was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. Nelson was elected in 2000 by a margin of 51% to 49% after serving as the state&#x27;s governor for two terms. Nelson, considered the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, was the lone Democrat in Nebraska&#x27;s Congressional delegation. This election was one of the most expensive in Nebraska history. In 2005, Ben Nelson raised $3.9 million for his re-election campaign. Pete Ricketts contributed $14.35 million of his own money to his campaign; he raised an additional $485,000 in contributions. The race also attracted national attention and generated several high-level campaign appearances. President George W. Bush appeared at a rally for Ricketts on November 5, 2006, in Grand Island, while then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama appeared at a fundraiser for Nelson and other Nebraska Democrats on May 5, 2006, in Omaha. However, he won re-election by a wide margin.



== Nevada ==

Incumbent Republican John Ensign won re-election to a second term over Democrat Jack Carter, Navy veteran and son of President Jimmy Carter.





Popular Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman had said in January that he would probably run, but in late April, he decisively ruled that out. Goodman did not file by the May 12, 2006, deadline. Carter&#x27;s advantages included his formidable speaking abilities and kinship with a former U.S. president. On the other hand, Ensign was also considered to be an effective speaker and as of the first quarter of 2006, held an approximately 5–1 advantage over Carter in cash-on-hand.




Ensign won a majority of the votes in every county in the state, with his lowest percentage at 53%.

== New Jersey ==

Incumbent Democrat Bob Menendez was elected for a full term. The seat was previously held by Democratic Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine. After Corzine resigned and was sworn in Governor, Corzine appointed Congressman Menendez on January 18, 2006. Menendez was challenged by Republican Thomas Kean, Jr. and seven other candidates. Filing for the primary closed on April 10, 2006. The primary election was held June 6, 2006. Menendez became the first Hispanic to hold a U.S. Senate seat from New Jersey, and was the first Latino elected to statewide office in the state.

Menendez won the Democratic primary, with 86% of the vote, against James D. Kelly, Jr.

Republican John P. Ginty, associate director with Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s represented the conservative wing of the New Jersey Republican party. Kean was a moderate, and the son of the former Governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean. Kean won the primary by a 3–1 margin.

The biggest factors in the New Jersey Senate race may have had little to do with the candidates involved and more to do with Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine and President George W. Bush.

In mid-summer, Jon Corzine and the Democratic-controlled state legislature held a brief shutdown of state government, which ultimately resulted in a sales tax increase, among other things.

In a September 2006 poll, SurveyUSA found that Corzine received an approval rate of only 43%, with 48% of the state disapproving. Since Menendez had been appointed by Corzine, some pundits argued that this would be a resonating factor with a number of voters.

According to a separate September 2006 poll, SurveyUSA found that the state of New Jersey had a rather high disapproval rating for Republican President George W. Bush, with 64% disapproving and only 32% approving. This led some to argue that voters would take their discontent with Bush out on Kean in the November election.

Indeed, some pollsters demonstrated that concerns over the Iraq War and discontent with President Bush solidified the Democratic base in October&#x27;s advertising blitz, and won over enough independents to seal of fate of the Republican nominee. On the eve of the election, Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s PublicMind Poll reported that 65% likely voters said that the US invasion of Iraq was a mistake, &quot;including nine of ten Democrats and six of ten independents.&quot; Observers also pointed out that &quot;from the beginning, [Menendez] made much of his 2002 vote against the Iraq War Resolution, often referring to it as one of the most important votes of his career. He made it clear as well that he intended to make the race a referendum on the President.&quot;

Others attributed Kean&#x27;s early strong showing in the polls of this blue state to uninformed voters confusing the three-year state senator with his father, the popular former governor and 9/11 Commission chairman.

Because of Kean&#x27;s perceived liberalism on social issues, he has been labeled by some conservatives as a &quot;Republican in Name Only&quot;.

On June 13, 2006, Kean held a fundraiser in Ocean County featuring First Lady Laura Bush. It was here that both Senator Kean and Mrs. Bush pointed out that Kean is not George W. Bush, claiming that Senator Menendez seems to confuse the two.

On June 16, 2006, at a New Jersey Association of Counties speaking event in Atlantic City, Kean and his aides beat a hasty retreat from the ballroom engagement and &quot;stampeded&quot; into an elevator in an abortive attempt to avoid the press, only to exit on the same floor as they had entered. Kean declined to answer questions about the scathing attacks on his integrity which his opponent had delivered minutes earlier, instead opting to repeat &quot;a few slogans.&quot;

In late June, the Associated Press reported that Kean&#x27;s campaign was planning a &quot;Swift Boat&quot;-style film accusing Menendez of involvement in a New Jersey mob-connected kickback scheme &quot;despite public records and statements disputing that claim.&quot; The AP article noted that &quot;[f]our former federal prosecutors who oversaw the case have said Menendez was never involved in any wrongdoing.&quot; The airing of unsubstantiated allegations years or even decades old is a hallmark of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign attack style, which gained notoriety during the 2004 U.S. presidential election.

In mid-September, &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; reported that Sen. Menendez had declined a national debate with Kean on the popular Sunday morning talk-show, Meet the Press. A Menendez spokesperson stated that the incumbent Democrat would prefer to focus on local citizens and press. Menendez did agree to take place in three locally aired debates with Kean, which will be aired between October 7–17. Kean withdrew from one of the scheduled debates to which he had previously committed, an October 14, 2006, debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters, insisting on a national TV debate as a condition of his participation.

Both candidates agreed to participate in a virtual debate sponsored by the nonpartisan Hall Institute of Public Policy - New Jersey which provided &quot;an unprecedented opportunity for candidates and citizens to engage in an interactive forum on the important issues confronting&quot; New Jersey. Beginning in July and running through Election Day in November, the institute submitted questions to the candidates and then posted their responses on its website.






== New Mexico ==

Incumbent Democrat Jeff Bingaman won re-election to a fifth term.


David Pfeffer, Santa Fe City Councilman announced on August 23, 2005, that he would be entering the primary. A former Democrat, he supported George W. Bush in 2004 and became a Republican in 2005. In his campaign announcement, Pfeffer focused mainly on border controls with Mexico. He criticised Bingaman in comparison to his own support for reform of the Social Security system and the Iraq War as well as U.S. relations with China, saying &quot;With all due respect, I do not believe the present occupier of the junior seat from New Mexico is doing all that can and should be done on these fronts,&quot; he said of Bingaman. &quot;I believe I can do a better job ... &quot; Pfeffer also commented that he would have a hard time raising an amount equivalent to Senator Bingaman, a problem faced by any of the latter&#x27;s potential challengers.


Bingaman had a 60% approval rating in one poll. He faced no primary opposition. There had been speculation that Bingaman would give up the chance to run for another term to become a lobbyist.




Bingaman won every county in the state with at least 56% of the vote.

== New York ==

Incumbent Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton won by a more than two-to-one margin. Clinton was challenged by Republican John Spencer, a former Mayor of Yonkers, New York.




Clinton spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections.

On November 7, 2006, Clinton won easily, garnering 67% of the vote to Spencer&#x27;s 31%. The election was not close, with Clinton winning 58 of New York&#x27;s 62 counties. Clinton had a surprisingly strong performance in upstate New York which tends to be a tossup. When Clinton&#x27;s upstate margins combined with her huge numbers out of New York City, there was no coming back for the Republicans. Clinton was sworn in for what would be her last term in the Senate, serving from January 3, 2007, to January 21, 2009, when she assumed the office of United States Secretary of State.

== North Dakota ==

Incumbent Dem-NPL-er Kent Conrad won re-election to a fourth term, beating Republican farmer Dwight Grotberg.

Popular Republican governor John Hoeven was heavily recruited by prominent national Republicans, including Karl Rove and Dick Cheney to run against Conrad. SurveyUSA polls showed that both Conrad and Hoeven had among the highest approval ratings of any Senators and governors in the nation. A poll conducted by PMR (8/26-9/3 MoE 3.9) for &quot;The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead&quot; had as result for a hypothetical matchup: Hoeven-35%, Conrad-27%, Uncommitted-38%. This poll showed voter conflict between two very popular politicians in a small state where party loyalty is often trumped by personality. In late September 2005, Hoeven formally declined. Hoeven ran for the Senate in 2010 and was elected.



Conrad won at least 53% of the vote in every county in the state.

== Ohio ==

Incumbent Republican Mike DeWine ran for re-election but lost to Democratic congressman Sherrod Brown.

DeWine had approval ratings at 38%, making him the second most unpopular U.S. Senator, behind Pennsylvania Republican Rick Santorum, who was also up for re-election in 2006. Pre-election stories in the U.S. media suggested that the national Republican Party may have given up on saving Senator DeWine&#x27;s senate seat before election date. Sherrod Brown, former Ohio Secretary of State and U.S. Representative from Ohio&#x27;s 13th district was the Democratic candidate, and the eventual winner.

Paul Hackett, Iraq War veteran announced on February 13, 2006, that he would withdraw from the race, because national party leaders had decided that Sherrod Brown had a better chance against DeWine. &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; (2/18/06) also reported that there had been concerns that Hackett might not have had enough money after the primary to run the statewide advertising customary for a Senate campaign.



Both Republican challengers, engineer William G. Pierce and David Smith, candidate for OH-02 in 2005, campaigned as conservative alternatives to DeWine, citing DeWine&#x27;s support for legal abortion and his role as one of the Republican members of the Gang of 14 who compromised with Democrats in a dispute about judicial appointments. DeWine won the primary 71.82% of the votes.

Because this race was targeted by Democrats, it made it all the more important to the GOP, who desired to retain Senate control. John McClelland, a spokesman for the Ohio Republican Party said, &quot;It&#x27;s vitally important to the Republican Party as a whole, so I think that&#x27;s why you see the president coming to Ohio to support Mike DeWine. Phil Singer, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said, &quot;Mike DeWine Senior is in for the fight of his life, make no mistake about it&quot;.

On July 14, 2006, DeWine&#x27;s campaign began airing TV commercials depicting a smoking World Trade Center. &quot;The senator was notified ... by a reporter at &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; that the image of the burning Twin Towers could not have depicted the actual event because the smoke was blowing the wrong way.&quot; DeWine&#x27;s campaign admitted that the video was actually a still photo of the World Trade Center with smoke digitally added. He also was criticized for using an emotionally charged image to attack his challenger.

Another of DeWine&#x27;s ads suggested that opponent Sherrod Brown did not pay his taxes for thirteen years. This claim led to the Associated Press reporting on October 19 that, &quot;Several Ohio television stations have stopped airing a Republican ad because state documents contradict the ad&#x27;s accusation that Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Sherrod Brown didn&#x27;t pay an unemployment tax bill for 13 years.&quot; Brown produced a commercial citing these facts. DeWine&#x27;s ads were changed to state only that he had failed to pay his unemployment taxes until legal action was taken against him.

According to an article in the October 16, 2006, edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, top Republican party officials on the national level determined that DeWine would probably be defeated and were moving financial support from his race to other Republican senatorial candidates they felt were more likely to win.

Brown was called the winner right when the polls closed at 7:30. DeWine had the second worst performance of a Republican incumbent in 2006. Only Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania had a worse performance. While DeWine was able to win rural counties in western Ohio, Brown managed to win most eastern Ohio counties, especially in heavily populated areas. DeWine&#x27;s narrow 2,000 vote victory in Hamilton County which is home to Cincinnati, came nowhere close to making a dent in Brown&#x27;s lead. Brown would go on to be re-elected in 2012 and again in 2018.



== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican Rick Santorum ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by Bob Casey, Jr. Casey was elected to serve between January 3, 2007, and January 3, 2013. Santorum trailed Casey in every public poll taken during the campaign. Casey&#x27;s margin of victory (nearly 18% of those who voted) was the largest ever for a Democratic Senate nominee in Pennsylvania, and the largest margin of victory for a Senate challenger in the 2006 elections.

Bob Casey, Jr., State Treasurer, former State Auditor General and son of former Governor Bob Casey, Sr. won the Democratic primary.




Santorum was unopposed in the Republican primary. Republican John Featherman (not to be confused with John Fetterman), who ran against Santorum in 2000 as a Libertarian, had been expected to challenge him in the 2006 Republican primary. However, Featherman withdrew his candidacy after a GOP petition challenge because he did not have the necessary number of signatures to get on the ballot.

Republican strategists took as a bad omen Santorum&#x27;s primary result in 2006, in which he ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Republican gubernatorial nominee Lynn Swann, also unopposed in the primary, garnered 22,000 more votes statewide than Santorum in the primary, meaning thousands of Republican voters abstained from endorsing Santorum for another Senate term. This may have been partly due to Santorum&#x27;s support for Arlen Specter, over Congressman Pat Toomey in the 2004 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. Even though Santorum was perceived to be only slightly less conservative than Toomey, he joined virtually all of the state and national Republican establishment in supporting the moderate Specter. This led many socially and fiscally conservative Republicans to consider Santorum&#x27;s support of Specter to be a betrayal of their cause. However, Santorum said that he supported Specter to avoid risking a Toomey loss in the general election, which would have prevented President George W. Bush&#x27;s judicial nominees from getting through the Senate. Santorum said Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito would not have been confirmed without the help of Specter, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time.




At 9:45 pm EST on Election Night, Santorum called Casey to concede defeat.

== Rhode Island ==

The election was won by Sheldon Whitehouse, former Attorney General of Rhode Island and former U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island. Republican Lincoln Chafee was seeking re-election for a second full term to the seat he had held since 1999, when he was appointed to fill the vacancy created by the death of his father John Chafee. Lincoln Chafee won election to the seat in 2000.

Whitehouse was endorsed by U.S. Senator Jack Reed, U.S. Congressmen Jim Langevin and Patrick J. Kennedy, as well as by former candidate Matt Brown. Carl Sheeler, a former U.S. Marine, a business owner, and an adjunct professor of business, ran on a more progressive platform. Ultimately, however, Whitehouse would trounce his competition in the primary on September 12, winning his party&#x27;s support by a large margin.


Incumbent Lincoln Chafee was one of the most liberal members of the Republican Party in the Senate by 2006, and was challenged for the Republican nomination by Steve Laffey, Mayor of Cranston, who had criticized Chafee for his liberal voting record in the Senate. In early 2006, the Club for Growth, a pro-tax cut political action committee, sent a series of mailings to Rhode Island Republicans attacking Chafee&#x27;s positions and voting record.

The national GOP supported Chafee in the primary campaign, believing that he was the most likely candidate to hold the seat in the general election. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, John McCain of Arizona and Laura Bush appeared at fundraisers for Chafee, while Senator Bill Frist&#x27;s PAC donated to Chafee. The National Republican Senatorial Committee also ran ads in the state supporting Chafee. Steve Laffey, however, picked up many endorsements from Republican town committees throughout Rhode Island, the national group Club for Growth, and former candidate for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination Steve Forbes. On July 10, 2006, the National Republican Senatorial Committee filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Laffey, saying that he had included a political communication in tax bills mailed to residents of Cranston.



Democrats believed that this was one of the most likely Senate seats to switch party control, due to the Democratic tilt of Rhode Island, as well as the fact that Chafee needed to expend part of his campaign fund to win the Republican primary election. Chafee&#x27;s approval ratings also took a beating from his primary battle with Laffey and may have hurt him in the general election. Another factor that hurt Chafee was the fact that Whitehouse, the Democratic nominee, had a huge head start on him, as he was able to campaign with little opposition for at least half the year and had not had to contend with a major opponent until the general election campaign. Rhode Islanders&#x27; historically large disapproval ratings for President Bush and the Republican Party as a whole was another major hurdle for Chafee.

Whitehouse and Chafee very rarely disagreed on political issues. Socially, they agreed almost 100% of the time. Chafee was against the Bush tax cuts, indicating his ideology was liberal-leaning. On some fiscal issues they disagreed on such as on social security and free trade.



Whitehouse carried Providence County, which contains approximately 60% of the state&#x27;s population, with 59% to Chafee&#x27;s 41%. Chafee&#x27;s strongest showing was in Washington County (&quot;South County&quot;), where he took 55% of the vote against Whitehouse&#x27;s 45%. Chafee also took Kent County by a small margin, while Whitehouse was victorious by extremely slim margins in Bristol and Newport counties.

After the election, when asked by a reporter if he thought his defeat would help the country by giving Democrats control of Congress, he replied, &quot;to be honest, yes.&quot;

== Tennessee ==

Winner Bob Corker replaced Republican Bill Frist who retired upon the end of his second term in 2007. Corker was the Republican nominee, and the Democratic nominee was Harold Ford, Jr., U.S. Representative. The race between Ford and Corker was one of the most competitive Senate races of 2006, with Corker winning the race by less than three percent of the vote. Corker was the only non-incumbent Republican to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2006. Since 1994, the Republican Party has held both of Tennessee&#x27;s Senate seats.

Ford is known nationally for his keynote address at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California, and for a challenge to Nancy Pelosi for leadership of the House Democrats. Rosalind Kurita, a six-term state Senator from Clarksville, Tennessee, dropped out of the race in early April 2006. No official reason was given, but Ford enjoyed substantial support from Democratic leaders in Washington and Nashville and held a substantial lead in fundraising. Ford won the Democratic nomination by a wide margin in the primary.

Only 11 percent of Tennesseans knew who Corker was when he began running for the Senate race. All three Republicans had run statewide campaigns in the past, albeit unsuccessful ones: former U.S. Representative Ed Bryant for the 2002 Republican Senate nomination, losing to Lamar Alexander; businessman and former Mayor of Chattanooga Bob Corker for the U.S. Senate in 1994, losing to Frist in the Republican primary; and former U.S. Representative Van Hilleary for Tennessee Governor in 2002, losing to Democrat Phil Bredesen. Corker won the nomination by obtaining 48% of the primary vote to Bryant&#x27;s 34% and Hilleary&#x27;s 17%.

Not long after Corker&#x27;s primary victory was assured, Ford, at a rally of his supporters attended by Bill Clinton, challenged Corker to seven televised debates across the state. In response, Corker said he will debate Ford but did not agree to Ford&#x27;s request of seven debates. Both of Corker&#x27;s primary opponents endorsed Corker immediately after they conceded the race.

Before a Corker press conference in Memphis on October 20, Ford approached Corker in a parking lot and confronted his opponent about Iraq in front of local news cameras, pointing out that some of Corker&#x27;s fellow Republicans are changing their minds on the war and wanting to debate him about the issue. In response, Corker said, &quot;I came to talk about ethics, and I have a press conference. And I think it&#x27;s a true sign of desperation that you would pull your bus up when I&#x27;m having a press conference.&quot; Ford replied that he could never find Corker. Corker then walked away to his press conference.

On November 2, Nielsen Monitor Plus indicated that the Corker campaign had purchased more television advertising than any other Senate candidate in the country through October 15.

A particularly negative ad titled &quot;Who Hasn&#x27;t?&quot; sponsored by the Republican National Committee (&quot;RNC&quot;) that aired during the third and fourth weeks of October gained national attention and condemnation from both Ford and Corker. The ad portrayed a scantily clad white woman (Johanna Goldsmith) acting as a Playboy bunny who &quot;met Harold at the &quot;Playboy&quot; party&quot; and invites Ford to &quot;call me&quot;.

Responding to questions about the ad, a Ford spokesperson said that Ford went to a 2005 Playboy-sponsored Super Bowl party that was attended by more than 3,000 people, and Ford himself said that he likes &quot;football and girls&quot; and makes no apology for either.









== Texas ==

Incumbent Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison won re-election to a third term over Democratic attorney Barbara Ann Radnofsky.

The Democratic nominee who had never run for public office was expected to face a robust challenge in the general election, especially in a state that has not elected a Democrat statewide since 1994 and against a historically popular Hutchison. Since neither Radnofsky nor her main opponent, Gene Kelly, had received a majority of votes in the Democratic primary, a runoff was held April 11, 2006, which Radnofsky won. Radnofsky&#x27;s campaign platform is available on her website. Scott Lanier Jameson won the Libertarian Party nomination at the party&#x27;s state convention on June 10, 2006, defeating Timothy Wade and Ray Salinas. Arthur W. Loux, a Roman Forest City Councilman and a member of the Minutemen, was running as an independent.

Hutchison co-sponsored legislation supporting the creation of a constitutional amendment that would limit terms for senators but had been quoted saying that she would only leave after two terms if such a law applied to all senators. After deciding not to challenge Governor Rick Perry this year, as had been widely speculated, Hutchison was running for a third term. She had no opposition in the Republican primary and had approval ratings in the 60 percent range going into the General Election , although they had been slipping rapidly.




== Utah ==

Incumbent Republican Orrin Hatch won re-election to a sixth term over Democrat Pete Ashdown, the founder and CEO of Utah&#x27;s oldest Internet service provider, XMission.




Hatch won all but one county with 60% to 70% of the vote. Ashdown won the remaining one county by 342 votes.

== Vermont ==

Incumbent Independent Jim Jeffords decided to retire rather than seek re-election to a fourth term in office and Bernie Sanders was elected to succeed him over Republican businessman Richard Tarrant.

Sanders represented Vermont&#x27;s at-large House district as an independent, won the Democratic primary and then dropped out to run as an independent. Many Democratic politicians across the country endorsed Sanders, and no Democrat was on the ballot. The state committee of the Vermont Democratic Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders. Sanders won the open seat with 65% of the vote.

Four candidates ran in the Democratic primary. Sanders won the primary, but declined the nomination, leaving no Democratic nominee on the ballot. This victory ensured that no Democrat would appear on the general election ballot to split the vote with Sanders, an ally of the Democrats, who has been supported by leaders in the Democratic Party.

In mid-August 2006, the campaign heated up considerably, with Tarrant fully engaged in heavy media advertising, most of which criticized Sanders&#x27;s public stances. Tarrant ran several ads accusing Sanders of representing himself differently from his voting record in the House of Representatives, citing such examples as Sanders&#x27;s votes against Amber Alert and against increased penalties for child pornography. Sanders responded with an ad stating that Tarrant&#x27;s claims are &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;distort my record&quot; and presented what he viewed as more accurate explanations of his voting record.




Sanders won a majority of the votes in every county in the state, with 57% as his lowest county total.

== Virginia ==

Incumbent Republican George Allen ran for re-election to a second term, but lost in a narrow race to Democrat Jim Webb.

Allen, who previously served as Governor of Virginia and was considered a possible candidate for president in 2008, was running for his second term. Webb, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, writer and former Secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan won the Democratic nomination after being drafted by netroots activists, such as those at the blog Raising Kaine. Polls clearly favored Allen through mid-August, when he was caught on videotape on August 11 twice using an ethnic slur in reference to a Webb campaign volunteer, S.R. Sidarth, who is of Indian ancestry. Allen denied any prejudice in the comment, but his lead shrank considerably. Still, he led in most polls until late October, when several surveys showed Webb with a lead — mostly within the margin of error. The election was not decided until nearly 48 hours after the polls closed, when Allen, behind by a margin of about 0.3%, conceded on November 9, 2006. With all of the other Senate races decided, the outcome swung control of the Senate to the Democrats.

The week before the primary, businessman Harris Miller said a Webb campaign flier characterized him in an anti-Semitic way; Webb denied that it did.



Webb focused on his early and outspoken opposition to the war in Iraq, which Allen supported. In a September 4, 2002, opinion piece in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Webb wrote: &quot;A long-term occupation of Iraq would beyond doubt require an adjustment of force levels elsewhere, and could eventually diminish American influence in other parts of the world.&quot; Webb&#x27;s son, a U.S. Marine, served in Iraq.

Allen and Webb differed on other issues. Allen is anti-abortion; Webb supports abortion rights. Allen supported George W. Bush&#x27;s tax cuts while Webb said more of the benefits should have gone to middle-class Americans. Both candidates supported the death penalty, right-to-work laws, and Second Amendment rights.



Virginia has historically been one of the more Republican Southern states: for instance it was the only Southern state not to vote for Jimmy Carter in 1976, its congressional delegation was mostly conservative, with eight of eleven Congressmen and both Senators belonging to the Republican Party prior to the 2006 election. This made Virginia&#x27;s Congressional delegation the most Republican of any Southern state. Despite this, Democrats had won the previous two gubernatorial races, in 2001 and 2005. The state&#x27;s political majority has been changing from conservative white to a mixture of races, especially Hispanic. The state is increasingly diverse; it had the highest percentage of Asians (4.7%, according to the 2005 American Community Survey of the U.S. census) of any Southern state. 9.9% of Virginians are foreign-born.
Webb, like Governor Tim Kaine in 2005, won the four major fast-growing counties in Northern Virginia outside Washington, D.C.; Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William and Arlington. President Barack Obama carried Virginia by a 6.3% margin over Republican Senator John McCain.

When results began coming in, Allen quickly built a sizeable lead, which began to narrow as the night went on. With 90% of precincts reporting, Allen held a lead of about 30,000 votes , or about 1.5%. However, as votes began to come in from population-heavy Richmond, Webb narrowed the gap, and pulled ahead within the last 1 or 2% of precincts to report. Preliminary results showed Webb holding a lead of 8,942 votes, and many news organizations hesitated to call the election for either candidate until the next day. At 8:41 pm EST on November 8, AP declared Webb the winner.
In all Virginia elections, if the margin of defeat is less than half of a percentage point, the Commonwealth of Virginia allows the apparent losing candidate to request a recount, paid for by the local jurisdictions. If the margin of defeat is between one and one-half of a percentage point, the losing candidate is still entitled to request a recount, but must cover its expense.
Because the difference was less than 0.5%, George Allen could have requested a recount paid for by the government, but declined to make such a request. That was likely because:
* Even in large jurisdictions, recounts — such as those in Florida in 2000 and Washington&#x27;s 2004 gubernatorial election — rarely result in a swing of more than 1,000 votes, and Allen was trailing by almost 10,000 in the initial count. In particular, almost all votes in this Virginia election were cast using electronic voting machines, whose results are unlikely to change in a recount.
* There was wide speculation that calling for a recount (and still losing) would give Allen a &quot;sore loser&quot; label, which would hurt his future election campaigns, including what some speculated might still involve a 2008 presidential run. However, after losing the senatorial election, on December 10, 2006, Allen announced that he would not be running for president in 2008.

== Washington ==

Incumbent Democrat Maria Cantwell won re-election to a second term.

The filing deadline was July 28, 2006, with the primary held September 19, 2006. Cantwell consistently led in polling throughout the race, although political analysts saw her as vulnerable this election cycle due to her extremely narrow win in 2000 and discontent among progressive voters. In November, The National Journal ranked Cantwell&#x27;s seat as number 13 of the top 20 races to watch based on the likelihood of switching party control, and the third-highest Democratic seat likely to flip. However, in an election marked by discontent over the Republican leadership in D.C., Cantwell easily won by a 17% margin of victory.

Statewide politics in Washington had been dominated by the Democratic Party for many years. The governor, lieutenant governor, treasurer, state auditor, and insurance commissioner were all Democrats, while only secretary of state, attorney general, and commissioner of public lands were Republican. Of the nine representatives Washington sent to the House of Representatives, six were Democrats. Democrat Patty Murray was the state&#x27;s senior senator. Cantwell won her initial election to the Senate in 2000 over Slade Gorton by 2,229 votes. Due to the closeness of that race, and the close gubernatorial contest between Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi in November 2004, many Republicans believed they had a strong chance of capturing Cantwell&#x27;s seat in 2006.

On March 9, 2006, Aaron Dixon announced his decision to seek the Green Party&#x27;s nomination for U.S. Senate, challenging Cantwell on her continued support for the U.S. presence in Iraq and the USA PATRIOT Act. On May 13, 2006, Mr. Dixon secured the party&#x27;s nomination at the Green Party of Washington state&#x27;s Spring Convention.

Initially, Cantwell had two challengers from within the Democratic primary, both of them taking strong stances against the Iraq war that brought attention to Cantwell&#x27;s votes for the Iraq Resolution and against a timeline for withdrawal. Three other Democrats also entered the primary race.

On August 8, 2006, the incumbent Democratic Senator from Connecticut, Joe Lieberman, lost his primary race to challenger Ned Lamont by 52%-48%, and then ran as an Independent in the general election. A great deal of attention was focused on this race as an early barometer of both anti-incumbent and anti-war sentiment nationwide. Comparisons were made between Lieberman&#x27;s troubles and Cantwell&#x27;s re-election bid, citing Cantwell&#x27;s vote in favor of the Iraq Resolution that led to the war, her refusal to say she regretted the vote, and her vote against a timetable for withdrawal.

Unlike Lamont&#x27;s campaign, Cantwell&#x27;s anti-war opponents&#x27; campaigns received much less funding and did not have the same support from the blogosphere that brought Lamont to prominence and improved his name recognition. Also, unlike Lieberman, Cantwell altered her position on the war during her campaign and criticized the Bush Administration for its conduct of the war. She also hired her most vocal anti-war primary opponent, Mark Wilson, at $8,000-a-month salary, a move that was described by political commentators as &quot;buying out&quot; the opposition (which she also allegedly attempted with other anti-war challengers Hong Tran and Aaron Dixon). The article noted that, despite the differences in exact circumstances, the Lieberman defeat also showed that voters were in an anti-incumbent mood, which could&#x27;ve created problems for Cantwell. This was supported by another P-I article that also noted that the primary loss of Lieberman and two House incumbents, Michigan Republican Joe Schwarz and Georgia Democrat Cynthia McKinney, on the same day indicated that there may have been a nationwide anti-incumbent trend.

Following the primary results, Cantwell endorsed Ned Lamont and McGavick responded by endorsing Senator Lieberman. The Dixon campaign released a statement criticizing Cantwell&#x27;s &quot;spin and vague rhetoric&quot; on the war, and equating her current position to a pro-war stance similar to Lieberman&#x27;s.

On August 14, less than a week after Lamont&#x27;s win and nearly four years after the actual event, Cantwell for the first time said she would have voted against the authorization to use force in Iraq if she knew then what she knew in 2006. However, she did so only after hearing her opponent McGavick say that he would have voted against the authorization under those conditions. Cantwell has stated that she had no regrets for her vote in favor of the authorization.

On July 9, anti-war challenger Mark Wilson announced he would abandon his bid, endorse Cantwell, and take a paid position offered by Cantwell&#x27;s campaign, one day after progressive activist and anti-war critic Dal LaMagna had been hired to be the Cantwell campaign&#x27;s co-chair. Initially, Cantwell&#x27;s campaign refused to state how much they were paying Wilson, but under pressure from the media, disclosed that he was receiving $8,000 per month, only slightly less than Cantwell&#x27;s campaign manager Matt Butler, who earns $8,731 per month. The next day, Hong Tran received a call from LaMagna saying they would like her to join their campaign, in a context that she interpreted as a job offer, which she refused. Political commentators, including those at the Seattle Post Intelligencer and one at The Washington Times, expressed their views that Cantwell was attempting to eliminate the viable options anti-war Democrats had to voice their opinion on the war in the upcoming primary by having Wilson join her campaign and then soliciting Tran.

Wilson&#x27;s supporters and journalists expressed surprise at his withdrawal from the race after a 16-month campaign, where he was a sharp critic of the incumbent Senator, who he referred to on his campaign website as a &quot;free-trading corporate elitist&quot; who &quot;bought her seat&quot;, then &quot;alienated and alarmed&quot; her base. When asked by reporters if he still believed what he said about Cantwell during his primary bid, he stated: &quot;I believed in it to a point in order to capitalize on what was already existent, which was a rift within the Democratic Party over the issue of the war.&quot; Both Dixon and Tran publicly doubted that Wilson&#x27;s apparent change of heart was genuine, citing his paid position with the campaign and his initial refusal to disclose his salary.

On September 25, Joshua Frank reported that Dixon was alleging that he had been contacted twice in July by Mark Wilson, who implied that large donations to Dixon&#x27;s non-profit organization, Central House, would be made if he were to withdraw his candidacy before filing. Dixon also claimed that Wilson was not the only Cantwell staffer to contact him, but declined to disclose who the other staff was. Dixon also made this claim on a Democracy Now! broadcast. David Postman of the Seattle Times contacted the Cantwell campaign about the allegations; their spokesperson didn&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t happen but stated that no one on the campaign had been authorized to speak to Dixon about his campaign. The campaign did not allow access to Wilson so he could respond as to whether the conversation took place. Other reporters also had trouble contacting Wilson; Susan Paynter of the Seattle P-I, in an article on his shunning of the media, noted that there had been a widespread assumption after Wilson&#x27;s hire that the intent was to silence him and that his disappearance only reinforced this assumption, calling it &quot;the political equivalent of a farm subsidy.&quot; Paynter also quoted Hong Tran as saying that the reaction to Wilson&#x27;s initial appearances on the campaign trail after he had joined Cantwell were so negative that she was not surprised he disappeared.

On September 19, after her defeat in the Democratic primary, Hong Tran lamented to the Seattle Times of &quot;how undemocratic the Democratic Party really is&quot; saying the state Democratic party had tried to keep her from getting attention, forbidding her from putting up signs at Coordinated Campaign events and not giving her access to the state party voter rolls. Cantwell, whose campaign hired two of her early critics, had also refused to debate Tran. When asked before the primary whether she would endorse the senator if her primary bid proved unsuccessful, Tran had responded, &quot;certainly not.&quot;



From the Washington Secretary of State

In early hypothetical matchups in 2005 compiled by conservative pollster Strategic Vision, Rossi led Cantwell. Republican leadership reportedly pleaded with Rossi to jump into the ring. Rossi declined.

Speculation next centered on Rick White (who had taken Cantwell&#x27;s House seat in 1994), state GOP chair Chris Vance, former Seattle television reporter Susan Hutchinson, and former 8th district Congressional candidate and Republican National Committee member Diane Tebelius. None of those chose to enter the race. Republican leaders finally got behind former Safeco Insurance CEO Mike McGavick.




Cantwell was projected to be the winner right when the polls closed at 11:00 p.m. EST Time.




== West Virginia ==

Incumbent Democrat Robert Byrd won re-election to a ninth term. He was sworn in on January 4, 2007.

Before the 2000 presidential election, West Virginia had been won by the Democratic nominee every time since 1932 (except for the Republican landslides of 1956, 1972, and 1984). In 2000, then Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas won West Virginia&#x27;s five electoral college votes over then Vice President Al Gore of Tennessee by a margin of 52–46. Also in the 2000 election, Republican Shelley Moore Capito, the daughter of Former West Virginia Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr., won a surprise victory over Democrat Jim Humphreys for West Virginia&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District seat to the United States House of Representatives. She would become the first Republican in West Virginia to hold a Congressional office for more than one term since her father in 1969. Before these two major victories for national and West Virginia Republicans, it was difficult to find a Republican who could mount a formidable campaign against Democrats running for public office in West Virginia.

President Bush won West Virginia again in the 2004 presidential election over John F. Kerry, the Democratic junior Senator from Massachusetts by a margin of 56–43. Both Representative Alan Mollohan (D-1st District) and Representative Nick Rahall (D-3rd District) had more formidable challenges from Republicans when compared to 2000 and 2002. Republican Brent Benjamin defeated Democratic incumbent West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Justice Warren McGraw, and Republican Betty Ireland defeated liberal-Democrat Ken Hechler, a former congressman and secretary of state, for West Virginia Secretary of State.

Since 2000, the Republicans have gained seven net seats in both the West Virginia Senate and the West Virginia House of Delegates. However, the Democrats hold 60% of the seats in the Senate and 68% of the seats in the House.

Along with continued majorities in the legislature, Democrats have also had some other victories. Even though both Bush and Capito won their respective offices in 2000, Senator Byrd sailed to an eighth term with 78% of the vote over Republican David Gallaher. Senator John D. Rockefeller, IV, easily won a fourth term to the Senate in 2002 by a margin of 63–37 over Republican Jay Wolfe. In 2000, 2002, and 2004, both Representative Mollohan and Representative Rahall were re-elected by much stronger margins than Capito. In 2004, Republican Monty Warner failed to defeat Democratic West Virginia Secretary of State Joe Manchin for governor.

After the Republicans failed to win the governor&#x27;s race, West Virginia Republican Committee Chairman Kris Warner, the brother of Monty, was put under pressure to resign his post; he did so in May 2005. Wheeling attorney Rob Capehart took his place. (Dr. Doug McKinney of Bridgeport now holds the post.) Another brother of Monty, Kasey, who was appointed by President Bush in 2001, was removed as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia on August 1, 2005. No explanation has been given for his departure and First Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles T. Miller currently represents the district.


Both state and national Republicans chose Shelley Moore Capito as their first choice to challenge Byrd. Early polling showed Byrd with only around a ten-point lead. Capito had even met with National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairwoman Elizabeth Dole, whose husband, Bob Dole, served alongside Byrd as majority and minority leader in the Senate, to discuss a possible run. Despite party leaders pushing for her to run, on October 3, 2005, Capito announced she would seek a fourth term for her congressional seat rather than run against Byrd. She cited the negativity of a possible Byrd-Capito race as a reason for not running. Other reasons for Capito not running include the following: Capito&#x27;s seat is widely considered safe; Capito is rising in House leadership; if Capito ran against Byrd, her seat could possibly have fallen back into the Democratic column; and Capito&#x27;s large amount of contributions from former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay could be brought into question.

After Capito decided not to run, Republicans hoped to recruit Secretary of State Betty Ireland, the first woman elected to the executive branch of West Virginia. On October 27, 2005, however, Ireland announced she would not run against the eight-term senator. She said that the office of Secretary of State should not be used as a political stepping stone. Ironically, Joe Manchin held the office of Secretary of State during his campaign for governor.

Conservative columnist Robert Novak wrote in a September 24, 2005, article that Gale Catlett&#x27;s, the former head coach of the West Virginia University Men&#x27;s Basketball team, name had been floated around as a possible challenger to Byrd. Catlett had in fact talked to West Virginia Republican Committee Chairman Capehart about either running against Byrd or possibly Representative Mollohan. It was also reported that if Capito had run against Byrd, Catlett would seek her seat. However, on November 11, 2005, Catlett decided not to run against Senator Byrd or Representative Mollohan. (A side note: On November 12, 2005, Ohio County Delegate Chris Wakim (R) announced his intentions to run against Representative Mollohan.)

On January 11, 2006, TheHill.com reported that NRSC Chairwoman Dole met with John Raese, the 1984 Republican United States Senate candidate and 1988 Republican Gubernatorial primary-candidate to discuss a possible run for the nomination in May. Raese did file for the primary by the deadline of January 28, 2006.




Byrd was extremely popular as he had approval ratings in the low 60% range. Raese, a millionaire, self-financed his campaign. He spent campaign ads on attacking Byrd.




== Wisconsin ==

Incumbent Democrat Herb Kohl won re-election to a fourth term.

Robert Lorge was the Republican candidate for the seat after being the only Republican candidate to file before the filing deadline on July 11, 2006. Despite receiving no money or support from the State or National Republican party he fared better than Republican Senate candidates in New York, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and was the only major party candidate in 2006 able to deliver votes for under $1 in the Post McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Law era.




Kohl won a majority in every county in the state. Kohl&#x27;s weakest performance in the state was suburban Washington County, Wisconsin, which Kohl won with just 49.6%. Kohl&#x27;s strongest performance was in rural Menominee County, where he won with over 90% of the vote. Vogeler&#x27;s best performance was in Dane County, where she came in third place with over 5%, a county where Lorge had his second weakest performance.

== Wyoming ==

Incumbent Republican Craig Thomas won re-election to a third term. Thomas died 5 months into his term on June 4, 2007, after battling leukemia.



Thomas was a very popular two term incumbent, having a 68% approval rating. Despite doing very well in the polls, Thomas agreed to a debate. An October debate was sponsored by the Casper Star-Tribune and KCWY in Casper. Thomas said the nation has made progress in its energy policy, while Groutage said the nation&#x27;s energy policy has failed because Congress has done more for special interests than the people.




Thomas won at least 56% of the vote in every county in Wyoming.

<doc id="1130298" wikidata="Q3137331" url="?curid=1130298" title="English society">
<text>English society comprises the group behaviour of the English people, and of collective social interactions, organisation and political attitudes in England. The social history of England evidences many social and societal changes over the history of England, from Anglo-Saxon England to the contemporary forces upon the Western world. These major social changes have occurred both internally and in its relationship with other nations. The themes of social history include demographic history, labour history and the working class, women&#x27;s history, family, the history of education in England, rural and agricultural history, urban history and industrialisation.

==Prehistoric society==
The distant past does not offer much information on the structures of society. However, major changes in human behaviour make it likely that society must have changed dramatically. In common with much of Europe, the switch from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to farming around 4000 BC must have heralded an enormous shift in all aspects of human life. Nobody knows what changes may have occurred, and recent evidence of permanent buildings and habitation from 3,000 years ago means that these may still have been gradual shifts. One of the most obvious symbols of change in prehistoric society is Stonehenge. The building of such stone circles, burial mounds and monuments throughout the British Isles seems to have required a division of labour. Builders would have needed to dedicate themselves to the task of monument construction to acquire the necessary skills. Not having time to hunt and farm would make them rely on others to such an extent that specialised farmers would emerge who provided not only for themselves but also for the monument builders. There are many changes in culture seen in prehistoric and later times such as the Beaker people, the Celts, the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons.

== Romans ==

The Roman invasion of Britain in 54 BC probably did not alter society greatly at first, as it was simply a replacement of the ruling class, but numerous, at first minor, ideas would later gain footholds. Certainly, it would not have affected Ireland in the slightest. It is from the Romans, and particularly Tacitus, that we get the earliest detailed written records of Britain and its tribal society. We get fascinating glimpses of society in Britain before the Romans, although only briefly and disparagingly mentioned, particularly the importance of powerful women such as Cartimandua and Boudica. City dwelling was not new to pre-Roman Britain, but it was a lifestyle that the Romans preferred even though available to only a select few Romanised Britons. Romanisation was an important part of the Roman conquest strategy, and British rulers who willingly adopted Roman ways were rewarded as client kings; a good example of this is Togidubnus and his ultramodern Fishbourne Roman Palace. To subdue and control the country, the Romans built a major road network which not only was an important civil engineering project but formed the basis of the country&#x27;s communication links. The Romans brought many other innovations and ideas such as writing and plumbing, but how many of these things were the preserve of the rich or were even lost and re-appropriated at a later date is uncertain.

== Early medieval society ==
The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century is thought to have brought general strife and anarchy to society, but the actual events are not well understood. Archaeology certainly shows a reduction in the expensive goods found before, and the Roman cities began to be abandoned, but much of British society had never had such things. Certainly, numerous peoples took advantage of the absence of Roman power, but how they affected British society is far from clear. The hegemony of Roman rule gave way to a selection of splintered, often competing, societies, including later the heptarchy. Rather than think of themselves as a small part of a larger Roman empire, they reverted to smaller tribal allegiances.

The Anglo-Saxons&#x27; arrival is the most hotly disputed of events, and the extent to which they killed, displaced, or integrated with the existing society is still questioned. What is clear is that a separate Anglo-Saxon society, which would eventually become England with a more Germanic feel, was set up in the south east of the island. These new arrivals had not been conquered by the Romans, but their society was perhaps similar to that of Britain. The main difference was their pagan religion, which the surviving northern areas of non-Saxon rule sought to convert to Christianity. During the 7th century these northern areas, particularly Northumbria, became important sites of learning, with monasteries acting like early schools and intellectuals such as Bede being influential. In the 9th century Alfred the Great worked to promote a literate, educated people and did much to promote the English language, even writing books himself. Alfred and his successors unified and brought stability to most of the south of Britain that would eventually become England.

== Late medieval society ==

After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, society seemed fixed and unchanging for several centuries, but gradual and significant changes were still taking place, the exact nature of which would not be appreciated until much later. The Norman lords spoke Norman French, and in order to work for them or gain advantage, the English had to use the Anglo-Norman language that developed in England. This became a necessary administrative and literary language (see Anglo-Norman literature), but despite this the English language was not supplanted, and after gaining much in grammar and vocabulary began in turn to replace the language of the rulers. At the same time the population of England more than doubled between Domesday and the end of the 13th century, and this growth was not checked by the almost continual foreign warfare, crusades and occasional civil anarchy.

Feudalism, although historians debate the term, is often used to describe medieval society. Basically stated, a lord owns land or a fief which he allows vassals to work in return for their military service. The vast majority of the people were peasants who would work on the vassal&#x27;s fiefs. This or a similar system was the basis of later medieval society. It probably existed in some form in England before the Norman conquest, but the Normans did much to institute it, either replacing existing lords or by becoming &#x27;overlords&#x27; above now-demoted lords. A wealth of information on these social structures can be drawn from the best early surveys of its type, the Domesday Book.

===Church===
The Crusades are one measure of the ever-increasing power of the church in medieval life, with some estimates suggesting that as many as 40,000 clergy were ordained during the 13th century. This is also shown by the spate of cathedral building, common throughout Europe, at the time. These great buildings would often take several generations to complete, spawning whole communities of artisans and craftsmen and offering them jobs for life. A quarter of the land was owned by the Church. Its monasteries owned large tracts of land farmed by peasants.

===Prosperity and population growth===

The two centuries from 1200 to 1400 (when the plague hit) were prosperous. The population grew rapidly, from about 2 million to about 5 million. England remained a mainly rural society, and many agricultural changes, such as crop rotation, kept the countryside profitable. Most people lived by farming, although there were wide variations in patterns of land ownership and the status of peasants. To meet the needs of the growing population more land had to be cultivated. Waste land was exploited and major incursions were made into forests, fen and marsh lands. &quot;High farming&quot; was increasingly practised, whereby the landowner took personal control of his land using hired hands rather than leasing it out. Treatises appeared on the best practices, but the growth of per-acre productivity was small. On good land one acre might produce 17 bushels of wheat (compared to 73 bushels an acre in the 1960s), or 26 of barley or 22 of oats.

After 1300 prosperity was more tenuous owing to a combination of over-population, land shortages and depleted soils. The loss of life in the Great Famine of 1315–1317 shook the English economy severely, and population growth ceased. The first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population, but left plenty of land for the survivors. The agricultural sector shrank, with higher wages, lower prices and shrinking profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system and the advent of the modern farming system of cash rents for lands. Wat Tyler&#x27;s Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381 shook the older feudal order and limited the levels of royal taxation considerably for a century to come.

===Towns===
The increase in population led not only to denser rural areas but also to more and larger towns. Many new towns appeared but most were small. Major cities such as Lincoln, Norwich and Thetford had 4,000–5,000 population, while London grew from 10,000 to nearly 40,000 population and York approached 10,000.

The 13th century experienced a mini-industrial revolution, with the increased use of wind power and changes in the wool industry. Wool, always important to the British economy, was traditionally exported to be processed, but it was now frequently processed in England, creating a variety of extra jobs. The export of cloth continued to increase from the 14th century onwards, and after the closing of the port of Calais (which consumed much of the raw wool) by the Spanish in the late 16th century, cloth became the primary type of wool exported. Many people were finding different roles and responsibilities within English society too, with the growth of common law giving people greater access to the law and the &quot;commons&quot; starting to have a place in the Parliament during Edward I of England&#x27;s time.

===Black Death and population decline===

After many years of growth and gradual change, there was one seismic event which changed British society dramatically. The Black Death in the middle of the 14th century almost halved the population. Whole villages were wiped out by the plague, but rather than destroying society it managed to reinvigorate it. Before the plague there was a large, probably excessive, workforce with not enough productive work available. Overpopulation meant that before the Black Death too many people were competing for scarce resources. Afterwards, the drop in population meant that labourers were in short supply and were paid better. Peasants who had once been confined to a landowner&#x27;s estate now had an incentive to travel to areas without workers. This social mobility was combined with the fact that peasants could charge much more for their services, and this began a switch from indentured labourer to wage earner, which signalled the decline of the feudal system.

The peasants&#x27; new-found freedoms were very worrying to the authorities, who passed laws specifying the maximum that a peasant should be paid, but this had little effect on wages. The first of several sumptuary laws were also made, dictating exactly how people at every level of society should dress and what they could own, in an effort to enforce social distinctions. These new laws, plus a newly levied poll tax which had been calculated on pre-plague population figures, led directly to the Peasants&#x27; Revolt. Although quickly put down, the revolt was an early popular reform movement—a precursor to later, more successful uprisings.

===Chaucer&#x27;s vision===
Geofrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; give an illuminating picture of many of the different people who made up medieval society, although these portraits are limited mainly to the middle classes. The Wife of Bath is one particularly vibrant character within the Tales, and a few years later a real-world equivalent, Margery Kempe, showed in her autobiography that women had an important part in medieval society.

== Tudor society ==

In general terms, the Tudor dynasty period was seen as relatively stable compared to the previous years of almost constant warfare. However, the Reformation caused internal and external social conflict, with a considerable impact on social structure and personality.
Before they were broken up and sold by Henry VIII, monasteries had been one of the important parts of social welfare, giving alms and looking after the destitute, and their disappearance meant that the state would have to adopt this role, which culminated in the Poor Law of 1601. The monasteries were decrepit and no longer were the major educational or economic establishments in the country. After they had gone, many new grammar schools were founded and these, along with the earlier introduction of the printing press, helped to improve literacy.

===Food and agriculture===
The agricultural reforms which had begun in the 13th century accelerated in the 16th century, with enclosure altering the open-field system and denying many of the poor access to land. Large areas of land which had once been &quot;common&quot;, and whose usage had been shared between many people, were now being &quot;enclosed&quot; by the wealthy mainly for extremely profitable sheep farming.

England&#x27;s food supply was plentiful throughout most of the era; there were no famines. Bad harvests caused distress, but they were usually localised. The most widespread came in 1555–57 and 1596–98. In the towns the price of staples was fixed by law; in hard times the size of the loaf of bread sold by the baker was smaller.

The poor consumed a diet largely of bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just arriving at the end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make bread puddings, and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces. At a somewhat higher social level, families ate an enormous variety of meats, especially beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, as well as chickens and ducks. The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some raised their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbours to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost. 
The people discovered new foods (such as the potato and tomato imported from the Americas), and developed new tastes during the era. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as coffee and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces, bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods—such as oranges for the upper class—and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.

At the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large, elaborately prepared meals, usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment. Often they celebrated religious festivals, weddings, alliances and the whims of her majesty.

==17th century==

England was wracked by civil war over religious issues. Prosperity generally continued in both rural areas and the growing towns, as well as the great metropolis of London.

The English Civil War was far from just a conflict between two religious faiths, and indeed it had much more to do with divisions within the one Protestant religion. The austere, fundamentalist Puritanism on the one side was opposed to what it saw as the crypto-Catholic decadence of the Anglican church on the other. Divisions also formed along the lines of the common people and the gentry, and between the country and city dwellers. It was a conflict that was bound to disturb all parts of society, and a frequent slogan of the time was &quot;the world turned upside down&quot;.

In 1660 the Restoration was a quick transition back to the high-church Stuarts. Public opinion reacted against the puritanism of the Puritans, such as the banning of traditional pastimes of gambling, cockfights, the theatre and even Christmas celebrations. The arrival of Charles II—The Merry Monarch—brought a relief from the warlike and then strict society that people had lived in for several years. The theatre returned, along with expensive fashions such as the periwig and even more expensive commodities from overseas. The British Empire grew rapidly after 1600, and along with wealth returning to the country, expensive luxury items were also appearing. Sugar and coffee from the East Indies, tea from India and slaves (brought from Africa to the sugar colonies, along with some enslaved servants in England itself) formed the backbone of imperial trade.

One in nine Englishmen lived in London near the end of the Stuart period. However, plagues were even more deadly in a crowded city—the only remedy was to move to isolated rural areas, as Isaac Newton of Cambridge University did in 1664–66 as the Great Plague of London killed as many as 100,000 Londoners. The fast-growing metropolis was the centre of politics, high society and business. As a major port and hub of trade, goods from all over were for sale. Coffee houses were becoming the centres of business and social life, and it has also been suggested that tea might have played its own part in making Britain powerful, as the antiseptic qualities of tea allowed people to live closer together, protecting them from germs, and making the Industrial Revolution possible. These products can be considered as beginning the consumer society which promoted trade and brought development and riches to society.

Newspapers were new and soon became important tools of social discourse, and the diarists of the time such as Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn are some of the best sources we have of everyday life in Restoration England. Coffee houses grew numerous and were places for middle-class men to meet, read the papers, look over new books and gossip and share opinions. Thomas Garway operated a coffee house in London from 1657 to 1722. He sold tea, tobacco, snuff, and sandwiches. Businessmen met there informally; the first furs from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were auctioned there.

The diet of the poor in the 1660–1750 era was largely bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small quantities of meat and vegetables. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including tea, coffee, and chocolate.

===Crime and punishment===

Historians examining the period 1300–1800 have detected a high level of continuity in their studies of crime and punishment. They have used local records, as well as literary sources, to explore how crime was defined and detected, the changes in the court system, the central importance of elite attitudes toward the poor and dangerous classes, professional criminals, and the amateur and community element in law enforcement before the establishment of police forces in the 19th century. The Black Act 1723, sponsored by Robert Walpole, strengthened the criminal code. It specified over 200 capital crimes, many with intensified punishment. Arson, for example, was expanded to include burning or the threat of burning haystacks. The legal rights of defendants were strictly limited. For example, suspects who refused to surrender within 40 days could be summarily judged guilty and sentenced to execution if apprehended. Local villages were punished if they failed to find, prosecute and convict alleged criminals.

From the left, historians such as E. P. Thompson have emphasized that crime and disorder were characteristic responses of the working and lower classes to the oppressions imposed upon them. Thompson argues that crime was defined and punished primarily as an activity that threatened the status, property and interests of the elites. England&#x27;s lower classes were kept under control by large-scale execution, transportation to the colonies, and imprisonment in horrible hulks of old warships. There was no interest in reformation, the goal being to deter through extremely harsh punishment.

===Agriculture===
Major advances in farming made agriculture more productive and freed up people to work in industry. The British Agricultural Revolution included innovations in technology such as Jethro Tull&#x27;s seed drill which allowed greater yields, while the process of enclosure, which had been altering rural society since the Middle Ages, became unstoppable. The new mechanisation needed much larger fields – the layout of the British countryside with the patchwork of fields divided by hedgerows that we see today.

===Industrial Revolution===
Historians typically date the coming of the Industrial Revolution to Britain in the mid-18th century. Not only did existing cities grow but small market towns such as Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds became cities simply by weight of population.

===Middle class and stability===
The middle class grew rapidly in the 18th century, especially in the cities. At the top of the scale, the legal profession succeeded first, establishing specialist training and associations, and was soon followed by the medical profession. The merchant class prospered with imperial trade. Wahrman (1992) argues that the new urban elites included two types: the gentlemanly capitalist, who participated in the national society, and the independent bourgeois, who was oriented toward the local community. By the 1790s a self-proclaimed middle class, with a particular sociocultural self-perception, had emerged.

Thanks to increasing national wealth, upward mobility into the middle class, urbanisation, and civic stability, Britain was relatively calm and stable, certainly compared with the revolutions and wars which were convulsing the American colonies, France and other nations at the time. The politics of the French Revolution did not translate directly into British society to spark an equally seismic revolution, nor did the loss of the American Colonies dramatically weaken or disrupt Great Britain.

===Religion===
Historians have emphasized the importance of religion, including the domination of the Anglican establishment. The Act of Toleration 1689 granted rights of free religious worship to the non-conformist Protestant sects which had emerged during the Civil War. Baptists, Congregationalists, Methodists, and Quakers were all allowed to pray freely. These groups took the opportunity of the expanding empire and set up in the Thirteen Colonies, where they expanded rapidly after the First Great Awakening.

In response to the religious and moral apathy of the common people, Methodist preachers set up societies divided into &quot;classes&quot;—intimate meetings where individuals were encouraged to confess their sins to one another and to build each other up. They also took part in love feasts which allowed for the sharing of testimony and mutual surveillance of moral behavior. The success of Methodist revivals in reaching the poor and working classes concentrated their attention on spiritual goals rather than political grievances.

===Cultural history===
Scholars have recently been moving toward cultural history rather than social history. The language and self images of people are the chief targets of cultural studies. Of special importance is the concept of an emerging consumer society. Studies of middle- and upper-class manners, tastes, and fashions have proliferated, along with studies of gender, national, and racial identities.

==Victorian era: 1837–1901==
The social changes during the Victorian era were wide-ranging and fundamental, leaving their mark not only upon the United Kingdom but upon much of the world which was under Britain&#x27;s influence during the 19th century. It can even be argued that these changes eclipsed the massive shifts in society during the 20th century; certainly many of the developments of the 20th century have their roots in the 19th. The technology of the Industrial Revolution had a great impact on society. Inventions not only introduced new industries for employment, but the products and services produced also altered society.

Culturally there was a transition away from the rationalism of the Georgian period and toward romanticism and mysticism with regard to religion, social values, and the arts. The era is popularly associated with the &quot;Victorian&quot; values of social and sexual restraint.
=== Population growth and improved health ===
The population of England almost doubled from 16.8 million in 1851 to 30.5 million in 1901. Scotland&#x27;s population also rose rapidly, from 2.8 million in 1851 to 4.4 million in 1901. Ireland&#x27;s population decreased rapidly, from 8.2 million in 1841 to less than 4.5 million in 1901, mostly due to the Great Famine. At the same time, around 15 million emigrants left the United Kingdom in the Victorian era and settled mostly in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Not only did the rapidly expanding British Empire attract immigrants, it also attracted temporary administrators, soldiers, missionaries and businessmen who on their return talked up the Empire as a part of greater Britain.

Environmental and health standards rose throughout the Victorian era; improvements in nutrition may also have played a role, although the importance of this is debated. Sewage works were improved as was the quality of drinking water. With a healthier environment, diseases were caught less easily and did not spread as much. Technology was also improving because the population had more money to spend on medical technology (for example, techniques to prevent death in childbirth so more women and children survived), which also led to a greater number of cures for diseases. However, a cholera epidemic took place in London in 1848–49 killing 14,137, and subsequently in 1853 killing 10,738. This anomaly was attributed to the closure and replacement of cesspits by the modern sewerage systems.

===Class identity and conflicts===
The status of the poor is one area in which huge changes occurred. A good illustration of the differences between life in the Georgian and Victorian eras are the writings of two of England&#x27;s greatest authors, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Both writers held a fascination for people, society and the details of everyday life but in Austen the poor are almost absent, mainly because they were still the rural poor, remote and almost absent from the minds of the middle classes. For Dickens, only a few years later, the poor were his main subject, as he had partly suffered their fate. The poor now were an unavoidable part of urban society and their existence and plight could not be ignored. Industrialisation made large profits for the entrepreneurs of the times, and their success was in contrast not only to the farm workers who were in competition with imported produce but also to the aristocracy whose landowning wealth was now becoming less significant than business wealth. The British class system created an intricate hierarchy of people which contrasted the new and old rich, the skilled and unskilled, the rural and urban and many more.

Some of the first attacks on industrialisation were the Luddites&#x27; destruction of machines, but this had less to do with factory conditions and more to do with machines mass-producing linen much quicker and cheaper than the handmade products of skilled labourers. The army was called to the areas of Luddite activity such as Lancashire and Yorkshire and for a time there were more British soldiers controlling the Luddites than fighting Napoleon in Spain. The squalid, dangerous and oppressive conditions of many of the new Victorian factories and the surrounding communities which rose to service them became important issues of discontent, and the workers began to form trade unions to get their working conditions addressed.

The first trade unions were feared and distrusted by management, and ways were devised to ban them. The most widely known case was that of the Tolpuddle Martyrs of 1834, an early attempt at a union whose members were tried on a spurious charge, found guilty and transported to Australia. The sentence was challenged and they were released shortly afterwards, but unions were still threatened. It was not until the formation of the TUC in 1868 and the passing of the Trade Union Act 1871 that union membership became reasonably legitimate. Many pieces of legislation were passed to improve working conditions, including the Ten Hours Act 1847 to reduce working hours, and these culminated in the Factory Act 1901.

===Rural hardship===
Many of these acts resulted from the blight of Britain&#x27;s agricultural depression. Beginning in 1873 and lasting until 1896, many farmers and rural workers were hard-pressed for a stable income. With the decline in wheat prices and land productivity many countrymen were left looking for any hope of prosperity. Although the British parliament gave substantial aid to farmers and labourers, many still complained that rents were too high, wages too low, and the hours labourers were required to work were too long for their income. As a result, many workers turned to unions to have their concerns heard and, with the acts listed above as proof, were able to achieve some success.
===Communications and travel===

Communication improved rapidly. Stage coaches, canal boats, steam ships and most notably the railways all speeded up the movement of people, goods and ideas. New communication methods were very fast if not instantaneous, including the telegraph, the telephone and the trans-oceanic cable.

Trains opened up leisure destinations, especially seaside resorts. The Bank Holidays Act 1871 created a number of fixed holidays which the middle class could enjoy. Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as Worthing, Brighton, Morecambe and Scarborough began turning them into major tourist centres, and people like Thomas Cook saw arranging for domestic and foreign tourism as a viable business model. Steam ships such as the SS Great Britain and SS Great Western made international travel more common but also advanced trade, so that in Britain it was not just the luxury goods of earlier times that were imported into the country but essentials such as grain and meat from North America and Australia. One more important innovation in communications was the Penny Black, the first postage stamp, which standardised postage to a flat price regardless of distance sent.
===Science and sanitation===
The Victorians were impressed by science and progress, and felt that they could improve society in the same way as they were improving technology. The model town of Saltaire was founded in the 1850s, was one of several created as a planned environment with good sanitation, civic, educational and recreational facilities. It deliberately lacked a pub. Similar sanitation reforms were prompted by the Public Health Acts 1848 and 1869. Progress was made in the crowded, dirty streets of the existing cities. Soap was the main product shown in the relatively new phenomenon of advertising.
Victorians strove to improve society through many charities and relief organisations such as the Salvation Army, the RSPCA and the NSPCC. At the same time there were many people who used Florence Nightingale as a model in working to reform sanitary areas of public life.

===Women and the family===
Reformers organised many movements to obtain greater rights for women; voting rights did not come until the next century. The Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882 meant that women did not lose their right to their own property when they got married and could divorce without fear of poverty, although divorce was frowned upon and very rare during the 19th century. It is too much to claim that the Victorians &quot;invented childhood,&quot; but they deemed it the most significant phase of life. The trend was towards smaller families, probably because of the rise of modern inner-directed families, coupled with lower infant mortality rates and longer life spans. Legislation reduced the working hours of children while raising the minimum working age, and the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870 set the basis for universal primary education.

In local government elections, unmarried women ratepayers received the right to vote in the Municipal Franchise Act 1869. This right was confirmed in the Local Government Act 1894 and extended to include some married women. By 1900, more than 1 million women were registered to vote in local government elections in England.

====Divorce====
In Britain before 1857 wives were under the economic and legal control of their husbands, and divorce was almost impossible. It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps £200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty. The first key legislative victory came with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, which passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases. The process was still quite expensive, at about £40, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a &quot;feme sole,&quot; with full control of her own civil rights. Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
===Religion===
====Church of England expanded roles====

During the 19th century, the established Church of England expanded greatly at home and abroad. It enrolled about half the population, especially in rural areas where the local gentry dominated religious affairs. However it was much weaker in the fast-growing industrial cities. It lost its established status in Ireland. Its funding came largely from voluntary contributions. In England and Wales it doubled the number of active clergyman, and built or enlarged several thousand churches. Around mid-century it was consecrating seven new or rebuilt churches every month. It proudly took primary responsibility for a rapid expansion of elementary education, with parish-based schools, and diocesan-based colleges to train the necessary teachers. In the 1870s, the national government assume part of the funding; in 1880 the Church was educating 73% of all students. In addition there was a vigorous home mission, with many clergy, scripture readers, visitors, deaconesses and Anglican sisters in the rapidly growing cities. Overseas the Church kept up with the expanding Empire. It sponsored extensive missionary work, supporting 90 new bishoprics and thousands of missionaries across the globe.

In addition to local endowments and pew rentals, Church financing came from a few government grants, and especially from voluntary contributions. The result was that some old rural parishes were well funded, and most of the rapidly growing urban parishes were underfunded.

====Evangelican and Nonconformist Protestantism====

The start of the 19th century saw an increase in missionary work and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see Timeline of Christian missions). Both the Evangelical and high church movements sponsored missionaries.

In addition to stressing the traditional Wesleyan combination of &quot;Bible, cross, conversion, and activism&quot;, the revivalist movement sought a universal appeal, designed to reach rich and poor, urban and rural, and men and women. They added work to keep the children their parents brought and to generate literature to spread God&#x27;s message. The first evangelical megachurch, the Metropolitan Tabernacle with its 6000-seat auditorium, was launched in 1861 in London by Charles Spurgeon, a Baptist.

&quot;Christian conscience&quot; was the target chosen by the British Evangelical movement to promote social activism. Evangelicals believed activism in government and the social sphere was an essential method in reaching the goal of eliminating sin in a world drenched in wickedness. The Evangelicals in the Clapham Sect included figures such as William Wilberforce who successfully campaigned for the abolition of slavery.

John Nelson Darby (1800–1882) of the Plymouth Brethren was an Irish Anglican minister who devised modern dispensationalism, an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern Evangelicalism. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God&#x27;s dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.

====Anti-Catholicism====
Anti-Catholic attitudes persisted throughout the 19th century, particularly following the sudden massive Irish Catholic migration to England during the Great Famine.

The forces of anti-Catholicism were defeated by the unexpected mass mobilization of Catholic activists in Ireland, led by Daniel O&#x27;Connell. The Catholics had long been passive but now there was a clear threat of insurrection that troubled Prime Minister Wellington and his aide Robert Peel. The passage of Catholic emancipation in 1829, which allowed Catholics to sit in Parliament, opened the way for a large Irish Catholic contingent. Lord Shaftesbury (1801–1885), a prominent philanthropist, was a pre-millennial evangelical Anglican who believed in the imminent second coming of Christ, and became a leader in anti-Catholicism. He strongly opposed the Oxford movement in the Church of England, fearful of its high church Catholics features. In 1845, he denounced the Maynooth Grant which funded the Catholic seminary in Ireland that would train many priests.

The re-establishment of the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy in England in 1850 by Pope Pius IX, was followed by a frenzy of anti-Catholic feeling, often stoked by newspapers. Examples include an effigy of Cardinal Wiseman, the new head of the restored hierarchy, being paraded through the streets and burned on Bethnal Green, and graffiti proclaiming &#x27;No popery!&#x27; being chalked on walls. Charles Kingsley wrote a vigorously anti-Catholic book &quot;Hypatia&quot; (1853). The novel was mainly aimed at the embattled Catholic minority in England, who had recently emerged from a half-illegal status.

New Catholic episcopates, which ran parallel to the established Anglican episcopates, and a Catholic conversion drive awakened fears of &#x27;papal aggression&#x27; and relations between the Catholic Church and the establishment remained frosty. At the end of the nineteenth century one contemporary wrote that &quot;the prevailing opinion of the religious people I knew and loved was that Roman Catholic worship is idolatry, and that it was better to be an Atheist than a Papist&quot;. 

The Liberal party leader William Ewart Gladstone had a complex ambivalence about Catholicism. He was attracted by its international success in majestic traditions. More important, he was strongly opposed to the authoritarianism of its pope and bishops, its profound public opposition to liberalism, and its refusal to distinguish between secular allegiance on the one hand and spiritual obedience on the other. The danger came when the pope or bishops attempted to exert temporal power, as in the Vatican decrees of 1870 as the climax of the papal attempt to control churches in different nations, despite their independent nationalism. His polemical pamphlet against the infallibility declaration of the Catholic Church sold 150,000 copies in 1874. He urged Catholics to obey the crown and disobey the pope when there was disagreement. on the other hand, when religion ritualistic practices in the Church of England came under attack as too ritualistic and too much akin to Catholicism, Gladstone strongly opposed passage of the Public Worship Regulation Bill in 1874.

==Edwardian Era, 1901–1914==

The Edwardian Era of economic and social prosperity, and political reform, spanned the short reign of Edward VII from 1901 to 1910 as well as early reign of King George V until the start of World War I. The new king had long been the leader of the fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe. Samuel Hynes described the Edwardian era as a &quot;leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun never set on the British flag.&quot;

The Liberals returned to power in the 1906 landslide and made significant reforms. The era was marked by significant shifts in politics among sections of society that had largely been excluded from power, such as labourers, servants, and the industrial working class. Women started to play more of a role in politics.

===Social change and improved health===

Mortality declined steadily in urban England and Wales 1870–1917. Robert Millward and Frances N. Bell looked statistically at those factors in the physical environment (especially population density and overcrowding) that raised death rates directly, as well as indirect factors such as price and income movements that affected expenditures on sewers, water supplies, food, and medical staff. The statistical data show that increases in the incomes of households and increases in town tax revenues helped cause the decline of mortality.

Higher incomes on average permitted higher spending on food, and also on a wide range of health-enhancing goods and services such as medical care. The major improvement in the physical environment was the quality of the housing stock, which rose faster than the population; its quality was increasingly regulated by central and local government. Infant mortality fell faster in England and Wales than in Scotland. Clive Lee argues that one factor was the continued overcrowding in Scotland&#x27;s housing.

====Status of middle-class women====

For middle class housewives, sewing machines enabled the production of ready-made clothing and made it easier for women to sew their own clothes. More generally, argues Barbara Burman, &quot;home dressmaking was sustained as an important aid for women negotiating wider social shifts and tensions in their lives.&quot; Increased literacy gave women wider access to information and ideas. Numerous new magazines appealed to her tastes and helped define femininity.

By 1900 Gender roles shifted as better educated young women made use of the new technology to upgrade their lifestyle and their career opportunities. The inventions of the typewriter, telephone, and new filing systems dramatically increased white collar employment opportunities. So too did the rapid expansion of the school system, and the rapid growth of the new profession of nursing. Education and status led to demands for female roles in the rapidly expanding world of sports.

Women were very active in church affairs, including attendance at services, Sunday school teaching, fund raising, pastoral care, social work and support for international missionary activities. They were almost completely excluded from leadership roles.

=====Women&#x27;s suffrage=====

As middle-class women rose in status, they increasingly supported demands for a political voice. 

There were numerous organisations which did their work quietly. After 1897, they were increasingly linked together by the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) led by Millicent Fawcett. However, front page publicity was seized by the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Founded in 1903, it was tightly controlled by the three Pankhursts, Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928), and her daughters Christabel Pankhurst (1880–1958) and Sylvia Pankhurst (1882–1960).

It specialised in highly visible publicity campaigns such as large parades. This had the effect of energising all dimensions of the suffrage movement. While there was a majority of support for suffrage in Parliament, the ruling Liberal Party refused to allow a vote on the issue; the result of which was an escalation in the suffragette campaign. The WSPU, in dramatic contrast to its allies, embarked on a campaign of violence to publicise the issue, even to the detriment of its own aims.
====Status of working-class women====
=====Birth control and abortion=====
Although abortion was illegal, it was nevertheless a widespread form of birth control. Used predominantly by working-class women, the procedure was used not only as a means of terminating pregnancy, but also to prevent poverty and unemployment. Abortion did not need any prior planning and was less expensive. Newspaper advertisements were used to promote and sell abortifacients indirectly. Not all of society was accepting of contraceptives or abortion, and the opposition viewed both as part of one and the same sin. 
=====Single mothers=====
Single mothers were the poorest sector in society, disadvantaged for at least four reasons. First, women lived longer, often leaving them widowed with children. Second, women had fewer opportunities to work, and when they did find it, their wages were lower than male workers&#x27; wages. Thirdly, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members. Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had limited access to health care.

=====Female servants=====
Edwardian Britain had large numbers of male and female domestic servants, in both urban and rural areas. Middle- and upper-class women relied on servants to run their homes smoothly. Servants were provided with food, clothing, housing, and a small wage, and lived in a self-enclosed social system within their employer&#x27;s house. However, the number of domestic servants fell in the Edwardian era due to fewer young people willing to be employed in this capacity.

===Fashion===
The upper classes embraced leisure sports, which resulted in rapid developments in fashion, as more mobile and flexible clothing styles were needed. During the Edwardian era, women wore a very tight corset, or bodice, and dressed in long skirts. The Edwardian era was the last time women wore corsets in everyday life. According to Arthur Marwick, the most striking change of all the developments that occurred during the Great War was the modification in women&#x27;s dress, &quot;for, however far politicians were to put the clocks back in other steeples in the years after the war, no one ever put the lost inches back on the hems of women&#x27;s skirts&quot;.

Fabrics were usually sweet pea shades in chiffon, mousse line de sore, tulle with feather boas and lace. &#x27;High and boned collars for the day; plunging off shoulder décolleté for the evening&#x27;. The tea gown&#x27;s cut was relatively loose compared to the more formal evening gown, and was worn without a corset. The silhouette was flowing, and was usually decorated with lace or with the cheaper Irish crochet.

Long kid gloves, trimmed hats, and parasols were often used as accessories. Parasols are different from umbrellas; they are used for protection from the sun, rather from the rain, though they were often used as ornamentation rather than for function. By the end of the Edwardian era, the hat grew bigger in size, a trend that would continue in the 1910s.

The Edwardians developed new styles in clothing design. The Edwardian Era saw a decrease in the trend for voluminous, heavy skirts:
* The two-piece dress came into vogue. At the start of the decade, skirts were trumpet-shaped.
* Skirts in 1901 often had decorated hems with ruffles of fabric and lace.
* Some dresses and skirts featured trains.
* Tailored jackets, first introduced in 1880, increased in popularity and by 1900, tailored suits known as tailormades became popular.
* In 1905, skirts fell in soft folds that curved in, then flared out near the hemlines.
* From 1905 – 1907, waistlines rose.
* In 1911, the hobble skirt was introduced; a tight fitting skirt that restricted a woman&#x27;s stride.
* Lingerie dresses, or tea gowns made of soft fabrics, festooned with ruffles and lace were worn indoors.
* Around 1913 women&#x27;s dresses acquired a lower and sometimes V-shaped neckline in contrast to the high collars a generation before. This was considered scandalous by some, and caused outrage among clergy throughout Europe.

===Newspapers===
The turn of the century saw the rise of popular journalism aimed at the lower middle class and tending to deemphasise highly detailed political and international news, which remain the focus of a handful of low-circulation prestige newspapers which reached a small elite. The new press, on the other hand, reached vastly larger audiences by emphasis on sports, crime, sensationalism, and gossip about famous personalities. Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe used his &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to transform the media along the American model of &quot;Yellow Journalism&quot;. P. P. Catterall and Colin Seymour-Ure conclude that: 
== Two world wars ==
===First World War===

What really changed all ranks of English society was the Great War. The army was traditionally a small employer; the regular army stood at only 247,000 at the start of the war. By 1918 there were five million men in the army and the fledgling Royal Air Force, newly formed from the RNAS and the RFC, was about the same size of the pre-war army. The almost three million casualties were known as the &quot;lost generation&quot;, and such numbers inevitably left society scarred; but even so, some people felt their sacrifice was little regarded in Britain, with poems like Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s &quot;Blighters&quot; criticising the ill-informed jingoism of the home front. Conscription brought people of many different classes, and also people from all over the empire, together and this mixing was seen as a great leveller which would only accelerate social change after the war. During the World War, infant mortality fell sharply across the country. J. M. Winter attributes this to the full employment and higher wages paid to war workers.

===1920s===

The social reforms of the previous century continued into the twentieth with the Labour Party being formed in 1900, but this did not achieve major success until the 1922 general election. Lloyd George said after the World War that &quot;the nation was now in a molten state&quot;, and his Housing Act 1919 would lead to affordable council housing which allowed people to move out of Victorian inner-city slums. The slums, though, remained for several more years, with trams being electrified long before many houses. The Representation of the People Act 1918 gave women householders the vote, and in 1928 full equal suffrage was achieved.

After the War, many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. The shortage of servants was felt in the kitchen, but now instead of an experience cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings the ordinary housewife working alone could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Breakfast porridge from branded, more finely milled, oats could now be cooked in two minutes, not 20. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. Street vendors were fewer. Shops were upgraded; the flies were gone as were the open barrels of biscuits and pickles. Groceries and butcher shops carried more bottled and canned goods as well as fresher meat, fish and vegetables. Whereas wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choices, the 1920s saw many new kinds of foods—especially fruits—imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene. Middle classes households now had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.

===Great Depression===
The relatively prosperous 1920s gave way by 1930 to a depression that was part of a worldwide crisis.

Particularly hardest hit were the north of England and Wales, where unemployment reached 70% in some areas. The General Strike was called during 1926 in support of the miners and their falling wages, but it failed. The strike marked the start of the slow decline of the British coal industry. In 1936 two hundred unemployed men walked from Jarrow to London in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor, but the Jarrow March, had little impact and it was not until 1940 that industrial prospects improved. George Orwell&#x27;s book &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; gives a bleak overview of the hardships of the time.

===People&#x27;s War: 1939–1945===

The war was a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; that enlisted every party, class and every region and every interest, with strikingly little dissent. It was started with a &quot;phony war&quot; with little fighting. Fear of bombing led to women and children were moved from London and other cities liable to air raids and evacuated to the country. Most returned some months later and remained in the cities until the end of the war. There were half the number of military casualties in this war than the last, but the improvements in aerial warfare meant that there were many more civilian casualties and a foreign war seemed much closer to home. The early years of the war in which Britain &quot;stood alone&quot; and the Blitz spirit which developed as Britain suffered under aerial bombardment helped pull the nation together after the divisions of the previous decade, and campaigns such as &quot;Dig for Victory&quot; helped give the nation a common purpose. The focus on agriculture to feed the nation gave some people their first introduction to the countryside, and women played an important part in the war effort as the Land Girls.

A half a million women served in the armed forces, led by Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, who donned the ATS soldier&#x27;s uniform as a lorry driver.

==Since 1945==
===Austerity: 1945–1951===
The Labour Party victory in 1945 represented pent-up frustrations. The strong sense that all Britons had joined in a &quot;People&#x27;s War&quot; and all deserved a reward animated voters. But the Treasury was near bankruptcy and Labour&#x27;s nationalization programs were expensive. Prewar levels of prosperity did not return until the 1950s. It was called the Age of Austerity. The most important reform was the founding of the National Health Service on 5 July 1948. It promised to give &quot;cradle to grave&quot; care for everyone in the country, regardless of income.

Wartime rationing continued, and was extended to bread. In the war the government banned ice cream and rationed sweets, such as chocolates and confections; sweets were rationed until 1954. Most people grumbled, but for the poorest, rationing was beneficial, because their rationed diet was of greater nutritional value than their pre-war diet. Housewives organized to oppose the austerity. The Conservatives saw their opening and rebuilt their fortunes by attacking socialism, austerity, rationing, and economic controls, and were back in power by 1951.

===Prosperous 1950s===
As prosperity returned after 1950, Britons became more family centred. Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war. Holiday camps, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s – and people increasingly had money to pursue their personal hobbies. The BBC&#x27;s early television service was given a major boost in 1953 with the coronation of Elizabeth II, attracting an estimated audience of twenty million, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950 1% owned television sets; by 1965 75% did. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.

Small neighbourhood stores were increasingly replaced by chain stores and shopping centres, with their wide variety of goods, smart-advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and ribbon developments springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the green belt to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.

===1960s===
The 1960s saw dramatic shifts in attitudes and values led by youth. It was a worldwide phenomenon, in which British rock musicians, especially The Beatles, played an international role. The generations divided sharply regarding the new sexual freedom demanded by youth who listened to bands like The Rolling Stones.

Sexual morals shifted towards greater acceptance of sexual behaviors and identities that had been considered taboo or immoral. One notable event was the publication of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; by Penguin Books in 1960. Although first printed in 1928, the release in 1960 of an inexpensive mass-market paperback version prompted a court case. The prosecuting council&#x27;s question, &quot;Would you want your wife or servants to read this book?&quot; highlighted how far society had changed, and how little some people had noticed. The book was seen as one of the first events in a general relaxation of sexual attitudes. Other elements of the sexual revolution included the development of The Pill, Mary Quant&#x27;s miniskirt and the 1967 legalisation of homosexuality. There was a rise in the incidence of divorce and abortion, and a resurgence of the women&#x27;s liberation movement, whose campaigning helped secure the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act in 1975.

The 1960s were a time of greater disregard for the &quot;establishment,&quot; with a satire boom led by people who were willing to attack their elders. Pop music became a dominant form of expression for the young, and bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were seen as leaders of youth culture. Youth-based subcultures such as the mods, rockers, hippies and skinheads became more visible.

Reforms in education led to the effective elimination of the grammar school. The rise of the comprehensive school was aimed at producing a more egalitarian educational system, and there were ever-increasing numbers of people going into higher education.

In the 1950s and 1960s, immigration of people to the United Kingdom, mainly from former British colonies in the Caribbean, India and Pakistan, began to escalate, leading to racism. Dire predictions were made about the effect of these new arrivals on British society (most famously Enoch Powell&#x27;s Rivers of Blood speech), and tension led to a few race riots. In the longer term, many people with differing cultures have successfully integrated into the country, and some have risen to high positions.

===1980s===
One important change during the 1980s was the opportunity given to many to buy their council houses, which resulted in many more people becoming property owners in a &quot;stakeholder society.&quot; At the same time, Conservative Margaret Thatcher weakened her bitter enemy, the trade unions.

The environmentalism movements of the 1980s reduced the emphasis on intensive farming, and promoted organic farming and conservation of the countryside.

Religious observance declined notably in Britain during the second half of the 20th century, even with the growth of non-Christian religions due to immigration and travel (see Islam in the UK). Church of England attendance has particularly dropped, although charismatic churches like Elim and AOG are growing. The movement to Keep Sunday Special seemed to have lost at the beginning of the 21st century.

=== 1990s and the new millennium ===
Following on from the resurgence of economic liberalism in the 1980s, the last decade of the 20th century was noted for a greater embrace of social liberalism within British society, largely attributed to the greater influence of the generation born in the socially transformative 1960s. In 1990, 69% of Britons surveyed believed homosexuality was morally wrong; by the end of the decade this had fallen to below half, and the legal age of consent for homosexual sexual activity had been lowered to 16, in line with heterosexual sex.

The death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 was also observed to have demonstrated the way in which social attitudes towards mourning had changed, with the unprecedented mass public outpourings of grief that characterised the days after her death being remarked upon as reflecting a change in the national psyche.

Growing disparity in the relative affluence of those who have benefitted and those &#x27;left behind&#x27; from the deindustrialisation and globalisation of the economy was attributed as one of the primary factors behind the surprise victory of the &#x27;leave&#x27; campaign in the 2016 European Union membership referendum, and began wider discourse on the emergence of &#x27;two countries&#x27; within England that represented greatly differing social attitudes and outlooks.

==Historiography==
The social history of the medieval period was primarily developed by Eileen Power, H. S. Bennett, Ambrose Raftis, Rodney Hilton, and Sylvia Thrupp before the rise of the New Social History in the 1960s.

Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of English rural history and focuses on an &quot;orthodox&quot; school dealing chiefly with the economic history of agriculture. The orthodox historians made &quot;impressive progress&quot; in quantifying and explaining the growth of output and productivity since the agricultural revolution. A challenge came from a dissident tradition that looked chiefly at the negative social costs of agricultural progress, especially enclosure. In the late 20th century there arose a new school, associated with the journal &quot;Rural History&quot;. Led by Alun Howkins, it links rural Britain to a wider social history. Burchardt calls for a new countryside history, paying more attention to the cultural and representational aspects that shaped 20th-century rural life.

<text>Sleep inertia is a physiological state of impaired cognitive and sensory-motor performance that is present immediately after awakening. It persists during the transition of sleep to wakefulness, where an individual will experience feelings of drowsiness, disorientation and a decline in motor dexterity. Impairment from sleep inertia may take several hours to dissipate. In the majority of cases, morning sleep inertia is experienced for 15 to 30 minutes after waking.

Sleep inertia is of concern with decision-making abilities, safety-critical tasks and the ability to operate efficiently soon after awakening. In these situations, it poses an occupational hazard due to the cognitive and motor deficits that may be present.

==Symptoms==
* &quot;Grogginess&quot;, as defined by a drowsy or disoriented state in which there is a dampening of sensory acuity and mental processing.
* Impaired motor dexterity and decrease in cognitive ability. These gross impairments may be responsible for the associated increase in reaction time and drop in attentiveness.
* Deficits in spatial memory
* Reports of heightened subjective fatigue
* Reduced vigilance and a desire to go back to sleep
These symptoms are expressed with the greatest intensity immediately after waking, and dissipate following a period of extended wakefulness. The duration of symptoms varies on a conditional basis, with primary expression during the first 15–60 minutes after waking and potentially extending for several hours. Tasks that require more complex cognitive operations will feature greater deficits as compared to a simple motor task; the accuracy of sensory and motor functioning is more impaired by sleep inertia as compared to sheer speed. In order to measure the cognitive and motor deficiencies associated with sleep inertia, a battery of tests may be utilized, including: the psychomotor vigilance task, descending subtraction task (DST), auditory reaction time task, and the finger tapping task.

==Causes==

* Studies have shown that abrupt awakening during stage 3 sleep, slow-wave sleep (SWS), produces more sleep inertia than awakening during sleep stages 1, 2 or REM sleep.
* Prior sleep deprivation increases the percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Therefore, an individual who was previously sleep deprived will have a greater chance of experiencing sleep inertia.
* Adenosine levels in the brain progressively increase with sleep deprivation, and return to normal during sleep. Upon awakening with sleep deprivation, high amounts of adenosine will be bound to receptors in the brain, neural activity slows down, and a feeling of tiredness will result.
* Studies show that individuals express a lack of blood flow to the brain upon awakening. Levels of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) will take up to 30 minutes to increase and reach daytime levels. Studies using advanced imaging have shown that cerebral blood flow will return to waking levels in the brainstem and thalamus first. Then, after 15 minutes, the brain&#x27;s anterior cortical regions receive normal daytime blood flow. This 15 minute time period corresponds to the sleep inertia period.
*Studies show that drinking alcoholic beverages in the evening causes physiological distress upon wake up. This phenomenon is known colloquially as a hangover.

== Treatments and countermeasures ==

There has been a great deal of research into potential methods to relieve the effects of sleep inertia. The demand for remedies is driven by the occupational hazards of sleep inertia for employees who work extended shifts such as medical professionals, emergency responders, or military personnel. The motor functioning and cognitive ability of these professionals who must immediately respond to a call can pose a safety hazard in the workplace. Below are some of the various methods that have been suggested to combat sleep inertia.

=== Napping ===
When a person is sleep deprived, re-entering sleep may provide a viable route to reduce mental and physical fatigue, but it can also induce sleep inertia. In order to limit sleep inertia, one should avoid waking from the deeper stages of slow-wave sleep. The onset of slow-wave sleep occurs approximately 30 minutes after falling asleep, therefore a nap should be limited to under 30 minutes to prevent waking during slow-wave sleep and enhancing sleep inertia. Furthermore, self-awakening from a short nap was shown to relieve disorientation of sleep inertia as opposed to a forced awakening, but these results may warrant more research into the nature of arousal after sleep periods.

=== Caffeine ===
Caffeine is a xanthine derivative that can cross the blood–brain barrier, as well as the most widely-consumed stimulant compound, present in therapeutic quantities in a variety of food and drink, including tea, coffee, soft drinks and chocolate. The caffeine present in coffee or tea exerts its stimulating action by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. By antagonizing the adenosine receptors, caffeine limits the effects of adenosine buildup in the brain and increases alertness and attentiveness. Previous research has shown that coupled with a short nap, consuming caffeine prior to the nap can alleviate the effects of sleep inertia. Nonetheless, individual degree of consumption and tolerance to caffeine may be responsible for variation in its efficacy to reduce sleep inertia symptoms.

=== Light ===
The natural light provided by the sunrise may contribute to a reduction in sleep inertia effects. Research simulating increase of light at dawn was shown to potentiate the cortisol awakening response (CAR). The CAR is a spike in blood cortisol levels following awakening, and is associated with the return to an alert cognitive state.

=== Other ===
Some other interventions that could potentially minimize the effects of sleep inertia are sound and temperature. There is moderate evidence that the presence of mild sounds and a sharp decrease in the temperature of the extremities may independently reverse sleep inertia symptoms. Sound, especially music, is thought to increase attentiveness and decrease one&#x27;s subjective feeling of sleepiness upon awakening. A drop in temperature of the extremities may prevent heat loss upon awakening, facilitating the return of core body temperature to homeostatic daytime levels.

<text>Sir Cornelius Vermuyden (; 1595 – 11 October 1677) was a Dutch engineer who introduced Dutch land reclamation methods to England. 

Vermuyden was commissioned by the Crown to drain Hatfield Chase in the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire.

In the 1650s, he directed major projects to drain The Fens of East Anglia, introducing the innovation of constructing washes, to allow periodic flooding of the area by excess waters.

==Early life and education==
Cornelius was the son of Gillis Vermuyden and Sarah Werkendet. He was born in 1595 in Haestinge on the Isle of Tholen in the Zeeland province of the Dutch Republic. He trained in the Netherlands as an engineer, learning Dutch techniques for controlling water and draining marshland.

==Career in England==
By the period of 1621 to 1623, Vermuyden was working in England, where his first projects were on the River Thames, repairing a sea wall at Dagenham and working to reclaim Canvey Island, Essex. The latter project was financed by Joas Croppenburg, a Dutch haberdasher to whom Vermuyden was related by marriage.

This, or perhaps work at Windsor, brought him to the notice of Charles I, who commissioned him in 1626 to drain Hatfield Chase in the Isle of Axholme, Lincolnshire. The King was Lord of the four principal manors there: Hatfield, Epworth, Crowle and Misterton, as well as 13 of the adjacent manors, and he wanted to expand the cultivable area. Vermuyden was to receive one third of the drained land, most of which had previously been commons, as recompense for his investment. To finance the drainage project, he sold shares in this land to other investors, including some fellow Dutchmen. Some French and Walloon Protestant refugees also settled in the area as landowners or tenants. The King intended to enclose one third of the common fen in his right of &quot;improvement&quot; as the Lord of the Manor, leaving one-third for those local residents who had common rights of pasturage in the fens.

The local people were upset by the project, particularly those of the Manor of Epworth, whose lord had already enclosed part of the commons in the 14th century. He had later signed a legal document giving up all subsequent rights of enclosure within the manor. As with other fen drainage schemes at the time, the locals did not oppose drainage &quot;per se,&quot; but were outraged about the large enclosures of their common pasture and turbary fens. This threatened their commons rights and livelihoods, as they depended on the fens for pasturage and for peat for burning as fuel. From 1627, the richer members of the community challenged the project in court by lawsuits, even as large groups of commoners (not necessarily poor people, but including some substantial farmers) rioted against the works and the enclosures. Because the legal position of the commoners of Epworth was unique, the legal debate over the drainage and enclosures lasted into the eighteenth century.

Vermuyden was knighted in 1629 for his work, and became a British citizen in 1633.

In 1631 he built the Horseshoe Sluice on the tidal river at Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire at a cost of £8,000, by a &quot;little Army of Artificers Venting, contriving and acting outlandish devises&quot;

The work on Hatfield Chase was only partially successful: the straightening of the river Don and outlet into the Aire caused flooding in Fishlake, Sykehouse and Snaith. As a result of a lawsuit in 1633, Vermuyden dug the Dutch River, which provided a direct route from the Don to the River Ouse at Goole. It required him to deplete most of the land that he had acquired in the Chase. The same year he bought of land in Sedgemoor on the Somerset Levels and Malvern Chase in Worcestershire; he also entered into a partnership in the lead mines in Wirksworth, which he drained by means of a sough.

== The Fens ==
Contrary to popular belief, Vermuyden was not involved with the draining of the &quot;Great Fen&quot; in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk in the 1630s. He did not participate until the second phase of construction in the 1650s. This area of marshland was naturally drained by a labyrinth of rivers. It had been inadequately maintained since before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537 during the English Reformation, as the monasteries had been chiefly responsible in the region for keeping the channels clear. The initial plan for the drainage was based on a proposal by John Hunt in 1604-1605, to construct a new river long from Earith to Denver, shortening the length of the River Great Ouse by many miles. It was eventually named the Bedford River (subsequently Old Bedford River) after Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, who was the chief Adventurer and financier. The project created or improved eight other channels. The operation was judged as substantially complete in 1637. It was criticized for its limited goal to provide &quot;summer lands&quot;, leaving the land subject to winter flooding.

The Merchant Adventurers had been offered by the Crown as the reward for their work. This settlement was disrupted: first by the riots, which erupted against the enclosures (and that occurred periodically into the 1650s), and second, by the King. He reversed the granting of Bedford&#x27;s contract and declared himself as the principal in the project, taking and leaving the other parties with only .

At this time, Vermuyden was recruited to participate in the Great Level, as in 1637 he wrote a &quot;Discourse Touching the Draining of the Great Fennes&quot; for the King (it was not published until 1642). In it, he proposed two innovations to the drainage scheme: washes – areas of land allowed to flood in periods of bad weather to absorb the extra water that cannot drain to the sea – and a catchdrain around the eastern edge of the fen. The washes were constructed as part of the second phase of drainage in the 1650s, but the catchdrain was not developed until the early 1960s. This catchdrain follows the contours of the western edge of the hilly brecklands where they rise above the fen, commencing in the south at Mildenhall through Hockwold cum Wilton northwards to Denver Sluice. At the latter village the River Little Ouse flows westwards off the brecks from Brandon enclosed within high embankments, over an aqueduct many feet higher than the catchment drain and surrounding farmland. Thus illustrating many of the anachronistic but brilliant features (in engineering terms), the work of Vermuyden commenced. 
Charles I appointed Vermuyden as his agent for the draining on 19 September 1639, but his government did not approve the plan until 5 August. In a precarious position with all three of its kingdoms, the Crown lacked both sufficient funds and attention to pay for the works in the Great Level, but it authorized Vermuyden to start. He widened the River Nene below Horseshoe Sluice, banking the north side of Morton&#x27;s Leam. Beginning on the south, he set a new sluice, known as Shire Drain, and cut a new channel at the mouth of the Nene through the salt marshes to the sea. Vermuyden was still working in the Great Level as of May 1642, but was by then responding to the House of Lords, rather than the beleaguered King. Having received perhaps less than £5000, the engineer was continually in arrears for the wages of his workmen.

During the Civil War, the drainage project was halted by the chaos of war. The original financiers – now headed by Bedford&#x27;s heir William – began to seek an Act of Parliament to overturn the King&#x27;s takeover of their project and to gain restoration of all of the first awarded in January 1630/31. By 29 May 1649, a few months after the King&#x27;s execution, they had succeeded; an Act of Parliament (later known as &quot;The Pretended Act&quot;) restored them to the undertaking and gave their claim to the enclosures the force of law.

Before this time, Vermuyden&#x27;s activities are not clear; there is some inconclusive evidence that one of his nephews may have acted as a colonel of horse in the parliamentary army, alongside Oliver Cromwell in the Eastern Association army. But with the beginning of the second phase of Bedford-led construction, Vermuyden was again appointed as the director of the works in January 1649/50.

This second phase included continuing the work of both the first and the King&#x27;s (1.5 phase). In addition, he dredged the New Bedford River (with a large area of wash between it and the Bedford River) and the Forty Foot Drain. He established Denver Sluice to stop tides and flood water from depositing silt into the Great Ouse to the east of Ely. The work did not include his projected &quot;cutoff channel,&quot; which was designed to take flood water from the southern rivers, the Wissey, Little Ouse and Lark, away from Denver. As a result, the area suffered continued flooding, which was not controlled until a project of the early 1960s. Due to the high cost of labour, and the continuing unpopularity of the project among the local inhabitants, the government provided Vermuyden with Scottish and Dutch prisoners of war (after the Battle of Dunbar in 1650) and the start of the war with the Dutch respectively) as labourers in this phase of construction.

Vermuyden&#x27;s relationship with the other adventurers was never easy and, by 1655, they had parted company altogether. Several other of his initiatives failed, including a proposal for a treaty between England and the States-General of the Netherlands which he made to Cromwell. In addition, Vermuyden was unable to gain support to drain his areas of Sedgemoor and Malvern Chase.

==Personal life==
Vermuyden married Katherine Lapps on 16 November, 1623, at St Mary&#x27;s, Rotherhythe. One son, Cornelius Vermuyden Jr., became an Original Fellow of the Royal Society in 1663. He had a total of nine children with Katherine, including Charles, Deborah, Elizabeth, and John. His second wife was Dionysia Stonhouse. 

Vermuyden lived in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden in 1647 and had a home in Kelfield, North Lincolnshire. 

Vermuyden died on 11 October 1677 in London.

==Reclamation results==
Despite the initial success of the reclamation, the engineers did not understand enough about the ecology of the fens. The drying of the land caused the peat to shrink greatly, lowering the remaining land below the height of the drainage channels and rivers. This caused the reclaimed farmland to become vulnerable again to flooding. By the end of the 17th century, much of the reclaimed land was regularly flooded. This continued until the development of steam-powered pumps in the early 19th century. The drop in the land level can be seen at the pumps near Ramsey Forty Foot, where animal-powered pumps, steam pumps and now fossil-fuel pumps are all co-located, at different heights. They demonstrate both the development of technology and the resulting decline in land levels. Prickwillow Museum has a large pumping engine in working order, but not actively used.

==Legacy and honours==

Vermuyden has several locations named after him, including:
*Cornelius Vermuyden School and Arts College, Canvey Island, Essex.
*Vermuyden Hotel, Goole, East Riding of Yorkshire.
*The Vermuyden Tea Rooms, Thorne, South Yorkshire. 
*Vermuyden Medical Centre, Thorne, South Yorkshire.
*Vermuyden Road, Moorends, Doncaster, South Yorkshire. 
He is also the namesake for the Vermuyden Group of South Yorks, a Long Distance Walkers Association based in South Yorkshire, and the Vermuyden Concert Band, the most senior Saturday afternoon band at William Appleby Music Centre in Doncaster. His motto (&quot;Nothing Without Work&quot;) was adopted as the official motto of South Cambridgeshire District Council. The motto was adopted by No. 3 Group RAF and it appears in a memorial window in Ely Cathedral, installed in their honour.

Due to the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the Great Fire of London in 1666 (some blamed the Dutch for), Cornelius Vermuyden decided to alter his surname, which over the years was further altered to what is today the surname Youdan, to which his descendants still live in the East Anglian region today.

<doc id="1130315" wikidata="Q7183016" url="?curid=1130315" title="Philemon Ewer">
<text>There were a number of shipbuilders and shipwrights called Philemon Ewer
in the villages of Bursledon and Hamble in the River Hamble area of Hampshire, England during the 18th century.

== The Master Shipbuilder ==

The &#x27;Master&#x27; shipbuilder was Philemon Ewer (19 July 1702 – 13 December 1750). He was a
timber merchant and builder of small boats but gained an opportunity through
the outbreak of the &#x27;War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear&#x27; to build Men of War for the
British government in 1739.

He also had a shipyard in East Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

He was buried at St Leonards in Bursledon on 16 December 1750 and has an elaborate memorial which records:

In Memory of MR PHILEMON EWER, who died the 13th day of December
A.D. 1750 aged 49 Years. During the late war with France &amp; Spain
He build Seven large Ships of war for His Majesty&#x27;s Service.
In the Execution of that important Trust He gained, and deserved,
the Reputation of an ingenious Artist and excellent workman
and an honest Man. All his Undertakings were crowned with Success,
And all his Industry justly rewarded With a fair Character &amp; a plentiful
Fortune; The first of which he left for ye Imitation
The second for the Support &amp; Enjoyment Of his numerous Family;
who in Gratitude erected This Monument A:D: 1754

His seven ships were:



He also built a large house in the village from the proceeds. It was called &#x27;Elm Lodge&#x27; at the time but is now known as &#x27;Greyladyes&#x27; and is home to the &#x27;Greyladyes Arts Foundation&#x27; Google Maps Link.

There is also an 18th-century house called &#x27;Ewers&#x27; on Lands End Road in Bursledon that was owned by the family. Google Maps link

<doc id="1130321" wikidata="Q4352792" url="?curid=1130321" title="HMS Gorgon (1914)">
<text>HMS &quot;Gorgon&quot; and her sister ship were two monitors originally built as coastal defence ships for the Royal Norwegian Navy, as HNoMS &quot;Nidaros&quot; and respectively, by Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick. She was purchased from Norway at the beginning of the First World War, but was not completed until 1918 although she had been launched over three years earlier. She engaged targets in Occupied Flanders for the last several months of the war and fired the last shots of the war against such targets on 15 October 1918. She was used as a target ship after several attempts to sell her had fallen through before being sold for scrap in 1928.

==Background==
&quot;Nidaros&quot; was ordered by Norway in 1913 to supplement the older and classes of coastal defense ships. She would have been known in Norway as P/S &quot;Nidaros&quot;; P/S stands for &quot;Panserskip&quot; (&quot;armoured ship&quot;), while &quot;Nidaros&quot; was the old name for the Norwegian city of Trondheim. However, when the First World War broke out, the Royal Navy requisitioned most warships under construction in Britain for foreign powers and refunded the two-thirds of the &quot;Bjørgvin&quot;″s £370,000 purchase price already paid by the Norwegians.

==Construction and description==
&quot;Nidaros&quot; was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick on 11 June 1913 and launched on 9 June 1914. She was renamed as Gorgon, after an earlier breastwork monitor of 1871. Her completion was greatly delayed by the modifications made by the British, which included modifying the boilers to use both oil and coal and conversion of 12 double-bottom tanks to carry oil. This work began on 9 January 1915, but was suspended the following May, when it was estimated that only another 10–12 months of work remained, to allow for faster progress to be made on the large light cruisers and that were building in Armstrong&#x27;s Naval Yard downriver. In September 1917, work was resumed on a new design that added a large anti-torpedo bulge along about 75% of the hull&#x27;s length, suppression of the torpedo tubes and the guns planned by the Norwegians, and a large tripod mast was fitted behind the single funnel to carry the directors for both the and guns. Both of these guns had to be relined to use standard British ammunition and the mount for the 9.2-inch gun was modified to give a maximum elevation of 40° which gave the gun a maximum range of . Addition of the bulges cost in speed, but prevented the extra weight resulting from all of these changes from deepening her draft. She was finally completed on 4 June 1918.

&quot;Gorgon&quot; displaced at deep load as built, with a length of , a beam of at maximum, although her main hull only had a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines, which developed a total of from four Yarrow watertube boilers and gave a maximum speed of .

She was armed with two 9.2-inch guns arranged in two single-gun turrets, one turret each fore and aft. Her secondary armament consisted of four six-inch guns, also in single gun turrets, two of which superfired over the 9.2-inch turrets and the others were positioned on each side of the superstructure. One anti-aircraft gun was mounted on each center-line six-inch turret. She also carried four 3-pounder and four 2-pounder guns on high-angle mounts.

==Service==
&quot;Gorgon&quot; arrived at Dover on 6 June 1918 where she spent the next five weeks working up. Her first engagement was on 26 July when she fired eight rounds at a range of at a German howitzer battery to calibrate her guns and fire control system, which provoked a response from the German gun of Batterie Pommern south of Ostend. Three days later, she accompanied on a bombardment of &quot;Batterie&quot; &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. She spent the next month and a half either out on patrol in the English Channel or preparing for the bombardment scheduled for the end of September in support of a major offensive along the coast.

At daybreak on 28 September 1918, &quot;Gorgon&quot;, in company with , anchored about off De Panne, Belgium and opened fire about 7:15 on a bridge at Snaeskerke, Belgium at a range of . Conditions were not good as both wind and tide were against her. &quot;Gorgon&quot;″s stern anchor cable parted and she swung around on her bow anchor so that only her rear turret could bear on the target. No aircraft were made available to spot for her so there was little chance of a hit and she only fired eleven rounds. She, and the other monitors, were attacked several times during the day by German aircraft with little effect and several coast defense batteries attempted to engage them through the smokescreen put up by the motor launches supporting the operation. She fired thirteen shells the next day in another attempt to destroy the bridge and claimed one hit although this was not confirmed by subsequent observations.

On 14 October, she repeated the experience, except that her target was now the Middelkerke batteries. She fired 41 rounds during the morning at a range of , but she accompanied Vice-Admiral Keyes in the destroyer in a reconnaissance mission to see if the Germans were still holding the coast in strength. The fire of the Tirpitz and Raversyde Batteries soon disabused them of any notions to the contrary and &quot;Gorgon&quot; was forced to turn away at maximum speed (), which was faster than she&#x27;d made on trials, when they straddled her and hit her with splinters from the near-misses. The following day she returned to her original target and fired 30 rounds in 20 minutes. These were the last shots of the war fired against German batteries on the Belgian coast.

She was sent to Portsmouth after the end of the war where she was made available to investigate the cause of her sister ship &quot;Glatton&quot;″s magazine explosion. She was moved to Devonport as a temporary tender to the stone frigate Vivid in April 1919. She was paid off on 31 August and joined the Reserve Fleet in September. She was offered back to the Norwegians, but they rejected her as unsuitable to their requirements, especially since she was now too broad for their dock at Horten. Several attempts were made to sell her, but she was disarmed in 1922 and used as a target ship to evaluate the effects of bombs bursting underwater near a ship and the effects of six-inch gunfire. She was finally sold for scrap on 26 August 1928 and broken up at the former naval dockyard at Pembroke.

<doc id="1130329" wikidata="Q7190640" url="?curid=1130329" title="Pichi Richi Railway">
<text>Pichi Richi Railway is a narrow-gauge heritage railway in the southern Flinders Ranges of South Australia between Quorn and Port Augusta. For much of its length the line lies in the picturesque Pichi Richi Pass, where the line was completed in 1879 as work proceeded north to build a railway to the &quot;Red Centre&quot; of Australia – the Central Australia Railway. 

The Commonwealth Railways ran trains through the pass until 1970, when it ceased services. There were proposals to demolish the line including the bridges and dry stone walls, but the Quorn Progress Association recognised their heritage value and significance. Lobbying by local and distant supporters reached Mr. Keith Smith, Commissioner of the Commonwealth Railways.

On 22 July 1973, the not-for-profit Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society Inc. was incorporated, initially to ensure conservation of the 1878 dry stone walls and the bridges in the Pichi Richi Pass. It became evident that the prospect of operating heritage trains was possible and after undertaking restoration of deteriorated sections of the line, the Society operated its first trains to Summit, just 12 months later. 

Following further track repairs, trains were able to travel to Pichi Richi, and later to Woolshed Flat. After relaying, the line was restored to Stirling North – at that time the western terminus of the line. 

A newly built extension to Port Augusta was opened in 2001. 

The Society continues to be completely managed and staffed by its volunteer members and operates its own restored steam and diesel hauled trains on a variety of services between March and November each year.   

==Background==
The line was built initially to service mining in the Flinders Ranges, as part of the South Australian Railways&#x27; &quot;Port Augusta and Government Gums Railway&quot;. It started in 1878 at Port Augusta, proceeded through the Pichi Richi Pass (being opened at Quorn in 1879), and reached the initial terminus at Government Gums (now named Farina) in 1882. The line was extended to Marree (then named Hergott Springs) in 1884 and Oodnadatta in 1891. In keeping with the intention to extend it to become a north–south transcontinental line, it was named the &quot;Great Northern Railway&quot; in 1882. 

When the Commonwealth Railways took over operations in 1926 it had the more prosaic name, given a year earlier, &quot;Central Australia Railway&quot;. Completed as far as Stuart (renamed in 1930 as Alice Springs) near the centre of Australia, the line never went further north. Nevertheless, it served for a century as a lifeline for isolated outback communities, a vital link for supplies in World War II, and the setting for the famous passenger train, &quot;The Ghan&quot;. The Pichi Richi section also became the feeder route to the east–west Trans-Australian Railway from 1917 to 1937. It had the steepest gradients of the whole route, necessitated by the refusal of decision makers to heed the advice of surveyors and engineers to stay west of the Flinders Ranges, giving priority instead to servicing promising copper prospects and expected agricultural wealth in the locality. This source of decades of operational nuisance and expense had become, in the lines old age, the source of enjoyment for travellers, as locomotives worked hard to ascend the grades.


The headquarters of PRRPS is at the Quorn railway station. Restoration and repair work continues to be undertaken by volunteers at the carriage restoration and locomotive workshop. Trains operate through the Pichi Richi Pass to Woolshed Flat and Port Augusta and out of Port Augusta to Quorn. The volunteer organisation has fully restored a fleet of South Australian Railways (SAR), Commonwealth Railways (CR) and Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) steam and diesel locomotives, passenger and freight rolling stock.

Pichi Richi (1974) (elevation ), Woolshed Flat (1979) (elevation ) and Stirling North (1999) on the original alignment, and to Port Augusta (2001) on a new alignment between Stirling North and Port Augusta.

Pichi Richi is the name of the pass through which the railway travels and is also the name of the former township located in the Pass, after which the Society is named. The name Pichi Richi is believed to come from the region being a traditional centre in the production of pituri, a mixture of leaves and ash chewed as a stimulant by the First Nations people in Australia.

==Current operations==
PRRPS continues to expand the type and number of services as more rolling stock and track is restored and rehabilitated.

The Afghan Express is a return trip to Quorn from Port Augusta (78 kilometres return). This train usually consists of Ghan carriages from the 1920s and is often hauled, wherever possible, by an original Ghan steam locomotive, NM25, and recreates the type of travel experienced on the Ghan in the 1930s and 1940s.
A shorter journey, the Pichi Richi Explorer is a return service to Woolshed Flat departing from Quorn (32 kilometres return). Travel on this train is either in South Australian Railway carriages circa 1900 to 1915 hauled by a steam locomotive, or in a 1928 SAR diesel railcar. The use of older SAR rolling stock on this train replicates what it was like to travel by country rail in South Australia in the very early 1900s to the 1960s. Much of this rolling stock was in service until the end of narrow gauge passenger operations by the South Australian Railways. 

Steam Motor Coach No. 1, also known affectionately as the &quot;Coffee Pot&quot; is a unique railcar and the last operating example of its type worldwide. Built in 1906, this ornate Edwardian-era steam railcar has been restored by PRR volunteers. It is used for selected services during the train running season, the SMC carries a small number of passengers (in first and second class) on board for a Coffee Pot Heritage Rail Experience day trip from Quorn to Woolshed Flat and return.

Pichi Richi Railway offers other special services including the occasional &quot;double header&quot; steam trains and the trains and carriages are available for private hire, suiting a range of different occasions from weddings to tour groups.

==Major projects==
The PRRPS has completed a number of major projects since its inception in 1973. These include return to service of steam locomotives and heritage rolling stock, rebuilding large sections of railway line and permanent way and the restoration of historic buildings.

===Rebuild of steam locomotive NM25===
Former Commonwealth Railways steam locomotive NM25 was built in 1925 and was used on the narrow gauge train line between Port Augusta and Alice Springs. It is one of only two surviving examples of this class of steam locomotive. NM25 had remained static from 1965 until 1989, when PRRPS acquired it with the intention of restoring it to operational condition. An overhaul commenced in 2000. The locomotive was recommissioned on 26 April 2003.

===Track extension to Port Augusta===
====History of the project====

During the Commonwealth Railways era (from 1937 to 1957), the train line between Stirling North and Port Augusta was dual gauge. Narrow gauge served the line to Quorn and the standard gauge, which branched at Stirling North, was for the line to Port Pirie and also to Marree. A new standard gauge line to Marree was built in the 1950s on a new route west of the Pichi Richi Pass, with the purpose of bypassing the narrow gauge section of the Central Australia Railway to Marree, through Quorn and Hawker. The narrow gauge component of the section dual gauge track between Stirling North and Port Augusta was removed once the standard gauge line to Marree was in full operation, and the narrow gauge route from Hawker to Marree had been closed and removed. This meant that the remaining narrow gauge line from Stirling North to Hawker via Quorn was now isolated. On the occasions that a narrow gauge train needed to travel to Port Augusta or to Marree, the train would need to utilise a piggy back system. This arrangement saw the entire narrow gauge train loaded on top of a standard gauge train of flatcars and transported via standard gauge, then unloaded at the destination on to the existing narrow gauge.

The first stage of returning narrow gauge train services to Port Augusta was the completion of of track rehabilitation between Woolshed Flat and Stirling North. This work included the complete replacement of sleepers and rail, re-timbering of several bridges and the construction of a turning triangle at Stirling North. Part of the $1.35 million Pichi Richi Railway Development Plan project, it was completed in 1999. The extension was opened on 24 October 1999 by former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia Tim Fischer.

It was announced in 2000 that funding was available through the State Government of South Australia, and the Port Augusta City Council to extend the train line from Stirling North in to Port Augusta railway station. However, there were significant works required for to complete this project.

====Crossing the standard gauge====
Because the existing narrow gauge between Stirling North and Port Augusta had been removed many years earlier, the challenge for the PRRPS was to develop an effective means of reinstating the narrow gauge in to Port Augusta. The greatest aspect to this challenge was how to cross over what remained of the standard gauge line to Marree, which had since been truncated at Telford Cut coal mine near Leigh Creek with the opening of the newer standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980. This line to Leigh Creek was exclusively used for transporting coal from Leigh Creek to Northern Power Station, and branched off the main standard gauge network at Stirling North. Many options for crossing this line were investigated, including a draw bridge arrangement, diamond crossovers and an underpass. The final decision was an underpass, passing below the Leigh Creek coal train line, which greatly reduced the amount of safe working interfacing with the standard gauge line. Diagram.

====Project completion====
The remainder of the narrow gauge line was constructed parallel to the standard gauge, ending at platform 2 of Port Augusta station. The South Australian Government donated rail for the project, which the Society lifted and transported from the abandoned Cambrai to Apamurra railway line in South Australia&#x27;s Murray Mallee region. For Pichi Richi Railway operations originating at the station, a two-road locomotive and carriage storage shed and a run-around track were constructed, and an turntable donated by Australian Southern Railroad, relocated from Kapunda, was installed to turn steam locomotives and tenders.

====Other route extension works====
Other works included:
*earthworks requiring the excavation and placement of approximately of material
*dismantling, transporting and relaying of 1300 lengths of long rail totalling 
*constructing six turnouts at Port Augusta to provide a run-around loop and access to the storage shed and turntable
*laying about 11,500 redgum and steel sleepers
*using 30,000 second-hand dogspikes, 10,000 screwspikes and 5,200 fishbolts
*transporting, distributing and tamping of track ballast
*designing, manufacturing, transporting and installing 13 large precast concrete culvert crowns and base sections for the underpass – achieved in 60 hours to avoid disrupting coal trains from Leigh Creek
*installing about 1600 pieces of pin-crib walling to the underpass at Stirling North.

The extension was officially opened 15 September 2001 by the local state MP, Graham Gunn, the then state Tourism Minister Joan Hall, and Port Augusta Mayor Joy Baluch.

Pichi Richi Railway has received many significant awards, including the following:

==Visiting operators==
PRRPS has hosted vehicles of other heritage railway operators.

The first occasion, in October 1981, was when the Steamtown Peterborough Railway Preservation Society ran a train to Quorn. Although the Quorn station yard and line to Peterborough was still under the control of Australian National at this time, the Steamtown trip became the last steam-hauled train and last passenger train to travel the entire Peterborough–Quorn railway line. Steamtown&#x27;s ex-WAGR Pmr720 was the only Pacific type steam locomotive to ever visit Quorn.

The Australian Society of Section Car Operators negotiated an access agreement with PRRPS and subsequently its members used the railway between Quorn and Stirling North to operate their section cars on the weekend of 22 and 23 March 2003.

Former BHAS locomotive &quot;Peronne&quot; and Short Tom carriage 144 from the National Railway Museum have operated on Pichi Richi Railway.

<text>The  () was a monopoly contract between the Spanish Crown and various merchants for the right to provide enslaved Africans to colonies in the Spanish Americas. The Spanish Empire rarely engaged in the transatlantic slave trade directly from Africa itself, choosing instead to contract out the importation to foreign merchants from nations more prominent in that part of the world, typically Portuguese and Genoese, but later the Dutch, French, and British. The Asiento did not concern French or British Caribbean, or Brazil, but only Spanish America.

The 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovas divided the Atlantic Ocean and other parts of the globe into two zones of influence, Spanish and Portuguese. The Spanish acquired the west side, washing South America and the West Indies, whilst the Portuguese obtained the east side, washing the west coast of Africa – and also the Indian Ocean beyond. The Spanish relied on enslaved African labourers to support their American colonial project, but now lacked any trading or territorial foothold in West Africa, the principal source of slave labour. The Spanish relied on Portuguese slave traders to fill their requirements. The contract was usually obtained by foreign merchant banks that cooperated with local or foreign traders, that specialized in shipping. Different organisations and individuals would bid for the right to hold the . 

The original impetus to import enslaved Africans was to relieve the indigenous inhabitants of the colonies from the labour demands of Spanish colonists. The enslavement of Amerindians had been halted by the influence of Dominicans such as Bartolomé de las Casas. Spain gave individual to Portuguese merchants to bring African slaves to South America. 

After the Peace of Münster, in 1648, Dutch merchants became involved in the Asiento de Negros. In 1713, the British were awarded the right to the asiento in the Treaty of Utrecht, which ended the War of the Spanish Succession. The British government passed its rights to the South Sea Company. The British ended with the 1750 Treaty of Madrid between Great Britain and Spain after the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, known appropriately by the Spanish as the &quot;Guerra del Asiento&quot; (&quot;War of the Asiento&quot;).
An , in the Spanish language, is a short-term loan or debt contract, of about one to four years, signed between the Spanish crown and a banker or a small group of bankers () against future crown revenues, often included after peace treaties were signed. An covered one or a combination of three specific transactions: an unsecured short-term loan, a transfer of payment, and a currency exchange contract. Between the early 16th and the mid-18th century, were used by the Spanish treasurer to adjust short-term imbalances between revenues and expenditures. The sovereign promised to repay the principal of the loan plus high interest (12%). The participant bankers in Seville, Lisbon, Republic of Genoa and Amsterdam, in turn, drew on the profits and direct investments obtained from a large number of Atlantic merchants. In exchange for a set of scheduled payments, merchants and financiers were given the right to collect relevant taxes or oversee the trade in those commodities that fell under the monarch&#x27;s prerogative. In this way a set of merchants received the right to ship tobacco, salt, sugar and cacao on a trade route from the Spanish West Indies, some times accompanied by licences to export bullion from Spanish Main or Cadiz. In particular, the would result in great impact for the economy of Spanish American colonies, because the treaty secured or would secure fixed revenues for the crown and the supply of the region with certain commodities, whereas the contracting party bore the risk of the trade. A new asiento was the safest means to get their money back and cash their arrears.

==History of the ==


===Background in the Spanish Americas===
The general meaning of (from the Spanish verb , to sit, which was derived from the Latin ) in Spanish is &quot;consent&quot; or &quot;settlement, establishment&quot;. In a commercial context, it means &quot;contract, trading agreement&quot;. In the words of Georges Scelle, it was &quot;a term in Spanish public law which designates every contract made for the purpose of public utility...between the Spanish government and private individuals.&quot;

The Asiento system was established following Spanish settlement in the Caribbean when the indigenous population was undergoing demographic collapse and the Spanish needed another source of labour. Initially, a few Christian Africans born in Iberia were transported to the Caribbean. But as the indigenous demographic collapse was ongoing and opponents of the Spanish exploitation of indigenous labour grew, including that of Bartolomé de Las Casas (although rescinding his views later), the young Habsburg king Charles I of Spain allowed for the direct importation of slaves from Africa (&quot;bozales&quot;) to the Caribbean. The first asiento for selling slaves was drawn up in August 1518, granting a Flemish favourite of Charles, Laurent de Gouvenot, a monopoly on importing enslaved Africans for eight years with a maximum of 4,000. Gouvenot promptly sold his licence to the treasurer of the and three subcontractors, Genoese merchants in Andalusia, for 25,000 ducats. The Casa de Contratación in Seville controlled both trade and immigration to the New World, excluding Jews, &quot;conversos&quot;, Muslims, and foreigners. African slaves were considered merchandise, and their imports were regulated by the crown. The Spanish crown collected a duty on each &quot;pieza&quot;, and not on each individual slave delivered. Spain had neither direct access to the African sources of slaves nor the ability to transport them, so the asiento system was a way to ensure a legal supply of Africans to the New World, which brought revenue to the Spanish crown. 

===Portuguese monopoly===
For the Spanish crown, the asiento was a source of profit. Haring says, &quot;The asiento remained the settled policy of the Spanish government for controlling and profiting from the slave trade.&quot; In Habsburg Spain, asientos were a basic method of financing state expenditures: &quot;Borrowing took two forms – long-term debt in the form of perpetual bonds (&quot;juros&quot;), and short-term loan contracts provided by bankers (&quot;asientos&quot;). Many asientos were eventually converted or refinanced through &quot;juros&quot;.&quot; 
Initially, since Portugal had unimpeded rights in West Africa via its 1494 treaty, it dominated the European slave trade of Africans. Before the onset of the official asiento in 1595, when the Spanish monarch also ruled Portugal in the Iberian Union (1580–1640), the Spanish fiscal authorities gave individual asientos to merchants, primarily from Portugal, to bring slaves to the Americas. For the 1560s most of these slaves were obtained in the Upper Guinea area, especially in the Sierra Leone region where there were many wars associated with the Mandé invasions.

Following the establishment of the Portuguese colony of Angola in 1575, and the gradual replacement of São Tomé by Brazil as the primary producer of sugar, Angolan interests came to dominate the trade, and it was Portuguese financiers and merchants who obtained the larger-scale, comprehensive asiento that was established in 1595 during the period of the Iberian Union. The asiento was extended to the importation of African slaves to Brazil, with those holding asientos for the Brazilian slave trade often also trading slaves in Spanish America. Spanish America was a major market for African slaves, including many of whom exceeded the quota of the asiento license and were illegally sold. From the period between 1595 and 1622, approximately half of all imported slaves were destined for Mexico. Most smuggled slaves were not brought by freelance traders.

Angolan dominance of the trade was pronounced after 1615 when the governors of Angola, starting with Bento Banha Cardoso, allied with Imbangala mercenaries to wreak havoc on the local African powers. Many of these governors also held the contract of Angola as well as the asiento, thus insuring their interests. Shipping registers from Vera Cruz and Cartagena show that as many as 85% of the slaves arriving in Spanish ports were from Angola, brought by Portuguese ships. In 1637 the Dutch West India Company employed Portuguese merchants in the trade. The earlier asiento period came to an end in 1640 when Portugal revolted against Spain, though even then the Portuguese continued to supply Spanish colonies.

===Dutch, French and British competition===
In 1647, the Dutch reached a provisional peace agreement with Spain, recognizing the status quo in the East and West Indies, as well as the patents of the Dutch East India and the West India Company. In the 1650s after Portugal achieved its independence from Spain, Spain denied the asiento to the Portuguese, whom it considered rebels. Spain sought to enter the slave trade directly, sending ships to Angola to purchase slaves. It also toyed with the idea of a military alliance with Kongo, the powerful African kingdom north of Angola. But these ideas were abandoned and the Spanish returned to Portuguese and then Dutch interests to supply slaves. (Captain Holmes&#x27;s expedition captured or destroyed all the Dutch settlements on Ghana&#x27;s coast.) The Spanish awarded large contracts for the asiento to the Genovese banker Grillo in the 1660s and the Dutch West India Company in 1675 rather than Portuguese merchants in the 1670s and 1680s. However, this same period saw a resurgence of piracy. In 1700, with the death of the last Habsburg monarch, Charles II of Spain, his will named the House of Bourbon in the form of Philip V of Spain as the successor to the Spanish throne. The Bourbon family were also Kings of France and so the asiento was granted in 1702 to the French Guinea Company, for the importation of 48,000 African slaves over a decade. The Africans were transported to the French Caribbean colonies of Martinique and Saint Domingue.

As part of their strategy of maintaining a balance of power in Europe, Great Britain and her allies, including the Dutch and the Portuguese, disputed the Bourbon inheritance of the Spanish throne and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession against Bourbon hegemony. Although Britain did not prevail, it did receive the &quot;asiento&quot; as part of the Peace of Utrecht. This granted Britain a thirty-year &quot;asiento&quot; to send one merchant ship to the Spanish port of Portobelo, furnishing 4800 slaves to the Spanish colonies. The &quot;asiento&quot; became a conduit for British contraband and smugglers of all kinds, which undermined Spain&#x27;s attempts to keep a protectionist trading system with its American colonies. Disputes connected with it led to the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (1739). Britain gave up its rights to the asiento after the war, in the Treaty of Madrid of 1750, as Spain was implementing several administrative and economic reforms. The Spanish Crown bought out the South Sea Company&#x27;s right to the &quot;asiento&quot; that year. The Spanish Crown sought another way to supply African slaves, attempting to liberalize its traffic, trying to shift to a system of the free trade in slaves by Spaniards and foreigners in particular colonial locations. These were Cuba, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico, and Caracas, all of which used African slaves in large numbers.

== Holders of the &quot;Asiento&quot; ==

===Early: 1518–1595===
* 1518–1527: Laurent de Gouvenot (aka Lorenzo de Gorrevod or Garrebod), ex-Governor of Bresse and Mayordomo mayor of Charles I of Spain. The first known transatlantic slave ship—sailed from São Tomé in 1525.
** to Domingo de Forne, Agustín de Ribaldo and Fernando Vázquez, all Genoese established in Seville.
* 1528–1536: The Welser and Fugger families from Augsburg. The Welser family is granted with the Asiento in Venezuela Province but dispossessed of the Asiento following complaints about their treatment of Native American workers.
* 1565: King Philip II grants Pedro Menéndez de Avilés an asiento with expansive trade privileges, the power to distribute lands, and licenses to sell 500 slaves, as well as various titles, including that of &quot;adelantado&quot; of Florida.

===Portuguese: 1595–1640===
Six Asientos were granted to:
* 30 January 1595 – 13 May 1601: Pedro Gomes Reynel 
* 13 May 1601 – 16 October 1604: João Rodrigues Coutinho.
* 16 October 1604 – 27 September 1615: Gonçalo Vaz Coutinho
* 27 September 1615 – 1 April 1623: António Fernandes de Elvas. The two main places in the Spanish Americas that slaves were brought were Cartagena de Indias (in modern Colombia) and Veracruz (in modern Mexico) from here they were distributed out towards what is today Venezuela, the Antilles and Lima (through Portobello and Panama) then to Upper Peru and Potosí. 
* 1 April 1623 – 25 September 1631: Manuel Rodrigues Lamego; 59 ships were licensed for Africa, where around 8,000 African slaves were purchased from West African merchants, mostly from Luanda. 
* 25 September 1631 – 1 December 1640: Melchor Gómez Angel and Cristóvão Mendes de Sousa.

In 1640 the Iberian Union fell apart; the Portuguese Restoration War began. Between 1640 and 1651 there was no asiento. ) Slave arrivals to the Spanish Americas declined precipitously. On 12 July 1641 Portugal and the Dutch Republic signed a &#x27;Treaty of Offensive and Defensive Alliance&#x27;, otherwise known as the Treaty of The Hague. Dutch ships were allowed in any Portuguese port for ten years. Dutch merchant Jan Valckenburgh saw an opportunity but was expelled from Loango-Angola in 1648. Dutch private entrepreneurs were responsible for almost half of the total investment in slave trade against a smaller share held by the WIC.

The Invasion of Jamaica was the &quot;casus belli&quot; that resulted in the actual Anglo-Spanish War (1654-1660). In March 1659 the Danish Africa Company was started by the Finnish Hendrik Carloff and two Dutchmen. Their mandate included trade with the Danish Gold Coast. Their goal was to compete with the Dutch, the Swedish Africa Company and the Portuguese. The Dutch competed with the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa founded in 1660. Both of these slaving powers had a strong presence on the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin; many slaves came from Cross River (Nigeria), Calabar in the Bight of Biafra and West Central Africa. The Dutch and Portuguese signed a new Treaty of The Hague (1661). Matthias Beck, who had left Dutch Brazil in 1654, was appointed by the WIC as governor of Curaçao, that, from 1662 to 1728 and intermittently thereafter, functioned as an entrepôt through which captives on Dutch transatlantic ships reached Spanish colonies. A second branch of the intra-American slave traffic originated in Barbados and the Colony of Jamaica.

===Genoese: 1662–1671===
In 1658 Ambrogio Lomellini and Domenico Grillo were appointed as &quot;Treasurers of the Holy Crusade&quot;, waging war against &quot;infidels&quot;. This fact allowed them to have access to a part of the treasures that came from America. (From the late 1640s Grillo and his business partner Lomellini lived in Madrid.) In 1662 and 1666 Spain (or the royal finances) were bankrupt. Slave-contracts of the WIC with Grillo and Lomellini of Madrid, 1662 and 1667, who were permitted to sub-contract to any nation friendly to Spain.
* July 5, 1662 – 1669: Grillo and Lomellini promised to ship 24,000 slaves in seven years, assisted by the Dutch West India Company and the English Royal Adventurers from Jamaica to Cartagena, Colombia, Veracruz in Mexico and Portobello in Panama. In 1664, the political situation in Europe and the Caribbean was volatile, leading to Second Anglo-Dutch War. Robert Holmes captured the Dutch trading post of Cabo Verde in June 1664 and confiscated several ships of the Dutch West India company. The Duke of York, governor of the Royal Africa Company, envied the Dutch trade in slaves to Spanish America. 
* Cristóbal Calderón, the attorney general or &quot;procurador&quot; of Havana, requests, on behalf of his city, a license to sail directly to the coasts of Guinea and Angola to supply themselves in slaves instead of relying on those the Asiento brought in from Barbados and Curaçao. Havana, April 28, 1664.
* In January 1667, Grillo and Lomelin convinced the Council of the Indies to return 100,000 pesos to the Asiento to restore the slaving negotiations with the British and the Dutch. 
* Grillo and Lomellini contacted :nl:Francesco Ferroni in Amsterdam and then turned to the Dutch to fulfil the conditions of their contract. Grillo&#x27;s monopoly was bitterly received in the colonies. He operated almost exclusively by proxy. In 1668 when Grillo&#x27;s estate was threatened with confiscation because of enormous debts, he succeeded in an extension of the Asiento for two years. 
* In 1668 an immense warehouse was erected on baren island of Curaçao. About 90% of the slaves were exported from Curaçao and half of them illegally. 
** In 1669 Spain is almost bankrupt. The Coymans bank in Amsterdam transported on four warships Spanish dollars or bars of silver (worth 500,000 guilders) from New Spain to Cadiz in order to get a subcontract. Also King Charles II of England tried to acquire the asiento. 
** The Treaty of Madrid (1670) was highly favourable to England, as its ownership of territories in the Caribbean Sea was confirmed by Spain. England agreed to suppress piracy in the Caribbean and in return Spain agreed to permit English ships freedom of movement. Both agreed to refrain from trading in the other&#x27;s Caribbean territory and to limit trading to their possessions.
* In 1671 the Grillo asiento is ended because of mistrust. Grillo&#x27;s experience opened up the way for expansion of the Dutch, English and French slave trading companies. 
** In 1671, the privateer Henry Morgan, licensed by the English government, sacked and burned the city of Panamá Viejo an important port on the Pacific used by Grillo for slave trade along the coast.
** In 1672 the Royal Africa Company was founded, headed by the Duke of York.
** In 1673 the Compagnie du Sénégal was founded and used Gorée to house the slaves since 1677. According to historical accounts, no more than 500 slaves per year were traded there.
** 1674: The French West India Company went bankrupt; the Dutch lost New Amsterdam and New Netherlands in the Third Anglo-Dutch War.
** 1675: The Dutch New West India Company restarted; Curaçao seems to have become a free port for sugar, slaves and contraband.

===Dutch &amp; Portuguese: 1671–1701===
In 1661 the Dutch and the Portuguese signed a peace. The beginning of the slave trade on Curaçao is in 1665. In 1666 France and Denmark declared war on England. After the Second Anglo-Dutch War the Dutch and the English signed the Treaty of Breda and New York became British. The Treaty of Lisbon (1668) ended the war between Spain and Portugal. In 1674, the WIC made Curaçao a free port, giving it a key position in the international networks, especially the slave trade.
* 1671–1674: António Garcia, a Portuguese, was the heir of Lomelino. In 1675 he looked for assistance from Balthasar and his brother Joseph Coymans and the Dutch West India Company, financing the loan and the shipping. Garcia arranged to purchase all the slaves in Curaçao. 
* 1676–1679: Manuel Hierro de Castro, and Manuel José Cortizos, members of the Consulado de Sevilla. The Spanish proposed to get the slaves from Cape Verde, located on the demarcation line between the Spanish and Portuguese empire, but this was against the WIC-charter. The Dutch offered to bring the slaves to Hispaniola or the ports on the Spanish Main. From 1662 to 1690, only twenty slaving vessels set out under the Spanish flag, mostly between 1677 and 1681, an average of less than one a year.
* In May 1679 the Coymans financed slave transports, organized by Captain Juan Barroso del Pozo, of 9,800 &quot;negros&quot; to Curaçao. 
* In 1680, Barroso from Seville and Nicolás Porcio, his Venetian son-in-law, became &quot;asentistas&quot;.
* 1682–1688: Juan Barroso del Pozo (−1683) and Nicolás Porcio succeeded in getting the asiento for 6.5 years. It was Porcio who encountered many financial difficulties after the loss of ships and slaves. In 1683 he travelled to Portobelo but was taken, prisoner. He was unable to make his payments to the crown, alleging that the local authorities in Cartagena were working against his interests.
** 1683 Dutch privateers attacked Veracruz and Cartagena.
** In 1684 Genoa was heavily bombarded by a French fleet as punishment for its alliance with Spain. As a result, the Genoese bankers and traders made new economic and financial links with Louis XIV.
* February 1685 – March 1687: Balthasar Coymans succeeded in ousting Porcio. The cash payment to the Spanish government, an indispensable feature of this bargain, was furnished by the Amsterdam house of Coymans. Coymans made an immediate payment towards some frigates for the Spanish navy being built in Amsterdam and an advance on the dues he would be liable for on goods imported to Spanish America.
** Royal Order, signed &quot;El Rey&quot;, commanding Don Balthasar Coymans, Don Juan Barrosa and Don Nicolás Porzio to assemble ten Capuchin monks (Franciscan friars) from either Cadiz or Amsterdam to sail to the coast of Africa to buy slaves, to convert them to Christianity and sell them in the West Indies, 25 March 1685 Balthasar &amp; Johan Coymans.
** &quot;Carta de Rodrigo Gómez a [Manuel Diego López de Zúñiga Mendoza Sotomayor, X] Duque de Béjar informando de la concesión de un asiento de negros en el Río de la Plata a favor de Baltasar Coymans y pide recomendaciones personales para que su hijo Pedro sea empleado en ese negocio. Menciona también a Gaspar de Rebolledo, Juan Pimentel como Gobernador de Buenos Aires y a [Carlos José Gutiérrez de los Ríos Roha, VI] Conde de Fernán-Núñez&quot;. Antwerp, 1685-04-17.
** July 1686: The Imperial Cortes, Council of Castile started an investigation into the legitimacy of the Asiento. The asiento with Coymans is annulled.
** October 1686: The Dutch refused to accept the &quot;Junta de Asiento de Negros&quot;, a commission of dubious authority.
** There was a risk of war between France, Britain and Spain, resulting in the Grand Alliance; the Dutch feared Jamaica was becoming more important than Curaçao.
** The Dutch West India Company paid high dividends, 10%.
* 1687–1688: Jan Carçau, or Juan Carcán a former assistant of Balthasar Coymans, takes over the asiento.
** March 1688: Jan Carçao is put in prison in Cádiz, accused of fraud. In June 1688 the commission delivered an opinion the Dutch must recognize the Juntas authority before discussions could proceed. 
** In August 1688 the shares of the Dutch East and West India company collapsed in a crash on the Amsterdam stock market. Since the Glorious Revolution the catholic oriented James II of England exiled in France.
* 1688 – October 1691: Nicolás Porcio. 
* 1692–1695: Bernardo Francisco Marín de Guzmán.
** 1695–1701: Spain returned to the Portuguese; Manuel Ferreira de Carvalho representing the Cacheu and Cape Verde Company. 
** By 1695, the French Navy had declined to the point that it could no longer face the English and Dutch in an open sea battle and therefore had switched to privateering – Guerre de course.
** 1695–1696 The Royal Africa Company suffered heavy losses, and lost its monopoly after the Trade with Africa Act 1697.
** By 1696, it was clear Charles II of Spain would die childless, and his potential heirs included Louis XIV and Emperor Leopold in Vienna. 
** May 1697 the French raided Cartagena and plundered the city. Jean du Casse, who gave his support only reluctantly, as he preferred an attack on Portobelo, where most of the silver and Spanish dollars came from. All the countries needed to boost the economy at the end of the Nine Years War. In September 1697, France signed Treaties of Peace with Spain and England, and a Treaty of Peace and Commerce with the Dutch Republic (Peace of Ryswick). In the Caribbean, France received the Spanish islands of Tortuga and Saint-Domingue.
* 1699–1703 Manuel Belmonte cooperated with Luis and Simon Rodriques de Souza from the Portuguese West India Company. 
** In 1700 a grandson of Louis XIV ascended the Spanish throne as King Philip V of Spain. 
** In 1702 the War of the Spanish Succession began: the Grand Alliance (Kingdom of England, Dutch Republic and Holy Roman Empire) declared war on France and Spain. However, the Royal Navy&#x27;s main effort was not off the Spanish Main, but off the Spanish coasts in Europe (Battle of Cádiz). Spanish naval losses in the Battle of Vigo Bay meant a total dependence on the French navy to keep up communications with the Americas. Spain was reliant on French ships, not only for slaves, even for its bullion fleet. Because of commercial competition paying the French and Spanish for the Asiento was a prominent issue during the Spanish War of Succession.
** The Methuen Treaty with the Dutch envoy Francesco Belmonte as one of the negotiators regulated the establishment of trade relations between England, Portugal and perhaps Brazil? The Portuguese who had trouble letting go of their Asiento rights ... were understood as a French privilege and indeed a marker of the superior status of the French abroad.

===French: 1701–1713===
*1701–1713: Governor Jean-Baptiste du Casse in name of the Compagnie de Guinée et de l&#x27;Assiente des Royaume de la France, founded in 1684. Company of Guinée concentrated on the slave trade for Guinée and Saint-Domingue; returning with sugar and all the other goods to Nantes. In 1701, the French king granted the Guinée Company the Spanish Asiento and the company reorganised. Unlike any other chartered company before it, it included both the Spanish king and the French king as shareholders, for one-quarter of the total capital each, which amounted to 100,000 livres. The Asiento did not concern French Caribbean but Spanish America. 
* In 1706, the English planters on Jamaica asked the Guinée company to supply them with slaves, but it was refused.
* December 2, 1711, Jacques Cassard obtained from the French king the command of a squadron of eight vessels and embarked on an expedition during which he plundered the Portuguese colony Cape Verde. He seized in particular fort Praia on Santiago, Cape Verde, the storehouse of the commerce. Then he set off to Montserrat and Antigua in the Caribbean before heading to the possessions of the Dutch. On 10 October 1712, Cassard attacked Suriname and Berbice, where demanded an amount of 300,000 guilders, which was paid in bills of exchange, slaves and goods. The negotiations with Suriname started, and on 27 October Cassard left with ƒ 747,350 (€8.1 million in 2018). Cassard returned to Martinique and set sail towards Sint Eustatius. Curaçao was occupied by Cassard from February 18 to 27, 1713, more substantial and richer than the previous ones, but it&#x27;s also much better defended.
* The king abolished the Asiento Company&#x27;s monopoly in 1713 and opened the trade south of the Sierra Leone River to French private traders from five specific port towns: Nantes, Bordeaux, La Rochelle, Le Havre and Saint-Malo. They paid a tax to the king for each enslaved African transported to the French West Indies upon their return to France.

===British: 1713–1750===

After the introduction of the Trade with Africa Act 1697 the Royal African Company lost its monopoly and in 1708 it was insolvent.
*1 May 1713 – May 1743: South Sea Company received the Asiento for thirty years, The English contractor was required to advance 200,000 pesos (£45,000) to Philip for their share in the trade, to be paid in two equal installments, the first two months after the contract was signed, the second two months after the first. In addition, the company was allowed to send one ship of 500 tons annually to Portobello to engage in normal trade to avoid contraband.

The 1713 Peace of Utrecht granted Britain an &quot;asiento de negros&quot; lasting 30 years to supply the Spanish colonies with 144,000 at 4,800 slaves per year. Britain was permitted to open offices in Buenos Aires, Caracas, Cartagena, Havana, Panama, Portobello and Vera Cruz. An extra-legal clause was added; one ship of no more than 500 tons could be sent to one of these places each year (the &quot;Navío de Permiso&quot;) with general trade goods. (Two ships were in addition to the annual ships, but were not part of the asiento contract.) One-quarter of the profits were to be reserved for the King of Spain. The Asiento was granted in the name of Queen Anne and then contracted to the company.

It was provided that the same reporting procedure might take place at subsequent five-year intervals. At the end of the contract the Assentistas were permitted three years to remove their effects from the Indies, adjust their accounts and ‘‘make up a balance of the whole”.

By July the South Sea Company had arranged contracts with the Royal African Company to supply the necessary African slaves to Jamaica. Ten pounds was paid for a slave aged over 16, £8 for one under 16 but over 10. Two-thirds were to be male, and 90% adult. The company trans-shipped 1,230 slaves from Jamaica to America in the first year, plus any that might have been added (against standing instructions) by the ship&#x27;s captains on their own behalf. On arrival of the first cargoes, the local authorities refused to accept the &quot;asiento&quot;, which had still not been officially confirmed there by the Spanish authorities. The slaves were eventually sold at a loss in the West Indies.

In 1714 the government announced that a quarter of profits would be reserved for Queen Anne and a further 7.5% for a financial advisor, Manuel Manasses Gilligan, an English colonist, who operated from the (neutral) Danish West Indies. Some Company board members refused to accept the contract on these terms, and the government was obliged to reverse its decision. Despite these setbacks, the company continued, having raised 200,000 pesos (maybe ducats or Spanish escudos? to finance the operations. Anne had secretly negotiated with France to get its approval regarding the &quot;asiento.&quot; She boasted to Parliament of her success in taking the &quot;asiento&quot; away from France and London celebrated her economic coup.

In 1714 2,680 slaves were carried, and for 1716–17, 13,000 more, but the trade continued to be unprofitable. As the French previously discovered, high costs meant the real profits from the slave trade asiento were in smuggling contraband goods, which evaded import duties and deprived the authorities of much-needed revenue. An import duty of 33 pieces of eight was charged on each slave (although for this purpose two children were counted as one adult slave). In 1718 a declaration of war between England and Spain halted operations under the Asiento until 1721. The company&#x27;s assets in South America were seized, at a cost claimed by the company to be £300,000. Any prospect of profit from trade, for which the company had purchased ships and had been planning its next ventures, disappeared. Similar conflicts interrupted the contract from 1727 to 1729 and 1739 to 1748. Increasing knowledge of illicit trading by the SSC resulted in the Spanish tightening on-site monitoring in the Americas during the 1730s. The Spanish then proceeded to seek recompense for clandestine trade carried on by the SSC and others under the veil of the supply of Negroes and the annual ship. Thus a key feature of the depredations crisis was the ongoing failure by the SSC to account and report transparently. Spain having raised objections to the &quot;asiento&quot; clauses, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was supplemented by the Treaty of Madrid (5 October 1750). The matter of the &quot;asiento&quot; was not even mentioned in the treaty, as it had lessened in importance to both nations, although both parties had agreed to resolve outstanding concerns at a &quot;proper time and place&quot;. The issue was finally settled in 1750 when Britain agreed to renounce its claim to the asiento in exchange for a payment of £100,000 and British trade with Spanish America under favourable conditions. In 1752 the African Company of Merchants was founded.

It has been estimated that the company transported over 34,000 slaves with deaths comparable to its competitors, which was taken as competence in this area of work at the time. Meanwhile, it became a business for privately owned enterprises; the Dutch West India Company began to outsource the slave trade since 1730s? In 1740 a Havana company paid Spain for the Asiento to import slaves to Cuba.
* There was no &quot;asiento&quot; during the Austrian War of Succession (1740–1748). 
*1748–1750: Spain renewed the &quot;asiento&quot; with Britain for four years, but it ended with the Treaty of Madrid. The Spanish authorities &quot;restore[d] the slave trade to the sphere of internal law from which it should never have left&quot;. By the middle of the 18th century, British Jamaica and French Saint-Domingue had become the largest slave societies of the region. As of 1778, the French were importing approximately 13,000 Africans for enslavement to the French West Indies each year.
* In 1762, the British imported more than 10,000 African slaves to Havana. They used it as a base to supply the Caribbean and the lower Thirteen Colonies. In response to the short British occupation of Havana (1762–1763), when the British disembarked 3,500 slaves in ten months, the Spanish crown made determined efforts to revive its own transatlantic slave-trading role. Spain theoretically allowed no foreigners to share directly in the colonial trade, the effect of which was to starve the colonies of necessary imports and to encourage smuggling.

===Spanish: 1765–1779===
The asiento was given to a group of Basques from 1765 to 1779.

*1765–1772: Miguel de Uriarte in name of Aguirre, Aristegui, J.M. Enrile y Compañía, or &quot;Compañía Gaditana&quot;.
*1773–1779: Aguirre, Aristegui y Compañía, or &quot;Compañía Gaditana&quot;.
*A severe credit crisis in 1772 forced the Cliffords and several other bankers and their firms, going bankrupt. In 1773 many planters in Surinam and the Caribbean came into financial trouble and the Dutch slave trade dropped.
* A significant moral victory was achieved when the British Chief Justice, Lord Mansfield, ruled in 1772 that slavery was illegal in Britain (Somersett&#x27;s Case), thereby freeing about 15,000 slaves who had accompanied their masters there—and abruptly terminating the practice of black slaves ostentatiously escorting their masters about the kingdom. 
* During the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War the English seized a few Dutch slave ships, such as the Zong. An attempt to capture the Dutch castle at Elmina on Africa&#x27;s Gold Coast (modern Ghana) failed in 1782. While many Dutch territories in the West Indies were taken by the British, some, like Curaçao, were not attacked due to their defensive strength.
*In 1784, the Spanish crown contracted with the large Liverpool firm to bring slaves to Venezuela and Cuba between 1786 and 1789. 
*On the 4th of February 1794 a decree is passed by the National Legislative Assembly, making France the first European country to officially outlaw slavery in all its colonies. However this was only implemented in Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe and Guiana. 
*In March 1795 the Batavian Republic did not accept all citizens on equal footing (bookkeeping); 
*The Law of 20 May 1802 reinstates slavery in the French Empire.
Spain&#x27;s connection to the slave trade with Africa was minor, smaller than that of the Portuguese, the English, the French and Dutch, estimated at only 185 voyages and 276,885 slaves who embarked from 1500 to 1800. This compares to almost 25,000 voyages and over 7,331,831 slaves who disembarked in total by those nations from 1500 to 1800. Of the total number of slaves, nearly half went to the Caribbean islands and the Guianas, almost 40 per cent to Brazil, and some 6 per cent to mainland Spanish America. Most of them arrived between 1601 and 1625, but the number dropped to its lowest between 1676 and 1700. Surprisingly enough, under 5 per cent of the slaves went to North America. These figures may change as authors of &quot;Atlantic History and the Slave Trade to Spanish America&quot; suggest half of them went to Brazil and a quarter to the Caribbean.

The Spanish privateer and merchant Amaro Pargo (1678-1747) managed to transport slaves to the Caribbean, although, it is estimated, to a lesser extent than other captains and figures of the time dedicated to this activity. In 1710, the privateer was involved in a complaint by the priest Alonso García Ximénez, who accused him of freeing an African slave named Sebastián, who was transported to Venezuela on one of Amaro&#x27;s ships. The aforementioned Alonso García granted a power of attorney on July 18, 1715 to Teodoro Garcés de Salazar so that he could demand his return in Caracas. Despite this fact, Amaro Pargo himself also owned slaves in his domestic service.

<doc id="1130360" wikidata="Q311469" url="?curid=1130360" title="Mariana of Austria">
<text>Mariana or Maria Anna of Austria (24 December 1634 – 16 May 1696), was Queen of Spain from 1649 until the death of her husband Philip IV of Spain in 1665. Appointed regent for their infant son Charles II, she remained an influential figure until her death in 1696.

Her regency was overshadowed by Spain&#x27;s post-1648 decline and internal political divisions, combined with a general European economic crisis during the latter half of the 17th century. Her son&#x27;s failure to produce an heir ultimately ended in the 1701 to 1714 War of the Spanish Succession. 

==Birth and early years==
Maria Anna was born on 24 December 1634 in Wiener Neustadt, second child of Maria Anna of Spain and her husband Ferdinand (1608–1657), who became Holy Roman Emperor in 1637. Her parents had three children who survived into adulthood, Mariana and her two brothers, Ferdinand (1633–1654), and Leopold (1640–1705), elected emperor in 1658.

In 1646, Maria Anna was betrothed to her cousin Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias, heir to the Spanish throne. His death soon afterwards left her without a prospective husband and her widowed uncle Philip IV without a successor. On 7 October 1649, Philip married his 14-year-old niece Maria Anna in Navalcarnero, outside Madrid. 

Only two of their five children survived to adulthood. The eldest was Margaret Theresa, who married her maternal uncle Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1666. Mariana&#x27;s second daughter, Maria Ambrosia, lived only fifteen days, followed by two sons, Philip Prospero and Ferdinand Thomas. On 6 November 1661, Mariana gave birth to her last child, a son, Charles. 

It has been suggested Charles inherited several rare genetic disorders from his parents, but his elder sister did not experience the same issues, while the most significant study on this topic concludes such claims remain speculation. Regardless, Charles&#x27; death was expected almost from birth, leading to internal struggles between backers of his two potential co-heirs, Louis XIV and Emperor Leopold. &quot;Short, lame, epileptic, senile and completely bald before 35, ... [he] repeatedly baffled Christendom by continuing to live&quot;.

== Regency ==
===First regency: 1665–1677===
Charles was only three years old when Philip died on 17 September 1665, and Mariana was appointed regent, advised by a Regency Council, until he became a legal adult at the age of 14. She adopted the system established by Philip in 1620, the first being Juan Everardo Nithard, an Austrian Jesuit and her personal confessor; as Philip&#x27;s will excluded foreigners from the Regency Council, he had to be naturalised, causing immediate resentment. Other informal advisors included Gaspar de Bracamonte, 3rd Count of Peñaranda and Mariana Engracia Álvarez de Toledo Portugal y Alfonso-Pimentel.

Charles&#x27; poor health and lack of an heir meant his reign was often dominated by a power struggle between Mariana&#x27;s &quot;Austrian&quot; faction, and a pro-French lobby initially led by his illegitimate half-brother, John of Austria the Younger. Spain was also divided into the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, whose very different political cultures made it almost impossible to enact reforms or increase taxes. As a result, government finances were in perpetual crisis, the Crown declaring bankruptcy in 1647, 1652, 1661 and 1666. 

Spain was exhausted by almost a century of continuous war, while the second half of the 17th century coincided with a period of extreme cold weather known as the Little Ice Age. Between 1692 and 1699, crops failed across Europe and an estimated 5–10% of the population starved to death. The new government inherited other problems, the long-running Portuguese Restoration War being the most urgent. This was made worse in May 1667 when France once again invaded the Spanish Netherlands, and occupied the Spanish province of Franche-Comté. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668) ended the war with France, while the Treaty of Lisbon (1668) restored Portugal&#x27;s independence. 

Peace ended the drain on Spanish resources, while France returned most of the territories over-run in the War of Devolution. They represented a significant diplomatic achievement, but many Spanish military officers considered the terms humiliating. Joseph Malladas, an Aragonese captain, was executed in June 1668 for plotting to murder Nithard, reputedly on John&#x27;s behalf. In February 1669, Nithard was succeeded as by Aytona, who died in 1670 and replaced in turn by Valenzuela, a member of her household since 1661. An outsider from the lower ranks of Spanish nobility, Valenzuela depended entirely on Mariana for his position. 

In 1672, Spain was dragged into the Franco-Dutch War; Valenzuela was dismissed when Charles came of age in 1675, but Spanish policy continued to be undermined by the struggle for power. Mariana reinstated the regency in 1677 on the grounds of Charles&#x27;s ill-health and Valenzuela was restored, before John finally gained control in 1677.

===Second regency: 1679–1696===
John died in September 1679 and Mariana became regent once again; one of his final acts was arranging the marriage of Charles to 17-year-old Marie Louise of Orléans, which took place in November 1679. She died in February 1689, without producing an heir; as with many deaths of the period, limited medical knowledge led to allegations she was poisoned. Modern assessments of her symptoms conclude it was almost certainly appendicitis, possibly from the treatments undertaken to improve fertility.

Her replacement was Maria Anna of Neuburg, one of 12 children whose family reputation for fertility made them popular choices for royal marriages. Of her sisters, Maria Sophia married Peter II of Portugal, while Eleonore was the third wife of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. Maria Anna was aunt to future emperors Joseph I and Charles VI, making her an ideal choice for the Austrian faction. However, Charles was by now almost certainly impotent, his autopsy later revealing he had only one atrophied testicle. 

As his health declined, internal struggles over the succession became increasingly bitter, leadership of the pro-French faction passing to Fernández de Portocarrero, Archbishop of Toledo. In 1690, Spain joined the Grand Alliance in the Nine Years&#x27; War with France. It declared bankruptcy again in 1692 and by 1696, France occupied most of Catalonia; Mariana retained power with the support of German auxiliaries under Maria Anna&#x27;s brother Charles Philip, many of whom were expelled after Mariana&#x27;s death. She died on 16 May 1696 at the Uceda Palace in Madrid, at the age of sixty-one, probably from breast cancer.

==Legacy==
In 1668, Mariana approved the establishment of a Jesuit mission under Diego Luis de San Vitores and Saint Pedro Calungsod on a series of islands the Spanish referred to as the Ladrones, which were renamed the Mariana Islands in her honour.

The Portrait of Mariana of Austria painted by Diego Velázquez was commissioned by Philip and is the only known full-length painting of her. The original is in the Prado Museum in Madrid; a copy was sent to her father Ferdinand and is held by the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. She also appears as a detail in Velasquez&#x27; masterpiece Las Meninas which features her daughter Margaret Theresa.

==Issue==
By her marriage she had five children:
* Margaret Theresa of Austria, Infanta of Spain (12 July 1651 12 March 1673), married Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor
* Maria Ambrosia de la Concepción Enrichetta Theresa of Austria, Infanta of Spain (7 December 1655 21 December 1655)
* Philip Prospero of Austria, Infante of Spain, Prince of Asturias (28 November 1657 1 November 1661)
* Ferdinand Thomas Charles of Austria, Infante of Spain (23 December 1658 22 October 1659)
* Charles II of Spain (6 November 1661 1 November 1700) married Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, no issue. Married secondly Maria Anna of Neuburg, no issue.

<text>Running Wild is a German heavy metal band formed in Hamburg in 1976. They were part of the German metal scene to emerge in the early to mid-1980s, and are also considered to be one of the country&#x27;s so-called &quot;big four&quot; of power metal, along with Grave Digger, Helloween and Rage. Over the course of their career, they have released 17 studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, and six singles/EPs. 

Although their earlier releases contained Satanic themes and imagery, from the third album on, the band&#x27;s primary subject matter centered around pirates, sailing and other historical events. In 1987, the band released the album &quot;Under Jolly Roger,&quot; which was a switch to pirate-based and historical themes, creating and influencing the later named pirate metal subgenre of heavy metal in the 2000s in the process. While the historical lyrics were very superficial at first, the lyrics for later albums were intensively researched, by frontman Rolf Kasparek in particular.

After &quot;Under Jolly Roger&quot;, from 1988 to 1992 (for the albums &quot;Port Royal&quot;, &quot;Death or Glory&quot;, &quot;Blazon Stone&quot; and &quot;Pile of Skulls&quot;), Running Wild mainly wrote historically based lyrics. In addition to lyrics about pirates, the band also addressed subjects like the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of Waterloo, or the colonization of the New World by the Conquistadors.

In April 2009, Kasparek announced that Running Wild had split up. Their intended last show was at Wacken Open Air in July that year. It was recorded for CD and DVD release and appeared as &quot;The Final Jolly Roger&quot; in 2011. The split would prove temporary as they reunited in 2012. Running Wild played live for the Wacken Open Air festival in 2015. As of 2021, the band had released 17 studio albums, with their most recent being &quot;Blood on Blood&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early years and first albums ===
The band formed in 1976 under the name Granite Heart, but they would change their name in 1979 to Running Wild after the Judas Priest song of the same name. The band recorded their first demo in 1981 and featured the songs &quot;Hallow the Hell&quot;, &quot;War Child&quot; and &quot;King of the Midnight Fire&quot;. The first two of these tracks appeared on the compilation album &quot;Debüt №1&quot; on the Raubbau Label. In June 1984, the band started work on their debut album &quot;Gates to Purgatory&quot;, which was released by Noise Records, featuring satanic lyrics. The album proved to be a success, and the band quickly gained a cult following. Guitarist Gerald &quot;Preacher&quot; Warnecke left the band soon after the album&#x27;s release. (Gerald &quot;Preacher&quot; Warnecke was studying theology at the time and is now a pastor in Cologne.) The band soon recruited Majk Moti to take his place, and soon recorded their follow up &quot;Branded and Exiled&quot; in 1985. This album would prove to be the final release of the band with satanic imagery in their music.

=== Rise in popularity, success and later albums ===
For the following release, the band shifted their sound and image and adopted a pirate theme. The band released &quot;Under Jolly Roger&quot; in 1987. This would prove a significant change because the band would be more known as a &quot;pirate metal&quot; band, with lyrics dealing with pirates and historical events. With this album, the band found their identity, and the pirate theme would be prominent on their future releases. Their 1988 follow-up release &quot;Port Royal&quot; featured a more mature style of songwriting and expanded on the pirate theme explored on their previous album. The album featured one of the band&#x27;s first epics, Calico Jack. In 1989, the release of the band&#x27;s fifth studio recording &quot;Death or Glory&quot;, proved to be the band&#x27;s most successful album to date. The tour was also a success and a concert during the tour was filmed and was released as &quot;Death or Glory Tour&quot;. This album and tour would be the final release to feature guitarist Majk Moti and drummer Ian Finlay.

Upon the departure of Moti and Finlay, Kasparek recruited guitarist Axel Morgan and drummer Rudiger Dreffein (better known as &quot;AC&quot;) to record the band&#x27;s first album in two years, &quot;Blazon Stone&quot;, released in 1991. The album continued the band&#x27;s trend of writing about historical themes, and according to band leader, Rolf Kasparek, it was to be the band&#x27;s best-selling album of the 1990s. The album proved to be a slight shift in their overall sound, as the band brought a more speed metal approach to their songs, which would be prevalent throughout their releases during the decade. In 1992, the band began work on &quot;Pile of Skulls&quot; which was regarded by many as one of the band&#x27;s strongest efforts. Around this time, Kasparek started becoming more interested in conspiracy theories, becoming the basis of the next album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Black Hand Inn&quot;.

1995&#x27;s &quot;Masquerade&quot; was the first in a trilogy of albums dealing with a specific theme. The album would go on to be one of Running Wild&#x27;s worst selling albums up to that point. The second album followed with the 1998 album &quot;The Rivalry&quot; under their new label GUN Records with the conclusion of the trilogy culminating with 2000&#x27;s &quot;Victory&quot;. It would be the final album featuring drummer Jörg Michael. With so many line-up changes, Running Wild was considered a solo project due to the fact that guitarist and main songwriter Rolf Kasparek remained the sole constant member of the band. The album &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; was released in 2002. It was to be another three years before Running Wild released another album &quot;Rogues en Vogue&quot; in 2005.

=== &quot;The Final Jolly Roger&quot;, hiatus and reunion ===

On 17 April 2009, Rolf Kasparek announced the disbandment of Running Wild. The band performed their final show at Wacken Open Air on 30 July 2009, which would be recorded for a future DVD release. The resulting effort &quot;The Final Jolly Roger&quot; was released on 24 June 2011 on CD and DVD format. In May 2011, Kasparek explained that he did not want the band to return due to other desires of his own. A biography, titled &quot;Death and Glory: The Story of a Heavy Metal Legend&quot;, was announced in June 2011 that was tentatively scheduled for release in 2013 or 2014, but no more information was given since then. In October 2011, Running Wild reformed and announced that they would record a new album titled &quot;Shadowmaker&quot;, which was released on 20 April 2012 via SPV/Steamhammer. In November 2012, Kasparek and guitarist Peter Jordan formed a side project called Giant X, releasing an album titled &quot;I&quot; in January 2013.

The next album &quot;Resilient&quot; was released on 4 October 2013. The band made their return appearance at the 2015 edition of Wacken and included a brand new song from an upcoming album.

The sixteenth album &quot;Rapid Foray&quot; was released on 26 August 2016.

On 6 December 2019, an EP titled &quot;Crossing the Blades&quot; was released as an early hint for a new album.

Running Wild&#x27;s seventeenth album &quot;Blood on Blood&quot; was released on 29 October 2021. Their song &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; was elected by &quot;Loudwire&quot; as the 31st best metal song of 2021.

On 16 February 2023, former guitarist Michael &quot;Majk Moti&quot; Kupper died at the age of 65.

Running Wild is currently working on a new album, which is planned for release in early 2025.
