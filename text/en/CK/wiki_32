<text>Rolando Fonseca Jiménez (born 6 June 1974) is a Costa Rican former professional footballer who played as a forward.

Nicknamed &quot;El Principito&quot; (The little prince) and &quot;El Rolo&quot;, Fonseca usually played just off the main striker and was renowned for his ability to create opportunities for his teammates and his fierce long shot.

With 47 goals, Fonseca is the Costa Rica national team&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer.

==Club career==
Fonseca played for Comunicaciones in Guatemala, Independiente Medellín and América de Cali in Colombia, Pachuca and La Piedad in Mexico, as well as having home spells with Saprissa, Alajuelense and Municipal Liberia.

In Costa Rica, he played a total of 271 games, scoring over 100 goals, between the league&#x27;s two best teams, Saprissa and Alajuelense. His debut was with Deportivo Saprissa, on 1 June 1991, against ASODELI, and scored his first goal against San Carlos on 28 August. He also won Costa Rican championships in 1993–94, 1994–95 (Saprissa), and 1996–97, 2001–02, 2002–03 and 2004–05 (Alajuelense), adding three CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cups in 1993, 1995 (Saprissa), and 2004 (Alajuelense). Outside Costa Rica, Fonseca won league titles with Comunicaciones in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2008, and 2010, and with América de Cali in 1997.

After solid performances with Alajuelense and the national team, Fonseca received offers in 2007 from China, Chile, Turkey and Major League Soccer, but finally settled, as co-owner, player and captain of Municipal Liberia. Although he was having a great season, he left the project a few days before finishing the &quot;Apertura&quot; tournament, apparently due to personal issues and some differences with then co-owner Mario Sotela. Rumors surfaced that Fonseca would return to Alajuelense, but they were all quickly discarded.

After failed negotiations with Brujas, Fonseca returned to Comunicaciones, a team he had already represented on two other spells, remaining as one of side&#x27;s best imports ever. Fonseca retired in January 2011, but a year and seven months later, he made his return to professional football by joining Asociación Deportiva Carmelita on 19 August 2012. After three matches with Carmelita, he was released in September 2012. Coach Orlando de León cited that Fonseca has been busy with his other activities besides football.

==International career==
Fonseca has also been a fixture on the Costa Rica national team since 1992. He played in more than 100 internationals, and is currently the nation&#x27;s all-time scorer, with 47 goals.

Fonseca earned his first cap at the age of 17 on 27 May 1992, in a friendly match against Ecuador. By November of that year, he appeared in a 1994 World Cup qualifier against St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the first of his five World Cup qualifying campaigns for Costa Rica. The following year saw Fonseca&#x27;s first international goal, which came on 9 March in an UNCAF Nations Cup match against Panama.

By late 1996, Fonseca had become a regular in the national team, playing four World Cup qualifiers in the fall. He scored a hat trick against Honduras in the 1997 UNCAF Nations Cup, the first of three in his international career. He earned a call to the squad for the Copa América in Bolivia, but he appeared only in the first-round match against Mexico as the team lost all three group games.

At the turn of the millennium, Fonseca was entering the highest-scoring stretch of his international career; he scored eight times for Costa Rica in 1999, six times in 2000, and twelve times in 2001. During the same period, Costa Rica rose fast in CONCACAF, finishing in first place in World Cup qualifying. At the 2001 Copa América, Fonseca appeared in all four matches and scored against Bolivia, as the Costa Ricans won their first-round group with a team that also included Paulo César Wanchope, Walter Centeno, and Hernán Medford. Fonseca played in two games for the team at the 2002 World Cup, appearing in the first-round matches against China and Brazil.

Fonseca remained in the national team after the World Cup, playing in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup and scoring twice against the United States, but he was limited to only one cap in 2004 and two in 2005. He was excluded from the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad selected by Alexandre Guimarães. Upon the appointment of former teammate Medford as national coach, however, Fonseca returned to the national team in early 2007. He appeared only once for Costa Rica during the two-year span after the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup, but he was recalled late in 2009 for the last stages of World Cup qualifying by coach René Simões. Fonseca played his final competitive international match in the intercontinental playoff match against Uruguay on 18 November 2009, coming off the bench for the last 26 minutes.

His 47th and last international goal came against Chile, in a spectacular strike with his back to the goal, which also meant the number 1000 for Costa Rica in international matches. The all-time top scorer in the UNCAF Nations Cup with 19 goals, Fonseca was voted the tournament&#x27;s best player in 1999, adding five goals.

On 26 March 2011, Rolando Fonseca played in the first game of the new Costa Rican Estadio Nacional against China. He substituted Álvaro Saborío in the 78th minute. This was his last game with the Costa Rica national football team, as he retired from international play as Costa Rica&#x27;s all-time leading scorer.

<text>Sant Cugat del Vallès () is a town and municipality north of Barcelona, Catalonia. Known as &quot;Castrum Octavianum&quot; in antiquity (which literally means &quot;the castle of Octavianus&quot;) and as &quot;Pins del Vallès&quot; during the Second Spanish Republic, it is named after Saint Cucuphas, who is said to have been martyred on the spot now occupied by its medieval monastery. The final part of its toponym, &quot;del Vallès&quot;, is a reference to the historical county where the town is situated, Vallès. 

==Description==
In addition to the monastery, the town&#x27;s other notable buildings include the School of Architecture of the Vallès and the Centre d&#x27;Alt Rendiment (CAR, translit. High Performance Centre), a famous centre for professional sport training.

Sant Cugat has become an affluent suburb of Barcelona due to its location (only 20 kilometres from the city), its natural surroundings, and its pedestrian shopping area. Sant Cugat also offers restaurants, a concert venue, two cinemas, and one large shopping centre. It is also a political stronghold for conservative Catalan nationalism, with Convergència i Unió dominating the town&#x27;s politics for 32 years up until 2019 when the Republican Left of Catalonia took control of the City Council with the support of other political forces (PSC and CUP).

Sant Cugat has seen its population increase in recent years, with more births than bigger cities like Barcelona (2004). It has also practically merged with the nearby Rubí (population 72,987) and Cerdanyola del Vallès (population 58,747).

The town has its own train station with a direct metro connection into Barcelona city centre and the nearby industrial cities of Terrassa and Sabadell.
==Main sights==
These are some of the main sights of the municipality:
*Monastery of Sant Cugat
* (10th century)
* (10th century)
*&quot;Torre Negra&quot; (12th century)
* (14th century)

==Demography==
There are some districts, villages and towns in this municipality such as Mira-sol with 14,474 inhabitants; Valldoreix, which has a population of 8,272; La Floresta, which has 4,553 inhabitants, and Les Planes, which is inhabited by 1,290 people.

==Education==

The main secondary schools in Sant Cugat are IES Angeleta Ferrer i Sensat de Sant Cugat and the Institut Joaquima Pla i Farreras. 
The Japanese School of Barcelona, a Japanese international school, is located in the commune. The &quot;Hoshuko Barcelona Educación Japonesa/Escuela de Educación Japonesa en Barcelona&quot; (バルセロナ補習校 &quot;Baruserona Hoshūkō&quot;), a weekend supplementary Japanese school, holds its classes in the Japanese School of Barcelona building.

The European school of Barcelona (IES) is an international school focusing on international languages from outside Spain. Some of the most popular languages studied there are English, French and Chinese.

* A castellers club was formed in 1996.
* A diables club was formed in 1990.

<text>Rocinha (, ) is a favela in Brazil, located in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s South Zone between the districts of São Conrado and Gávea. Rocinha is built on a steep hillside overlooking Rio de Janeiro, and is located about one kilometre from a nearby beach. Most of the favela is on a very steep hill, with many trees surrounding it. Around 200,000 people live in Rocinha, making it the most populous in Rio de Janeiro.

Although Rocinha is officially categorized as a neighbourhood, many still refer to it as a favela. It developed from a shanty town into an urbanized slum. Today, almost all the houses in Rocinha are made from concrete and brick. Some buildings are three and four storeys tall and almost all houses have basic plumbing and electricity. Compared to simple shanty towns or slums, Rocinha has a better developed infrastructure and hundreds of businesses such as banks, medicine stores, bus routes, cable television, including locally based channel TV ROC (TV Rocinha), and, at one time, a McDonald&#x27;s franchise. These factors help classify Rocinha as a &quot;favela bairro&quot;, or favela neighborhood.

==Community==

There are a number of community organizations at work in Rocinha, including neighbourhood associations and numerous NGOs and non-profit educational and cultural institutions. Rocinha is home to most of the service workers in Zona Sul (the South Zone of Rio).

In recent years, due to its relative safety in comparison to other favelas, Rocinha has developed tourism-oriented activities such as hostels, nightclubs and guided tours. In September 2017, between 150 and 601 tourists were estimated to visit the slum per day, despite foreign governments&#x27; and the Rio police&#x27;s safety warnings recommending against it. In October 2017, a Spanish tourist died after being shot by the police while visiting Rocinha during a turf war.

During the years of 2014 to 2017, The slum was controlled by Amigos dos Amigos, although it is often caught in violent disputes among (and within) different criminal organizations.

===Police and military operations===
In November 2011, a security operation was undertaken where hundreds of police and military patrolled the streets of Rocinha to crack down on rampant drug dealers and bring government control to the neighbourhood.

In December 2017, drug kingpin Rogério da Silva, known as Rogério 157, was arrested in Rocinha, in an operation involving 3,000 members of the Brazilian military and police forces. Rogério was wanted on charges of homicide, extortion, and drug trafficking.

Rocinha is the largest favela in Brazil and one of the most developed. Rocinha&#x27;s population was estimated at between 150,000 and 300,000 inhabitants during the 2000s; but the IBGE Census of 2010 counted only 69,161 people. In 2017, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported a population of 100,000 in an area of 1 km2 (250 acres).

==In literature, film and music==
Robert Neuwirth discusses Rocinha in his book entitled &quot;Shadow Cities&quot;. Rio de Janeiro was made the setting for the animation film &quot;Rio&quot;, where many scenes take place in Rocinha.

Also, Rocinha is the setting of the book &quot;Nemesis: One Man and the Battle for Rio&quot; by Misha Glenny in which he describes the rise and fall of Antônio Francisco Bonfim Lopes.

In 1998, Philip Glass wrote an orchestral piece titled &quot;Days and Nights in Rocinha&quot;. It was meant as a reference to Ravel&#x27;s Boléro, written for Dennis Russell Davies, to thank him for putting Glass&#x27; works on stage. He was inspired by dance music that he heard during the carnival, resulting in a samba-like rhythmical structure with a lot of time signature changes and varieties, such as 14/8, 15/8 and 9/8+4/4.

The 2008 film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; featured aerial footage of Rocinha, showing the large number of intermodal containers repurposed as housing, and included an extensive chase scene filmed in the favela on the ground and across rooftops. It was also featured in the 2011 film &quot;Fast Five&quot;.

==In mass media and popular culture==

Many celebrities have visited Rocinha, including Mikhail Gorbachev (during the Earth Summit of 1992) and actor Christopher Lambert. Some episodes of the Brazilian television series &quot;Cidade dos Homens&quot; (&quot;City of Men&quot;) were filmed there.

===Video games===
* In the 2009 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, two of the main campaign missions and a multiplayer map based on it are set in the favela. 
* In &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops III&quot;, Rocinha is mentioned as the hometown of the specialist Outrider.
* In the 2015 tactical first-person shooter game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot;, a map called &quot;Favela&quot; is based on Rocinha.
* Harran, the city in which &quot;Dying Light&quot; takes place, was inspired in part by the favela.

<text>The Arnett Gardens Football Club is a Jamaican professional football club based in Kingston, which currently plays in the Jamaica Premier League.

The team is based in the Arnett Gardens community of South Saint Andrew, Jamaica, and plays in the Anthony Spaulding Sports Complex.

==History==
The team came out of a merger between the &quot;All Saints&quot; and &quot;Jones Town Football&quot; teams in 1977. Arnett&#x27;s fans originate primarily from Arnett Gardens and its adjoining communities – Jones Town, Craig Town, Hannah Town &amp; Admiral Town. The &quot;Junglists&quot;, as their fans are known, are very passionate and vociferous about their team and will travel all over the country in support of the team. The Arnett Gardens part of Kingston is popularly known as the &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot;, hence the nickname of the club.

The club won the league in its first season, 1978. Although it suffered a long drought after that, it re-emerged at the start of the new millennium, winning both the 2000–01 and 2001–02 championships.

===Recent seasons and managerial changes===
The start of the 2007–08 season proved to be one of their worst ever and forced coach Max Straw to resign on 14 January 2008 to be replaced by former coach Jerome Waite, who led Arnett Gardens to the celebrated back-to-back titles of 2001 and 2002. They then finished the season four points above the relegation zone after winning 3 of their final 4 games.

Waite himself was axed after only four games into the 2008–09 season, losing all games and managing to score only one goal. He was replaced by Fabian Davis, who left his post at the end of 2009. As of January 2010, Wayne Fairclough was the team&#x27;s coach but he decided to quit in October 2010. Fairclough was succeeded by former national team striker Paul Davis.

Davis took them to a creditable 5th place in the 2012–13 season, his third with the club, before he resigned in November 2012 citing a lack of commitment from the players and other issues within the club. In October 2013, his successor Calvin Lewis resigned and his place was taken by former coach Jerome Waite.

Alex Thomas took over the reins for the 2019–20 season. On October 22, 2021, he had resigned from his position as head coach.

On October 26, 2021, Paul Davis was announced as the newly appointed head coach.

Xavier Gilbert was appointed as the new head coach on August 21, 2023. On August 5, Arnett Gardens F.C. won their first ever international cup, the CFU Club Shield, by defeating Grenades F.C. at the Stadion Rignaal &#x27;Jean&#x27; Francisca, Willemstad.

<doc id="1126693" wikidata="Q1646498" url="?curid=1126693" title="Little Sioux River">
<text>The Little Sioux River is a river in the United States. It rises in southwestern Minnesota near the Iowa border, and continues to flow southwest for across northwest Iowa into the Missouri River at Little Sioux. The Little Sioux River was known as Eaneah-waudepon or &quot;Stone River&quot; to the Sioux Indians. Its tributaries include the Ocheyedan River, Maple River and the West Fork of the Little Sioux River. The Little Sioux River is integral to the Nepper Watershed Project, a major Iowa flood control and soil conservation program that was introduced in 1947.

At Turin, Iowa, the Little Sioux River has a mean annual discharge of 1,761 cubic feet per second.

==History==
Prior to the sale of French Louisiana to the United States, the river was known as the &quot;Rivière des Aiaouez&quot; meaning &quot;River of the Ioways&quot;.
The Little Sioux Valley was important in the Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857, when the Santee Sioux chief Inkpaduta made forays as far downstream as Smithland. The river valley also figures prominently in folklore about the nineteenth century outlaw, Jesse James, who reportedly used the secluded valley, with its wooded ravines, as a hideout and a route north to Minnesota during the 1870s.

==Geology==
Geologically, the Little Sioux rises in a region of glacial potholes near the &quot;Iowa Great Lakes&quot; (Spirit Lake, and East and West Okoboji). It then traverses a rich agricultural region on its way to the Loess Hills, from which it then flows out onto the floodplain of the Missouri River. Through much of its middle course (i.e., from Linn Grove to Smithland) the Little Sioux is a relatively wild meandered stream, with excellent canoeing, camping, and fishing opportunities. However, from Smithland downstream to its mouth, the river has been channelized and environmentally degraded.

==Flooding==
Flooding of the river is common in early to late spring, as the often-heavy winter snow melts. This has resulted in riparian woodlands of cottonwood trees adjacent to fertile farm ground on the bottomlands. Correspondingly, hunters are rewarded with a bounty of white-tailed deer, rabbits and pheasants during the fall hunting season.

==Fishing==
Fishing opportunities are best in late spring after flood waters have dissipated. Edible gamefish such as bullhead and channel catfish are frequently caught with nothing more than a hook and worm, with northern pike, walleye, and shovelnose sturgeon also available.

<text>The University of London Institute in Paris (ULIP; ) is a central academic body of the University of London located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It is the only British university institute in continental Europe.

==History==

The institute was established by an English woman, Edith Williams, in 1894, with the support of the then British ambassador, Lord Dufferin. It was originally known as the &quot;Franco-British Guild&quot;, which from 1894 offered classes in conversational English to French students soon to qualify as teachers of English through more theoretical studies. In 1900, French classes were added, aimed at British students spending time in Paris, and thus a unique Franco-British community was created. In the same year, the guild established itself in the rue de la Sorbonne, opposite the University of Paris.

After the First World War the French and British governments, concerned by the lack of a common language between the British and French armies that had become apparent during hostilities, sought means of improving cultural and linguistic links between their countries. The French government founded an Institut français du Royaume-Uni in London (South Kensington), while another British ambassador to France, Lord Crewe, launched a fund for the creation of a British Institute in Paris. This was to consist of a bi-cultural teaching establishment (the guild, reorganised and expanded) and a Franco-British student hostel in the international Cité Universitaire, which was eventually opened in 1937 under the name Collège Franco-Britannique. As part of the new British Institute in Paris, the guild received the support of a number of British universities, including the University of London, as well as forming an integral part of the University of Paris. In addition to facilities for teaching, a library and clubroom were added to the guild&#x27;s premises at this time and prominent French and British academics and intellectuals were invited to give lectures.

The British Institute left its Sorbonne link to become incorporated into the University of London in 1969.

The British Institute was renamed the University of London Institute in Paris in 2005. The institute worked closely with Queen Mary University of London and Royal Holloway, University of London, who were members of a consortium established with the Central University in 2004 to create mutual benefits in a number of areas of academic and support activity. From September 2016, Queen Mary University of London took over the functions provided by Royal Holloway and all students are now considered registered students of Queen Mary University of London.

Although the institute began life teaching oral English to the French, it was soon improving the oral French of visiting British students; currently the institute&#x27;s teaching centres around its BA courses in French studies, complemented by a growing portfolio of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in international relations, urban studies, business, and law. The English language programme has been discontinued – classes are now provided by the British Council – as ULIP has looked to develop itself as a research-led institute.

Today ULIP shares its building with the British Council, which &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper has described as a &quot;lovely, traditional Paris building, in a great location overlooking the Esplanade des Invalides&quot;. Its strength is that because it is a relatively small institution it can offer a more intimate learning experience than is available in a larger, more anonymous University. It has the unique advantage of allowing students to study French culture and language in the country itself whilst still offering the student support and quality assurance of a British educational institution. The quality of its degrees is ratified either by the University of London, or by Queen Mary University of London, depending on the programme studied. As a result of these advantages the entrance requirements for students are relatively high (AAB or ABB at A level (or equivalent) for undergraduate programmes and a 2:1 (or equivalent) for postgraduate programmes). 76% of its undergraduate students are women, 24% men; 65% of its postgraduate students are women and 35% are men.

==Academics==
The institute offers two three-year undergraduate courses: a BA in French Studies, which can be combined with minors in History, Business, or International Relations. And a BA in International Politics (taught in English), which can be studied with a minor in French Studies. Both courses offered result in a University of London qualification.

At postgraduate level the institute offers a Master of Arts in Urban History and Culture and a Master of Laws. Both postgraduate courses are taught in collaboration with Queen Mary University of London: the MA in Urban History and Culture receives a University of London degree. The Master of Laws is taught and awarded by Queen Mary University of London and can be taken either as a single degree lasting 12 months, or as a dual degree, with the Sorbonne, lasting 18 months.

The institute hosts a large number of academic seminars, workshops and conferences that bring together leading British and French scholars and scientists in a range of academic subjects. It is also home to the Paris Centre for Migrant Writing and Expression – a research centre working with academics, students, asylum seekers and refugees in Paris to investigate varied questions of mobility and displacement, translation, multilingualism, and cultural transfer.

==Notable people==
Former directors include Francis Scarfe (1959–78), Harley Granville Barker (1937–39), and Andrew Hussey (2008–14).

Former students include the artist Françoise Gilot, who was Picasso&#x27;s partner between 1944 and 1953 and author of the bestselling &quot;Life with Picasso&quot;, the BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce, and Queen Camilla.

<doc id="1126701" wikidata="Q3998171" url="?curid=1126701" title="Treasons Act 1571">
<text>The Treasons Act 1571 (13 Eliz. 1. c. 1) was an Act of the Parliament of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. It restored the provisions of the Treasons Act 1534, which had been passed by Parliament during the reign of her father, King Henry VIII, and then repealed by the Treason Act 1547 at the beginning of the reign of her half-brother, King Edward VI.
== The Act ==
It became high treason to intend bodily harm to the Queen, or to levy war against her, or incite others to levy war against her, or to say that she ought not to enjoy the Crown, or publish in writing that she is a heretic, tyrant or usurper, or to claim a right to the Crown or usurp it during the Queen&#x27;s life, or to assert that somebody else has the right of succession to the throne, or to say that the laws enacted by Parliament do not govern the succession to the throne.

== Legacy ==
The Act was repealed on 28 July 1863 by the Statute Law Revision Act 1863. However until 1967 it remained treason under the Succession to the Crown Act 1707 to say that Parliament could not control the succession to the Crown.

Some of the wording of section 5 of the Treasons Act 1571 has drawn attention for its description of the legal line of succession. In the twenty-first century, academic scholarship and proponents of the Oxfordian theory of Shakespearean authorship noted the departure of the terms &quot;heirs of the body&quot; to the introduction of the phrase &quot;natural issue&quot; to refer to the line of succession, or Queen&#x27;s heir to the throne:

Proponents contend this wording meant that any illegitimate child, or &quot;natural issue&quot;, born to Queen Elizabeth I, would then be legal successor to the monarchy. As of 2016, scholarship continues to debate the implications of the change in the legal language, but agree its inclusion in the Act was meant to prevent a crisis of succession.

<text>Harbour View Football Club is a Jamaican football club based in Kingston that currently plays in the top flight Jamaica Premier League.

Harbour View F.C. is nicknamed the &quot;Stars of the East&quot; or &quot;Easters&quot; and play their home games at Harbour View Stadium.

==History==
Founded by Vin Blaine along with the Harbour View community in the 1960s, the professional club, Harbour View F.C, was officially established on March 4, 1974. Then, 25 years later, the club was officially incorporated as a limited liability company and was the first Jamaica football club to become incorporated.

Harbour View F.C. has developed a reputation for being the first in Jamaica in many aspects. The &quot;Stars of the East&quot; became the first club to have an official website, and the first to build a world-class football stadium. Ricardo Gardner was the inaugural Jamaica Premier League player to transfer to a major European league after joining the Bolton Wanderers in 1998. Club management is also setting the pace in bringing true professionalism to Jamaica&#x27;s football landscape. In addition, at the beginning of the 2006 season, the club&#x27;s equipment was sponsored by Adidas. The club generates revenue through sponsorships, match tickets, and other businesses such as stadium bars and Western Union.

Haig&#x27;s second play &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot; was also first staged at the Hampstead Theatre, opening on 6 July 2000. His third play &quot;Pressure&quot; premiered at the Chichester Festival in 2014, before being revived in 2018 on a UK Tour and then in the West End at the Ambassadors Theatre.

<doc id="1126709" wikidata="Q7726975" url="?curid=1126709" title="The Commanding Heights">
<text>The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy is a book by Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw first published as &quot;The Commanding Heights: The Battle Between Government and the Marketplace That Is Remaking the Modern World&quot; in 1998. In 2002, it was adapted as a documentary of the same title and later released on DVD.

&quot;The Commanding Heights&quot; attempts to trace the rise of free markets during the last century as well as the process of globalization. Yergin attributes the origin of the phrase commanding heights to a speech by Vladimir Lenin referring to the control of perceived key segments of a national economy.

== Overview ==

The authors take the thesis that prior to World War I, the world effectively lived in a state of globalization, which they term the First Era of Globalization. The authors define globalization as periods in which free markets predominate and countries place few, if any, limits on exports, immigration, imports, or information exchanges. Overall, they see globalization as a positive movement that improves the standard of living for all the people connected to it, from the richest to the poorest. According to the authors, the rise of communism and fascism, not to mention the Great Depression, nearly extinguished capitalism, which rapidly lost popularity.

After World War II, the authors note that the work of economist John Maynard Keynes came to be widely accepted in Western economies. Keynes believed in government regulation of the economy, which the authors underline as Keynes&#x27; great influence and prestige. The authors consider that the so-called commanding heights were often owned or severely regulated by governments in accordance with Keynes&#x27; ideas.

The authors then discuss how the political changes of the 1980s ushered in accompanying changes in economic policy. The old trend changed when Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and when Ronald Reagan was elected President of the United States. Both leaders parted ways with Keynesian economics and governed more in the tradition of the works of Friedrich Hayek, who opposed government regulation, tariffs, and other infringements on a pure free market and those of Milton Friedman, who emphasized the futility of using inflationary monetary policies to influence rates of economic growth. 

In practice, Hayek&#x27;s policies were applied only selectively, as Reagan&#x27;s 1986 income tax reforms substantially increased taxes on the lowest quintile of wage-earners but dramatically decreased rates for the upper two quintiles. In contrast to Hayek&#x27;s ideas, Reagan&#x27;s policies also continued and expanded tax write-offs, rebates and subsidies for many large corporations. Friedman&#x27;s monetarism was also abandoned in practice as government-issued debt as a percentage of GDP rose dramatically throughout the 1980s. While Thatcher, Reagan, and their successors made sweeping reforms, the authors argue that the current era of globalization finally began around 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since then, they assert countries embracing free markets have prospered on the whole, and those adhering to central planning have failed.

While strongly in favor of this trend, the authors worry that globalization will not last. More specifically, they believe that if inequality in economic growth remains high and if Third World nations are not offered the proper opportunities and incentives to support capitalism, the movement will end just as the first era did. The authors place so much emphasis on narrowing economic gaps because they believe, contrary to many of the people who are interviewed, that there is no ideological support for capitalism, only the pragmatic fact that the system works better than any other, as they remark:
== International analysis ==

In the book, the authors examine briefly many different nations and regions and their economic development since World War II. (In the case of industrialized countries, they often begin before the war.) Admitting that the book cannot touch on every single aspect (Yergin remarks that the topic of their book constitutes an entire new academic discipline), the authors make many assertions.

=== United States ===

The robber barons were often condemned in the press, but the United States had much more commitment to industrialization and free markets than did other countries in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. Unlike many countries after World War I, the 1920s saw great economic expansion for upper-income individuals and a growth in median income. However, labor unrest continued to mount throughout the 1920s and the 1930s because of the lack of wage and hour rules, child labor protections, unemployment insurance, right to organize, workplace safety requirements, and social security, which all continued to exacerbate the discontents of the substantial numbers of working poor.

The Great Depression caused massive unemployment and massive public distrust of corporations and wealthy individuals. In response, the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt went into effect with massive public support. Many lawyers and economists, influenced by Keynes, worked under the New Deal and believed that free markets would lead to disaster without proper regulation.

The American economy boomed for about 30 years after World War II with the benefit of Keynesianism, robust antitrust regulation to promote competition and financial regulations preventing the most volatile forms of market speculation, high unionization rates and protections promoting the growth of domestic industry. However, during the 1970s, stagflation was brought on by the 1973 oil crisis and the shift from the gold standard to fiat currency, which discredited the policy consensus that was set in place by the New Deal Coalition. Eventually, Ronald Reagan was elected as president in 1980, and many of the statutes and organizations created by the New Deal were dismantled.

=== United Kingdom ===

London was the center of the so-called First Era of Globalization because of the power and resources of the British Empire. However, World War I severely weakened Britain, causing massive unemployment. The United Kingdom successfully held out during World War II and emerged victorious, but the war effectively caused the dismantling of its empire.

Winston Churchill was influenced by the work of Hayek and opposed heavy government interference in the British economy. However, the Labour Party, led by Clement Attlee, came to power in force after the 1945 general election and was dedicated to government controls to prevent another economic crisis. The United Kingdom&#x27;s major industries were nationalized over the following decades (including the Bank of England, electricity, water, natural gas, railways, mining, bus transport, telecommunications, along with large portions of the oil, shipbuilding, aerospace, automotive, and steel industries. 

Basic human services such as healthcare and university education were brought under government control and made available for free, while rents in the private housing market were regulated and council housing provided homes for around a third of the population by the late 1970s. Meanwhile, practically all occupations and wages were heavily regulated and unionized.

The practices became so prevalent that even Conservative governments elected after the initial wave of nationalisations in the late 1940s kept them. However, during the 1970s, massive strikes by unions (see the Three-Day Week and Winter of Discontent) and other economic woes, such as the 1973 oil crisis, almost ground the British economy to a halt. Thatcher, an ardent admirer of Hayek, began privatizatizing industries. While her results were initially mixed, the Falklands War brought on a nationalistic fervor that kept Thatcher in office long enough to keep her reforms in place. Even when the Labour Party later came back to power, it did not attempt to challenge the key principles of Thatcherism.

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===

Within a few years of the rise of the Russian Revolution, the Soviet economy went into a major crisis. Lenin responded with the New Economic Policy, a program that allowed limited capitalistic activity, which resulted in what he would call state capitalism, and the economy began to improve. Lenin&#x27;s commanding heights speech was his attempt to defend himself against accusations that he sold out the principles of the revolution by implementing the new policy.

Under Joseph Stalin, the Soviet agricultural and heavy manufacturing sectors were largely centralized. During the 1940s to the 1970s, the Soviet economy grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations.

By the 1980s, however, the Soviet economy was in shambles. Because of a lack of incentives and, ironically, a more tolerant central government, workers did not put much effort into their duties. Nonetheless, the Soviet Union continued to build the military even though at times such spending took up half the country&#x27;s revenue. Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform the economy, but he took only limited steps (see perestroika and glasnost). When he lifted the Brezhnev Doctrine and allowed Poland&#x27;s Solidarity to usurp that country&#x27;s communist regime, the entire Warsaw Pact collapsed, soon followed by the Soviet Union itself.

However, even with the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of the relatively free market-minded Boris Yeltsin, former members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union maintained much power in Russia, blocked free-market movements, and forced the resignation of Yeltsin&#x27;s free-market allies such as Yegor Gaidar. During the 1996 presidential election, Yeltsin was forced to accept support from Russian oligarchs to counter the growing power of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. While Yeltsin remained in power, the privatization of industries proceeded extremely unequally.

=== Germany ===

As had been predicted by Keynes, the hyperinflation caused by the Treaty of Versailles devastated the German economy and created political instability. In addition to widespread unemployment, the hyperinflation effectively wiped out the country&#x27;s middle class. That environment made it easy for the Nazi Party to gain power. The authors also argue that the Nazis practiced central planning although industries were privatized en masse.

After the war and the division of Germany, East Germany came under the rule of the Soviets, and West Germany remained part of the Western powers. When economic conditions in occupied West Germany failed to improve, Ludwig Erhard completely destroyed price controls in 1948 without consulting the occupying powers. Western Germany underwent a fast massive economic recovery, but such free-market reforms were largely confined to that country for many years.

By the time of German reunification in 1989, West Germany was an economic power, and East Germany faced many problems because of the collapse of the central planning authority.

=== India ===

Unlike Mahatma Gandhi, who supported a village-centric economy, after India&#x27;s independence in 1947, its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, promoted industrialization. However, he supported government-controlled development and the bureaucracy that developed stifled innovation. The authors of &quot;The Commanding Heights&quot; describe this as the British Raj being replaced by a &quot;permit Raj&quot;, using a sarcastic term coined by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari. Bribery and delays became common in the Indian economy while many prominent economists studied the country and attempted to finetune its central planning.

By the 1990s, the Indian government began to relax these stringent regulations mainly under the influence of Finance Minister and later Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The Indian economy bloomed under the effects of exports and outsourcing, and political parties since then have continued to promote those changes. The free-marketer Singh was appointed prime minister when his party won the elections in 2004 although he was not the victorious United Progressive Alliance&#x27;s stated candidate, and the general expectation was that Sonia Gandhi would take the seat.

=== South America ===

Under the influence of dependency theory, a Marxist approach to international economics, many Latin American countries attempted to industrialize by limiting imports of manufactured goods and subsidizing their own industries. However, companies had little incentive to become efficient or innovative in the absence of competition and in the presence of government subsidies. By the 1980s, the economic problems of the countries became obvious, and much of the West&#x27;s investment was lost.

Chile became an experiment in free markets when Augusto Pinochet called in followers of Friedman to evaluate the economy, the so-called Chicago boys. The authors argue that the economic reforms proved successful, but since Pinochet was a dictator who came to power in a coup and had many political opponents murdered, the whole idea of free-market reform became linked to fascism. Though the authors and Friedman claim that the reforms eventually promoted democracy, they acknowledge that the issue and their interpretation of events are extremely controversial.

Bolivia was hit with hyperinflation as well. During the 1980s, economist Jeffrey Sachs was sent as a consultant and new President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada reined in inflation in the 1990s by severely cutting government spending. While Bolivia remained a very poor country, the authors argue that it is better off now because its inflation was curtailed. They also argue that Bolivia&#x27;s example expunges the bad reputation that free-market economics acquired in Chile as Bolivia&#x27;s reforms came after a democratic election.

=== Other countries ===

The authors argue that Africa&#x27;s economic development was severely hindered by central planning, socialist ideas, and political dictatorships that promoted warfare and other conflicts.

While Japan was seen for many years as an economic success story as late as the early 1990s, the authors argue that its ongoing recession since then resulted from its governments refusal to stop subsidies to many of its industries and companies (the issue is ongoing).

Poland&#x27;s free-market reforms pushed by Solidarity and Lech Wałęsa were initially mixed and criticized by its citizens, but by the late 1990s, the Polish economy was doing much better than other former communist states in the Eastern Bloc. One feature of the Polish economy that makes it different from other capitalistic countries is that it is dominated by small business rather than corporations or conglomerates.

China is another major ongoing issue. While Deng Xiaoping, after the death of Mao Zedong, gradually freed the economy, he did not promote civil liberties or other political freedoms, as was demonstrated by his willingness to crush pro-democracy demonstrators. While the authors hope according to Friedman&#x27;s ideas that free markets would eventually promote a free society, it has not yet happened although China&#x27;s economy continues to grow.

== Documentary ==

In 2002, PBS aired a six-hour documentary based on the book. This documentary was later sold on DVD and is available to view for free at PBS&#x27;s website. The documentary is narrated by David Ogden Stiers.

The documentary series consists of three, two-hour episodes:
* Episode 1: The Battle of Ideas Produced and Directed by William Cran.
* Episode 2: The Agony of Reform Produced and Directed by William Cran, Co-Producer Peter Sommer, Co-Director Greg Barker.
* Episode 3: The New Rules of the Game Directed, Written and Produced by Greg Barker.

Appearing several years after the book was released allowed the documentary film to address many of the items that Yergin and Stanislaw missed in their original book, including the collapse of Asian economies, the anti-globalization movement and the September 11 attacks. All told, two of the documentary&#x27;s six hours (the entire final third) address things that happened since the original book was published. They also include free market solutions to international poverty that were not included in the book, and they interview economist Hernando de Soto, whose book on the subject was not published until after the initial printing of &quot;The Commanding Heights&quot;.

Like the book, the documentary attracted more support and criticism. One example is the anti-globalization movement, which argued they were portrayed unfairly. In the documentary, James Wolfensohn, then President of the World Bank, is interviewed and says that such protesters are attacking people &quot;who are devoting their lives to addressing the very questions that these people claim to be addressing&quot;. The documentary includes a scene of Wolfensohn getting hit in the face with a pie by a protester.

In contrast to the book, the PBS documentary is more wary of the possible end of the current era of globalization. For example, they include a parallel between radio stocks of the 1920s and dot com stocks of the 1990s: both were industries built on new technology that had little capital, but fell prey to a market bubble. Likewise, the documentary makes a comparison between the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the terrorist assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. Venture Capitalist Tim Draper appears in the third episode and speaks about his success at the time with Hotmail for email and other early internet investments. This was many years before Draper would go on to invest in many other successful tech companies of the 2000&#x27;s, including Tesla, Coinbase, and even a large purchase of Bitcoin from a sale of the cryptocurrency after the fall of the Silk Road after 2013. 

The production was financed by donations from Electronic Data Systems, FedEx, BP, The Pew Charitable Trusts, John Templeton Foundation, Smith Richardson Foundation, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

<text>Étretat () is a commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region of Northwestern France. It is a tourist and farming town situated about northeast of Le Havre, at the junction of the D 940, D 11 and D 139 roads. It is located on the coast of the Pays de Caux area.

==The cliffs==
Étretat is best known for its chalk cliffs, including three natural arches and a pointed formation called &quot;L&#x27;Aiguille&quot; or the Needle, which rises above the sea. The Etretat Chalk Complex, as it is known, consists of a complex stratigraphy of Turonian and Coniacian chalks. Some of the cliffs are as high as .

These cliffs and the associated resort beach attracted artists including Eugène Boudin, Charles Daubigny, Gustave Courbet and Claude Monet. They were featured prominently in the 1909 Arsène Lupin novel &quot;The Hollow Needle&quot; by Maurice Leblanc. They also feature in the 2014 film &quot;Lucy&quot;, directed by Luc Besson.

Two of the three famous arches are visible from the town, the Porte d&#x27;Aval, and the Porte d&#x27;Amont. The Manneporte is the third and the biggest one, and cannot be seen from the town.

The GR 21 long-distance hiking path (Le Havre to Le Tréport) passes through the town.

==&quot;The White Bird&quot;==

Étretat is known for being the last place in France from which the 1927 biplane &quot;The White Bird&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot;) was seen. French World War I war heroes Charles Nungesser and François Coli were attempting to make the first non-stop flight from Paris to New York City, but after the plane&#x27;s 8 May 1927 departure, it disappeared somewhere over the Atlantic. It is considered one of the great unexplained mysteries of aviation. A monument to the flight was established in Étretat, but destroyed during World War II, when the Germans occupied the area. A new and taller monument was constructed in 1963, along with a nearby museum.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

The economy of Étretat rests mainly on tourism, which gives the locals a growing commercial outlet. The city places itself as the number one tourist attraction in Normandy, as the site most visited along with Bénédictine distillery and museum at Fécamp, the Rouen Cathedral and the Claude Monet Foundation in Giverny.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the economy was supplemented by kelp-burning on the beaches. The white plumes of smoke by the shore can be clearly seen in George Inness&#x27; painting &#x27;Étretat&#x27; (1875, Wadsworth Athenaeum). &quot;The discovery and development of iodine-rich mineral deposits in Chile about the same time the iodine-from-kelp industry reached full vigor, dealt the kelp industry another severe blow in the late 1870s. However, small quantities of kelp continued to be harvested for soda, potash and iodine in northern France&quot;.

==Notable people==

Étretat was the birthplace of Élie Halévy (1870–1937), philosopher and historian.

Guy de Maupassant (1850–1893) spent most of his childhood in Étretat, at &quot;Les Verguies&quot;. In 1882 he wrote a short story for Le Gaulois entitled &quot;The Englishman of Étretat&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Anglais d&#x27;Étretat&quot;), based on encounters in 1868, as a house guest of G. E. J. Powell, with the English poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, whom he had helped save from drowning. The dried human hand displayed on one of the tables was later acquired by Maupassant to adorn his Paris apartment; it inspired another short story, &quot;The Flayed Hand&quot; (&quot;La Main Écorchée&quot;). In 1883 he built his own house in Étretat, &quot;La Guillette&quot;, in the Mediterranean style in &quot;Le Grand Val&quot;, since renamed &quot;rue Guy-de-Maupassant&quot;. 

Jean-Baptiste Faure (1830–1914), the great French operatic baritone whose career centred on Paris and London, also owned a villa there. A friend of the artist Édouard Manet and a keen collector of art, Faure did amateur paintings of the local area, including the scenic cliff.

Claude Monet did several paintings in the area particularly of the natural cliff arches and stacks.

Jacques Offenbach had a villa there called “Villa d&#x27;Orphée”, named after his operetta, &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;.  

==In popular media==
Much of the filming for the fifth episode of the first season of &quot;Lupin&quot; was completed in and near the commune. This location is significant because Maurice Leblanc, the creator of the character Arsène Lupin (a fictional master thief) featured in 17 novels and 39 novellas, lived in the commune. He wrote much of the series at his home. (In total, Leblanc wrote over 60 novels and short stories.) That home is now the Clos Lupin Museum.

<doc id="1126715" wikidata="Q386484" url="?curid=1126715" title="Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł (1734–1790)">
<text>Prince Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł (, Exonym: &quot;Charles Stanislaus&quot;: 27 February 1734 – 21 November 1790) was a Polish–Lithuanian nobleman, diplomat and prince of the Commonwealth. He is frequently referred to by his well-known sobriquet Panie Kochanku (&quot;My Beloved Sir&quot;) to distinguish him from his earlier namesake. Prince Radziwiłł held several important posts; from 1752 he was the Master Swordbearer of the Lithuania, and in 1757 he became one of the first recipients of the Order of the White Eagle. From 1762 he was Voivode of Vilnius.

Radziwiłł was born on 27 February 1734 to General-Hetman Michał Kazimierz &quot;Rybeńko&quot; Radziwiłł and Princess Urszula Franciszka Wiśniowiecka and spent his childhood in Nieśwież, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was then part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1767 he became Marshal General of the Radom Confederation and, the following year, Marshal of the Bar Confederation. After its fall in 1772 he emigrated, but in 1777 returned to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and resumed all his previous posts after having first pledged his loyalty to Polish King Stanisław II Augustus, whom he had previously opposed. During the Great Sejm from 1788 until his death in 1790 he was a leading opponent of reform, King Stanisław Augustus and his allies; the members of the so-called &quot;Familia&quot; political party headed by the Czartoryski family.

Radziwiłł was the wealthiest magnate in Poland-Lithuania, in the second half of the 18th century. However, he was popular among the poorer nobility. Suffering from obesity and the after-effects of alcoholism, in the spring of 1790 Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł moved to the town of Biała Podlaska in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, where he died on November 21 leaving no issue to inherit his enormous wealth.

Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz stated that Radziwiłł was a &quot;citizen with a heart of stone whose sacrifices for the Polish nation were remarkable and unforgettable&quot;. Radziwiłł was also immortalized in &quot;Rejtan, the Fall of Poland&quot;, an oil painting by the Polish artist Jan Matejko, finished in 1866, depicting the protest of Tadeusz Rejtan against the First Partition of Poland during the Partition Sejm of 1773. Both a depiction of a historical moment, and an allegory for the surrounding period of Polish history, the painting is one of Matejko&#x27;s most famous works, and an iconic picture of an emotional protest.

Pantler Horeszko, from the epic poem &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; by Adam Mickiewicz, was loosely based on Karol Stanisław Radziwiłł.

The prince owned a house on the &quot;Rue Neuve des Bons Enfants&quot; in Paris. The street is now called Rue Radziwill.

<doc id="1126719" wikidata="Q1765879" url="?curid=1126719" title="Leading actor">
<text>A leading actor, leading actress, or leading man or lady or simply lead (), plays a main role in a film, television show or play. The word &quot;lead&quot; may also refer to the largest role in the piece, and &quot;leading actor&quot; may refer to a person who typically plays such parts or an actor with a respected body of work. Some actors are typecast as leads, but most play the lead in some performances and supporting or character roles in others.

Sometimes there is more than one significant leading role in a dramatic piece, and the actors are said to play &quot;co-leads&quot;; a large supporting role may be considered a &quot;secondary lead&quot;. Award nominations for acting often reflect such ambiguities. Therefore, sometimes two actors in the same performance piece are nominated Oscars for Best Actor or Best Actress—categories traditionally reserved for leads. For example, in 1935 Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone were each nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;. There can even be controversy over whether a particular performance should be nominated in the Best Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Best Supporting Actress category; for instance, &quot;The Godfather&#x27;s&quot; Al Pacino boycotted the 45th Academy Awards ceremony since he was insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor award; he noted that he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor winner Marlon Brando and so he should have received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

A title role is often but not necessarily the lead. A lead role must also be differentiated from a starring role, which means that an actor is credited as a part of the main cast but not that they necessarily play the main character.

<text>The TT Premier Football League (formerly known as the TT Pro League) is the Trinidad and Tobago professional league for association football clubs. It is the country&#x27;s primary football competition and serves as the top division in the Trinidad and Tobago football league system. Contested by twelve clubs, the league is one of the world&#x27;s few football leagues that does not operate on an automatic system of promotion and relegation. Seasons run from September to May, with teams playing 18 games each totaling 90 games in the season. Most games are played in the evenings of Fridays (&quot;Super Fridays&quot;) and Saturdays (&quot;Fiesta Saturdays&quot;), with a few games played during weekday evenings. TTPFL clubs also play in other competitions, such as the FA Trophy, League Cup, &quot;TOYOTA Classic&quot;, Goal Shield, and Pro Bowl against domestic clubs from other divisions; and against clubs from other countries in the CFU Club Shield, CONCACAF Caribbean Cup, and the CONCACAF Champions Cup.

The TT Premier Football League was founded as part of a need for a professional league to strengthen the country&#x27;s national team and improve the development of its domestic players. The league is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders and was inaugurated on 5 January 1999 under the name &quot;Professional Football League&quot; before switching to its current name after three years of existence. The TT Premier Football League headquarters is located northwest of Trinidad and Tobago in St. Augustine. The league is currently sponsored by Digicel and thus officially known as the Digicel Pro League. The TT Premier Football League is currently ranked 135th in the world and 12th in CONCACAF based on results during the previous calendar year according to the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS).

Since 1908, a total of 24 clubs have been crowned champions of the Trinidad and Tobago football system. Of the 22 distinct clubs to have competed in the TT Pro League since its inception, six have won the title: W Connection (6 titles), San Juan Jabloteh (4), Defence Force and Central FC (3), Joe Public (2), and North East Stars (2). The current champions are W Connection after the club won their 6th Pro League title in the 2018 season, 13 years after their first in 2004.

==History==

===Origins (1974–1993)===
Prior to the 1990s, professionalism in Trinidad and Tobago football was non-existent. In the 1970s and 1980s, the &quot;National League&quot;, composed primarily of amateur players, served as the highest level in the Trinidad and Tobago football league system. However, it was during this period Trinidad and Tobago experienced an upswing in support for football following a rise in international success at both club and national team levels. In 1985, Defence Force became only the second team from CONCACAF to accomplish the continental treble after the club won the National League, FA Trophy, and CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. Coupled with the &quot;Strike Squad&#x27;s&quot; near qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, optimism for the country&#x27;s first appearance at the World Cup was at an all-time high.

However, the early 1990s marked a low point in Trinidad and Tobago football. In 1993, after a streak of poor performances, the &quot;Soca Warriors&quot; gave its worst ever showing in the Caribbean Cup after finishing a disappointing third, which was preceded with an early exit from its 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification attempt. In response, Trinidadian and former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner spoke out describing Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s football as being &quot;in shambles&quot; and crowd support was &quot;non-existent&quot;.

===Foundation (1994–1998)===
In November 1995, Jack Warner proposed that creating a professional league to produce homegrown players would function as the building blocks to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. In fact, speaking on the importance of a professional league for the future, Warner stated &quot;professionalism or death for Trinidad and Tobago football.&quot; His proposal, which included the clubs&#x27; ability to operate as business entities, laid the foundation for professional football in Trinidad and Tobago.

In order to successfully develop a professional football league in the country, the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association 
established the &quot;Semi-Professional League&quot; in 1996 to provide teams and players with a semi-professional environment, as they transitioned during a three-year period for life in a professional league. In particular, clubs were issued three important criteria that would be used for professional league admission:

* The incoming club must show proof of a home venue to stage matches,
* The incoming club must provide a minimum wage of TT$2,000 per month to a contracted player,
* The incoming club must have a minimum of sixteen (16) contracted players, a manager, and a physiotherapist.

After the final season of the &quot;Semi-Professional League&quot;, several clubs were denied admission after failing to meet the aforementioned criteria. Clubs were also faced with supplying the professional league a bank draft guaranteeing TT$400,000 for admission.

===Development (1999–2008)===


The Trinidad and Tobago all-professional league, called the &quot;Professional Football League&quot;, was founded on 5 January 1999 with its inaugural season held in the same year to become the first professional football league in the Caribbean. The eight inaugural members were Defence Force, Doc&#x27;s Khelwalaas, FUTGOF, Joe Public, Point Fortin Civic, Police, San Juan Jabloteh, and W Connection. In the first professional season, Defence Force continued a theme set during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, which saw the club win a record twentieth league championship.

The Professional Football League would continue for two more seasons before a decision from its owner and founder, Jack Warner, to withdraw funding for the league. Early league results suggested an improvement in player development with several domestic professionals named to starting roles in the national team. Consequently, club owners agreed in March 2012 to develop a new professional league that would operate rather as a corporation, known as the &quot;T&amp;T Pro League Limited&quot;, owned by the member clubs and a continuation of the Professional Football League. One month later, the TT Pro League began with eight members: Arima Fire, Caledonia AIA, Defence Force, Joe Public, North East Stars, San Juan Jabloteh, South Starworld Strikers, and defending champions W Connection.

After establishing itself on the talents of homegrown players during its initial years, the league continued to see several of its stars move to leagues in Europe and North America. Collin Samuel was the first to leave when he signed for Falkirk in August 2002, and was joined at Dundee United a year later by Jason Scotland. Kenwyne Jones, former standout for Joe Public and W Connection, signed with Southampton, whereas Cornell Glen of San Juan Jabloteh joined the MetroStars of Major League Soccer during the 2004 season. The departures ultimately benefited the Pro League as the national team, composed of several current and former Pro League players, qualified for the nation&#x27;s first FIFA World Cup in November 2005.

In the build-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, community interest in local football was at an all-time high and the Pro League garnered praise for its development of homegrown professional footballers. As a result, the league implemented a series of marketing plans to establish itself as a viable professional league. Two major initiatives were to increase league membership back to ten teams and establish a reserve league in 2007 for players that were previously on the bench during league matches to have a league of their own to show scouts their skills on the field.

===Recent years (2009–present)===
After the league&#x27;s first decade, the TT Pro League has taken steps to internationalise the league in an effort to raise the level of its competition. One of the first moves in this regard was to align its calendar with those of major football leagues around the world. Prior to 2011, the Pro League operated on a spring-to-fall format which caused several conflicts with the FIFA calendar. Consequently, many of the league&#x27;s top players abandoned their Pro League clubs during June and July to compete in international competitions, which made it difficult for the league to attract supporters for its matches. The schedule change has provided several players greater transfer opportunities to more prominent leagues. The second move was to expand club rosters from 25 to 35 players to provide clubs flexibility during the prolonged calendar featuring three rounds of league competition, five domestic cup competitions, CFU Club Championship, and the CONCACAF Champions League.

The Pro League has also started to market itself on the talents of its Trinidad and Tobago players, both experienced and young talents. Beginning in 2009, the league witnessed a return of several former national team stars, including Stern John, Russell Latapy, Dennis Lawrence, and Dwight Yorke. Several more Pro League players have made a significant impact on the league after spending a majority of their career on the twin-island Republic. In the 2009 season, Arnold Dwarika of United Petrotrin became the first Trinidadian player to score 100 Pro League goals. Moreover, breakout stars such as Keon Daniel, Cornell Glen, Kevin Molino, and Lester Peltier began making names for themselves in the Pro League before starring for the &quot;Soca Warriors&quot; and securing transfers to Asia, Europe, and North America. This exchange of top prospects for veterans to the Pro League signifies an increased international awareness and potential for popularity.

==Corporate structure==
The TT Pro League is operated as a corporation and is owned by the ten member clubs known as &quot;T&amp;T Pro League Limited&quot;. The board of directors, consisting of a representative from each club, sets out the policy to oversee league operations and selects a neutral chairman and CEO. The chairman is elected by the board and cannot be associated with any of its member teams. In addition, the operational aspect of the league is carried out by a management team led by the CEO. The office employs marketing, public relations, media, accounting, and administrative staff. The Trinidad and Tobago Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Pro League, but has veto power during the elections of the chairman and chief executive officer, and when new rules are adopted by the league.

Each Pro League club is required to have a board of directors, chairman, chief executive officer, administrator, manager and an assistant, marketing and public relations manager, equipment manager, physiotherapist, and a youth development officer. In addition, clubs are also required to have a dedicated home venue, which is secure allowing for the collection of gate receipts and with a good playing surface. The size of the playing field must meet international standards and must be approved by the league&#x27;s technical committee. As part of each club&#x27;s financial stability off the field, clubs must submit a marketing plan that illustrates how the club will generate financial and physical support to meet monthly commitments.

Having started on such a corporate structure, the league has recently taken several steps to establish itself as one of the premier leagues in CONCACAF. Upon creation, the league&#x27;s first goal was to establish better crowd attendances for its matches. With the construction of several football stadiums during the first few years of its development, the league created a foundation of fan support. More recently, the league has now set a new mission to create more local talent and make the players not just available for the Trinidad and Tobago audience, but for the world.

==Competition format==
===League competition===
There are twelve clubs in the TT Premier Football League. During the course of a league season (from September to May) each team competes against every other team twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. In the last nine matches of the regular season each team competes against every other team at neutral venues for a total of 27 games. Each match sees the winning team awarded three points, or in the case of a draw, the teams receive one point each. No points are awarded for a loss. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference, followed by total goals scored, and then by head-to-head records between tying teams determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. There is no automatic promotion and relegation between the Pro League and National Super League, the second-level in the Trinidad and Tobago football league system. Club members of the Pro League vote to determine which, if any, applications for admission into the league will be permitted with preference given to the Super League champion.

===Cup competitions===
The TT Pro League organises five knock-out cup competitions each league season: the League Cup (commonly called the &quot;First Citizens Cup&quot;), the &quot;Digicel Pro Bowl&quot;, the &quot;TOYOTA Classic&quot;, the Goal Shield (or for sponsorship reasons, the &quot;Lucozade Sport Goal Shield&quot;), and the TTPFL Knockout Cup, which was established in 2023. The League Cup and Pro Bowl, established in 2000 and 2004, respectively, are cup competitions open exclusively to Pro League clubs. The Pro League agreed to create another knock-out cup competition in 2009 for its clubs named the &quot;Goal Shield&quot; with a unique prize system. The Classic, established in 2005, comprises a sixteen club knock-out competition open to all teams in the Pro League, with remaining positions filled by teams from the National Super League. In addition, Pro League clubs also compete in the annual FA Trophy organised by and named after the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association. The knockout tournament is the oldest football competition in Trinidad and Tobago, dating back to 1927, and is open to all clubs affiliated with the Football Association.

The league introduced in 2012, the Charity Shield to mark the start of each TT Pro League season. The Charity Shield contests the winners of the previous year&#x27;s Pro Bowl and the champions of the Pro League. In the case that the league champion also is the holder of the Pro Bowl, then the top two teams in the previous league season compete for the Charity Shield. Generally regarded as below the FA Trophy and First Citizens Cup in terms of importance, the fixture is a recognised football Super Cup. The TTPFL Knockout Cup was introduced in the 2023 season which includes teams from the TT Premier Football League and TT Super League.

===Continental qualification===
Beginning with the 2006 season, qualification changed to allow the Pro League two automatic berths into the CFU Club Championship. In order to qualify for the annual subcontinental tournament, Pro League teams need to finish the previous league season either as champion or runners-up. Both teams enter the competition in the first round, which comprises a single round-robin with each group winner advancing to the final round. Since the inception of the CFU Club Championship, the winner of the competition has qualified for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. However, with the formation and restructure of the Champions&#x27; Cup into the Champions League in 2008–09, the Caribbean gained two qualification places. Consequently, the top three Caribbean clubs in the annual Club Championship earn qualification into the Champions League. In the case any Caribbean club is precluded, it is supplanted by the fourth-place finisher from the Club Championship.

During its first four seasons, the top three Caribbean clubs entered the Champions League in a preliminary round and with a win from the two-legged knockout tie entered the sixteen-team group stage (four groups of four), then followed by an eight-team home-and-away single elimination tournament. However, CONCACAF announced a new format beginning with its 2012–13 Champions League. Under the new format, all teams begin play in the group stage (eight groups of three), which includes each year&#x27;s top three Caribbean finishers.

==Sponsorship==
The TT Pro League has been sponsored under its current format under various title sponsors. The sponsor has been able to determine the league&#x27;s sponsorship name. The list below details who the sponsors have been and what they called the competition:

* 1999: Craven A (&quot;Craven A Professional Football League&quot;)
* 2000–2009: No sponsor (&quot;Professional Football League&quot; (until 2001) then &quot;TT Pro League&quot;)
* 2009–2017: Digicel (&quot;Digicel Pro League&quot;)

As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Pro League has a number of official partners and suppliers. These partners include companies involved in car dealership, financial services, food and beverage, sports-wear and equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

==Finances==
The TT Pro League has faced major obstacles towards its sustainability and viability as a professional football league within the Caribbean since its inception. Among the main issues that ail many Pro League clubs, apart from insufficient sponsorship, is the lack of community football grounds. Although the country has five football stadiums, which were constructed to stage the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship, none of which are located within a club&#x27;s respective community and are owned by the Ministry of Sport. Consequently, clubs have found it difficult to obtain a significant portion of gate receipts from their home matches. Several clubs have voiced their displeasure in playing home matches in various stadiums around the country and feel that having home grounds within their respective communities is a key to their financial viability.
Clubs have also encountered problems in lack of merchandising and television revenue. In fact, a majority of Pro League clubs fail to have a marketing plan and a lack presence within their respective communities, which has significantly impacted crowd attendances and ability for clubs to earn sufficient revenue. Consequently, the league has witnessed a high team turnover with seven clubs suspending their football operations and withdrawing from the Pro League during a four-year period, citing financial difficulties and inability to secure long-term sponsors.

In order to off-set the lack of revenue from match attendances, clubs may be sponsored by national and international companies.
The first club to secure a corporate sponsor was San Juan Jabloteh when the club signed an agreement with CL Financial. As a result, the club used its sponsorship to significantly expand its operations from a youth organisation into a professional football club. Several more Pro League clubs have agreed to title sponsorships to provide each club financial stability. The most prominent title sponsor agreement occurred when W Connection ended their partnership with Vibe CT 105.1 FM in favour of an undisclosed deal with DirecTV in 2012.
In addition, clubs may also sell ad space on the front of their shirts, following the practice of international sport, specifically association football. There are currently seven clubs that have signed sponsorship deals to have company logos placed on the front of their shirts. The most lucrative shirt sponsorship occurred when St. Ann&#x27;s Rangers announced a six-year agreement with PlusOne Fashion of the United States to supply training, travel, and match-day shirts valuing US$75,000 for each season of the six-year deal.

==Clubs==
A total of 22 distinct clubs have played in the TT Premier Football League from its inception in 1999, but only six teams have won the league title. Two teams have also been members of the league every season since its inception (Defence Force F.C. and W Connection F.C.). Among the current ten clubs, eight (Club Sando F.C, Defence Force F.C, Morvant Caledonia United, Point Fortin Civic F.C, Police F.C, San Juan Jabloteh F.C, St. Ann&#x27;s Rangers F.C, and W Connection F.C.) existed before the TT Premier Football League was formed. In October 2023, FC Phoenix was approved by the TTPFL and became the first Tobago based club, since the now defunct Tobago United did in the former TT Pro League, to compete in the league. For a list of league champions, club expansion and contraction, and top scorers for each season, see List of TT Pro League seasons.

Twelve out of the thirteen clubs competed in the TT Premier Football League during the 2024–25 season:

===Honoured clubs===
The TT Premier Football League follows the practice of association football in honouring clubs that have won multiple championships or other honours by the display of a representative golden star above the honoured club&#x27;s badge. Each country&#x27;s usage is unique and in Trinidad and Tobago the practice is to award one star for each of the following achievements:

* Winners of at least ten championship titles in Trinidad and Tobago,
* Winners of the CFU Club Championship (1997–2022),
* Winners of the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup (1962–2008) or CONCACAF Champions League (2008–2023).

The following clubs have gold stars featured while playing in the TT Premier Football League and international competition.

Defence Force F.C. is currently the lone TT Premier Football League club to place gold stars above their badge during domestic and international competitions. The &quot;Teteron Boys&quot; were awarded their first star in 1978 after winning the 1978 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. Their most recent star was earned after winning the 2001 CFU Club Championship in 2001. Although, Morvant Caledonia United, Joe Public F.C, San Juan Jabloteh F.C, United Petrotrin F.C, and W Connection F.C. have won the Caribbean Club Championship, the clubs&#x27; badges have not featured gold stars.

==Stadiums==
Until the early 1980s, the national team held its home matches in Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, generally thought of as the most picturesque and largest of the old cricket grounds in the West Indies. The cricket ground is the country&#x27;s oldest stadium and served as host to domestic football league matches for Defence Force and San Juan Jabloteh during the league&#x27;s inaugural season. After renovation in preparation of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the capacity of the ground rose to 20,000 seats.

In 1996, Marvin Lee Stadium was built in Macoya and is housed together with the Dr. João Havelange Centre of Excellence. The stadium served as the home to former member of the Pro League, Joe Public, and holds approximately 6,000. In 2005, Jack Warner proposed that Marvin Lee Stadium install an artificial playing surface, citing that it would bring more credibility to the region. Two years later, through a developmental grant from FIFA, Joe Public became the first Caribbean club to install astroturf, reportedly costing in excess of TT$8 million. Low-profile games, such as international friendlies against other islands in the Caribbean, are also played at the stadium.

However, it was not until 2001, with Trinidad and Tobago awarded the FIFA U-17 World Championship, that four additional football stadiums were constructed for the event – Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva, Larry Gomes Stadium in Malabar, Manny Ramjohn Stadium in Marabella, and Dwight Yorke Stadium in Bacolet. In addition, the National Stadium, renamed in honour of Hasely Crawford, underwent major renovation for the competition and expanded capacity to 27,000 to become the largest stadium in the country. The stadium would stage a semi-final, third place, and final matches during the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship.

Shortly after the international tournament, several TT Pro League clubs moved into the newly constructed football stadiums. Defence Force, Police, San Juan Jabloteh, and St. Ann&#x27;s Rangers moved into the renovated Hasely Crawford Stadium, Arima Fire relocated from Arima Municipal Stadium into Larry Gomes Stadium, and Manny Ramjohn Stadium served as the new venue for W Connection. Expansion club South Starworld Strikers played host to league matches in Ato Boldon Stadium. The stadium now is the home to Central FC following the withdrawal of the Strikers from the league in 2006. Through the admission of Tobago United into the league for the 2003–04 season, the &quot;Tobago Boys&quot; played their home games in Dwight Yorke Stadium until they withdrew from the league in 2010. With the additions of the Mahaica Oval Pavilion, Palo Seco Velodrome, and Sangre Grande Regional Complex, home of Point Fortin Civic, former club United Petrotrin, and North East Stars, respectively, Pro League teams have played in sixteen football stadiums.

==Managers==
Managers in the TT Pro League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans. Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Occasionally caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker.

The league&#x27;s longest-serving manager was Jamaal Shabazz, who was in charge of Morvant Caledonia United from April 2000 until he agreed to become the Trinidad and Tobago national team co-manager in November 2012 (12 years and 236 days). Stuart Charles-Fevrier is now the Pro League&#x27;s longest-serving current manager having been in charge of the &quot;Savonetta Boys&quot; of W Connection since June 2004.

There have been eight managers that have won the Pro League. In addition, four foreign managers have secured the Pro League championship, which comprise two English (Terry Fenwick, San Juan Jabloteh, three wins, and Ricky Hill, San Juan Jabloteh, one win), a Guyanese (James McLean, North East Stars, one win), and a Saint Lucian (Stuart Charles-Fevrier, W Connection, five wins). Michael McComie became the second Trinidad and Tobago manager to win the league, when he won the title with Joe Public in 2006. Derek King later became the third Trinidad and Tobago manager to claim the league title in 2009, also with Joe Public. In fact, King became the youngest manager to win the league title at 29 years, 198 days. The current managers in the Pro League are:

==Players==

===Foreign players and transfer regulations===
TT Pro League clubs have almost complete freedom to sign whatever number and category of players they wish. There is no team or individual salary cap, no age restrictions other than those applied by general employment law, and no restrictions on the overall number of foreign players or nationalities. However, players can only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the TT Pro League. The two current transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 15 September and between 15 December and 15 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence, usually on an emergency basis. In addition, Pro League clubs cannot sign free agents at any stage of the Pro League season outside of transfer windows.

The Pro League has been growing in popularity within the Caribbean and expanding across the Americas. In particular, over 200 foreign players have competed in the league, and with Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s inclusion in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Pro League was represented for the first time with Cyd Gray, Aurtis Whitley, Anthony Wolfe (all of San Juan Jabloteh), and David Atiba Charles (W Connection). Furthermore, two foreign players have claimed the &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award in league history. Charles Pollard (Guyana) won the award in 2003–04 while playing for North East Stars, while Gefferson (Brazil) claimed the honour in 2005 with W Connection.

;Notable foreign players
&quot;This list of foreign players includes those who received international caps while playing for a TT Pro League club, made significant contributions to a TT Pro League club in terms of appearances or goals, and/or who made significant contributions to the sport either before they played for a TT Pro League club, or after they left. It is clearly not yet complete and all inclusive, and additions and refinements will continue to be made over time.&quot;

===Player wages and transfer records===
There is no team or individual salary cap in the TT Pro League. However, with the league&#x27;s founding in 1999, the Pro League established a minimum player salary of TT$18,000 per year. As of the 2013–14 season, the average Pro League player wage was between TT$30,000 to TT$50,000 per year; with top players earning up to TT$90,000, which is significantly lower than average salaries in the United States&#x27; Major League Soccer (TT$1,032,671) or Football League Two, the fourth tier of English football (TT$419,182). Although individual player salaries are undisclosed, one known player&#x27;s salary became available with the 4 May 2012 publication of ESPN The Magazine. The magazine stated that Shandel Samuel was the highest earning Vincentian athlete in 2011 with a salary of TT$40,000 while playing for Ma Pau.

There are few examples of player transfer fees agreed upon between Pro League clubs in the domestic competition for a player to switch teams. One of the first transfers involving a Pro League player occurred when Carlos Edwards signed with Wrexham of the Football League for £250,000 in 2000. A year later, Dennis Lawrence joined Edwards at the Welsh club for £100,000 from Defence Force. In 2004, in a common practice with Pro League player transfers, Kenwyne Jones was sold to Southampton of the English Premier League for a nominal fee, reported to be £100,000, with the Pro League club claiming an additional sell-on clause. After Jones was sold to Sunderland of the Premier League in 2007 for £6 million, the &quot;Savonetta Boys&quot; secured a percentage of the transfer fee in the region of US$1 million.

===Top scorers===

Following each TT Pro League season, the Golden Boot is awarded to the league&#x27;s top goal scorer. Defence Force and Trinidad and Tobago international, Devorn Jorsling, holds the record for the most Pro League goals with 144, following the 2015–16 season. Jorsling has finished among the top ten goal scorers in eight of the previous nine seasons in the Pro League.

Since the first Pro League season in 1999, 14 different players from seven different clubs have won or shared the top scorers title. Devorn Jorsling became the first player to claim the Golden Boot on four occasions, after scoring the most goals in the 2008, 2010–11, 2012–13, and 2014–15 seasons. However, complete statistics and goal scoring records are unknown for the 1999 through 2003–04 seasons. Arnold Dwarika holds the record for most goals in a season (45) – for Joe Public. Dwarika&#x27;s record came in the 1999 season, which consisted of 28 games. The first foreign player to claim the Golden Boot was Guyanese international Randolph Jerome of North East Stars who finished with 28 goals in 2003–04. Since then, four more foreign players have finished as the league&#x27;s top scorer. Gefferson (Brazil) and Earl Jean (Saint Lucia) shared the title in 2005 with 14 goals each. Other foreign players to win include Roen Nelson (Jamaica) in 2007 and Peter Byers (Antigua and Barbuda) in 2008.

The highest-scoring match to date in the Pro League occurred on 13 October 2004 when W Connection defeated Tobago United 17–0. In fact, Saint Lucian Titus Elva scored nine goals in the match and is currently the holder of the Pro League single game scoring record. Devorn Jorsling has the honour of achieving the most Pro League hat-tricks with nine. Former Joe Public, North East Stars, and current San Juan Jabloteh winger Kerry Baptiste has scored three or more goals on eight occasions. In addition, Baptiste, Elva, and Nixon are tied for the most league matches with four or more goals (a beaver-trick) with two.

==Awards==
===Player and manager awards===
In addition to the winner&#x27;s trophy and the individual winner&#x27;s medals awarded to players, the TT Pro League also awards a number of position players and goalkeepers for their contributions to their club at the conclusion of each league season. The &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award is given to the most outstanding player of the previous season. To date five players to win the award have also guided their respective clubs to a league championship in the same season. In addition, the league also awards the best position players including the best goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, and forward of the year.

The league also names the &quot;Manager of the Year&quot; award given to the top manager of each Pro League season. The title has been awarded to four foreign managers, which comprises two English (Ricky Hill, San Juan Jabloteh, and Terry Fenwick, San Juan Jabloteh), a Guyanese (James McLean, North East Stars), and a Saint Lucian (Stuart Charles-Fevrier, W Connection). On five occasions the award was given to the manager that led his club to a league championship. Most recently, Derek King became the third Trinidad and Tobago manager to claim the award with Joe Public. King became the youngest manager to win the award at 29 years, 198 days. Beginning in the 2012–13 season, the Pro League re-instituted the &quot;Manager&quot; and &quot;Player of the Month&quot; awards given to recognise the best adjudged Pro League manager and player during each month of the league season. The recipient is selected based on points accumulated from coaches, match commissioners, and the media.

==International performance==
TT Pro League clubs have competed in international competitions organised through CONCACAF since 1999, when Joe Public qualified for the Champions&#x27; Cup. However, the &quot;Eastern Lions&quot; qualified for the competition as a member of the Semi-Professional League the previous season. After its inaugural season, the first Pro League representatives (Defence Force and W Connection) qualified based on final league position for the 2000 CFU Club Championship. Additionally, Joe Public entered the competition as the competition holders, eventually repeating as winners to qualify for the 2000 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

Although Pro League clubs have never won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup (later renamed the &quot;Champions League&quot;), clubs have experienced success in its qualification tournament for Caribbean clubs. In fact, Pro League clubs have won the CFU Club Championship on nine occasions with an additional nine runners-up finishes — the most among any Caribbean football league. The &quot;Savonetta Boys&quot; of W Connection have enjoyed the most success having been finalists on nine occasions including three wins, which represents the most among Caribbean clubs.

Based on results during the previous calendar year, the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS) has the Pro League currently ranked 135th in the world and 12th in CONCACAF. In addition, according to IFFHS in 2013, the highest ranked Pro League club in CONCACAF is W Connection in 56th followed by San Juan Jabloteh in 68th.

<text>Sir Ernst Hans Josef Gombrich (; ; 30 March 1909 – 3 November 2001) was an Austrian-born art historian who, after settling in England in 1936, became a naturalised British citizen in 1947 and spent most of his working life in the United Kingdom.

Gombrich was the author of many works of cultural history and art history, most notably &quot;The Story of Art&quot;, a book widely regarded as one of the most accessible introductions to the visual arts, and &quot;Art and Illusion&quot;, a major work in the psychology of perception that influenced thinkers as diverse as Carlo Ginzburg, Nelson Goodman, Umberto Eco, and Thomas Kuhn.

== Biography ==
The son of Karl Gombrich and Leonie Hock, Gombrich was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, into an assimilated upper middle class family of Jewish origin who were part of a sophisticated social and musical milieu. His father was a lawyer and former classmate of Hugo von Hofmannsthal and his mother was a distinguished pianist who graduated from the Vienna Conservatoire with the School&#x27;s Medal of Distinction. 

At the Conservatoire she was a pupil of, amongst others, Anton Bruckner. However, rather than follow a career as a concert pianist (which would have been difficult to combine with her family life in this period) she became an assistant of Theodor Leschetizky. She also knew Arnold Schoenberg, Gustav Mahler, Hugo Wolf and Johannes Brahms. 

Rudolf Serkin was a close family friend. Adolf Busch and members of the Busch Quartet regularly met and played in the family home. Throughout his life Gombrich maintained a deep love and knowledge of classical music. He was a competent cellist and in later life at home in London regularly played the chamber music of Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven and others with his wife and his elder sister Dea Forsdyke, a concert violinist.

Gombrich was educated at the Theresianum and at the University of Vienna, where he studied art history under Hans Tietze, , Julius von Schlosser and Josef Strzygowski, completing a PhD thesis on the Mannerist architecture of Giulio Romano, supervised by Von Schlosser. Specialised in caricature, he was invited to help Ernst Kris, who was then keeper of decorative arts at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, on his graduating in 1933. 

In 1936, he married Ilse Heller (1910–2006), a pupil of his mother, and herself an accomplished pianist. Their only child, the Indologist Richard Gombrich, was born in 1937. They had two grandchildren: the educationalist Carl Gombrich, (b. 1965) and Leonie Gombrich (b. 1966), who is his literary executor.

After publishing his first book &quot;A Little History of the World&quot; in German in 1936, written for children and adolescents, and seeing it become a hit only to be banned by the Nazis for pacifism, he fled to Britain in 1936 to take up a post as a research assistant at the Warburg Institute, University of London.

During World War II, Gombrich worked for the BBC World Service, monitoring German radio broadcasts. When in 1945 an upcoming announcement was prefaced by the Adagio of Bruckner&#x27;s seventh symphony, written for Richard Wagner&#x27;s death, Gombrich guessed correctly that Adolf Hitler was dead and promptly broke the news to Churchill.

Gombrich returned to the Warburg Institute in November 1945, where he became Senior Research Fellow (1946), Lecturer (1948), Reader (1954), and eventually Professor of the History of the Classical Tradition and director of the institute (1959–76). He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1960, appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1966 New Year Honours, knighted in the 1972 Birthday Honours, and appointed a member of the Order of Merit in 1988. He continued his work at the University of London until close to his death in 2001. He was the recipient of numerous additional honours, including Goethe Prize 1994 and Balzan Prize in 1985 for History of Western Art.

Gombrich was close to a number of Austrian &quot;émigrés&quot; who fled to the West prior to the Anschluss, among them Karl Popper (to whom he was especially close), Friedrich Hayek and Max Perutz. He was instrumental in bringing to publication Popper&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;. Each had known the other only fleetingly in Vienna, as Gombrich&#x27;s father served his law apprenticeship with Popper&#x27;s father. They became lifelong friends in exile.

== Work ==
Gombrich remarked that he had two very different publics: amongst scholars he was known particularly for his work on the Renaissance and the psychology of perception, but also his thoughts on cultural history and tradition; to a wider, non-specialist audience he was known for the accessibility and immediacy of his writing and his ability to present scholarly work in a clear and unfussy manner.

Gombrich&#x27;s first book, and the only one he did not write in English, was &quot;Eine kurze Weltgeschichte für junge Leser&quot; (&quot;A short history of the world for young readers&quot;), published in Germany in 1936. It was very popular and translated into several languages, but was not available in English until 2005, when a translation of a revised edition was published as &quot;A Little History of the World&quot;. He did most of this translation and revision himself, and it was completed by his long-time assistant and secretary Caroline Mustill and his granddaughter Leonie Gombrich after his death.

&quot;The Story of Art&quot;, first published in 1950 and currently in its 16th edition, is widely regarded as one of the most accessible introductions to the history of visual arts. Originally intended for adolescent readers, it has sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 30 languages.

Other major publications include &quot;Art and Illusion&quot; (1960), regarded by critics to be his most influential and far-reaching work, and the essays gathered in &quot;Meditations on a Hobby Horse&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Image and the Eye&quot; (1981). Other important books are &quot;Aby Warburg: An Intellectual Biography&quot; (1970), &quot;The Sense of Order&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Preference for the Primitive&quot; (posthumously in 2002). The complete list of his publications, &quot;E. H. Gombrich: A Bibliography&quot;, was published by Joseph Burney Trapp in 2000.

== Thought ==
=== Psychology of perception ===
When Gombrich arrived in England in 1936, the discipline of art history was largely centred around connoisseurship. Gombrich, however, had been brought up in the Viennese culture of &quot;Bildung&quot; and was concerned with wider issues of cultural tradition and the relationship between science and art. This latter breadth of interest can be seen both in his working relationship with the Austrian psychoanalyst and art historian, Ernst Kris, concerning the art of caricature and his later books, &quot;The Sense of Order&quot; (1979) (in which information theory is discussed in its relation to patterns and ornaments in art) and the classic &quot;Art and Illusion&quot; (1960).

It was in &quot;Art and Illusion&quot; that he introduced the ideas of &#x27;schemata&#x27;, &#x27;making and matching&#x27;, &#x27;correction&#x27; and &#x27;trial and error&#x27; influenced by &#x27;conjecture and refutation&#x27;, in Popper&#x27;s philosophy of science. In Gombrich&#x27;s view, the artist compares what he has drawn or painted with what he is trying to draw/paint, and by a &#x27;feedback loop&#x27; gradually corrects the drawing/painting to look more like what he is seeing. The process does not start from scratch, however. Each artist inherits &#x27;&quot;schemata&quot; that designate reality by force of convention&#x27;. These schemata, plus the techniques and works of previous masters, are the starting points from which the artist begins her own process of trial and error.

:&quot;This [Popperian description of conjecture and refutation, trial and error] is eminently applicable to the story of visual discoveries in art. Our formula of schema and correction, in fact, illustrates this very procedure. You must have a starting point, a standard of comparison, to begin that process of making and matching and remaking which finally becomes embodied in the finished image. The artist cannot start from scratch, but he can criticise his forerunners&quot;

The philosophical conceptions developed by Popper for a philosophy of science meshed well with Gombrich&#x27;s ideas for a more robust explanation of the history of art. Gombrich had written his first major work &quot;The Story of Art&quot; in 1950, ten years before &quot;Art and Illusion&quot;. The earlier book has been described as viewing the history of art as a narrative moving &#x27;from what ancient artists &quot;knew&quot; to what later artists &quot;saw&quot;&#x27;. And as Gombrich was always more concerned with the individual rather than mass movements (the famous first line of &quot;The Story of Art&quot; is &#x27;There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists&#x27;), he saw the use of scientific and psychological explanations as key to understanding how these individual artists &#x27;saw&#x27;, and how they built upon the traditions they had inherited and of which they were a part. With the dialectics of making and matching, schema and correction, Gombrich sought to ground artistic development on more universal truths, closer to those of science, than on what he regarded as fashionable or vacuous terms such as &#x27;zeitgeist&#x27; and other &#x27;abstractions&#x27;.

=== Renaissance studies ===
Gombrich&#x27;s contribution to the study of Renaissance art began with his doctoral dissertation on mannerism. In this he argues that the work of Giulio Romano, at the Palazzo del Tè, was not the work of a decadent Renaissance artist but rather showed how the painter responded to the demands of a patron &#x27;eager for fashionable novelty&#x27;.

The four-volume series &quot;Studies in the Art of the Renaissance&quot; (1966) comprises the volumes &quot;Norm and Form&quot;; &quot;Symbolic Images&quot;; &quot;The Heritage of Apelles&quot;; and &quot;New Light on Old Masters&quot;, and made a major contribution to the study of symbolism in the work of this period.

Gombrich was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci and wrote extensively on him, both in these volumes and elsewhere.

== Influence ==
Gombrich has been called &#x27;the best known art historian in Britain, perhaps in the world&#x27; and also &#x27;one of the most influential scholars and thinkers of the 20th century&#x27;.

In October 2014 an English Heritage blue plaque for Gombrich was unveiled by sculptor Antony Gormley at 19 Briardale Gardens, Hampstead, alongside Sir Peter Bazalgette, chair of the Arts Council and blue plaque panel member, Richard Gombrich and the art historian Prof David Freedberg. The plaque reads: &quot;E. H. Gombrich (1909 – 2001) Art Historian lived here 1952 to 2001.&quot; Gormley lived as a child a couple of doors down from the house.

== Criticism ==
Gombrich was sensitive to the criticism that he did not like modern art and was obliged to defend his position on occasion. He has also been criticised for taking what is now viewed as a eurocentric—not to say neo-colonialist—view of art, and for not including female artists in much of his writing on Western art. His answer to the latter was that he was writing a history of art as it was, and that women artists did not feature widely in the West before the 20th century. He admired 20th-century female artists such as Bridget Riley, whose work was included in a revised edition of &quot;The Story of Art&quot;.

While several works of Gombrich (especially &quot;Art and Illusion&quot; in 1960) had enormous impact on art history and other fields, his categorical attacks on historism have been accused (by Carlo Ginzburg) of leading to &quot;barren&quot; scholarship; many of his methodological arguments have been superseded by the work of art historians like Svetlana Alpers and Michael Baxandall.

<text>The Liri (Latin Liris or Lyris, previously, Clanis; Greek: ) is one of the principal rivers of central Italy, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea a little below Minturno under the name Garigliano.

== Source and route ==
The Liri&#x27;s source is in the Monte Camiciola, elevation , in the Monti Simbruini of central Apennines (Abruzzo, &quot;comune&quot; of Cappadocia). It flows at first in a southeasterly direction through a long trough-like valley, parallel to the general direction of the Apennines, until it reaches the city of Sora.
In the upper part of Isola del Liri it receives the waters of Fibreno and then it divides into two branches which then rejoin, surrounding the lower part of the town (&quot;Isola del Liri&quot; stands for &quot;Liri Island&quot;). One branch makes a high waterfall situated in the centre, a unique case in Europe.

A dam is built on the river after the confluence with the Sacco at Ceprano. The last important Liri&#x27;s tributary is the Melfa, with which it joins near Aquino. After Cassino it receives the waters of the Gari, and afterwards it is known as Garigliano.

The Liri-Garigliano system has a total water drainage basin of .

==History==
Both Strabo and Pliny tell us that it was originally called Clanis, a name which appears to have been common to many Italian rivers (see for ex. Clanio and Lagni); the former writer erroneously assigns its sources to the country of the Vestini; an opinion which is adopted also by Lucan. The surrounding area was devastated by Hannibal during his invasion in response to the locals&#x27; having burnt the bridges over the river. In 238 BC, the adjacent city of Fregella was the site of a crushed rebellion against Roman rule. The Liris is noticed by several of the Roman poets, as a very gentle and tranquil stream, a character which it well deserves in the lower part of its course, where it was described by a nineteenth century traveller as a wide and noble river, winding under the shadow of poplars through a lovely vale, and then gliding gently towards the sea.

At the mouth of the Liris near Minturnae, was an extensive sacred grove consecrated to Marica, a nymph or local divinity, who was represented by a tradition, adopted by Virgil, as mother of Latinus, while others identified her with Circe. Her grove and temple were not only objects of great veneration to the people of the neighboring town of Minturnae, but appear to have enjoyed considerable celebrity with the Romans themselves. Immediately adjoining its mouth was an extensive marsh, formed probably by the stagnation of the river itself, and celebrated in history in connection with the adventures of Gaius Marius.

About upstream from its mouth, the river passes what used to be Lake Fucino, separated from the lake basin by the mountain ridge of &quot;Monte Salviano&quot;. The Roman emperor Claudius had a tunnel dug through the ridge in an attempt to drain the lake, which had no natural outlet, to the Liri. The later emperor Hadrian tried to improve the tunnel but, after the fall of the empire, tunnel maintenance was not maintained and it was blocked by silt and debris, allowing the lake to refill. A new tunnel was completed in the 1860s, and the basin of the former lake still drains to the Liri via that tunnel, through the ridge near the town of Avezzano. The river, in most tracts, matched the longest lived border in Europe from the 6th century a.d when it separated the Byzantine exclave of the duchy of Rome from the Lombard duchy of Benevento until 1860-61: the year of unification of Italy when the Papal states and the kingdom of the two Sicilies were the last sovereign countries to share this border.

During the Italian Campaign of the Second World War, the German defenses of the Gustav Line followed the Liri valley.

<text>The 41st Division was an infantry division of the British Army, raised during the First World War as part of Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies. The division saw service on the Western Front and later on the Italian Front.

== Formation history ==
The division was formed as part of the fifth wave (K5) of divisions in the New Army; it did not have a regional title, but was composed primarily of recruits from the south of England. Several of its battalions had been raised by local communities and were named for their towns or industries. After training and home service, the 41st Division, commanded by Major-General Sydney Lawford, deployed overseas to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front in the first week of May 1916; its first major combat came in September of that year, at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, part of the larger Battle of the Somme.
After fighting in 1917 at the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) it was transferred with four other divisions to the Italian Front. It remained here for three months throughout the winter of 1917–18 before returning to the Western Front, where it arrived just before the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in March. It participated in the Allied &quot;Hundred Days Offensive&quot; and ended the war in Flanders, from where it moved to join the Army of Occupation in Germany, following the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

The 41st Division was commanded by Major-General Lawford throughout its existence and was demobilised in March 1919, with some units transferred to the 47th (1/2nd London) Division, British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).

<text>South Starworld Strikers Football Club was a professional football team, which played in Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s Professional Football League. The club played their home matches in Ato Boldon Stadium, in Couva, Trinidad.

==History==
The team joined the TT Pro League beginning in the 2002 season, having previously played in Trinidad&#x27;s Southern Football Association. They joined the league with the explicit intention of representing the south of Trinidad, previously underrepresented in football circles.

The club finished its first season with a 4 wins, 10 ties, and 14 losses. They improved significantly in their second season, however, going 17–7–12 and finishing fourth in the league. They maintained a similar standing in 2004, again finishing fourth, this time with a 10–6–5 record. In 2005, they did not compete because of financial difficulties, but they were back again in the 2006 season.</text><links>

<text>Charles Edward Montague (1 January 1867 – 28 May 1928) was an English journalist, known also as a writer of novels and essays.

==Biography==
Montague was born and brought up in London, the son of an Irish Roman Catholic priest who had left his vocation to marry. He was educated at the City of London School and Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford he gained a First in Classical Moderations (1887) and a Second in Literae Humaniores (1889). Montague also played rugby at Oxford and was a member of the Oxford rowing team. Montague also received a Bronze Medal from the Royal Humane Society for saving a man from drowning. In 1890 he was recruited by C. P. Scott to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, where he became a leader writer and critic; while Scott was an M.P. between 1895 and 1906 he was &quot;de facto&quot; editor of the paper. He married Scott&#x27;s daughter Madeline in 1898. While working at the paper, Montague became a supporter of Irish Home Rule. Montague&#x27;s journalism caused some controversy due to his opposition to the Anglo-Boer War. During this time, Montague wrote &quot;William Thomas Arnold&quot; (1907), a biography of the titular journalist, with Mary Augusta Ward. Montague also produced his first novel, &quot;A Hind Let Loose&quot; (1910), a humorous novel set in the provincial newspaper business.

Montague was against World War I prior to its commencement, but once it started he believed that it was right to support it in the hope of a swift resolution. In 1914, Montague was 47, which was well over the age for enlistment. But in order to enlist, he dyed his white hair black to enable him to fool the Army into accepting him. H. W. Nevinson would later write that &quot;Montague is the only man I know whose white hair in a single night turned dark through courage.&quot; He began as a grenadier-sergeant, and rose to lieutenant and then captain of intelligence in 1915. Later in the war, he became an armed escort for VIPs visiting the battlefield. He escorted such personalities as H. G. Wells and Bernard Shaw. After the end of World War I he wrote in a strong anti-war vein. He wrote that &quot;War hath no fury like a non-combatant.&quot; &quot;Disenchantment&quot; (1922), a collection of newspaper articles about the war, was one of the first prose works to strongly criticise the way the war was fought, and is regarded by some as a pivotal text in the development of literature about World War I. &quot;Disenchantment&quot; criticised the British Press&#x27; coverage of the war and the conduct of the British generals. Montague accused the latter of being influenced by the &quot;public school ethos&quot; which he condemned as being anti-intellectual; Montague described the &quot;public school spirit&quot; as a &quot;gallant, robust contempt for &quot;swats&quot; and &quot;smugs&quot; and all who invented new means to new ends and who trained and used their brains with a will&quot;.

Montague published a collection of essays, &quot;The Right Place: A Book of Pleasures&quot; (1924). This book celebrated Montague&#x27;s interests, including cycling, mountaineering, and architecture.

He returned to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, but felt that his role was diminishing as the years passed. He finally retired in 1925, and settled down to become a full-time writer in the last years of his life. On a visit to London in 1928 he caught pneumonia, and he died of the illness in May 1928 at the age of 61. Montague was survived by his wife, five sons and two daughters.

Montague was the father of Evelyn Montague, the Olympic athlete and journalist depicted in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot;

==Critical Reception==

<text>Côte-Rôtie () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. The vineyards are located just south of Vienne in the communes of Saint-Cyr-sur-le-Rhône, Ampuis, and Tupin-et-Semons. The vineyards are unique because of the steep slopes facing the river and their stone walls. &quot;Côte-Rôtie&quot; can be rendered in English as &quot;the roasted slope&quot; and refers to the long hours of sunlight that these steep slopes receive.

The wines are red, made with Syrah grapes and up to 20% Viognier, a white grape used for its aroma. According to appellation rules, Syrah and Viognier (if used) must be fermented at the same time, a process known as cofermentation. Because of this combination, Côte-Rôtie wine typically exhibits an almost paradoxical pairing of meat aromas (including bacon) and floral aromas. 

==Climate and geography==

The Côte-Rôtie, and more generally the northern Rhône, has a continental climate that is very different from the more Mediterranean climate of the southern Rhône. Winters are wet and marked by the cold &quot;mistral&quot; winds that can last into the spring. During the late spring and early autumn, fog can settle on the vineyards making the ripening of grapes a challenge. The wine region covers along the western bank of the Rhône River near the village of Ampuis. In the Côte-Rôtie, the Rhône flows southwest for . To maximize the amount of sunshine that the vines receive (especially with the fog that often develops near the grape harvest time), vineyards will more often be planted on the south- or southeast-facing slopes along this part of the river. The Côte-Rôtie is subdivided into two main sections of varying soil compositions - the Côte Brune (&quot;brown slope&quot;) in the north on dark, iron-rich schist and the Côte Blonde with its pale granite and schist soil. Erosion is a common viticultural hazard on these steep vineyards. The granite and schist soils are vital in retaining heat throughout the day to protect the vines from the chilly temperatures during the &quot;mistral&quot; seasons. Stone walls are built around the lands, and the hillsides are often heavily terraced to try to counter the issues. Some vineyard owners gather the eroded soils and rocks in buckets and carry them back up the slope to the vines.

==Grapes and wine==
Syrah and Viognier are the only permitted grape varieties of the Côte-Rôtie AOC. While many of the region&#x27;s wines are made of 100% Syrah, up to 20% of Viognier can be added to the wine. The wines are often meant to be consumed 5–6 years after vinification but well-made examples can need 10–15 years to fully develop their flavors with some wines having the aging potential of over 20 years. The most distinctive characteristic of all Côte-Rôtie wine is the aroma. The fragrant notes of these wines often include green olives, raspberry, violets, and meaty bacon. Other flavors commonly associated with Côte-Rôtie wine include black pepper, white pepper, blueberry, blackberry, plum, and leather. The vines of the region are very old, with 40 years being an average and some vines being over 100. This produces low wine yields of very flavor-concentrated fruit. Most of the vineyards used for producing Côte-Rôtie AOC are planted on the slopes of nearly 60° incline. The appellation extends to the flatter plateau above the slopes but the wine there is generally of lower quality and is sold with the more generic Côtes du Rhône AOC. 

Legend has that the two sub-regions of the Côte-Rôtie, Côte Blonde and Côte Brune, were named after the blonde and brown hair colored daughters of a local lord who had two very different personalities. Similarly, the wines of both regions also have different characteristics. Wines of the Côte Blonde are often more balanced, elegant and meant to be consumed earlier. Wines of the iron-rich Côte Brune contain more tannins, are full-bodied and meant to age longer in the bottle prior to being consumed. Traditionally, most Côte-Rôtie wines are blends of grapes from the two sub-regions, incorporating both sets of distinctive qualities. 

In recent years, more single vineyard designated wines have been produced that emphasize the &quot;terroir&quot; of that vineyard. Marcel Guigal was an early pioneer in single vineyard bottling. Some of the most prestigious vineyards in the Côte-Rôtie include, La Chatillone, La Chevalière, La Garde, La Landonne, La Mouline, La Turque. 

===Winemaking===
The Côte-Rôtie is one of the few wine appellations that allow white wine grapes to be used in a blend of red wine. (The southern Rhône region Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC is another.) The region was also one of the first Rhône regions to make use of new oak barrels for aging, though the practice fell out of favor in the late 19th century following the phylloxera epidemic. Négociants revived the practice in the 1980s and today its use varies according to the producer.

==History==

The earliest record of viticulture in the region dates to the 2nd century BC when the Romans first encountered the Allobroges tribe whose territory included the regions around Vienne. While winemaking continued to have a long history in the region, the Côte-Rôtie did not receive much recognition until the 18th century when Parisians began discovering the wines of Beaujolais and Rhône. Around the same time, the British also discovered the wines with the purchase logs of John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol providing one of the earliest English records of &quot;Côte-Rôty&quot; (sic) wine. There were added considerations with the transportation of Côte-Rôtie wine, with the region using 20-U.S. gallon (76 liter) amphora-like vases for transport instead of barrels or early wine bottles. 

Until a few decades ago, Côte-Rôtie was not a serious competitor to Hermitage, which was the best-known northern Rhône vineyard internationally. Demand for Rhône wines began to grow in the early 1970s, and this growth accelerated from the late 1970s/early 1980s. For Côte-Rôtie it was the wines of Marcel Guigal which gave the appellation increased attention from the early 1980s. This included top marks from international wine critics for Guigal&#x27;s wines &quot;La Mouline&quot; and &quot;La Landonne&quot;. This increase in demand led to new vineyards being created. From 1982 to 2005, the area with planted vines increased from to .

The origins of the Côte-Rôtie most famous planting—Syrah—is confirmed to be indigenous to the Rhone valley. Syrah has been genetically shown to be a cross between Mondeuse Blanche and Dureza.

<doc id="1126755" wikidata="Q2992326" url="?curid=1126755" title="Condrieu AOC">
<text>Condrieu (; from the French &quot;coin de ruisseau,&quot; , ) is a French wine-growing &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) located in the northern Rhône, near Vienne and to the south of the Côte-Rôtie AOC. The vineyards are situated in the seven communes of Limony, Chavanay, Malleval, Saint-Michel-sur-Rhône, Saint-Pierre-de Boeuf, Vérin, and Condrieu. These communes are in the French departments of Ardèche, Rhône and Loire on the steep slopes of the foothills of the Massif Central on the right bank of the Rhône. The four southernmost communes can also produce wine under the Saint-Joseph AOC. The wines made in this AOC are exclusively white, from the Viognier grape, which may have originated in the region. The smaller AOC of Château-Grillet is enclaved within Condrieu and produces wines that are also 100% Viognier. The Condrieu AOC was officially created in 1940.

==History==
Viticulture in the area around Condrieu has existed since at least Roman times and it is possible that the area was first cultivated by the native Allobroges tribe. In the 18th century, Condrieu enjoyed a period of popularity as it gained access to the lucrative Parisian market. The wine was transported north by land to the city of Saint-Étienne where the Loire would carry the wine to the Canal de Briare and then to Paris. During periods of peace between France and Great Britain, Condrieu would find its way to the London market.

For most of the 20th century before the early 1970s, the only northern Rhône wine well-known far from the region was Hermitage, and there was little demand on the export market for Rhône wines. Producing wine from hillside vineyards requires more labour than on flat vineyards, and is therefore economically difficult when demand and prices are low. This was particularly felt by some Rhône appellations in the early post-World War II era, including Condrieu and its neighbour Côte-Rôtie, with the 1950s and 1960s a particularly difficult time. Rhône wines in general started to be more in demand from the early 1970s, and stronger so from the late 1970s/early 1980s. From this time, the négociant business of Marcel Guigal at Ampuis helped expand the market for Condrieu wines. Guigal primarily made his name with his Côte-Rôtie wines which then paved the way for his bottlings from other appellations, which also includes a significant portion of white wine. Guigal&#x27;s Condrieu was sourced from small growers in the appellation.

The increase in demand led to new plantations inside the appellation&#x27;s border, which at the time was far from fully exploited and at one stage included many abandoned vineyards. The area under vine was less than in the 1960s, in 1982, at the end of the century and in 2005.

==Climate and geography==
As in much of Northern Rhone, the climate of Condrieu is continental and characterized by cold wet winters and hot summers. Ideally situated vineyards are planted on granite soils and face south, which aids growth during the cool months of late spring and early autumn. The well-drained granite soil retains heat during the day and reflects it back to the vines at night. In some areas the soil includes a fine layer of decomposed chalk, flint and mica which is known in the region as &quot;arzelle&quot;. The best vineyards have some natural shelter from the fierce northern winds that blow through the region and wreak havoc during flowering. The steep incline of many vineyards exposes them to soil erosion. 

The Condrieu AOC covers more than 500 acres (202 ha) of hilly terrain located along a 12 miles (19 km) stretch of the Rhône. The AOC region begins at the town of Condrieu and extends south along the west bank of the river to the town of Limony. Within the AOC is 8.5 acres (3.4 ha) of Château-Grillet, which has its own micro-appellation.

==Wine==

The only wine that can be sold under the Condrieu AOC is a white wine made entirely from Viognier. The clone of Viognier grown in Condrieu produces low yields of small berries and is less productive than the clones planted in other regions of France, such as the &quot;vin de pays&quot; wine of the neighboring Ardèche department. This contributes to the expense of Condrieu AOC wine, of which only 30 000 or so cases are produced annually. In the early to mid 20th century, Condrieu producers tended to make wines that were off-dry to sweet but by the end of the century the trend was to produce mostly dry wines. In particularly favourable vintages, some producers will make a sweet late harvest wine.

Condrieu wine is often characterised by delicate aromatics of peaches, dried fruit and white flowers. Some examples also have notes of anise, star fruit and melons. Often the wine is full bodied and rich in a style that is texturally similarly to Chardonnay. Normally the wine is made dry but the fruitiness and perfume of the bouquet can suggest sweetness. The Viognier grape is naturally low in acidity, which challenges growers and winemakers to keep the wine from becoming flabby and bleak. Some winemakers in the region use malolactic fermentation and some do not. The delicate flavors of the wine can be overwhelmed by too much oak during the winemaking process.

===Aging===
The ability of Condrieu to age is much discussed in the wine industry and opinions differ. Some experts like Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan believe that it is best consumed within three years of harvest. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Wine&quot; describes Condrieu as one of the few luxury wines that is meant to be consumed young, typically within two to four years. Wine writer Tom Stevenson recommends drinking Condrieu within four to eight years of harvest and notes that its freshness and purity can be lost as the wine ages. James Molesworth of &quot;Wine Spectator&quot; notes that some vintages of Condrieu, such as the 2004, will produce more intense, concentrated wines that will age gracefully.

== Appellation regulations ==

The Condrieu AOC can only be used for still white wines made from Viognier. The planting density must be at least 6 500 vines per hectare, and the base yield is 41 hectoliter per hectare. The grape must reach a maturity giving at least 178 g/L sugar in the must (corresponding to 10.5 per cent potential alcohol) and the finished wines must have at least 11.5 per cent alcohol by volume, but no more than 14 per cent after any chaptalisation. If the wine has more than 45 grams per liter of sugar (only applicable for rare sweet Condrieu wines), it must not have been chaptalised to reach that sugar level.

<text>Athletic Club of Port of Spain (previously known as North East Stars FC) is a Trinidad and Tobago professional football club based in Port of Spain, Trinidad, that plays in the TT Premier Football League. The team plays its home games at the Hasely Crawford Stadium.

==History==
The team joined the Professional Football League as North East Stars F.C. beginning in the 2002 season, having previously played in Trinidad&#x27;s ECFU league. The team joined the league with the explicit intention of representing the north-east of Trinidad, previously underrepresented in football circles.

The team was terrible in their first season, finishing last in the league with a dismal record of 4 wins, 2 ties, and 22 losses. They improved dramatically in 2003, however, jumping from last to third, as they went 19–7–10. They improved even further in 2004, surprising everyone by winning the league with a dominant 14–5–2 performance. They finished 5th in 2005.

The club&#x27;s Jerren Nixon finished the 2004 season as the league&#x27;s leading scorer with a staggering 31 goals, 17 in front of second place Randolph Jerome&#x27;s 14.

In 2020, the club moved to Port of Spain and changed its name.

<text>Antoni Protazy Potocki (11 September 1761 – 1801), aka Prot, was a Polish nobleman and an early entrepreneur. 

==Biography==
He was born to Paula née Szembek and her second husband, Count Jan Prosper Potocki, Starosta of Guzów. He was a younger half-brother of Feliks Lubienski and older half-brother of Michal Kleofas Oginski and his sister, Józefa Ogińska.

Antoni was voivode of Kiev in 1791 and briefly, starost of Guzów. He became a banker in Warsaw.

As proprietor of the Chudniv estate, he established several factories in the village of Makhnivka, near Berdychiv. He was director the &quot;Polish Black Sea Trading Company&quot;, and ran an import-export business in Russian-ruled Kherson. According to his great nephew, Thomas Wentworth Łubieński, &quot;Prot&quot; turned Odessa from a &quot;sleepy fishing village&quot; into an international trade centre. This subsequently attracted the attention of Catherine the Great who turned the thriving port into one of Russia&#x27;s leading cities. Potocki had inherited wealth from his father. Due to the economic crisis in the country Potocki was bankrupt in 1793.
He was invested as a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle, awarded on May 8, 1781.

He stood and weighed at the age of 21, but experienced a second phase of growth in his late thirties, attaining a height of .

Myllyrinne was born in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland, and is considered the tallest soldier ever, having served in the Finnish Defence Forces. He underwent his conscript training in 1929 in the Viipuri Heavy Artillery Regiment, and was tall and very strong. In the 1930s he travelled around Europe as a professional wrestler and circus performer. He returned to Finland in 1939 to serve in the Finnish Army during the Winter War. In 1946, he moved to Järvenpää and ran a chicken farm. He died in Helsinki in 1963 and is buried at Järvenpää.

<text>Château-Grillet is a wine-growing AOC in the northern Rhône wine region of France, near Vienne, which produces white wine from Viognier grapes. The whole appellation, which is only in size, is owned by a single winery, Château-Grillet. The appellation was officially created in 1936.

Château-Grillet AOC is effectively an enclave of the Condrieu appellation, which also produces Viognier-only white wines. These appellations are located just south of Vienne in the northern part of the Rhône valley. The production of white wine in the Rhône region is relatively small compared to the red wines. Condrieu and Château-Grillet are the only appellations in northern Rhône that are exclusively white wine appellations.

The situation of an AOC (or other official wine designation) owned by a single estate is a situation known as a monopole. There are several other monopole estates in France including Romanée-Conti, La Tâche, La Romanée, Clos de Tart, and Clos de la Coulée de Serrant. The Neyret-Gachet family acquired the Château-Grillet estate in 1830, and the family retained ownership until the estate was purchased by French billionaire François Pinault in 2011. As of 2019, winemaker Chu Jaeok, formerly of Domaine d’Eugenie, became the first woman to make the estate&#x27;s single wine: Vin Blanc de Château-Grillet. Less than 10,000 bottles are produced each year. The estate also produces two Brandies: Fine du Château-Grillet and Marc du Château-Grillet. The former is distilled from the Château-Grillet wine while the latter is a pomace brandy.

The vineyards stretch over two communes: Saint-Michel-sur-Rhône and Vérin.

The vines are situated in terraces on steep granite cliffs surrounding the estate where the soil is lighter and more fragmented than in the Condrieu AOC. The slopes are shaped in the form of a natural amphitheater with south-southeastern sun exposure. The estate&#x27;s vines average 40 years of age, and as a result produce very low yields.

The slim brown bottles of Château-Grillet are easily recognised and are used by no other French winery. Until 1987, bottles were used, but bottles have been used since.

==Vineyard==

Château-Grillet is one of the smallest appellations in France, but the area under vine expanded in the 1970s and 1980s (the era when Rhône wines started to see an increase in demand), from in 1971, to in 1977, in 1982 and in 1991, which has remained the vineyard area until at least 2005. This was achieved by actually planting the full area within the appellation border, and this is now practically fully planted to vines. Château-Grillet is sometimes erroneously claimed to be the smallest appellation in France, which is incorrect since several Burgundy Grand Cru appellations are smaller. At the start of the 1970s expansion, Château-Grillet was actually of the same size as Romanée-Conti, but its neighbour La Romanée is only of half as large, or .

==Wine style==
Château-Grillet is by tradition a wine which is intended to be drunk with some maturity, often around 10 years or more from the vintage year. This style has been kept by the appellation&#x27;s single producer and sets Château-Grillet apart from the Condrieu wines from most producers, or indeed almost all wines produced from Viognier grapes, which are styled to be drunk fairly young and often aims more for opulence.

Aromas present in a good vintage Château-Grillet are typically apricot, truffle, and honey on the nose, and apricot, orange and tangerine on the palate. More floral aromas are present on the nose with some aging, typically eight years or more. The fruit aromas associated with Château-Grillet are therefore somewhat different than from those typically found in Condrieu, where pear is often found.

Château-Grillet cellars its wines for at least 24 months in a combination of new and old oak barriques.

===Appellation regulations===

The Château-Grillet AOC can only be used for still white wines made from Viognier. The planting density must be at least 8,000 vines per hectare, and the base yield is 37 hectoliters per hectare, thus equalling about 14,000 litres (19,000 bottles) per year. The grape must reach a maturity giving at least 178 grams per liter of sugar in the must (corresponding to 10.5 per cent potential alcohol), and the finished wines must have at least 11.5 per cent alcohol by volume but no more than 14 per cent after any chaptalisation. The wines must be dry with a maximum of 4 grams per liter of sugar.

<doc id="1126769" wikidata="Q5209391" url="?curid=1126769" title="Daily build">
<text>A daily build or nightly build is a software build of the latest version of a software system, run automatically on a daily/nightly basis. 

This is so it can first be compiled to ensure that all required dependencies are present, and possibly tested to show no bugs have been introduced. The daily build is also often publicly available allowing access to the latest features for feedback.
In this context, a &quot;build&quot; is the result of compiling and linking all the files that make up a program. The use of such disciplined procedures as daily builds is particularly necessary in large organizations where many programmers are working on a single piece of software. Performing daily builds helps ensure that developers can work knowing with reasonable certainty that any new bugs that show up are a result of their own work done within the last day.

Daily builds typically include a set of tests, sometimes called a &quot;smoke test.&quot; These tests are included to assist in determining what may have been broken by the changes included in the latest build. The critical piece of this process is to include new and revised tests as the project progresses.

== Continuous integration builds ==

Although daily builds were considered a best practice of software development in the 1990s, they have now been superseded. Continuous integration is now run on an almost continual basis, with a typical cycle time of around 20-30 minutes since the last change to the source code. Continuous integration servers continually monitor the source code control system. When these servers detect new changes, they use a build tool to rebuild the software. Good practice today is also to use continuous integration as part of continuous testing, so that unit tests are re-run for each build, and more extensive functional testing (which takes longer to perform than the build) performed as frequently as its duration permits.

<doc id="1126772" wikidata="Q465180" url="?curid=1126772" title="Crozes-Hermitage AOC">
<text>Crozes-Hermitage () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. The appellation is the largest in the northern Rhone, and its wines are less highly regarded than those from the nearby appellations of Côte-Rôtie or its near-namesake Hermitage. Most of the wines produced here are red wines made from the Syrah grape, sometimes blended with small quantities of white Roussanne or Marsanne grapes. Some white wines are also made, based on Marsanne and/or Roussanne.

==History==
In 1846, a panel of tasters commended the wine for its likeness to Hermitage wines. The appellation was officially defined in 1937 and was expanded in 1952.

==Climate and geography==

Crozes-Hermitage, along with the rest of northern Rhône has a continental climate that differs from its southern neighbour, which has a more Mediterranean climate. Winters are wet and marked by the cold &quot;mistral&quot; winds that can last into the Spring. The appellation is fairly large by Northern Rhône standards, with its 1,238 hectares accounting for approximately half of the entire region&#x27;s 2,400 hectares. The appellation&#x27;s boundary begins around 10 km north of Tain-l&#x27;Hermitage, extends around the village of Gervans with its south- and south-western granite slopes and then spreads south around Larnage where the land flattens and consists of more clay. Approaching Tain and the village of Mercurol the land rises again and the appellation spreads east. In this region, the soil is mostly rocks, sand and clay. Just south of Tain &quot;galets roulés&quot;, small surface stones also found extensively in Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the southern Rhône, appear. The southernmost part of the appellation is flat and newly planted.

==Grapes and wine==
As with the northern Rhône in general, Crozes-Hermitage produces primarily red wines, with Syrah the only red grape permitted under appellation rules. The rules allow the addition of up to 15% of the white grapes Marsanne and Roussanne. Those two varieties are also used in the white wines in the appellation. The more notable vineyards in Crozes-Hermitage include Les Chassis, Les Sept Chemins and Les Meysonniers.

Many of the red wines are relatively light and intended for early drinking, while others will keep and improve in bottle for several years.

===Winemaking===
Crozes-Hermitage is notable for the large amount of cooperative wine. Cave de Tain, a large cooperative, takes half of the grapes grown. Another large producer, Jaboulet, takes a lot of the other half, and also owns its own vineyards. Although a small amount of white grapes can be included when making red wines in this AOC, more and more varietal 100% Syrah wines are being made.

<doc id="1126774" wikidata="Q2973323" url="?curid=1126774" title="Cornas AOC">
<text>Cornas () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France based in Cornas, south of Lyon. It is one of the smallest appellations in the Rhône valley and produces only red wine, from the Syrah grape.

==History==
The name Cornas is Celtic for &quot;burnt earth&quot;, and the first written sources mention wine in the region as early as 885. Both Louis XV and Cardinal Richelieu are said to have been admirers of the wine. Cornas became an official appellation in 1938 although it was not until 1950 that the first local producers began bottling the wine themselves.

==Climate and geography==
Cornas, along with the rest of the northern Rhône, has a continental climate rather than the Mediterranean climate found in the south. However unlike some of the other northern Rhône appellations, Cornas is mostly shielded from the cold &quot;le mistral&quot; winds that can last into the Spring, and is often the first appellation in the north to begin the harvest. The vineyards are just north of Valence, in a fairly small area of steep slopes facing east-southeast, south of Tain l&#x27;Hermitage. The vineyards are situated between and above sea level. In the northern part, especially near &quot;Les Chaillot&quot;, the soil contains chalk but is mostly sandy and rocky, with characteristic reddish-brown dirt. The sunny sector of &quot;&quot;Quartier de Reynard&quot; which has vines at has a granite soil. To the south, near &quot;La Côte&quot; and &quot;La Combe&quot;&quot;, the soil is mostly clay. It is a small appellation of only , with an average output of . By way of comparison there are individual châteaux in Bordeaux which produce more wine than the entire Cornas appellation.

==Grapes and wine==
Along with most wines produced in the northern Rhône, Cornas is a red wine made from the Syrah grape. No white wines are produced. Any wines designated Cornas AOC will be made from 100% Syrah by law. Although growers could plant different grape varieties in Cornas, the appellation is planted exclusively with Syrah as any wine made from other grapes would have to be sold under a different label, probably Côtes du Rhône AOC and as a result would fetch a lower price.

Cornas used to produce wines which required long ageing, but a new more fruit forward style has emerged under the impulse of winemaker Jean-Luc Colombo. Several producers still produce a more traditional style which typically requires 6–7 years in barrel and bottle before it is approachable.

<doc id="1126777" wikidata="Q1024694" url="?curid=1126777" title="Nightbreed">
<text>Nightbreed is a 1990 American dark fantasy horror film written and directed by Clive Barker, based on his 1988 novella &quot;Cabal&quot;. It stars Craig Sheffer, Anne Bobby, David Cronenberg, Charles Haid, Hugh Quarshie, and Doug Bradley. The film follows an unstable mental patient named Aaron Boone who is falsely led to believe by his doctor that he is a serial killer. Tracked down by the police, his doctor, and his girlfriend Lori, Boone eventually finds refuge in an abandoned cemetery called Midian among a tribe of monsters and outcasts known as the &quot;Nightbreed&quot; who hide from humanity.

At the time of its release, the film was a commercial and critical failure. In several interviews, Barker protested that the film company tried to sell it as a standard slasher film, and that the powers-that-be had no real working knowledge of &quot;Nightbreed&quot;″s story. Since its initial theatrical release, &quot;Nightbreed&quot; has become a cult film.

Over time, Barker expressed disappointment with the final cut approved by the studio and always longed for the recovery of the reels so the film might be re-edited. In 2014, original film elements for the cut material were re-obtained and were edited into a director&#x27;s cut, released through Scream Factory.

==Plot==
Aaron Boone has recurring nightmares of a place called Midian. His girlfriend Lori Winston encourages him to resume psychotherapy with Dr. Phillip Decker. Meanwhile, a serial killer has been massacring entire families. When Boone returns to Decker&#x27;s office, he is horrified to learn that his dreams mirror these ritualistic killings. Decker tells Boone to turn himself in and start taking lithium, but he actually gives Boone LSD.

Boone is hospitalized during the resulting trip. Another patient is ranting about Midian and explains where it is. When the patient peels his face off, Boone escapes from the hospital during the commotion and heads to Midian. All he finds there is a graveyard where he falls asleep. At night, he is confronted by monstrous beings who argue over whether he belongs there. Boone claims he is a murderer, but they know he is not. One of them tries to eat Boone, but he escapes.

Outside the graveyard, Boone is confronted by the police who have been led there by Dr. Decker. He tricks the police into shooting Boone. In the morgue, Boone is revived by the bite he received in the graveyard. He returns to Midian and learns about the Nightbreed who live there. He is inducted into their society through the blood of their deity Baphomet.

Lori follows Boone&#x27;s path to Midian. She is followed there by Decker who is the serial killer. He framed Boone for the murders in an attempt to locate the Nightbreed. He tries to lure Boone out of Midian by using Lori, but Boone rescues her. The Nightbreed explain that they are just creatures from folklore who used to live in peace until humans tried to extinguish them. They banish Lori and Boone from Midian.

They check into a motel but find that Decker has been there and slaughtered people in the room next door. Boone is arrested for Decker&#x27;s murders, and the doctor convinces the police to storm Midian. His ultimate goal is to destroy the Nightbreed.

While the police head to Midian, several Nightbreed break Boone out of jail and enlist his help. A chaotic battle ensues between the Nightbreed and the police. Decker confronts Boone and is killed. Boone seeks out Baphomet, and he explains that Boone has caused the end of Midian, which had been foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed and renames him Cabal.

Determined to stay with Boone, Lori commits suicide and Boone resurrects her with a bite. He promises the Nightbreed that he will follow Baphomet&#x27;s orders.

In the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker&#x27;s corpse and states that he wants vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. When he presses Baphomet&#x27;s blood to Decker&#x27;s wound, Decker springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry repeatedly hollers &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;.

=== Alternative endings ===
==== The Cabal Cut ====
In &quot;The Cabal Cut&quot;, the resurrection of Decker plays as a post-credits scene.

==== Director&#x27;s Cut ====
In the alternative ending used in &quot;The Cabal Cut&quot; and &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; of the film, Narcisse is killed earlier in the battle by Decker, so he is not present during the subsequent events. The Nightbreed await Boone in a barn whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori, as he must find a new home for the Nightbreed. Boone promises to return to her, but knowing that Boone will retain his youth and immortality as she grows old, Lori suddenly stabs herself, forcing Boone to resurrect her as a Nightbreed. They profess their love for one another and begin their journey.

Meanwhile, Captain Eigerman wanders the underground remains of the cemetery where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry, who longs for revenge after his burning by Baphomet. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects Eigerman&#x27;s offer, kills him, and starts his hunt for the Nightbreed.

The surviving Nightbreed watch Boone and Lori in the distance. Rachel tells Babette that Boone will return soon, perhaps the next day, to lead them to a new haven. Boone and Lori now appear together as part of a prophecy in a Nightbreed painting.

==Themes and interpretations==

&quot;Nightbreed&quot; has been characterized as containing themes related to queerness and the LGBT community. In 1997, author Harry M. Benshoff called it, &quot;One of the first horror films to make an explicit connection between monsters and the activist politics of the queer community&quot;.

Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky called &quot;Nightbreed&quot; &quot;the first truly gay horror fantasy epic&quot;, explaining how the unconsummated relationship between doctor and patient is in his view the central theme. In 2015, Tyler Coates of &quot;Decider&quot; called Jodorowsky&#x27;s interpretation of the characters&#x27; relationship as being &quot;only the tip of the iceberg and, I&#x27;d argue, a red herring&quot;; Coates focuses instead on the presence of queer subtext &quot;blatantly seen in the Nightbreed&#x27;s culture&quot;, writing that, &quot;Because normalcy is subjective and based solely on how the majority defines it, it&#x27;s important to establish mini-societies and cultures with people like you.&quot;

In 2019, Trace Thurman of &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot; wrote that the Nightbreed as depicted in the film &quot;represent queerness, or any fill-in-the-blank &#x27;Other&#x27; you can think of.&quot; Noting that, beyond writer-director Clive Barker being &quot;one of the most famous queer horror artists of our time [...] The narrative itself is filled to the brim with queerness and serves as an allegory for intolerance. Can anyone watch &quot;Nightbreed&quot; and not automatically associate the titular creatures with queer people? They&#x27;ve been outcast by society and are deemed as dangerous by the &#x27;normal&#x27; people. The climax of the film culminates in an assault on the Nightbreed&#x27;s home base of Midian as the &#x27;normies&#x27; would rather kill all of them as opposed to understand them.&quot; That same year, Leigh Monson of &quot;Birth. Movies. Death.&quot; wrote that the director&#x27;s cut of the film &quot;places on display the full scope of a narrative that is a broad and potent allegory for the persecution of the queer community.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Charles Bramesco also examined the presence of queer themes in the film&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut, writing that some of its homoerotic subtext was initially removed when executives at 20th Century Fox demanded that the film be trimmed during its post-production. Bramesco argued, &quot;They were blind to the subtext of this community as a home for misfits, where the placeless Boone—who doesn&#x27;t seem all that interested in sex with his torch-singing girlfriend—can find an accepting family. The director&#x27;s cut allows us more time with the creatures and ups their number, emphasizing that they&#x27;re only fearsome to those afraid of difference.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
Barker always loved monsters and felt that &quot;there&#x27;s a corner of all of us that envies their powers and would love to live forever, or to fly, or to change shape at will. So, when I came to make a movie about monsters, I wanted to create a world we&#x27;d feel strangely at home in&quot;. He was interested in creating a &quot;horror mythology from the ground up&quot; and developing characters that would live on in sequels. As he finished writing the novella &quot;Cabal&quot;, he realized that it would make a good film that he would direct himself. He originally envisioned a trilogy of films. Mark Frost wrote the initial draft of the screenplay for Barker.

&quot;Nightbreed&quot; was the first of a planned three-picture deal Barker had with Morgan Creek, Joe Roth&#x27;s production company, that included an adaptation of &quot;Son of Celluloid&quot; and a sequel to &quot;Nightbreed&quot;. The first compromise Barker made was to change the title of the film from &quot;Cabal&quot; to &quot;Nightbreed&quot; because Morgan Creek insisted on a more commercial title and thought that the original one did not mean anything. He was given a budget of $11 million, which was a considerable increase from the $2 million he had to work with on &quot;Hellraiser&quot;. His goal was to make the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of horror films. The monsters in the book are represented impressionistically over two or three paragraphs and the challenge Barker faced was to visualize them in much greater detail for the film.

Originally several of the creatures were supposed to be stop motion puppets, in addition to pixilation for the Boone and Peloquin transformation scenes, but make-up gradually replaced the puppets, and barely any of the stop motion made it till the finished movie. Animator Rory Fellowes said &quot;The fact is we were too late for stopmotion and too early for CG&quot;.

===Filming===
For the film, Barker used three soundstages at Pinewood Studios shooting some scenes on location at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough, Berkshire, UK over several nights and in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Bob Keen and his crew had two months to play around with ideas before doing any modeling work. They used computer-controlled animatronics but only where necessary. Towards the end of principal photography, Barker brought &quot;Star Wars&quot; concept artist Ralph McQuarrie in to paint mattes for the Necropolis sequences and design the history of the Breed in a symbolic way on an enormous mural across a 60-foot space on the set at Pinewood to be used in the opening credits.

During an interview in 2022 on &quot;The Ghost of Hollywood&quot;, cinematographer Robin Vidgeon mentioned that he disliked working with David Cronenberg, stating Cronenberg complained to Clive that he was being usurped.

Barker was contractually obligated to deliver an R-rated film and could not make it as gory as his previous picture &quot;Hellraiser&quot;. Barker previewed the first cut of &quot;Nightbreed&quot; with a temporary soundtrack that did not go well, as people were confused by the characters&#x27; motives. He made some changes and the second test screening was much more successful. However, the ending with Decker&#x27;s death was not well received and Barker changed it. In late July 1989, the studio pushed the release date for &quot;Nightbreed&quot; from its original autumn 1989 date to early February 1990 instead. The press release cited &quot;the complex demands of the film&#x27;s ground-breaking post-production optical effects&quot;, but this also included McQuarrie&#x27;s mural and matte paintings, and a week of additional shooting in late August that would see key parts of the narrative re-shot. Barker shot extra scenes over three days in Los Angeles in late 1989 which included additional scenes with David Cronenberg which expanded and clarified his character. Barker&#x27;s original version ran two-and-a-half hours and Fox asked for almost an hour to be cut prompting editor Richard Marden to leave the project in protest. &quot;Nightbreed&quot; was cut to two hours and then again to 102 minutes.

==Soundtrack==


The score was composed by Danny Elfman and conducted by Shirley Walker, who also wrote the additional cue &quot;Charge of the Berserkers&quot; for the film&#x27;s climax and received an onscreen credit. Elfman said of his score: &quot;Once again it was time for me to stretch out... Combining dark/fun/sweet/tribal all into one. The great joy in the score for me, other than working for Clive Barker, was being able to use the children&#x27;s voices and a whole slew of ethnic drums and instruments together with an orchestra, in an attempt to bring a unique musical tone to the film&quot;. Barker said &quot;Danny is an extraordinary talent. The most uncompromised portion of that entire movie is the score&quot;.

In an article on Elfman, described as a rising composer in Hollywood who had just scored Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; and was about to score Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ron Givens noted that &quot;Nightbreed&quot; wouldn&#x27;t get as much attention as these two big-budget movies, yet Givens praised Elfman&#x27;s &quot;needle-sharp crescendos and creepy choral plainchants&quot; and added: &quot;Seldom has scary-movie music been so spiritual&quot;.

The song &quot;Country Skin&quot; is a country-and-western rendition of the Oingo Boingo song &quot;Skin&quot; (which appears on the 1990 album &quot;Dark at the End of the Tunnel&quot;), it was written by Elfman and performed by country singer Michael Stanton. It can be heard in the film, played on a radio. It was available as a bonus track on the CD and cassette version of the soundtrack.

==Release==
===Marketing===
According to Barker, the studio did not promote it well with posters that misinterpreted the content. When he saw the way they were selling &quot;Nightbreed&quot;, he freaked out and said: &quot;What you doing? This isn&#x27;t the movie, and was given all kinds of excuses ... Well, there isn&#x27;t time to change it, we have to release it now&quot;. The head of marketing at Morgan Creek never watched all the way through because it &quot;disgusted and distressed&quot; him, according to Barker. The studio did not understand it, it had no movie stars, it was violent, and it had elements of fantasy and horror which they saw as a weakness while Barker saw it as a strength. They ended up marketing &quot;Nightbreed&quot; as a slasher film with television teasers that were confusing and did not represent it. The trailer was sent to the MPAA and it was rejected 12 times. They forbade any monster footage, and it was cut down to someone being terrorized with a razor, which constituted only five minutes of Barker&#x27;s film. Looking back, Barker realized that Fox was better at promoting films like &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump&quot; but &quot;not so good at selling the quirky stuff&quot;.

The studio argued that there was no point showing &quot;Nightbreed&quot; to critics because the people who see horror films do not read reviews. Therefore, the film had to be sold to the lowest common denominator. They refused to preview the film for critics, a decision which angered Barker.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Nightbreed&quot; was released on February 16, 1990, in 1,488 theaters, grossing $3.7 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $8.8 million in the United States and Canada and $7 million internationally for a worldwide total of $16 million on an $11 million budget.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports 51% of 35 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.6 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Nightbreed&quot;&#x27;s imaginative world-building and startling creature designs are no match for its clumsy, uneven plotting&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Henry Mietkiewicz wrote &quot;&quot;Nightbreed&quot; might have been a monster movie milestone, if Clive Barker&#x27;s directorial abilities had kept pace with his skill as a master of British horror fiction. Unfortunately, &quot;Nightbreed&quot; probably will be remembered as much for its haphazard plotting and underdeveloped characters as its delightfully daring concept&quot;. Derek Malcolm wrote in his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;it is neither direct nor subtle enough as a piece of film-making. It is difficult to suggest that evil is human and monsters have souls within the context of a mountain of special effects. The result is patchy in the extreme and not always capable of transcending a genre that has become less and less intriguing as less and less is left to the imagination&quot;.

However, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ty Burr gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating, writing: &quot;From the film&#x27;s Gothic sets, fantastic makeup, and nightmarish plot line, it&#x27;s clear that Barker owes as much to Poe and Lovecraft as to classic Hollywood screamers like &quot;Island of Lost Souls&quot;. But Barker&#x27;s most perverse touch is that he makes these creatures the good guys (no wonder the PR flacks were bamboozled). Despite their grotesque appearance, they&#x27;re a more colorful and engaging bunch than the emissaries of the &quot;normal&quot; world. Barker piles on more subversive subtext than his story can bear — it&#x27;s a monster movie, after all — but his daft, Grand Guignol vision has real power. The quality that freaked out the studio, Barker&#x27;s ambition, is precisely what makes &quot;Nightbreed&quot; so impressive&quot;.

==Accolades==
==Merchandise==
===Comic books===
In 1990, to tie in with the film&#x27;s box office release, Epic Comics produced a four-issue adaptation of the film, which included significant differences from the finished movie, more closely related to Clive Barker&#x27;s original script. The comic book continued to run past the end of the film, ultimately stretching to twenty-five issues before it was cancelled. The comic book was initially written by Alan Grant and John Wagner and drawn by Jim Baikie.

A two part graphic novel was also produced, &quot;Hellraiser vs Nightbreed: Jihad&quot;, which merges the two worlds created by Clive Barker and features the Cenobites as agents of order against their chaotic nemesis the Nightbreed, and the Jihad (Holy War) of extermination that the first wage on the latter.

&quot;Nightbreed&quot; returned in 1992, as a short story in the second issue of the four issue &quot;Epic&quot; anthology series.

A 12 issue mini-series was published by BOOM! Studios in 2014-2015 following the storyline of the Director&#x27;s Cut of the film.

===Video games===
Two video games based on the film were released shortly after the movie. The games were intended to form a trilogy but due to the poor performance of the first two the third was never made. &quot;Nightbreed, The Action Game&quot; was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and MS-DOS. &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Nightbreed: The Interactive Movie&quot; was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS.

==Legacy==
===TV series===
Morgan Creek reportedly began developing a television series based on the original film in 2014. In the following year, Morgan Creek announced the sale of the domestic rights to its library of 78 films, but the production company plans to retain the TV rights to &quot;Nightbreed&quot;. In June 2018, Syfy, Morgan Creek and Barker teamed up to develop the series. It is being written by Josh Stolberg and directed by Michael Dougherty for SyFy.

===&quot;The Cabal Cut&quot;===
In 2009, Mark Miller, co-head of Barker&#x27;s production company, Seraphim Films, helped track down the missing footage that was cut out of the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Nightbreed&quot;. Miller discovered, after talking to a production executive at the studio, that the footage was never actually lost but readily accessible. When asked, a studio executive said that there was not a big enough audience to warrant the studio spending money on a new, extended cut of the film. A VHS copy of Barker&#x27;s 145-minute version of the film&#x27;s mid-1989 workprint was discovered. It did not feature any of the re-shoots of Decker&#x27;s murders. An extended 159-minute cut version, from another VHS found in July 2009, premiered on March 27, 2010, as part of the HorrorHound Weekend in Indianapolis. This new version adds almost an hour that was cut from the theatrical release, including a song sung by Lori, and more animation. Barker said that he hopes to bring back Danny Elfman to add more music.

In early 2012, Russell Cherrington, a senior lecturer in film and video production at the University of Derby, created a composite cut of the film using the footage found on both VHS tapes and a DVD then recently released by Warner Archive Collection, Warner&#x27;s made-to-order DVD service. This version is the most complete version of Barker&#x27;s film available and has been dubbed &quot;The Cabal Cut&quot;. The cut runs 155 minutes long and was shown at that year&#x27;s &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot; in North Carolina with actors Craig Sheffer and Anne Bobby attending.

The &quot;Mad Monster Party&quot; projection of the &quot;Cabal Cut&quot; led to a renewal of interest among fans, especially on the Internet. A new petition was created and social networks were used to raise awareness for the extended cut and to encourage producers to release it. This would be colloquially known as &quot;Occupy Midian&quot;, a term coined by actress Anne Bobby.

A Blu-Ray release of the &quot;Cabal Cut&quot; was announced on July 13, 2017, via the Clive Barker Podcast. This release utilized then-restored footage from the Director&#x27;s Cut and the pre-existing VHS copies, for a total length of 145 minutes. The release features new material and commentary tracks exclusive to that release. Handled by Morgan Creek and Seraphim Films, the Cabal Cut Blu-Ray was released in a limited quantity through Clive Barker&#x27;s online store.

===Shout! Factory restoration and &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;===
In 2013, Shout! Factory released &quot;The Cabal Cut&quot; on DVD. This version was later clarified to be a brand new director&#x27;s cut that uses the footage and not the full &quot;Cabal Cut&quot;.

Shout! Factory released &quot;The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; Blu-ray in 2014. This version, overseen by Clive Barker, runs twenty minutes longer than the theatrical version and contains forty minutes of new and altered footage. Shout, with Morgan Creek Entertainment, located the original film elements in the Warner archives to newly restore the sequences. Barker said, &quot;when Scream Factory told me that they found the &quot;Nightbreed&quot; film footage, I was gob-smacked! This is the ultimate validation of choices made by myself and Mark Miller all the way back in 2008&quot;. Shout later published a Special Edition Blu-ray / DVD combo pack and a 3-disc limited edition Blu-ray, containing a booklet and the theatrical cut. When the limited edition sold out during pre-orders, Shout! doubled their production run.

<text>Count Roman Ignacy Potocki, generally known as Ignacy Potocki (; 1750–1809), was a Polish nobleman, member of the influential magnate Potocki family, owner of Klementowice and Olesin (near Kurów), a politician, statesman, writer, and office holder. He was the Marshal of the Permanent Council (Rada Nieustająca) in 1778–1782, Grand Clerk of Lithuania from 1773, Court Marshal of Lithuania from 1783, Grand Marshal of Lithuania from 16 April 1791 to 1794.

He was an educational activist, member of the Commission of National Education and the initiator and president of Society for Elementary Textbooks. He was an opponent of king Stanisław II August in the 1770s and 1780s, and a major figure in the Polish politics of that era. During the Great Sejm he was a leader of the Patriotic Party and the reform movement and eventually backed the King in many reform projects. An advocate of a pro-Prussian orientation, he helped conclude an alliance with Prussia in 1790. He co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791.

==Life==

===Youth===
Potocki was born in Radzyń on 28 February 1750 into the influential magnate Potocki family. He was the son of Eustachy Potocki and Marianna Kątska, brother of Jerzy Michał Potocki, Jan Nepomucen Eryk Potocki and Stanisław Kostka Potocki.

Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, where he was a student in the years 1761–1765. From 1765 he studied theology and law in Rome, where he attended the Collegium Nazarenum, up to about 1769. His parents intended for him to join the ranks of clergy, but he refused to follow this path. After traveling through Italy and Germany, he returned to Poland around 1771. On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska. This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia. Early on, Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries, being groomed as the next leader of Familia. From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus&#x27; Thursday Dinners.

===Political career===
As a member (1772–1791) of Poland&#x27;s Commission of National Education (&#x27;) – the world&#x27;s first ministry of education – he was the initiator of and presided over the Society for Elementary Textbooks (&#x27;, founded in 1775). He presided over the renovation of the Załuski&#x27;s Library (in 1774). He was involved in the development of numerous projects, such as the history curriculum. In 1781 he reviewed and endorsed Hugo Kołłątaj&#x27;s work at the Cracow Academy. His involvement with the educational projects earned him a nickname &quot;bakałarz&quot; (holder of baccalarius degree, teacher). His involvement with the educational reforms lessened only during the era of the Great Sejm (1788–1792), when he became increasingly involved with the wider reform program.
On 29 May 1773 he received the office of Great Clerk (Writer) of Lithuania, a relatively low-ranked position that was seen by some as below the magnates of the Potocki family. He participated in the Partition Sejm of 1773, where he sat on several commissions. Seeing himself in opposition to the king, he refused a seat on the Permanent Council that he was offered in March 1774. The king tried to appease him with the Order of Saint Stanislaus on 14 July that year, but that failed to bring Potocki to his side. Instead, Potocki became, for the next decade and half, one of his chief political critics and opponents; in 1776 he went to Moscow to argue, unsuccessfully, for limiting the power of king and the Russian ambassador, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg. Later that year, his election to the Sejm was disputed, and the king and Stackelberg managed to block his election. In 1778 however, the growing rift between the king and Stackelberg allowed him to take, through political maneuvering, the chairmanship of the Permanent Council Marshal of the Sejm. That year he also became a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle.

In 1779 Potocki joined the freemasonry, and by 1780 he advanced to the head of a freemasonry lodge. He became &quot;de facto&quot; head of the &quot;Familia&quot;, and of anti-royal opposition (succeeding its previous leader, Stanisław Lubomirski, upon his death in 1783). That year also saw the sudden death of his wife. During a trip to Italy and France, in absentia, the influence of the Familia resulted in his appointment to the office of the Court Marshal of Lithuania. He continued to oppose various royal projects at the Sejms of 1784 and 1786. In 1785 he lost some face for his involvement in the Dogrumowa affair, in which the king was falsely accused of an instigation of a poisoning attempt.

Disappointed with Russia&#x27;s lack of support for any serious reforms in Poland, he shifted to favoring an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia instead. Although this resulted in the split of the anti-royalist opposition, he was seen as the leader of opposition (the Patriotic Party) when the Great Sejm begun in 1788. After some initial political manevrouving, the issues of a closer relation with Prussia (that would eventually grow into the Polish-Prussian alliance) and a major reform of the government, both with which he was closely involved, begun accelerating in 1789. At first supportive more of a republican form of a government, political reality (such as royal faction victory at the elections of 1790) resulted in his acceptance of a more constitutional monarchy approach. In 1790, through the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, the king and Potocki begun drifting closer together, working on a draft document that would eventually become the 3 May 1791 constitution. Alongside Poniatowski, Kołłątaj and Piattoli, he is seen as one of the major authors of that document. He supported the quasi-coup d&#x27;état in which the constitution was passed on 3 May 1791.

On 17 May 1791, he resigned his position in the Commission of National Education to take an appointment (Minister of Police) in the newly created government, the Guard of Laws. From March 1792 he also held the position of Minister of War. During the War in the Defence of the Constitution in 1792, he went on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to Berlin to request assistance from the Prussian government. On 4 July 1792, a sudden depression made him resign his ministerial positions. A vocal opponent of the Targowica Confederation and likely an author of an anonymous anti-Targowica brochure, he was specifically requested by the Russian government to not be involved in the negotiations; he also refused to join the Targowica Confederation, even after Poniatowski&#x27;s accession to it.

===Final years===
Following the victory of the Targowica Confederation and the of the May 3rd Constitution, Potocki emigrated from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, settling in Leipzig. Together with Tadeusz Kościuszko, he proposed a plan for a French-Polish alliance of republics, that was however not met with much support in France. He co-authored a work with Hugo Kołłątaj, &quot;On the Adoption and Fall of the Polish Constitution of 3 May&quot; (&quot;O ustanowieniu i upadku Konstytucji Polskiej 3-go Maja&quot;, 1793).

Potocki participated in preparations for the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794. In early April he left Leipzig and arrived in Kraków. He was involved in unsuccessful diplomatic negotiations with various foreign powers, in a vain attempt to gain support for the insurgents. During the Uprising he served as a member of the Supreme National Council (&quot;&quot;), as a chief of its diplomatic department. Upon suppression of the Uprising, instead of emigrating again, he took part in the surrender negotiations, which gained him respect in many quarters. Eventually on 21 December 1794 he was imprisoned by the Tsarist Russian authorities. He has lost most of his wealth following the Uprising, as most of his estates were confiscated. Near the end of his life he would be troubled by his inability to pay off debts from the 1780s.

Released in 1796, following the death of Catherine the Great, Potocki retired to Kurów, Puławy county (central Poland). There he devoted himself to historical studies, publishing several books, translations and commentaries. He also wrote poems, but those were never published during his lifetime. Historians still debate over his potential authorship of several anonymous works (primarily political brochures). He distanced himself from activists discussing a new insurrection, but was nonetheless arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian authorities again in the years 1798–1800. In 1801 he joined the Warsaw Scientific Society. He returned to politics shortly after much of Galicia was liberated by Napoleon and attached to the Duchy of Warsaw. During the negotiations with Napoleon in Dresden he contracted severe diarrhea and died on 30 August 1809. He was buried in Wilanów.

He had no direct descendants, his only surviving daughter, Krystyna, (born 1778) died in 1800. His reduced estates were inherited by a nephew, Aleksander Potocki.

==Remembrance==
In private life, he is said to have had a weakness for gambling, but he also had a reputation of an honest reformer, who puts the good of the country above his own.

He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting, &quot;Constitution of 3 May 1791.&quot;

<text>William T. Anderson (c. 1840October 26, 1864), known by the nickname &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson, was a soldier who was one of the deadliest and most notorious Confederate guerrilla leaders in the American Civil War. Anderson led a band of volunteer partisan raiders who targeted Union loyalists and federal soldiers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. 

Raised by a family of Southerners in Kansas, Anderson began to support himself by stealing and selling horses in 1862. After a former friend and secessionist turned Union loyalist judge killed his father, Anderson killed the judge and fled to Missouri. There he robbed travelers and killed several Union soldiers. In early 1863 he joined Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders, a group of Confederate guerrillas which operated along the Kansas–Missouri border. He became a skilled bushwhacker, earning the trust of the group&#x27;s leaders, William Quantrill and George M. Todd. Anderson&#x27;s bushwhacking marked him as a dangerous man and eventually led the Union to imprison his sisters. After a building collapse in the makeshift jail in Kansas City, Missouri killed one sister, and left another permanently maimed, Anderson devoted himself to revenge. He took a leading role in the Lawrence Massacre and later took part in the Battle of Baxter Springs, both in 1863.

In late 1863, while Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders spent the winter in Sherman, Texas, animosity developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter&#x27;s arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri as the leader of his own group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, robbing and killing a large number of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate supporters in Missouri saw his actions as justifiable. In September 1864, Anderson led a raid on the town of Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, his men were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In what became known as the Centralia Massacre, Anderson&#x27;s bushwhackers killed 24 unarmed Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day which killed over a hundred Union soldiers. Anderson himself was killed a month later in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson; some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, while others put his actions into the perspective of the general desperation and lawlessness of the time and the brutalization effect of war.

==Early life==

William T. Anderson was born around 1840 in Hopkins County, Kentucky, to William C. and Martha Anderson. His siblings were Jim, Ellis, Mary Ellen, Josephine and Janie. His schoolmates recalled him as a well-behaved, reserved child. During his childhood, Anderson&#x27;s family moved to Huntsville, Missouri, where his father found employment on a farm and the family became well-respected. In 1857, they relocated to the Kansas Territory, traveling southwest on the Santa Fe Trail and settling east of Council Grove. The Anderson family supported slavery, though they did not own slaves. Their move to Kansas was likely for economic rather than political reasons. Kansas was at the time embroiled in an ideological conflict regarding its admission to the Union as slave or free, and both pro-slavery activists and abolitionists had moved there in attempts to influence its ultimate status. Animosity and violence between the two sides quickly developed in what was called Bleeding Kansas, but there was little unrest in the Council Grove area. After settling there, the Anderson family became friends with A.I. Baker, a local judge who was a Confederate sympathizer. By 1860, the young William T. Anderson was a joint owner of a property that was worth $500; his family had a total net worth of around $1,000. On June 28, 1860, William&#x27;s mother, Martha Anderson, died after being struck by lightning.

In the late 1850s, Ellis Anderson fled to Iowa after killing a Native American. Around the same time, William T. Anderson fatally shot a member of the Kaw tribe outside Council Grove; he claimed that the man had tried to rob him. He joined the freight shipping operation for which his father worked and was given a position known as &quot;second boss&quot; for a wagon trip to New Mexico. The trip was not successful and he returned to Missouri without the shipment, saying his horses had disappeared with the cargo. After he returned to Council Grove he began horse trading, taking horses from towns in Kansas, transporting them to Missouri and returning with more horses.

==Horse trading and outlawry==

After the Civil War began in 1861, the demand for horses increased and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them as far away as New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail. In late 1861, Anderson traveled south with Jim and Judge Baker in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army. Anderson had told a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons rather than out of loyalty to the Confederacy. However, the group was attacked by the Union&#x27;s 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri; the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas. The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing loyalty to the Union. One way he sought to prove that loyalty was by severing his ties with Anderson&#x27;s sister Mary, his former lover.

Upon his return to Kansas, Anderson continued horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862, Judge Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront the elder William Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker&#x27;s involvement particularly infuriating. The next day, the elder Anderson traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. The younger Anderson buried his father and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to a problem with the warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing he would be lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge&#x27;s claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves.

On July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson returned to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker&#x27;s house claiming to be a traveler seeking supplies. Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store&#x27;s basement. The Andersons barricaded the door to the basement and set the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law. They also burnt Baker&#x27;s home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail.

William and Jim Anderson soon formed a gang with a man named Bill Reed; in February 1863, the &quot;Lexington Weekly Union&quot; recorded that Reed was the leader of the gang. William Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla leader, later claimed to have encountered Reed&#x27;s company in July and rebuked them for robbing Confederate sympathizers; in their biography of Anderson, Albert Castel and Tom Goodrich speculate that this rebuke may have resulted in a deep resentment of Quantrill by Anderson. Anderson and his gang subsequently traveled east of Jackson County, Missouri, avoiding territory where Quantrill operated and continuing to support themselves by robbery. They also attacked Union soldiers, killing seven by early 1863.

==Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders==

Missouri had a large Union presence throughout the Civil War, but was also inhabited by many civilians whose sympathies lay with the Confederacy. From July 1861 until the end of the war, the state suffered up to 25,000 deaths from guerrilla warfare, more than any other state. Confederate General Sterling Price failed to gain control of Missouri in his 1861 offensive and retreated into Arkansas, leaving only partisan rangers and local guerrillas known as &quot;bushwhackers&quot; to challenge Union dominance. Quantrill was at the time the most prominent guerrilla leader in the Kansas–Missouri area. In early 1863, William and Jim Anderson traveled to Jackson County, Missouri, to join him. William Anderson was initially given a chilly reception from other raiders, who perceived him to be brash and overconfident.

In May 1863, Anderson joined members of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders on a foray near Council Grove, Kansas, in which they robbed a store west of the town. After the robbery, the group was intercepted by a United States Marshal accompanied by a large posse, about from the Kansas–Missouri border. In the resulting skirmish, several raiders were captured or killed and the rest of the guerrillas, including Anderson, split into small groups to return to Missouri. Castel and Goodrich speculated that this raid may have given Quantrill the idea of launching an attack deep in Kansas, as it demonstrated that the state&#x27;s border was poorly defended and that guerrillas could travel deep into the state&#x27;s interior before Union forces were alerted.

In early summer 1863, Anderson was made a lieutenant, serving in a unit led by George M. Todd. In June and July, Anderson took part in several raids that killed Union soldiers, in Westport, Kansas City and Lafayette County, Missouri. The first reference to Anderson in &quot;Official Records of the American Civil War&quot; concerns his activities at this time, describing him as the captain of a band of guerrillas. He commanded 30–40 men, one of whom was Archie Clement, an 18-year-old with a predilection for torture and mutilation who was loyal only to Anderson. By late July, Anderson led groups of guerrillas on raids and was often pursued by Union volunteer cavalry. Anderson was under Quantrill&#x27;s command, but independently organized some attacks.

Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders had an extensive support network in Missouri that provided them with numerous hiding places. Biographer Larry Wood claimed that Anderson&#x27;s sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union-controlled territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr. attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson&#x27;s sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City with a number of other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson&#x27;s sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson&#x27;s motivation shifted after the death of his sister, arguing that killing then became his focus, and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that by then killing had become more than a means to an end for Anderson: it became an end in itself.

===Lawrence Massacre===


Although Quantrill had considered the idea of a raid on the pro-Union stronghold that was the town of Lawrence, Kansas before the building collapsed in Kansas City, the deaths convinced the guerrillas to make a bold strike. Quantrill attained near-unanimous consent to travel into Union territory to strike Lawrence. The guerrillas gathered at the Blackwater River in Johnson County, Missouri. Anderson was placed in charge of 40 men, of which he was perhaps the angriest and most motivated—his fellow guerrillas considered him one of the deadliest fighters there. On August 19, the group, which proved to be the most guerrillas under one commander in the war, began the trip to Lawrence. En route, some guerrillas robbed a Union supporter, but Anderson knew the man and reimbursed him.

Arriving in Lawrence on August 21, the guerrillas immediately killed a number of Union Army recruits and one of Anderson&#x27;s men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform (guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers). They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but taking care not to shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, only relenting when a woman pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson&#x27;s command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more than any of the other group. They left town at 9:00am after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.

==Texas==

Four days after the Lawrence Massacre, on August 25, 1863, General Ewing retaliated against the Confederate guerrillas by issuing General Order No.11, an evacuation order that evicted almost 20,000 people from four counties in rural western Missouri and burned many of their homes. The order was intended to undermine the guerrillas&#x27; support network in Missouri. On October 2, a group of 450 guerrillas under Quantrill&#x27;s leadership met at Blackwater River in Jackson County and left for Texas.

They departed earlier in the year than they had planned, owing to increased Union pressure. En route, they entered Baxter Springs, Kansas, the site of Fort Blair. They attacked the fort on October 6, but the 90 Union troops there quickly took refuge inside, suffering minimal losses. Shortly after the initial assault, a larger group of Union troops approached Fort Blair, unaware the fort had been attacked and that the men they saw outside the fort dressed in Union uniforms were actually disguised guerrillas. The guerrillas charged the Union forces, killing about 100. Anderson and his men were in the rear of the charge, but gathered a large amount of plunder from the dead soldiers, irritating some guerrillas from the front line of the charge. Not satisfied with the number killed, Anderson and Todd wished to attack the fort again, but Quantrill considered another attack too risky. He angered Anderson by ordering his forces to withdraw.

On October 12, Quantrill and his men met General Samuel Cooper at the Canadian River and proceeded to Mineral Springs, Texas, to rest for the winter. During the winter, Anderson married Bush Smith, a woman from Sherman, Texas. Anderson ignored Quantrill&#x27;s request to wait until after the war and a dispute erupted, which resulted in Anderson separating his men from Quantrill&#x27;s band. The tension between the two groups markedly increased—some feared open warfare would result—but by the time of the wedding, relations had improved. In March 1864, at the behest of General Sterling Price, Quantrill reassembled his men, sending most of them into active duty with the regular Confederate Army. He retained 84 men and reunited with Anderson. Quantrill appointed him a first lieutenant, subordinate only to himself and to Todd.

A short time later, one of Anderson&#x27;s men was accused of stealing from one of Quantrill&#x27;s men. Quantrill expelled him and warned him not to come back, and the man was fatally shot by some of Quantrill&#x27;s men when he attempted to return. It is likely that this incident angered Anderson, who then took 20 men to visit the town of Sherman. They told General Cooper that Quantrill was responsible for the death of a Confederate officer; the general had Quantrill arrested. Sutherland described Anderson&#x27;s betrayal of Quantrill as a &quot;Judas&quot; turn. Quantrill was taken into custody but soon escaped. Anderson was told to recapture him and gave chase, but he was unable to locate his former commander and stopped at a creek. There, his men briefly engaged a group of guerrillas loyal to Quantrill, but no one was injured in the confrontation. Upon returning to the Confederate leadership, Anderson was commissioned as a captain by General Price.

==Return to Missouri==

Anderson and his men rested in Texas for several months before returning to Missouri. Although he learned that Union General Egbert B. Brown had devoted significant attention to the border area, Anderson led raids in Cooper County and Johnson County, Missouri, robbing local residents. On June 12, 1864, Anderson and 50 of his men engaged 15 members of the Missouri State Militia, killing and robbing 12. After the attack, one of Anderson&#x27;s guerrillas scalped a dead militiaman. The next day, in southeast Jackson County, Anderson&#x27;s group ambushed a wagon train carrying members of the Union 1st Northeast Missouri Cavalry, killing nine. The attacks prompted the &quot;Kansas City Daily Journal of Commerce&quot; to declare that rebels had taken over the area. Anderson and his men dressed as Union soldiers, wearing uniforms taken from those they killed. In response, Union militias developed hand signals to verify that approaching men in Union uniforms were not guerrillas. The guerrillas, however, quickly learned the signals, and local citizens became wary of Union troops, fearing that they were disguised guerrillas.

On July 6, a Confederate sympathizer brought Anderson newspapers containing articles about him. Anderson was upset by the critical tone of the coverage and sent letters to the publications. In the letters, Anderson took an arrogant and threatening yet playful tone, boasting of his attacks. He protested the execution of guerrillas and their sympathizers, and threatened to attack Lexington, Missouri. He concluded the letters by describing himself as the commander of &quot;Kansas First Guerrillas&quot; and requesting that local newspapers publish his replies. The letters were given to Union generals and were not published for 20 years.

In early July, Anderson&#x27;s group robbed and killed several Union sympathizers in Carroll and Randolph counties. On July 15, Anderson and his men entered Huntsville, Missouri and occupied the town&#x27;s business district. Anderson killed one hotel guest whom he suspected was a U.S. Marshal, but spoke amicably with an acquaintance he found there. Anderson&#x27;s men robbed the town&#x27;s depository, gaining about $40,000 () in the robbery, although Anderson returned some money to the friend he had met at the hotel.

===Growing infamy===

In June 1864, George M. Todd usurped Quantrill&#x27;s leadership of their group and forced him to leave the area. Todd rested his men in July to allow them to prepare for a Confederate invasion of Missouri. As Quantrill and Todd became less active, &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson emerged as the best-known, and most feared, Confederate guerrilla in Missouri. By August, the &quot;St. Joseph Herald&quot;, a Missouri newspaper, was describing him as &quot;the Devil&quot;. As Anderson&#x27;s profile increased, he was able to recruit more guerrillas. Anderson was selective, turning away all but the fiercest applicants, as he sought fighters similar to himself. His fearsome reputation gave a fillip to his recruiting efforts. Jesse James and his brother Frank were among the Missourians who joined Anderson; both of them later became notorious outlaws. General Clinton B. Fisk ordered his men to find and kill Anderson, but they were thwarted by Anderson&#x27;s support network and his forces&#x27; superior training and arms. Many militia members had been conscripted and lacked the guerrillas&#x27; boldness and resolve. In 1863, most Union troops left Missouri and only four regiments remained there. These regiments were composed of troops from out of state, who sometimes mistreated local residents, further motivating the guerrillas and their supporters. The Union militias sometimes rode slower horses and may have been intimidated by Anderson&#x27;s reputation.

On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing stores and tearing down telegraph wires on the way. They had hoped to attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town and took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot the Union horses before reinforcements arrived; three of Anderson&#x27;s men were killed in the confrontation. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers and 650 other men after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia&#x27;s commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man&#x27;s son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson and some of his men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, saying such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men they killed.

In early August, Anderson and his men traveled to Clay County. Around that time, he received further media coverage: the &quot;St. Joseph Morning Herald&quot; deemed him a &quot;heartless scoundrel&quot;, publishing an account of his torture of a captured Union soldier. On August 10, while traveling through Clay County, Anderson and his men engaged 25 militia members, killing five of them and forcing the rest to flee. After hearing of the engagement, General Fisk commanded a colonel to lead a party with the sole aim of killing Anderson.

===Missouri River and Fayette===

On August 13, Anderson and his men traveled through Ray County, Missouri, to the Missouri River, where they engaged Union militia. Although they forced the Union soldiers to flee, Anderson and Jesse James were injured in the encounter and the guerrillas retired to Boone County to rest. On August 27, Union soldiers killed at least three of Anderson&#x27;s men in an engagement near Rocheport. The next day, the 4th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry pursued them, but Anderson launched an ambush that killed seven Union soldiers. Anderson&#x27;s men mutilated the bodies, earning the guerrillas the description of &quot;incarnate fiends&quot; from the &quot;Columbia Missouri Statesman&quot;. On August 30, Anderson and his men attacked a steamboat on the Missouri River, killing the captain and gaining control of the boat. They used it to attack other boats, bringing river traffic to a virtual halt. In mid-September, Union soldiers ambushed two of Anderson&#x27;s parties traveling through Howard County, killing five men in one day. They found the guerrillas&#x27; horses decorated with the scalps of Union soldiers. A short time later, another six of Anderson&#x27;s men were ambushed and killed by Union troops; after learning of these events, Anderson was outraged and left the area to seek revenge.

Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; although they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together again. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion as they approached the town, even though it had received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry garrisoned in the town quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.

On September 26, Anderson and his men reached Monroe County, Missouri, and traveled towards Paris, but learned of other nearby guerrillas and rendezvoused with them near Audrain County. Anderson and his men camped with at least 300 men, including Todd. Although a large group of guerrillas was assembled, their leaders felt there were no promising targets to attack because all of the large towns nearby were heavily guarded.

==Raid on Centralia==

On the morning of September 27, 1864, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at the small town of Centralia and proceeded to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of whiskey and all began drinking. Anderson retreated into the lobby of the town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson&#x27;s men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists and hid their identities from the guerrillas. As the guerrillas robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. The guerrillas blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson&#x27;s men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty, unarmed Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war.

Anderson ordered his men not to harass the women on the train, but the guerrillas robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 () and taking the soldiers&#x27; uniforms. Anderson forced the captured Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep one for a prisoner exchange but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson&#x27;s men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted to the congressman&#x27;s presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson&#x27;s band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.

===Battle with Union soldiers===

Anderson arrived at the guerrilla camp and described the day&#x27;s events, the brutality of which unsettled Todd. By mid-afternoon, the 39th Missouri Volunteer Infantry had arrived in Centralia. From the town, they saw a group of about 120 guerrillas and pursued them. The guerrillas heard that the cavalry was approaching, and Anderson sent a party to set an ambush. They drew the Union troops to the top of a hill; a group of guerrillas led by Anderson had been stationed at the bottom and other guerrillas hid nearby. Anderson then led a charge up the hill. Although five guerrillas were killed by the first volley of Union fire, the Union soldiers were quickly overwhelmed by the well-armed guerrillas, and those who fled were pursued. One Union officer reached Centralia and gave word of the ambush, allowing a few Union soldiers who had remained there to escape. However, most were hunted down and killed. Anderson&#x27;s men mutilated the bodies of the dead soldiers and tortured some survivors.

By the end of the day, Anderson&#x27;s men had killed 22 soldiers from the train and 125 soldiers in the ensuing battle in one of the most decisive guerrilla victories of the entire war. It was Anderson&#x27;s greatest victory, surpassing Lawrence and Baxter Springs in brutality and the number of casualties. The attack led to a near-complete halt in rail traffic in the area and a dramatic increase in Union rail security. Anderson achieved the same notoriety Quantrill had previously enjoyed, and he began to refer to himself as &quot;Colonel Anderson&quot;, partly in an effort to supplant Quantrill. Sutherland saw the massacre as the last battle in the worst phase of the war in Missouri, and Castel and Goodrich described the slaughter as the Civil War&#x27;s &quot;epitome of savagery&quot;. However, Frank James, who participated in the attack, later defended the guerrillas&#x27; actions, arguing that the federal troops were marching under a black flag, indicating that they intended to show no mercy.

===Aftermath===

Anderson left the Centralia area on September 27, pursued for the first time by Union forces equipped with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the massacre, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.

Anderson visited Confederate sympathizers as he traveled, some of whom viewed him as a hero for fighting the Union, whom they deeply hated. Many of Anderson&#x27;s men also despised the Union, and he was adept at tapping into this emotion. The Union soldier held captive at Centralia was impressed with the control Anderson exercised over his men. Although many of them wished to execute this Union hostage, Anderson refused to allow it. On October 6, Anderson and his men began travelling to meet General Price in Boonville, Missouri; they arrived and met the general on October 11. Price was disgusted that Anderson used scalps to decorate his horse, and would not speak with him until he removed them. He was, however, impressed by the effectiveness of Anderson&#x27;s attacks. Anderson presented him with a gift of fine Union pistols, likely captured at Centralia. Price instructed Anderson to travel to the Missouri railroad and disrupt rail traffic, making Anderson a &quot;de facto&quot; Confederate captain.

Anderson traveled east with 80 men to New Florence, Missouri. The group then traveled west, disregarding the mission assigned by General Price in favor of looting. Anderson reached a Confederate Army camp; although he hoped to kill some injured Union prisoners there, he was prevented from doing so by camp doctors. After Confederate forces under General Joseph O. Shelby conquered Glasgow, Anderson traveled to the city to loot. He visited the house of a well-known Union sympathizer, the wealthiest resident of the town, brutally beat him, and raped his 12- or 13-year-old black servant. Anderson indicated that he was particularly angry that the man had freed his slaves, then trampled him with a specially trained horse. Local residents gathered $5,000, which they gave to Anderson; he then released the man, who died of his injuries in 1866. Anderson killed several other Union loyalists and some of his men returned to the wealthy resident&#x27;s house to rape more of his female servants. He left the area with 150 men.

==Death==

Union military leaders assigned Lieutenant Colonel Samuel P. Cox to kill Anderson, providing him with a group of experienced soldiers. Soon after Anderson left Glasgow, a local woman saw him and told Cox of his presence. On October 26, 1864, he pursued Anderson&#x27;s group with 150 men and engaged them in a battle called the Skirmish at Albany, Missouri. Anderson and his men charged the Union forces, killing five or six of them, but turned back under heavy fire. Only Anderson and one other man, the son of a Confederate general, continued to charge after the others had retreated. Anderson was hit by a bullet behind an ear, likely killing him instantly. Four other guerrillas were killed in the attack. The victory made a hero of Cox and led to his promotion.
Union soldiers identified Anderson by a letter found in his pocket and paraded his body through the streets of Richmond, Missouri. The corpse was photographed and displayed at a local courthouse for public viewing, along with Anderson&#x27;s possessions. Union soldiers claimed that Anderson was found with a string that had 53 knots, symbolizing each person he had killed. They also found his flag, and one soldier described it as &quot;... a small affair, made of fine silk, and the corner piece containing seven silver stars. On one side was -written in ink: &quot; Presented to W. T. Anderson, by his friend, A. R. T.,&quot; and on the other side: &quot;Do not let this be contaminated by Federal hands.&quot; Union soldiers buried Anderson&#x27;s body in a field near Richmond in a fairly well-built coffin. Some of them cut off one of his fingers to steal a ring. Flowers were placed at his grave, to the chagrin of Union soldiers. In 1908, Cole Younger, a former guerrilla who served under Quantrill, reburied Anderson&#x27;s body in the Old Pioneer Cemetery in Richmond, Missouri. In 1967, a memorial stone was placed at the grave.

Archie Clement led the guerrillas after Anderson&#x27;s death, but the group splintered by mid-November. Most Confederate guerrillas had lost heart by then, owing to a cold winter and the simultaneous failure of General Price&#x27;s 1864 invasion of Missouri, which ensured the state would remain securely under Union control for the rest of the war. As the Confederacy collapsed, most of Anderson&#x27;s men joined Quantrill&#x27;s forces or traveled to Texas. Jim Anderson moved to Sherman, Texas, with his two sisters.

==Legacy==

After the war, information about Anderson initially spread through memoirs of Civil War combatants and works by amateur historians. He was later discussed in biographies of Quantrill, which typically cast Anderson as an inveterate murderer. Three biographies of Anderson were written after 1975. Asa Earl Carter&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot; (1972) features Anderson as a main character. In 1976, the book was adapted into a film, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, which portrays a man who joins Anderson&#x27;s gang after his wife is killed by Union-backed raiders. James Carlos Blake&#x27;s novel &quot;Wildwood Boys&quot; (2000) is a fictional biography of Anderson. He also appears as a character in several films about Jesse James.

Historians have been mixed in their appraisal of Anderson. Wood describes him as the &quot;bloodiest man in America&#x27;s deadliest war&quot; and characterizes him as the clearest example of the war&#x27;s &quot;dehumanizing influence&quot;. Castel and Goodrich view Anderson as one of the war&#x27;s most savage and bitter combatants, but they also argue that the war made savages of many others. According to journalist T.J. Stiles, Anderson was not necessarily a &quot;sadistic fiend&quot;, but illustrated how young men became part of a &quot;culture of atrocity&quot; during the war. He maintains that Anderson&#x27;s acts were seen as particularly shocking in part because his cruelty was directed towards white Americans of equivalent social standing, rather than targets deemed acceptable by American society, such as Native Americans or foreigners.

In a study of 19th-century warfare, historian James Reid posited that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks of the Ottoman Army and Anderson&#x27;s guerrillas, arguing that they behaved similarly.

Anderson is loosely portrayed by Jim Caviezel as “Black John Ambrose” in the 1999 Ang Lee film &quot;Ride With The Devil&quot;.

<text>John Davies ( – 1644) was one of the leading scholars of the late Renaissance in Wales. He wrote a Welsh grammar and dictionary. He was also a translator and editor and an ordained minister of the Church of England. His name is traditionally associated with the parish of Mallwyd, Gwynedd, where he was rector from 1604 until his death in 1644.

Born in Llanferres, Denbighshire, the son of a weaver, he graduated from Jesus College, Oxford in 1594. He is believed to have been the main editor and reviser of the 1620 edition of the Welsh translation of the Bible and the 1621 edition of the Welsh translation of the Book of Common Prayer.

He published a Welsh grammar in Latin in 1621, &quot;Antiquae linguae Britannicae ...&quot;, and a Welsh–Latin Latin–Welsh dictionary in 1632, &quot;Antiquae linguae Britannicae ... et linguae Latinae dictionarium duplex&quot;. In 1632 he also published , a masterly translation and Protestant adaptation of (1582) by English Roman Catholic Robert Parsons.

He died, possibly while at Harlech, on 15 May 1644, and was buried at Mallwyd church, where a memorial was erected to him on the 200th anniversary of his death.

<text>Saint-Péray () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the northern Rhône wine region of France. Located in the southernmost part of Northern Rhône, the appellation is very small and not widely known. The production is mainly white sparkling wine, somewhat like Champagne. However, some still wine is also made. All Saint-Péray wine is white.

==History==
Pliny mentions the wine of Saint-Péray in his &quot;Natural History&quot;, and Napoleon Bonaparte is to have said that he, when he was a young cadet in Valence, had his first experience of wine, drinking Saint-Péray. In the wine&#x27;s prime in the 19th century, its sparkling wine was held in higher regard than Champagne itself, but since then it&#x27;s been down hill for the appellation. It was established as an official appellation in 1936 by which time it had shrunk to the meager 55 hectares.

==Grapes and wine==
There are two allowed grapes in Saint-Péray, Marsanne and Roussanne, with the former covering 90% of the planted area. A third grape &quot;Roussette&quot; is alleged to also be grown, but apparently only the wine growers themselves distinguish this from Roussanne.

===Winemaking===
Saint-Péray wines are meant to be drunk young, with 4/5 of the production being sparkling wine after the &quot;Methode Champenoise&quot;. However, advances are being made with still wine.

===Saint-Péray Mousseux AOC===
Saint-Péray Mousseaux is a wine-growing AOC in the northern Rhône wine region of France. The wines are exclusively white sparkling wines, made from the Marsanne and Roussanne grapes. Still wines from the same region and grapes are made under the appellation Saint-Péray AOC.

<text>Hugo Stumberg Kołłątaj, also spelled &quot;Kołłątay&quot; (1 April 1750 – 28 February 1812), was a prominent Polish constitutional reformer and educationalist, and one of the most prominent figures of the Polish Enlightenment. He served as Deputy Chancellor of the Crown between 1791–92. He was a Catholic priest, social and political activist, political thinker, historian, philosopher, and polymath.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hugo Kołłątaj was born on 1 April 1750 in Dederkały Wielkie (now in Western Ukraine) in Volhynia into a family of Polish nobility. Soon after, his family moved to Nieciesławice, near Sandomierz, where he spent his childhood. He attended school in Pińczów. He began his studies at the Kraków Academy, subsequently, Jagiellonian University, where he studied law and gained a doctorate. Afterwards, around 1775 he took holy orders. He studied in Vienna and Italy (Naples and Rome), where he would have encountered Enlightenment philosophy. He is thought to have gained two further doctorates abroad in philosophy and theology.

Returning to Poland, he became a canon of Kraków, and parish priest of Krzyżanowice Dolne and Tuczępy. He was active in the Commission of National Education and the Society for Elementary Books, where he took a prominent role in the development of the national network of schools. He spent two years in Warsaw, but returned to Kraków where he reformed the Kraków Academy, on whose board he sat from 1777, and whose rector he was between 1783–1786. The reform of the Academy was very substantial. It established innovative standards. Notably, he substituted Polish for Latin which till then was used for lectures. The removal of Latin in favour of a national language in higher education was then still uncommon in Europe. The reform proved so controversial that his political enemies plotted successfully to have him temporarily removed from Kraków in 1781, on grounds of corruption and immorality. Although in 1782 the decision was rescinded.

===Reforms of the Great Sejm===

Kołłątaj was also active politically. In 1786 he assumed the office of the Referendary of Lithuania, and moved to Warsaw. He became prominent in the reform movement, heading an informal group that was on the radical wing of the Patriotic Party, and labelled by their political enemies as &quot;Kołłątaj&#x27;s Forge&quot;. As leader of the Patriotic Party during the Great Sejm, he set out its programme in his &quot;Several Anonymous Letters to Stanisław Małachowski&quot; (1788–1789) and in his essay, &quot;The Political Law of the Polish Nation&quot; (1790). In his works he advocated a republican-tinged constitutional reform and the need for other social reforms. Among the goals he pursued were the strengthening of the king&#x27;s constitutional position, a larger national army, abolition of the liberum veto, the introduction of universal taxation, and the emancipation of both townspeople and the peasantry. An organizer of the townspeople&#x27;s movement, he edited a text that demanded reform and which was delivered to the king during the Black Procession of 1789.

Kołłątaj co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791. He also founded the Friends of the Constitution to assist in the document&#x27;s implementation. In 1786 he received the Order of Saint Stanislaus and in 1791, the Order of the White Eagle. In 1791–92 he served as Crown Vice Chancellor (Podkanclerzy Koronny).

During the Polish-Russian war that broke out over the 3 May Constitution, Kołłątaj, along with other royal advisers, persuaded King Stanisław August, himself a co-author of the Constitution, to seek a compromise with their opponents and to join the Targowica Confederation that had been formed to bring down the Constitution. However, in 1792, when the Confederates&#x27; won, Kołłątaj emigrated to Leipzig and Dresden, where in 1793 he wrote, with Ignacy Potocki, an essay entitled, &quot;On the Adoption and Fall of the Polish May 3 Constitution&quot;.

===Exile and final years===

In exile, his political views became more radical and he became involved with the preparation for an insurrection. In 1794 he took part in the Kościuszko Uprising, contributing to its &quot;Uprising Act&quot; on 24 March 1794 and to the Połaniec Manifesto on 7 May 1794. He headed the Supreme National Council&#x27;s Treasury Department, and backing the Uprising&#x27;s wing of Polish Jacobins. After the suppression of the Uprising in the same year, Kołłątaj was imprisoned by the Austrians until 1802. In 1805, with Tadeusz Czacki, he organized the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Volhynia. In 1807, after the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw, he was initially involved in its government, but was soon excluded from it through the intrigues of political opponents, and soon afterwards, was interned and imprisoned by the Russian authorities until 1808. On his release he found himself barred from public office. Despite that he sought to present a programme for rebuilding and developing Poland in his &quot;Remarks on the Present Position of That Part of the Polish Lands that, since the Treaty of Tilsit, have come to be called the Duchy of Warsaw&quot;, (1809). In 1809 he became a member of the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning. In the years 1809–1810 he was once again involved with the Kraków Academy, bringing it back from its temporarily Germanized form.
In his &quot;The Physico-Moral Order&quot; (1811), Kołłątaj sought to create a socio-ethical system emphasizing the equality of all people, based on the physiocratic idea of a &quot;physico-moral order&quot;. Steeped in the natural sciences, geology and mineralogy in particular, he went on to write &quot;A Critical Analysis of Historical Principles regarding the Origins of Humankind&quot;, published posthumously in 1842. In this work he put forward the first Polish presentation of ideas of social evolution based on geological concepts. This work is also seen as an important contribution to cultural anthropology. In &quot;The State of Education in Poland in the Final Years of the Reign of Augustus III&quot;, published posthumously in 1841, he argued against the Jesuit domination of education and presented a study of the history of education.

He died on 28 February 1812, &quot;forgotten and abandoned&quot; by his contemporaries. He was buried in the Powązki Cemetery.

==Remembrance==

Despite his lonely death, Kołłątaj became an influence on many subsequent reformers and is now recognized as one of the key figures of the Enlightenment in Poland, and &quot;one of the greatest minds of his epoch&quot;. He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting, &quot;Constitution of May 3, 1791.&quot;

Several learned institutions in Poland are named in Hugo Kołłątaj&#x27;s honour, including the Agricultural University of Cracow of which he was co-founder and patron.

<doc id="1126794" wikidata="Q618933" url="?curid=1126794" title="Apollo Applications Program">
<text>The Apollo Applications Program (AAP) was created as early as 1966 by NASA headquarters to develop science-based human spaceflight missions using hardware developed for the Apollo program. AAP was the ultimate development of a number of official and unofficial Apollo follow-on projects studied at various NASA labs. However, the AAP&#x27;s ambitious initial plans became an early casualty when the Johnson Administration declined to support it fully in order to remain within a $100 billion budget. Thus, Fiscal Year 1967 ultimately allocated $80 million to the AAP, compared to NASA&#x27;s preliminary estimates of $450 million necessary to fund a full-scale AAP program for that year, with over $1 billion being required for FY 1968. The AAP eventually led to Skylab, which absorbed much of what had been developed under Apollo Applications.

==Origins==
NASA management was concerned about losing the 400,000 workers involved in Apollo after landing on the Moon in 1969. Wernher von Braun, head of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center during the 1960s, advocated for a smaller space station (after his large one was not built) to provide his employees with work beyond developing the Saturn rockets, which would be completed relatively early during Project Apollo. NASA originally set up the Apollo Logistic Support System Office to study various ways to modify the Apollo hardware for scientific missions. The AAP office was initially an offshoot of the Apollo &quot;X&quot; bureau, also known as the Apollo Extension Series. AES was developing technology concepts for proposed missions based on the Saturn IB and Saturn V boosters. These included a crewed lunar base, an Earth-orbiting space station, the so-called Grand Tour of the Outer Solar System, and the original Voyager program of Mars Lander probes.

===AES (Apollo Extension Series) Lunar Base===

The Apollo lunar base proposal saw an uncrewed Saturn V used to land a shelter based on the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) on the Moon. A second Saturn V would carry a three-person crew and a modified CSM and Apollo Lunar Module (LM) to the Moon. The two-person excursion team would have a surface stay time of nearly 200 days and use of an advanced lunar rover and a lunar flier as well as logistics vehicles to construct a larger shelter. The isolation of the CSM pilot was a concern for mission planners, so proposals that it would be a three-person landing team or that the CSM would rendezvous with an orbiting module were considered.

====Evolution====
The following phases were considered:

*Phase 1: 1969-1971: This &quot;Apollo Phase&quot; commenced with the first lunar landing and continued for four missions, or until sufficient experience had been achieved to allow the next phase to commence. As actually flown by NASA, these missions corresponded to Apollo 11 to Apollo 14.
*Phase 2: 1972 to 1973: This Lunar Exploration Phase would commence about two years after Apollo and consisted of four flights of the Extended Lunar Module (ELM), a modification of basic Apollo Lunar Module hardware. ELM missions extended lunar stay time to 3 or 4 days with landed payloads approaching 450 kg. This scenario corresponded to Apollo 15 to Apollo 17 as flown.
*Phase 3: 1974: A single Lunar Orbital Survey Mission was indicated after the Lunar Surface Exploration phase and would be the end of the initial buy of Apollo spacecraft. This 28-day lunar polar orbit mission would be flown after the Apollos and ELMs, in order to have several &quot;ground-truth&quot; sites.
*Phase 4: 1975-1976: This Lunar Surface Rendezvous and Exploration Phase nominally consisted of two dual-launch missions. A Lunar Payload Module (LPM - essentially the LM Truck of earlier studies) would be delivered by an uncrewed cargo carrier to the surface and provide a rendezvous target for a crewed ELM that would arrive up to 3 months later. The Apollo LM Shelter was essentially an Apollo LM with ascent stage engine and fuel tanks removed and replaced with consumables and scientific equipment for 14 days&#x27; extended lunar exploration.

====Associated vehicles====
The Apollo LM Taxi was essentially the basic Apollo LM modified for extended lunar surface stays. This was expected to be the workhorse of both Apollo Applications Extended Lunar Surface Missions beginning in 1970 and to larger Lunar Exploration System for Apollo in the mid-to-late 1970s.

The Apollo LM Shelter was essentially an Apollo LM with ascent stage engine and fuel tanks removed and replaced with consumables and scientific equipment for 14 days&#x27; extended lunar exploration.

The MOBEV F2B was a multi-person surface-to-surface flying vehicle.

===LESA (Lunar Exploration System for Apollo) Lunar Base===
The basic Apollo hardware would evolve into AES (Apollo Extension Systems), followed by ALSS (Apollo Logistics Support System), and then LESA (Lunar Exploration System for Apollo). The result would be ever-expanding permanent stations on the Moon.

LESA (Lunar Exploration System for Apollo) represented the last lunar base concept studied by NASA prior to the cancellation of further Saturn V production. LESA would use a new Lunar Landing Vehicle to land payloads on the lunar surface and extended CSM and LM Taxi hardware derived from the basic Apollo program would allow crews to be rotated to the ever-expanding, and eventually permanent, lunar base. A nuclear reactor would provide power.

Phases:
* 2 men/2 days - Apollo
* 2 men/14 days - AES - LM Shelter (2050 kg surface payload - LEM Shelter)
* 2 men/14 to 30 days - ALSS with shelter or MOLAB (4100 kg surface payload)
* 2-3 men/14 to 30 days - ALSS with a LASSO shelter or larger MOLAB (7900 kg surface payload)
* 3 men/90 days - LESA I (10,500 kg surface payload)
* 3 men/90 days - LESA I + MOLAB (12,500 kg surface payload)
* 6 men/180 days - LESA II with shelter and extended-range roving vehicle (25,000 kg surface payload)

===Lunar Escape Systems===
To support longer stays on the Moon, NASA also studied Lunar Escape Systems as a means of returning two astronauts from the lunar surface to an orbiting CSM if the Lunar Module ascent-stage engine failed to ignite.

===Manned Venus Flyby===

Another plan for Apollo-based extended-duration crewed spaceflight would use a Saturn V to send three men on a Manned Venus Flyby, using the Saturn S-IVB stage as a &quot;wet workshop&quot;. First the S-IVB would boost itself and the Apollo CSM on a trajectory that would pass by Venus and return to Earth, then any remaining fuel would be vented to space, after which the astronauts would live in the empty fuel tanks until they separated from the S-IVB shortly before reentry on their return to Earth.

==Development==
When procurement of Saturn Vs other than those required for the lunar landing was stopped in 1968, focus shifted to AAP. Aside from attempting to show that Apollo presented value for money, NASA and the main contractors of Boeing, Grumman, North American Aviation and Rockwell also hoped to put off the inevitable scaling down of staff and facilities following the completion of the first Moon landing.

Three AAP proposals were selected for development:

* The Apollo Telescope Mission would be an Earth-orbiting mission for solar observation. The telescope would be based on a modified Lunar Module ascent stage, and launched using a S-IVB. The telescope would be docked to a CSM with a three-person crew. Solar panels on the telescope would provide additional power, allowing an extended mission of 21–28 days. The telescope module would include a pressurized compartment providing additional living and workspace for the crew.
* The Apollo Manned Survey Mission proposed an Earth-observation science module also based on the LM ascent stage, and would also have been launched using a S-IVB vehicle into a high-inclination orbit. It was also proposed that a surplus Saturn V would launch a crewed lunar survey mission to establish suitable sites for later crewed landings.
* The wet workshop space station concept provided for a low-budget Earth orbiting station. The original plan, as proposed by Wernher von Braun, used the S-II stage as the primary structure of the station, with the area normally filled by the S-IVB stage replaced with an equipment carrier. These plans were modified to use the S-IVB when Saturn V production ended with just enough boosters for the lunar missions alone.

In the meantime several of the Earth-orbit &quot;checkout&quot; missions for Apollo had been canceled, leaving a number of Saturn IBs unused. The plans were changed to use the S-IVB stage, used on both rockets, as the primary station structure. A modified S-IVB would be launched into orbit, the second stage carrying a docking module and large solar panels in the area normally carrying the LM. A CSM would then be able to dock with the second stage and enter the now-empty fuel tanks. It was also suggested that the Apollo Telescope and Survey Mission modules might be docked to the Wet Workshop to create a modular space station.

The &quot;Planetary Grand Tour&quot; was moved to the Mariner program as &quot;Mariner Jupiter-Saturn&quot;, which was later calved off into the Voyager program. Two probes were launched in 1977 on Titan IIIE rockets, with &quot;Voyager 2&quot; completing the full Grand Tour in 1989.

==Skylab==
Originally, AAP missions would alternate with Apollo lunar missions, starting in 1969. However, when NASA&#x27;s 1969 budget was cut, focus was shifted to the Skylab space station proposal, which managed to accommodate the equipment already specified for some of the AAP missions. Specifically, Skylab included the Apollo Telescope Mission (renamed the Apollo Telescope Mount) attached to the docking station used by the CSMs. Since the first two stages of the Saturn V had enough payload capability by themselves to place a pre-fabricated S-IVB workshop into the appropriate orbit, this enabled the &quot;dry workshop&quot; concept. This allowed the interior space to be better fitted out, although many design concepts from the &quot;wet&quot; workshop, notably the open flooring that allowed fuel to flow through it, were kept in Skylab.

The concept of launching another Skylab into lunar orbit using a spare S-IVB was briefly discussed around the same time, but no justification could be found for it, so the project was abandoned early on.

==Apollo-Soyuz Test Project==
The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project involved a docking in Earth orbit between a CSM and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. The mission lasted from July 15 to July 24, 1975. Although the Soviet Union continued to operate the Soyuz and Salyut space vehicles, NASA&#x27;s next crewed mission would not be until STS-1 on April 12, 1981.

<text>Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a 1939 romantic drama film starring Robert Donat, Greer Garson and directed by Sam Wood. Based on the 1934 novella of the same name by James Hilton, the film is about Mr. Chipping, a beloved aged school teacher and former headmaster of a boarding school, who recalls his career and his personal life over the decades. Produced for the British division of MGM at Denham Studios, the film was dedicated to Irving Thalberg, who died on 14 September 1936. At the 12th Academy Awards, it was nominated for seven awards, including Best Picture, and Donat, for his performance as Mr. Chipping, won the award for Best Actor.

At the time of its release, the picture appeared on &quot;Film Daily&quot;″s and the National Board of Review&#x27;s ten best lists for 1939 and received the &quot;best picture&quot; distinction in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Preview Poll of May 1939.

==Plot==
Due to a cold, retired schoolteacher Mr. Chipping misses a first-day assembly at Brookfield public school for the first time in 58 years. That afternoon, he falls asleep in his chair and his teaching career is related via flashback.

When 25-year-old Charles Edward Chipping first arrives as a Latin teacher in 1870, he becomes a target of practical jokes on his first day. He reacts by imposing strict discipline in his classroom, making him disliked but respected. Twenty years pass and he becomes the senior master. He is disappointed in not receiving an appointment as a housemaster within the school for the following year. However, the new German teacher, Max Staefel, saves him from despair by inviting him to share a walking holiday to his native Austria.

While mountain-climbing, Chipping encounters Kathy Ellis, a feisty English suffragette who is on a cycling holiday with a friend. They meet again in Vienna, where she persuades him to dance to the Blue Danube Waltz. (This piece of music is used as a &quot;leitmotif&quot;, symbolizing Chipping&#x27;s love for her.) Staefel remarks that the Danube does not appear blue, but Chipping remarks it only appears so to those who are in love. On another part of the same boat, as Kathy looks at the river, she tells her friend that it is blue. Even though Kathy is considerably younger and livelier than Chipping, she loves and marries him. They return to England, where Kathy takes up residence at the school, charming everyone with her warmth.

During their tragically short marriage (she dies in childbirth, along with their baby), she brings &quot;Chips&quot; out of his shell and shows him how to be a better teacher. He acquires a flair for Latin puns. As the years pass, Chips becomes a much-loved school institution, developing a rapport with generations of pupils; he teaches the sons and grandsons of many of his earlier pupils.

In 1909, when he is pressured to retire by a more &quot;modern&quot; headmaster, the boys and the board of governors of the school take his side of the argument and tell him he can stay until he is 100, and that he is free to pronounce Cicero as SIS-er-ro, and not as KEE-kir-ro.

Chips finally retires in 1914 at the age of 69, saying, &quot;Haec olim meminisse iuvabit&quot; (One day, we&#x27;ll look back on this and smile), but is summoned back to serve as interim headmaster because of the shortage of teachers resulting from the First World War. He remembers Kathy had predicted he would become headmaster one day. During a bombing attack by a German Zeppelin, Chips insists that the boys keep on translating their Latin, choosing the story of Julius Caesar&#x27;s battles against Germanic tribes, which describes the latter&#x27;s belligerent nature, much to the amusement of his pupils. As the Great War drags on, Chips reads aloud into the school&#x27;s Roll of Honour every Sunday the names of the many former boys and teachers who have died in the war. Upon discovering that Max Staefel has died fighting on the German side, Chips reads out his name in chapel, too.

He retires permanently in 1918 but continues living nearby. He is on his deathbed in 1933 when he overhears his colleagues talking about him. He responds, &quot;I thought I heard you say it was a pity—pity I never had any children. But you&#x27;re wrong. I have! Thousands of them, thousands of them...and all...boys.&quot;

==Cast==

==Acknowledgements==
The opening credits contain a card that reads: &quot;To Sidney Franklin...For his contribution in the preparation of the production...Grateful acknowledgement,&quot;

The opening credits also contain a dedication to Irving Thalberg, who died in September 1936. It reads:

&quot;We wish to acknowledge here our gratitude to the late Irving Thalberg, whose inspiration illuminates the picture of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;&quot;— James Hilton, Victor Saville, Sam Wood, Sidney A. Franklin, R. C. Sherriff, Claudine West, Eric Maschwitz

The AFI Catalog reports that Thalberg purchased &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; from galley proofs; he originally assigned Sidney Franklin to direct. After Franklin became an M-G-M producer, Sam Wood replaced him as director.

==Filming locations==
The exteriors of the buildings of the fictional Brookfield School were shot at Repton School, an independent school (at the time of filming, for boys only), in the village of Repton in Derbyshire; whilst the interiors, school courtyards and annexes, including the supposedly exterior shots of the Austrian Tyrol Mountains, were filmed at Denham Film Studios near the village of Denham in Buckinghamshire. Around 300 boys from Repton School—as well as members of the faculty—stayed on during the school holidays so they could appear in the film.

==Box office==
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,717,000 in the US and Canada and $1,535,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,305,000.

==Reception==
In May 1939, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Frank S. Nugent praised the film at length, particularly the adaptation and the performances of Donat and Garson, among others.

In December 1939, &quot;Variety&quot; summed up the film as &quot;a charming, quaintly sophisticated account [from the novel &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips!&quot; by James Hilton] of the life of a schoolteacher, highlighted by a remarkably fine performance from Robert Donat . . . The character he etches creates a bloodstream for the picture that keeps it intensely alive.”

&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; holds an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on twenty reviews. 

==Legacy==
The film was re-released in the United Kingdom in 1944 and again in 1954.

In 1999, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; was voted the 72nd greatest British film ever in the British Film Institute Top 100 British films poll.

In 2003, the American Film Institute ranked Mr. Chipping the 41st greatest film hero of all time.

On TCM.com, Leonard Maltin gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4.

==Academy Awards and nominations==
The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards: for Outstanding Production, Best Director, Actor, Actress, Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Film Editing, and Best Sound. It was up against &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in all seven categories; Robert Donat won for Best Actor, beating Laurence Olivier, Clark Gable and James Stewart, though &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; lost to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; in five of the six remaining categories, while &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; won Best Original Story. (Best Sound went to &quot;When Tomorrow Comes&quot;.)

==1969 remake==
&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; was remade as a musical in 1969, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole and Petula Clark. The James Hilton novel has also been adapted for television twice as serials in 1984 (starring Roy Marsden) and 2002 (starring Martin Clunes).

<text>Sport Vereniging Transvaal is a Surinamese association football club, which plays in the top of football in Suriname. They play their home games in Paramaribo at André Kamperveen Stadion to a capacity of 7,100.

The team is one of Suriname&#x27;s most successful, having won their first league championship in 1925, and having won a total of 19, good for second most in Suriname after Robinhood. Transvaal have also won the Beker van Suriname (Surinamese Cup) three times and the Suriname President&#x27;s Cup twice (1997 and 2008). The biggest international successes were in 1973 and 1981, both resulting in CONCACAF Champions Cup victories. To date, they are the only Surinamese club to win the Champions&#x27; Cup (now Champions League).

SV Tranvaal were appointed by the IFFHS, as one of the top ten football clubs in CONCACAF of the 20th century standing in fifth position.

Since the launch of professional football on February 22, 2024, S.V. Transvaal is competing in the professional Suriname Major League.

==History==

===Early years===

Founded on 15 January 1921 by Hendrik School students, a middle school in Paramaribo, Suriname, S.V. Transvaal is named after the former province of South Africa, Transvaal Province. It was founded in the same year as two other clubs from Paramaribo, namely Olympia and Ajax. The first three years prior to the foundation of organized football in Suriname, Transvaal played on the Gouvernementsplein in Paramaribo amongst various other clubs, competing in leagues of different associations. 1923 marked the official start of organized football in Suriname, with Transvaal starting in the Tweede Klasse (present day Eerste Klasse), the second flight of football in Suriname. 1923 also marked the inauguration of the Cultuurtuinlaan, the new football facility, built by Dr. E. Snellen, the director of agriculture in Suriname. Transvaal participated in the inaugural ceremony, where they beat Juliana in a 2–0 win. Transvaal remained tenants of the Cultuurtuinlaan for the next 30 years until completion of the National Stadium.

In 1924, Transvaal won their first title, winning the Tweede Klasse undefeated in its maiden season. The club were able to win all six matches played, earning 12 points in the competition, and scoring 16 goals while conceding none. It was the first time a team had gone undefeated or played a season without conceding any goals. Transvaal were subsequently promoted to the SVB Hoofdklasse, the top flight of football in Suriname, after only one season in the second tier.

In 1925, SV Transvaal won their second consecutive title and first national championship, winning the Hoofdklasse in its third season. After a period of dominance by Ajax and Cicerone, Transvaal won the title once more in 1937. That same year the SVB organized their first trip to Brazil, with Transvaal player Waldy Goedhart joining the national team to play exhibition matches against Tuna Luso, Paysandu and Remo.

On 28 March 1947 matches were played at night in Suriname for the first time, with light fixtures assembled at the Cultuurtuinlaan, the matches played on that night were NAKS vs. Robinhood at 19:00 and Transvaal vs. Paramaribo at 20:00. Key players of the forties and fifties include Tjokrosendjojo Kamsoe, Ronald Breinburg and Walther Braithwaite, who would later become manager of the club.

===Rise to dominance===
The 1960s marked a decade of success for Transvaal, winning 7 out of 10 titles beginning in 1962, only conceding the 1961 and 1963 titles to Leo Victor and the 1964 edition to Robinhood. The team was managed by André Kamperveen, one of the country&#x27;s most famous players and Transvaal&#x27;s most famous managers, who had taken over the position in 1958. In 1967 he was succeeded by Ronald Kolf who helped Transvaal to two national titles before relinquishing the position to Jules Lagadeau. Both Kolf and Lagadeau earned their stripes as players on the pitch prior to taking their respective managerial roles. Transvaal boasted some of the country&#x27;s best players at the time, with players such as Edwin Schal, Iwan Fränkel, Harald Reumel, Roy Vanenburg and Armand Sahadewsing.

====Matches against Brazilian clubs (1960–1967)====
Throughout the 1960s the SVB organized friendly tournaments and exhibition matches with the Suriname national team and invited clubs from Brazil to partake. Aside from the national team, clubs from the Hoofdklasse were invited to participate as well, including Transvaal, Robinhood and Leo Victor.

In 1962 Transvaal participated in the first edition of the Paramaribo Cup. They played Fortaleza, losing 2–1 to the visiting team from Brazil. On 10 April 1962 they played Santa Cruz from Brazil, losing 2–1 as well. The 1964 edition of the Paramaribo Cup saw Transvaal losing to visitors Botafogo from Brazil in a 4–1 loss. Apart from a 4–0 win against Olaria, Transvaal were unable to secure any wins in the series.

=====Match results=====










===1968: First trip to Europe===
In 1968, Transvaal travelled to Europe for the first time, scheduling games in the Netherlands and Belgium, against Dutch Eredivisie clubs Sparta, Ajax, Elinkwijk, AZ&#x27;67 and NAC, and against Belgian Pro League side Royal Antwerp. Transvaal were able to secure 4 wins, and 1 draw only losing to Ajax on their tour.

====Tour results====






===1968 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup===
In 1968, Transvaal participated in their first Continental tournament, qualifying for the 1968 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. The team were able to make it to the final in their first berth in the competition, defeating Scherpenheuvel from the Netherlands Antilles 4–2 on aggregate score and Aurora from Guatemala 3–1 on aggregate score in the process thus qualifying for the finals. The final against Toluca from Mexico however never happened due to a brawl that had ensued after the final match against Aurora when supporters from both clubs had invaded the pitch. Transvaal were disqualified for disorderly conduct.

In 1969, Flamengo from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil came to Paramaribo to play pre-season friendly matches against Robinhood and Transvaal at the National Stadium. Brazilian International Garrincha was playing for Flamengo at the time. While Robinhood lost the first match 3–1 to the visitors, Transvaal were able to secure a 3–2 win against the visiting team.

===1971: Pelé&#x27;s 1000th match===
On 27 January 1971, O Rei himself Pelé and Santos F.C. from Santos, São Paulo came to Suriname to play Transvaal at the National Stadion. The match on 28 January 1971 was of historic significance as it was the 1000th career match played by Pelé. The Transvaal line-up included Emile Barron, Nortan, Gesser, Sordam, Boschman, Lagadeau, Bundel, Vanenburg, Schal, Brammerloo and Klimsop, while Santos line-up for the match included Cejos.

----

In 1972, Edwin &#x27;Wiene&#x27; Schal became the first Transvaal player to be called up for the CONCACAF All-Star team, considered to be one of the top players in the confederation at the time.

===1973 Season: Highest accolades===
Showing steady improvement by each season, the 1973 season proved to be Transvaal&#x27;s most successful to date. Under guidance of Jules Lagadeau, Transvaal went on to win the national title undefeated also winning the country&#x27;s first ever CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup following the withdrawal of both Costa Rican clubs Alajuelense and Saprissa.

Accolades of the 1973 season include:
* Undefeated champions of the SVB Hoofdklasse.
* Undefeated champions in the SVB Junior League (youth team).
* Undefeated champions in the Sterrentoernooi (English, Stars Tournament).
* Undefeated champions of the Caribbean region (CFU).
* Undefeated winners of the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.
* Edwin &#x27;Wiene&#x27; Schal finished as top scorer of the Hoofdklasse with 20 goals.
* Dennis van la Parra finished as top scorer of the Junior League.

The manager of the club in 1973 was Jules Lagadeau. To this date no club in Suriname have been able to match the success of Transvaal in the 1973 season.

===1981 Season: The Golden Age===

By 1981, Transvaal had become one of the most successful sides in Surinamese football. They had amassed 14 league titles already and held the only CONCACAF Champions League win for a Surinamese side back in 1971. With this season they would add their most recent international triumph over none other than Atlético Marte of El Salvador.

The 1981 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup final took place in the city of Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname. According to former players, the onset of civil war in El Salvador was the reason CONCACAF decided to hold both games in the Andre Kamperveen Stadion in Suriname.

The first game was played with great difficulty. &quot;The lawn was ugly [for lack of rain] and affected both teams,&quot; says Wensley Bundel, a midfielder who played in both games.

&quot;Atlético Marte wanted to play short passes, but could not, so we took advantage of them,&quot; he said.

Wensley Bundel scored for Transvaal in the first game, which ended in 1–1 draw. Regarding the shot, he said, &quot;It was a free kick. I remember that was barely hit the mark, but I gave it my all and I think [the] goalie is still looking for where the ball went.&quot;

For the second game, Johan Leisberger scored the winner. Transvaal played quick and fast and it paid off with raising the trophy under guidance of coach Humbert Boerleider. Thanks to an excellent performance, striker Theo Klein was hailed as the man of the match and was awarded player of the year in Suriname as well. Wensley Bundel to have won both CONCACAF titles with Transvaal.

There is a rumor amongst supporters of the club, that Transvaal actually defeated Cruz Azul from Mexico in the 1970 edition of the cup. This is not a known fact, but should this be the case then Bundel was the only player to have played in all three cup matches.

The Transvaal Lineup 1981:

* Emile Barron (GK)
* Jules Lagadeau (DF)
* Edwin Schal (DF)
* Remie Olmberg (DF)
* Harald Brammerloo (DF)
* Wensley Bundel (MF)
* Johan Leisberger (MF)
* Roy Vanenburg (MF)
* Wong Sai Sang (MF)
* Pauli Corte (FW)
* Theo Klein (FW)
* Humbert Boerleider Coach

===1986 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup===
In 1986, Transvaal made it to the finals of the Continental tournament for the fourth time. By defeating SV Juventus (Netherlands Antilles), UNDEBA (Netherlands Antilles) and rivals Robinhood (Suriname), thus clinching the Caribbean region, Transvaal then defeated Trintoc (Trinidad and Tobago) in the semi-final to face Alajuelense (Costa Rica) in the final. Losing the series 4–2 on aggregate score, it would be the fourth time the two clubs would be drawn together in the history of the tournament.

===1990–2000s and the end of an era===

Although Transvaal were unable to proceed past the rounds of the Caribbean region in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup during the nineties, the club did win five national titles in the decade, winning the Hoofdklasse in 1990, 1991, 1996, 1997 and 2000. The closest Transvaal came to advancing in the Continental tournament was a 10–0 aggregate defeat against the Seattle Sounders in the USA/Caribbean playoff round introduced to the tournament that year. The loss against the team from Seattle marked the end of Transvaal&#x27;s firm presence within the tournament, having suffered an unprecedented loss.

A year later a new format to the tournament was introduced as well as the CFU Club Championship. Transvaal failed to advance past the first group stage of the tournament. They qualified for the 2001 edition but were forced to withdraw due to complications in their domestic league which saw no matches contested that year.

===New ownership, new coaches 2015-present===
After witnessing how Transvaal almost got relegated to the Eerste Klasse in the 2014–15 season, many wondered if Transie would rise to dominance again.

On 22 December 2015, Rudisa bought the club and in 2016 appointed Dennis Baino as head coach. The new owner and manager brought some changes to the club, such as training players four times a week. At the end of the 2016 season, Transie ended in second and punched a ticket to the CFU Club Championship, for the first time in 20 years.

On 29 January 2017, the board of Transvaal decided to replace Baino, after eight games played in the new Topklasse league, because he failed to keep the club in mid table. Two days later the board appointed Baino&#x27;s assistant, Raymond Mannen as the new head coach. The next day Transie played against SNL under the new manager and won the match with two goals to one.

In September 2019 Transvaal signed a 3-year contract with trainer Kenneth Jaliens. Jaliens is considered to be the most educated trainer from Suriname and his objective is to bring back the glory from the old days that this club has seen.
==Stadium==

Transvaal play their home matches at the André Kamperveen Stadion (&quot;formerly known as the National Stadion&quot;) in Paramaribo to a capacity of 7,100 people. They share the stadium with the Suriname national team. Transvaal have been tenants of the AK Stadium since construction was completed in 1953. Prior to the National Stadium, Transvaal played their home games on the Cultuurtuinlaan, across the street from where the stadium sits today. From 1953 to 2014, Transvaal shared the stadium with rivals S.V. Robinhood, before they suffered relegation in 2014, moving to the Frank Essed Stadion, together with S.V. Walking Boyz Company who had played at the Kamperveen stadium since 1997.

===Youth stadium===

Due to the high volume of activity at the clubs&#x27; home stadium, a result of the stadium being shared with the Surinamese athletics and cycling associations, a new stadium was erected in 1966 to serve as the training grounds for the youth teams of various clubs around Paramaribo. Transvaal were amongst the first tenants of the George W. Streepy Stadion, which serves as additional training facilities, as well as being the official stadium for the SVB Junior League, the youth league of the Surinamese Football Association.

==Crest and colors==
The club colors are green and white and the team is named after the former province of South Africa, Transvaal Province. The badge white and green stripes with &#x27;S.V. Transvaal&#x27; written across the shield from the bottom left to the top right. There is also a football in the top left corner of the badge. The club&#x27;s playing kits are always a combination of green and white. Having had varying patterns over the years, including shirt stripes and patches, the typical outfit warn is white for home and green for away colors, which are two of the national colors of Suriname.

<doc id="1126811" wikidata="Q205456" url="?curid=1126811" title="Theo van Gogh (film director)">
<text>Theodoor &quot;Theo&quot; van Gogh (; 23 July 1957 – 2 November 2004) was a Dutch film director. He directed &quot;Submission: Part 1&quot;, a short film written by Somali writer and politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which criticised the treatment of women in Islam in strong terms. On 2 November 2004, he was murdered by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch-Moroccan Islamist who objected to the film&#x27;s message. The last film Van Gogh had completed before his murder, &quot;06/05&quot;, was a fictional exploration of the assassination of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn. It was released posthumously in December 2004, a month after Van Gogh&#x27;s death, and two years after Fortuyn&#x27;s death.

== Early life ==
Theodoor van Gogh was born on 23 July 1957 in The Hague to Anneke and Johan van Gogh. His father served in the Dutch secret service (AIVD, then called BVD). He was named after his paternal uncle Theo, who was captured and executed while working as a resistance fighter during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II. Theo van Gogh was a great-grandson of Theo van Gogh, an art dealer who was the brother of painter Vincent van Gogh.

== Career ==
After dropping out of law school at the University of Amsterdam, Van Gogh became a stage manager. His self-proclaimed passion was filmmaking, and he made his debut as a director with the movie &quot;Luger&quot; (1981).

He was awarded a &quot;Gouden Kalf&quot; for &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1996) and &quot;In het belang van de staat&quot; (&quot;In the Interest of the State&quot;, 1997). For the latter, he also received a &quot;Certificate of Merit&quot; from the San Francisco International Film Festival. As an actor, he appeared in the film, &quot;De noorderlingen&quot; (&quot;The Northerners&quot;, 1992). He made numerous films (see below), many on political themes. From the 1990s, Van Gogh also worked in television.

His last book (2003) was &quot;Allah weet het beter&quot; (&quot;Allah Knows Best&quot;), in which he strongly condemned Islam. He was a well-known critic of Islam, particularly after the Iranian Revolution and the September 11 attacks. He supported the nomination of writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali for the Dutch parliament, who was elected. Born in Somalia, she had immigrated to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage. She became a writer and liberal (former PvdA Labour Party) politician.

In the 1980s, Van Gogh became a newspaper columnist. Through the years he used his columns to express his frustration with politicians, actors, film directors, writers and other people he considered to be part of &quot;the establishment&quot;. He delighted in provocation and became a controversial figure, frequently criticising Islamic cultures. He used his website, &quot;De Gezonde Roker&quot; (&quot;The Healthy Smoker&quot;), to express harsh criticism of multicultural society. He said the Netherlands was so rife with social turmoil that it was in danger of turning into &quot;something Belfast-like&quot;.

=== &quot;Submission&quot; ===
Working from a script written by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Van Gogh created the 10-minute short film &quot;Submission&quot;. The movie deals with violence against women in Islamic societies; it tells the stories of four abused Muslim women. The title, &quot;Submission&quot;, is a translation of the word &quot;Islam&quot; into English. In the film, women&#x27;s naked bodies, with texts from the Qur&#x27;an written on them in henna, in an allusion to traditional wedding rituals in some cultures, are veiled with semi-transparent shrouds as the women kneel in prayer, telling their stories as if they are speaking to Allah.

In August 2004, after the movie&#x27;s broadcast on Dutch public TV, the newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; reported that the journalist Francisco van Jole had accused Hirsi Ali and Van Gogh of plagiarism, saying that they had appropriated the ideas of Iranian-American video artist Shirin Neshat, whose work used Arabic text projected onto bodies.

Following the broadcast, both Van Gogh and Hirsi Ali received death threats. Van Gogh did not take the threats seriously and refused any protection. According to Hirsi Ali, he said, &quot;Nobody kills the village idiot&quot;, a term he frequently used about himself.

== Personal life ==
Van Gogh was a member of the Dutch Republican Society movement, which advocates the abolition of the monarchy of the Netherlands. He was a friend and supporter of the controversial Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, who was assassinated in 2002.

== Murder ==


At approximately 9 a.m. on the morning of 2 November 2004, Van Gogh was shot several times and had his throat slit while cycling to work. The perpetrator, 26-year-old Dutch-Moroccan citizen Mohammed Bouyeri, also injured some bystanders and left a note pinned to Van Gogh&#x27;s stomach with a knife containing death threats to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who went into hiding. The note also threatened Western countries and Jews, and referred to ideologies of the Egyptian organisation &quot;Jama&#x27;at al-Muslimin&quot;.

Bouyeri was apprehended by police after a chase. Authorities alleged that he had terrorist ties with the Dutch Islamist Hofstad Network. He was charged with the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders, illegal possession of a firearm, and conspiring to murder others, including Hirsi Ali. He was convicted at trial on 26 July 2005, and sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole.

The murder sparked outrage and grief throughout the Netherlands. Flowers, notes, drawings and other expressions of mourning were left at the scene of the murder.

=== Funeral ===
The cremation ceremony took place on 9 November. Fearing he might not survive a planned flight to New York, Van Gogh had spoken about his funeral wishes with friends shortly before his death. Maarten van Rossem was asked by Van Gogh&#x27;s relatives to speak, something he found difficult in that he wanted to avoid sounding apocalyptic. Van Gogh&#x27;s father suggested that his son would have liked the media attention provoked by his murder.

=== Aftermath ===
The day after the murder, Dutch police arrested eight people allegedly belonging to a group later referred to as the Hofstad Network. Six detainees were Dutch-Moroccans, one was Dutch-Algerian, and one had dual Spanish-Moroccan nationality. The Dutch Complaints Bureau for Discrimination on the Internet (MDI) received many complaints about websites allegedly praising the murder and making death threats against other people.

At the same time, starting with four attempted arson attacks on mosques in the weekend of 5–7 November, there were retaliatory violent incidents against Muslims, including a bomb that exploded at a Muslim school in Eindhoven. The Dutch Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia recorded a total of 106 violent incidents in November against Muslim targets. The National Dutch Police Services Agency (KLPD) recorded 31 occasions of violence against mosques and Islamic schools between 23 November, and 13 March 2005. An arson attack destroyed a Muslim primary school in Uden in December 2004. By 8 November, Christian churches were reported as targets of vandalism and arson attacks in turn. A report for the Anne Frank Foundation and the University of Leiden, accounted for a total of 174 violent incidents between 2–30 November; it said that mosques were the target of violence 47 times, and churches 13 times.

The murder widened and polarised the debate in the Netherlands about the social position of its more than one million Muslim residents. It also put the country&#x27;s liberal tradition further into question, coming only two years after Pim Fortuyn&#x27;s murder. In an apparent reaction against controversial statements about the Islamic, Christian, and Jewish religions—such as those Van Gogh had made—the Dutch Minister of Justice, Christian Democrat Piet Hein Donner, suggested Dutch blasphemy laws should either be applied more stringently or made more strict. The liberal D66 party suggested scrapping the blasphemy laws altogether.

Geert Wilders, at the time an independent member of the House of Representatives, advocated a five-year halt to immigration from non-Western societies, saying: &quot;The Netherlands has been too tolerant to intolerant people for too long. We should not import a retarded political Islamic society into our country&quot;.

Wilders and Ayaan Hirsi Ali went into hiding for several weeks. Wilders has been under the protection of bodyguards ever since, and Hirsi Ali eventually relocated to the United States.

Theo&#x27;s son Lieuwe van Gogh claims he has been attacked on several occasions by young people of Moroccan and Turkish descent, and that the police did not provide him with help or protection. The police denied receiving any report of attacks.

== Legacy and honours ==
On 18 March 2007, a sculpture honouring Theo van Gogh, entitled &quot;De Schreeuw&quot; (&quot;The Scream&quot;), was unveiled in Amsterdam. It is located in the Oosterpark, a short distance from where Van Gogh was murdered. A private trust, the Foundation for Freedom of Expression, was established to help fund protection for critics of Islam and Muslims.

=== Reactions ===
In the English-speaking world, controversy arose after Rohan Jayasekera&#x27;s article on Van Gogh was published in &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;. The Associate Editor of the magazine said that Van Gogh was a &quot;free-speech fundamentalist&quot; who had been on a &quot;martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities&quot; in an &quot;abuse of his right to free speech&quot;. Describing Van Gogh&#x27;s film &quot;Submission&quot; as &quot;furiously provocative&quot;, Jayasekera said his death was:

Both left- and right-wing commentators criticised the article. In December 2004, Nick Cohen of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote:

Cohen&#x27;s account of the conversation was repudiated by the editor of the &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, who responded with a letter to &quot;The Observer&quot;.

<text>Cross Fell is the highest mountain in the Pennines of Northern England and the highest point in England outside the Lake District. It is located in the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It lies within the county of Cumbria and the historic county boundaries of Cumberland.

The summit, at , is a stony plateau, part of a ridge running north-west to south-east, which also incorporates Little Dun Fell at and Great Dun Fell at . The three adjoining fells form an escarpment that rises steeply above the Eden Valley on its south-western side and drops off more gently on its north-eastern side towards the South Tyne and Tees Valleys.

Cross Fell summit is crowned by a cross-shaped dry-stone shelter. On a clear day there are excellent views from the summit across the Eden Valley to the mountains of the Lake District. On the northern side of Cross Fell there are also fine views across the Solway Firth to the Southern Uplands of Scotland.

The fell is prone to dense hill fog and fierce winds. A shrieking noise induced by the Helm Wind is a characteristic of the locality. It can be an inhospitable place for much of the year. In ancient times it was known as &quot;Fiends Fell&quot; and believed to be the haunt of evil spirits. St Augustine of Canterbury is said to have blessed the hill when he arrived here on his travels so it became known as Cross Fell in the Christian tradition, although it has been speculated that the fell became known as Cross Fell (&quot;cross&quot; meaning &quot;angry&quot;) because of the evil spirits.

The fell is home to a mountain bothy (Greg’s hut) which is located approximately to the north of the summit. This bothy is looked after by the Mountain Bothies Association. Greg’s hut is the highest mountain bothy in England sitting on the contour line. From 2010-2023 the Mountain Bothies Association refurbished the bothy, including fitting new windows, flooring, and a new stove.

==Local geography==
The upper parts of Cross Fell and the adjoining fells are formed mainly from beds of mudstone, sandstone and siltstone of the Yoredale Group whilst lower ground is formed by multiple layers of the Carboniferous Limestone. Where erosion-resistant beds surface, there are steep rock faces. There are also strata of shale and gritstone that surface on the fell. On the south and west facing slopes of Cross Fell the rock faces have been broken up by frost action to give a scree slope made up of large boulders. The local terrain shows obvious evidence of recent glaciation and is covered by thin soil and acidic peat.

Cross Fell, Great Dun Fell and Little Dun Fell form a block of high terrain which is all over in elevation. This is the largest block of high ground in England and tends to retain snow-cover longer than neighbouring areas. Snow can be found in gullies on the north side of Cross Fell as late as May in most years. In some years, lying snow has been known to persist until July and fresh snowfall in June (mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere) is common.

Precipitation on Cross Fell averages around per year. Local flora includes a number of rare alpine plants such as the Starry Saxifrage and a mountain Forget-me-not. Cross Fell is covered by what is known as &quot;siliceous alpine and boreal grassland&quot;. It is the southernmost outlier of this vegetation type, which is common to highlands in Scotland and Scandinavia. It is a designated Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Local farmers are required to keep free-roaming sheep off the tops of the fells in order to avoid damaging the natural flora.

Cross Fell is a conspicuous feature in the landscape. It dominates the skyline on almost the entire length of the A66 trunk road between Penrith and Stainmore. It can also be seen from many points in the Lake District, including the Helvellyn summit, and from high ground throughout Dumfriesshire and Northumberland. Most remarkably, it is claimed that it is visible in exceptional circumstances from the summit of Carnedd Llewelyn in Snowdonia (Wales) at a distance of .

<text>In inorganic chemistry, Fajans&#x27; rules, formulated by Kazimierz Fajans in 1923, are used to predict whether a chemical bond will be covalent or ionic, and depend on the charge on the cation and the relative sizes of the cation and anion. They can be summarized in the following table: 

Although the bond in a compound like X+Y- may be considered to be 100% ionic, it will always have some degree of covalent character. When two oppositely charged ions (X+ and Y-) approach each other, the cation attracts electrons in the outermost shell of the anion but repels the positively charged nucleus. This results in a distortion, deformation or polarization of the anion. If the degree of polarization is quite small, an ionic bond is formed, while if the degree of polarization is large, a covalent bond results.

Thus sodium chloride (with a low positive charge (+1), a fairly large cation (~1 Å) and relatively small anion (0.2 Å) is ionic; but aluminium iodide (AlI3) (with a high positive charge (+3) and a large anion) is covalent.

Polarization will be increased by:
* High charge and small size of the cation, due to ionic potential Å Z+/r+ (= polarizing power)
*High charge and large size of the anion, due to polarizability which is related to the deformability of its electron cloud (i.e. its &quot;softness&quot;)
*An incomplete valence shell electron configuration, due to the noble gas configuration of the cation producing better shielding and less polarizing power, for example Hg2+ (r+ = 102 pm) is more polarizing than Ca2+ (r+ = 100 pm)

The &quot;size&quot; of the charge in an ionic bond depends on the number of electrons transferred. An aluminum atom, for example, with a +3 charge has a relatively large positive charge. That positive charge then exerts an attractive force on the electron cloud of the other ion, which has accepted the electrons from the aluminum (or other) positive ion.

Two contrasting examples can illustrate the variation in effects. In the case of aluminum iodide an ionic bond with much covalent character is present. In the AlI3 bonding, the aluminum gains a +3 charge. The large charge pulls on the electron cloud of the iodine. Now, if we consider the iodine atom, we see that it is relatively large and thus the outer shell electrons are relatively well shielded from the nuclear charge. In this case, the aluminum ion&#x27;s charge will &quot;tug&quot; on the electron cloud of iodine, drawing it closer to itself. As the electron cloud of the iodine nears the aluminum atom, the negative charge of the electron cloud &quot;cancels&quot; out the positive charge of the aluminum cation. This produces an ionic bond with covalent character. A cation having inert gas like configuration has less polarizing power in comparison to cation having pseudo-inert gas like configuration.

The situation is different in the case of aluminum fluoride, AlF3. In this case, iodine is replaced by fluorine, a relatively small highly electronegative atom. The fluorine&#x27;s electron cloud is less shielded from the nuclear charge and will thus be less polarizable. Thus, we get an ionic compound (metal bonded to a nonmetal) with a slight covalent character.

<text>The Brixton riots of 1995 began on 13 December after the death of a black 26-year-old, Wayne Douglas, in police custody. Douglas had allegedly robbed a couple in bed at knifepoint hours earlier. Trouble broke out after what had been a peaceful protest outside the Brixton Police Station where the death occurred. With several hundred people involved, the riot resulted in damage to property and vehicles in the area. Police sealed off a three-kilometre (2 mile) area around Brixton in south London.

The riot lasted for five hours. 22 people were arrested and charged with public order offences, theft and criminal damage. Three police officers were hurt.

The then-Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, condemned the riots and said &quot;efforts to improve Brixton would continue&quot;.

== Death of Wayne Douglas ==
Wayne Douglas was in police custody to be questioned about a burglary. Police reported that he collapsed in Brixton Police Station. The police statement said that Douglas died after collapsing while being questioned. Although the post-mortem on Douglas revealed that he had died of heart failure, the inquest into his death showed that he had been held face-down with his hands cuffed behind his back on four occasions. The post-mortem also revealed that Douglas had suffered from heart disease.

== The riots ==
The picketing of Brixton Police Station over the death of Douglas reportedly developed into a march down Brixton Road (Brixton High Street). Violence was triggered by a standoff between the police and about 100 demonstrators. Witnesses have reported hearing groups of black youths shouting &quot;Killers, killers&quot; at the police. Some eyewitness accounts describe the police presence at the demonstration as &quot;incredibly heavy-handed&quot;.

The BBC reported that &quot;hundreds&quot; of black and white youths participated in the riot. Rioters attacked police, ransacked shops and burned cars. According to the police &quot;Officers were wearing protective clothing because we had reports of missiles being thrown.&quot; In an attempt to contain the riot around 50 police officers in riot gear formed lines to close Brixton&#x27;s main road (Brixton Road), preventing anyone from entering the area. The street had been the scene of rioting in 1981. Police also sealed off a two-mile area around the centre of Brixton and closed Brixton and Stockwell stations. A police helicopter was dispatched over Brixton. It was reported that shots were fired as the centre of the demonstration moved into the area of the Ritzy Cinema. It was also reported that a crowd of at least ten rioters pulled a police motorcyclist from his machine. The Dogstar, Coldharbour Lane was among the businesses attacked by the rioters. Formerly The Atlantic, a predominantly black pub, and recently refurbished. The riot later developed into what police called &quot;sporadic pockets of trouble in the area around Brixton town centre&quot;. The police stated that &quot;We gave them every opportunity to move off peacefully but they hadn&#x27;t done so.&quot;

One police officer suffered a broken shoulder, fractured ribs and bruising during the riots. He praised the Territorial Support Group for protecting him from rioters after he was knocked off his motorbike and beaten.

== Causes ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that local residents were outraged by the death of a black man in police custody and saw the riots as expression of alienation in an impoverished area devastated by race riots in 1981. It quotes Harold Douglas, 39, as saying: 

Last night happened because the only time a black man is seen and listened to is when he comes out on the street...They cause a million pounds of damage and then people start taking notice.
At a news conference at the time, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon is quoted to have said:

It was not Brixton rioting last night. It was a small minority of thugs and criminals who, as ever, were looking for the opportunity to embark on criminal activities.
A local resident at the time stated:

Local people are not only pissed off with the death of Wayne Douglas but the whole gentrification of Brixton. Council houses and houses occupied by squatters are being sold off and local pubs like the Atlantic, traditionally run by black people, was opened last week by yuppies as &#x27;The Dog Star&#x27;. In anger this was smashed, looted and burnt out. The £33 million City Challenge development including CCTV is only of benefit to big business not local stallholders.
SchNews quoted another local resident, identified as &#x27;Joyce&#x27;, as saying:

People were putting up barricades. There were hundreds of people involved, mostly young black and white people and they were local, they weren&#x27;t outsiders. This was a combination of black people dying in police custody and the way Brixton is at the moment. The place is being yuppified with City Challenge while unemployed centres, adventure playgrounds and libraries are getting shut.

<text>Count Józef Kajetan Ossoliński (1758–15 April 1834) was a notable Polish szlachcic (nobleman) with a distinguished political career. He served as the Castellan of the Podlaskie Voivodeship from 1790 and was a Senator Castellan of the Kingdom of Poland from 1822 to 1824. Additionally, he held the position of Starost of Sandomierz starting in 1781. Ossoliński was active in politics throughout his life, participating as a representative from the Drohiczyn region in various parliamentary sessions, including the Four-Year Sejm and the Targowica Confederation.

Ossoliński was born into a prominent family; his father, Aleksander Maciej Ossoliński, was a notable court official. Over his lifetime, he was married twice and had three children, including a daughter and a son who continued the family legacy.

He also gained recognition as a collector of art, creating a gallery in his palace in Warsaw, which housed works acquired from King Stanisław August Poniatowski.

<doc id="1126823" wikidata="Q1687222" url="?curid=1126823" title="Flame tank">
<text>A flame tank is a type of tank equipped with a flamethrower, most commonly used to supplement combined arms attacks against fortifications, confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the Second World War, during which the United States, Nazi Germany, Soviet Union, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks.

A number of production methods were used. The flamethrowers used were either modified versions of existing infantry flame weapons (Flammpanzer I and II) or specially designed (Flammpanzer III). They were mounted externally (Flammpanzer II), replaced existing machine gun mounts, or replaced the tank&#x27;s main armament (Flammpanzer III). Fuel for the flame weapon was either carried inside the tank, in armoured external storage, or in some cases in a special trailer behind the tank (Churchill Crocodile).

==Combat effectiveness==

In comparison to man-portable flamethrowers, flame tanks carried much more fuel, and could fire longer-ranged bursts. Due to their ability to get in range of enemy positions in comparative safety, they were invaluable for rooting out heavy infantry fortifications. For example, as the main guns of US tanks were largely unsuccessful in penetrating the thick bunkers created by the Japanese defenders on islands such as Tarawa or Iwo Jima, flame throwing tanks were used instead while infantrymen provided the necessary security during their deployment. On Iwo Jima the marines learned that conventional firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders and effectively used flamethrowers and grenades to flush out Japanese troops in the tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight Sherman M4A3R3 medium tanks equipped with flamethrowers (&quot;Ronson&quot; or &quot;Zippo&quot; tanks), proved very effective at clearing Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, such that defenders were often compelled to assault them in the open, where they would face the full firepower of marine rifle and machine gun fire.

The maximum range of a flamethrower was typically less than 150 metres. Because of this limitation, the flamethrower was virtually useless on an open battlefield. However, they proved a potent psychological weapon against fortified troops. In many instances, troops surrendered or fled upon seeing a flame tank fire ranging shots, rather than risk being burned alive.

Experience of combat use of flamethrower tanks was mixed. German flamethrower variants of the Panzer II and Panzer III were both discontinued due to unsatisfactory performance and converted into assault guns or tank destroyers. The Panzer IV was never converted into a flame variant, despite having been configured for many other roles.

The mixed results were in part due to the development of infantry anti-tank weapons. At the start of the Second World War most infantry units had weapons with some effectiveness against armoured targets at ranges of thirty to fifty meters, like anti-tank rifles. Towards the end of the war, more powerful anti-tank weapons such as the bazooka, Panzerschreck, and PIAT were introduced which were fatal to tanks at ranges longer than the tank&#x27;s flamethrower could reach.

British Churchill Crocodiles supported the U.S. Army in the summer of 1944 during the fight over the Normandy hedgerows or the &quot;Bocage country&quot; and used a squadron during the fighting at the Battle for Brest, notably aiding in the defeat of a Fallschirmjäger garrison at the siege of Montbarey fortress on 16 September 1944. The US Army received a smaller American designed flamethrower mounted upon the M4 Sherman tank during the same month of September 1944, assigned to the US Army&#x27;s 70th Tank Battalion, the flamethrowing tanks went into action on 18 September 1944, where it was found that the weapons had a very short range as compared to the British &quot;Crocodiles&quot;, and consequently were not very popular amongst US troops.

The Canadian and Dutch armies became two of the most active users of the Wasp variant of the universal carrier equipped with a flamethrower. While fighting in Europe, the Wasp was found to be extremely effective in prying German soldiers from their defenses. Indeed, the mechanical flamethrowers, although not impressive by themselves, struck horror into the minds of German troops, who feared them more than any other conventional weapon. Canadian troops used them during the Battle of the Scheldt.
In contrast to man-portable flamethrowers that were vulnerable to bullets and shrapnel, making them extremely dangerous to their operators, flame tanks were extremely difficult to catch on fire or explode unless hit with an armor piercing round or explosive reaching the ammunition and engine fuel inside the tank&#x27;s main hull. Tanks such as the Churchill Crocodile, which towed the flamethrower liquid container behind the actual tank, held no greater risk of fire than standard tanks. Although the towed container itself could be easily targeted, the tank and its crew remained well protected. The armored trailer and armored coupling of the Churchill Crocodile could be jettisoned from inside the tank if necessary.

Crews of flame tanks were not necessarily more vulnerable than those in the standard version of the tank (a Churchill Crocodile flame tank being more or less as vulnerable to anti-tank weapons as the standard Churchill), but the crews of flamethrowing tanks were allegedly treated differently should they be captured alive. Due to the perceived inhumanity of the weapon itself, captured crews of such tanks were allegedly treated much less humanely than crews of regular tanks. The allies suspected that there were instances where flametankers were executed by German troops upon capture, and although some published sources claim this was a fact, but not a single specific instance is known to have been documented. Nevertheless, British tank crews received sixpence a day extra &quot;danger money&quot; due to the threat of arbitrary execution. Flame tanks also suffered from the fact, along with flamethrower-armed troops, that all enemy within range would usually fire on them due to the fear of the weapon.

== World War I ==
Some vehicles equipped with flamethrowers were trialed by various nations during World War I, although none were used in combat. Some examples include the Steam Tank and General Jackson&#x27;s Pedrail prototype.

== Interwar period ==
The successes of the Soviet defense industry, in the late 1920s, made it possible to begin the motorization and mechanization of the Soviet Armed Forces.

In 1932, the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR adopted a resolution &quot;On giving the mechanized brigade chemical and other means to fight the enemy&#x27;s entrenched infantry&quot;, thereby setting the direction for the design of chemical tanks (flamethrowers were issued to chemical troops). The T-26 tank was chosen as the basis for the chemical tank, which was put into mass production in the USSR in 1931. This armored vehicle, for that period of time, was distinguished by good performance, surpassing foreign tanks in terms of armor and driving performance. The task for the development of a chemical combat vehicle (BKhM-3 / KhT-26) was assigned to the Military Chemical Directorate (VOKHIMU) of the Red Army, in turn, VOKHIM, entrusted this work to KB-2 of plant No. 174 in Leningrad and the design bureau of the Kompressor plant (chemical equipment). BKhM-3, in addition to the flamethrower, was equipped with smoke launchers and toxic sprays, so these tanks were called not flamethrower, but &quot;chemical&quot;.

The first combat-ready flamethrower tanks appeared in the early 1930s: KhT-27, KhT-26 and a number of others - in the USSR, CV3 LF - in Italy. Before the start of World War II b more than 1,300 flamethrower tanks of various types were produced by Soviet industry.

By the mid-1930s, the first combat use of flamethrower tanks took place. Italy used its flamethrower tanks in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War of 1935-1936, and the CV3 LF was also used by the Italian Expeditionary Force during the Spanish Civil War.
Soviet troops first used flamethrower tanks against the Japanese at Khasan in 1938 and later a Khalkhin Gol in 1939.

In 1931 the São Paulo Public Force created an assault car section. The first vehicle to be incorporated was a flame tank built from a Caterpillar Twenty Two Tractor. The vehicle was developed by lieutenant Reynaldo Ramos de Saldanha da Gama, with help from the Polytechnic school. It was built from riveted steel plates, with a rotating flamethrower turret, and four 7mm Hotchkiss machineguns mounted on the hull. The Flamethrowers&#x27; effective range was a hundred meters. The tank was used in combat during the Constitutionalist Revolution, routing federal troops from a bridge in an engagement at Cruzeiro.

During the battle of Kilometer 7 to Saavedra in the Chaco War, Major Walther Kohn rode in a flamethrower equipped tankette; due to heat he exited the tank to fight on foot and was killed in combat.

== Post–Cold War and 21st century ==

Since 1978, flamethrowers and the last flame &#x27;tank&#x27; the M132 armored flamethrower have not been part of the US arsenal. Though not banned, these weapons have fallen out of use and have instead been replaced with non-flamethrower incendiary weapons like thermobaric weapons which may have been fielded in Afghanistan by the United States in 2009 and by Russia in the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian war.

<text>Kenneth Robert Howard (September 7, 1929 – September 19, 1992), also known as Dutch, Von Dutch, or J. L. Bachs (Joe Lunch Box), was an American motorcycle mechanic, artist, pin striper, metal fabricator, knifemaker and gunsmith.

==Early life==
As the son of a sign painter, Howard learned to letter and pinstripe professionally by the age of 10. While attending Compton High School, Howard excelled in track and field and was referred to as &quot;the fastest man in LA.&quot; Family members gave him the nickname &quot;Dutch&quot; because he was &quot;as stubborn as a Dutchman,&quot; he added the &quot;Von&quot; prefix later as an artistic signature.

==Work==
Howard started earning money in the 1950s by pin-striping along with fellow striper Dean Jeffries. Von Dutch has been a major influence in the customizing of vehicles from the 1950s to today. Some of his famous works include the flying eyeball logo and the custom Kenford truck, along with numerous custom motorcycles and many award-winning custom cars. Among many custom car and motorcycle enthusiasts, he is thought of as one of the fathers of Kustom Kulture. In fact, Von Dutch created the K in KUSTOM, a nod to his affection for German esthetics.

His most lasting work is the creation of the special &#x27;pearlescent&#x27; color used to paint movie star Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s car, known as Candy-Apple Red. Many automobile, motorcycle, bicycle and ATV manufacturers still offer a Candy-Apple Red on their vehicles today.

An avid gunsmith and knife maker, Von Dutch made numerous art knives and embellished firearms. Most of these were adaptations of existing items to which he added his artistic flair. In 1958, Von Dutch designed and produced the &quot;Mare&#x27;s Leg&quot;, a cut-down Winchester rifle for the television series &quot;&quot;.

Von Dutch completed pin striping the well-known &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; Pontiac Firebird in 1979, which is complete with two perfectly parallel pin stripes feet long down each side of the vehicle. These pin stripes were completed by hand and attained a level of perfection that gave rise to the legend of Von Dutch as a pin striper.

==Death==
Von Dutch&#x27;s lifelong alcoholism led to major medical issues later in life. He died on September 19, 1992, from alcohol-related complications, leaving behind his two daughters, Lisa and Lorna. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

== Von Dutch Originals, LLC ==

After his death, his daughters created a clothing line because Dutch left all his prized possessions to the Bruckers. His daughters only sold the clothing rights &quot;Von Dutch&quot; name to Michael Cassel and Robert Vaughn. In 2009 Tonny Sorensen, then CEO of Von Dutch, sold the company to Groupe Royer, a French footwear company.

== Racism and anti-sociality ==
In January 2004, an &quot;OC Weekly&quot; article alleged Howard&#x27;s violent and racist tendencies. Robert Williams, a friend and fellow artist, said Howard was &quot;...quite a racist; didn&#x27;t like anybody. Howard was accused of having all the trappings of being a neo-Nazi. Another accusation suggested he could not tolerate black people.&quot; The article alleges that a letter written shortly before Howard&#x27;s death in 1992, when he was in the hospital, closed with “Bye, Heil Hitler.” After the publication of the article, a number of retailers removed Von Dutch from their inventory despite its profitability.

In May 2004, &quot;Los Angeles Magazine&quot; profiled Howard similarly, describing his alcoholism and anti-social behaviour. Von Dutch clothing founder Ed Boswell described Howard as &quot;...as an avid military enthusiast enamored of German Military esthetics. But he was not a white power guy. He hated everybody too much to be one of those. He was a provocateur.&quot;
In the 2021 documentary “The curse of Von Dutch: A brand to die for” (a three episode mini-series that aired on streaming service Hulu) Ed Boswell admits that he was responsible and now ashamed of “letting the cat out of the bag” about Howard&#x27;s alleged nazi beliefs, in order to bring down the clothing brand that allegedly owed him money (“1%”).

<text>Von Dutch is an American multinational fashion brand posthumously named after Kenny Howard, a.k.a. &quot;Von Dutch&quot;, an American artist and pinstriper of the Kustom Kulture movement. After Howard&#x27;s death in 1992, his daughters allowed Ed Boswell to produce items using the Von Dutch trademark logo. The trademark rights were sold in 1996 to Mike Cassell who, with Robert Vaughn, used the logo for an apparel line named Von Dutch Originals. French designer Christian Audigier helped popularize the brand in the early 2000s. Von Dutch was repurchased in 2009 by Groupe Royer S.A., through its Luxembourg subsidiary Royer brands International S.a.r.l. In 2024, WSG (White Space Group) purchased the global rights from Groupe Royer S.A. and plans to continue the journey of bringing Von Dutch back in a compelling way.

The clothing brand gained popularity in the US and attracted the attention of celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Whitney Houston, Madonna, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Ashton Kutcher and Eric Church.

== History ==
===Kenny Howard===
Kenneth Robert Howard was an American motorcycle mechanic, artist, pin striper, metal fabricator, knifemaker and gunsmith. The inspiration to create the clothing line started with Howard&#x27;s daughters Lisa and Lorna after his death. They decided to use his artistic name Von Dutch; &quot;Dutch&quot; was a family nickname for Howard because he was considered to be &quot;as stubborn as a Dutchman&quot;. 

Howard had passion for cars and motorcycles. He also created special effects for Hollywood films, and served as a consultant for several period films. His most recognizable work was in 1955 at the 1955 Motorama; he was able to stripe a 1927 Studebaker for 10 days. Today, Howard is known as the father of modern pin-striping.

He was famously indifferent about the rights to his work, dismissing copyrights and patents as an &quot;ego trip&quot;. He sold the Von Dutch name to fellow pinstriper Steve Kafka for $5,000.

Howard was a virulent racist and admirer of Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich. “A letter he wrote about abandoning harsh medical treatment for a fatal illness is blunt: ‘I am not willing to go through it anymore only to emerge in a place full of Africans, Mexicans and Jews. … I have always been a Nazi and still believe it was the last time the world had a chance of being operated with logic. What a shame so many Americans died and suffered to make the rich richer and save England &amp; France again, or was that still. I hope you lying wimps get swallowed up with your stupidity,’” he wrote. 

Howard died in 1992 of liver failure, resulting from alcoholism.

===Beginning of the company===
In the 1990s, art collector Ed Boswell began selling Von Dutch patches at Los Angeles art shows, having procured the rights to the Von Dutch name from Howard&#x27;s daughters. He met former drug dealer Michael Cassel and competitive surfer Bobby Vaughn at a trade show, and they decided to go into business together, initially deciding to create an apparel line of garage-themed jeans and workwear. Cassel and Vaughn eventually bought Boswell out of the company, and brought in entrepreneur Tonny Sørensen as CEO and investor. Sørensen hired Christian Audigier in 2002 to design for the brand. Audigier came up with the trucker hat, inspired by classic Americana such as Marlon Brando&#x27;s motorcycle cap in &quot;The Wild One&quot;.

===Success===

The early 2000s were the prime years for the company. Celebrities were spotted wearing a variety of Von Dutch apparel such as jackets, t-shirts, and, most notably, trucker hats. Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake played a vital role in the rise of Von Dutch. Audigier met with Spears in Los Angeles in 2002 and convinced her to wear the brand. Soon afterward, Spears and Timberlake made national news with their breakup, and happened to be wearing Von Dutch trucker hats on the cover of &quot;People&quot;. The exposure helped grow the brand, and it began selling.

Other celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Ashton Kutcher, and Beyoncé were seen wearing the $100 trucker hat. Kutcher was constantly seen wearing Von Dutch in the early 2000s, especially on episodes of &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;. Von Dutch&#x27;s popularity peaked in 2003, with sales of over $33 million.

===Behind-the scenes tumult===
Sørensen fired Vaughn and became sole owner in 2002. He also began sidelining Cassel as a designer in favor of Audigier. Vaughn and Cassel became openly hostile to Sørensen; at one point, Cassel hired drug lord Pablo Escobar&#x27;s grandson to intimidate him into selling his stake in the company for $500,000, a proposal that Sørensen refused. Vaughn, meanwhile, tried to intimidate Cassel into selling his shares of the company, and accused him of calling the police when he refused.

In February 2005, Vaughn was arrested on charges of first degree murder after he shot and killed childhood friend Mark Rivas, who he claimed attacked him with a broken bottle. He was acquitted in 2006.

===Decline===
By the late 2000s, Von Dutch began to experience a rapid decline due to issues such as brand saturation and counterfeiting. In May 2004, Boswell, who resented Cassel and Vaughn for buying him out of the company just before it became successful, leaked to the press a letter written by Howard in 1992, in which the late artist made several racist and antisemitic remarks and professed admiration for Nazi Germany. Despite Howard having nothing to do with the clothing line, this letter destroyed what little popularity the company had left; by 2004, the fashion press had derisively nicknamed the brand &quot;Von Douche&quot;. Audigier left the company in 2007. In 2009, Sorenson sold the brand to French footwear company Groupe Royer.

===Resurgence===
In 2016 Von Dutch started to make a comeback when Kylie Jenner was seen wearing the famous trucker hat, jackets and two-piece sets. In 2019 Von Dutch hired Ed Goldman as its general manager, and he started to create connections with Los Angeles&#x27; hip-hop community; rappers such as Travis Scott, Saweetie, and Megan Thee Stallion were soon seen wearing the brand on Instagram, and the company partnered with Young Thug in 2021 to create a line of streetwear. Von Dutch also became popular with Internet celebrities such as Emma Chamberlain and Addison Rae.

As of 2021, Earl Pickens is the executive director of design. In 2024 Charli XCX released a song named Von Dutch as the lead single from her sixth studio album, &quot;Brat&quot;.

<text>Nettlestead is a village and civil parish on the road south-west of, and part of the borough of Maidstone. The parish includes Nettlestead Green and part of Seven Mile Lane. More than 800 people live in the parish. The parish church of St Mary the Virgin has links with William the Conqueror&#x27;s half brother, Odo.

Reginald de Pympe, Member of Parliament for Kent in 1411 and 1422, moved into Nettlestead Place, which he rebuilt. He, and his son John, also added new stained glass windows to the parish church.

Nettlestead Green is a separate village lying two miles farther south. Both villages are close to the River Medway. Wateringbury is immediately to the north.

<text>Hendrik Willem Mesdag (; 23 February 183110 July 1915) was a Dutch marine painter.

==Biography==

He was born in Groningen, the son of the banker Klaas Mesdag and his wife Johanna Wilhelmina van Giffen. Mesdag was encouraged by his father, an amateur painter, to study art. He married Sina van Houten in 1856, and when they inherited a fortune from her father, Mesdag retired from banking at the age of 35 to pursue a career as a painter.

He studied in Brussels with Willem Roelofs and in 1868 moved to The Hague to paint the sea. In 1870 he exhibited at the Paris Salon and won the gold medal for &quot;The Breakers of the North Sea&quot;.

In 1880 he received a commission from a Belgian company to paint a panorama giving a view over the village of Scheveningen on the North Sea coast near The Hague. With the help of Sina and students he completed the enormous painting, &quot;Panorama Mesdag,&quot;— 14 m high and 120 m around — by 1881. However, the vogue for panoramas was coming to an end, and when the company operating it went bust in 1886, Mesdag purchased the painting at auction and thereafter funding its operating losses from his own pocket.

He joined the art society of The Hague (the &quot;Pulchri Studio&quot;) and in 1889 was elected chairman. In 1903 he gave his house at Laan van Meerdervoort and his collection of paintings to the Netherlands; the house is now The Mesdag Collection.

<doc id="1126849" wikidata="Q1643259" url="?curid=1126849" title="Summum bonum">
<text>Summum bonum is a Latin expression meaning the highest or ultimate good, which was introduced by the Roman philosopher Cicero to denote the fundamental principle on which some system of ethics is based — that is, the aim of actions, which, if consistently pursued, will lead to the best possible life. Since Cicero, the expression has acquired a secondary meaning as the essence or ultimate metaphysical principle of Goodness itself, or what Plato called the Form of the Good. These two meanings do not necessarily coincide. For example, Epicurean and Cyrenaic philosophers claimed that the &#x27;good life&#x27; consistently aimed for pleasure, without suggesting that pleasure constituted the meaning or essence of Goodness outside the ethical sphere. In &quot;De finibus&quot;, Cicero explains and compares the ethical systems of several schools of Greek philosophy, including Stoicism, Epicureanism, Aristotelianism and Platonism, based on how each defines the ethical &quot;summum bonum&quot; differently. 

The term was used in medieval philosophy. In the Thomist synthesis of Aristotelianism and Christianity, the highest good is usually defined as the life of the righteous and/or the life led in communion with God and according to God&#x27;s precepts. In Kantianism, it was used to describe the ultimate importance, the singular and overriding end which human beings ought to pursue.

==Plato and Aristotle==
Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot; argued that, &quot;In the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen...to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right&quot;. Silent contemplation was the route to appreciation of the Idea of the Good.

Aristotle in his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; accepted that the target of human activity, &quot;Must be the &#x27;Good&#x27;, that is, the supreme good.&quot;, but challenged Plato&#x27;s Idea of the Good with the pragmatic question: &quot;Will one who has had a vision of the Idea itself become thereby a better doctor or general?&quot;. However, arguably at least, Aristotle&#x27;s concept of the unmoved mover owed much to Plato&#x27;s Idea of the Good.

==Hellenic syncretism==
Philo of Alexandria harmonized the Old Testament God with the unmoved mover and the Idea of the Good. Plotinus, the neoplatonic philosopher, built on Plato&#x27;s Good for his concept of the supreme One, while Plutarch drew on Zoroastrianism to develop his eternal principle of good.

Augustine of Hippo in his early writings offered the &quot;summum bonum&quot; as the highest human goal, but was later to identify it as a feature of the Christian God in &quot;De natura boni&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Good&quot;, c. 399). Augustine denies the positive existence of absolute evil, describing a world with God as the supreme good at the center, and defining different grades of evil as different stages of remoteness from that center.

==Later developments==
The &quot;summum bonum&quot; has continued to be a focus of attention in Western philosophy, secular and religious. Hegel replaced Plato&#x27;s dialectical ascent to the Good by his own dialectical ascent to the Real.

G. E. Moore placed the highest good in personal relations and the contemplation of beauty – even if not all his followers in the Bloomsbury Group may have appreciated what Clive Bell called his &quot;all-important distinction between &#x27;Good on the whole&#x27; and &#x27;Good as a whole&#x27;&quot;.

The doctrine of the highest good maintained by Immanuel Kant can be seen as the fulfillment of all rational will. It is the supreme end of the will, meaning that beyond the attainment of a good will, which is moral excellence signified by abiding by the categorical imperative and pure practical reason, this is not reducible to hypothetical imperatives such as happiness. Furthermore, in virtue of the doctrine of the highest good, Kant postulates the existence of God and the eternal existence of rational agents, in order to reconcile three premises: (i) that agents are morally obligated to fully attain the highest good; (ii) that the object of an agent&#x27;s obligation must be possible; (iii) that an agent&#x27;s full realization of the highest good is not possible.

==Judgments==

Judgments on the highest good have generally fallen into four categories:
* Utilitarianism, when the highest good is identified with the maximum possible psychological happiness for the maximum number of people;
* Eudaemonism or virtue ethics, when the highest good is identified with flourishing;
* Rational deontologism, when the highest good is identified with virtue or duty;
* Rational eudaemonism, or tempered deontologism, when both virtue and happiness are combined in the highest good.

<doc id="1126852" wikidata="Q1206754" url="?curid=1126852" title="Lugné-Poe">
<text>Aurélien-Marie Lugné (27 December 1869 19 June 1940), known by his stage and pen name Lugné-Poe, was a French actor, theatre director, and scenic designer. He founded the landmark Paris theatre company, the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre, which produced experimental work by French Symbolist writers and painters at the end of the nineteenth century. Like his contemporary, theatre pioneer André Antoine, he gave the French premieres of works by the leading Scandinavian playwrights Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.

==Early career==
In 1887, at age 17, Lugné-Poe and friend Georges Bourdon created an amateur theatre group called le Cercle des Escholiers, which sought to perform &quot;unpublished or, at the very least, little-known works.&quot; As he prepared to audition for the Paris Conservatory, he changed his name from Lugné to &quot;Lugné-Poe&quot; in homage to Edgar Allan Poe. While the Conservatory rejected his audition in fall 1887, they accepted him in fall 1888; days later he joined André Antoine&#x27;s Théâtre Libre, a subscriber-based Naturalist independent theatre. After appearing in the first play of that season under his own name, Lugné-Poe adopted the stage names &quot;Philippon,&quot; &quot;Delorme,&quot; and &quot;Leroy&quot; for the duration of his association with Antoine&#x27;s company.

Lugné-Poe continued acting lessons at the Conservatory under the great Comédie-Française star Gustave Worms while appearing in Théâtre Libre&#x27;s 1888-1889 season and the first half of the next. But tensions grew over the next year as Antoine bullied and blamed his actors, including Lugné-Poe, for weak performances. After their falling out while on tour in Belgium in early 1890, Lugné-Poe concentrated on his Conservatory competition showcases, winning a First-Place certificate for Comedy in early 1890. His obligation to fulfill military service in the fall, however, suspended his theatrical rise. Before his departure, he had already befriended a group of painters known as The Nabis, and publicized their work in a series of articles.

Returning from an abbreviated military service in early spring 1891, Lugné-Poe joined Paul Fort&#x27;s Théâtre d&#x27;Art, first appearing in Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Intruse&quot;. For the next two years, he moved regularly between acting for the Théâtre d&#x27;Art and directing for his former company Le Cercle des Escholiers. Lugné-Poe performed in ten plays altogether for Fort, interpreting, most notably, the Maeterlinck rôles of the Old Man in &quot;L&#x27;Intruse&quot; (1891) and the First Blind Man in &quot;Les Aveugles&quot; (1891), as well as Satan in Jules Bois&#x27; &quot;Les Noces de Sathan&quot; (1892). He, along with Georgette Camée, forged the signature Symbolist acting style that conveys a reverie, with its hieratic movement and gestures, matched with solemn, psalmodized line readings. After the disappointing plays of the March 28, 1892 program, Fort called a halt to the Théâtre d&#x27;Art. Lugné-Poe put his talents to staging and acting in noteworthy plays with the Cercle des Escholiers, which culminated with Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot; (1892). It was only the fourth French-translated Ibsen play to open in Paris, after Antoine&#x27;s landmark productions of &quot;Ghosts&quot; in 1890 and &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; in 1891, and Albert Carré&#x27;s production of &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; in December 1891. When Lugné-Poe reconstituted the Théâtre d&#x27;Art as the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre in 1893, he would make Ibsen his specialty in Paris theatre, premiering (and often starring in) nine Ibsen plays between 1893 and 1897.

==Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre==
Like Paul Fort before him, Lugné-Poe never secured a permanent stage for the entire run of his company&#x27;s initial art-theatre experiment. The Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre debuted with Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; for a single matinée performance at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens in May 1893, but the six engagements in his next season occurred at the distant Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, where he premiered Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Rosmersholm&quot;, &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, and &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Lives&quot;, and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Human Power&quot;, among others. For the May 1894 production of Henri Bataille and Robert d&#x27;Humières&#x27; &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, he secured Nouveau-Théâtre&#x27;s space for the first time. Though he concluded the season with August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Creditors&quot; at the newly built Comédie-Parisienne (later known as Louis Jouvet&#x27;s Théâtre de l&#x27;Athénée), he quickly assumed the directorship of Nouveau-Théâtre for most of the 1894-95 season. There he premiered Maeterlinck&#x27;s adaptation of John Ford&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (&quot;Annabella&quot;), Beaubourg&#x27;s &quot;The Mute Voice&quot;, Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Father&quot;, Śūdraka&#x27;s &quot;The Little Clay Cart&quot;, and Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Interior&quot;, among others. While his May 1895 productions (including Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Little Eyolf&quot;) were staged at the Théâtre des Menus-Plaisirs, he returned to Nouveau-Théâtre to conclude the season with Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Brand&quot;.

The 1895-96 season found residence at two locations. Lugné-Poe staged the first half of the season back at the Comédie-Parisienne, with a line-up that included Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserved&quot;, Kālidāsa&#x27;s &quot;The Ring of Shakuntalā&quot;, and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;.
The second half, however, starting in March 1896, began over two-years&#x27; residency for the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre at Nouveau-Théâtre. Most notably, they premiered Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Pillars of Society&quot; (22-23 June 1896) and &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (11-12 November 1896); Alfred Jarry&#x27;s &quot;Ubu Roi&quot; (9-10 December 1896); Bjørnson&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Beyond Human Power&quot; (25-26 January 1897); Hauptmann&#x27;s fairy drama &quot;The Sunken Bell&quot; (4-5 March 1897); Bataille&#x27;s &quot;Your Blood&quot; (7-8 May 1897); Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Comedy&quot; (22-23 June 1897) and &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot; (8-9 November 1897); Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Inspector General&quot; (7-8 January 1898); and Romain Rolland&#x27;s &quot;Aert&quot; (2-3 May 1898) and &quot;The Wolves&quot; (18 May 1898). For their last season, the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre gave two undistinguished premieres—Paul Sonniès&#x27; &quot;Fausta&quot; (15-16 May 1899) and Lucien Mayrargue&#x27;s &quot;The Yoke&quot; (5-6 June 1899)—preferring to hold the much anticipated revival of &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; at the grander Théâtre de la Renaissance in February. Lugné-Poe&#x27;s last productions for the company were done at the very theatre where the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre had begun in 1893 with &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;: the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens. By the close of the nineteenth century, Lugné-Poe&#x27;s company had successfully established half a dozen Parisian theatres as sites for daring, challenging, and at times outrageous modern drama.

In 1895, Jakub Grein and the Independent Theatre Society invited Lugné-Poe and his troupe to present a season of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Rosmersholm&quot;, &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, and Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s symbolist &quot;L&#x27;Intruse&quot; and &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; in London.

<text>Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski (1 December 1734 – 19 March 1823) was an influential Polish aristocrat, writer, literary and theater critic, linguist, traveller and statesman. He was a great patron of arts and a candidate for the Polish crown. He was educated in England and after his return to Poland in 1758, he became a member of the Sejm (parliament), Crown General of Podolia and Marshal of General Confederation of Kingdom of Poland.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was the son of Prince August Aleksander Czartoryski, voivode of the Ruthenian Voivodeship, and Maria Zofia Sieniawska. He married Izabela Fleming on 18 November 1761, in Wołczyn, Poland.

===Political career===

A member of the &quot;Familia&quot;, in 1763 he declined to be a candidate for the Polish crown, preferring instead to be a patron of the arts, and withdrawing in favor of Stanisław August Poniatowski. With his wife, Izabela Czartoryska, he created at the Czartoryski Palace in Puławy a major center of Polish intellectual and political life.

He served from 1758 as general starost of Podolia. Founder of the &quot;Little Monitor&quot;, in 1765 he co-founded the &quot;Monitor&quot;, the leading periodical of the Polish Enlightenment. In 1766 he reorganized the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1767 he joined the Radom Confederation. In 1768 he became the commander of the School of Chivalry (Corps of Cadets). In 1788-1792 he was Deputy from Lublin to the &quot;Four-Year Sejm.&quot; Drawing closer to the king once again, he became a leader of the Patriotic Party and co-founder of Poland&#x27;s Commission of National Education. He supported the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, and headed a diplomatic mission to Dresden, attempting to convince Frederick Augustus III, Elector of Saxony to support the Commonwealth and accept its throne (after Poniatowski&#x27;s future death). He refused to join the Targowica Confederation established to bring the Constitution down.

He received the Order of the White Eagle on 25 November 1764.

He was Marshal of the Convocation Sejm of 7 May - 23 June 1764, and of the Extraordinary Sejm of 26–28 June 1812, held in Warsaw. Thus he became Marshal of General Confederation of Kingdom of Poland.
==Remembrance==
He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting, &quot;Constitution of May 3, 1791.&quot;

<text>Nettlestead Green, like its near neighbour Nettlestead, lies in the Medway valley southwest of Maidstone in Kent.

It has a church and a 17th-century pub. The railway station for Yalding is actually closer to Nettlestead Green than to its own village, which lies on the opposite side of the River Medway.

It was here on 26 June 1944 that Warrant Officer R.A.B (&quot;Red&quot;) Blumer RAAF died when his Spitfire crashed. A memorial has been erected to his memory, and on the Saturday closest to 26 June each year a memorial service is held at the crash site. Blumer&#x27;s portrait, and four information panels, hang in the village pub.

<doc id="1126863" wikidata="Q458075" url="?curid=1126863" title="Grignan-Les Adhemar AOC">
<text>The Grignan-Les Adhemar AOC (formerly the Côteaux du Tricastin) is the northernmost wine-growing AOC in the southern area of the Rhône wine region of France. The wines are produced in 21 communes in the department of Drôme on the east bank of the Rhône River in a triangle bounded by Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux, Montélimar, and Grignan; opposite the Côtes du Vivarais AOC on the right bank. the vineyards straddle both the true Mediterranean and the continental climatic regions where in this part of France the transition is rapid, winter snow being frequent in Montélimar but rare some 20 - 30 kilometres further south. In this transitional area between the northern and southern Rhône wine regions that constitutes the northern limit of the Provence, the climate in Baume-le-Transit and St Paul are more typically Mediterranean climate than the slightly cooler areas dominated by the Lance mountain.

According to archeological finds, particularly the remains of the largest Roman wine villa in Donzère dating from the 1st century BC, wine has been produced in the region since the antiquity. Tricastin wines were mentioned in the writings of the Marquise de Sevigné in the 16th century. The wines were accorded an AOVDQS on 19 March 1964, and were awarded their AOC on 27 July 1973.

==Wines==
A characteristic of the wines from this appellation is their great diversity due to the many and mixed soil types and varied climates. The central part of the region comprises sandstone hills, while the southeast is covered with stones or gravel. The west is mainly alluvial soil with calcairous stones, and the north is covered with large glacial pebbles.

Red wines which comprise 95% of the total production, are made from the principal varieties of Grenache noir and Syrah (10% minimum), with secondary varieties of Cinsault, Mourvèdre Carignan. No single variety may be present at more than 80%. A non defined quantity of secondary varieties must not exceed 30%, or if declared separately, not more than 15% each.

Rosé: The same varieties in the same permitted proportions are used as for the red.

White wines are produced from Grenache blanc, Roussanne, Clairette blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne, and Viognier. No variety may be present in excess of 60%

All wines must contain a minimum of 11% alcohol.

==Economy==
The Grignan-Les Adhemar wines are produced by a total of 324 concerns which include 307 growers, 49 private wineries, 13 cooperative wineries, and 8 producer/merchants. INAO statistics show that in 2007, 94,961 hectolitres were produced from 2,566 cultivated at an average yield of 52 hectolitres per hectare.

The wines are produced in 21 communes of the Drôme département at the northern limit of the Provence: 
Allan, Baume de Transit, Chamaret, Chantemerle-lès-Grignan, Châteauneuf-du-Rhône, Clansayes, Comonzelle, Donzère, Garde-Adhémar, Granges-Gontardes, Grignan, Malataverne, Montségur-sur-Lauzon, Reauville, Roche-Saint-Secret-Béconne, Roussas, Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux, Saint Restitut, Salles-sous-Bois, Solérieux, Valaurie.

==Name change==

Following an accident at the Tricastin Nuclear Power Plant in July 2008, when uranium was released, the sale of Coteaux du Tricastin wine decreased. The wine growers therefore wished to change the name of the appellation to something without &quot;Tricastin&quot;, to avoid being associated with the nuclear power plant. In June 2010, INAO signalled its intention to allow a name change to &quot;Grignan-Les Adhemar&quot; effective from the 2010 vintage.

<doc id="1126864" wikidata="Q952047" url="?curid=1126864" title="Yuta Tabuse">
<text>is a Japanese professional basketball player for Utsunomiya Brex of the B.League. A point guard, Tabuse is and . He was the first Japanese-born player to appear in a National Basketball Association (NBA) game.

Tabuse has enjoyed popularity in Japan since his high school playing days, when he led his school to three straight national championships, and has been referred to as &quot;the Michael Jordan of Japan&quot; for his celebrity status.

==Career==

===Early years===
Tabuse, who was born in Yokohama and grew up in what he calls &quot;a sports family&quot;, began playing basketball at the age of nine, because he was not good at baseball and not interested in soccer. He attended Noshiro Technical High School in Akita Prefecture, where he led his team to national championships all three years he was there and lost only a single game.

After graduation from high school in March 1999, Tabuse chose to enroll at Brigham Young University-Hawaii for its English as an International Language program. He sat out his first two seasons at BYUH because of eligibility rules and played one season before turning pro. He averaged 7.6 points per game and led the Pacific West Conference with 6.6 assists.

Tabuse returned to join the Toyota Alvark, with whom he won the Japan Basketball League Rookie of the Year award for the 2002–03 season.

===NBA, ABA and NBA D-League===
After leaving the Toyota Alvark in 2003, Tabuse became the first Japanese national to play in the NBA&#x27;s summer league, playing six games in the Rocky Mountain Revue for the Dallas Mavericks, averaging 4.5 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 13 minutes per game. Tabuse&#x27;s first attempt at making it to the NBA made the headlines in Japan, and drew large media attention. On September 27 of that year, Tabuse joined the Denver Nuggets&#x27; training camp, but he was waived on October 24, before the start of the regular season.

Tabuse spent the 2003–04 season with the American Basketball Association champion Long Beach Jam, averaging 5.3 points, 2.4 rebounds, and a team-high 6.3 assists per game in 18 games.

In 2004, Tabuse joined the Phoenix Suns&#x27; training camp and made the opening night roster. He scored seven points in his first NBA game against the Atlanta Hawks on November 3, 2004, becoming on that day the first Japanese player ever to play in an NBA regular season game. However, he was waived by the Suns on December 16, 2004, after playing in four games and rejoined the Jam for the remainder of the ABA season. Suns assistant coach Marc Iavaroni said of Tabuse: &quot;I liked his energy, I liked his courage.&quot;

Those four games with Phoenix ended up being Tabuse&#x27;s only playing time in the NBA throughout his professional basketball career. His 4th and final game in the NBA was played on December 15, 2004, in a 108 - 86 win over the Utah Jazz. Tabuse only played for 2 minutes and recorded no stats.

In 2005, Tabuse signed with the Los Angeles Clippers, but was waived before the start of the regular season. That fall, Tabuse appeared on a limited edition cover of &quot;NBA Live&quot; video game in Japan, even though he did not play a single NBA regular season game. That year, he was drafted by the Albuquerque Thunderbirds of the NBA Development League (D-League) and averaged 6.5 points and 4.0 assists in 34 games before he was waived on March 16, 2006. Michael Cooper, former NBA player and Tabuse&#x27;s coach with the Albuquerque Thunderbirds, said of him, &quot;He automatically changes the game because of his quickness and distributing the ball. He&#x27;s the best fundamental player I&#x27;ve seen around in a long time.&quot;
In 2006, Tabuse decided to forsake an opportunity to play with the Japanese national team in the world championships that took place between August 19 to September 3 across five cities in Japan, and instead play with the Dallas Mavericks&#x27; summer league team. In November 2006, Tabuse was drafted into the NBA D-League with the 11th pick of the third round (35th overall) by the Bakersfield Jam.
In November 2007, Tabuse was cut by the Bakersfield Jam before the 2007–08 season.

On December 8, 2007, Tabuse was acquired by the Anaheim Arsenal of the D-League, and he made his debut on December 9 against the Bakersfield Jam, scoring 4 points and adding 3 assists in almost 13 minutes of play. For the 2007–08 season, Tabuse averaged 4.5 points, 1.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 39 games.

In July 2008, Tabuse joined the New Jersey Nets&#x27; squad in the Orlando Pro Summer League.

===Return to Japan===
In August 2008, Tabuse signed for Japan Basketball League side Link Tochigi Brex. Tochigi&#x27;s head coach Mitsuhiko Kato was in charge of the basketball club of Noshiro Technical High School when Tabuse played for the school.

In April 2009, Tabuse was named to the 22-man roster for the Japan national basketball team. The team played at the FIBA Asia Championship for Men. In May 2009, ESPN reported that Tabuse would leave the national team after receiving an invitation by the Dallas Mavericks to compete in their summer camp.

In 2010, his team won the JBL Basketball League championship game. Tabuse was named Finals MVP. Tabuse&#x27;s team would later win their second Japanese League championship in 2017 under the rebranded Japanese Professional Basketball League. Tabuse continues to play basketball professionally into his forties.

<text>Ventoux AOC (; known as &quot;Côtes du Ventoux AOC&quot; until 2008) is a wine-growing AOC in the southeastern region of the Rhône wine region of France, where the wines are produced in 51 communes of the Vaucluse &quot;département&quot; along the lower slopes of the Ventoux mountain and at the foot of the Vaucluse Mountains. The neighbouring appellation of Luberon AOC stretches along its southern border and is separated from it by the Calavon river.

The three main areas of the region, the Malaucène basin, the foothills of the Mont Ventoux to the east of Carpentras and to the north of Cavaillon are less ravaged by the Mistral due to some shelter afforded by the Ventoux-Vaucluse-Luberon mountain range.
Archeological discoveries of wine making equipment have dated that wine has been produced in the area at least since around 30 AD.

==Wines==

Red and rosé wines are made from Grenache, Syrah, Cinsault, Mourvèdre, and Carignan (maximum 30%). Other varieties which may be used to a maximum of 20%.The red wine is distinctly characterised by its aromas of black fruit, spice, and pepper. 
White wines are produced from Clairette blanche, Bourboulenc, Grenache blanc, and Roussane (maximum 30%). 
A Primeur wine is also produced in all three colours.
The minimum alcoholic content for all wines is decreed at 11%.
The reds, which comprise approximately 80% of the production, are light and fruity. All wines are generally consumed while they are still young.

==Economy==
The Ventoux wines are produced by a total of 1,339 concerns which include 1,315 growers, 113 private wineries, 16 cooperative wineries, and 8 producer/merchants.

The vineyards are in the communes of Apt, Aubignan, Beaumettes, Beaumont-du-Ventoux, Bédoin, Blauvac, Bonnieux, Cabrières-d&#x27;Avignon, Caromb, Carpentras, Caseneuve, Crestet, Crillon-le-Brave, Entrechaux, Flassan, Fontaine-de-Vaucluse, Gargas, Gignac, Gordes, Goult, Joucas, Lagnes, La Roque-sur-Pernes, Le Barroux, Le Beaucet, Lioux, Loriol-du-Comtat, Malaucène, Malemort-du-Comtat, Maubec, Mazan, Méthamis, Modène, Mormoiron, Murs, Pernes, Robion, Roussillon, Rustrel, Saignon, Saumane, Saint-Didier, Saint-Hippolyte-le-Graveyron, Saint-Martin-de-Castillon, Saint-Pantaléon, Saint-Pierre-de-Vassols, Saint-Saturnin-lès-Apt, Venasque, Viens, Villars and Villes-sur-Auzon.

<doc id="1126868" wikidata="Q1151015" url="?curid=1126868" title="Côtes du Vivarais AOC">
<text>Côtes du Vivarais () is a wine-growing AOC in the northwestern extreme of the southern Rhône wine region of France. The wines are produced in 9 communes of the Ardèche department, and in 5 communes of the department of the Gard. The region is bisected by the deep Gorges of the Ardèche and is shares the same latitudes as the Coteaux de Tricastin AOC on the left bank of the Rhône. The wine became a VDQS in 1962 and was awarded the Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée in 1999.

==Wines==
Red wines account for 80% of the production and are made from Grenache noir minimum 30%, and Syrah, minimum 40% with carignan at less than 10% (until the harvest of 2017), and Cinsault at less than 10% (from the harvest of 2018) as secondary varieties.

Rosé wines account for 15% of the production and are made from Grenache noir, Syrah and Cinsault at .

White wines comprise 5% of the production and are made from Clairette blanche, Grenache blanc, Marsanne.

==Economy==
Wines have been produced in the region for over 2,000 years. In the region extending from the Rhône valley to the Cévennes and the Ardèche mountains - both foothills of the Massif Central - vines were cultivated by the Helvians, an ancient Gallic tribe. Pliny the Elder reported about a vine in Helvie “that flowers in a day, which protects it from accidents”; the region would wait however, until the Middle Ages before the production was well established and the wine became well known. With the planting of the traditional Rhône valley varieties of Grenache noir, Syrah, Grenache blanc and Marsanne in the early second half of the 20th century, cooperative wineries were formed to increase production to a commercial scale. The Côtes du Vivarais wines are produced on a total of 554 hectares by 149 concerns which include 138 growers, 22 small private wineries, and the 11 cooperative wineries which cater for about 90% of the production.

The vineyards are at an altitude of 250 metres on either side of the gorge and are located in the Ardèche communes of Bidon, Gras, Labastide-de-Virac, Lagorce, Larnas, Orgnac-l&#x27;Aven, Saint-Montan, Saint-Remèze, and Vinezac, and in the Gard communes of Barjac, Le Garn, Issirac, Montclus, and Saint-Privat-de-Champclos.

Centuries later, it became an important place under the French monarchy, as a royal hotel. It would also be used as a post relay, the first one on the road to Fontainebleau. It became a major road and railway junction in the 1840s after its railway station was built in 1840, and after 1893 was the first city surrounding Paris with a bridge crossing the river Seine.

Most of the city was destroyed in April 1944 by an Allied bombing as the city was the only one surrounding Paris that had such a big railway station and had railway lines going to most of France&#x27;s major cities. It was then rebuilt between 1945 and the 1970s.

The city is today known for Gare de Juvisy, the fourth largest and most-frequented railway station in the Grand Paris.

==History==
Starting from 1883, Juvisy-sur-Orge is the location of astronomer Camille Flammarion&#x27;s observatory, which today belongs to the Société astronomique de France.
The town is also the site of the 1740 Pyramid erected to memorialize the work of Jean Picard and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in measuring the Earth&#x27;s circumference.

<doc id="1126872" wikidata="Q7878295" url="?curid=1126872" title="Uki, New South Wales">
<text>Uki ( ) is a village situated near Mount Warning in the Tweed Valley of far northern New South Wales, Australia in the Tweed Shire. At the , Uki had a population of 765 people. Its name may have come from an aboriginal word for &quot;small water plant (like a fern) with a yellow flower and edible root&quot;. The name UKI was actually derived from the limber mills in the area. Prime timber for export was marked UK 1, as in timber destined for the United Kingdom - grade 1. Hence UK1, which colloquially named the township UKI.

There are three approaches to Uki village; from the North it is approximately 15 minutes by road south of the main township of Murwillumbah along the Kyogle Road and 4 km past the turnoff to the World Heritage listed Mount Warning National Park, from the South West along the Kyogle Road from Lismore, Kyogle and Nimbin and from the East along Smiths Creek Road linking Uki to the village of Stokers Siding and the Tweed Valley Way to coastal towns including Brunswick Heads and Byron Bay. It is also possible to travel to Mullumbimby from Uki using gravel back roads and fire trails through the Mount Jerusalem National Park.

Clarrie Hall Dam is located 10 km from Uki, and the area is described as &quot;one of New South Wales’ finest fishing destinations&quot;.

==Today==
Prominent buildings in the village include the historical &#x27;Old Butter Factory&#x27; and a primary school. There are several stores, including a post office, general store, bakery, pharmacy, and laundromat, as well as cafés. The Mount Warning Hotel is a weekend lunch &#x27;stop-over&#x27; for touring motorbikes and those out for a weekend drive. It burned down in February 2013, but was re-built and was able to re-open in mid-2015.
Uki is the place on which the village of &quot;Yurriki&quot; in Robert G. Barrett&#x27;s book &quot;The Godson&quot; is based.

==History==
Early pioneers were either timber cutters (usually Australian Red Cedar) or dairy farmers. Photos of The Sisters and Mt Uki near Uki in the early 1900s show these cleared of nearly all vegetation.

Following a rationalisation of the dairy industry in the 1960s, many farmers stopped their production of milk and turned to beef cattle. This type of farming remains a feature of the region today. Sugarcane farming is a prominent agricultural activity in the Tweed Valley. Tropical fruits have also been grown in the area. The last remaining sawmill is located on Smith&#x27;s Creek Road, north east of the village.

==Demographics==

In the , Uki recorded a population of 765 people, 50.5% female and 49.5% male.

The median age of the Uki population was 45 years, 8 years above the national median of 37.

73.4% of people living in Uki were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were England 6%, New Zealand 3.7%, United States of America 1.3%, Netherlands 0.7%, France 0.5%.

88.5% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 1.6% German, 0.5% Hebrew, 0.4% French, 0.4% Swedish, 0.4% Spanish.

==Sport==

The Uki Pythons Soccer Club is located just out of Uki and most of the players are from the village. In 2015, Uki had 2 Senior Men&#x27;s teams, 1 Senior Women&#x27;s team, 5 Junior competitive teams (including 1 all girls team) and 6 Junior Miniroos Teams. The club&#x27;s colours are Dark Green with Yellow trim or Yellow Shirt with Green trim and Dark Green shorts and socks.
Uki also offers community touch football through the summer months. All teams are local and various levels of ability are represented. Ages range from 6 to 60.

<doc id="1126874" wikidata="Q3242328" url="?curid=1126874" title="Lirac AOC">
<text>Lirac () is a wine-growing &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the department of Gard situated in the low hills along the right bank of the Rhône river in the southern Rhône wine region of France. It is named after the village of Lirac. Bordering on the neighbouring cru of Tavel AOC, a rosé-only cru in the next village, Lirac is one of the 13 crus of the Rhône valley family. Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC is across the Rhône from it.

==History==
Lirac wines were appreciated by the royal and papal courts in Avignon at the time of the schism. Pope Innocent VI ordered 20 casks of wine from there in 1357 and Henry IV of France and Louis XIV served them regularly at court, where they were called simple Rhône wine. In the mid-17th century the right-bank district of the Côte du Rhône had issued regulations to govern the quality of its wine and in 1737 the king ordered that casks of Lirac wine shipped from the nearby river port of Roquemaure should be branded with the letters CDR to introduce a system of protecting its origin. The rules for its &quot;Côte du Rhône&quot; thus formed the very early basis of today&#x27;s nationwide AOC system governed by the INAO. Production was very high in those days: in 1774 the vintage yielded more than 8000 hl. of wine. In 1863 phylloxera arrived in Lirac. In fact, a winemaker at Château de Clary may have been responsible for introducing it.
The name was changed to Côtes du Rhône when the left-bank wines were included in the appellation some hundred years later. The appellation received full recognition by a High Court decision in 1937. In the 1930s, Count Henri de Régis, the owner of the Château de Ségriès in the heart of the village of Lirac improved the quality of his wines until in 1945 he obtained the highest distinction, a cru, of the Côtes du Rhône. Two years later in 1947 the appellation was confirmed by government decree. Lirac is the oldest wine in the Côtes du Rhône region and was the first to be produced in all three colours: red, rosé, and white.

In recent years, the planted vineyard area of Lirac has been increasing, and more high-quality wines are being produced.

==Climate and geography==
The village of Lirac lies to the west of the Rhone in the department of Gard, a little over 10 km due west of Châteauneuf-du-Pape which is on the opposite side of the river. Besides Lirac itself, the appellation includes the villages of Saint Laurent des Arbres, Saint Géniès de Comolas and Roquemaure which forms a girdle around the appellation. The terroir in Lirac is somewhat similar to Châteauneuf-du-Pape both in variety and hours of sun (2700). The best terroir for red wine is perhaps on the windy plateau &quot;Vallongue&quot;, shared with Tavel that is only 5 km. away. In the relatively newly planted vineyards one finds plenty of &quot;galets roulés&quot; that retain heat. The area is slightly cooler that the lowlands.

==Wines==
Red wines are made from Grenache noir (minimum 40%), Syrah and Mourvèdre (minimum of 25% together), Cinsault, and Carignan (maximum 10%).
Rosé: The same varieties are used as for the red, and up to 20% of the allowed varieties for white wine may be used.

White wines are produced from Clairette, Grenache blanc and Bourboulenc. No variety may be used in a proportion greater than 60%.

The minimum alcohol for all three colours is decreed at 11.5%.

The style of red Lirac often resembles a soft Côtes du Rhône-Villages, but the more ambitious wines are often similar to Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Rosé Lirac is usually similar to Tavel.

==Economy==
The Lirac wines are produced by a total of 100 concerns which include 93 growers, 43 private wineries, 6 cooperative wineries, and one producer/merchant. Many producers in Châteauneuf-du-Pape also produce Lirac wine.

The vineyards are located in the four communes of Lirac, Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres, Saint-Geniès-de-Comolas, and Roquemaure.

<doc id="1126876" wikidata="Q6407350" url="?curid=1126876" title="Killbear Provincial Park">
<text>Killbear Provincial Park is a provincial park located on Georgian Bay in the Parry Sound District of Ontario, near the town of Nobel. Killbear combines sandy beaches typical of the Great Lakes with the rock ridges and pines of the Canadian Shield. The park boundaries lie within the Georgian Bay Littoral UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

==Nature and ecology==
The park is ecologically significant for its large and varied types of shoreline. As water levels in the Great Lakes fluctuate over a time span of decades, different wetland, meadow and shoreline vegetation types are created. High levels of human activity can damage natural shoreline ecosystems; currently only small areas of natural beach remain intact in this park.

The wetlands of the park also support significant animal species including spotted turtles, Blanding&#x27;s turtles and eastern massasauga rattlesnakes. Uplands support both the hognose snake and five-lined skink, both of which are considered species of special concern. There is also a population of fox snakes, which use offshore islands extensively, and overwinter in hibernacula in the area.

The southeastern portion of the park protects a typical area of bedrock barrens; these barrens represent a distinctive shallow soil habitat type found in eastern Georgian Bay. The park is one area within a larger significant landscape, the 30,000 islands along the eastern coast of Georgian Bay, which comprise the world&#x27;s largest freshwater archipelago.

===&quot;The Killbear Tree&quot;===

Killbear Provincial Park features a &quot;&quot; windswept isolated white pine growing on a rock outcrop. In 2019, after a major limb died over two years, the tree began showing signs of damage. Following a major ice storm, the tree had two support rods installed in 2022.

==History==
The area that is now Killbear Provincial Park was extensively logged for about 20 years, starting in 1900. The land was expropriated by the Ontario Government and designated a provincial park in 1960.

==Facilities and activities==
Activities in the park include camping, swimming, boating, cycling and fishing. The park&#x27;s proximity to southern Ontario make it very popular, especially in peak season, and reservations are often necessary despite its large number of campsites. The campgrounds are divided into campsites which are often focused on a feature such as a beach. They include: Beaver Dams, Blind Bay, Georgian, Granite Saddle, Harold Point, Kilcoursie Bay, and Lighthouse.

<text>Sir Trevor David Brooking (born 2 October 1948) is a former England international footballer, manager, pundit and football administrator; he now works as director of football development in England.

Brooking spent almost his entire career at West Ham United, making 647 appearances for the club. He won the 1975 FA Cup and the 1980 FA Cup in which he scored the only goal. He was also the club&#x27;s player of the season on four occasions and caretaker manager on two occasions in 2003. Brooking played 47 times for England, scoring five times. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1981, elevated to Commander of same order (CBE) in 1999, and knighted in 2004. In 2009, a stand at Upton Park was named after him. Since retiring from playing, he has taken up a number of positions in broadcasting as an on-air analyst and in football and sports administration.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Trevor David Brooking was born on 2 October 1948 in Barking, Essex, to mother Margaret and father Henry Charles (known as Harry), who was a police officer in the Metropolitan Police. Brooking attended Ripple Infants School and left Ilford County High School with 11 O-levels and 2 A-levels. His father took him to see his first West Ham United game at Upton Park, a 1–1 draw against Liverpool on 19 April 1958, when he was nine years old. Aged fifteen he trained at both Tottenham and Chelsea. However, West Ham manager Ron Greenwood watched him with scout Wally St Pier, and Brooking was offered apprenticeships by all three clubs, with only West Ham allowing him to stay on at school to finish his studies. Despite his parents being offered £500 and a car by manager Tommy Docherty to gain his signature for Chelsea he remained at school signing an apprenticeship deal with West Ham on 24 July 1965, his parents receiving no fee.

In June 1967, Brooking made his senior debut in a friendly for West Ham against Grasshopper Zürich in Switzerland. His league debut came in place of wide-right Brian Dear on 29 August 1967 in a 3–3 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. His first goal came on 26 December 1967 in a 4–2 away win at Leicester City. His first season saw him play 28 games, scoring nine goals. His second season saw 37 appearances and eight goals. His only hat-trick came on 6 April 1968 in a 5–0 home defeat of Newcastle. 

In December 1969, during his third season, Brooking chipped a bone in his ankle in a game against Nottingham Forest. The club signed Peter Eustace for £90,000 to take his place; his recovery took longer than expected, and he considered giving up the game. However, he returned to playing and with the departure of Martin Peters to Tottenham in March 1970, Brooking became a regular in midfield. His place in the side came under threat in the 1971–72 season with the purchase of midfielder Tommy Taylor, and Brooking was transfer-listed at his request. However, the failure of the defensive partnership between Bobby Moore and Alan Stephenson saw Stephenson dropped and Taylor being moved into defence; Brooking remained an ever-present for the rest of the season and was voted Hammer of the Year. 

During the 1972–73 season he came to the attention of Derby County manager Brian Clough, who offered West Ham £400,000 for Brooking and Moore. However, Greenwood refused to let the pair leave. Again, in 1974 Tottenham manager Bill Nicholson offered £425,000 for the signature of Brooking. According to Brooking in his autobiography, this move was not pursued as he felt Nicholson, a manager he admired, was coming to the end of his Tottenham career and was unsure which manager would follow him.

He won the FA Cup twice, in 1975 with Brooking scoring a vital goal in a 2–1 win in a fourth round replay away at Swindon Town and 1980; in the latter, he scored another vital goal in a 2–1 win in a third round replay against West Bromwich Albion and the only goal in a 1–0 win over Arsenal in the final with a header. Brooking scored what was considered goal of the year in the Golden Goals Competition on ITV, according to the panel (Dave Sexton, Pat Jennings, Vic Railton and Bernard Joy) for the 1976 British League season. 

Brooking was a member of the West Ham team which won the Second Division in 1981. He also appeared in the 1975 FA Charity Shield, the 1976 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final, the 1980 FA Charity Shield and the 1981 Football League Cup Final. His last game for West Ham came on 18 May 1984 in 1–0 home defeat by Everton. In total he made 647 appearances and scoring 102 times, wearing the number 10 jersey, his total appearances for West Ham beaten only by Billy Bonds, Bobby Moore and Frank Lampard Sr. He had a testimonial match against an England XI in October 1977.

===Later career===
During the 1984 New Zealand National Soccer League season, Brooking made a single appearance for Manurewa, playing in a 2–2 draw against Auckland University.

Brooking accepted an invitation to play for Blue Star in a Wearside League game against Coundon on 28 April 1985. Blue Star had paid for him to fly to Newcastle as their guest and reportedly paid him an appearance fee of £500.

In 1985, Brooking played six times for Western Australian club Kelmscott, also helping to coach the club&#x27;s youth sides.

Later that year, Brooking played briefly for Cork City, making two appearances.

==International career==
Brooking made his England debut on 3 April 1974 in a 0–0 draw against Portugal. He played 47 times, scoring five goals but only appeared twice in major tournaments. At Euro 1980 in Italy he played in England&#x27;s opening game against Belgium which was a 1–1 draw, but was dropped for the second game, against Italy which England lost 1–0. Re-instated to the starting eleven against Spain he scored England&#x27;s first goal in a 2–1 win. Due to injury World Cup 1982 was to see him limited to playing as a substitute against Spain on 5 July 1982. Playing for only the last half-hour of the game, Brooking forced one excellent save from the Spanish goalkeeper, Luis Arconada, but with England needing to win to qualify for the semi-final a 0–0 draw saw them eliminated. This was to be his final international appearance.

==Style of play==
Brooking was primarily right-footed, but was comfortable on his left foot, due to repeated practice. He played as an attacking midfield player, known for his controlled passing and midfield authority. Early in his career he was vulnerable to being out-muscled by opposition players (leading his teammates to nickname him &#x27;Cyril&#x27; after Cyril Lord the carpet salesman, as Ron Greenwood told him &quot;you&#x27;re always on the floor&quot;). He lacked pace, leading to another nickname, Boog, after a slow baseball player called Boog Powell the team had witnessed during a tour of the US. He was rarely booked or sent off during his West Ham career and due to his gentlemanly approach to the game where he rarely contested a referee&#x27;s decision he picked up another nickname, Hadleigh, after a television upper class and urbane detective played by Gerald Harper.

==Managerial career==
In April 2003, after West Ham manager Glenn Roeder collapsed due to a brain tumour, Brooking, having long been on the board at West Ham, briefly took over as caretaker manager. The club were fighting relegation from the Premier League. Brooking took charge of three games. His first game resulted in a 1–0 win at Manchester City with a goal from Frédéric Kanouté. His second saw West Ham beat Chelsea 1–0, with a goal from Paolo Di Canio. The final game of the season saw West Ham draw 2–2 at Birmingham City resulting in relegation, albeit with 42 points, a record number for a relegated team in a 38-game season. 

After the first three games of the 2003–04 season with West Ham now in the First Division, Roeder was sacked after West Ham suffered an away defeat to Rotherham United and Brooking was again installed as caretaker manager. He managed for eleven games, losing only once, to Gillingham, a 2–0 away defeat in which Jermain Defoe was sent off. In October 2003 he was replaced by Alan Pardew, who was appointed on his recommendation.

==Media career==
In 1984, Brooking joined the BBC as a pundit, and has featured on radio and television commentary since, including the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and coverage of World Cups and European Championships. He was also the co-commentator in the &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; video game series, alongside Peter Brackley until &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 6&quot;.

==Football administration==
Brooking was chair of the Eastern Region Council for Sport and Recreation from 1987 until 1997, and between 1999 and 2002 he was chairman of Sport England. In January 2004, he joined the Football Association as Director of Football Development, a role which gave him control of coaching and development in English football, as well as a role in appointing future England managers.

He was a key part of the selection process for the successor of Sven-Göran Eriksson, revealed in May 2006 to be Steve McClaren. In 2004, he was knighted for his services to sport.

==Personal life==
Brooking says he has an &quot;aversion to alcohol,&quot; having &quot;discovered in early life that it wasn&#x27;t for me.&quot;

In June 1970, he married Hilkka, a Finnish au pair. The couple have two children: Collette and Warren.

In 1970, along with schoolfriend Colin McGowan, Brooking started a book binding company, Colbrook Plastics Limited in Stratford, East London. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Essex in 2001. In October 2014, his autobiography, &quot;Trevor Brooking, My Life in Football&quot;, was published.

==Legacy==
===Sir Trevor Brooking Stand===
In 2009 West Ham United announced that from 8 August, the start of the 2009/10 Premier League Season, &#x27;The Centenary Stand&#x27; at Upton Park would be named &#x27;The Sir Trevor Brooking Stand&#x27; in his honour. The stand was used by away supporters and had been the scene for crowd disturbances. In 2009 in a match between West Ham and Millwall seats were torn out by Millwall fans and hurled towards West Ham fans. In subsequent seasons, Millwall fans were segregated to the upper tier of the stand and kept at least 30 yards from West Ham fans to prevent crowd disturbances. A stand at the London Stadium is also named after Brooking and used by West Ham after their move from the Boleyn Ground from the start of the 2016–17 season.

<text>Riverwood is a suburb in South Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Riverwood is located 19 kilometres southwest of the Sydney central business district and is part of the St George area and is part of the Canterbury-Bankstown Region. Riverwood is split between the local government areas of the Georges River Council and the City of Canterbury-Bankstown.

==History==
The area was originally known as Herne Bay and comprised small land grants between 30 and . When the East Hills railway line came through the area in 1931, the station was called Herne Bay. The area was subdivided in 1919 and redeveloped in 1942 during World War 2, when the Government of Australia and the Allied Works Council establish an army base hospital barracks for the United States Army, the 118 General Hospital. The hospital was built at a cost of one-million pounds and consisted of 490 barrack type buildings containing approximately four-thousand-two-hundred and fifty beds. The hospital was staffed by doctors and nurses from The Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.

The Americans, who at the time, were using the Hydro Majestic Hotel in Medlow Bath as a hospital, relocated and moved into the first section of the Herne Bay premises in May 1943. By November, 1700 beds were being utilised. The site was visited by General MacArthur, First Lady Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt, Artie Shaw&#x27;s Band and Bob Hope. In October 1944, the main US hospital left for the liberation of the Philippines, although some American patients and staff remained on site until January 1945. In that same month, the Royal Navy (United Kingdom) opened a hospital to treat wounded members of the British Pacific Fleet in the vacated buildings. It received and treated 9003 patients. The Australian army occupied some of the other sections. One of the sections in use was located in Cullens Road, between Canterbury Road and Wiggs Roads Punchbowl and used up until March 1947.

After the war the military departed, and the hospital barrack buildings of timber and corrugated iron (some of which still survive today) were handed over to the Housing Commission from March 1946 and converted into public housing to relieve housing shortages. Some of the street names recall the American presence such as Pennsylvania Road, Kentucky Road, Wyoming Place, Idaho Place, Michigan Road, Montana Crescent, Roosevelt Avenue and Truman Avenue. Now the Herne Bay Hospital is the headquarters for the Australian Air League Riverwood Squadron.

The suburb developed an unsavoury reputation for poverty, overcrowding and violence, and its name was changed to Riverwood in 1957, in large part to remove the stigma associated with living there. This helped to change the reputation of the area. From the 1950s onwards, purpose-built utilitarian public housing apartment blocks and freestanding bungalows replaced most of the former military buildings on the northern side of the railway line, while the southern part of the suburb was mostly privately developed.

==Population==
In the 2021 Census, there were 12,793 people in Riverwood. 38.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common places of birth were Mainland China 18.3%, Philippines 3.0%, Lebanon 2.8%, Vietnam 2.8% and Hong Kong 2.7%. 31.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 14.8%, Cantonese 13.0%, Arabic 7.5%, Vietnamese 2.9% and Indonesian 2.4%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 30.3%, Catholic 19.6% and Islam 10.7%.


==Transport==
Riverwood railway station is on the East Hills railway line. With Padstow to the west and Narwee to the east. Riverwood is approximately a 35 minute commute to CBD via public transport. 

Although the buses of Punchbowl Bus Company are stabled at their headquarters on Hannans Road Riverwood, the suburb itself does not act as a bus terminus. For details of bus routes see Riverwood Station

The M5 South Western Motorway crosses Belmore Road in Riverwood, offering on- and off-ramps for northeast-bound and southwest-bound traffic.

<doc id="1126881" wikidata="Q6554878" url="?curid=1126881" title="Linton, Kent">
<text>Linton is a village and civil parish in the Maidstone District of Kent, England. The parish is located on the southward slope of the Greensand ridge, south of Maidstone on the A229 Hastings road.

The name Linton comes from Old English, probably meaning &quot;Lilla&#x27;s village&quot;. The village has a population of about 500.

St Nicholas Church is a Grade II* listed building.

Linton Park is a Grade I listed mansion to the east of the village. Built in 1730 by Robert Mann, it was later home to Sir Horatio Mann, the fourth and fifth Earls Cornwallis and Fiennes Cornwallis, 1st Baron Cornwallis. It served as headquarters to the army encampment at neighbouring Coxheath during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
There is one public house &#x27;The Bull&#x27; which is opposite the church. There is a children&#x27;s playground off a lane near the bottom of the hill which can be found at the end of a path just above the turning for Wheelers Lane. Cornwallis Academy is a secondary school in the village.

Linton Park Cricket Club play within the grounds of Linton Park country home. The team have won the National Village Cup on two occasions.

Linton is in a conservation area and most of the village has views across to the Weald of Kent.

<doc id="1126884" wikidata="Q3516286" url="?curid=1126884" title="Tavel AOC">
<text>Tavel () is a wine-growing &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; in the southern Rhône wine region of France, across the Rhône River from Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC and just north of Avignon. Tavel wines are all rosé wines and must have a minimum alcohol content of 11%. The 933 hectares produce an average yield of 42 hectolitres per hectare The vineyards are located in the commune of Tavel only.

Tavel is reputed to have been a favourite wine of kings Philippe le Bel and Louis XIV, the Popes of Avignon, the 19th century novelist, Honoré de Balzac, the 20th-century writer, Ernest Hemingway, and is one of the few rosé wines that can benefit from aging.

==History==
The wine of Tavel is historically famous. Philip IV is supposed to have travelled through Tavel on one of his tours of the kingdom. He was reportedly offered a glass, which he emptied without getting off his horse and afterwards proclaimed Tavel the only good wine in the world. The Sun King, Louis XIV, is also supposed to have been fond of the wine, which helped maintain its reputation until the vineyards were affected by the phylloxera epidemic. Tavel achieved AOC status in 1936 when the system was introduced. At that point the grapes were mostly grown on the sandy flat lands closer to town, where vines were easier to cultivate but produced a lower quality of wine. In 1965 the hillsides were cleared of forest and prepared for growing vines.

==Climate and geography==
In Tavel there are three types of soil. One west of the village is dominated by limestone and slate. Here, low-yielding vines grow giving deep and aromatic wines. Another type is the flat sandy rocky fields, easy to cultivate and good for ripening. The third is dominated by &quot;galets roulés&quot;, the smooth round stones also found in Châteauneuf-du-Pape and is located east of the town in the direction of Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

==Grapes and wine==
Grenache and Cinsault are the main grapes used in the appellation&#x27;s wines, along with Syrah and Mourvedre, although the latter two were not permitted until 1969. Tavel wines are dry and tend to have more body and structure than most rosés. They can be cellared, but are usually drunk young.

===Winemaking===
Rosé wine cannot legally be made in France by blending red and white wines together. However, rosé wine can blend red and white grapes (before fermentation), pressed to remove the juice from the skins after a short period of maceration (10–36 hours) in order to extract some colour. In Tavel, some of the must is kept with the skins longer and then blended into the lighter must, which is what makes the wine more powerful, more tannic and darker than other rosés. The potential alcohol is high, with an upper limit of 14.5% for the appellation.

<doc id="1126887" wikidata="Q7888536" url="?curid=1126887" title="Vacqueyras AOC">
<text>Vacqueyras is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the southern Rhône wine region of France, along the banks of the River Ouvèze. It is primarily a red wine region with some white and rosé wines being produced. Being a little brother of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and, arguably, Gigondas, the wine is moderately prestigious and can yield pleasing results when treated correctly.

==History==
Wine has been produced in the region since the 15th century. However records are sparse, reduced to mentioning large vineyards and a decree on how to keep hungry goats away from the grapes. Vacqueyras received the A.O.C. Côtes du Rhône Decree appellation in 1937, and in 1955 was promoted to Côtes du Rhône Villages status, becoming a named village in 1967. In 1990, Vacqueyras was granted its own AOC, the first in the region since Gigondas in 1971, and the first of a number of candidates for that particular honour, recently bestowed to Beaumes-de-Venise and Vinsobres.

==Climate and geography==
Located only a few kilometers south of Gigondas, Vacqueyras shares much of the same terroir with vineyards located in altitude. The best vineyards are found on &quot;Plateau de Garrigues&quot;. In the lowland, warmer temperatures result in more powerful and often inelegant wines.

==Grapes and wine==

The bulk (97%) of the wine is red. The red wine can be much like the wines from Gigondas and at their best, the wines of Vacqueyras can match those of their northern sibling. Vacqueyras wines have been called &quot;poor man&#x27;s Châteauneuf-du-Pape&quot;.

===Winemaking===
Vacqueyras is, like Gigondas, known for its power rather than its elegance. The backbone of the wine is Grenache, however, producers of Vacqueyras use more Syrah than is used in Gigondas which can make the style seem cooler.

<text>Gigondas () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in the southern Rhône wine region of France. It is primarily a red wine region, with a very small amount of rosé wine produced. As of September 2022, the AOC Gigondas appellation was extended to include white wines. Considered a little brother to Châteauneuf-du-Pape, the wine is moderately and can age well when treated with care. Gigondas AOC wine is produced exclusively in the commune of Gigondas, in Vaucluse.

==History==
The name of the appellation is of Roman origin. &quot;Jocunditas&quot; means great pleasure and enjoyment in Latin; the town was founded as a recreational site for the soldiers from the Roman Empire Second Legion. The finding of a Bacchus-head indicates that wine was already grown at this time. Later the fields went to the church and later still, one finds the Prince of Orange to be a large land owner in the area.
As early as 1894 the wines from the region won a gold medal at the agricultural fair in Paris. But until the beginning of World War II, the wines were used as reinforcement to thin Burgundies.
In 1956, a bitter winter caused the production of wine to experience a renaissance, as the olive trees had died from the cold. In 1971 the appellation left the other Côtes du Rhône-Villages and became a proper appellation in its own right.

==Climate and geography==
Gigondas, along with the rest of Southern Rhône has a Mediterranean climate that differs from its northern neighbour, which has a more continental climate. The main geographical feature in Gigondas is the Dentelles de Montmirail, a small range of mountains that divide the appellation into two distinct areas – one with a cooler climate and one with a hotter. But elevation is also an important factor, as wine is being harvested as high as 600 meters.

==Grapes and wine==
In 1592, white wine from Gigondas is mentioned. However, no white wine is produced today. The appellation is growing red grapes only, and mostly making only red wine, though some rosé is also produced. According to the INAO, Gigondas Rouge is to be made from a maximum 80% Grenache, a minimum 15% Syrah and/or Mourvedre, and a maximum 10% from the other Rhône varieties, minus Carignan. The greatest Gigondas’ can be kept for 10 years or more in the cellar and usually benefits from at least three years in the cellar. Being primarily Grenache does, however, mean that the lesser wines are not recommended for extended bottle aging.

===Winemaking===

Gigondas is known for its power rather than its elegance. Some parts of the appellation are warmer than Châteauneuf-du-Pape, bringing the generous Grenache grape close to fortified strength in alcohol. While some rosé wine is produced, the appellation draws its prestige from its reds.

<text>The Saab 17 is a Swedish single-engine monoplane reconnaissance dive-bomber aircraft of the 1940s originally developed by ASJA prior to its merger into Saab. It was the first all-metal stressed skin aircraft developed in Sweden.

==Design and development==

The project was initiated in response to a 1938 request from the &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; (Swedish Air Force) for a reconnaissance aircraft to replace the obsolete Fokker S 6 (C.Ve) sesquiplane. Design work began at the end of the 1930s as the L 10 by ASJA, but once accepted by the &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; it was assigned the designations B 17 and S 17 for the bomber and reconnaissance versions respectively, and it became better known as the Saab 17.

The design chosen was a conventional mid-wing cantilever monoplane with a long greenhouse canopy and a single radial engine in the nose. Control surfaces were covered in fabric but the remainder was stressed-skin duraluminum. It could be fitted with wheels or skiis, both of which retracted straight to the rear along the underside of the wing, leaving prominent fairings, and when fitted with wheels the undercarriage doors could be used as dive brakes. A retractable tailwheel was provided. A floatplane version was built in small numbers for coastal reconnaissance to replace the obsolete Svenska Aero S 5, with massive fairings joining the floats to the wings where the wheels would have been. To maintain stability small vertical fins were added to the horizontal stabilizer. The wings were reinforced so that it could be used as a dive bomber. Bomb racks were provided under the wings, along with a small bomb bay below the cockpit, although some examples used a conventional rack on the centreline. On the bomber versions, a crutch was fitted to swing the bomb clear of the aircraft in vertical diving attacks, when the bomb could otherwise have passed through the propeller. The reconnaissance versions lacked the crutch. Split flaps broken into four segments were fitted to the underside trailing edge of the wing.

Two L 10 prototypes were ordered, the first being powered by a Bristol Mercury XII radial engine built by Nohab in Sweden, and the second with an imported Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp C radial.

Supplies of suitable engines remained a major problem, and resulted in the aircraft being built in three versions with different engines.
The definitive B 17A used the Swedish-built STWC-3 (Swedish Twin Wasp C-3), an unlicenced copy of the R-1830. The B 17B used a Bristol Mercury XXIV built by Svenska Flygmotor AB (SFA) in Sweden, and the B 17C used an imported Piaggio P.XI radial from Italy. The United States government denied a request to purchase a licence to build the Twin Wasp, so an unlicensed, reverse engineered copy was built instead as the STWC-3 (Swedish Twin Wasp C-3) to supplement and replace the lower powered Mercury radials already being built under licence. Until production caught up with demand, the earliest aircraft being delivered were flown to their destinations, the engines were removed and shipped back, to be used on the next aircraft to be delivered.

==Operational history==
The first flight was on 18 May 1940 and first deliveries of dive bombers to the &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; began in March 1942, while deliveries of reconnaissance versions began in June 1942, and the type was operational by September 1942 when the first exercises were carried out. Problems immediately arose with wing failures, and additional modifications were needed before it could be cleared for dive bombing, which remained limited to shallow attacks thereafter. The final aircraft was delivered on 31 August 1944.

A B 17 was used to test the ejection seat Saab had developed for use in the Saab 21 pusher fighter, which was first successfully fired on 27 February 1944 with a dummy.

Stig Wennerström gained some fame in Sweden for successfully bailing out from a B 17 from low altitude, with his gunner, but would later become a spy for the Soviet Union.

For several months in late 1944 and early 1945 fifteen B 17As were operated by the Danish Brigade in Sweden (Danforce) a unit of 5000 men (including 50 airmen) in Sweden which had been formed to assist in liberating occupied Denmark from the Nazis, and preventing the retreating German soldiers from using civilians as human shields, and carrying out scorched earth tactics as they had done elsewhere. However, due to the German surrender on 7 May 1945, the aircraft were no longer needed and were returned to &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; control a couple of months later.

Rapid advances in aviation related to improved aerodynamics, higher engine power and finally the introduction of jet engines, resulted in it having a short career, and it was gradually withdrawn from frontline service between 1948 and 1950, while the last examples were retired from secondary roles by 1954. Over the next few years, examples would be sold off to various operators.

Due to the efforts of Carl Gustaf von Rosen, the Ethiopian Air Force bought 47 which were operated from 1947 until 1968.

From 1951, 19 B 17s were loaned to &quot;Svensk Flygtjanst AB&quot; and AVIA for use as target tugs and painted yellow with civilian markings. One of these, a B 17A SE-BYF was sold to the Austrian &quot;Österreichische Luftstreitkräfte&quot; in 1957, where it continued to be used as a target tug until retired in 1963. Two B 17As were also sold to the Finnish &quot;Ilmavoimat&quot; in 1959 and 1960, also as target tugs. Neither of the Finnish aircraft lasted long before being destroyed in accidents.

==Surviving aircraft==

Five Saab 17s are known to be in existence today, three of which are on public display.

The Swedish Air Force Museum in Linköping has two aircraft in their collection, a S 17BL &#x27;5&#x27;, serial 17005 which is on static display in the museum, and a B 17A &#x27;7&#x27;, serial 17239, the latter being kept in airworthy condition and which is periodically flown.

Another B 17A &#x27;E&#x27;, serial 17320 which was donated by the Flygvapnet after having served as a target tug is on display at the Danish Museum of Science and Technology in Helsingør/Elsinore.

Two former Ethiopian B 17As were recovered in the 1990s and purchased by a South African collector as a part of a large batch of ex-Ethiopian aircraft. These were shipped to Lithuania but their current status and location is unknown following the collapse of the collector&#x27;s business interests.

<text>Tadiandamol or Thadiyandamol is the highest mountain of Madikeri taluk Kodagu district, Karnataka, India. It is the third highest peak in Karnataka, after Mullayyanagiri &amp; Kudremukha. It is located Western Ghats range, and reaches an elevation of 1,748 m. The mountain has patches of shola forests in the valleys.

The Nalaknad (also known as Nalnad - meaning 4 villages) palace at the foothills is an important historical landmark. This was one of the landmarks mapped during the Great Trigonometric Survey.

It is a place of interest for trekkers and naturalists. The climb to the top and back can be completed as a day hike(within 5hrs) and the entry is closed at 5:00 pm; camping is banned since December 2016.The best time to visit the peak is July-end to September(after monsoon) as greenery is observed well in these months.

The name Tadiandamol literally means &quot;largest base&quot; (thadi = broad, large, huge; anda = belonging to (possessive) in Kodava; mol = hill, base, peak). It loosely means &quot;Tallest Mount&quot;, and the name also could translate as &quot;Broad Hill&quot;.

<text>Salmon Hater is a fictional heavy metal band, manufactured by Adam Spencer and Wil Anderson of Triple J breakfast radio in Australia.

The name came about on air after the station had played a promo for Triple J&#x27;s metal show, &quot;Full Metal Racket&quot;. The pair had an impromptu conversation, making reference to the names of many metal bands. Anderson asked Spencer what his favourite metal band was, and Spencer, put on the spot, gave the fake name &quot;Salmon Hater&quot;, as a &quot;premier fishcore&quot; band with a lead singer named Torv.

Other details made up about the band were that they hailed from the hills of Glenelg (in Adelaide, South Australia. Glenelg is quite a flat suburb - when informed of this, Spencer stated that they were &quot;underground hills&quot;) where they were part of the local &quot;Fish Metal&quot; scene (along with other non-existent bands such as &quot;Trout Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Red Goering&quot;) and that their latest single was &quot;6.66 - One Hundredth of the Number of the Beast&quot;. The title originated from the stereotypical &quot;satanic&quot; metal theme (e.g. Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, etc.), and Spencer&#x27;s love for mathematics.

The next morning, a listener by the name of Mitch Hertz contacted Spencer and Anderson saying he was the &quot;manager&quot; of Salmon Hater and offered to bring the new single &quot;6.66&quot; into the studio for the duo to play on-air. On Friday of that week, lead singer &quot;Torv&quot; and manager Mitch Hertz gave a studio interview. That weekend, Spencer and Anderson reported seeing numerous fans wearing Salmon Hater t-shirts to the Big Day Out on the Gold Coast and in Melbourne.

Spencer and Anderson then encouraged listeners to vote for the song in the annual Triple J Hottest 100 poll, for which votes were only a few days away from closing. Many people were surprised that the track reached number 26 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2002, and some fans of other bands were upset that Anderson and Spencer had influenced the music poll. Other Triple J fans felt that the orchestrated campaign and the eventual ranking of the song reduced respect for the Hottest 100, and proved it as a sham.

The Australian music television program &quot;Rage&quot; usually plays the Hottest 100 a couple of months after the countdown. This meant there would be an opportunity for a music video to accompany the track to be broadcast. Many volunteers assembled for the filming of the music video, which was broadcast not only on &quot;Rage&quot;, but is available on the Hottest 100 Vol. 10 DVD release as well.

A few weeks later, Spencer and Anderson played a follow-up single &quot;Shark Sandwich&quot; on their show.

Salmon Hater performed a brief tour in June 2003, playing dates in Sydney and Melbourne. These were the last public appearances of the band.

Music videos were released for songs &quot;Cod Piece Face&quot; (referencing a line from a Young One&#x27;s episode) and &quot;You Are What I Eat&quot;

In 2016, the official Salmon Hater Facebook page announced that after 12 years, authorities were finally closing a &quot;missing persons&quot; case and had classified lead singer Torvald Samunhäder as legally dead. In tribute, the &quot;lost&quot; Salmon Hater album &quot;A Brief History of Salmon&quot; was released on multiple streaming services, including a re-mixed version of &quot;6.66&quot;

<doc id="1126898" wikidata="Q3419962" url="?curid=1126898" title="Rasteau AOC">
<text>Rasteau is an &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; for wine in the southern Rhône wine region of France, covering both fortified and unfortified wines. The sweet fortified wines (Vin Doux Naturel, VDN) can be red, rosé or white, and have long been produced under the Rasteau AOC. In 2010 dry red wines (unfortified) were also added to the appellation, effective from the 2009 vintage.

The Rasteau appellation covers mostly the commune of Rasteau, but also includes some vineyards in Cairanne and Sablet. of vineyards are used for the fortified wines, with an annual production of around 1,400 hectoliter, or around 190,000 bottles.

== History ==
The production of fortified wine was introduced in 1934, and in 1944, the Rasteau AOC for VDN wines was created, with effect from the 1943 vintage. Dry red wines from the same area traditionally had to be sold under the Côtes du Rhône Villages designation. From 1996, Rasteau was one of the village names that could be added to Côtes du Rhône Villages. In 2002, the Rasteau winegrower&#x27;s syndicate requested that Rasteau should become its own appellation. This was finally approved by INAO in 2010, effective from the 2009 vintage.

== Grape varieties ==

Main grape varieties for the fortified wines are Grenache noir, Grenache gris and Grenache blanc. All grape varieties allowed for red, rosé or white Côtes du Rhône (a total of 18 varieties in addition to the Grenaches) are also allowed as accessory grape varieties for Rasteau AOC, and are limited to a total of 10%. Red Rasteau is typically produced from 100% Grenache noir.

== Appellation regulations ==

The fortified wines are produced from grape which must reach a maturity of at least 252 grams sugar per liter must, or close to 15 per cent of potential alcohol, which corresponds to very mature grapes. The allowed base yield is 30 hectoliter per hectare. The wine must be fortified by the addition of neutral alcohol (with a minimum strength of 96 per cent by volume), the volume of which must correspond to 5 to 10 per cent of the volume of the grape must. The alcohol level of the finished wine must be at least 15 per cent, and a maximum of 21.5 per cent by volume, and the sugar content at least 45 grams per liter.

There are two special designations which can be used for Rasteau wines:
* Wines marked &quot;Hors d&#x27;âge&quot; must be stored for five years before it is sold.
* Wines marked &quot;Rancio&quot; must have been subjected to the typical oxidative treatment of that wine style.

<doc id="1126906" wikidata="Q4569320" url="?curid=1126906" title="Catalina affair">
<text>The Catalina affair () was a military confrontation and Cold War-era diplomatic crisis in June 1952, in which Soviet Air Force fighter jets shot down two Swedish aircraft over international waters in the Baltic Sea.

The first aircraft to be shot down was an unarmed Swedish Air Force Tp 79, a derivative of the Douglas DC-3, carrying out radio and radar signals intelligence-gathering for the National Defence Radio Establishment (&quot;Försvarets radioanstalt&quot;, FRA). None of the crew of eight survived.

The second aircraft to be shot down was a Swedish Air Force Tp 47, a Catalina flying boat, involved in the search and rescue operation for the missing DC-3. The Catalina&#x27;s crew of seven were saved.

The Soviet Union publicly denied involvement until its dissolution in 1991. Both aircraft were located in 2003; the DC-3 was salvaged.

== Aircraft and crew ==
=== DC-3 ===
The first aircraft involved was a Swedish Air Force Douglas DC-3A-360 Skytrain, a military transport derivative of the DC-3 known in Swedish service as Tp 79. It carried the serial number 79001. In the media coverage following the event, it became known simply as &quot;the DC-3.&quot;

The aircraft was manufactured in 1943 with original US serial number 42-5694, and was delivered to USAAF 15th Troop Carrier Squadron (61st Troop Carrier Group). It saw action in northern Africa before being stationed at RAF Barkston Heath. It was flown on 5 February 1946, from Orly Air Base via Hanau Army Airfield to Bromma and was registered as SE-APZ on 18 May 1946 as a civil aircraft to Skandinaviska Aero AB.
On 13 June 1952, it disappeared east of the isle of Gotska Sandön while carrying out signals intelligence-gathering operations for FRA. The aircraft was lost with its entire crew of eight in the incident. Three of the eight crew members were military personnel from the Swedish Air Force, and the other five were civilian signals intelligence (SIGINT) operators from the FRA.

=== Catalina ===

Three days after the initial incident, on 16 June 1952, two Consolidated PBY-5 Catalina flying boats, known in Swedish service as Tp 47, searched for the DC-3 north of Estonia. One of the aircraft, carrying airframe serial No. 47002, was shot down by Soviet aircraft, but the crew of seven ditched near the West German freighter &quot;Münsterland&quot; and were rescued.

== Aftermath ==
Sweden maintained for nearly 40 years that the plane was undertaking a navigation training flight.

Only after pressure from crewmembers&#x27; families did Swedish authorities confirm that the DC-3 was equipped with British equipment and had been conducting surveillance for NATO. In 1991, General , a colonel of the Soviet Air Forces in the early 1950s, admitted he had ordered the DC-3 shot down in 1952 by scrambling a MiG-15bis to intercept it.

== Recovery ==
On 10 June 2003, airline captain and former Swedish Air Force pilot, Anders Jallai, and historian Carl Douglas with the Swedish company Marin Mätteknik AB found the remains of the downed DC-3 by using sonar at depth.

After 52 years, the remains of the DC-3 were lifted to the surface on 19 March 2004. Debris from the area was also recovered by freeze dredging— of surrounding sediment was frozen and lifted together with the object on and in it. The wreck was transferred to Muskö Naval Base for investigation and preservation; it was finally put on display at the Swedish Air Force Museum, Linköping on 13 May 2009. A 1:12 scale model of 79001 was loaned to the Air Force Museum on 5 May 2009.

== Conclusion ==
Bullet holes on 79001 showed that the DC-3 was shot down by a MiG-15bis fighter. The exact splashdown time was also determined, as one of the clocks in the cockpit had stopped at 11:28:40 CET. The remains of four of the eight-man crew have been found and positively identified.

<doc id="1126907" wikidata="Q1151005" url="?curid=1126907" title="Côtes du Rhône AOC">
<text>Côtes du Rhône () is a wine-growing &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) for the Rhône wine region of France, which may be used throughout the region, also in those areas which are covered by other AOCs. In a limited part of the region, the Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AOC may be used, in some cases together with the name of the commune.

Côtes du Rhône are the basic AOC wines of the Rhône region, and exist as red, white and rosé wines, generally dominated by Grenache for reds and rosés, or Grenache blanc for whites.

==History==
Wines have been produced in the region since pre-Roman times, and those from the right bank were the favourite wines of kings and the papal community in Avignon at the time of the schism.
In the mid-17th century the right-bank district of Côte du Rhône had issued regulations to govern the quality of its wine and in 1737 the king ordered that casks of wine shipped from the nearby river port of Roquemaure, directly on the right bank 12 km north of Avignon on the left bank, should be branded with the letters CDR to introduce a system of protecting its origin. The rules for its &quot;Côte du Rhône&quot; thus formed the very early basis of today&#x27;s nationwide AOC system governed by the INAO. The name was changed to Côtes du Rhône when the left-bank wines were included in the appellation some hundred years later. The appellation received full recognition by a High Court decision in 1937, and the rules were revised in 1996 and 2001 to take into account new conditions of production.

Roquemaure is known as &quot;La Capitale des Amoureux&quot;, or &quot;The Capital of Lovers&quot;. In 1868 the relics of St. Valentine arrived after being purchased from Rome by Maximilian Richard, a local dignitary, as it was believed that the relics would protect the vines from phylloxera which ravaged the vineyards in 1866. The relics are kept in the 14th century collegiate church and each year the St Valentine &quot;Festival of the Kiss&quot; attracts over 20,000 people.
Reporter Pierre-Marie Doutrelant revealed that &quot;the growers of Côtes du Rhône planted mourvèdre and syrah, two low-yield grapes that give the wine finesse, strictly for the benefit of government inspectors. Then, when the inspectors left, they grafted cheap high-yield vines—grenache and carignan—back onto the vines&quot; (Prial)

==The wines==

===Côtes du Rhône===
At the generic level, the official AOC Côtes du Rhône region stretches 200 km from Vienne in the north to Avignon in the south and from the foothills of the Massif Central in the west to the fore-slopes of the Vaucluse and Luberon mountains east of the town of Orange. 171 communes in the French departments of Ardèche, Bouches du Rhône, Drôme, Gard, Loire, and Vaucluse are concerned with production from the 83,839 (2008) hectares of vineyard. The average yield is 52 hectolitres per hectare. Wines of all three colours must have a minimum alcohol content of 11%.
The average annual production of CDR of around 3.3 million hectolitres – 419 million bottles – (2005/2006), is assured by 5,292 concerns including 5,202 growers, 875 private producers, 70 co-operative wineries, and 20 merchant/producers and blenders, making it one of the largest single appellation regions in the world.

Red and rosé wines are made from Grenache noir, Syrah, Cinsault, Carignane, Counoise and Mourvèdre grape varieties. A maximum of 20% white varieties may be used in the rosés.
All reds grown south of Montélimar must contain a minimum of 40% Grenache, and may contain up to 5% white grapes. A red from anywhere in the appellation must contain a minimum of 15% Syrah and/or Mourvedre.
The whites must contain a minimum blend of 80% Clairette, Grenache blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne, Bourboulenc, and Viognier. Ugni blanc and Picpoul blanc may be used as secondary varieties.

There are two sub regions of Rhône wines:

1. Côtes du Rhône &quot;septentrional&quot; in the northern part of the region from Vienne to Valence. The vines are cultivated on very steep slopes making the harvest extremely arduous. The grapes are manually picked and have to be hauled up the hillside on trolleys, a feature which adds to the price. Syrah is the dominant red grape in this area.

2. Côtes du Rhône &quot;méridional&quot; from Montélimar to Avignon in the southern latitudes, produced by 123 communes.
The great majority of these are cultivated on the eastern side of the Rhône between the river bank near the town of Orange, and the Vaucluse-Luberon chain of mountains. The wines here are anchored by Grenache noir but typically include other grapes such as Syrah and Mourvedre. The reds range in color from deep crimson and ruby to almost purple and are generally full-bodied with rich but smooth tannins, though Lirac and others from the right bank tend to be somewhat lighter. They all go very well with game and other rich meat dishes.

The whites range from dry with a tang of citrus to fuller, rounder wines which can be consumed as an aperitif. Condrieu, a septentrional, is one of the rarest white wines in the world and is produced from 100% Viognier – a notoriously difficult grape to vinify.

Year of Production : In general, the year-to-year climate of the region remains fairly constant, although there may be rare occasions of spring frost which may damage the buds, thus reducing the overall yield. Drought may also affect the quantity of production. Sunlight levels are usually the average to be expected. The year of production on a label is therefore not necessarily a sign of any particular quality due to exceptionally favourable wine growing weather; it is more indicative of how the wine can be expected to have matured over a number of years.

Further up the scale from the Côtes du Rhône AOC the Côtes du Rhône-Villages AOC is produced by 95 authorized communes in the departments of the Ardèche, the Drôme, the Gard, and the Vaucluse.
The appellation includes 95 communes, with a total of approximately 3,000 hectares under cultivation. The average yield is approximately 38 hectolitres per hectare. The Grenache grape is required to be present at not less than 50%, with 20% Syrah and/or Mourvèdre. A maximum of 20% of other authorized varieties is permitted. The minimum required alcoholic strength is 12%.

===Côtes du Rhône Villages (named village)===

Next in the hierarchy, 18 of the Côtes du Rhône Village appellations are authorized to include their village name on the label. With approximately 6,500 hectares under cultivation, the average yield is approximately 37 hectolitres per hectare.
Current regulation includes following villages:
Cairanne,
Chusclan (red and rosé only),
Gadagne,
Laudun,
Massif d&#x27;Uchaux (red only),
Plan de Dieu (red only),
Puyméras (red only),
Roaix,
Rochegude,
Rousset-les-Vignes,
Sablet,
Saint Gervais,
Saint Maurice,
Saint-Pantaléon-les-Vignes,
Séguret,
Signargues (red only),
Valréas,
Visan.

===Crus===

At the most demanding level of distinction, a total of 17 crus are allowed to be recognized by their village name without requiring the mention of &quot;Côtes du Rhône&quot; on the label. With the unique exception of Château-Grillet, a white septentrional within the AOC Condrieu, a feature of the nomenclature of CDR wines is that at the top level they are named only after their villages, and not after &quot;châteaux&quot; as is usual for Bordeaux wines.
Tavel is a rosé only, very light and dry, which is usually drunk chilled.

==Grape varieties==
A large number of varieties are allowed in the Côtes du Rhône AOC. The allowed grape varieties, by colour of the wine, are indicated below. Main grape varieties for the respective colour are indicated by &quot;M&quot;, supplementary varieties (not designated for white wines) by &quot;S&quot;, and accessory varieties by &quot;(A)&quot;.

The rules for the proportion of main, supplementary and accessory grape varieties are the following:
* White wines: a minimum of 80% of the main grape varieties.
* Red and rosé wines:
** The main grape variety (Grenache noir) must make up at least 40% of the blend for wines from south of Montélimar.
** The supplementary grape varieties (Mourvèdre and Syrah) must together make up at least 15% of the blend, although this rule is not applied to small producers who produce their own wine from less than of vineyard area.
** The main and supplementary grape varieties must together make up at least 70% of the blend, and the accessory grape varieties are therefore restricted to a maximum of 30%.
** Marselan is not allowed to make up more than 10% of the blend.
** The total proportion of white varieties (all of them accessory) may not exceed 5% for red wines, and 20% for rosé wines.

The rules for the red wines mean that varietal (100%) Grenache noir may only be produced by small producers under the Côtes du Rhône appellation. North of Montélimar, varietal Mourvèdre and Syrah wines may be produced.

==Commercial aspects==
Not all growers produce their own wine, their grapes either being delivered to the co-operative wineries where the wine can be purchased in bottles and in bulk 5-litre and 10-litre plastic containers, or to the merchants who have facilities for vinification, bottling, and distribution on a commercial scale. Independent producers generally deliver their wine in bulk to the merchants for blending, bottling, and commercial distribution.

Some producers have a small quantity of their wine bottled for sale at the property, although the production of Côtes du Rhône in the region is so vast that there is little advantage for the private producers to do their own bottling. An exception would be the producers who, known for their higher appellations, may wish to gain extra distinction by including &quot;mis en bouteille à la propriété&quot; (bottled on the premises - often by a visiting mobile bottling and labeling plant), or &quot;mis en bouteille dans nos chais&quot; (outsourced bottling) on their labels.

Larger domaines may have their own bottling machinery particularly if, in accordance with the regulations for the AOCs, they also produce wines of the higher denominations of Côtes du Rhône Villages, Côtes du Rhône Villages (named village), crus, and speciality wines. In theory producers of any of the other higher appellations - Côtes du Rhône Villages, Côtes du Rhône Villages (named villages) and crus from the area of the AOC could label their wines Côtes du Rhône as long as it meets the AOC requirements, and occasionally, in order to avoid a glut and maintain prices, wines are declassed and sold as a lower denomination or in bulk for blending.

Cooperative wineries distribute their bottled wine to wholesale and retail outlets in the region and to a lesser extent, to a customer base of retailers in other parts of the country. Marketing and distribution on a large scale, including export, is carried out by the merchants.

Producers of Côtes du Rhône wines are members of the &quot;Syndicat des Vignerons des Côtes du Rhône&quot;, and at a higher level their interests are represented by Inter Rhône, which represents all the wine-growing and wine merchants of the Côtes du Rhône and the Rhône Valley and combines all promotional, economic and technical actions concerning AOC wines of the region.

<doc id="1126908" wikidata="Q1422135" url="?curid=1126908" title="Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AOC">
<text>Côtes-du-Rhône Villages () is a French wine &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; (AOC) produced in 95 settlements in the departments of the Ardèche, the Drôme, the Gard, and the Vaucluse in the southern Rhône wine region of France. Red, white and rosé wine are all produced within the appellation but not by all the named AOC villages, with the red wines being the predominant carrier of the distinction. The quality is superior to the generic Côtes-du-Rhône AOC, but below more specific appellations such as Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC and Vacqueyras AOC. Côtes-du-Rhône Villages is the second largest appellation in the Rhône, only surpassed in size by Côtes-du-Rhône AOC.

== History ==
Côtes-du-Rhône-Villages was established as AOC in 1966-1967 though drafts originated from as early as 1953. Five &quot;communes&quot; stood out, Cairanne, Gigondas (both now appellations in themselves), Chusclan, Laudun and Saint-Maurice-sur-Eygues. These communes or villages were allowed to put their name on the label in exchange of submitting to a number of regulations, such as a minimum alcohol level (12.5%). In 1955 Vacqueyras was accepted in the small group and two years later, Vinsobres.
The inspiration for the appellation was found in Beaujolais, which also has a village-level of wine. Since then, the appellation has expanded to almost 10,000 hectares, half of which can add the name of the village to the label. The other half can distinguish themselves from Côtes-du-Rhône by merely adding the &quot;village&quot;.

==Villages==
===Côtes du Rhône Villages===
With a total of approximately 8,721 hectares under cultivation (as of 2024) for Côtes du Rhône Villages, the average yield is approximately 34 hectoliters per hectare. Producers are required to adhere to stricter wine growing and wine making rules than those prescribed for Côtes du Rhône. In the red wines the Grenache grape must be present at not less than 50%, with 20% Syrah and/or Morvèdre. A maximum of 20% of other authorized varieties is permitted.
The rosés must contain a minimum of 50% Grenache with 20% of Syrah and/or Morvèdre and a maximum of 20% of other authorised varieties to comprise not more than 20% of white varieties. Used are Grenache, Clairette, Marsanne, Rousanne, Bouboulenc and Viognier.
The white wines are a blend of Grenache white, Clairette white, Marsanne white, Rousanne white, Bourboulenc white and Viognier. Other varieties are allowed to a maximum of 20%.
The minimum required alcoholic strength is fixed at 12% for all three colours. The current (as of 1 January 2025) full specification for the cultivation of the vines, the growing area boundaries, and the blending of the varieties is governed by the &quot;Syndicate des Vignerons des Côtes du Rhône&quot; (Syndicate of the winegrowers of the Côtes du Rhône) in Avignon.

===Côtes du Rhône Villages with named village appellations===

Under stricter requirements than for the Côtes du Rhône Villages, 22 of the communes of the Côtes du Rhône Villages appellation are authorized to add their respective village name on the label. With around 5,500 hectares under cultivation, the average yield is 33 to 37 hectoliters per hectare. The minimum required alcoholic strength is fixed at 12.5% for the reds and 12% for the whites and rosés.

Chusclan wines have been produced by both Roman legionaries and Benedictine monks and it was served at royal tables. Located to the west of the Rhône in the Gard département, the planted area covers 261 ha.in and around the villages of Chusclan, Codolet, Orsan, Saint-Etiennedes-Sorts and the town of Bagnols-sur-Cèze, and in 2023 produced 9,220 hectolitres. The Rosé wines, much in the minority since 1970 when producers turned their attention to reds, were granted named village status in 1967, and the reds were promoted in 1971.

Gadagne near Avignon, is a full bodied left bank wine and is the most southerly of the named villages and centred around the Vaucluse villages and towns of Caumont-sur-Durance, Châteauneuf-de-Gadagne, Morières-lès-Avignon, Saint-Saturnin-lès-Avignon, and Vedène. The named village appellation covers red wine made mainly from from Grenache noir, Mourvèdre, and Syrah, and was promoted in 2012. 108 planted hectares produced 3,809 hectolitres in 2023.

Laudun is one of the larger named villages, and also encompasses the communes of Saint-Victor-la-Coste and Tresques. Like Chusclan and other west bank wines, it has a has history centered around ancient vineyards established around 300-200 BC, and in 1375 wines from here were sent to the pope in Avignon. Later, in 1561, the wine was exported to Rome and when Louis XIII visited he tasted the white wine of Laudun. The famous and much sought after white wine accounts for around 30% of Laudun wines, but an average of only 6% is produced as a named village. Covering only 350 ha. in 2004, the vinyard expanded significantly over the following decade. By 2023 the cultivated area had increased to 591 hectares and produced 22,390 hectolitres.

Massif d&#x27;Uchaux is produced in Lagarde-Paréol, Mondragon, Piolenc, Sérignan-du-Comtat and Uchaux in the department of Vaucluse, close to the Rhône and just north of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Avignon. The red wine was upgraded to Côtes du Rhône Villages in 1983 and promoted to a named village in 2005. Grown on poor sandy and clay soils on calcerous limestone bedrock which together with an elevation of 100 to 280 meters, give this wine a character, unique among the village AOCs, of strawberry, raspberry, pepper, and nutmeg.

Nyons is a red wine only and is generally made from two-thirds Grenache and one-third Syrah. It is the newest (as of 2024) of all the named villages, and was granted its AOC in 2020. It is one of the highest altitudes, with vines cultivated in the villages of Nyons, Mirabel-aux-Baronnies, Piégon and Venterol in the department of Drôme between 200m and 500m above sea level. With global warming more and more winegrowers are increasingly attracted to higher ground. Nyons produces around 2,767 hl. over an area of 74 ha.(2023)

Plan de Dieu was accorded the Villages AOC for the reds in 2005 and elevated to a named village in 2011. The vast, flat vineyard on an alluvial plain that stretches across the villages of Camaret-sur-Aigues, Jonquières, Travaillan and Violès in the Vaucluse department, has the highest production of the named villages from its planted area of 1,170 ha., yielding 41,871 hectolitres in 2023. This is a very full bodied wine typical of the eastern Vaucluse wines of the appellation.

Puyméras was promoted to a named village in 2011. In 2023 the 89 ha. planted on terraces rising at altitudes from 220 to 600m produced 3,182 ha. around the villages of Mérindol-les-Oliviers and Mollans-sur-Ouvèze in the department of Drôme, and Faucon, Saint-Romain-en-Viennois et Puyméras in the Vaucluse.

Roaix is located between the crus of Rasteau and Cairanne on the eastern flank of the Ventabren mountain in the east of the Vaucluse department. Predominately red wine with similar characteristics as its grand neighbours that will keep for up to ten years, with white and rosé produced in small volumes. The steep and stony red clay terroir of 138 hectares yielded 4,272 hl. in 2023. Roaix received its recognition as a named village in 1967.

Rochegude village was allegedly established during the reign of emperor Domitian (51-96) and Jefferson is said to have presented wines from here to Washington himself! On its relatively flat or slightly sloping ground at a height of around 100 metres, the relatively small vineyard goes from rocky slopes to sand, clay, and flint lower down. The diversity enables the growers to assemble a variety of styles of the red wine and also some white and rosé, and in 2023 the 132 hectares produced 4,181 hectolitres.

Rousset-les-Vignes in the Drôme department is one of the northernmost of the 22 named villages. The steep vineyard of sandstone and pebbles is located at 400 m. altitude making it a village with a somewhat cooler climate than villages at lower altitudes. Though wine has been made here since the 15th century it is a very small vineyard with only 21 of its 60 hectars dedicated to the production of all three colours of the named village appelation, and yielding 642 hectolitres in 2023. The village was added to the named villages list in 1969.

Sablet is located at the foot of the Dentelles de Montmirail next to the cru of Gigondas AOC. The vineyard is mainly of the very sandy ground from which the village derives its name (&quot;sable&quot; - sand) and which contributes to the special character of its wines, in particular the renowned whites of which it is the largest producer of the named villages. In 2023 the cultivated 347 hectares yielded 11,493 hectolitres of which the majority is produced by the cooperative. When, in 1867, the vineyards of France were devastated by phylloxera, it was a Sabletain, Francois Leydier, who invented the grafting machine which helped enormously in saving the wine industry in this region and throughout France.
Saint-Andéol is one of the smallest named villages and was promoted in 2017. A west bank Rhône wine, it is the only named village AOC in the department of Ardèche and is produced in and around the villages of Saint-Marcel, Saint-Just, Saint-Martin d’Ardèche and Bourg-Saint-Andéol. The appellation is only for red wines which must be made from Grenache, and together with Syrah and Mourvèdre the three varieties must constitute 66% of the wine. In 2023 72 planted ha. yielded 2,550 hl.

Sainte-Cécile with the Vaucluse villages of Sainte-Cécile-les- Vignes, Sérignan-du-Comtat and Tulette, and Suze-la-Rousse, and Travaillan in the Gard, produces wines from the northern area soil which consists of silty clay with pebbles, and the southern part of the vineyard which is made up of limestone pebbles and sandy clay. A total of 364 planted hectares produced 12,583 hectolitres in 2023. The AOC for named villages was granted in 2016.

Saint-Gervais in the Gard department is a small west bank vineyard of only 79 ha. which produced 2,698 hectolitres in 2023 It became a named village in 1974 for its red and white wines. Located just to the north of the Lirac AOCcru in a niche in the valley of the Cèze river to the west of the Rhône, the soil is sandy limestone and clay. The climate is cooled slightly. However the river-facing vineyards are exposed to both heat and extreme winds. The local cooperative handles most of the wine produced by the village. As early as 1789 the marquis de Guasc made his own wine in the region and became a role model for independent producers.

Saint-Maurice is nested on the border of Nyons between the cru of Vinsobres AOC in the east and the named village of Visan in the west and shares their characteristics. The vineyard in Saint-Maurice-sur-Eygues was classed as Côtes du Rhône in 1953 and was raised to named village status in 1967. The 108 ha. of sandy, chalky soil yielded 3,854 hl. of red, rosé, and white wine in 2023.

Saint-Pantaléon-les-Vignes just 3 km south of Rousset-les-Vignes, the tiny Saint-Pantaléon-les-Vignes vineyard shares both its terroir and history. The 26 planted hectares produced a total 2665 hectolitres of red, white, and rosé in 2023. Saint-Pantaléon was elevated to the named village status in 1969. Every year a ceremony is held in the village, when the oldest and the youngest wine producer, along with the village&#x27;s administration, decide when to begin harvesting.

Séguret is one of the largest named villages and one of the oldest. The appelation makes all three colours at 90% red, 6% white, and 4% rosé of which it is the largest producer in the named villages. The mountain vineyard is located on the eastern side of the river Oèveze and completely surrounds the commune at around a height of 150 metres right up into the chalky foot slopes of the vertical peaks of the &quot;Dentelles de Montmirail&quot; and on pebbled terraces at an altitude of 250 to 350 metres. Its wine is mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedic &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (Natural History). The 468 hectares under cultivation produced 15,009 hectolitres in 2023.

Signargues - a named village appellation without a geographical village, Signargues wine is produced in the Gard department in an area covered by the villages of Domazan and Estézargues, and the towns of Rochefort-du-Gard and Saze. The red wine was elevated to a named village AOC in 2005. The large vineyard&#x27;s planted 502 hectares yielded 18,752 hectolitres in 2023.

Suze-la-Rousse located in the department of Drôme is a robust and full bodied red wine with the typical character of the eastern Rhône valley wines. Producing only red wine, the 239 hectares yielded 6,783 hectolitres in 2023. Suze-la-Rousse received its named village appellation in 2016. The Château de Suze-la-Rousse is the campus of the University of Wine, a department of the University Institute of Valence. The facility, with its laboratories and tasting rooms is unique in Europe, and offers courses in oenology, marketing, and management for the wine industry.

Vaison-la-Romaine has been producing wines in the east of the region for around two thousand years. The vinyard is spread over its associated villages of Saint-Marcellin-lès-Vaison, Villedieu, Buisson, and Saint-Roman-de-Malegarde on slopes in different directions and winds with altitudes from 160 to 380m just before the terrain gets really mountainous, thus providing the vignerons with a selection of different influences enabling blending the wines from the same varieties. Its 209 hectares produced 6,816 hectolitres in 2023. The AOC was elevated to a named village in 2016.

Valréas is an enclave of the Vaucluse departement entirely surrounded by the department of Drôme. The vinyard radiates in all directions from the village centre and covers 466 planted hectares which produced 14,392 hl. in 2023. The named village AOC was accorded in 1967.

Visan is one of the four villages in the Vaucluse enclave of the canton of Valréas entirely surrounded by the department of Drôme. Vines were exploited in the 3rd century. Red, white, and rosé wines were accorded the named village appellation in 1966. Visan is a medium-sized vinyard of 580 planted hectares of fat clay soil surrounding the village which produced 18,477 hl. in 2023.

<text>Padstow, a suburb of local government area City of Canterbury-Bankstown, is located 21 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, and is a part of the South-western Sydney region. Padstow is a mostly residential suburb bounded on the north by Bankstown and on the east by Salt Pan Creek, which is a stream feeding into the Georges River. The M5 South Western Motorway traverses the northern end of the suburb, which is also the location of a number of light industrial facilities.

==History==
Padstow was first named Padstow Park Estate after the town of Padstow in Cornwall, England. The Cornish Padstow&#x27;s name means &quot;the holy place of St Petrock&quot; (not to be confused with St Patrick, as they are spelled and pronounced differently), an important Cornish saint. The estate included the grants of Simon McGuigan (130 acres), Joseph Cunningham and Michael Conroy . Timber-getting and farming were the main activities here.
The Padstow Park post office opened in 1927 and the first school opened in January 1929. The railway station opened on 21 December 1931, which encouraged development in the area, especially after World War II. The suburb&#x27;s name was changed to Padstow in 1939.

<doc id="1126912" wikidata="Q18643473" url="?curid=1126912" title="Waterloo campaign">
<text>The Waterloo campaign (15 June – 8 July 1815) was fought between the French Army of the North and two Seventh Coalition armies, an Anglo-allied army and a Prussian army. Initially the French army had been commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte, but he left for Paris after the French defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Command then rested on Marshals Soult and Grouchy, who were in turn replaced by Marshal Davout, who took command at the request of the French Provisional Government. The Anglo-allied army was commanded by the Duke of Wellington and the Prussian army by Field Marshall Graf von Blücher.

The war between France and the Seventh Coalition came when the other European Great Powers refused to recognise Napoleon as Emperor of the French upon his return from exile on the island of Elba, and declared war on him, rather than France, as they still recognised Louis XVIII as the king of France and considered Napoleon a usurper. Rather than wait for the Coalition to invade France, Napoleon decided to attack his enemies and hope to defeat them in detail before they could launch their combined and coordinated invasion. He chose to launch his first attack against the two Coalition armies cantoned in modern-day Belgium, then part of the newly formed United Kingdom of the Netherlands, but until the year before part of the First French Empire.

Hostilities started on 15 June when the French drove in the Prussian outposts and crossed the river Sambre at Charleroi placing their forces between the cantonment areas of Wellington&#x27;s army (to the west) and Blücher&#x27;s army to the east. On 16 June the French prevailed with Marshal Ney commanding the left wing of the French army holding Wellington at the Battle of Quatre Bras and Napoleon defeating Blücher at the Battle of Ligny. On 17 June, Napoleon left Grouchy with the right wing of the French army to pursue the Prussians while he took the reserves and command of the left wing of the army to pursue Wellington towards Brussels.

On the night of 17 June the Anglo-allied army turned and prepared for battle on a gentle escarpment, about south of the village of Waterloo. The next day the Battle of Waterloo proved to be the decisive battle of the campaign. The Anglo-allied army stood fast against repeated French attacks, until with the aid of several Prussian corps that arrived at the east side of the battlefield in the early evening they managed to rout the French army. Grouchy with the right wing of the army engaged a Prussian rearguard at the simultaneous Battle of Wavre, and although he won a tactical victory his failure to prevent the Prussians marching to Waterloo meant that his actions contributed to the French defeat at Waterloo. The next day (19 June) he left Wavre and started a long retreat back to Paris.

After the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon chose not to remain with the army and attempt to rally it, but returned to Paris to try to secure political support for further action. He failed to do so, and was forced to abdicate on 22 June. Two days later, a Provisional Government took over French politics. Meanwhile, the two Coalition armies hotly pursued the French army to the gates of Paris, during which the French on occasion turned and fought some delaying actions, in which thousands of men were killed.

Initially the remnants of the French left wing and the reserves that were routed at Waterloo were commanded by Marshal Soult while Grouchy kept command of the right wing. However, on 25 June Soult was relieved of his command by the Provisional Government and was replaced by Grouchy, who in turn was placed under the command of Davout.

When the French Provisional Government realised that the French army under Marshal Davout was unable to defend Paris, they authorised delegates to accept capitulation terms which led to the Convention of St. Cloud (the surrender of Paris) which ended hostilities between France and the armies of Blücher and Wellington.

The two Coalition armies entered Paris on 7 July. The next day Louis XVIII was restored to the French throne, and a week later on 15 July Napoleon surrendered to Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland of . Napoleon was exiled to the island of Saint Helena where he died on 5 May 1821.

Under the terms of the peace treaty of November 1815, Coalition forces remained in Northern France as an army of occupation under the command of the Duke of Wellington.

==Prelude==
Napoleon returned from his exile on the island of Elba on 1 March 1815, King Louis XVIII fled Paris on 19 March, and Napoleon entered Paris the next day. Meanwhile, far from recognising him as Emperor of the French, the Great Powers of Europe (Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia) and their allies, who were assembled at the Congress of Vienna, , and with the signing of this declaration on 13 March 1815, so began the War of the Seventh Coalition. The hopes of peace that Napoleon had entertained were gone – war was now inevitable.

A further treaty (the ) was ratified on 25 March in which each of the Great European Powers agreed to pledge 150,000 men for the coming conflict. Such a number was not possible for Great Britain, as her standing army was smaller than the three of her peers. Besides, her forces were scattered around the globe, with many units still in Canada, where the War of 1812 had recently ceased. With this in mind she made up her numerical deficiencies by paying subsidies to the other Powers and to the other states of Europe that would contribute contingents.

Some time after the allies began mobilising, it was agreed that the planned invasion of France was to commence on 1 July 1815, much later than both Blücher and Wellington would have liked as both their armies were ready in June, ahead of the Austrians and Russians; the latter were still some distance away. The advantage of this later invasion date was that it allowed all the invading Coalition armies a chance to be ready at the same time. Thus they could deploy their combined numerically superior forces against Napoleon&#x27;s smaller, thinly spread forces, thus ensuring his defeat and avoiding a possible defeat within the borders of France. Yet this postponed invasion date allowed Napoleon more time to strengthen his forces and defences, which would make defeating him harder and more costly in lives, time and money.

Napoleon now had to decide whether to fight a defensive or offensive campaign. Defence would entail repeating the 1814 campaign in France but with much larger numbers of troops at his disposal. France&#x27;s chief cities, Paris and Lyon, would be fortified and two great French armies, the larger before Paris and the smaller before Lyon, would protect them; &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; would be encouraged, giving the Coalition armies their own taste of guerrilla warfare.

Napoleon chose to attack, which entailed a pre-emptive strike at his enemies before they were all fully assembled and able to co-operate. By destroying some of the major Coalition armies, Napoleon believed he would then be able to bring the governments of the Seventh Coalition to the peace table to discuss results favourable to himself, namely peace for France with himself remaining in power as its head. If peace were rejected by the allies despite any pre-emptive military success he might have achieved using the offensive military option available to him, then the war would continue and he could turn his attention to defeating the rest of the Coalition armies.

Napoleon&#x27;s decision to attack in Belgium was supported by several considerations. First, he had learned that the British and Prussian armies were widely dispersed and might be defeated in detail. The other major coalition armies of Russia and Austria would not be able to reinforce the Prussians and British. This was because the Russian army was still moving across Europe and the Austrian army was still mobilising. Also, the British troops in Belgium were largely second-line troops; most of the veterans of the Peninsular War had been sent to America to fight the War of 1812. In addition, the army of the United Netherlands was reinforcing the British. These Dutch troops were ill-equipped and inexperienced. And, politically, a French victory might trigger a pro-French revolution in French-speaking Belgium.

==Deployments==
===French forces===
During the Hundred Days both the Coalition nations and Napoleon mobilised for war. Upon resumption of the throne, Napoleon found that he was left with little by Louis XVIII. There were 56,000 soldiers of which 46,000 were ready to campaign. By the end of May the total armed forces available to Napoleon had reached 198,000 with 66,000 more in depots training but not yet ready for deployment.

Napoleon placed some corps of his armed forces at various strategic locations as armies of observations. Napoleon split his forces into three main armies; first, he placed an army in the south near the Alps. This army was to stop Austrian advances in Italy. Second, there was an army on the French/Prussian border where he hoped to defeat any Prussians attacks. Last, the L&#x27;Armee du Nord was placed on the border with the United Netherlands to defeat the British, Dutch and Prussian forces if they dared to attack. (see Military mobilisation during the Hundred Days). Lamarque led the small Army of the West into La Vendée to quell a Royalist insurrection in that region.

By the end of May Napoleon had formed &quot;L&#x27;Armée du Nord&quot; (the &quot;Army of the North&quot;) which, led by himself, would participate in the Waterloo campaign and had deployed the corps of this army as follows:
* I Corps (D&#x27;Erlon) cantoned between Lille and Valenciennes.
* II Corps (Reille) cantoned between Valenciennes and Avesnes.
* III Corps (Vandamme) cantoned around Rocroi.
* IV Corps (Gérard ) cantoned at Metz.
* VI Corps (Lobau) cantoned at Laon.
* I, II, III, and IV Reserve Cavalry Corps (Grouchy) cantoned at Guise.
* Imperial Guard (Mortier) at Paris.

Once the campaign was underway Napoleon, on the evening of 15 June, would send Marshal Ney with the left wing of the army (I and II corps) to face Wellington at Quatre Bras. During the morning of 17 June Napoleon detached the right wing (III and IV corps) under Marshal Grouchy to pursue the retreating Prussians (who retreated to Wavre), while he led the reserves (Imperial Guard, VI Corps, and I, II, III, and IV Cavalry Corps) to rejoin Ney&#x27;s detachment and pursue Wellington to Waterloo.

===Coalition forces===
In the early days of June 1815, Wellington and Blücher&#x27;s forces were disposed as follows:

Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied army of 93,000 with headquarters at Brussels were cantoned:
* I Corps (Prince of Orange), 30,200, headquarters Braine-le-Comte, disposed in the area Enghien-Genappe-Mons.
* II Corps (Lord Hill), 27,300, headquarters Ath, distributed in the area Ath-Oudenarde-Ghent.
* Reserve cavalry (Lord Uxbridge) 9,900, in the valley of the Dendre river, between Geraardsbergen and Ninove.
* The reserve (under Wellington himself) 25,500, lay around Brussels.
* The frontier in front (to the west) of Leuze to Binche was watched by Dutch light cavalry.

Blücher&#x27;s Prussian army of 116,000 men, with headquarters at Namur, was distributed as follows:
* I Corps (Graf von Zieten), 30,800, cantoned along the Sambre, headquarters Charleroi, and covering the area Fontaine-l&#x27;Évêque-Fleurus-Moustier.
* II Corps (Pirch I), 31,000, headquarters at Namur, lay in the area Namur-Hannut-Huy.
* III Corps (Thielemann), 23,900, in the bend of the river Meuse, headquarters Ciney, and disposed in the area Dinant-Huy-Ciney.
* IV Corps (Bülow), 30,300, with headquarters at Liège and cantoned around it.

The frontier in front of Binche, Charleroi and Dinant was watched by the Prussian outposts.

Thus the Coalition front extended for nearly across what is now Belgium, and the mean depth of their cantonments was . To concentrate the whole army on either flank would take six days, and on the common centre, around Charleroi, three days.

==Start of hostilities (15 June)==

Napoleon moved the 128,000 strong Army of the North up to the Belgian frontier in relative secrecy, and crossed the frontier at Thuin near Charleroi on 15 June 1815. The French drove in Coalition outposts and secured Napoleon&#x27;s favoured &quot;central position&quot; – at the junction between Wellington&#x27;s army to his north-west, and Blücher&#x27;s Prussians to his north-east. Wellington had expected Napoleon to try to envelop the Coalition armies by moving through Mons and to the west of Brussels. Wellington feared that such a move would cut his communications with the ports he relied on for supply. Napoleon encouraged this view with misinformation. Wellington did not hear of the capture of Charleroi until 15:00, because a message from Wellington&#x27;s intelligence chief, Colquhoun Grant, was delayed by General Dörnberg. Confirmation swiftly followed in another message from the Prince of Orange. Wellington ordered his army to concentrate around the divisional headquarters, but was still unsure whether the attack in Charleroi was a feint and the main assault would come through Mons. Wellington only determined Napoleon&#x27;s intentions with certainty in the evening, and his orders for his army to muster near Nivelles and Quatre Bras were sent out just before midnight.

The Prussian General Staff seem to have divined the French army&#x27;s intent rather more accurately.
The Prussians were not taken unawares. General Zieten noted the number of campfires as early as 13 June and Blücher began to concentrate his forces.

Napoleon considered the Prussians the greater threat and so moved against them first with the right wing of the Army of the North and the Reserves. Graf von Zieten&#x27;s I Corps rearguard action on 15 June held up Napoleon&#x27;s advance, giving Blücher the opportunity to concentrate his forces in the Sombreffe position, which had been selected earlier for its good defensive attributes. Napoleon placed Marshal Ney in command of the French left wing and ordered him to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras towards which Wellington was hastily gathering his dispersed army. Ney&#x27;s scouts reached Quatre Bras that evening.

==16 June==
===Quatre Bras===

Ney, advancing on 16 June, found Quatre Bras lightly held by Dutch troops of Wellington&#x27;s army. Despite outnumbering the Anglo-allies heavily throughout the day, Ney fought a cautious and desultory battle which failed to capture the crossroads. By the middle of the afternoon Wellington had taken personal command of the Anglo-allied forces at Quatre Bras. The position was reinforced steadily throughout the day as Anglo-allied troops converged on the crossroads. The battle ended in a tactical draw. The next day the Allies ceded the field at Quatre Bras to consolidate their forces on more favourable ground to the north along the road to Brussels as a prelude to the Battle of Waterloo.

===Ligny===

Napoleon, meanwhile, used the right wing of his army and the reserve to defeat the Prussians, under the command of General Blücher, at the Battle of Ligny on the same day. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French attack but the flanks held their ground. Several heavy Prussian cavalry charges proved enough to discourage French pursuit. Indeed, they would not pursue the Prussians until the morning of 18 June. D&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s I Corps wandered between both battles contributing to neither Quatre Bras nor to Ligny. Napoleon wrote to Ney warning him that allowing D&#x27;Erlon to wander so far away had crippled his attacks on Quatre Bras. However, he made no move to recall D&#x27;Erlon when he could easily have done so. The tone of his orders shows that he believed he had things well in hand at Ligny without assistance (as in fact he had).

==Interlude (17 June)==
After the fighting at Quatre Bras the two opposing commanders Ney and Wellington initially held their ground while they obtained information about what had happened at the larger Battle of Ligny.

With the defeat of the Prussians Napoleon still had the initiative, for Ney&#x27;s failure to take the Quatre Bras cross roads had actually placed the Anglo-allied army in a precarious position. Ney, reinforced by D&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s fresh corps, lay in front of Wellington, and Ney could have fastened upon the Anglo-allied army and held it in place during the early morning of 17 June, sufficiently long to allow Napoleon to close round his foe&#x27;s open left flank and deal him a deathblow.

But it did not happen because the French were desultory in the aftermath of Ligny. Napoleon wasted the morning of 17 June by taking a late breakfast and going to see the previous day&#x27;s battlefield before organising a pursuit of the two Coalition armies. He took the reserves and marched with Ney in pursuit of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied army, and he gave instructions to Marshal Grouchy to pursue the Prussians wherever they were going and harry them so that they had no time to reorganise.

After their defeat at the Battle of Ligny the Prussians successfully disengaged and withdrew to north west to Wavre where they reorganised. Leaving one corps in Wavre as a blocking rearguard, the three other corps advanced westward to attack the right flank of the French army in front of Waterloo. Both Napoleon and Grouchy assumed that the Prussians were retreating towards Namur and Liège, with a view to occupy the line of the river Meuse, and so during 17 June Grouchy sent the bulk of his cavalry ranging in that direction as far as Perwez. In his despatch to Napoleon written at 22:00 he was still thought that most of the Prussian army was retreating north-east, although by then he realised that two Prussian corps were heading north towards Wavre. In a second dispatch written four hours later he informed Napoleon that he now intended to advance either on Corbais or Wavre. The problem for the French was that by the end of 17 June, most of Grouchy&#x27;s detachment was now behind the Prussians, on the far side of the Dyle. This meant that they were incapable of preventing the Prussians moving from Wavre towards Waterloo and too far away themselves to go directly to the aid of Napoleon on 18 June should Wellington turn and fight south of Brussels.

Upon receiving the news of Blücher&#x27;s defeat, Wellington organised the retreat of the Anglo-allied army to a place he had identified a year before as the best place in front of Brussels for him to be able to employ his reverse slope tactics when fighting a major battle: Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment close to the village of Waterloo.

Aided by thunderstorms and torrential rain, Wellington&#x27;s army successfully extricated itself from Quatre Bras and passed through the defile of Genappe. The infantry marched ahead and were screened by a large cavalry rearguard. The French harried Wellington&#x27;s army, and there was a cavalry action at Genappe. However the French were unable to inflict any substantial casualties before night fell and Wellington&#x27;s men were ensconced in bivouacs on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean.

==Waterloo (18 June)==
It was at Waterloo on 18 June 1815 that the decisive battle of the campaign took place. The start of the battle was delayed for several hours as Napoleon waited until the ground had dried from the previous night&#x27;s rain. By late afternoon the French army had not succeeded in driving Wellington&#x27;s forces from the rise on which they stood. Once the Prussians arrived, attacking the French right flank in ever increasing numbers, Napoleon&#x27;s key strategy of keeping the Seventh Coalition armies divided had failed and his army was driven from the field in confusion, by a combined coalition general advance.

On the morning of 18 June 1815 Napoleon sent orders to Marshal Grouchy, commander of the right wing of the Army of the North, to harass the Prussians to stop them reforming. These orders arrived at around 06:00 and his corps began to move out at 08:00; by 12:00 the cannon from the Battle of Waterloo could be heard. Grouchy&#x27;s corps commanders, especially Gérard, advised that they should &quot;march to the sound of the guns&quot;. As this was contrary to Napoleon&#x27;s orders (&quot;you will be the sword against the Prussians&#x27; back driving them through Wavre and join me here&quot;) Grouchy decided not to take the advice. It became apparent that neither Napoleon nor Marshal Grouchy understood that the Prussian army was no longer either routed or disorganised. Any thoughts of joining Napoleon were dashed when a second order repeating the same instructions arrived around 16:00.

==Wavre (18–19 June)==

Following Napoleon&#x27;s orders Grouchy attacked the Prussian III Corps under the command of General Johann von Thielmann near the village of Wavre. Grouchy believed that he was engaging the rearguard of a still-retreating Prussian force. However, only one Corps remained; the other three Prussian Corps (I, II and the still fresh IV) had regrouped after their defeat at Ligny and were marching toward Waterloo.

The next morning the Battle of Wavre ended in a hollow French victory. Grouchy&#x27;s wing of the Army of the North withdrew in good order and other elements of the French army were able to reassemble around it. However, the army was not strong enough to resist the combined coalition forces, so it retreated toward Paris.

==Invasion of France and the occupation of Paris (18 June – 7 July)==

===First week (18 – 24 June)===

After the combined victory at Waterloo by the Anglo-allies under the command of the Duke of Wellington and the Prussians under the command of Prince Blücher, it was agreed by the two commanders, on the field of Waterloo, that the Prussian army, not having been so much crippled and exhausted by the battle, should undertake the further pursuit, and proceed by Charleroi towards Avesnes and Laon; whilst the Anglo-allied army, after remaining during the night on the field, should advance by Nivelles and Binche towards Péronne.

The 4,000 Prussian cavalry, that kept up an energetic pursuit during the night of 18 June, under the guidance of Marshal Gneisenau, helped to render the victory at Waterloo still more complete and decisive; and effectually deprived the French of every opportunity of recovering on the Belgian side of the frontier and to abandon most of their cannons.

A defeated army usually covers its retreat by a rear guard, but since France had such limited military resources, wasted away largely by Napoleon over the years, there was nothing of the kind. The rearmost of the fugitives having reached the river Sambre, at Charleroi, Marchienne-au-Pont, and Châtelet, by daybreak of 19 June 1815, indulged themselves with the hope that they might then enjoy a short rest from the fatigues which the relentless pursuit by the Prussians had entailed upon them during the night; but their fancied security was quickly disturbed by the appearance of a few Prussian cavalry, judiciously thrown forward towards the Sambre from the Advanced Guard at Gosselies. They resumed their flight, taking the direction of Beaumont and Philippeville.

From Charleroi, Napoleon proceeded to Philippeville; whence he hoped to be able to communicate more readily with Marshal Grouchy (who was commanding the detached and still intact right wing of the Army of the North). He tarried for four hours expediting orders to generals Rapp, Lecourbe, and Lamarque, to advance with their respective corps by forced marches to Paris (for their corps locations see the military mobilisation during the Hundred Days): and also to the commandants of fortresses, to defend themselves to the last extremity. He desired Marshal Soult to collect together all the troops that might arrive at this point, and conduct them to Laon; for which place he himself started with post horses, at 14:00.

The French army, under Soult, retreated on Laon in great confusion. The troops commanded by Grouchy, which had reached Dinant, retired in better order; but they were cut off from the wreck of the main army, and also from the direct road to Paris. Grouchy, therefore, was compelled to take the road to Rethel whence he proceeded to Rheims; and by forced marches he endeavoured to force a junction with Soult, and thus reach the capital before the Coalition armies.

In the meantime, Wellington proceeded rapidly into the heart of France; but as there was no enemy in the field to oppose his progress, the fortresses alone demanded his attention. On 20 June 1815 an was issued to the British army before they entered France. It placed the officers and men in his army under military order to treat the ordinary French population as if they were members of a Coalition nation. This by and large Wellington&#x27;s army did paying for food and lodgings. This was in sharp contrast to the Prussian army, whose soldiers treated the French as enemies, plundering the populace and wantonly destroying property during their advance.

From Beaumont, the Prussians advanced to Avesnes, which surrendered to them on 21 June. The French at first seemed determined to defend the place to the last extremity, and made considerable resistance; but a magazine having blown up, by which 400 men were killed, the rest of the garrison, which consisted chiefly of national-guards, and amounting to 439 men, surrendered at discretion. On capture of the town the Prussian soldiers treated it as a captured enemy town (rather than one liberated for their ally King Louis XVIII), and on entering the town, the greatest excesses were committed by the Prussian soldiery, which instead of being restrained was encouraged by their officers.

On his arrival at Malplaquet—the scene of one of the Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s victories—Wellington issued the Malplaquet proclamation to the French people on the night 21/22 June 1815, in which he referred to the order of the day addressed to his army, as containing an explanation of the principles by which his army would be guided.

Napoleon arrived in Paris, three days after Waterloo (21 June), still clinging to the hope of concerted national resistance; but the temper of the chambers and of the public generally forbade any such attempt. Napoleon and his brother Lucien Bonaparte were almost alone in believing that, by dissolving the chambers and declaring Napoleon dictator, they could save France from the armies of the powers now converging on Paris. Even Davout, minister of war, advised Napoleon that the destinies of France rested solely with the chambers. Clearly, it was time to safeguard what remained; and that could best be done under Talleyrand&#x27;s shield of legitimacy.

Napoleon himself at last recognised the truth. When Lucien pressed him to &quot;dare&quot;, he replied, &quot;Alas, I have dared only too much already&quot;. On 22 June 1815 he abdicated in favour of his son, Napoléon Francis Joseph Charles Bonaparte, well knowing that it was a formality, as his four-year-old son was in Austria.

With the abdication of Napoleon (22 June) the French Provisional Government led by Fouché appointed Marshal Davout, Napoleon&#x27;s minister of war, as General in Chief of the army, and opened peace negotiations with the two Coalition commanders.

On 24 June, Sir Charles Colville took the town of Cambrai by escalade, the governor retiring into the citadel, which he afterwards surrendered on 26 June, when it was given up to the order of Louis XVIII. Saint-Quentin was abandoned by the French, and was occupied by Blücher: and, on the evening of 24 June, the castle of Guise surrendered to the Prussian army. The Coalition armies, at least 140,000 strong, continued to advance.

===Second week (25 June – 1 July)===

On 25 June Napoleon received from Fouché, the president of the newly appointed Provisional Government (and Napoleon&#x27;s former police chief), an intimation that he must leave Paris. He retired to Malmaison, the former home of Joséphine, where she had died shortly after his first abdication.

On 27 June, Le Quesnoy surrendered to Wellington&#x27;s army. The garrison, which amounted to 2,800 men, chiefly national-guards, obtained liberty to retire to their homes.

On 26 June, Péronne was taken by the British troops. The first brigade of guards, under Major-general Maitland, took by storm the horn-work which covers the suburbs on the left of the Somme, and the place immediately surrendered, upon the garrison obtaining leave to retire to their homes.

On 28 June, the Prussians, under Blücher, were at Crépy, Senlis, and La Ferté-Milon; and, on 29 June, their advanced guards were at Saint-Denis and Gonesse. The resistance experienced by the British army at Cambrai and Péronne, detained them one day behind the Prussian army; but forced marches enabled them to overtake it in the neighbourhood of Paris.

In the meantime, Soult was displaced from the chief command of the army, which was conferred on Marshal Grouchy. The reason of this remarkable step, according to Soult, was because the Provisional Government suspected his fidelity. This was very likely the true reason; or they could scarcely at this moment have dismissed a man clearly superior to his successor, in point of abilities.

The rapid advance of the Coalition armies caused Grouchy to redouble his speed to reach Paris before them. This he effected, after considerable loss, particularly on the 28th, at the Battle of Villers-Cotterêts where he fell in with the left wing of the Prussian army, and afterwards with the division under General Bülow, which drove him across the river Marne, with the loss of six pieces of cannon and 1,500 prisoners. Grouchy fairly acknowledged, that his troops would not fight, and that numbers deserted. In fact, though the French army was daily receiving reinforcements from the towns and depots in its route, and also from the interior, the desertion from it was so great that its number was little if any thing at all augmented.

With the remainder, however, Grouchy succeeded in retreating to Paris, where he joined the wreck of the main army, the whole consisting of about 40 or 50,000 troops of the line, the wretched remains (including also all reinforcements) of 150,000 men, which fought at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. To these, however, were to be added the national-guards, a new levy called &quot;les Tirailleurs de la Garde&quot;, and the &quot;Federés&quot;. According to Bonaparte&#x27;s portfolio, found at Waterloo, these latter amounted to 14,000 men. Altogether, these forces were at least 40,000 more, if not a greater number. Paris was, therefore, still formidable, and capable of much resistance.

On 29 June the near approach of the Prussians, who had orders to seize Napoleon, dead or alive, caused him to retire westwards toward Rochefort, whence he hoped to reach the United States. The presence of blockading Royal Navy warships under Vice Admiral Henry Hotham with orders to prevent his escape forestalled this plan.

Meanwhile, Wellington continued his operations with unabating activity. As the armies approached the capital, Fouché, president of the Provisional Government, wrote to the British commander, asking him to halt the progress of war.

On 30 June Blücher made a movement which proved decisive of the fate of Paris. Blücher having taken the village of Aubervilliers, made a movement to his right, and crossing the Seine at Lesquielles-Saint-Germain, downstream of the capital, threw his whole force, (apart from a skeleton force holding the Coalition line north of the city) upon the west-south side of the city, where no preparations had been made to receive an enemy.

On 1 July Wellington&#x27;s army arrived in force and occupied the Coalition lines north of Paris. South of Paris, at the Battle of Rocquencourt a combined arms French force of commanded by General Exelmans destroyed a Prussian brigade of hussars under the command of Colonel von Sohr (who was severely wounded and taken prisoner during the skirmish), but this did not prevent the Prussians moving their whole army to the south side.

===Third week (2–7 July)===

By the morning of 2 July, Blücher had his right at Plessis-Piquet, and his left at Meudon, with his reserves at Versailles. This was a thunderbolt to the French; and it was then that their weakness and the Coalition strength was seen in the most conspicuous point of view; because, at that moment, the armies of Wellington and Blücher were separated, and all the French army, between them, yet the French could not move to prevent their junction (to shorten their lines of communications Wellington threw a bridge over the Seine at Argenteuil, crossed that river close to Paris, and opened the communication with Blücher). After the war Lazare Carnot (Napoleon&#x27;s Minister of Internal Affairs) blamed Napoleon for not fortifying Paris on the south side, and said he forewarned Napoleon of this danger.

To defend against the Prussian move, the French were obliged to move two corps over the Seine to meet Blücher. The fighting to the south of Paris on 2 July, was obstinate, but the Prussians finally surmounted all difficulties, and succeeded in establishing themselves firmly upon the heights of Meudon and in the village of Issy. The French loss, on this day, was estimated at 3,000 men.

The early next morning (3 July) at around 03:00, General Dominique Vandamme (under Davout&#x27;s command) was decisively defeated by General Graf von Zieten (under Blücher&#x27;s command) at the Battle of Issy, forcing the French to retreat into Paris. All further resistance, it was now obvious, would prove unavailing. Paris now lay at the mercy of the Coalition armies. The French high command decided that, providing terms were not too odious, they would capitulate and ask for an immediate armistice.

Delegates from both sides met at Palace of St. Cloud and the result of the delegates&#x27; deliberations was the surrender of Paris under the terms of the Convention of St. Cloud. As agreed in the convention, on 4 July, the French Army, commanded by Marshal Davoust, left Paris and proceeded on its march to the southern side of Loire. On 6 July, the Anglo-allied troops occupied the Barriers of Paris, on the right of the Seine; while the Prussians occupied those upon the left bank. On 7 July, the two Coalition armies entered the centre of Paris. The Chamber of Peers, having received from the Provisional Government a notification of the course of events, terminated its sittings; the Chamber of Representatives protested, but in vain. Their president (Lanjuinais) resigned his chair; and on the following day, the doors were closed, and the approaches guarded by Coalition troops.

==Aftermath==

On 8 July, the French King, Louis XVIII, made his public entry into Paris, amidst the acclamations of the people, and again occupied the throne.

On 10 July, the wind became favourable for Napoleon to set sail from France. But a British fleet made its appearance and made escape by sea impossible. Unable to remain in France or escape from it, Napoleon surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland of early in the morning of 15 July and was transported to England. Napoleon was exiled to the island of Saint Helena where he died as a prisoner-of-war in May 1821.

Some commandants of the French fortresses did not surrender upon the fall of the Provisional Government on 8 July 1815 and continued to hold out until forced to surrender by Commonwealth forces. The last to do so was Fort de Charlemont which capitulated on 8 September (see reduction of the French fortresses in 1815).

In November 1815 a formal Peace treaty between France and the Seventh Coalition was signed. The Treaty of Paris (1815) was not as generous to France as the Treaty of Paris (1814) had been. France lost territory, had to pay reparations, and agreed to pay for an army of occupation for not less than five years.

==Analysis==

This campaign was the subject of a major strategic-level study by the famous Prussian political-military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, &quot;Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815&quot;, Written , this study was Clausewitz&#x27;s last such work and is widely considered to be the best example of Clausewitz&#x27;s mature theories concerning such studies. It attracted the attention of Wellington&#x27;s staff, who prompted him to write his only published essay on the campaign (other than his immediate, official after-action reports (such as the &quot;&quot;), his 1842 &quot;Memorandum on the Battle of Waterloo&quot;. This exchange with Clausewitz was quite famous in Britain in the 19th century (it was heavily discussed in, for example, Chesney&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo Lectures&quot; (1868).

<text>Clairette de Die () AOC is a natural sparkling white wine from the Rhône Valley region in France. It is made from the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (75% minimum) and Clairette (25% maximum) grape varieties. It is characterized by its peach and apricot flavours and rose and honeysuckle aromas, and is usually drunk young at a maximum of two years, and served chilled at a temperature of 6°C to 8°C.

Crémant de Die from the same area and same producers is a prestige dry, natural sparkling wine of apple and green fruit flavours and fragrance and is vinified by the traditional method of a first fermentation in the vat followed by a second fermentation in the bottle. Originally produced from 100% Clairette, Aligoté and Muscat are now included. It is usually drunk as an aperitif but it can equally accompany a meal. At 7% or 8 % ABV, it contains less alcohol than most sparkling wines.

==Location, soil and history==
East of the town of Valence, the vineyards of Die in the French department of the Drôme on the border area between the northern and southern sub-regions of the Côtes du Rhône AOC area, in the Rhône wine region, at altitudes of up to 700 metres are among the highest in France. The chalky argilliferous soil has the feature of being able to retain enough of its rainwater to maintain a constant supply to the vines during the long dry summers.

Although the Die region stands isolated in an area of otherwise very little wine production between the northern and southern wine producing parts of the Rhône valley, the making of Clairette de Die can be traced back over two thousand years. In 1971, the method of production of Clairette de Die wine was officially recognised as the &quot;ancestral &quot;Dioise&quot; process&quot; in 1971. Clairette received its first distinction, the AO (&quot;appellation d&#x27;origine&quot;) in 1910, and the AOC was established in 1942.

==Local lore==
According to one vineyard that operates a private museum in Le Diois France, the process was found accidentally by a Gallic shepherd. The shepherd was using the cool waters of La Drôme river to chill a bottle of local wine. The bottle was forgotten and left in the cold water over the Winter. Upon finding it in the Spring, the wine was found to be carbonated or in French &quot;pétillant&quot;, a word that roughly means &quot;effervescent&quot; or &quot;sparkling&quot;. Subsequent to the original discovery, Gallic tribes left jars of the wine in rivers over the winter and then recovered them in the spring. The first documented description of the wine came from Roman author Pliny the Elder.

==Other wines from the Die region==
Coteaux de Die - A still (non sparkling) dry white wine produced from 100% clairette that was accorded an AOC in 1993. The low annual production is about 144 hectolitres. Characterised by green tints, it is usually drunk chilled and can accompany seafood.

Châtillon-en-Diois - A still (non sparkling) wine available in three colours that was accorded an AOC in 1975. The red and rosé are produced from gamay, pinot noir and syrah and are produced only from the vineyards around the village of the same name while the white wine is produced by thirteen communes.

<text>Christine Brooke-Rose (16 January 1923 – 21 March 2012) was a British writer and literary critic, known principally for her experimental novels.

==Life==
Christine Brooke-Rose was born in Geneva, Switzerland to an English father, Alfred Northbrook Rose, and American-Swiss mother, Evelyn (née Brooke). They separated in 1929. She was brought up mainly in Brussels with her maternal grandparents, but also studied at St Stephen&#x27;s College Broadstairs before attending Somerville College, Oxford (MA) and University College, London (PhD). 

During World War II, she joined the WAAF. Initially stationed at RAF Thornaby in Yorkshire where she wrote up flight records for Coastal Command. When the WAAF commanding officer heard she was fluent in German, she was immediately commissioned and called to London where she was interviewed by Frederick Winterbotham; she translated a piece of a technical message, floundering only on &quot;Klappenschrank&quot; (part of an army field telephone). Then aged 18, she was sent to Hut 3 at Bletchley Park, where she assessed intercepted German messages. Her autobiographical novel &quot;Remake&quot; records her life at BP. 

She completed her university degree, reading English at Somerville College, Oxford. She then worked for a time in London as a literary journalist and scholar. She was married three times: to Rodney Bax, whom she met at Bletchley Park; to the poet Jerzy Pietrkiewicz; and (briefly) to her cousin, Claude Brooke.

While serving at Bletchley Park and married to Bax, she had an affair with an American army officer Telford Taylor, who was himself married. This led to the end of her marriage with Bax, although Taylor&#x27;s marriage endured for some years thereafter. Taylor was in charge of the American liaison section at Bletchley, and was later Counsel for the prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials.

On separating from Pietrkiewicz in 1968, she moved to France, teaching at the University of Paris, Vincennes from 1968 to 1988. In 1975, while teaching linguistics and English literature at the University of Paris, she became professor of English and American literature and literary theory. In 1988, she retired and moved to the south of France, near Avignon.

== Work ==
Brooke-Rose later recalled that during her time at Bletchley Park, being exposed to &quot;that otherness&quot; helped her in her journey to become a novelist, by making her aware of the viewpoint of the &quot;Other&quot;.

She shared the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction for &quot;Such&quot; (1966).

She was also known as a translator, winning the Arts Council Translation Prize in 1969 for her translation of Alain Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s &quot;Dans le labyrinthe&quot; (&quot;In the Labyrinth&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

Her novel &quot;Remake&quot; (1996) is autobiographical:
:It is an autobiographical novel with a difference, using life material to compose a third-person fiction, transformed in an experiment whose tensions are those of memory – distorting and partial – checked by a rigorous and sceptical language which probes and finds durable forms underlying the impulses and passions of the subject. It is not a simple process of chronological remembering. Remake captures not facts but the contents of those facts, the feelings of a war-time child, the textures of her clothing, tastes and smells, her mother, an absent father, a gradual transformation into adulthood.

Stefania Cassar described Brooke-Rose&#x27;s &quot;Xorandor&quot; (1986) as one of a number of British novels from the 1980s and 90s that portrayed science and scientists in the light of ongoing cultural debates. &quot;&quot;Xorandor&quot;, &quot;Three Times Table&quot;, and &quot;D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s Principle&quot; are set in societies where powerful elements and/or influential figures attempt to reinforce and police the boundaries between science and the humanities, between reason and the imagination. All three novels insist that such attempts to carve out definite boundaries are misguided, limiting and ultimately doomed to failure... criticism of science from the perspective of the humanities can expose the limitations of the assumptions that under lie the two-cultures model and bring to light fresh ways of perceiving the literature-science relation.&quot;

<text>The Sydney Peace Prize is awarded by the Sydney Peace Foundation,
a non profit organisation associated with the University of Sydney. The prize promotes peace with justice and the practice of nonviolence. It aims to encourage public interest and discussion about issues of peace, social justice, human rights, and non-violent conflict resolution.

==Support==
The City of Sydney is a major supporter of the Sydney Peace Prize. This involves a significant financial contribution along with other in-kind support in order to foster peace with justice.

==The prize==
Over three months each year, the Sydney Peace Prize jury – comprising seven individuals who represent corporate, media, academic and community sector interests – assesses the merits of the nominees&#x27; efforts to promote peace with justice. It is awarded to an organisation or individual:

* who has made significant contributions to global peace including improvements in personal security and steps towards eradicating poverty, and other forms of structural violence
* whose role and responsibilities enable the recipient to use the prize to further the cause of peace with justice
* whose work illustrates the philosophy and principles of non-violence

==Considerations==
The jury has been prepared to make some controversial choices. Sydney Peace Foundation Founder, Emeritus Professor Stuart Rees, said, &quot;The initiators of the Sydney Peace Prize aimed to influence public interest in peace with justice, an ideal which is often perceived as controversial. The choice of a non-controversial candidate for a peace prize would be a safe option but unlikely to prompt debate or to increase understanding. Consensus usually encourages compliance, often anaesthetises and seldom informs.&quot;
