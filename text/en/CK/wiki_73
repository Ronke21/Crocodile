<text>Ann Petry (October 12, 1908 – April 28, 1997) was an American writer of novels, short stories, children&#x27;s books and journalism. Her 1946 debut novel &quot;The Street&quot; became the first novel by an African-American woman to sell more than a million copies.

In 2019, the Library of America published a volume of her work containing &quot;The Street&quot; as well as her 1953 masterpiece &quot;The Narrows&quot; and a few shorter pieces of nonfiction.

==Early life==
Ann, born Anna Houston Lane, was born in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. She was the youngest of three daughters to Peter Clark Lane and Bertha James Lane. Her parents belonged to the black minority, numbering 15 inhabitants of the small town. Her father was a pharmacist and her mother was a shop owner, chiropodist, and hairdresser. Ann was also the niece of Anna Louise James.

Ann and her sister were raised &quot;in the classic New England tradition: a study in efficiency, thrift, and utility (…) They were filled with ambitions that they might not have entertained had they lived in a city along with thousands of poor blacks stuck in demeaning jobs.&quot;
In 1925, Ann graduated from high school as the only person of Afro-American descent.

The family had none of the trappings of the middle class until Petry was well into adulthood. Before her mother became a businesswoman, she worked in a factory, and her sisters worked as maids. The Lane girls were raised sheltered from most of the disadvantages that other black people in the United States had to experience due to the color of their skin; however there were a number of incidents of racial discrimination.

As Petry wrote in &quot;My Most Humiliating Jim Crow Experience&quot;, published in &quot;Negro Digest&quot; in 1946, there was an incident where a racist decided that they did not want her on a beach. Her father wrote a letter to &quot;The Crisis&quot; in 1920 or 1921 complaining about a teacher who refused to teach his daughters and his niece. Another teacher humiliated her by making her read the part of Jupiter, the illiterate ex-slave in the Edgar Allan Poe short story &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot;.

Petry had a strong family foundation with well-traveled uncles, who had many stories to tell her when coming home; her father, who overcame racial obstacles, opened a pharmacy in the small town; and her mother and aunts set a strong example: Petry, interviewed by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1992, says about her tough female family members that &quot;it never occurred to them that there were things they couldn’t do because they were women.&quot;

==Career==
Petry&#x27;s desire to become a professional writer was raised first in high school when her English teacher read her essay to the class and commented on it with the words: &quot;I honestly believe that you could be a writer if you wanted to.&quot; The decision to become a pharmacist was her family&#x27;s. After graduating in 1929 from Old Saybrook High School, she went to college and graduated with a Ph.G. degree from the University of Connecticut College of Pharmacy in New Haven in 1931 and worked in the family business for several years, while also writing short stories.
On February 22, 1938, she married George D. Petry of New Iberia, Louisiana, and moved to New York. She worked as a journalist writing articles for newspapers including &quot;The Amsterdam News&quot; (between 1938 and 1941) and &quot;The People&#x27;s Voice&quot; (1941–44), and published short stories in &quot;The Crisis&quot;, where her first story appeared in 1943, &quot;Phylon&quot;, and other outlets. Between 1944 and 1946 she studied creative writing at Columbia University. She also worked at an after-school program at P.S. 10 in Harlem. It was during this period that she experienced and understood what the majority of the black population of the United States had to go through in their everyday life. Traversing the Harlem streets, living for the first time among large numbers of poor black people, seeing neglected children up close—Petry&#x27;s early years in New York inevitably made impressions on her and led her to put her experiences to paper. Her daughter Liz explained to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&quot; that &quot;her way of dealing with the problem was to write this book [&quot;The Street&quot;], which maybe was something that people who had grown up in Harlem couldn’t do.&quot;

Petry&#x27;s first and most popular novel, &quot;The Street&quot;, was published in 1946 and won the Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship with book sales exceeding one million copies. She was featured in a brief All-American News film segment covering her winning the award.

Back in Old Saybrook in 1947, Petry worked on &quot;Country Place&quot; (1947), &quot;The Narrows&quot; (1953), other stories, and books for children, but they never achieved the same success as her first book. She drew on her personal experiences of the hurricane in Old Saybrook in &quot;Country Place&quot;. Although the novel is set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, Petry identified the 1938 New England hurricane as the source for the storm that is at the center of her narrative.

Petry was a member of the American Negro Theater and appeared in productions including &quot;On Striver&#x27;s Row&quot;. She also lectured at University of California, Berkeley, Miami University and Suffolk University, and was Visiting Professor of English at the University of Hawaii.

She died in Old Saybrook at the age of 88 on April 28, 1997. She was outlived by her husband George, who died in 2000, and her only daughter, Liz Petry.

In November, 2018, Tayari Jones called for a revival of Petry&#x27;s acclaim, writing that Petry &quot;is the writer we have been waiting for, hers are the stories we need to fully illuminate the questions of our moment, while also offering a page-turning good time.&quot; In her home state of Connecticut, poet and activist, Jose B. Gonzalez has also led a movement to get Petry more recognition.

<doc id="1139996" wikidata="Q4076712" url="?curid=1139996" title="The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet">
<text>The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet is a fantasy novella by American writer Stephen King, first published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in 1984 and collected in King&#x27;s 1985 collection &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; as well as the 2000 collection &quot;Secret Windows&quot;. The title is in reference to the narrator&#x27;s belief that insanity is a sort of &quot;flexible bullet&quot;: it will eventually kill, but how long this process takes, and how much damage the bullet does before the victim finally dies, are impossible to predict. Since the publication of this story, King has occasionally used the term &quot;flexible bullet&quot; to describe insanity, in reference to this story.

==Plot summary==
The main character is Henry, fiction editor for the struggling &quot;Logan&#x27;s&quot; magazine. Henry receives an unsolicited short story from up-and-coming novelist Reg Thorpe, and considers the story to be very dark, but also a masterpiece. Through his correspondence with Thorpe, Henry learns of—and, due to Henry&#x27;s own alcoholism, comes to believe in—Thorpe&#x27;s various paranoid fantasies. Most notably, Henry and Thorpe believe that their typewriters serve as homes for Fornits, tiny elves who bring creativity and good luck. The story, told from Henry&#x27;s perspective as he relays it in anecdotal form at a barbecue, concerns Henry&#x27;s descent into Thorpe&#x27;s madness. Meanwhile, Henry also struggles to get Thorpe&#x27;s story published, despite the fact that &quot;Logan&#x27;s&quot; is in the process of closing its fiction department.

==Connections==
In the television mini-series &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;, a fornit&#x27;s symbol can be seen on a letter in the story &quot;Battleground&quot;.

==Major themes==
Madness is the chief theme of the novella. The narrator is asked to tell a story about a young author who is driven insane by early acclaim. After naming and debating the merits of Sylvia Plath and other novelists, the narrator reveals to the audience his own personal experiences with insanity. Henry&#x27;s drinking makes him susceptible to Thorpe&#x27;s fantasies about Fornits and &quot;They,&quot;- shadowy antagonists never described in detail persecuting Thorpe and his Fornit.

Henry confesses that he experienced a drunken hallucination where he met and communicated with his own Fornit, making Henry an unreliable narrator.

The narrator, Henry, is a recovering alcoholic. Much of the novella describes how Reg Thorpe&#x27;s delusions, although unrelated to alcoholism, mirror and amplify Henry&#x27;s own irrational and self-destructive conduct. This could be considered a case of folie à deux.

&quot;The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet&quot; shares a common theme of fear of nuclear power with Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;. While at a literary party, the protagonist of &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; delivers a drunken rant about the dangers of atomic power. This is of course similar to Thorpe and Henry&#x27;s fears of radium crystals and radiation poisoning. The novella mentions the case of the Radium Girls as an example of society&#x27;s ignorance of the dangers of nuclear power.

As the novella is the story of a story told at a house party, &quot;The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet&quot; is a frame tale.

<doc id="1140007" wikidata="Q946307" url="?curid=1140007" title="College of Bishops">
<text>College of Bishops, also known as the Ordo of Bishops, is a term used in the Catholic Church to denote the collection of those bishops who are in communion with the Pope. Under Canon Law, a college is a collection (Latin collegium) of persons united together for a common object so as to form one body. The Bishop of Rome (the Pope) is the head of the college.

== Authority of the college of bishops ==
In Catholic teaching, the college of bishops is the successor to the college of the apostles. While the individual members of the college of bishops are each directly responsible for pastoral care and governance in their own particular Church, the college as a whole has full supreme power over the entire Church:

The college exercises this supreme and full power in a solemn manner in an ecumenical council, but also through united action even when not gathered together in one place.

By present-day canon law it is for the Pope to select and promote the ways in which the bishops are to act collegially, such as in an ecumenical council, and it is for him to convoke, preside over (personally or by his delegates), transfer, suspend, or dissolve such a council, and approve its decrees. The Catholic Church teaches that the college of bishops, gathered in council or represented by the Pope, may teach some revealed truth as requiring to be held absolutely and definitively (infallibly).

== Enunciation of the teaching by the Second Vatican Council ==
The Second Vatican Council enunciated the doctrine of the collegiality of bishops as follows:
== Unique relationship ==
The relationship between the college of bishops and the individual bishops and in particular the Bishop of Rome has no secular counterpart, and its practical consequences cannot be deduced from secular models such as the various forms of governance of a state or of a corporation.

The doctrine of the collegiality of the bishops as a body was enunciated by the Second Vatican Council which &quot;desired to integrate all the elements which make up the Church, both the mystical and the institutional, the primacy and the episcopate, the people of God and the hierarchy, striking new notes and establishing new balances which would have to be worked out and theologized upon in the lived experience of the Church.&quot;

<text>A Papal Mass is the Solemn Pontifical High Mass celebrated by the Pope. It is celebrated on such occasions as a papal coronation, an &quot;ex cathedra&quot; pronouncement, the canonization of a saint, on Easter or Christmas or other major feast days.

Until the 1960s, there were numerous special ceremonials that were particular to the pope. Many have fallen out of use; some were last celebrated by Pope Pius X (reigned 1903–1914) or Pope Paul VI (reigned 1963–1978).

==Ceremonial in the past==
A papal Mass celebrated in the early 20th century, before the liturgical reforms of Popes Pius X and Paul VI, took this form:

===Assistant ministers===
In the papal Mass a cardinal-bishop acted as assistant priest; this honor fell on the most solemn occasions to the Cardinal-bishop of Ostia, the Dean of the College of Cardinals. Cardinal-deacons acted as deacon and assistant deacons. An auditor of the Sacra Rota served as subdeacon. There were also a Greek-Catholic deacon and subdeacon, vested according to the Byzantine Rite. The other offices were filled by the assistants to the pontifical throne, the members of the prelatical colleges, etc.

Those acting as deacon and subdeacon were at times referred to as apostolic deacon and apostolic subdeacon.

===Vestments===
Before the beginning of the ceremony, the pope was vested in the falda (a particular papal vestment which forms a long skirt extending beneath the hem of the alb), amice, alb, cincture, pectoral cross, stole, and a very long cope known as the &quot;mantum&quot; (or &quot;papal mantle&quot;). Finally, the papal tiara was placed on his head.

===Entrance===
The pope&#x27;s solemn entry into St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was accompanied by the Silveri Symphony, a fanfare played on the trumpets of the Noble Guard. The entrance procession was headed by the cardinals, bishops, prelates, and those who composed the pontifical capella, vested according to their rank and in their prescribed order of precedence. A thurifer and seven acolytes accompanied the crucifer, and the apostolic subdeacon carried the Gospel Book (a function now reserved to a deacon). At the end of the procession the pope was carried into the basilica on the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot; and with the two &quot;flabella&quot; borne on either side. He was accompanied by an entourage which included the Swiss Guards in their colorful uniforms and members of the Roman nobility in formal court dress. At times, a canopy was carried above his head. Two protonotaries apostolic raised the front of the falda as the pope walked to and from the sedia, and two papal chamberlains carried the train. The dean of the Rota carried the jewelled mitre (the &quot;mitra pretiosa&quot;), and finally two patriarchs or archbishops carried the book and bugia respectively.

The pope was received at the door by the cardinal-priest and the Canons of St. Peter&#x27;s. He then knelt briefly, leaning on a faldstool, to adore the Blessed Sacrament. Fittingly, this often took place at the St. Gregory&#x27;s Altar in St. Peter&#x27;s. He then went to the small throne for the chanting of Terce, during which he received the obedience of the cardinals, bishops, and abbots. While the psalms of Terce were being chanted, he read the prayers of preparation for Mass, during which his buskins and papal slippers were put on. He then sang the prayer of Terce.

After Terce, his outer vestments were removed, leaving only the falda, amice, alb, and cincture. The pope washed his hands, and put on the following vestments (in order), assisted by the deacon:
*sub-cinctorium
*pectoral cross
*fanon (lower &amp; upper piece) — a two piece vestment worn only by the pope during Solemn High Mass, with the two pieces connected only by a central buttonhole. It resembled a shoulder cape with alternating stripes of silver and gold.
*stole
*tunicle
*dalmatic
*episcopal gloves
*chasuble
*fanon (upper piece only) — The upper piece was pulled out from under the other vestments, and was worn over the chasuble and under the pallium. The lower piece remained under the other vestments.
*pallium
*mitre
*episcopal ring
(He did not use the crosier or the bugia at this point.)
He then gave the kiss of peace to the last three of the cardinal-priests.

===The Mass===
The Mass proceeded according to the order of a solemn pontifical high Mass with the following differences:

At the Confiteor, the cardinal bishop stood to the right of the pope, the cardinal deacon to the left, with the other ministers behind. The pope then put on the maniple. The Pope wore a special maniple intertwined with red and gold threads, symbolizing the unity of the Eastern and Western rites of the Catholic Church. After the first censing, the cardinal deacons kissed the pope on cheek and breast, and the Pontiff retired to the throne before the Chair of Saint Peter in the apse.

The senior deacon, who wore a mitre, sat on a faldstool before the altar and facing the throne; the apostolic subdeacon, together with the Greek ministers, sat on the steps of the altar; while the assistant bishop and the two assistant deacons remained near the throne.

The Epistle was sung first in Latin by the apostolic subdeacon and then in Greek by the Byzantine Rite subdeacon, following the ritual of the Greek Church. After the Epistle, the two subdeacons went together and kissed the feet of the pope. Likewise the Gospel was chanted first in Latin by the cardinal-deacon and then in Greek by the Eastern Rite deacon. The Latin Gospel was accompanied by seven candles, the Greek Gospel by two. After the Gospel both Gospel books were brought to the pope, who kissed both of them.

While elevating the Host and the chalice the pope turned in a half circle towards the Epistle and Gospel sides, respectively, as the &quot;Silveri Symphony&quot; was played on the trumpets of the Noble Guard (an honorary unit which was abolished in 1970). Eight prelates held torches for the elevation, but no sanctus bell was used at any time in a papal Mass.

It was customary for some of the bread and wine used at the Mass to be consumed, as a precaution against poison or invalid matter, by the sacristan and the cup-bearer in the presence of the pope, first at the offertory and again before the &quot;Pater noster&quot; in a short ceremony called the &quot;praegustatio&quot;.

===Communion===
After giving the kiss of peace to the assistant priest and assistant deacons, the Pope went to the throne, and there received Communion, standing.

The master of ceremonies placed a twelve-rayed asterisk on the paten, to cover the Host. The cardinal deacon elevated the paten to the height of his forehead so that it was seen by the people and the pope. He then placed the paten in the hands of the subdeacon, which had been covered with a richly embroidered veil known as the &quot;linteum pectorale&quot;, so that the subdeacon could bring it to the pope at the throne. The deacon then elevated the chalice in the same manner as the paten, the master of ceremonies covered the chalice with an embroidered pall, and the deacon carried it to the throne. The pope consumed the smaller portion of the Host, and communicated from the chalice through a thin golden tube called the &quot;fistula&quot;. He then divided the remainder of the Host, gave communion to the deacon and subdeacon; the deacon stood to receive communion and the subdeacon knelt. They then kissed the pope&#x27;s ring, and he gave them the kiss of peace. Only these three individuals received communion.

===Postcommunion===
After communion, the pope received the wine of the purification from another chalice and purified his fingers in a little cup. The deacon and subdeacon returned to the altar and partook of the chalice through the fistula, the subdeacon consumed the particle of the Host in the chalice, and both the deacon and the subdeacon consumed the wine and the water used in the purification of the chalice.

The pope then returned to the altar to finish the Mass. After the blessing, the assistant priest of the Mass published a plenary indulgence for all those in attendance. At the end of the &quot;Last Gospel&quot; (usually ), the pope went to the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot;, put on the tiara, and returned in procession as he had entered, with the same escorts.

==Modern day==

The full ceremonial detailed above has not been used since early in the pontificate of Pope Paul VI, who abolished many of the offices of the papal court previously required for the celebration of the papal Mass.

Soon after his coronation, Paul VI ceased using the papal tiara. He discontinued the use of many traditional features of papal dress, including the papal slippers and pontifical gloves. However, he did carry a distinctive form of papal ferula, silver in colour, which Pope John Paul II also used. Pope Benedict XVI carried a golden ferula with a central image of the Lamb of God and without a figure of Christ crucified.

On certain occasions, Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI wore the fanon while celebrating Mass. The custom of having the Gospel chanted in Greek by a Greek Catholic deacon on certain occasions is practiced on occasion, most notably during canonisations.

Latin is used for most papal Masses in Rome, but the local vernacular has been used with increasing frequency in recent decades, especially when the pope is abroad. However, in the last years of his pontificate Pope Benedict XVI always used Latin for the Eucharistic Prayer when celebrating Mass abroad. Under Pope Francis several Papal Masses in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square have used the Italian language. On Palm Sunday 2014, Latin was only used for the readings and some of the responses, while the next year&#x27;s Palm Sunday service was for the first time said entirely in Italian.

In the earlier papal Mass, only the pope, the deacon, and the subdeacon received Holy Communion. In modern papal Masses many receive, some from the pope himself.

It has become common for the pope to celebrate Mass in stadiums or sports arenas abroad, so as to accommodate a larger number of pilgrims. It is also current practice to celebrate some Masses in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square. However, much more often, papal Masses in Vatican City take place inside Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. These Masses, with participants from many lands, point to the universality of the Roman Catholic faith. The intentions of the Universal Prayer are spoken in a variety of vernacular languages, while the invocation sung in Latin. The Midnight Mass at Christmas normally takes place inside Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica and is telecast worldwide.

After the end of the Second Vatican Council, several of the particular ceremonies and vestments used in papal Masses were gradually discontinued. Pope Benedict XVI revived some of these traditions. One example was the playing of the Papal Anthem on brass instruments from the loggia of the interior of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica to announce the arrival of the Pope, followed by the chanting of &quot;Tu Es Petrus&quot; by the Sistine Chapel Choir when appropriate.

On December 31, 2020, Pope Francis missed the traditional New Year&#x27;s Eve papal mass due to sciatic pain. This traditional mass includes the Vespers and the Te Deum chant. This also prevented him from holding the traditional New Year&#x27;s Day papal mass as well.

Ubu&#x27;s mascot is Goldberg&#x27;s dog Ubu Roi, a black labrador retriever which he had in college and subsequently traveled the world with. The closing tag for Ubu Productions is a photograph of Ubu Roi with a frisbee in his mouth, taken in the Tuileries Garden close to the Louvre Museum in Paris. Along with the picture is Goldberg himself saying &quot;Sit, Ubu, sit! Good dog!&quot;, followed by a bark created by the sound engineer working on the closing tag.

<doc id="1140017" wikidata="Q5504196" url="?curid=1140017" title="Friends Reunited">
<text>Friends Reunited was a portfolio of social networking websites based upon the themes of reunion with research, dating and job-hunting. The first and eponymous website was created by a husband-and-wife team in the classic back-bedroom Internet start-up; it was the first online social network to achieve prominence in Britain, and it weathered the dotcom bust.

Each site worked on the principle of user-generated content through which registered users were able to post information about themselves which could be searched by other users. A double-blind email system allowed contact between users. Formerly, the site cost £7.50 per year to use but it was later free of charge.

The main Friends Reunited site aimed to reunite people who had in common a school, university, address, workplace, sports club or armed service; the sister site Genes Reunited enabled members to pool their family trees and identify common ancestors; the Dating and Jobs sister sites linked members with similar attributes, interests and/or locations.

Friends Reunited branding was attached to CD collections of nostalgic popular music, and television programmes broadcast on the ITV network, which owned the site until August 2009. A book of members&#x27; stories was published in 2003 by Virgin Books, and a song about (and named after) the site was released by The Hussys in 2006.

Following ITV&#x27;s sale of the site to DC Thomson&#x27;s Brightsolid subsidiary in 2009, the company relaunched Friends Reunited in March 2012 with a new emphasis on nostalgia and memories.

On 26 February 2016 the website closed down, after 16 years of operation.

==History==

===Establishment===
The website was conceived by Julie and Steve Pankhurst of Barnet, Hertfordshire and their friend Jason Porter in 1999. Julie Pankhurst&#x27;s curiosity about the current status of old school friends inspired her to develop the website, exploiting a gap in the UK market following the success of US website Classmates.com. Friends Reunited was officially launched in June 2000. By the end of the year, it had 3,000 members, and a year later this had increased to 2.5 million.

===ITV ownership===
In December 2005, Friends Reunited had over 15 million members and was bought by British TV company ITV plc for £120 million ($208 million), plus further payments of up to £55 million based on its performance up to 2009.

Friends Reunited had become popular enough that its uses went beyond the intentions of its founders. According to the Register, potential employers used entries to screen job applicants. Friends Reunited has been used by bitter partners to exact revenge on those who have abandoned them and users have been sued for comments made on Friends Reunited about other people. Friends Reunited features prominently in Ben Elton&#x27;s detective novel &quot;Past Mortem&quot; (2004). The website launched a series of television advertisements for the first time in early 2007.

In 2007, ITV Chairman Michael Grade described the site as &quot;the sweet spot&quot; of the internet and stated that &quot;Friends Reunited is one of the great undersung jewels in the crown ... one of the most important bits of ITV going forward, a massive presence, and profitable&quot; That year the site made a profit of £22 million, but its market valuation had fallen sharply from the £175 million paid by ITV in 2005, and it achieved growth in UK traffic of only 1.2%, compared to Facebook’s 2,393% and Bebo&#x27;s 173%.

In March 2008, after losing 47% of unique users in the previous 12 months, the site dropped the subscription fee required to contact members, but the decline continued.

===Brightsolid ownership===
On 4 March 2009, ITV announced that it would sell Friends Reunited as part of wider restructuring and disposal of non-core assets. In August 2009 it was announced that Friends Reunited had been sold for £25 million to Brightsolid Limited, a firm owned by Dundee-based publisher DC Thomson. Following regulatory approval, the sale was completed on 25 March 2010.
On 15 December 2011, DC Thomson estimated that Friends Reunited was worth only £5.2 million, a fifth of the price paid two years previously.

The site was relaunched in March 2012, with the focus shifting from reuniting with school friends to being a place where people collect and share memories of the past.

On 1 October 2013, under the guidance of new CEO Annelies van den Belt, Brightsolid Online Publishing was rebranded as DC Thomson Family History (which, in turn, became Findmypast), focusing on its core family history brands. As a result of this, Friends Reunited was no longer considered an integral part of the direction and was to be &quot;re-incubated elsewhere&quot; in the DC Thomson company.

On 18 January 2016, Friends Reunited revealed that it would be closing down the website after 16 years of operation.

<doc id="1140024" wikidata="Q7185804" url="?curid=1140024" title="Phillip Schofield">
<text>Phillip Bryan Schofield ( ; born 1 April 1962) is an English television presenter. He began his career as a Children&#x27;s BBC continuity announcer from 1985 to 1987, and went on to present a wide range of high-profile programmes for the BBC and ITV, including &quot;Going Live!&quot; (1987–1993), &quot;This Morning&quot; (2002–2023), &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; (2006–2014, 2018–2023)&quot;, All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot; (2008–2016), and &quot;The Cube&quot; (2009–2015, 2020–2021).

In February 2020, Schofield came out as gay and separated from his wife of 27 years. In May 2023, he admitted that before leaving his wife he had carried on an extramarital affair with a much younger male ITV co-worker and had lied about it to ITV&#x27;s management, his work colleagues, his lawyers, his agents and his friends and family. He had first met the co-worker while giving a talk at the drama school where the latter was then a 15-year-old student. Schofield later arranged a job interview for the co-worker at &quot;This Morning&quot;, where he was hired as a production assistant. Schofield stated that the affair had begun when the co-worker was 20 years old, at which point Schofield was in his mid-50s. Amid extensive media coverage, Schofield resigned from ITV, was removed as an ambassador for the Prince&#x27;s Trust, and was dropped by the talent agency that had represented him for over 35 years. Following his resignation, he gave separate interviews to the BBC and &quot;The Sun&quot;, in which he denied grooming the man.

==Early life==
Phillip Schofield was born on 1 April 1962, in Oldham, but moved to Newquay, Cornwall at the age of eighteen months. His father Brian H. Schofield (1935–2008) worked on Pargolla Road with Bilbo, a company which made the first surfboards in the UK. His mother, Pat Schofield, died in October 2024. He has a younger brother, Timothy Schofield, who in April 2023 was found guilty of sexual offences against a teenage boy. It was revealed during the trial that Timothy had told Phillip some details of the offences in September 2021; Phillip did not report this to the police but suggested that his brother seek help from a doctor.

Schofield attended Trenance Infant School and Newquay Tretherras School. His first job was working at a local ice-cream kiosk. Schofield often attended the Radio 1 Roadshow, which he described as &quot;an unforgettable event when it came to town.&quot; When he was 15, Schofield&#x27;s first foray into media was a Sunday show on Hospital Radio Plymouth. Despite moving so young, he says he is proud of his Lancashire roots (Oldham being in the county of Lancashire until 1974). After many years of writing letters to the BBC, at 17, Schofield took up the position of bookings clerk and tea boy for BBC Radio at Broadcasting House in London, where he was, at the time, the youngest employee.

==Television career==

=== 1985–1993, 2001–2006: BBC presenting ===

Aged 19, Schofield moved with his family to New Zealand, where he made his television debut as the initial presenter of the youth music programme &quot;Shazam!&quot; on 23 February 1982. He also spent two years working for the Auckland-based radio station Radio Hauraki.

In 1985, he returned to Britain, where he became the first in-vision continuity presenter for Children&#x27;s BBC (CBBC) on weekdays for two years from September 1985 in The Broom Cupboard, the former studio presentation for the BBC Children&#x27;s services, which introduced his friend and colleague Gordon the Gopher. Schofield left The Broom Cupboard in 1987, with Andy Crane succeeding him in the role. He then presented &quot;Going Live!&quot; on Saturday mornings between September 1987 and April 1993. From 1988 to 1991, he was the host of the &quot;Smash Hits Poll Winners Party&quot;, a pop-magazine awards show. In the early 1990s, Schofield moved to adult-orientated television with various programmes for ITV, such as &quot;Schofield&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Schofield&#x27;s TV Gold&quot; and &quot;Ten Ball&quot;. From 1994 to 1997, he presented &quot;Talking Telephone Numbers&quot; for five series, and in 1996 he hosted a show about remarkable coincidences called &quot;One in a Million&quot;. He co-authored the book that came out of the series.

In 1991, Schofield hosted a series named after Gordon which was shown on CBBC on BBC One and BBC Two and ran from 3 January 1991, to 28 March 1991, only lasting for a series of 13 episodes. The series was shown twice on BBC One, the first time being in January to March 1991 and again from 26 October to 21 December 1992. It continued where BBC Two left off with lunchtime repeats in Summer 1991. BBC Two have also repeated the series at lunchtimes four times from 18 June to 23 July 1991, 20 September to 6 December 1993, 9 March to 1 June 1994, and 17 January 1995, to 28 March 1995. It has not been repeated since 28 March 1995, on the BBC.

In the following decade, Schofield presented the &quot;National Lottery Winning Lines&quot; programme for BBC One between June 2001 and October 2004. Between 2002 and 2006, he co-hosted the BBC quiz show &quot;Test the Nation&quot; with Anne Robinson. In July 2006, he signed an exclusive two-year contract with ITV, reported to have been worth £5 million. The exclusive deal also meant he could no longer present &quot;Test the Nation&quot;, and he was replaced by Danny Wallace.

=== 1993–2023: ITV presenting ===
In August 2002, Schofield became a presenter on the ITV daytime show &quot;This Morning&quot;, joining John Leslie and Fern Britton on Fridays. In October of that year, Leslie stepped aside from the programme after allegations about his personal life, and Schofield replaced him as Britton&#x27;s co-host, first on a temporary and then a permanent basis. In May 2008, Schofield&#x27;s father died from a long-standing heart condition, after which Schofield took a break from presenting &quot;This Morning&quot;. John Barrowman stood in for him until his return. In 2009, Holly Willoughby replaced Britton as Schofield&#x27;s co-host. Schofield and Willoughby had a close friendship, with Schofield describing her as &quot;the sister he never had&quot;, and they presented the programme together from Monday to Thursday mornings until Schofield&#x27;s departure in May 2023 and Willougby&#x27;s departure four months later in October 2023.

During his 2005 &quot;Room 101&quot; appearance, Schofield made an attempt to place Gordon in Room 101 (i.e., consign him to the past), but in an audience vote Gordon was spared. Gordon also made a brief appearance with Schofield during a 1980s-themed edition of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; in February 2009. He also made a brief appearance on 5 February 2012, edition. Gordon appeared on &quot;This Morning&quot; on 13 September 2010, to celebrate Schofield&#x27;s 25th anniversary of first presenting CBBC. Schofield said &quot;I miss him&quot;. Starting in 2005, Schofield presented two series of &quot;Have I Been Here Before?&quot;, a daytime programme in which a celebrity attempted to use regression to get in touch with a previous life.

From 2006 to 2023, he presented &quot;The British Soap Awards&quot;. Between 2006 and 2008, he hosted the programme with Britton. During the run of the ITV reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, he co-hosted the spin-off series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here! Exclusive&quot; with Sheree Murphy. The show lasted one series. In 2006, Schofield presented two episodes of the ITV game show &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot;, before the network cancelled the show, due to poor ratings. In April 2008, he and Britton began hosting a revival of the ITV game show &quot;Mr and Mrs&quot;, renamed as &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot;. In 2010, the show took a break but returned in 2012 without Britton.

Schofield presented &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; on ITV with Willoughby from 2006 until 2011 and Christine Bleakley from 2012 until 2014. It was announced in the summer of 2013 that &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; was to come to an end following the 2014 series. Schofield returned to co-present the show with Willoughby in 2018 following ITV&#x27;s choice to bring the series back after four years away. From 2009 until 2015, he presented the primetime game show &quot;The Cube,&quot; which offered contestants the chance to win a top prize of £250,000. Schofield returned to present the show in 2020 following ITV&#x27;s choice to reboot the series after five years away, although it was later put on hiatus again in 2022. The only winner of the series was runner Mo Farah, who successfully completed the final game on an episode of a 2012 celebrity series in which British gold medallist athletes competed for charity.

Schofield hosted &quot;A Night of Heroes: The Sun Military Awards&quot; with Amanda Holden from 2009 until 2014. In 2010 and 2011, Schofield hosted the annual comedy show &quot;The Comedy Annual&quot; on ITV. From 2011 until 2015, He co-hosted the Christmas charity show &quot;Text Santa&quot; on ITV with Bleakley in 2011, 2014 and 2015 and Willoughby in 2012 and 2013. In December 2014, he undertook a live 24-hour TV marathon to raise money for &quot;Text Santa&quot;, where, as well as appearing on &quot;This Morning&quot;, he appeared on various other programmes throughout the day, including being a guest panellist on &quot;Loose Women&quot;.

In March 2014, Schofield narrated the one-off ITV2 show &quot;Educating Joey Essex&quot;. The show was commissioned for a full series which was aired throughout 2014. The show was commissioned for a seven-part second series, filming began in April 2016, and the series aired in summer 2016 with the first episode titled &quot;The Queen&#x27;s 90th Birthday&quot;. He presented two series of the primetime game show &quot;You&#x27;re Back in the Room&quot; for ITV in 2015 and 2016. In 2018, Schofield and Willoughby made a cameo appearance on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, when they interviewed Rosie Webster, Craig Tinker and Gemma Winter on &quot;This Morning&quot; after their role in a drugs bust at Underworld.

In 2016, Schofield travelled to South Africa with his wife Stephanie Lowe, as part of a series of short clips for &quot;This Morning&quot;. Following this, ITV aired three thirty-minute episodes in a primetime slot, called &quot;Schofield&#x27;s South African Adventure&quot;. Since March 2017, he has presented &quot;5 Gold Rings&quot;, a new game show format for ITV. In 2017, Schofield presented three-part factual series &quot;How To Spend It Well at Christmas with Phillip Schofield&quot; in which he tested the latest must-have festive gifts. The series concluded in 2022.

From 2011 to 2022, Schofield was involved in several television programmes about the British royal family. In April 2011 and June 2012, Schofield co-hosted ITV&#x27;s coverage of Prince William and Catherine Middleton&#x27;s wedding and the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee with Julie Etchingham, and in May 2018 they co-hosted ITV&#x27;s coverage of Prince Harry &amp; Meghan Markle&#x27;s wedding. In 2016, Schofield worked with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on the programme &quot;When Phillip Met Prince Philip: 60 Years of The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award&quot; to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the youth awards programme. Following Prince Phillip&#x27;s death in April 2021, Schofield co-hosted the ITV tribute programme &quot;Prince Philip, Fondly Remembered&quot; with Etchingham. During the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, Schofield presented two programmes celebrating the occasion; first with Willoughby on &quot;This Morning&quot; at Windsor Castle and secondly the ITV programme &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee Celebration&quot;, co-hosted by Etchingham.

==== David Cameron interview ====
Amid the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal on 8 November 2012, Schofield interviewed then prime minister David Cameron on &quot;This Morning&quot; and presented him with a list he had obtained from the internet of five people named as paedophiles in connection with the North Wales child abuse scandal. The names of several former senior Conservative politicians were visible on the list. Cameron responded by warning against a witchhunt, &quot;particularly about people who are gay&quot;. Schofield was widely criticised for his action, with broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby describing his behaviour as &quot;cretinous&quot;. ITV&#x27;s director of television, Peter Fincham, said that Schofield was &quot;wrong&quot; in confronting Cameron and the broadcaster had agreed to co-operate fully with government regulator Ofcom&#x27;s investigation into the matter. The investigation was initiated after Ofcom received 415 complaints from viewers. Schofield later apologised, blaming a misjudged camera angle. Schofield and ITV later paid £125,000 compensation to settle a libel suit from one of those falsely accused, Alistair McAlpine, Baron McAlpine of West Green.

==== Boris Johnson selfie ====
In December 2019, during the 2019 general election, Schofield and Willoughby were criticised for a &quot;giggly&quot; interview with then prime minister Boris Johnson. The co-hosts&#x27; decision to take a selfie with Johnson was also criticised, and viewers raised a &quot;lack of professionalism&quot; and &quot;clear bias&quot;. Schofield defended the stunt writing: &quot;Can I point out that if Mr Corbyn had asked for a selfie, we would have happily obliged.&quot; Viewers argued that the pair had been more critical when interviewing Jeremy Corbyn, who faced repeated calls to apologise for accusations of antisemitism in the Labour Party. Viewers noted that Islamophobia in the Conservative Party was not raised with Johnson. Ofcom received 149 complaints.

==== Energy bills &quot;spin to win&quot; controversy ====
On 5 September 2022, &quot;This Morning&quot; included a new prize of &quot;energy bills&quot; in their regular &quot;spin to win&quot; game. The prize equated to four months of payments, up to £400 each month. When a contestant failed to provide the qualifying passcode on air &quot;This Morning&quot; ended the phone call, prompting Willoughby to say, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re not going to make Joyce&#x27;s dreams come true.&quot; Schofield replied, &quot;Well it&#x27;s her fault.&quot; Schofield asked the first qualifying contestant if they were &quot;worried&quot; about energy bills and the contestant replied that &quot;it&#x27;s absolutely murder&quot; having a prepayment meter. The inclusion of bill payments was compared to &quot;Black Mirror&quot; or &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;. Coverage from Sky News asked &quot;Is Russia using Phillip Schofield for propaganda?&quot; after the game was reported on Russian state television. British politician Mary Kelly Foy tweeted:I&#x27;m disgusted that @thismorning have used people being unable to afford their energy bills as some kind of twisted gameshow. The producers need to rethink this immediately! Everyone deserves dignity, especially if they&#x27;re struggling.On 6 September 2022, Schofield referenced the controversy by saying, &quot;I wonder how much of that they can complain about online.&quot; Ofcom received 170 complaints about the segment and it prompted widespread criticism from viewers and commentators. Ofcom&#x27;s broadcasting code states that: &quot;We would strongly advise broadcasters not to present a monetary prize as a possible resolution of financial difficulty.&quot; On 7 September 2022, the prize was removed without comment from ITV.

==== Queuegate controversy ====
Amid the Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II, Schofield and Willoughby drew criticism for not joining the Queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II with the public, when filming at Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s lying-in-state in Westminster Hall on 17 September 2022. ITV said that Schofield and Willougby were escorted from the press gallery by government staff and did not file past the Queen&#x27;s coffin. Social media users contrasted this with the actions of former prime minister Theresa May and other celebrities including David Beckham, Susanna Reid and Tim Vine, all of whom queued for many hours with members of the general public. Online petitions were also organised calling for the pair to be sacked.

==== Toxic culture at &quot;This Morning&quot; ====
Schofield wrote in his memoir that in 2009, Britton accused him of meddling in the show and left because of this. Since the departure of Schofield and the revelation of his extramarital affair with a much younger male ITV co-worker, several people involved in the show have alleged a toxic culture operated. Ruth Langsford made a complaint to ITV while she worked there. Eamonn Holmes stated Schofield was &quot;a narcissist and a bully at the centre of the toxicity.&quot; Media personality and singer Kerry Katona described it as &quot;fake&quot; and her interview (as a guest) by Schofield and Willoughby &quot;belittling&quot;. Television personality and cleaner Kim Woodburn, who appeared on the show after leaving the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house, branded Schofield and Willoughby &quot;phoney&quot; and &quot;two-faced&quot; on the show. Dr Ranj Singh said in 2023 he had made an official complaint of a toxic culture and been managed out. ITV confirmed an external adviser carried out an investigation in 2021. Former Secretary of State for Culture Nadine Dorries questioned the culture and working practices of the show. Questions over safeguarding and complaint handling by ITV were raised generally and on 14 June Carolyn McCall answered to MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. &quot;Loose Women&quot; panellist Carol McGiffin said &quot;This Morning&quot; was &quot;tainted&quot; and her colleagues did not like the show or Schofield&#x27;s handover to them. A former production staff member also criticised the working culture which led to her resignation. Schofield, Alison Hammond and Dermot O&#x27;Leary all denied allegations of a toxic culture.

===Return to television===
After a 16-month break from the public eye, it was announced, on 25 September 2024, that Schofield would return on Channel 5&#x27;s reality show &quot;Cast Away&quot; which would see him left stranded on an island alone for 10 days, without a film crew and filming his experience himself. The series was set to begin on 30 September and would air over three 60-minute episodes. The first episode prompted mixed reactions. Schofield suggested it would be his last television appearance. Following the final episode of the series, aired on 3 October, Schofield addressed his &quot;haters&quot;, speaking about &quot;toxic&quot; people in his life and his brother Timothy. During the episode, Schofield bared his backside as he ran into the sea for a night-time swim, in a scene that many viewers complained about on social media.

== Other ventures ==

=== Radio ===
While working as presenter of &quot;Going Live!&quot;, Schofield was also broadcasting on BBC Radio 1 with a Sunday show of the same name. When Radio 1 started to broadcast in FM stereo in 1988, Schofield was one of the presenters chosen to help with the launch.

In February 2010, Schofield launched Radio Plymouth in Devon.

=== Theatre ===
Schofield first performed on the West End stage in 1991, taking over the role of Joseph in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; from Jason Donovan. While appearing in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, Schofield was approached to record a cover of &quot;Close Every Door&quot; to be released as a single. The single was released in December 1992 on Polydor Records and peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart.

The second musical he performed in was the title role of &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at the curtain call of the musical. In 2000, Schofield toured the UK with the show. He reprised his role as Joseph for an episode of &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; in March 2018.

=== Adverts ===
Schofield did numerous adverts for the car buying service We Buy Any Car, and was also a brand ambassador for the company. He was dropped by the company in October 2022 amid criticism for Schofield and Willougby not joining the Queue for the lying-in-state of Elizabeth II with the public, and all adverts featuring Schofield were later removed from the company&#x27;s YouTube channel without explanation, although the revelations about Schofield&#x27;s affair in May 2023 likely resulted in the decision.

=== Book ===

Schofield released his autobiography, &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot;, on 15 October 2020. The book was issued by Penguin Books and was described as &quot;his funny, uplifting, occasionally heartbreaking and always honest life story&quot;. It received positive reviews from fellow presenters including Lorraine Kelly, Michael Ball, Zoe Ball, Andrea McLean, Steve Wright and Chris Moyles, and newspapers including the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail.&quot;

=== Wine ===
Schofield collects Bordeaux wines, an interest kindled by Donovan. Asked in 1992 to introduce a compilation video for Donovan, Schofield refused to accept payment. He was sent two cases of Burgundy by Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman with a set of tasting notes; Schofield joined the Wine Society two years later.

In 2013, Schofield began writing for the Waitrose &quot;Weekend&quot; newspaper and became the face of wine in their UK stores. In 2020, Waitrose began exclusively selling a range of Phillip Schofield–branded Italian boxed wines created by the wine company When in Rome. However, Waitrose ceased selling the Schofield wines in 2022 after negative reviews. When in Rome stopped selling the wines on its own website after revelations emerged about Schofield&#x27;s affair, saying &quot;this collaboration has drawn to a natural conclusion&quot;.

==Personal life==

Schofield holds dual British and New Zealand citizenship. In March 1993, he married his partner Stephanie Lowe at Ackergill Tower, near Wick, Caithness, whom he met when he was 25 and working at Children&#x27;s BBC (CBBC), where she was a production assistant. The couple have two daughters, Molly, born in 1993, and Ruby, born in 1996. On 7 February 2020, Schofield came out as gay via a statement posted on Instagram Stories. In a follow-up interview on &quot;This Morning&quot;, he stated that &quot;with the strength and support of my wife and my daughters, I have been coming to terms with the fact that I am gay&quot;. He stated he had thought he was bisexual at the time he married Lowe. Schofield and Lowe separated, after which he moved out of the family home in Fawley, Buckinghamshire, and moved to Chiswick, London. They also owned a flat in the London Borough of Southwark, which they purchased in 2012 and sold in 2024. As of June 2023, Schofield and Lowe are still legally married and he continues to wear his wedding ring.

=== Affair controversy ===
Following months of speculation about his private life, and widespread reports of a feud with Willoughby, Schofield presented &quot;This Morning&quot; for the last time on 18 May 2023, after more than 20 years in the role. Two days later, he announced his departure from the programme with immediate effect, saying: &quot;ITV has decided the current situation can&#x27;t go on, and I want to do what I can to protect the show that I love.&quot; In the first broadcast after his exit, Hammond and O&#x27;Leary praised Schofield as &quot;one of the best live television broadcasters this country has ever had&quot;. A broadcasting executive subsequently told &quot;The Times&quot; that Willoughby had given ITV an ultimatum that either she or Schofield had to leave the programme.

In a statement to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 26 May, Schofield admitted that, before leaving his wife in 2020, he had carried on an extramarital affair with a younger male ITV co-worker. He had first met the co-worker while giving a talk at the drama school where the latter was then a 15-year-old student. Schofield later arranged a job interview for the co-worker at &quot;This Morning&quot;, where he was hired as a production assistant. Schofield stated that the affair had begun when the co-worker was 20 years old, at which point Schofield was in his mid-50s, and admitted lying about it to ITV&#x27;s management, his work colleagues, his lawyers, his agent and his friends and family. He resigned from ITV and apologised for his lies, while calling the relationship &quot;consensual&quot; and &quot;unwise but not illegal.&quot;

==== Reactions ====
ITV said it had investigated rumours of a relationship between Schofield and the co-worker in early 2020, but that both men had repeatedly denied the affair. News of Schofield&#x27;s affair and departure from ITV received extensive coverage in the British media. Elton John said that &quot;If it was a straight guy in a fling with a young woman, it wouldn&#x27;t even make the papers&quot; while Jeremy Clarkson said &quot;It seems to me he is only guilty of being what he said he was: gay.&quot; Piers Morgan also supported Schofield, saying it was time for the media to stop &quot;relentless persecution&quot; of Schofield.

Following his resignation, he gave separate interviews to BBC&#x27;s Amol Rajan and &quot;The Sun&quot; in June 2023, in which he apologised to the co-worker for bringing the &quot;greatest misery into his totally innocent life.&quot; He denied grooming the man, and said that he had lied not to protect his own career but to preserve the co-worker&#x27;s privacy. He said that the two had never been in a &quot;love affair&quot; and were still friends. He said his career was over; said he had &quot;lost everything&quot; and felt &quot;utterly broken&quot;, embarrassed and ashamed; and claimed that if not for his daughters Ruby and Molly guarding him, he would have attempted suicide. Although he acknowledged the age difference, Schofield said he believed homophobia was a factor in the media coverage, suggesting that an affair with a woman would not have created such a scandal.

Willoughby, who had previously said she was hurt that Schofield had lied to her when she asked about the rumours, returned to &quot;This Morning&quot; on 5 June for the first time since his departure. Stating that she felt &quot;shaken, troubled and let down,&quot; she said that everyone at the programme had given &quot;love and support to someone who was not telling the truth.&quot; She expressed concern for Schofield&#x27;s mental health, thanked viewers for their kindness and support, and said &quot;what unites us all now is a desire to heal.&quot;

==== Impact ====
Stating that it was &quot;deeply disappointed by the admissions of deceit&quot; made by Schofield, ITV severed ties with him, and instructed a King&#x27;s Counsel to carry out an external review of its handling of the incident. ITV confirmed that &quot;This Morning&quot; would continue without Schofield, and announced that Jane McDonald would replace him as host of &quot;The British Soap Awards&quot;. The talent agency YMU dropped Schofield after representing him for 35 years, and the Prince&#x27;s Trust announced that it would no longer feature him as an ambassador, saying it was &quot;no longer appropriate to work together.&quot; When in Rome stopped selling the Phillip Schofield brand wines on its own website after revelations emerged about Schofield&#x27;s affair, saying &quot;this collaboration has drawn to a natural conclusion&quot;.

As a result of the controversy, ITV in October 2023 began requiring all workers at the network – including staff, consultants, contractors, freelancers, apprentices, and individuals on work experience – to disclose all personal relationships with colleagues. The policy applies to co-workers in romantic or sexual relationships, but also to those who are friends or relatives, who live in the same household, or who share other close connections. Failure to comply with the policy can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment.

==== In politics ====
The widespread reports of a feud with Schofield and Willoughby were referenced by Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden in the House of Commons while deputising for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. Dowden jokingly said that Labour leader Keir Starmer and his deputy leader Angela Rayner were &quot;the Phil and Holly of British politics&quot;, alleging that Starmer and Rayner were &quot;at each other&#x27;s throats&quot; off camera.

==Honours and awards==
Schofield was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Arts (D.Arts) by the University of Plymouth in 2011 for his stage and television career.

Schofield was awarded several BAFTA awards, alongside Holly Willoughby, for hosting &quot;This Morning&quot;.

<text>Joseph A. Day (January 24, 1945 – May 27, 2024) was a Canadian politician. He was a Canadian Senator from October 4, 2001 until January 24, 2020, and was the leader of the Senate Liberal Caucus from June 15, 2016, to November 14, 2019. He became the interim leader of the Progressive Senate Group on November 14, 2019, and served for slightly less than one month in the role. On the eve of his pending retirement from the Senate, Day tweeted his farewell remarks. He mentioned that it was an honour to serve his fellow New Brunswickers and all Canadians. Furthermore, he also gave a farewell speech. He retired from the Senate on January 24, 2020, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

==Education and early career==
Day studied at College Militaire Royal Saint-Jean in 1963. He graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1968 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1963 to 1968 and held the rank of Lieutenant-colonel. He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, and served on its Board of Governors from 2004 to 2007. Day subsequently earned a Bachelor of Law degree from Queen&#x27;s University and a Masters of Law from Osgoode Hall Law School. Over the course of his legal career, Day has been recognized as a specialist in intellectual property matters by the Law Society of Upper Canada, and is a fellow of the Intellectual Property Institute of Canada.

Day entered politics in 1978, when a by-election was held in his native New Brunswick. Day returned from his practice of law in Ottawa, Ontario, to contest the by-election as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada, but was defeated in what had long been a Progressive Conservative stronghold.

He faced the same electorate three times in two years due to the rapid succession of general elections that came in May 1979 and February 1980.

In 1982, he ran for the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, but was narrowly defeated on the final ballot by Doug Young. The leadership race was very divisive, and the Liberals went down to their worst defeat in recent history in the 1982 provincial election. Day, who sought election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in a Saint John riding, was defeated in his fifth contest in five years.

Day&#x27;s wife, Georgie Day, was elected to the legislature, on her first attempt in electoral politics, in 1991, and was re-elected in 1995. While in the legislature, she served in the cabinets of premiers Frank McKenna, Ray Frenette, and Camille Thériault.

==Senate==
Day was appointed to the Senate of Canada from New Brunswick in 2001. He has been active on issues of Veterans Affairs Canada and media concentration.

On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Day, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.

Day was elected leader of the Senate Liberal Caucus on June 15, 2016.

With the Senate Liberal Caucus facing losing official parliamentary caucus status in 2020 with a third of its caucus facing mandatory retirements on their turning age 75, Day announced that the Senate Liberal Caucus had been dissolved and a new Progressive Senate Group formed in its wake, with the entire membership joining the new group, including Day, who was announced as the interim leader of the new group.

With Day&#x27;s mandatory retirement in January 2020, on December 12, 2019, Nova Scotia senator Jane Cordy tweeted that her colleagues in the Progressive Senate Group had selected her as the new leader, ostensibly effective that same date. Additionally, she subsequently announced later that day Senator Terry Mercer would be moving into the whip/caucus chair role, that Senator would become the new deputy leader, and that the interim monikers were being removed at the same time. On the eve of his pending retirement from the Senate, Day tweeted, &quot;On the eve of my retirement from the @SenateCA, I would like to share my farewell remarks. It has been an honour to serve my fellow New Brunswickers and all Canadians. Watch my speech here: [...] #SenCA #cdnpoli #nbpoli.&quot; He retired from the Senate on January 24, 2020, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

Day died on May 27, 2024. His funeral was held in Hampton.

<doc id="1140041" wikidata="Q7920452" url="?curid=1140041" title="Venturing">
<text>Venturing is a core program of Scouting America for young men and women ages 14 (or 13 and graduated the eighth grade) through 20. It is one of Scouting America&#x27;s three programs for older youth, which also include Sea Scouts and Exploring. The purpose of Venturing is to provide a positive environment where youth members, called Venturers, can lead the adventure, take on new leadership roles, and mature into responsible adults.

The Venturing program was founded by Richards Miller.

==History==
While the Venturing program is relatively new, older youth Scouting has a long history within the BSA. The program got its start in the 1930s as the &quot;Senior Scout&quot; Division for boys 15 and older.

In 1949 the Senior Scout Division became the Explorer Division. Sea Scouts became Sea Explorers, Air Scouts became Air Explorers, and Explorer Scouts simply Explorers. The Explorer program became less of an advanced outdoor program and more a broader program for young men, with the minimum age lowered to 14 years old. Explorers received a new advancement program, which lead to the Silver Award.

Explorer advancement was dropped in 1959. The Air Explorer program was dropped in 1964 and the Sea Explorer program had changes made, appealing more to older youth with career exploration becoming a bigger part of the program.

The BSA admitted young women ages 14–20 beginning in 1969. Many posts became co-ed. The focus on career exploration was increased, and, as the years progressed, Exploring focused more on career exploration posts, though outdoor and sports-oriented posts continued to thrive.

Career Awareness Explorer posts were introduced in the early 1980s. This was the fastest growing segment of Exploring and the BSA during the 1980s. These posts were realigned into the new Learning for Life subsidiary in 1991, and the posts were then designated as High School Career Awareness groups and the youth were no longer considered to be Explorers.

In 1998, the Venturing program took over the outdoor activities of the old BSA Explorer program, while career-oriented activities were transferred to the Learning for Life organization and renamed Exploring. In February 2016, Sea Scouting became a separate program division from Venturing.

==Aims and principles==

In addition to the Scout Oath and Law, Venturers also subscribe to the Venturing Motto and the ALPS Model. Prior to 2014, Venturers also had their own Venturing Oath and Code.

===Venturing Motto===
&quot;Lead the Adventure&quot;

===ALPS Model===
Adventure, Leadership, Personal Growth, Service

==Organization==
===Venturing crews===

Each crew is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group or religious institution, called the chartered organization. The chartered organization, represented by the adult Chartered Organization Representative, is responsible for providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. A chartered organization representative manages the relationship between the crew, the chartered organization, and the BSA.

Additionally, Venturing crew&#x27;s should have a crew committee. The crew committee is a group of adults, led by the Crew Committee Chair, who guide the crew program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration. The crew committee may elect to have the crew be all-male, all-female, or co-ed.

The crew itself is led by youth members who are elected to different leadership positions. Traditionally, these include president, vice president of administration, vice president of program, secretary, treasurer, quartermaster, guide, and historian. However, crews are free to add or remove positions as it benefits their crew. Additionally, crews may choose to have ad hoc or temporary positions like activity chair. The crew officers are encouraged to select a specialty for their crew, plan program for the upcoming year, train their crew&#x27;s members, recruit new Venturers, and give service to their communities.

The Crew Advisor exists to help guide and mentor youth crew officers and members as they lead their crew. Depending on the size of the crew, the Crew Advisor may choose to recruit Crew Associate Advisors.

===Venturing Officers&#x27; Association===
Above the crew level, Venturing is led by Council, Territory, and National Venturing Officers&#x27; Associations (VOAs) The purpose of the VOA is to better the Venturing program for Venturing youth and adults across the country. They strive to host Venturing program, teach Venturing trainings, provide crews with important resources, and grow Venturing membership.

The National VOA, previously known as the National Venturing Cabinet, are the youth leaders of the Venturing program. These youth are the National Venturing President, and five National Venturing Vice Presidents for administration, program, communication, territory support for western territories, and territory support for eastern territories.

Prior to the BSA&#x27;s national restructure in 2021, there were Council, Area, Regional, and National VOAs. The nation was divided into four regions: Central, Northeast, Southern, and Western. Combined, there were 27 areas – seven in the Central Region, six in the Northeast Region, nine in the Southern Region, and five in the Western Region.

Post restructuring the country was divided into 16 national service territories, each with its own VOA.

==Eligibility, advancement, and awards==

===Eligibility===
Any Venturer who has achieved the First Class rank as a Scout in a troop (or did so as a Varsity Scout in a team) may continue advancement toward Star, Life and Eagle Scout ranks, and Eagle Palms, up to his or her 18th birthday. Venturers must meet the requirements as prescribed in the official Scouts BSA Handbooks and on Scouting.org. As the Venturer meets requirements for the Star and Life ranks, a Board of Review is be conducted by the crew committee. The Eagle Board of Review follows the procedures for advancement established by the local council.

===Rank advancement===
The core Venturing program includes advancement opportunities for youth featuring four different ranks: Venturing, Discovery, Pathfinder, and Summit. These ranks must be earned in order. The Venturing Summit Rank is comparable to the rank of Eagle Scout.

*Venturing Rank – The Venturer makes a commitment to join the crew and move forward into the experience of Venturing.
*Discovery Rank – The Venturer must participate in adventures, take CPR and first aid training, complete the Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews and the Goal-Setting and Time Management, and Crew Officers&#x27; Orientation. They must also set and achieve a personal goal and participate in service activities. 
*Pathfinder Rank – The Venturer must participate in and lead adventures, take the Project Management training, and give leadership to advanced adventures. They must also serve as a leader in the crew, serve on a VOA, or serve on staff for leadership training. Additionally, they must set and achieve another personal goals, lead a crew recruitment project, and participate in service activities.
*Summit Rank – The Venturer must participate in and lead adventures, complete the Mentoring training, mentor another youth in leading an activity, serve as a leader in the crew, serve on a VOA, or serve on staff for a leadership training. They must also complete a personal reflection, create a personal code of conduct, lead an ethical controversy and conflict resolution scenario, and plan and conduct a service project similar to that required for the rank of Eagle Scout.

Before the current Venturing advancement was created, the Gold Award and the Silver Award were the highest Venturing recognition that could be obtained. They were both discontinued on December 31, 2014.

===Specialty awards===
In addition to Venturing&#x27;s core ranks, Venturers may also earn awards that demonstrate their unique skill sets.
*Ranger Award – The Ranger Award recognizes youth for high-level outdoors and high-adventure skills like first aid, conservation, and various electives. 
*Quest Award – The Quest Award recognizes youth who take control of their personal health by managing their diet and exercise. 
*TRUST Award – The TRUST Award recognizes youth who learn to trust those around them by more closely connecting themselves with their religion, culture, community, and themself.
*Supernova Award – The Supernova award recognizes youth who work alongside an adult mentor to better understand the world of STEM and take on unique STEM-related projects. 
*Shooting Sports Outstanding Achievement Award – This award recognizes youth who take their shooting skills to the next level by becoming proficient in five of the seven shooting sports sections: air pistol, air rifle, archery, muzzle-loading rifle, shotgun, pistol, or small bore rifle.

Before the current Venturing specialty awards, the Venturing Bronze awards for Arts and Hobbies, Outdoor, Sea Scouts, Sports and Religious Life were the primary specialty awards Venturers could earn. They were discontinued on December 31, 2014.

===Venturing Leadership Award===

The Venturing Leadership Award is given to recognize both Venturing adults and youth who have made exceptional contributions to Venturing and who exemplify the Scout Oath and Law. The Venturing leadership can be given out by councils, areas, regions, and the BSA National Council. Area, Regions, and the National Council may only give out 12 Venturing Leadership Awards every year. Councils do not have a limit on the number they may present. The award was not presented to adults from 2012 – 2015.

===National Noteworthy Crew Award===
The National Noteworthy Crew award is a distinction presented by the National Venturing Officers&#x27; Association every year to 3–5 Venturing crews from across the country who approach Venturing in innovative ways. The award was modeled off of Sea Scouting&#x27;s National Flagship. The award was first presented in May 2021.

==VenturingFest==

VenturingFest is a gathering for hundreds of Venturers from across the country to intermingle at The Summit Bechtel Reserve in Mount Hope, West Virginia. During their week-long VenturingFest experience, Venturers had the opportunity to rock climb, skateboard, BMX bike, participate in a variety of water sports, use the facilities shooting ranges, zip line, and attend concerts. VenturingFest has been hosted twice, once in 2016 and once in 2018. The third VenturingFest was planned for the summer of 2020, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Training==

===Youth training===
As part of its rank advancement, Venturing offers youth members the opportunity to complete the following trainings:
* Personal Safety Awareness Training (Venturing Rank)
* Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews (Discovery Rank)
* Goal Setting and Time Management (Discovery Rank)
* Crew Officers&#x27; Orientation (Discovery Rank)

*Wood Badge offered by a local council if the Venturer is 18 or older.

Upon turning 18, all youth Venturing participants are required to take the BSA&#x27;s Youth Protection Training (YPT).

===Adult training===
To help prepare adults to guide youth through their Venturing experience, Venturing offers adults access to the following Venturing-specific trainings: 
*Venturing Advisor Position-Specific Training available online.
*Crew Committee Position-Specific Training available online.
*Powder Horn offered by a local council.

Additionally, all adult Venturing volunteers are required to take the BSA&#x27;s Youth Protection Training Youth Protection Training (YPT). Re-certification is required every two years.

<doc id="1140043" wikidata="Q7582218" url="?curid=1140043" title="Squeeze mapping">
<text>In linear algebra, a squeeze mapping, also called a squeeze transformation, is a type of linear map that preserves Euclidean area of regions in the Cartesian plane, but is &quot;not&quot; a rotation or shear mapping.

For a fixed positive real number , the mapping

:formula_1

is the &quot;squeeze mapping&quot; with parameter . Since

:formula_2

is a hyperbola, if and , then and the points of the image of the squeeze mapping are on the same hyperbola as is. For this reason it is natural to think of the squeeze mapping as a hyperbolic rotation, as did Émile Borel in 1914, by analogy with &quot;circular rotations&quot;, which preserve circles.

==Logarithm and hyperbolic angle==
The squeeze mapping sets the stage for development of the concept of logarithms. The problem of finding the area bounded by a hyperbola (such as is one of quadrature. The solution, found by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa in 1647, required the natural logarithm function, a new concept. Some insight into logarithms comes through hyperbolic sectors that are permuted by squeeze mappings while preserving their area. The area of a hyperbolic sector is taken as a measure of a hyperbolic angle associated with the sector. The hyperbolic angle concept is quite independent of the ordinary circular angle, but shares a property of invariance with it: whereas circular angle is invariant under rotation, hyperbolic angle is invariant under squeeze mapping. Both circular and hyperbolic angle generate invariant measures but with respect to different transformation groups. The hyperbolic functions, which take hyperbolic angle as argument, perform the role that circular functions play with the circular angle argument.

==Group theory==

In 1688, long before abstract group theory, the squeeze mapping was described by Euclid Speidell in the terms of the day: &quot;From a Square and an infinite company of Oblongs on a Superficies, each Equal to that square, how a curve is begotten which shall have the same properties or affections of any Hyperbola inscribed within a Right Angled Cone.&quot;

If and are positive real numbers, the composition of their squeeze mappings is the squeeze mapping of their product. Therefore, the collection of squeeze mappings forms a one-parameter group isomorphic to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers. An additive view of this group arises from consideration of hyperbolic sectors and their hyperbolic angles.

From the point of view of the classical groups, the group of squeeze mappings is , the identity component of the indefinite orthogonal group of 2×2 real matrices preserving the quadratic form . This is equivalent to preserving the form via the change of basis

:formula_3

and corresponds geometrically to preserving hyperbolae. The perspective of the group of squeeze mappings as hyperbolic rotation is analogous to interpreting the group (the connected component of the definite orthogonal group) preserving quadratic form as being &quot;circular rotations&quot;.

Note that the &quot; notation corresponds to the fact that the reflections

:formula_4

are not allowed, though they preserve the form (in terms of and these are and ; the additional &quot; in the hyperbolic case (as compared with the circular case) is necessary to specify the identity component because the group has connected components, while the group has components: has components, while only has 1. The fact that the squeeze transforms preserve area and orientation corresponds to the inclusion of subgroups – in this case – of the subgroup of hyperbolic rotations in the special linear group of transforms preserving area and orientation (a volume form). In the language of Möbius transformations, the squeeze transformations are the hyperbolic elements in the classification of elements.

A geometric transformation is called conformal when it preserves angles. Hyperbolic angle is defined using area under &quot;y&quot; = 1/&quot;x&quot;. Since squeeze mappings preserve areas of transformed regions such as hyperbolic sectors, the angle measure of sectors is preserved. Thus squeeze mappings are &quot;conformal&quot; in the sense of preserving hyperbolic angle.

==Applications==
Here some applications are summarized with historic references.

===Relativistic spacetime===

Spacetime geometry is conventionally developed as follows: Select (0,0) for a &quot;here and now&quot; in a spacetime. Light radiant left and right through this central event tracks two lines in the spacetime, lines that can be used to give coordinates to events away from (0,0). Trajectories of lesser velocity track closer to the original timeline (0,&quot;t&quot;). Any such velocity can be viewed as a zero velocity under a squeeze mapping called a Lorentz boost. This insight follows from a study of split-complex number multiplications and the diagonal basis which corresponds to the pair of light lines.
Formally, a squeeze preserves the hyperbolic metric expressed in the form &quot;xy&quot;; in a different coordinate system. This application in the theory of relativity was noted in 1912 by Wilson and Lewis, by Werner Greub, and by Louis Kauffman. Furthermore, the squeeze mapping form of Lorentz transformations was used by Gustav Herglotz (1909/10) while discussing Born rigidity, and was popularized by Wolfgang Rindler in his textbook on relativity, who used it in his demonstration of their characteristic property.

The term &quot;squeeze transformation&quot; was used in this context in an article connecting the Lorentz group with Jones calculus in optics.

===Corner flow===
In fluid dynamics one of the fundamental motions of an incompressible flow involves bifurcation of a flow running up against an immovable wall.
Representing the wall by the axis &quot;y&quot; = 0 and taking the parameter &quot;r&quot; = exp(&quot;t&quot;) where &quot;t&quot; is time, then the squeeze mapping with parameter &quot;r&quot; applied to an initial fluid state produces a flow with bifurcation left and right of the axis &quot;x&quot; = 0. The same model gives fluid convergence when time is run backward. Indeed, the area of any hyperbolic sector is invariant under squeezing.

For another approach to a flow with hyperbolic streamlines, see .

In 1989 Ottino described the &quot;linear isochoric two-dimensional flow&quot; as
:formula_5
where K lies in the interval [−1, 1]. The streamlines follow the curves
:formula_6
so negative &quot;K&quot; corresponds to an ellipse and positive &quot;K&quot; to a hyperbola, with the rectangular case of the squeeze mapping corresponding to &quot;K&quot; = 1.

Stocker and Hosoi described their approach to corner flow as follows:
:we suggest an alternative formulation to account for the corner-like geometry, based on the use of hyperbolic coordinates, which allows substantial analytical progress towards determination of the flow in a Plateau border and attached liquid threads. We consider a region of flow forming an angle of &quot;π&quot;/2 and delimited on the left and bottom by symmetry planes.
Stocker and Hosoi then recall Moffatt&#x27;s consideration of &quot;flow in a corner between rigid boundaries, induced by an arbitrary disturbance at a large distance.&quot; According to Stocker and Hosoi,
:For a free fluid in a square corner, Moffatt&#x27;s (antisymmetric) stream function ... [indicates] that hyperbolic coordinates are indeed the natural choice to describe these flows.

===Bridge to transcendentals===
The area-preserving property of squeeze mapping has an application in setting the foundation of the transcendental functions natural logarithm and its inverse the exponential function:

Definition: Sector(&quot;a,b&quot;) is the hyperbolic sector obtained with central rays to (&quot;a&quot;, 1/&quot;a&quot;) and (&quot;b&quot;, 1/&quot;b&quot;).

Lemma: If &quot;bc&quot; = &quot;ad&quot;, then there is a squeeze mapping that moves the sector(&quot;a,b&quot;) to sector(&quot;c,d&quot;).

Proof: Take parameter &quot;r&quot; = &quot;c&quot;/&quot;a&quot; so that (&quot;u,v&quot;) = (&quot;rx&quot;, &quot;y&quot;/&quot;r&quot;) takes (&quot;a&quot;, 1/&quot;a&quot;) to (&quot;c&quot;, 1/&quot;c&quot;) and (&quot;b&quot;, 1/&quot;b&quot;) to (&quot;d&quot;, 1/&quot;d&quot;).

Theorem (Gregoire de Saint-Vincent 1647) If &quot;bc&quot; = &quot;ad&quot;, then the quadrature of the hyperbola &quot;xy&quot; = 1 against the asymptote has equal areas between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; compared to between &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;.

Proof: An argument adding and subtracting triangles of area , one triangle being {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}, shows the hyperbolic sector area is equal to the area along the asymptote. The theorem then follows from the lemma.

Theorem (Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa 1649) As area measured against the asymptote increases in arithmetic progression, the projections upon the asymptote increase in geometric sequence. Thus the areas form &quot;logarithms&quot; of the asymptote index.

For instance, for a standard position angle which runs from (1, 1) to (&quot;x&quot;, 1/&quot;x&quot;), one may ask &quot;When is the hyperbolic angle equal to one?&quot; The answer is the transcendental number x = e.

A squeeze with &quot;r&quot; = e moves the unit angle to one between (&quot;e&quot;, 1/&quot;e&quot;) and (&quot;ee&quot;, 1/&quot;ee&quot;) which subtends a sector also of area one. The geometric progression
: &quot;e&quot;, &quot;e&quot;2, &quot;e&quot;3, ..., &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot;, ...
corresponds to the asymptotic index achieved with each sum of areas
: 1,2,3, ..., &quot;n&quot;...
which is a proto-typical arithmetic progression &quot;A&quot; + &quot;nd&quot; where &quot;A&quot; = 0 and &quot;d&quot; = 1 .

===Lie transform===
Following Pierre Ossian Bonnet&#x27;s (1867) investigations on surfaces of constant curvatures, Sophus Lie (1879) found a way to derive new pseudospherical surfaces from a known one. Such surfaces satisfy the Sine-Gordon equation:

:formula_7

where formula_8 are asymptotic coordinates of two principal tangent curves and formula_9 their respective angle. Lie showed that if formula_10 is a solution to the Sine-Gordon equation, then the following squeeze mapping (now known as Lie transform) indicates other solutions of that equation:

:formula_11

Lie (1883) noticed its relation to two other transformations of pseudospherical surfaces: The Bäcklund transform (introduced by Albert Victor Bäcklund in 1883) can be seen as the combination of a Lie transform with a Bianchi transform (introduced by Luigi Bianchi in 1879.) Such transformations of pseudospherical surfaces were discussed in detail in the lectures on differential geometry by Gaston Darboux (1894), Luigi Bianchi (1894), or Luther Pfahler Eisenhart (1909).

It is known that the Lie transforms (or squeeze mappings) correspond to Lorentz boosts in terms of light-cone coordinates, as pointed out by Terng and Uhlenbeck (2000):

:&quot;Sophus Lie observed that the SGE [Sinus-Gordon equation] is invariant under Lorentz transformations. In asymptotic coordinates, which correspond to light cone coordinates, a Lorentz transformation is formula_12.&quot;

This can be represented as follows:

:formula_13

where &quot;k&quot; corresponds to the Doppler factor in Bondi &quot;k&quot;-calculus, &quot;η&quot; is the rapidity.

<text>A multiple-vehicle collision (colloquially known as a pileup or multi-car collision), is a road traffic collision involving many vehicles. Generally occurring on high-capacity and high-speed routes such as freeways, they are one of the deadliest forms of traffic collisions. The most disastrous pileups have involved more than a hundred vehicles.

== Terminology ==
A chain collision can be defined as &quot;an accident involving three or more vehicles in which one vehicle has only rear impact damage (i.e., the &quot;lead&quot; vehicle); one vehicle has only frontal damage; and all other vehicles have frontal and rear impact damage (these are the &quot;middle&quot; vehicles)&quot;.

== Statistics ==
=== British statistics ===

In Great Britain, statistics are available on the number of vehicles involved in crashes. 
* In 2013, there were: 42,487 single-vehicle crashes, 82,429 dual-vehicle crashes, and 13,744 crashes involving three or more vehicles (%) for a total of 138,660 reported crashes. In crashes with three or more vehicles, there were 228 motorists killed and 19 pedestrians killed.
* In 2020, there were: 25,730 single-vehicle crashes, 57,392 dual-vehicle crashes, and 8,077 crashes involving three or more vehicles (%) for a total of 91,199 reported crashes. In crashes with three or more vehicles, there were 200 motorists (% of all motorists) and 17 pedestrians (% of all pedestrians) killed.

=== American statistics ===
In America, statistics are available from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS).

* Between 2005 and 2021, there were 138 fatal crashes that involved at least ten vehicles.
* Crashes involving more than ten vehicles are over 100 times more likely to result in the deaths of at least five people compared to fatal crashes involving fewer than five vehicles.
* More fatal pile-ups occur between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. than during any other single hour. However, the most frequent time for these accidents is during the transition from late afternoon to early evening, with one-third of the pile-ups happening between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
== Causes ==
Pile-ups generally occur in low-visibility conditions as drivers on freeways are following too closely and unable to adjust to road conditions.

Chain-reaction crashes can also occur in conditions of good visibility, when black ice or other road hazards are encountered unexpectedly as drivers round a curve or crest a hill.

Multiple vehicle collisions can also occur when a third vehicle is too close to an initial collision to avoid hitting one or both of the vehicles. Due to the high traffic speeds on the road, if one car develops a problem and suddenly halts, ones behind it cannot stop in time and may hit it. Considering that these roads often have high traffic volumes, more cars are forced into braking and skidding, darting into other lanes and in front of other traffic; more vehicles become involved, creating a chain reaction effect.

Determining the cause of such collisions is difficult for investigators and it is often impossible to tell if negligence caused the crash. In spite of their frequency, little formal research has been done in the United States regarding their causes.

== Effects ==

Multiple-vehicle collisions are particularly deadly as the mass of crumpled vehicles makes escape for survivors difficult. Even if survivors are able to exit their vehicles, other cars may strike them. Individual vehicles in a multiple-vehicle collision are often hit multiple times at high speed, increasing the risk of injury to passengers who may have survived the first impact with the benefit of now-discharged protective airbags. Collisions after the initial collision may occur from the side of the vehicle, where the passenger compartment is more vulnerable.

A fire in one part of the collision can quickly spread via spilled gasoline and cover the entire crash area. Multiple-vehicle collisions can also overwhelm local emergency services making speedy rescues more difficult. If the collision takes place in a remote area, getting medical help to the scene can be difficult.

The destruction and intense heat of fires can also damage roadways, particularly by melting and burning the asphalt or spalling concrete surfaces. The structural steel of bridges and overpasses can also be weakened by the heat. A fiery pileup inside a tunnel is the most serious, as there is little means to escape the poisonous fumes and the confined heat may damage structural supports.

The large scale of these collisions can close highway routes for several days, or even longer if highway support structures are damaged.

== Avoidance ==

A NHTSA report suggests that a vehicle fit with a center high-mounted stop lamps has 23.7% less risk to be involved as a lead vehicle in a chain collision while it has 16.0% less risk to be involved as a middle vehicle in such a chain collision.

== France ==

In France, in the ASFA motorway network, the out of all vehicle crashes with injuries, single vehicle crashes make up 42% of the total, dual vehicle crashes make up 41%, and crashes involving three or more vehicles make up 17%.

== Korea ==

On Korean expressways, chain crashes represent 10.7% of crashes with injuries involving truck drivers. On Korean rural roads, chain crashes represent 0.6% of crashes with injuries involving truck drivers.

== Major pileups ==

==Motorsports==
Multiple vehicle collisions can occur in the restricted courses used in motorsports as well, most commonly after a green flag (on road courses) being waved following a warm-up lap during the start of the race. Reporters and fans apply subjective guidelines as to what threshold needs to be crossed before a simple on-track incident can be described as such. NASCAR fans, for example, talk about the &quot;Big One&quot;, where many cars can be or are involved in a wreck while running close together.

<doc id="1140051" wikidata="Q284065" url="?curid=1140051" title="City Island Bridge">
<text>The City Island Bridge is a bridge in the New York City borough of the Bronx, connecting City Island with Rodman&#x27;s Neck on the mainland. The original bridge, which carried vehicles from 1901 to 2015, was replaced by the current bridge (also called the City Island Causeway), which opened in 2017. A temporary bridge was used for the demolition and construction period between the original and new bridges.

== Old bridge ==
Since the American Revolutionary War, there have been plans to link City Island with the mainland via means of a bridge. Before the original bridge named &quot;City Island Bridge&quot; was opened, there was another, unnamed bridge connecting City Island with the rest of the Bronx. The opening date of this first bridge is unclear; some sources attest that it opened in 1873, while one letter states that it opened in 1857—a disputed date since the letter&#x27;s writer may have been referring to a past date. This first bridge, which was definitely under planning in the 1860s, was listed in an 1872 map. It was a tolled drawbridge that was built partly out of wood from the USS &quot;North Carolina&quot;. This bridge was located north of the 1899 bridge and connected to City Island at Bridge Street. When the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation took over Pelham Bay Park in 1888, it claimed responsibility for maintenance over the western end of the bridge, which was located in the park.

Construction of the next City Island Bridge, which was the first with that name, was begun in 1898 and completed in 1901. Built of stone and steel, it spanned and had a projected cost of $200,000, . The bridge had five fixed spans and a central swing section, through which ships could pass. As originally built, the bridge&#x27;s City Island end connected to City Island Avenue rather than at Bridge Street, and was located partially on landfill. The bridge was the sole entry and exit for vehicles on City Island. As such, it served both as a landmark and a gateway to City Island.

The swing section was deactivated and turned into a fixed span in 1963. In 1978–1979, a proposed renovation would have detonated explosives on the corroding piers, but the plan was altered so that the piers would get heavy refurbishment instead.

By 2002, the bridge was in bad shape, and city leaders held a meeting about the deteriorating bridge, showing images of corrosion on the supports, although the corrosion had since been fixed by that time. The bridge, which had been inspected in July 1999, had been deemed capable of carrying up to . The city leaders listed four options for the bridge&#x27;s future: one entailed renovating the existing span, while the other three were for new spans. The new span proposals included a conventional causeway-style bridge with four piers; an arch bridge with large foundations on either side of the water; and a cable-stayed bridge with a tower either high.

== Replacement ==
To replace the deteriorating bridge, the city originally intended to build a cable-stayed bridge, with a high tower, wide at the top, with a base of . Vertical clearance above high water would be . The new bridge would be located in the same footprint as the existing bridge, although it would be wider to accommodate three standard-width traffic lanes, a bicycle lane and a pedestrian walkway.

The original schedule was for the project to begin in 2007 with completion in 2010. The project was then postponed until June 2012. Due to the project postponement, during 2010 repairs were made to the existing bridge deck, piers, and west abutment. Due to a lack of funding the project was delayed once more until the city announced it would accept bids in late 2012, with Tutor Perini selected as general contractor in February 2013. In 2005 the estimated cost of the project was $50 million. In 2009 the estimate increased to $120 million due to redesigns and the addition of related projects. The final bid came in at $102.7 million.

Some residents, however, opposed the design of the cable-stayed bridge and felt that its tower would be out of character with the low-rise homes on City Island. Opponents of the bridge design filed a lawsuit against the city on November 6, 2013. A Bronx Supreme Court judge granted a temporary injunction on that date. In December 2013 the court lifted the injunction, but ruled that the city must conduct public hearings. The city&#x27;s prior consultations with the island community, which began during the early design stages, had been informal. The court&#x27;s ruling requires the city to follow its Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, which includes local Community Board hearings. On May 5, 2014, the original bridge plans were scrapped, and the de Blasio administration chose to go with a slightly cheaper and much shorter causeway-style bridge. The bridge, which was later approved, would be completed by 2017.

A temporary steel bridge was erected in 2015, but a partial collapse in September delayed the opening of the temporary bridge. On December 16, 2015, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted a road test on the temporary steel bridge by running heavy equipment including fire trucks over the bridge. The NYCDOT conducted the tests to ease residents&#x27; concerns about the integrity of the temporary structure. Two days later on December 18, the original bridge was closed, and traffic was routed to the temporary bridge. Shortly after that, the city began demolishing the original bridge, with the new bridge being constructed on the same site as the 1901 bridge. The new bridge opened on October 29, 2017.

<text>King&#x27;s Dock was a dock on the River Mersey in England and part of the Port of Liverpool. It was situated in the southern dock system, connected to Wapping Dock to the north and Queen&#x27;s Dock to the south. It consisted of two branch docks.

==History==
The dock was designed by Henry Berry and opened in 1785. Further warehouse buildings were added by John Foster Sr. The dock was closed in 1972 and the branch docks have been filled in.

==After closure==
The open space was often used as a concert venue, when a large tent and stage was erected. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra played their Summer Pops concert series here. Everton FC had proposed to build a new stadium here, but those plans fell through in 2003. On 28 July 2004, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Turnaround Tour supporting their album &quot;Turnaround&quot;.

In 2008 completed regeneration of King&#x27;s Waterfront, adjacent to the Albert Dock, became an exemplary case of successful brownfield land development. As a result of this project, leisure, residential and conference facilities have been developed including 11,000-seat capacity Echo Arena Liverpool and convention centre officially opened in January 2008 when Liverpool&#x27;s year of European Capital of Culture began, 3,600 square metre multi-purpose hall, 1,350 seat conference auditorium with associated breakout rooms, 1,600 space multi-storey car park, central public plaza, 1,800 residential housing units, and two 3-star plus hotels, along with the 4-star luxury Pullman Liverpool Hotel.

The John Lennon Peace Monument is located here.

<doc id="1140067" wikidata="Q69614" url="?curid=1140067" title="1986 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 1986 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 40th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1986 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1986 Formula One World Championship for Manufacturers, both of which commenced on 23 March and ended on 26 October after sixteen races. The Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Alain Prost, Prost was the first driver to win back-to-back Drivers&#x27; Championships since Jack Brabham in 1959 and 1960. Together with Prost, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna dominated throughout the season and formed what was dubbed as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;.

After 1986, Renault left the sport as an engine supplier due to company restructuring, only to return in . The Manufacturers&#x27; Championship was won by Williams-Honda. Honda became the first Japanese engine supplier to win a Manufacturers&#x27; Championship.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following competitors contested the 1986 Formula One World Championship.
===Team changes===

* Two factory-backed constructors left Formula One after the season: Renault (only staying one more year as an engine supplier) and Alfa Romeo. Two other teams had already folded during the season: RAM and Spirit.
* The Toleman team was bought by the Benetton Group and renamed Benetton Formula.
* Shortly before the season began, Frank Williams was involved in a road accident in France that left him in a wheelchair. Technical director and part-owner Patrick Head would be forced to run the team in all departments, in addition to his design and engineering work.

====Mid-season changes====
* When entering the sport in 1985, Haas Lola encountered delays in the development of their first car, and the specially developed Ford-Cosworth V6 turbo was not ready either. So their first chassis was adjusted to be powered by a four-cylinder Hart turbo engine and could only make its debut in September. It was not until the third race of 1986 that the team could get delivery of the Cosworth engine and switch to their second car, specifically designed around it.
* The small French constructor AGS made their debut in the Italian Grand Prix. Their track record from F2 and F3000 was not particularly promising and the team had no more than seven employees. Their first F1 car existed of as many Renault parts as was legal, bolted onto an F3000 chassis. It was powered by a well-used Motori Moderni engine and driven by Ivan Capelli, while he was still on his way to become International F3000 champion.

===Driver changes===
* After triple world champion Niki Lauda retired, champion Keke Rosberg took his place at McLaren. Nelson Piquet, two world championships under his belt, took the opportunity to leave Brabham after seven seasons, and move to Williams.
* Elio de Angelis had chosen to leave Lotus, frustrated that the team&#x27;s efforts were being focused mostly on Ayrton Senna. He was granted Piquet&#x27;s seat at Brabham. Derek Warwick was originally signed to replace the Italian, but Senna gave his preference to Johnny Dumfries, British F3 champion and European F3 runner-up in 1984.
* A lot of other driver changes happened in the lower-ranking teams.

====Mid-season changes====
* Derek Warwick was left without a drive after the deal with Lotus fell through. He ended up at Brabham in May 1986, after De Angelis died in a fiery crash during private testing at Circuit Paul Ricard.
* In warm-up to the Canadian Grand Prix, Patrick Tambay, driving for Haas Lola, suffered suspension failure and a huge accident injured both his feet. Team owner Carl Haas tried to get world champion Mario Andretti as a replacement, but he declined and recommended his son Michael. When Michael was unable to obtain a FIA Superlicence, however, Haas turned to the experienced Eddie Cheever. Tambay returned for French Grand Prix.
* After fives races of the F1 season, Marc Surer suffered a serious accident when competing in the 1986 ADAC Hessen-Rallye. Christian Danner moved to Arrows to replace him. Danner&#x27;s seat at Osella was filled by Allen Berg. It was the Canadian&#x27;s debut, after talks with Arrows, Tyrrell, RAM and Spirit had not come to fruition. When his sponsorship money ran out, he was replaced at the Italian Grand Prix by Alex Caffi, granting him a debut at his home race, but further sponsorship did mean that Berg was able to see out the season.
* At the start of the British Grand Prix, Jacques Laffite was involved in a multi-car pile-up. He broke both legs and it ended his F1 career. Philippe Alliot returned to take his seat at Ligier, after driving two seasons for RAM.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Spanish Grand Prix returned to the calendar for the first time in five years and was held at the newly built Circuito de Jerez. (In and , Formula One had tried to stage the race in Fuengirola.) The owners of the Jarama circuit tried to get the slot of the European Grand Prix, but were unsuccessful.
* The Belgian Grand Prix was moved up to May to avoid the chance of hot and dry weather, after the asphalt broke up in practice for the 1985 edition under the immense power of the cars.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. The 1986 British Grand Prix would be the last at Brands Hatch, as from , it would be permanently held at Silverstone (under FISA&#x27;s &quot;one country, one circuit&quot; rule).
* The German Grand Prix returned to the Hockenheimring after using the Nürburgring for 1985, and would be permanently held at Hockenheim (again, &quot;one country, one circuit&quot;).
* The Hungarian Grand Prix was organised for the first time. It was the first F1 race to take place behind the Iron Curtain.
* The Portuguese Grand Prix was moved back to September.
* The Mexican Grand Prix returned for the first time since . The Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City was upgraded to a new layout to improve safety. (The race was originally supposed to return in 1985 but was cancelled due to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.)

====Provisional calendar====
An early version of the calendar showed 20 races. These rounds were eventually removed:

* An attempt was made to revive the Argentine Grand Prix at the Buenos Aires Autodrome to be held on 9 March as Round 1. This was unsuccessful due to lack of sponsorship and no Argentinian driver competing in the championship.
* The Japanese Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 6 April, was cancelled as rebuilding parts of the Suzuka Circuit were too time-consuming. The race would only return the following year in a completely renovated Suzuka.
* The Dutch Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 31 August, was dropped after the owners, CENAV (&quot;Circuit Exploitatie Nederlandse Autorensport Vereniging&quot;), went out of business. It was replaced by the Hungarian Grand Prix.
* The South African Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 26 October, was dropped because of apartheid. FISA banned all events in South Africa until .
* In the provisional calendar, the Swedish Grand Prix was earmarked to return for the first time since 1978 and was scheduled for 14 September (later than the original June slot it had between 1973 and 1978), the Italian Grand Prix was to take place on 28 September, Portuguese Grand Prix was to take place on 12 October, Mexican Grand Prix on 9 November and Australian Grand Prix on 23 November as the final round. All 4 were moved ahead when the Dutch, Swedish and South African rounds fell through.

==Regulation changes==

===Background===
Back in , Renault proved that turbocharged engines were the way to success and by the half-way point in the season, all teams had followed their example. The FIA saw that the power output from turbo engines had doubled in the past six years. The 1986 F1 cars in qualifying trim proved to be the most powerful Grand Prix cars in history. Manufacturers mentioned numbers above , powering cars that weighed just giving a staggering power-to-weight ratio of 2,500 hp/ton. This power output was only seen in qualifying trim, since the specially-prepared engines, tyres and gearboxes could only hold on for two to four laps under this immense force before destroying themselves, and in race trim, with the engines limited in power to conserve them to run a 190-mile (306 km) race distance, the cars were not much slower.

So after mandating turbocharged engines for 1986, the governing body decided to re-allow naturally aspirated engines for , and at the same time started reining in the power of turbo engines, before banning them altogether for the season.

===Technical regulations===
* 1.5 litre turbocharged engines compulsory (with unlimited number of cylinders, RPM and power output).
* Fuel use during the race was limited from to . This led to fuel saving playing a major role in team strategy during the season.

===Event regulations===
* Catch-fencing was banned.
* After the accident and death Elio de Angelis in testing, a permanent team of professional firefighters, FIA medical service inspector and medevac helicopter were made mandatory at all testing and race events.

==Season report==

===Race 1: Brazil===
The first race of the season was in Brazil at the rough and abrasive Jacarepagua Riocentro Autodrome in the tropical heat of Rio de Janeiro. Lengthy test sessions there before the race weekend was often the case for the teams. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Senna, followed by the two Williams-Hondas of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell, and by Rene Arnoux and Jacques Laffite in the two Ligier-Renaults. Sixth on the grid went to Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) ahead of Rosberg, Stefan Johansson (Ferrari) and Prost, with Riccardo Patrese completing the top 10 for Brabham.

The race day was very hot and humid. At the start Mansell tried to get ahead of Senna. The Brazilian refused to give way and Mansell went off into the barriers. Piquet then went past Senna on Lap 3 and took the lead, beginning to pull away at a second a lap; Senna remained ahead of Arnoux, although the Frenchman was soon overtaken by Alboreto. Rosberg was fifth but his engine would soon fail, leaving Johansson to take over. Prost made rapid progress and by lap 16 he had worked his way ahead of Johansson, Arnoux and Alboreto and was running third. On lap 19 Piquet pitted for new tyres and on the following lap Prost overtook Senna to go into the lead. Senna pitted, and dropped down the order. Piquet now charged back and retook the lead just before Prost stopped for tires and so the order settled again with Piquet leading Senna and Prost, although the McLaren driver soon went out with an engine failure. This put Arnoux third but he was a long way back and had Laffite on his tail while Dumfries was fifth. The Scotsman then ran into trouble with an electrical problem and pitted. Senna&#x27;s tires were put on his car and then taken off again and he was sent on his way, with the electrical problem not having been fixed. Berger thus moved into fifth place. Both leaders pitted again but the order remained unchanged and Rio native Piquet duly won the race with São Paulo native Senna second, completing a Brazilian 1–2 at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Laffite got the better of Arnoux for third place, while fifth place went to Brundle, who had overtaken a troubled Berger in the closing laps.

===Race 2: Spain===
3 weeks after the Brazilian Grand Prix saw the return of the Spanish Grand Prix. There had not been a Spanish Grand Prix since the Madrid-based Jarama circuit hosted the race in 1981, but the local authorities in Jerez had built a new circuit and so the F1 trucks rolled down to southern Spain for the event. The circuit, located 1 hour south of Seville was in a desert and was located in the Costa del Sol, providing very pleasant weather for the event. The flat circuit was very modern, and had a number of long corners.

At the start, pole-sitter Senna took the lead and with Piquet second and Rosberg and Prost quickly getting ahead of Mansell. The Englishman then began to charge and he moved gradually back up to second place and on the 39th lap he overtook Senna to take the lead. Mansell then pulled out a four-second lead by Senna gradually reeled him in again, while Prost sat on his tail in his McLaren-TAG/Porsche, Piquet having gone out with engine trouble. With 10 laps to go Senna challenged for the lead but Mansell held him off. Senna was not going to be beaten and tried again at the hairpin at the back of the track. This time he made it through and Mansell had to lift off, which allowed the canny Prost to sneak into second place. Mansell decided to go for a desperate gamble. He pitted for fresh tires, emerging 20secs behind Senna with nine laps to go. Those were mighty laps as Mansell carved into Senna&#x27;s lead at a rate of four seconds a lap. But ahead of him on the road was Prost – and he was not going to give up without a fight. Mansell was able to pass Prost but he was 0.7s slower on that lap than Senna. Mansell took up the chase again and as they set off on the last lap the pair were separated by only a second and a half. At the hairpin Mansell was right with Senna but there was nothing he could do through the next few corners. It was all going to be down to the acceleration out of the last corner. The Williams-Honda was quicker but Senna got to the line first, the two cars side by side, separated by 0.014secs. It was the second closest finish in F1 history to that point, behind only the 1971 Italian Grand Prix. Prost was third with Rosberg fourth, Fabi fifth and Berger sixth.

===Race 3: San Marino (Imola, Italy)===
The San Marino Grand Prix, not held in the tiny principality of San Marino (which didn&#x27;t have a race track) but at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari in Imola, Italy; just outside of Bologna near the Ferrari headquarters. The circuit had been updated with new safety features, including the demolishing of a house for more runoff area at the fast corner near the two Rivazza corners. Senna was on pole ahead of the two Williams-Hondas of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. The McLaren of Alain Prost was ahead of Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari with Keke Rosberg (McLaren), Stefan Johansson (Ferrari) and the Ligier-Renault of Rene Arnoux next up. The top 10 was completed by the Benetton-BMWs of Gerhard Berger and Teo Fabi while Patrick Tambay was 11th in his Lola-Hart. The Imola circuit was the most demanding circuit of the year for fuel consumption, and this race was to be a real test of patience and strategy for the teams and drivers. Senna took the lead at the start with Piquet behind him but Mansell had an engine problem and dropped back behind Prost and Rosberg. On the fourth lap Prost and Rosberg both overtook Senna but then Rosberg passed his teammate to take second place. Alboreto was fourth while Senna disappeared with a wheelbearing failure. This meant that Fabi and Berger were fifth and sixth, although the Austrian soon overtook the Italian. During the pit stops Prost&#x27;s crew did a better job and he took the lead when Rosberg pitted on lap 33. Keke&#x27;s stop was slow and he rejoined second. The order then settled with Piquet having to watch his mirrors for Alboreto while he conserved fuel. Finally he had enough fuel to race again. Alboreto faded and disappeared later with a turbo problem. Piquet caught Rosberg but the McLaren seemed to be able to hold him off until Rosberg ran out of petrol. Riccardo Patrese, up to fourth in his Brabham, also stopped and this meant that Gerhard Berger found himself in third at the finish behind Prost and Piquet. Johansson was fourth with Rosberg and Patrese classified fifth and sixth.

===Race 4: Monaco===
There was a new chicane at Monaco, the track having been extended out over the harbor to create a much slower kink than had previously been the case. The only change to the entry was that Patrick Tambay had a new Ford turbo engine in the back of his Beatrice Lola for the first time. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Prost, with Mansell, and Senna behind him. Then came Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari and the improving Benetton-BMW of Gerhard Berger. The Brabham-BMW BT55 seemed to be getting better as well with Riccardo Patrese sixth ahead of Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier-Renault, Tambay, Rosberg and Martin Brundle in the Tyrrell-Renault. The biggest surprise in qualifying was Johnny Dumfries&#x27;s failure to qualify the second Lotus-Renault. Laffite had to start from the back of the grid because he was not ready when the field set off for the final parade lap. The start was incident free and the top 10 then remained unchanged for the first few laps with Prost leading Senna, Mansell, Alboreto, a fast-starting Rosberg and Berger. The Austrian fell behind Patrese on lap 10 and on lap 16 Rosberg overtook Alboreto. He followed this up by overtaking Mansell on lap 26 and the Englishman then pitted for new tires, which dropped him to fifth behind Alboreto. Patrese blew his chances by stalling during his pit stop. When the pits stops were over Prost led Rosberg and Senna. Mansell was fourth. Alboreto retired with a turbo failure and Berger went out with a hub problem. Further back there was a dramatic accident when Brundle and Tambay collided at Mirabeau, the Beatrice Lola barrel-rolling in mid-air into the barriers. Both cars were out. The order at the front did not change, however, and so Prost won from Rosberg with Senna third, Mansell fourth and the Ligiers of Arnoux and Laffite fifth and sixth.

===Death of Elio de Angelis===
In the fortnight between Monaco and Belgium, there was a test at Paul Ricard and a rear wing failure on his Brabham caused Elio de Angelis to crash. The car cartwheeled over the barriers and landed upside down. The ill-equipped marshals were unable to turn it over and a fire broke out. This was put out and de Angelis was released and, after a lengthy wait for a helicopter, he was flown to hospital in Marseille where he died of smoke inhalation. This was an incident that led to the introduction of new safety standards for F1 tests but the sport had again lost one of its leading names. The Brabham team decided to run only Riccardo Patrese for the Belgian race.

===Race 5: Belgium===
The Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps saw a big surprise in qualifying as Gerhard Berger qualified his Benetton-BMW second behind Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Williams-Honda. The powerful and aerodynamically efficient Benetton was able to show its true performance at Spa. Alain Prost was third in his McLaren ahead of World Championship leader Ayrton Senna. Nigel Mansell was fifth in his Williams-Honda with Teo Fabi (Benetton), Rene Arnoux (Ligier-Renault), Keke Rosberg (McLaren), Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) and Patrick Tambay (Lola-Ford) completing the top 10.

Piquet made a good start to take the lead to go into the lead while Berger was slow away and found was between Senna and Prost at the hairpin. Prost and Berger collided and there was chaos behind them. When the dust settled Tambay was out with a broken suspension but everyone else was still going, albeit with some damage. This meant that Piquet was clear of Senna with Mansell third, Stefan Johansson (Ferrari) fourth, Johnny Dumfries (Lotus) fifth and Jacques Laffite (Ligier) sixth. Mansell quickly overhauled Senna but on lap five he spun and was overtaken by Senna and Johansson. Dumfries spun off and so Alboreto moved to fifth having passed the Ligiers, Arnoux having overtaken Laffite. Arnoux&#x27;s race would end soon afterwards with a blown engine. Soon afterwards Piquet disappeared with another engine failure and so Senna went into the lead with Mansell closing in. The pit stops resulted in Mansell getting ahead of Senna with Alboreto third and Johansson fourth. Senna closed in on Mansell but after a battle the Briton in his better-suited Williams-Honda pulled away to win. Senna was second while the two Ferraris battled for third, Johansson eventually coming out ahead of Alboreto. Laffite was fifth with Prost salvaging one point for sixth place, driving a chassis that according to McLaren technical director John Barnard was badly bent from the accident at La Source and had to be written off after the race.

===Race 6: Canada===
Before the Canadian Grand Prix at the public road Gilles Villeneuve circuit in Montreal, the death of Elio de Angelis a month earlier had created an opening at Brabham and the team hired Derek Warwick who had been left out of work after Ayrton Senna refused to have him as his Lotus teammate. Marc Surer was also missing having been very seriously injured while competing on the Hessen Rally in a Ford RS200
supercar; he never raced in Formula One again. Christian Danner was hired by Arrows but because of contractual problems had to race in Canada for Osella and so there was only one Arrows.

Qualifying resulted in pole position for Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Williams-Honda with Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Renault right with him. Nelson Piquet was third in the second Williams while Alain Prost was fourth for McLaren ahead of Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Keke Rosberg (McLaren), Gerhard Berger (Benetton), Jacques Laffite (Ligier), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham) and Warwick. Michele Alboreto was 11th in his Ferrari. In the morning warm-up Patrick Tambay suffered a suspension failure on his Lola-Ford and injured his feet in the resulting accident and so he did not start. Mansell took the lead and with Senna holding up those behind him, Mansell seemed to be in a very strong position. Behind Senna were Prost, Piquet, Rosberg, Arnoux and the rest. Rosberg soon overtook Piquet. On the fifth lap Prost finally made it ahead of Senna and the Brazilian went wide and was pushed back to sixth behind Piquet and Arnoux. On lap 13 Rosberg overtook Prost for second and four laps later the Finn took the lead. His fuel consumption was too much., however, and so Rosberg had to back off which enabled Mansell and Prost to close up. As they came up to lap former world champion Alan Jones on lap 22 Rosberg left a small gap and Mansell took the lead again. Mansell pulled away to win the race, and Prost retook Rosberg for second place but he then had a slow pit stop caused by a sticking wheelnut and dropped back to fifth. He spent the rest of the race charging back to take second by the finish. Piquet was third with Rosberg fourth having had to slow to conserve fuel in the closing laps while the troubled Senna was fifth and Arnoux sixth.

===Race 7: Detroit (USA)===
Bernie Ecclestone had arranged a convoy to travel from Montreal to Detroit, which would take place a week after the Canadian Grand Prix. Detroit was the only 1986 Formula One Grand Prix in the United States; this unpopular race on a very bumpy, rough, tight and angular street circuit lined with unforgiving concrete walls in the middle of downtown Detroit was widely accepted as the toughest and most demanding Grand Prix of the year. With Patrick Tambay recovering from his leg injuries from Canada, the Beatrice Lola team hired Eddie Cheever for the weekend, while Christian Danner transferred from Osella to Arrows to replace the injured Marc Surer and so Canadian Allen Berg took over the second of the Italian cars. Qualifying resulted in another pole position for Senna in his Lotus-Renault, which had the best chassis and suspension and was able to deal with the bumps and roughness of Detroit better than any of the other cars. The two Williams-Hondas of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet were second and third, Rene Arnoux was fourth in the Ligier-Renault ahead of Stefan Johansson&#x27;s Ferrari and Jacques Laffite in the second Ligier. Then came Alain Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG, Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Brabham-BMW, Keke Rosberg&#x27;s McLaren and Cheever. As was usually the case in Detroit, it was hot and humid, and at the start Senna took the lead with Mansell second under pressure from Arnoux. On the second lap Senna missed a gear and Mansell went ahead, quickly leaving Senna to fight with Arnoux. Mansell was in trouble with brakes, however, and so Senna was soon able to catch him again and on the eighth lap Senna took the lead again. He was also on harder tires than Mansell so he was well placed for a victory. Mansell dropped back behind Arnoux and Laffite. On lap 12, however, Senna had a puncture and had to pit and so there was a Ligier 1–2 with Arnoux leading Laffite for a couple of laps before Jacques went ahead. Mansell was third with Prost fourth, Piquet fifth and Senna sixth. The pit stops got rid of the Ligiers as a competitive force, the team being much slower than the other front-runners and with Piquet and Mansell both slower than they should have been, Senna was ahead again when the stops were over. Piquet then crashed on the straight before the pits and the car was hit by Arnoux, who then tried to keep going and reversed into the path of Thierry Boutsen&#x27;s Arrows. This left Senna a long way ahead of Prost with Laffite third and closing. Prost had a misfire and could do nothing to stop Laffite taking second before the finish. Fourth place went to Alboreto with Mansell fifth after he had been up an escape road and Patrese was sixth.

===Race 8: France===
Elio de Angelis&#x27;s fatal accident had led the Paul Ricard authorities to shorten the circuit dramatically and it now cut through on the 2.3 mile (3.8 km) racing school circuit, which took out the high-speed esses where de Angelis had crashed and reduced the length of the Mistral Straight. Patrick Tambay was back in action with the Haas Lola team after missing the Detroit GP because of leg injuries from an accident in Canada. Tambay also had a new engineer, Adrian Newey having been hired from the March Indycar project. In the days before the race, FISA had also announced plans to introduce a new 3.5-liter normally-aspirated formula in 1989. Qualifying resulted in another pole position for Senna in his Lotus-Renault with the two Williams-Hondas of Mansell and Piquet second and third. Arnoux was fourth in the Ligier-Renault ahead of Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG/Porsche. Then came Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari, Keke Rosberg&#x27;s McLaren, the Benetton-BMWs of Gerhard Berger and Teo Fabi and Johansson&#x27;s Ferrari. At the start Alboreto stalled and was left behind while Mansell took the lead from Senna, Arnoux, Berger, Prost, a fast-starting Johnny Dumfries in the second Lotus, Piquet and Rosberg. Fabi collided with Warwick&#x27;s Brabham during the first lap and both had to pit. On the fifth lap Senna went off at the very fast Signes corner on oil left by Andrea de Cesaris&#x27;s exploding Minardi-Motori Moderni. The Lotus hit the barriers and Senna was out- which was the same place Senna had crashed at the French Grand Prix the year before. Mansell was left alone at the front with Arnoux second and Berger under pressure from both McLarens. They soon passed the Benetton while later ran into Christian Danner&#x27;s Arrows and had to pit for repairs. Prost and Rosberg chased after Arnoux and were both ahead of the Ligier by lap 18. Mansell had two tire stops and Prost was briefly in the lead but with new rubber and no fuel problems, Mansell was able to retake the lead on lap 58 and went on to win the race. Prost was second. Piquet was struggling with electrical trouble all afternoon but managed to overtake Rosberg to finish third while the top six was completed by the two Ligiers of Arnoux and Laffite.

===Race 9: Britain===
There was a massive crowd at the British Grand Prix at the challenging Brands Hatch circuit just outside London, with many locals turning out hoping to see home favorite Mansell win. Jacques Laffite was due to equal Graham Hill&#x27;s record of 176 Grand Prix starts and the popular Frenchman was hoping for a good performance at Brands Hatch as the Ligier-Renault had been very competitive. Williams celebrated the return of team boss Frank Williams to the F1 paddock for the first time since he was paralyzed in a road accident in March. There was considerable action on the engine front with Ligier announcing a three-year deal for 1987-88-89 with Alfa Romeo and Team Lotus negotiating for Honda engines. The entry was unchanged from the French GP and in qualifying the two Williams-Hondas were dominant with Nelson Piquet ahead of Nigel Mansell. Ayrton Senna was third in his Lotus-Renault ahead of Gerhard Berger (Benetton-BMW), the McLaren-TAGs of Keke Rosberg and Alain Prost, Teo Fabi&#x27;s Benetton, Rene Arnoux&#x27;s Ligier, Derek Warwick&#x27;s Brabham and Johnny Dumfries in the second Lotus. Laffite had a bad qualifying and was 19th. At the start Mansell&#x27;s Williams failed as he went into Paddock Hill Bend. He was fortunate however because moments later the race was stopped following a multiple crash behind him. This was caused by Thierry Boutsen losing control of his Arrows in the midfield. This bounced off the wall into the backmarkers and Stefan Johansson jinked right to avoid it. Unfortunately Laffite was alongside him and the Ligier had to swerve and went head-on into the barrier. Back on the track Boutsen was hit by Piercarlo Ghinzani (Osella) and by Christian Danner (Arrows) and the accident also involved the two Minardis, the two Zakspeeds and Allen Berg&#x27;s Osella. Laffite was cut from the wreckage of his car and then flown to hospital but with both legs broken at the age of 42, his Formula 1 career was over. Zakspeed driver Palmer, who is a qualified general practitioner, was the first doctor to be on the scene and came in the aid of his fellow competitor. It took nearly an hour and a half before the race was restarted and Mansell (in the spare car) followed Piquet into the first corner with Berger getting ahead of the second Williams in the course of the first lap. Mansell soon retook the Benetton and went after Piquet. Senna was fourth under pressure from Rosberg but the Finn went out soon afterwards with a gearbox failure and so Prost was fifth ahead of Alboreto. Prost pitted early for new tires (his original set having been out of balance) and he dropped back while Berger went out on lap 23 with electrical trouble. On the same lap Piquet missed a gear and Mansell went ahead, to the delight of the British fans. Soon afterwards the third-placed Senna went into the pits to retire with a gearbox problem. The Williams-Hondas battled for the rest of the afternoon but Mansell stayed ahead to win. Arnoux had run third early on but a bad choice of tires meant he had to stop twice and so Prost took the position with Arnoux fourth ahead of the two Tyrrells of Martin Brundle and Philippe Streiff, the Frenchman overtaking Warwick on the last lap as the Englishman had to conserve fuel. This was the last Formula One Grand Prix at Brands Hatch; from 1987 onwards the British Grand Prix would be held at Silverstone.

===Race 10: Germany===
Jacques Laffite&#x27;s accident at Brands Hatch meant that Ligier needed a new driver and Philippe Alliot was hired to replace him for the German Grand Prix at the very fast and forested Hockenheim circuit. Team Lotus announced that it would be using Honda engines in 1987 with Ayrton Senna being joined by Satoru Nakajima. Arrows had the new A9 chassis for the first time while Keke Rosberg announced that he would be retiring from Formula One at the end of the season and then took pole position for McLaren, ahead of his teammate Alain Prost, the team having benefited from the arrival of new turbochargers. Ayrton Senna was third with Gerhard Berger fourth for Benetton with Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell next in their Williams-Hondas. The top 10 was completed by Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW), Rene Arnoux (Ligier-Renault), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari. At the start Senna took the lead as the two McLaren-TAGs were slightly slower off the line. This enabled Berger to grab second from Rosberg and Piquet to get ahead of Prost. Further back Alliot made a good start but then knocked Stefan Johansson into a spin, collecting Fabi&#x27;s Benetton as it went. Johansson and Alliot both pitted at the end of the lap. Rosberg soon took the lead from Senna and Berger was overtaken by Piquet and it was not long before Piquet was ahead of Senna as well. Berger pitted on lap five with an engine problem. While this was going on Piquet closed on Rosberg and took the lead on lap six. Prost was ahead of Senna with Arnoux fifth and Mansell sixth, complaining of poor handling. Things were so bad that Nigel was overtaken by Alboreto and only regained sixth when the Ferrari went out with transmission failure on lap seven. Piquet decided to go for two stops and so pitted early leaving the McLarens running 1–2 ahead of Senna but when they pitted Piquet went ahead again and although he dropped behind them again when he stopped again he was able to overtake both by the finish. On the penultimate lap both McLarens ran out of fuel and so Senna took second place with Mansell third, Arnoux fourth and Rosberg and Prost being classified fifth and sixth.

===Race 11: Hungary===
The World Championship headed behind the Iron Curtain for the first time to the new Hungaroring, outside Budapest, and there was an enthusiastic welcome for the Formula 1 circus. The very modern track was rather twisty and overtaking would be difficult. Traffic was a problem in qualifying but as usual Ayrton Senna was on pole in his Lotus-Renault with Nelson Piquet second in the Williams-Honda ahead of Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG), World Championship leader Nigel Mansell (Williams-Honda) and Keke Rosberg in the second McLaren. The top 10 was completed by Patrick Tambay in the Lola-Ford, Stefan Johansson&#x27;s Ferrari, Johnny Dumfries in the second Lotus, Rene Arnoux&#x27;s Ligier and Alan Jones&#x27;s Lola. There was a vast crowd, estimated to be more than 200,000 on race day and at the start Senna went into the lead while Mansell blasted ahead of Prost and Piquet to grab second place. Piquet soon showed that he was very competitive by passing Mansell for second. Tambay had started well and overtook Prost on the first lap but he was soon repassed by the McLaren and by his teammate Jones. On lap 11 Prost moved ahead of Mansell and a lap later Piquet took the lead from Senna, who fell back towards Prost&#x27;s McLaren. Alain soon pitted with an electrical problem and this upset Rosberg&#x27;s race as he pitted for tires at the same time and had to be waved through. McLaren ceased to be a force. This meant that Mansell was third with Dumfries fourth and Berger fifth. In the middle of the race Piquet pitted for tires while Senna stayed out and charged hard and so that when he pitted he was able to rejoin in the lead. The gap came quickly down and Piquet went ahead again and the two cars then ran close together all the way to the finish but Piquet stayed ahead with Senna settling for second and Mansell third. Johansson claimed fourth with Dumfries fifth and Martin Brundle sixth in his Tyrrell. The result meant that there were four men covered by 11 points in the World Championship race: Mansell, Senna, Piquet and Prost.

===Race 12: Austria===
A week after Hungary, the teams were in action again at the fastest circuit of the year, the scenic and spectacular Österreichring in Austria and it was a surprise to see the two Benetton-BMWs on the front row with Fabi two-tenths faster than home favorite Berger; these cars were not only the most powerful cars on the grid with the Brabhams and Arrows cars but also along with the Williams and McLarens among the most aerodynamically efficient cars. Rosberg was third quickest in his McLaren-TAG/Porsche but the good performance from BMW was highlighted by Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s fourth place for Brabham. Prost was fifth in his McLaren and then came the regular front-runners and World Championship contenders Mansell and Piquet in their Williams-Hondas and Senna in his Lotus-Renault. The top 10 was completed by Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari and Derek Warwick&#x27;s Brabham. Brabham had problems in the warm-up and so Warwick had to hand over his car to Patrese and the Briton was not able to take the start. At the start Berger took the lead from Fabi, Prost, Mansell, Piquet, Rosberg and Senna. The Benettons were highly competitive and pulled quickly away from the field while Senna soon disappeared with electrical trouble. On lap 17 Fabi went into the lead only to have his engine fail and so Berger went ahead again. Prost stopped for new tires and so Mansell moved to second. This became the lead a few minutes later when Berger pitted with an electrical problem. Mansell pitted and so Prost went into the lead while Piquet disappeared with an engine problem. Almost immediately Mansell too went out with a broken driveshaft. This left Prost by himself at the front with the two Ferraris running second and third, with Alboreto ahead of Stefan Johansson. The two Haas Lolas were fourth and fifth with Alan Jones ahead of Patrick Tambay while the final point went to Christian Danner&#x27;s Arrows.

===Race 13: Italy===
The big news at the Monza Autodrome near Milan was that McLaren designer John Barnard was leaving to join the Ferrari team. The new AGS was in the paddock for the first time with Ivan Capelli driving the Motori Moderni-engined chassis (which was, in fact, an old Renault Sport one with AGS bodywork). This had previously been tested by Didier Pironi. Michele Alboreto was in difficulties having crashed a motorcycle and injured his shoulder. The Osella team had replaced Allen Berg with local rising star Alex Caffi but otherwise the field was as normal. Qualifying resulted in the Teo Fabi taking pole in his Benetton with Alain Prost second for McLaren ahead of Mansell&#x27;s Williams, Berger&#x27;s Benetton, Senna&#x27;s Lotus and the second Williams of Piquet. The top 10 was completed by Derek Warwick (Brabham-BMW), Keke Rosberg (McLaren), Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham). Before the start Fabi and Prost both had trouble and while Fabi had to start from the back of the grid, Prost went to his spare car in the pitlane. As a result, the front row was gone and this enabled Berger to take the lead from Mansell on the run down to the first corner. Senna suffered an immediate transmission failure and retired. The result of all of this was that Berger led Mansell, Piquet, a fast-starting Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Rosberg and Alboreto. In the early laps Alboreto moved ahead of Arnoux and the front four then began to pull away from the rest of the field. At the end of the seventh lap Mansell went into the lead and he was followed through by Piquet and Alboreto as Berger backed off to conserve fuel. In the meantime Prost and Fabi were charging up through the field, Prost getting to sixth by lap 18. The McLaren was then black-flagged for an illegal switch of cars. It mattered little because his TAG engine blew soon afterwards. During the tires stops Alboreto spun and glanced a barrier and had to stop for repairs. This dropped the Ferrari out of the battle for the lead. Piquet now charged up to Mansell and took the lead, pulling away to win a dominant victory and moved himself back to second in the World Championship. Mansell&#x27;s second place meant that he was still five points ahead. Johansson finished third with Rosberg fourth, Berger fifth and Alan Jones sixth in the Haas Lola.

===Race 14: Portugal===
The Portuguese Grand Prix at the Estoril Autodrome near Lisbon was moved to September instead of being held in April. The field was as it had been at Monza except that Allen Berg was back in the second Osella after the car had been driven by Alex Caffi in Italy. Pirelli announced that it was withdrawing from Grand Prix racing at the end of the year and Renault said that it too had decided not to continue supplying F1 engines for the 1987 season. Ferrari had also announced that it had signed up Gerhard Berger to replace Stefan Johansson. Qualifying resulted in another pole position for Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus-Renault while Nigel Mansell was second fastest in his Williams-Honda with Alain Prost third for McLaren and Berger fourth in his Benetton. Then came Fabi, Piquet, Rosberg, Johansson, Patrese, and Arnoux. At the start Mansell went into the lead and he remained there for the rest of the afternoon to win an impressive victory. Senna followed him and only dropped from second when he stopped for tires in the mid-race. On the last lap, however, he started to run out of fuel and dropped from second to fourth, promoting Prost to second and Piquet to third. The two Ferraris of Johansson and Michele Alboreto picked up fifth and sixth.

===Race 15: Mexico===
It had been 16 years since the last Mexican GP (the country that hosted the football World Cup earlier that year) and the same circuit, now called the Rodriguez Brothers Autodrome in the heart of Mexico City had been completely rebuilt was a shorter circuit than the original but despite resurfacing work it was very bumpy, thanks to Mexico City&#x27;s geologically active surface. The circuit was located 7,380 feet above sea level- even higher than the Kyalami circuit in South Africa, of which this event was replacing. The only change from the field at the Portuguese GP was that AGS had not made the trip to Mexico. Qualifying was a familiar story with Senna on pole in his JPS Lotus-Renault. Then came Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell in their Williams-Hondas with Gerhard Berger fourth in his Benetton-BMW. Next up was Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW) ahead of Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG/Porsche), Derek Warwick in the second Brabham, Patrick Tambay in the Haas Lola, Teo Fabi&#x27;s Benetton and Philippe Alliot in the Ligier-Renault. The Ferraris were not competitive. Mansell was in the position to win the World Championship if he could score a good result but at the start he made a mess of it and was left at the back of the field. Piquet and Senna were running first and second. Berger was third with Prost fourth. On the seventh lap Prost got ahead of Berger. Mansell charged up through the backmarkers but then had to pit for new tires. The only man not to do so was Berger, who reckoned that he might be able to go the distance on his Pirelli tires. When the other front-runners returned to action they were not able to close on Berger because the Goodyears were blistering in the heat. Piquet had led comfortably until a suspension issue cost him several seconds per lap, and forced 3 pitstops in the last few laps, dropping him from the lead to 4th.

Berger thus took his first Formula 1 victory, followed home by Prost and Senna. Piquet and Mansell were fourth and fifth - Mansell had caught right up to Piquet but was unable to pass his team-mate, who needed the points to retain a mathematical chance of the championship himself, and set the fastest lap of the race in response to Mansell&#x27;s challenge: while the final point went to Alliot. As the F1 circus headed off to Australia Mansell was still in a dominant position in the World Championship six points clear of Prost and seven ahead of Piquet.

===Race 16: Australia===
The most dramatic and exciting race of the 1980s, the 1986 race in Adelaide saw the showdown of a three-way fight for the World Championship between Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost and Nelson Piquet. Mansell had 70 points, six more than Prost and seven more than Piquet. Prost&#x27;s McLaren-TAG was no match for the Williams-Hondas – which had lapped the Frenchman at several races – although Alain had collected points all year while the Williams pair fought one another. Mansell was on pole ahead of Piquet and Ayrton Senna (Lotus-Renault). Prost was fourth followed by Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Gerhard Berger (Benetton), Keke Rosberg (McLaren), Philippe Alliot (Ligier), Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Ferrari and Philippe Streiff&#x27;s Tyrrell.

At the second corner of the race, Senna forced his way into the lead. Piquet and Rosberg followed him past Mansell and on that first lap Piquet overtook Senna to take the lead. On the next lap Senna dropped behind Rosberg and on lap 4 behind Mansell. Two laps later Prost was also ahead of Senna.

On lap 7 Rosberg overtook Piquet and began to build a lead while a little later Prost got ahead of Mansell and chased after Piquet. On lap 23 Nelson spun. Prost&#x27;s hopes seemed to evaporate a few laps later when he had a puncture and had to pit. He was back in fourth again.
Piquet charged back from his spin, passing Mansell for second place on lap 44 but Prost closed on his two Williams driver and with 25 laps to go all three were running together.

On lap 63 the battle became one for the lead, when Rosberg suffered a right rear tire failure. Mansell was on course for the title when two laps later on the Dequetteville Terrace (Brabham Straight) his left rear tire exploded at 180 mph. Nigel managed to avoid hitting anything, but his championship hopes were over. Williams had no choice but to call Piquet to the pits and so Prost went into the lead.

Piquet closed the gap from fifteen seconds to four but Prost won the race and the World Championship after a breathtakingly exciting race. Third place in the race went to Stefan Johansson in his last race for Ferrari with Martin Brundle fourth in his Tyrrell. Streiff was fifth and Johnny Dumfries (Lotus) sixth.

In SKY TV&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the crypt&quot; Mansell said that at the end of year FIA Paris prizegiving, Bertie Martin, the Clerk of the Course at Adelaide, told him that had he hit the wall and debris covered the track, he would have red-flagged the race and as two thirds race distance had been completed Mansell would have been world champion.

<text>The 1985 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 39th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1985 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1985 Formula One World Championship for Manufacturers, both of which commenced on 7 April and ended on 3 November after sixteen races.

The Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Alain Prost. After finishing two years as runner-up, both times winning more races than the champion, he was able to clinch the title this year sealing his success at the European Grand Prix. It would be first of four championships for &quot;the Professor&quot;. Michele Alboreto was his main challenger, but he failed to score points in all of the last five races of the season.

The Manufacturers&#x27; Championship was won by McLaren for the second consecutive year.

Reigning champion Niki Lauda retired after this season, although team boss Ron Dennis tried to convince him otherwise.

After eight years, Michelin had withdrawn from the sport, leaving Pirelli and Goodyear as tyre suppliers for 1985.

== Drivers and constructors ==
=== Team changes ===
* ATS had folded after the season.
* Minardi entered the sport as a constructor after four years of experience in Formula Two. They collaborated with ex-Alfa Romeo engineer Carlo Chiti to run Motori Moderni V6 turbo engines. When met with delays, Minardi had to convert their M185 chassis to accept off-the-rack Cosworth V8&#x27;s.
* Zakspeed signed in as a constructor with their own engine, only the fourth team on the grid to do so. They entered ten of the sixteen races on the calendar.

==== Mid-season changes ====
* After two races, Minardi could take delivery of the promised Motori Moderni engines and could revert their chassis back to the original design.
* Spirit folded after three races.
* Toleman could not get a supply of tyres after aggravating both Pirelli and Goodyear. It was only after the Spirit team folded that Toleman, with money from their sponsor Benetton, were able to purchase Pirelli tyres and start racing.
* Tyrrell switched from Ford-Cosworth V8&#x27;s to Renault V6 turbo&#x27;s after the Detroit Grand Prix, the last team on the grid to make the change.
* Haas Lola signed in for the 1985 season as the third new constructor of the year, but encountered delays in the development of their first car, and the specially designed Ford-Cosworth V6 turbo was not ready either. So their first chassis had to be thoroughly adjusted to be powered by a four-cylinder Hart turbo engine and could only make its debut in the Italian Grand Prix. It would not be until the third race of that the team could get delivery of the Cosworth engine and switch to their second car, specifically designed around it.
* RAM folded with two races left in the season.

=== Driver changes ===

* In an off-season with relatively little driver switches, biggest news was Ayrton Senna&#x27;s promotion to Lotus. He would replace Nigel Mansell who was signed by Williams.
* Brabham hired François Hesnault from Equipe Ligier, where ex-Williams driver Jacques Laffite took his seat.
* Teo Fabi had driven 12 races for Brabham in , but was dropped for 1985. He found a new home with Toleman.
* Gerhard Berger had made his debut in 1984 with ATS. After they folded, he was signed by Arrows for his first full season. Berger&#x27;s ATS teammate Manfred Winkelhock moved to RAM. Ex-RAM driver Jonathan Palmer was signed by Zakspeed.
* After one weekend in 1984, when he fell in for Senna at Toleman, Pierluigi Martini made his full-season debut at Minardi. He would eventually spend eight out of his nine years in F1 with the Italian team.

==== Mid-season changes ====

* Stefan Johansson had signed with Toleman but pulled out of his contract amid the team&#x27;s tyre woes. He substituted for Stefan Bellof at Tyrrell at the first race of the season and then moved to Ferrari when René Arnoux suddenly left. He ended staying with the Italian team until the end of .
* After four disappointing results, François Hesnault was sacked from Brabham and replaced by Marc Surer. The Frenchman made one further appearance with Renault. As of 2024, this appearance for Renault in the German Grand Prix is the last time a Formula 1 team started three cars in a Grand Prix race.
* When Haas Lola made their long-awaited debut in the Italian Grand Prix, it was veteran driver Alan Jones behind the wheel. He would also drive for them during the whole season before retiring from the sport.
* RAM driver Manfred Winkelhock suffered a fatal accident during the Budweiser 1000 km World Sportscar Championship event. Ex-RAM driver Kenny Acheson took over the drive for three races before the team folded.
* Stefan Bellof was also racing in the World Sportscar Championship until he came together with Jacky Ickx in the 1000 km of Spa. Both drivers crashed and Bellof lost his life. At Tyrrell, Ivan Capelli and Philippe Streiff alternated as replacement drivers for the final three races of the season.
* Huub Rothengatter replaced Piercarlo Ghinzani at Osella midway through the season, when the Italian moved to Toleman.
* After Andrea de Cesaris crashed in the Austrian Grand Prix and rolled his car four times, team boss Guy Ligier&#x27;s patience with the accident-prone Italian had run out and he replaced him with Philippe Streiff.
* Inaugural F3000 champion Christian Danner raced two weekends for Zakspeed instead of Jonathan Palmer. Palmer had been injured after a practice crash in the 1000 km of Spa, just a few days prior to Bellof&#x27;s fatal accident.
* John Watson substituted for Niki Lauda at the European Grand Prix, after the Austrian had injured his wrist in qualifying for the previous race in Spa.

== Calendar ==
=== Calendar changes ===
* The Dallas Grand Prix was cancelled and did not return. This meant that, for the first time since , there was just one race in the United States.
* From this year on, Spa-Francorchamps would be the permanent home of the Belgian Grand Prix and Circuit Zolder would be cut out (under FISA&#x27;s &quot;one country, one circuit&quot; rule) For the same reason, the French Grand Prix would be permanently held at Paul Ricard Circuit and Dijon-Prenois was dropped.
*The British Grand Prix was moved to Silverstone from Brands Hatch, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the German Grand Prix returned to the Nürburgring for the first time since , and replacing the Hockenheimring. By FISA orders these agreements were suspended and, from on, Silverstone and Hockenheim would become the permanent hosts of the British and German Grands Prix. The Nürburgring would return in 1995, as European Grand Prix.
* The South African Grand Prix was moved back from April (in the season) to October. Likewise, the French Grand Prix was move back from May to July. The Portuguese Grand Prix was brought up from being the final round of the 1984 championship to be the second race in 1985.
* The Australian Grand Prix was added to the calendar for the first time, immediately getting the honor of closing the season.

==== Mid-season changes ====
* The Belgian Grand Prix was originally scheduled on 2 June, but during Friday practice, the asphalt broke up and overnight repairs were necessary. Half an hour into Saturday practice, all running was ceased and the race was canceled. The Grand Prix was postponed until 15 September and the track was thoroughly repaired in the meantime.

==== Provisional calendar ====
Originally, the 1985 calendar had a record number of 19 Grands Prix (2 more than the previous record in ).
* The Brazilian Grand Prix was due to take place on 10 March, with the Dallas Grand Prix as the second round on 24 March. However, the Texas race was cancelled because of financial problems, safety and organisational concerns.
* The Japanese Grand Prix was due to return after eight years and was scheduled for 7 April. However, it was cancelled as the rebuilding of parts of the Suzuka Circuit was delayed. It would last another two years for the race to be held at Suzuka.
* A final attempt to put on a Grand Prix in New York City was scheduled for 22 September, but the race was cancelled for the third year in a row.
* Then, the Hungarian Grand Prix at the Népliget Park Circuit appeared on a provisional calendar to be held on 22 September, but was cancelled, as plans for a race in the park were difficult to achieve and the decision was made to build a new circuit: the Hungaroring in Mogyoród outside the city of Budapest would have its first race in 1986.
* The European Grand Prix was going to be held in the Esposizione Universale Roma (EUR) district in Rome on 13 October, but it was moved to Brands Hatch and held one week earlier.
* The Spanish Grand Prix at a new circuit in Fuengirola appeared on a provisional calendar and was cancelled for the second year in a row, this time due to organisational problems. In the end a decision was made to build a new circuit in Jerez where the race would be held from 1986.
* The Mexican Grand Prix, originally to be held on 17 November as the final round was cancelled after the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed much of the Mexican capital.

== Regulation changes ==

=== Technical regulations ===
All chassis would now have to pass a frontal crash test before the manufacturer was eligible to enter it for a Grand Prix.

=== Sporting regulations ===
From this season on, the FIA required that teams enter no more than two cars for a race. Renault did enter three cars for the German Grand Prix, so only two of their cars were eligible for championship points. Interestingly, the third car was driven by François Hesnault, who had an onboard camera mounted to the car, showing live pictures for the first time in Formula 1 history. This was the last time a team entered more than two cars.

== Season report ==

=== Race 1: Brazil ===
The first race of the season was the Brazilian Grand Prix in April, at the Autodromo De Jacarepagua in Rio de Janeiro. Michele Alboreto took pole in his Ferrari ahead of Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Honda and the two Lotuses of Ayrton Senna and Elio de Angelis. Rosberg retired with turbo failure, and McLaren-TAG/Porsche driver Alain Prost took 2nd after taking advantage of an accident involving Briton Nigel Mansell at the start. Prost chased Alboreto during the first half, unable to pass because of the Ferrari&#x27;s superior straight-line speed. However, on the pit straight, Alboreto missed a gear, allowing Prost to take the lead and win the race from Alboreto and Elio de Angelis.

=== Race 2: Portugal ===
The 4½-month-long European tour started with the news that Ferrari driver René Arnoux had been sacked and replaced by Swede Stefan Johansson. No official explanation has ever been given by either Ferrari or Arnoux for the dismissal. The Portuguese Grand Prix was held at the Estoril Circuit near the capital of Lisbon. Although the practice sessions were held in good weather, it rained heavily for the race. Conditions were extremely difficult, and Ayrton Senna drove a race often regarded as one of Formula One&#x27;s great wet-weather drives. He led the race from start to finish, and lapped everyone except 2nd-placed Alboreto on the way to his debut victory.

=== Race 3: San Marino (Imola, Italy) ===
The first of two Italian races was held at the fast Autodromo Dino Ferrari near Bologna. Ayrton Senna took pole again, and led until the final laps when his car ran out of fuel. The lead was taken by Stefan Johansson, who had started 15th and then dropped to 17th, but he too ran out of fuel after an electronics failure. Prost then took the lead, and barely made it over the finish line after having also run out of fuel. Prost was later disqualified for his car being underweight, and victory was handed to Elio de Angelis driving a Lotus-Renault.

=== Race 4: Monaco ===
The Monaco Grand Prix was originally supposed to be cancelled due to political wrangling, but it took place as scheduled. After pole-sitter Senna went out with engine problems, Alboreto took the lead, followed by Prost. Alboreto then slid on some oil at the first corner which had been dropped from the gearbox of Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Alfa Romeo after a collision with Nelson Piquet&#x27;s Brabham-BMW. Prost took the lead after Alboreto&#x27;s slip-up, but the Italian took the lead again from the Frenchman at the same place where he had gone off. However, another accident involving Patrese and Piquet caused more problems: Alboreto then punctured a tire, came into the pits to get his tires changed, dropping to 4th place behind Prost, and de Angelis and Andrea de Cesaris. He passed his fellow countrymen, but was not able to catch Prost, who won ahead of him and de Angelis.

=== Race 5: Canada ===
There was a 4-week gap between the Monaco and Canadian Grands Prix as the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps was postponed until September, after the newly-laid track surface, to help deal with wet weather, melted due to the hot weather conditions. The Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal produced a Ferrari 1–2, with Alboreto winning ahead of Johansson, and Prost finishing third. It was Ferrari&#x27;s first 1–2 since the 1983 Dutch Grand Prix and their last until the 1987 Australian Grand Prix.

=== Race 6: Detroit (USA) ===
The slowest and toughest race of the year was in the United States, at the angular Renaissance Center street circuit in the center of downtown Detroit, Michigan. Ayrton Senna took pole, 1.2 seconds ahead of the next fastest qualifier, Nigel Mansell. The Lotus combined with Senna&#x27;s raw driving talent proved to be well-suited to slow tracks, and Senna decided to take a chance by using harder tires than the rest of the field and try to go a greater distance. The Detroit Grand Prix, classic for being a race of attrition was no different as Keke Rosberg passed Prost, Mansell and Senna to take the lead – a lead he kept from start to finish on a circuit that, under the intense heat and humidity, broke up and made half the field retire. Prost, Mansell and Senna all crashed at the same corner at Atwater and St. Antoine Streets. Behind Rosberg were the two Ferraris of Johansson and Alboreto, the former pushing Rosberg hard for the lead.

=== Race 7: France ===
F1 returned to Europe to start the second European tour with the French Grand Prix at the very fast Circuit Paul Ricard with its long 1.1 mile Mistral straight. Keke Rosberg took pole position, averaging more than 140 mph. He was ahead of Senna, Alboreto, Prost and Nelson Piquet. The weather was hot, and after gaining places at the start, double world champion Piquet made the most of his BMW engine&#x27;s superior power (this engine was the most powerful in F1 at the time) and Pirelli tires. After moving up to third at the start, Piquet passed Senna on the Mistral Straight, and then passed the leader Rosberg on Lap 11. Senna went into the pits and fell down the order; while driving hard to make up places he crashed heavily at the very fast Signes corner after the Mistral Straight when the Renault engine in his Lotus failed and dropped oil on the rear tires, and the car caught fire. Senna escaped uninjured. Rosberg had wrecked his tires early on, and was harried by Prost and his teammate, defending champion Niki Lauda. After a long battle where Rosberg held up the two McLarens and allowed Piquet to get away, Lauda retired with gearbox failure (the Austrian had only finished once in the season thus far), Prost eventually took Rosberg, who went into the pits to have his tires changed. Rosberg stormed after Prost, who was putting considerable pressure on Piquet. The Finn eventually passed Prost for 2nd, behind Piquet, in what was the 35th and last win of Brabham.

During qualifying, the turbocharged Brabham-BMW of Marc Surer reached a season-fastest on the Mistral Straight. This compared to the fastest (and only) non-turbo car, the Tyrrell-Ford V8 of Stefan Bellof who was recorded at .

=== Race 8: Great Britain ===
F1 went to England for the British Grand Prix, this year being held at Silverstone, which was the fastest Grand Prix circuit in the world at the time. Rosberg outlined this by averaging 160.9 mph in qualifying – more than 7 mph faster than the pole time set for the 1983 British GP. Senna, after starting 4th, took the lead at the start. He led for most of the race distance, after Rosberg and others fell out with mechanical trouble. Prost had dropped back early on to save fuel, and then climbed through the field to catch Senna. Prost&#x27;s McLaren was well suited to fast circuits, and he pressured Senna. In an effort to stay in front of Prost, Senna turned the Renault&#x27;s engine&#x27;s turbo boost up, and this caused him to run out of fuel and retire from the race. After that, Prost built a huge lead, and lapped the rest of the field, including Alboreto, who finished 2nd. The chequered flag was shown in error at the end of the 65th lap, ending the race one lap before its scheduled distance. Jacques Laffite, who finished in 3rd place, ran out of fuel on what was supposed to be the last lap, the error thus depriving 4th placed Nelson Piquet of a podium finish.

=== Race 9: Germany ===
The German Grand Prix 1985 was held at the Nürburgring instead of the Hockenheimring like in previous years, although instead of the historic Nordschleife being used, the new GP track was utilized for the second time in Formula 1 history after being the European Grand Prix in 1984. After Senna and Rosberg collided while being harried by Alboreto, Prost and Jacques Laffite in a Ligier-Renault, Alboreto in his Ferrari took advantage of a rare spin by Prost to take his last F1 victory. This event was the first occasion on which an onboard camera was used in a race; on François Hesnault&#x27;s Renault car. That car was not eligible for championship points, and this race marked the last time that an F1 team entered more than two cars for a race.

=== Race 10: Austria ===
The extremely fast Österreichring was the venue for the Austrian Grand Prix, which was dominated by McLaren drivers Prost and Lauda. Prost took pole at an average speed of more than 155 mph (250 km/h). The McLaren car was superior to all the others on this track, and after Lauda fell out with turbo failure, Prost took victory ahead of Senna and Alboreto. Ligier-Renault driver Andrea de Cesaris crashed heavily after making a mistake and losing his car at the Texaco bends, but emerged unscathed, thanks to the grassy surface made soft by rain the night before. He was fired from the Ligier team soon afterwards.

=== Race 11: Netherlands ===
The beach-side Circuit Park Zandvoort near Amsterdam hosted the Dutch Grand Prix. After pole-sitter Piquet stalled at the start, Rosberg took the lead, but the McLarens were to show their high-speed circuit superiority once again: after Rosberg retired with engine failure, Prost took the lead, ahead of Senna and Lauda. Lauda eventually passed the Brazilian, and took the lead from Prost while the Frenchman was in the pits. With a car that was not entirely set up to his liking, Lauda won by a car&#x27;s length from Prost, who drove very hard to catch the Austrian. This was the triple-world champion&#x27;s 25th and last Grand Prix victory, and it was also the last Dutch Grand Prix for 36 years – the track owners went bankrupt, and the back side of the Zandvoort circuit past the Marlborobocht was sold to developers.

=== Race 12: Italy ===
The Italian Grand Prix at the very fast Autodromo Nazionale di Monza saw Williams-Honda driver Rosberg dominate the race, but he retired with engine failure, and Prost took victory, ahead of Brazilians Piquet and pole-sitter Senna.

=== Race 13: Belgium ===
The rescheduled Belgian Grand Prix returned to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, a track relished by drivers, even in the wet. Niki Lauda crashed his McLaren in practice, and injured his wrist; he would not take part in this weekend or the upcoming European GP. Prost took pole ahead of Senna, but Senna took an immediate lead into La Source, ahead of Piquet and Prost. Piquet then spun, and Senna started to break away. The race began in wet conditions but later dried. After most of the drivers changed onto slick tires after the conditions were found to be too dry for wet tires, Senna led most of the race, but was challenged by Nigel Mansell most of the way. Senna won his 2nd GP from Mansell and Prost. Prost, the championship leader, now had a firm lead over his closest challenger Alboreto – if Prost gained more points in the next race, he would be Drivers&#x27; Champion. This would end up filling a gap in the calendar left by the cancellation for the third year in a row of the New York Grand Prix.

=== Race 14: Europe ===
The European Grand Prix was originally scheduled on the 1985 calendar to be held on a street circuit in Rome but due to unknown reasons it was moved to the southern English Brands Hatch circuit, normally used for the British Grand Prix on even numbered years. Senna took his 6th pole position at an average speed of more than 140 mph (228 km/h). There had been some concerns about racing these very powerful cars at the small, very fast Brands Hatch circuit: Niki Lauda and a few other drivers felt the cars were too fast for a short circuit like Brands, and if the power of the engines increased over time, the circuit would have to be modified in order to accommodate the cars.
Senna led from pole position and was followed by Rosberg. Going into Surtees, Rosberg tried to get past Senna, but Senna took his line forcefully and Rosberg spun to avoid contact. Piquet hit Rosberg and retired, but Rosberg was able to get to the pits and returned to the track right in front of Senna who was then being harried by Mansell. Rosberg then held Senna up whilst going into Surtees, which enabled Mansell to overtake into the lead.
Mansell led the rest of the race distance, while Marc Surer in a Brabham-BMW got up to 2nd, but retired at Stirling&#x27;s corner after a fire broke out on the back of his car. Meanwhile, Alboreto&#x27;s car failed and caught fire; he drove it back to the Ferrari pit while still in flames. Prost dropped to 15th at the start, but finished in 4th, which was enough for him to become world Drivers&#x27; Champion for the first time. He finished behind Mansell, Senna, and Rosberg.

=== Race 15: South Africa ===
The South African Grand Prix, held at the very fast Kyalami circuit, had been a point of contention throughout the year: South Africa&#x27;s Apartheid regime had declared a state of emergency, and controversy ensued throughout the year whether this race would take place or not. Governing body president Jean-Marie Balestre announced that the race would take place despite opposition from Renault and Ligier teams, who pulled out due to pressure from the French government. With only 20 cars starting, Nigel Mansell took pole at an average speed of 147 mph (235 km/h). Rosberg took the lead, but then went off on some oil at Crowthorne which had been dropped by Piercarlo Ghinzani&#x27;s Toleman, whose Hart engine had failed. Mansell took the lead from Rosberg and held it until the end. Rosberg drove hard and caught 2nd-placed Prost before the finish, who ran out of fuel, but was still classified 3rd to make it a Williams 1–2; Williams was the third team this year to finish a race 1–2, the others being Ferrari and McLaren. A few days after the race, it was announced that the South African GP would be struck off the calendar for 1986. This race was the last World Championship Grand Prix where laurel wreaths were given to the drivers at the podium.

=== Race 16: Australia ===
The first ever world championship Australian Grand Prix was held on a street circuit in the city of Adelaide. Senna took his seventh pole position of the season by some margin on his superior-handling Lotus-Renault. However, he lost the lead to Lauda after a delayed pit stop. Lauda and Senna battled hard, and Senna eventually took the lead. Lauda crashed on the main straight due to brake failure in what was his last Grand Prix. Senna, retired with a misfiring engine, leaving Rosberg to win ahead of the two Ligier drivers Jacques Laffite and Phillippe Streiff, whom both crashed into each other on the main straight on the last lap.

<text>The 1984 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 38th season of Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1984 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1984 Formula One World Championship for Manufacturers, both of which commenced on 25 March and ended on 21 October after sixteen races. 

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, McLaren teammates Alain Prost and Niki Lauda enjoyed a season-long duel. Prost won seven races to equal Jim Clark&#x27;s record from , over Lauda&#x27;s five, but the Austrian eventually prevailed by half a point – the smallest margin in Formula One history. It was Lauda&#x27;s third title, but his first since . Reigning champion Nelson Piquet finished fifth in the championship.

Brabham, Renault and Ferrari were the expected frontrunners, but it was McLaren who clinched the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship with a then-record margin. The combination of their talented drivers, the aerodynamics of the John Barnard-designed MP4/2 and the experience of engine supplier Porsche with fuel economy made them almost unbeatable, winning twelve of the sixteen Grands Prix. It was their first title since .

, this is the last championship for an Austrian Formula One driver. It is also the last time that the Drivers&#x27; Champion did not score a pole position during the season. Only Denny Hulme managed this earlier in . This is also the last Formula One season to feature 3 tyre suppliers.

* At the end of the season, Theodore Racing had left Formula 1. No new manufacturers entered the grid for 1984.

====Mid-season changes====
There was a clear trend of manufacturers switching from naturally aspirated engines to turbocharged engines, attracted by their power output:
* After a handful of races, Arrows was able to upgrade from their A6 chassis with Ford-Cosworth V8 to the A7 with a BMW turbo engine.
* Osella switched their focus from the Alfa Romeo V12 to a turbocharged V8.
* Spirit Racing ran one car with a Hart turbo engine, while keeping the other powered by a Cosworth V8.
The teams were careful in their approach, running the old and new cars simultaneously, before finally stepping over to turbo.

===Driver changes===

* Ferrari dropped Patrick Tambay in favour of Michele Alboreto. Tambay moved to Renault, with Derek Warwick as his teammate. Warwick had taken the seat of Alain Prost after he moved to McLaren.
* The other ex-Renault driver, Eddie Cheever, moved to Alfa Romeo, and likewise did Riccardo Patrese from Brabham. Teo Fabi, with backing from Italian dairy company Parmalat, was promoted to be the new teammate of Nelson Piquet.
* Ayrton Senna, British F3 champion and future F1 champion, made his debut with the Toleman team. Senna&#x27;s F3 rival Martin Brundle made his debut with Tyrrell.
* Another seven driver changes happened during the off-season in the lower-ranking teams.

====Mid-season changes====

* During three weekends when Teo Fabi&#x27;s commitments to CART racing took precedence, his younger brother Corrado fell in for him at Brabham. Manfred Winkelhock did this for the last race of the season, after he quit the ATS team.
* Dutch driver Huub Rothengatter made his debut with Spirit, driving eight races in the middle of the season, before handing the keys back to the team&#x27;s first driver Mauro Baldi.
* Mike Thackwell was on his way to clinch the Formula 2 title in dominant fashion and he got the attraction of several F1 teams. He entered a race with RAM and later one with Tyrrell. He also tested with Williams, but could not get a full-time seat.
* Tyrrell driver Martin Brundle crashed during practice for the Dallas Grand Prix and broke both ankles and feet. He was replaced by Stefan Johansson.
* When it was announced ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix that Ayrton Senna had signed a deal with Lotus for , the Toleman team suspended him for not informing them first. Stefan Johansson took his place for one race.
* While qualifying for the British Grand Prix, Toleman driver Johnny Cecotto crashed heavily, breaking both of his legs and practically ending his F1 career. Debutant Pierluigi Martini and Stefan Johansson took over the second car.
* Osella entered a second car for half of the races. Formula Two driver Jo Gartner was behind the wheel.
* ATS took German Formula 3 driver Gerhard Berger for 4 of the last 5 rounds of the Championship, using him for both Austria and Italy when Manfred Winkelhock was unable to start the car, and the last two races in Europe and Portugal as their sole driver.
* Philippe Streiff made his debut at the last race of the season, driving a third Renault car.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===

* The race in Long Beach was replaced by the Dallas Grand Prix. It was the third in a series of &quot;overseas&quot; events, after the Canadian Grand Prix and the Detroit Grand Prix, but this put the F1 cars in the peak of the Texas summer heat. It was the only Dallas Grand Prix to be held.
* The South African Grand Prix was now the second race of the year instead of the season finale. That honor was given to the Portuguese Grand Prix at Estoril. The Grand Prix returned to the calendar for the first time since .
* The Belgian Grand Prix was held at Circuit Zolder instead of Spa-Francorchamps, as part of an agreement to alternate between the venues, and moved up the schedule one month. In similar fashion, this year&#x27;s British Grand Prix was held at Brands Hatch instead of Silverstone and the German Grand Prix was held at the Hockenheimring instead of the Nürburgring.
* The French and San Marino Grand Prix switched places, with the race at Imola now going first.

====Provisional calendar====
* On the provisional calendar, the Spanish Grand Prix was scheduled to return after a three-year absence. It was to be contested on a new street circuit in Fuengirola, but the plan did not come to fruition.
* Formula 1 tried to organise the New York City Grand Prix, but did not manage to do so for the second year in a row.
* The first Hungarian Grand Prix was scheduled for 7 October at the Népliget Park Circuit, but this was cancelled as plans for a race failed to materialise. The race was replaced by the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.

==Regulation changes==

The FISA introduced fuel economy rules aimed at reducing speeds:
* Turbocharged cars would be limited to of fuel per race. This was mandated merely by setting the maximum volume of the fuel tank to 220 litre and demanding it to be in the centre of the car, between driver and engine. This meant teams were still free to experiment, for example with freezing the fuel inside the tank to increase its density.
* Refuelling was banned.

A superlicence was now required for all F1 drivers.

Concrete walls could replace guardrails.

==Season report==
===Round 1: Brazil===
Most of the Formula One seasons in the 1980s started at the sweltering tropical heat and humidity of the Jacarepagua Riocentro Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A 10-day test followed by the Grand Prix often was the case. In addition to a frantic start, drivers had to deal with people running across the track with the cars bearing down on those people; Briton Derek Warwick in the French factory Renault led until an incident with Niki Lauda led to suspension failure; Frenchman Alain Prost won his first Grand Prix with McLaren at the flat and rough but fast Rio circuit. This was also Ayrton Senna&#x27;s first Formula One race, he was driving for the Toleman team. Senna would prove to be the first retirement of the season when the turbo on his 4 cyl Hart engine failed on lap 8.

===Round 2: South Africa===
The South African Grand Prix was held traditionally at the fast and flowing Kyalami circuit near the high-altitude city of Johannesburg. During the race morning warm up session, Piercarlo Ghinzani had a massive accident at the fastest corner on the track, the Jukskei sweeping uphill left hander. As a result of the full fuel load in his Osella, a huge fire started which completely consumed the car, though Ghinzani escaped with only minor burns to his hands. However, it was enough for him to be withdrawn from the race.

Brazilian Nelson Piquet qualified on pole position, with Prost 2nd. The latter, however, had to start from the pit lane due to problems with his car (Prost was able to race the spare car after ignition problem with Lauda&#x27;s McLaren was solved, as the Ghinzani crash allowed McLaren extra time to fix it. If not for the crash Lauda would have had the spare and Prost would not have driven). Although the Brabhams with their highly powerful BMW turbo engines proved to be very quick on this circuit, they were very unreliable cars, mostly due to the single turbocharger of the 4 cylinder engine. In addition to Piquet retiring, his teammate Teo Fabi also retired, and Austrian Niki Lauda moved up through the field to win in his McLaren. Prost was able to carve his way from the back to 2nd place, keeping his lead in the championship. The new Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna finished 6th in the race in his Toleman under considerable back pain, scoring his first ever world championship point.

===Round 3: Belgium===
The Belgian Grand Prix was previously held at the revised Spa-Francorchamps circuit; for this year, however, it returned to the forested Zolder circuit further north. This race saw a fighting drive from Keke Rosberg, who was driving an ill-handling Williams with a Honda engine that was unbalancing the car. Ferrari&#x27;s new Italian recruit Michele Alboreto won this race from Warwick and Frenchman Rene Arnoux, driving the second Ferrari. Both McLarens failed to finish. This would be the last time the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix was held at Zolder; from the following year onwards it would return and stay at Spa.

===Round 4: San Marino (Imola, Italy)===
The San Marino Grand Prix at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari in Italy was held one week after the Belgian race. Defending champion Piquet, proving yet again his Brabham&#x27;s superiority on light fuel loads took pole position again. Amazingly, Senna did not qualify for the race after many problems with his uncompetitive Toleman, the only time in his F1 career in which he would fail to qualify. Piquet however retired in the race with another turbo failure, and Fabi retired on the same lap with the same problem. The race was won by Prost from his countryman Arnoux and Italian Elio de Angelis in a Renault-powered Lotus.

===Round 5: France===
The French Grand Prix, usually run in late June/early July was run in May at the very fast Dijon-Prenois circuit. Patrick Tambay took pole in his Renault; he finished 2nd to Niki Lauda in a McLaren that was superior to all other cars at this short circuit that was made up of long, fast corners. This would be the last time the French Grand Prix was held at the Dijon circuit; the cars were lapping in the 1 minute 2 second range during qualifying. The FIA stipulated that any lap during a Formula One event that was under a minute did not count as a completed lap.

===Round 6: Monaco===
The Monaco Grand Prix was the only Grand Prix in 1984 to be run in wet conditions. Qualifying saw Briton Martin Brundle crashing his Tyrrell at the Tabac corner, as his car overturned and landed on its left side. Brundle was uninjured, and took the spare car to qualify. In the race day, the circuit was flooded by rain, as never before in Monaco since the 1930s and the 1972 event. The organizers decided to cover the tunnel section with water, because of the dramatic difference between the very wet circuit and the almost completely dry &quot;tunnel&quot;, which was in fact the road that went under the Hotel de Paris. Prost took pole position, in front of Mansell. As the drivers went away, there was an accident at the Saint-Devote corner during the start between both the Renaults of Tambay and Warwick; Tambay injured his legs (due to the design of the cars back then where the driver&#x27;s feet were not required to be behind the front axle, as is the rule today) and had to be carried off the circuit on a stretcher. As the rain came down, Mansell spun his Lotus on the climb up to the Massenet corner after touching a slippery white line. Prost took the lead, although he was pacing himself in comparison to rookie drivers Ayrton Senna in a Toleman and Stefan Bellof in a naturally-aspirated Tyrrell. Senna and Bellof pushed hard in an attempt to catch Prost, who was still pacing himself in conditions that were getting worse. By lap 26 of the scheduled 80 laps, the conditions became so bad that Prost signalled to Jacky Ickx, the clerk of the course to stop the race. By lap 26, Senna was up to second place, 11 seconds behind Prost, and Bellof 4th, but on lap 29, the race was stopped. Prost parked his car on the main straight, and Senna passed him. However, the rules said that when a race was stopped, the order would be determined by what the order was on the previous lap- and Prost was leading on that lap. The race was never restarted, so Prost won with Senna second. Drivers scored half-points, as the race had not completed 75% of the scheduled distance.

===Round 7: Canada===
The Canadian race at the public road Gilles Villeneuve circuit on a man-made island in the St. Lawrence River&#x27;s passageway through the center of Montreal was won by Nelson Piquet, who was finally able to actually finish a race this season after chronic unreliability with his Brabham. Piquet won ahead of Lauda and Prost; the latter had to deal a misfire in his TAG-Porsche turbocharged engine.

===Round 8: Detroit (USA)===

The first of two rounds in the United States was held on an angular street circuit in the Ford and General Motors home city of Detroit, Michigan. The race was moved 2 weeks forward to late June, suffering a considerable temperature difference. It was very hot come race-day, and the track — which was already unpopular with drivers and as it was to do in subsequent Grand Prix in Detroit — was largely broken up. Nelson Piquet took pole position again; every driver who obtained pole position that year was given a free Vespa motor scooter. Piquet set the record that year for most motor scooters collected among F1 drivers. The start of the Detroit Grand Prix saw an accident between Piquet and Mansell which blocked much of the start-finish straight; this race had to be abandoned and restarted. Typical of Detroit, the race proved to be a race of severe attrition: only 6 of the 26 cars finished.

Nelson Piquet won again on a circuit where engine power was not as important as other things, and Martin Brundle compounded this with his naturally aspirated engined Tyrrell: Detroit was one of the few circuits where his underpowered car could actually finish in the points and be competitive. Thanks to the immediate power response of the naturally aspirated Ford-Cosworth V8 DFY in the Tyrrell, compared to the delayed power response of the turbocharged engines (all of which had more than 200 more horsepower than the DFY in 1984), Brundle passed de Angelis in a Lotus for second, and was closing on Piquet on the last lap. The British driver finished 8 tenths of a second behind the Brazilian.

Soon after the podium ceremony, word arrived that the officials had found impurities in the water injection system on Brundle&#x27;s Tyrrell 012 and lead balls in the rubber bag containing the water. Samples of the water were shipped to France and Texas for analysis and found to contain significant levels of hydrocarbons. Team boss Ken Tyrrell was called to a meeting of the FISA Executive Committee on July 18 and, based on the impurities in the water, which had been topped up during a pit stop, was accused of refueling the car during the race. Refueling had been banned prior to the 1984 season and remained illegal until 1994. FISA found the team guilty and Tyrrell was disqualified from the remainder of the World Championship and lost the 13 points they had already gained as of Detroit. They were allowed to and did continue to race, but they were unable to score any championship points. Many in the paddock felt for Tyrrell as they believed the penalty far outweighed the crime and that FISA boss Jean-Marie Balestre had used the system to make an example of the British-based team to vindicate what happened the previous season, when Brabham escaped punishment after admitting to run a lighter car by using a different blend of fuel.

===Round 9: Dallas (USA)===

The Formula One circus moved some south to a whole new location in the United States (to which it would never return), for the Dallas Grand Prix at the Fair Park circuit in Dallas, Texas. This race effectively replaced the United States Grand Prix West in Long Beach, California, which was held in April and was taken over by CART IndyCar racing. This race had already been controversial for being held in the intense 38 °C (100 °F) average heat and humidity of a Texas July summer, and there were week-long rumors of its cancellation. Although the event organization itself (headed by racing legend Carroll Shelby) was praised and Dallas&#x27;s reception was thought to be welcoming and friendly, the time of year this race was scheduled made conditions extremely difficult. The concrete-wall lined circuit, located in a city district containing the Cotton Bowl some 10 kilometers outside of the center of Dallas measured what is possibly the highest track temperature ever recorded during a Grand Prix: 66 °C (151 °F). As a result, such extreme temperatures combined with the tyre and aerodynamic adhesion meant that the track almost completely disintegrated- the break up was so bad that the only parts of the track that were not covered with gravel were tire tracks left on the racing line. As a result, it was not only very slippery, but extremely bumpy as well. It was then decided to start the Grand Prix at 11:00 a.m. instead of the traditional time of 2:00 p.m. in an attempt to avoid the heat, which was scheduled to be 40 °C (104 °F) that day.

Nigel Mansell put his Lotus on pole position, the first of his career, with his teammate de Angelis alongside him in second. Martin Brundle yet again crashed severely and injured his ankles; he did not take part in the race. On race day, there was an American Trans-Am support race that left the track with huge holes in the track scattered everywhere. Shelby and the organizers were able to briefly fix these holes barely 45 minutes after the race was due to start, with Prost and Lauda leading protests to cancel the race.

As expected, the track broke up at the point that the cars had to line up behind each other even when right near each other to avoid the strewn gravel- which if the cars got on top of, they would slip and slide (with nearly the same effect as driving on ice) and most likely crash at the tight and extremely demanding Fair Park circuit. Mansell held off several challenges from Warwick, who got onto the marbles (strewn gravel) and crashed into a tire barrier- and also challenges from de Angelis, Prost, Lauda and Rosberg. Piquet was also catching this group and Arnoux, who had to start from the pit lane, passed several cars and was also closing on the leading group. Rosberg, who was running 2nd then forced Mansell into a mistake, and took the lead. Mansell had to go into the pits because of problems with his car; Prost took the lead from Rosberg, but eight laps later he clipped the wall and damaged his back right wheel. Rosberg, in his ill-handling Williams-Honda took advantage of Prost&#x27;s mistake and re-passed the Frenchman. Piquet hit the wall, and then retired due to a jammed accelerator pedal. There were consistent retirements throughout the entire race (all but 2 of the retirements were either accident or punctured-tire related; made worse by the close concrete walls), with the air and track temperatures rising and the track getting even worse. Prost then retired due to a puncture, as did Michele Alboreto and Lauda. Rosberg, equipped with a skull cap that kept him cool went on to win ahead of Arnoux and de Angelis.

Only 7 of the 26 cars entered finished the race, one more finisher than Detroit. Mansell, one lap down in 6th place, suffered gearbox failure right before the finish, deciding to push his broken black Lotus across the line in the Dallas heat in his black overalls. While doing this, he collapsed and fainted due to exhaustion. He was given 6th place because the 7th and 8th-place finishers were 2 laps behind Mansell.

Formula One would return to Texas 28 years later, but to the state capital city of Austin south of Dallas at a permanent circuit in November 2012.

===Race 10: Great Britain===
Formula One returned to Europe after the attrition-filled North American tour. The Brands Hatch circuit, just outside London in southeastern England, played host to this year&#x27;s British Grand Prix, alternating with Silverstone every two years.

During this time, the Tyrrell team had undergone a difficult period due to the fuel irregularities involving the re-filling of water tanks and the insertion of lead shot balls in the fuel tanks, in order to meet the minimum weight rules. In an unprecedented move that has not been repeated since, the FIA decided to ban the Tyrrell team from every future Grand Prix that season and strip the small English team of all its championship points on the grounds of cheating; team owner/operator Ken Tyrrell lost most of his sponsors between the Dallas and British Grands Prix.

Toleman driver and multiple motorcycle Grand Prix champion Johnny Cecotto crashed heavily at the fast Westfield corner hitting the barriers there head-on; the Venezuelan broke both his legs and never raced in Formula One again. Piquet again qualified on pole position, with Prost and Lauda 2nd and 3rd. This race was run as two parts: the first race saw a massive accident at the Bottom Bend left hand sweeping corner (otherwise known as Graham Hill corner); Riccardo Patrese (Alfa Romeo) tried to pass Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Williams-Honda, but spun attempting to do so. This caused his teammate Eddie Cheever to lift off, and behind him Johansson did the same but Philippe Alliot in the RAM-Hart did not have time to react and went into the back of the Tyrrell and then flew over it, landing on the rear of Cheever&#x27;s car. Also involved was Gartner who tried to avoid the crash and ended up in the tire barrier. The race went on, with Prost passing Piquet at the fearsome Paddock Hill bend; but this ended up not mattering because before the end of the lap, Jonathan Palmer had crashed the second RAM heavily at Clearways when the suspension failed. The car was parked beside the track and it was then decided that if it was left there, it could become a launch pad if another car went off the circuit. The race was stopped, and this meant that at the restart Piquet was on pole again as the order was based on the end of the 11th lap- much to the annoyance of Prost.

After the race restarted, Prost retired with gearbox failure, Piquet pitted and lost a lap on the leaders. So victory went to Niki Lauda. Warwick finished 2nd and Ayrton Senna finished 3rd in the Toleman, which was better suited to faster tracks with long corners like Brands Hatch than it was to slow and tight circuits.

===Race 11: Germany===
The very fast Hockenheim circuit in West Germany- the longest circuit of the year once again played host to the historic German Grand Prix. Surprisingly at this power circuit, Prost qualified his McLaren on pole position showing the benefits of a good car set up, and took the race victory ahead of Lauda and Warwick. Piquet retired yet again- this time with gearbox problems. The first part of the race saw a stirring drive from Senna- he was as high as 6th in his uncompetitive Toleman- but then his car&#x27;s rear wing failed and he spun off near the Ostkurve chicane.

===Race 12: Austria===
The Austrian Grand Prix, held at the Österreichring at Zeltweg near Graz since 1970, played host to the 15th Austrian Grand Prix and the 400th Formula One Grand Prix. The Österreichring was the fastest circuit of the year (this was the case when Silverstone was not on the calendar). Pole-sitter Piquet took the lead and led for most of the race distance. After the Renault engine in Elio de Angelis&#x27;s Lotus failed and littered the racing line at the very fast Jochen Rindt Kurve with slippery oil, the leaders Piquet and Prost came through- Piquet slipped and slid slightly through the corner- but Prost, while trying to hold 4th gear in place spun his car and crashed into the track-side Armco barrier. Lauda, who had passed 3rd placed Patrick Tambay coming out of the Bosch Kurve moved up into 2nd, and then began chasing Piquet; Lauda passed him going into the fastest corner on the track, the Tiroch Kurve. Piquet dropped back with ruined tires, and Lauda slowed down a lot after losing 4th gear in the Texaco Panorama curves. Lauda was able to stay in front of Piquet and become the only Austrian to win his home Grand Prix. Italian Michele Alboreto in a Ferrari finished 3rd.

===Race 13: Netherlands===
The spectacular beach-side Zandvoort circuit half an hour west of Amsterdam was the traditionally long-time host of the Dutch Grand Prix. This race was a McLaren 1–2 with Prost winning in front of Lauda with the Lotus duo Mansell and de Angelis finishing 3rd and 4th, respectively. It was at this race where McLaren secured the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship. The result also saw that only de Angelis had a mathematical chance of beating either Lauda or Prost to the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

===Race 14: Italy===
The Italian Grand Prix took place in early September at the Monza Autodrome near Milan. This race saw Prost retire after an updated spec. TAG-Porsche engine in his car failed early. Lauda, who was suffering the effects of a sore back, won from Italians Michele Alboreto and Riccardo Patrese who inherited the third place when his teammate Eddie Cheever ran out of fuel in his Alfa Romeo. This would prove to be the last F1 podium achieved by Alfa Romeo. Nelson Piquet led early before retiring with engine failure, while teammate Teo Fabi then led until he retired, also with a failed BMW engine. Patrick Tambay then took over the lead until he was passed by Lauda with the Renault retiring shortly after. Swedish driver Stefan Johansson stepped in to drive the Toleman of Ayrton Senna for this race after Toleman has suspended the Brazilian when it became known that he had signed to drive for Lotus from 1985. Johansson drove a steady race and capitalising on the retirements of others finished fourth, scoring his first World Championship points. Austrian drivers Jo Gartner and Gerhard Berger finished 5th and 6th for Osella and ATS respectively; however, as their teams had only entered one car for the season (Piercarlo Ghinzani and Manfred Winkelhock, respectively) and both were in second cars entered for the race neither received World Championship points.

===Race 15: Europe (Germany)===
Grands Prix in the Queens neighborhood of New York City and in the beachside resort town of Fuengirola, Spain had been cancelled; which left a month-long gap between the Italian and a replacement Grand Prix: the European Grand Prix, this year held at the all-new Nürburgring Grand Prix circuit, with state of the art safety facilities and paddock terraces. This new circuit replaced the old 22.8 km Nordschleife, which still exists today but in slightly shortened and bypassed form from the GP circuit.

As the race went on, there was an accident at the start involving Senna and Rosberg; both were out at the first corner; and Prost won this race unchallenged from Alboreto, pole-sitter Piquet and Lauda, who qualified 15th. This meant that Prost&#x27;s victory meant that he still stood a chance to win his first Drivers&#x27; Championship; Lauda led the points tally with 3.5 points.

===Race 16: Portugal===
The first Portuguese Grand Prix since 1960 was held at the updated Estoril circuit near the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. McLaren had claimed the Constructors&#x27; Championship in Italy, after winning 11 of the 15 races in the season, including the last 6 Grands Prix. Prost qualified 2nd alongside Piquet, who collected his 9th pole of the season, while Lauda was 11th on the grid. Lauda climbed up to 3rd after passing Ayrton Senna, who had qualified 3rd in a Toleman. Piquet had fallen away, so Prost was leading, with Nigel Mansell second in his last race for Lotus before moving to Williams. Mansell retired due to persistent brake problems, and Lauda moved up to second, ensuring his third World Championship. Prost won McLaren&#x27;s 7th consecutive victory and 12th of 16 races, whilst Lauda finished second, a mere half point in front of Prost in the championship, a record margin that has not been matched since. Senna completed the podium. As of 1984, Prost (future winner of four World Championships) had lost his 3rd consecutive F1 championship: he had been beaten by 2 points in 1983, and 7 points in 1982.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
# Half points awarded after race was stopped due to dangerous conditions.

===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. For the Drivers&#x27; Championship, the best eleven results were counted, while, for the Constructors&#x27; Championship, all rounds were counted.

No driver classified in more than eleven points-scoring positions, so no drop-rounds applied for this season. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===
;Notes:
 Half points were awarded at the Monaco Grand Prix as less than 75% of the scheduled distance was completed.&lt;br&gt;
* Neither Gartner nor Berger were eligible for points, as they were driving the respective &quot;second entries&quot; of Osella and ATS and both teams had officially entered only one car for the entire championship.

===World Constructors&#x27; Championship standings===
* On 18 July, prior to the British Grand Prix, Tyrrell were disqualified from the championship due to a technical infringement, which had been discovered at the Detroit Grand Prix. They continued racing under appeal but were ineligible to score points towards the championship. On 29 August, the FIA rejected the team&#x27;s appeal and banned them from the final three races of the season. The 13 points they had scored prior to the disqualification were subsequently reallocated.
* Half points were awarded at the Monaco Grand Prix as less than 75% of the scheduled distance was completed.

<text>The 1983 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 37th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1983 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1983 Formula One World Championship for Manufacturers, which were contested concurrently over a fifteen-race series that commenced on 13 March and ended on 15 October.

Nelson Piquet, driving for Brabham, won the Drivers&#x27; Championship, for the second time. Renault driver Alain Prost led the championship from the Belgian Grand Prix in May until the final race in South Africa, where he retired and enabled the Brazilian to snatch the title. It was the first title by a driver using a turbocharged engine and the last title by a Brabham driver.

Ferrari won the Constructors&#x27; Championship, despite its better driver, René Arnoux, finishing only third overall – a unique feat in Formula One history.

The season also included a non-championship Formula One race for the last time: the Race of Champions, held at Brands Hatch and won by defending World Champion Keke Rosberg.

==Drivers and constructors==
Avon exited as a tyre supplier after two seasons.

The following drivers and constructors contested the 1983 FIA Formula One World Championship.
===Team changes===
* Lotus would be without team founder Colin Chapman after the legendary team boss&#x27;s sudden death from a heart attack on 16 December 1982 at the age of 54. Chapman&#x27;s right-hand man Peter Warr took over as team manager.
* Fittipaldi closed its doors due to insufficient funds.
* Ensign was merged into the existing Theodore team.
* March Engineering had been building cars for RAM Racing from . From 1983 on, the chassis was labeled RAM and the March name was only seen in the official entry list.
* ATS switched from Ford-Cosworth V8&#x27;s in 1982 to BMW 1.5 litre turbo engines for this season. Likewise, Alfa Romeo traded their V12 engine for freshly developed V8 turbos called the 890T.
* Ligier lost their Talbot sponsorship and, with that, the use of the Matra V12&#x27;s. They managed to buy a supply of Cosworth V8 engines.

====Mid-season changes====

* There was a clear trend of manufacturers switching from naturally aspirated engines to turbocharged engines, attracted by their power output. Most teams were careful in their approach, running the old and new cars simultaneously, before finally stepping over to turbo.
** After the first race, Lotus left their Ford-Cosworth V8&#x27;s for Renault V6 turbos, the same as used by the factory Renault team.
** At the end of summer, McLaren went from Cosworth V8&#x27;s to Porsche V6 turbos, labeled after sponsor TAG.
** One race before the end, Williams switched from Cosworth V8&#x27;s to Honda V6 turbos.
* Osella, too, stopped using Cosworth V8&#x27;s, but then went a different way to their rivals: they bought one-year-old Alfa Romeo V12 engines.
* Spirit Racing debuted in Formula One with factory backing from Honda. They entered the 1982 European Formula Two Championship with Marlboro sponsorship and were immediately successful. Before the end of the year, they had developed a F1-ready chassis powered by a Honda turbo engine and begin a testing programme. The team&#x27;s first championship race was the British Grand Prix.

===Driver changes===

* After four years with Renault, René Arnoux was attracted by Manufacturers&#x27; Champion Ferrari, as teammate to Patrick Tambay. Renault then signed Eddie Cheever from Ligier.
* Meanwhile, the other Ligier driver, Jacques Laffite, had moved to Williams. So the French team had to find a new driver pair: Jean-Pierre Jarier from Osella and Raul Boesel from March.
* Another eight driver changes happened in the lower-ranking teams.

====Mid-season changes====
* During the season, RAM put four different drivers in their car.
* Alan Jones came out of retirement for a one-time drive with Arrows instead of their driver Chico Serra. The Brazilian was definitely replaced when sportscar driver Thierry Boutsen paid to make his F1 debut at his home race and was allowed to finish the season.
* After one enthusiastic attempt in with Shadow, Stefan Johansson made his racing debut with Spirit, having driven for the team in Formula Two.
* As a &#x27;thank you&#x27; from Williams&#x27;s team leaders, Jonathan Palmer made his F1 debut in a third Williams car during his home race at Brands Hatch.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
Although the provisional calendar showed 18 Grands Prix, 15 were confirmed, one less than the year before.
* The South African Grand Prix was moved from season opener to be the season finale.
* The French Grand Prix was moved up from July to April.
* The Belgian Grand Prix was held at Spa-Francorchamps instead of Circuit Zolder, as part of an agreement to alternate between the venues, and moved back on the schedule, after the Monaco Grand Prix. In similar fashion, this year&#x27;s British Grand Prix was held at Silverstone instead of Brands Hatch. The latter venue stayed on the calendar under the guise of the European Grand Prix.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was moved back from early July to the end of August.
* The Swiss Grand Prix at Dijon-Prenois and Caesars Palace Grand Prix in Las Vegas were removed from the calendar.

====Provisional calendar====
* Organisers had been trying to let the Argentine Grand Prix return since . The race was scheduled for 30 January, but was later cancelled.
* Plans were made to host the Grand Prix of the Soviet Union in Moscow on 21 August, but these plans fell through due to bureaucratic barriers.
* A Grand Prix in New York City, to be held on a temporary circuit at Flushing Meadows in Queens, was scheduled for 25 September, but after certain problems, the event was cancelled and replaced by the European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch.

==Regulation changes==
* A major change in technical regulations mandated a flat undertray for the cars, with a complete ban on the ground effect technology pioneered by the Lotus 78 in . This was done to reduce downforce and cornering speeds, which were deemed to have reached dangerous levels in , a season in which several violent and fatal accidents occurred.
* Four-wheel drive was banned, as well as cars with more than four wheels.
* The minimum weight was set at .
* The red light at the back of the car should have a power of at least 21W.

==Season report==

===Early season===
====Race 1: Brazil====
The South African Grand Prix which had started the 1982 season had been moved to the end of the year, and so the season began in Brazil. At the Jacarepagua Riocentro Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro, defending champion Keke Rosberg took pole position, but lost the lead early on to Nelson Piquet and then caught fire during his pitstop. With the fire extinguished, he fought back from ninth to finish second behind Piquet, but was subsequently disqualified for receiving a push start in the pits. This left an unprecedented situation, as the organisers decided not to award second to Niki Lauda, who finished third, but to leave the position vacant. As such, only five drivers scored points, and other than Piquet and Lauda, these were Rosberg&#x27;s teammate Jacques Laffite, whose presence in fourth was a surprise given his 18th place grid slot. Ferrari had a difficult race and had a best finish of only fifth with Patrick Tambay, who had started third. The final point went to Marc Surer, who had qualified 20th but moved up to 14th by the end of the first lap.

====Race 2: United States West====
The next race was the first of two to be held in the US, the United States Grand Prix West, held at Long Beach, California. Tambay started the race from pole, and led until lap 25. On that lap, Rosberg attempted to overtake, but the two cars touched and span. Tambay retired, but Rosberg continued in the lead. Soon afterwards, Laffite took the lead, pushing Rosberg into a collision as he did so. The McLaren pair of John Watson and Niki Lauda had started from 22nd and 23rd on the grid, but both Laffite and Patrese were struggling with worn tyres, and were being caught quickly by the McLarens. Patrese attempted to pass Laffite on lap 44 but slid wide, and was passed by both McLarens. They also both found a way past Laffite on the next lap. From there Watson was left to lead home his teammate for a 1–2 victory, and one that still stands as the victory from the lowest qualifying position. Patrese suffered an engine failure three laps from the end, leaving third position to Arnoux, with Laffite following home, a lap down in fourth. The points were rounded out by Surer in the Arrows and Johnny Cecotto in the Theodore. Chico Serra had been replaced in the second Arrows by 1980 World Champion Alan Jones, but the Australian&#x27;s return to F1 was unsuccessful, and Serra would be back in the car for the next race.

This was the last United States Grand Prix West, as race organiser Chris Pook had decided that Formula One was too expensive. From 1984 onwards, the race would instead be part of the CART IndyCar series.

===European spring===
As the F1 circus headed to Europe, Lauda led the championship despite not having yet won a race. The two winners, Piquet and Watson, were joint second, just one point behind. This meant that McLaren held a commanding lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, ten points ahead of Brabham.

====Race 3: France====
For the French Grand Prix at the Circuit Paul Ricard near Marseille, the RAM team entered a second car for local driver Jean-Louis Schlesser, who failed to qualify.

This race was being held in mid-April instead of its usual late June/early July date, in order to avoid the southern French summer heat. The race was dominated by another home driver, Alain Prost. He took pole position, victory and fastest lap and led all but three laps of the race. These three were led by Piquet during the pit stops; the Brazilian eventually finished second to reclaim his championship lead. Eddie Cheever came home third in the second Renault. Tambay was fourth in front of his home crowd, with the two Williams of Rosberg and Laffite fifth and sixth respectively.

Piquet now led the championship by five points from Lauda, with Watson and Prost just one further point behind. McLaren&#x27;s lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship had been severely narrowed by their failure to score, and Brabham were now just four points behind, with Renault also in close attendance.

====Race 4: San Marino====
Arnoux on Ferrari took the pole position, while his teammate Tambay surged up from the second row to join him at the head of the pack in the opening laps. Local driver Riccardo Patrese, however, overcame them both to put his Brabham in the lead. Despite the best efforts of first Arnoux and then Tambay after they swapped places during the pitstops, he stayed there. On lap 34, Tambay finally found a way past, and he remained in the lead until a small misfire allowed Patrese to take the lead 6 laps from the end on the approach to Tosa. However, on the exit to Aqua Minerale Patrese ran wide and ran into the tyre wall. This allowed Tambay to retake the lead and take the chequered flag, giving Ferrari a win on home ground. Prost passed Arnoux in the last five laps to prevent a Ferrari 1–2 finish. Arnoux came home third, however, to make it an all-French podium, leading home the last points scorers: Rosberg, Watson and Surer yet again. Piquet&#x27;s failure to score due to an engine failure, a common occurrence for the Brabham-BMWs, meant that he and Prost were now tied at the top of the standings with Tambay only one point behind. The McLaren pair of Watson and Lauda were also in close attendance. Ferrari seized the lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, but were only separated from McLaren and Renault by a total of three points. Brabham&#x27;s inconsistency saw them slip to fourth, some way behind.

====Race 5: Monaco====
Prost took his second pole of the year in Monaco. Arnoux completed an all French front row. However, both were passed at the start by Keke Rosberg who, despite the damp track, took the gamble of starting on slicks while those around him were either on full wets or intermediate tyres, and as Prost dropped back through the field after a few laps the Finn was left with no serious challengers. Despite the rain, and multiple collisions further down the field, including Arnoux, Rosberg led every lap to record his first victory of the year. Jacques Laffite had looked set to record a Williams 1–2, but he was stopped by a gearbox failure. This gave the two remaining podium spots to Piquet and Prost, allowing Piquet to open up a two-point lead in the championship. Tambay was fourth, ahead of Danny Sullivan&#x27;s Tyrrell and Mauro Baldi&#x27;s Alfa Romeo. Patrese suffered from an electrics problem ten laps from home.

Prost remained second in the championship, with Tambay only two further points behind. Rosberg&#x27;s victory moved him up to fourth, while Ferrari retained their lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, two points ahead of Renault, who were, in turn, two points ahead of Brabham, McLaren and Williams, all on 21.

====Race 6: Belgium====
The 1983 race was, for Spa-Francorchamps circuit in southern Belgium, the first time it had hosted a Grand Prix since 1970; although the circuit had been shortened in 1979 to 7 km from 14 km, and had been made a lot safer than its extremely fast original version but had still managed to retain the fast, flowing nature of the old circuit. Zolder and Nivelles had hosted the Belgian Grand Prix for most of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Prost took pole yet again at Spa for the Belgian Grand Prix, although his qualifying performances were not reflected in his points tally at that point in the season. Andrea de Cesaris leapt into the lead from the second row of the grid, and spent the first twenty laps pulling away from Prost. The Italian looked set for a maiden victory before a slow pit stop dropped him to second and engine trouble slowed and finally stopped his Alfa Romeo. This left Prost free to record a victory only briefly challenged by Piquet, who slipped away at the end to fourth. Tambay was second with Cheever third, making it two Renaults on the podium again, while Rosberg and Laffite rounded out the points, their Cosworth powered cars proving no match for the turbo&#x27;s on the fast Spa layout.

Prost had a four-point lead over Piquet, with Tambay only one further point behind. Renault also assumed the lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship by five points from Ferrari, with Brabham, Williams and McLaren slipping farther behind. Arrows, seemingly determined to get rid of Chico Serra, replaced him for a second time, this time with local rookie Thierry Boutsen. The Belgian, more known at that point for driving sportscars, kept his drive for the rest of the season.

===North American tour===
====Race 7: Detroit====
The teams then travelled to Detroit for their customary mid-season visit to North America. The Detroit street circuit had been changed slightly from the previous year&#x27;s race; a hairpin on Jefferson Avenue and Chrysler Drive had been bypassed and eliminated, so that the course stayed on Chrysler Drive up until it turned left onto Congress Street.

Arnoux scored his second pole of the year, but Piquet took the lead at the start. Arnoux retook the lead on lap 9, and held off both Piquet and Rosberg until the electrics failed on his Ferrari, leaving Piquet back in the lead again. Michele Alboreto&#x27;s Tyrrell inherited Piquet&#x27;s lead when the Brazilian developed a slow rear puncture, dropping him to fourth. This was Alboreto&#x27;s second career victory, both of which had come in the United States. Rosberg came home second with Watson third, while Piquet recovered to finish fourth. Laffite was fifth and Nigel Mansell came home 6th to score Lotus&#x27;s first point of 1983. Prost&#x27;s failure to score left him just one point ahead of Piquet with Tambay and Rosberg both in close attendance. Renault&#x27;s lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship was reduced to four points, with Williams moving into second, one point ahead of Ferrari.

====Race 8: Canada====
The Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal a week after Detroit saw the debut of Jacques Villeneuve, brother of the late Gilles Villeneuve. He was given a debut by RAM at his home Grand Prix, replacing Eliseo Salazar. He failed to qualify for the race. Arnoux took pole again and led for most of the race, his lead only being surrendered during the pit stops. He became the year&#x27;s seventh victor in eight races as he won for Ferrari for the first time. Patrese had looked set for second before yet another technical failure, this time a gearbox failure, saw him continue to fail to score points in 1983. This left Cheever free to come home second, his best result of the year, with Tambay putting the second Ferrari on the podium in third place. Rosberg, Prost and Watson rounded out the points. Prost held on to his championship lead, now just three points, with Tambay and Piquet joint second. Rosberg was just two farther points behind. Renault and Ferrari now held a joint lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with Williams, Brabham and McLaren all slipping off the pace.

===European summer===
====Race 9: Britain====
The teams returned to Europe for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the fastest circuit of the year. Although Salazar had been expected to return to the RAM in place of Villeneuve, British driver Kenny Acheson was hired instead. He performed well enough to retain the seat for the rest of the season. The race also saw the debut of the Honda-funded Spirit team. The team would run a limited programme in 1983 with a view to running a full season in 1984. Stefan Johansson would drive the car. For qualifying Arnoux took his third successive pole position in the brand new Ferrari 126C3. He lost the lead to his teammate Tambay at the start and held second ahead of Prost. Although the Ferraris had a straight-line speed advantage over the Renault, overall Prost was the fastest of the three, and he passed both Arnoux and Tambay by lap 20. But for pit stops, he remained in the lead until the finish. Piquet also overcame the Ferraris before the end to finish second, with Tambay in third. Mansell, with Renault turbo power for the first time in his Lotus, took his best result of the year to be the highest home driver in fourth ahead of Arnoux and Lauda. This allowed both Prost and Renault to extend their championship leads. Piquet was now six points behind, with Tambay two points further back. Rosberg was now more than a victory behind and it was clear that teams without turbo power such as Williams, McLaren, Tyrrell and Ligier were at a significant disadvantage. The Constructors&#x27; Championship was becoming a two-horse race, with Renault leading Ferrari by three points.

====Race 10: West Germany====
The next race was the German Grand Prix at the very fast Hockenheim circuit near Stuttgart, and Tambay secured Ferrari&#x27;s fourth consecutive pole position. He lost the lead to Arnoux early on, however, and later suffered an engine failure to promote Piquet to second. The Brazilian inherited the lead briefly during Arnoux&#x27;s pit stop, but the Frenchman could not be stopped and recorded his second victory of the year. A fire three laps from home prevented Piquet from picking up second, which instead went to Andrea de Cesaris, collecting some points for Alfa Romeo. Patrese was third, scoring his first points of the year ahead of Prost, Lauda and Watson.

Prost extended his points lead to nine points over Piquet, but both Tambay and Arnoux were nearing. Ferrari also reassumed their points lead, three ahead of Renault.

====Race 11: Austria====
It was another pole for Tambay and Ferrari in Austria at the fast Österreichring circuit near Graz. He led until the first pit stops, when low oil pressure forced his retirement. This should have allowed teammate Arnoux to pick up the victory, but he was passed by Prost in the closing stages. Piquet finished third with Cheever fourth, Mansell fifth and Lauda rounding out the points. Prost now held a 14-point lead over Piquet, 51 points to 37, with Arnoux on 34 and Tambay on 31. Renault went back into the lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship, three points ahead of Ferrari.

====Race 12: Netherlands====
Piquet took his first pole of the season at the Dutch Grand Prix at the Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam, and led until lap 41, when Prost attempted to pass him. The two collided, and both were out on the spot. This left Arnoux to take victory for Ferrari, which turned into a 1–2 when Patrese suffered a problem near the end which dropped him to an eventual 9th. John Watson was third. A race of high attrition allowed for an unusual top six, with Derek Warwick, Mauro Baldi and Michele Alboreto rounding out the points. Johansson came home 7th for the new Spirit team. Arnoux now moved into second in the championship, eight points behind Prost. Tambay and Piquet were now joint third, 14 points behind the leader. Ferrari&#x27;s lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, however, was now 12 points over Renault. Piquet&#x27;s pole ended a run of ten consecutive pole positions by French drivers. This race saw McLaren join the turbo ranks when Lauda debuted the new TAG V6 engine, though Watson still drove the Cosworth-powered car.

====Race 13: Italy====
With three races left to run, the teams headed to Italy in early September. The Monza Autodrome near Milan, saw the Ferrari lose pole to Patrese, placing second and third. Piquet jumped both Ferraris to run second behind his teammate in the opening laps, but it did not last long, as electric problems forced Patrese to retire on lap 3. Piquet was then unchallenged for the rest of the race, and came home to record his first victory since the opening race in Brazil, some six months before. Arnoux took second with Cheever third and Tambay fourth. Elio de Angelis scored his first points of the year with fifth, with Derek Warwick scoring points for the second time in a row in sixth. The performances of Piquet and Arnoux, coupled with Prost&#x27;s failure to score, left the championship in an uncertain position with two races left. Prost still led with 51, Arnoux had 49, Piquet 46 and Tambay 40 with 18 points left on the board. Ferrari maintained their lead, now with 17 points back to Renault.

====Race 14: Europe (Brands Hatch, UK)====
A third Grand Prix in the United States was supposed to be held at the Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in the New York City borough of Queens, but was canceled at short notice due to local protests. The British Brands Hatch circuit, just outside London, was able to organise a European Grand Prix in its place. Theodore travelled to the race with just one car, having insufficient funds for Johnny Cecotto to compete in the last two races. After the race, the team folded completely, and did not appear at all at the last race. The Spirit team also announced they would not travel to the last race, in preparation for their first full season in 1984. Williams had run a third car in the Brands Hatch race, for Jonathan Palmer. The British driver finished 13th, the only Williams to finish after Rosberg retired with an engine failure and Laffite failed to qualify.

The race saw de Angelis take the pole position for Lotus. The Italian was overtaken at the start by compatriot Patrese, who led until the first pit stops. After this, he slipped away from the pace, and an engine failure for de Angelis gave the lead to Piquet. He led until the finish, becoming the first driver all season to win two consecutive races. Prost fought through for second, with Mansell taking Lotus&#x27;s first podium of the year with third. De Cesaris was fourth, while Toleman had both cars in the points, with Warwick ahead of Bruno Giacomelli.

The race left both championships in the balance with one race left. Prost still led, but now by only two points above Piquet. Arnoux could also be champion, but it would require him to win with Prost not scoring and Piquet no higher than fifth. Renault were still 11 points behind Ferrari.

===Season finale: South Africa===
The season finale was the South African Grand Prix at the fast, high-altitude Kyalami circuit between Johannesburg and Pretoria. Tambay took pole with Piquet, the best-positioned of the title contenders, in second. Arnoux was fourth with Prost fifth. If the race finished like that, Piquet would be champion. Piquet assumed the lead at the start to further enhance his chances. Prost fought his way up to third, while an early engine failure for Arnoux put him out of the running. With Prost in third and Patrese in second, Piquet&#x27;s teammate kept Prost behind him. However, when Prost&#x27;s turbo failed on lap 44, Piquet needed only to finish in the top four. He backed off, and eventually surrendered the lead to Patrese, who became the season&#x27;s eighth winner. Piquet also allowed Lauda through into second place, but the Austrian&#x27;s electrics failed three laps later. De Cesaris also passed Piquet before the end, securing his second podium of the year for Alfa Romeo. Third for Piquet was enough to secure him his second world championship, while Warwick once again finished in the points for Toleman in fourth. Rosberg and Cheever rounded out the points. Only two points separated Piquet and Prost at the end, the Frenchman having led in the title race for most of the season. Renault also lost the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with Ferrari securing the title for the second year in succession.

<doc id="1140076" wikidata="Q69548" url="?curid=1140076" title="1982 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 1982 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 36th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It included two competitions run over the course of the year, the 33rd Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 25th Formula One World Championship for Constructors. The season featured sixteen rounds between 23 January and 25 September. The Drivers&#x27; Championship was won by Keke Rosberg and the Constructors&#x27; Championship by Scuderia Ferrari.

The Championship started with a drivers&#x27; strike at the season opener in South Africa and saw a partial race boycott as part of the ongoing FISA–FOCA war at the San Marino Grand Prix. Two drivers died during 1982: Gilles Villeneuve during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix and Riccardo Paletti at the start of the Canadian Grand Prix. Championship front-runner Didier Pironi also suffered a career-ending accident while qualifying for the German Grand Prix. These incidents and several other major accidents led to regulation changes to increase driver safety for the 1983 season. Motorsport journalist Nigel Roebuck later wrote that 1982 was &quot;an ugly year, pock-marked by tragedy, by dissension, by greed, and yet, paradoxically, it produced some of the most memorable racing ever seen&quot;.

Eventual champion Rosberg won only one race all season – the Swiss Grand Prix – but consistency gave him the Drivers&#x27; Championship, five points clear of Pironi and John Watson. Rosberg was the second driver to win the championship having won only one race in the season, after Mike Hawthorn in . Eleven different drivers from seven different teams won a race during the season, with no driver winning more than twice; there was also a run of nine different winners in nine consecutive races from the Monaco Grand Prix to the Swiss Grand Prix. Ferrari, who replaced Villeneuve with Patrick Tambay and Pironi with World Champion Mario Andretti, managed to score enough points to secure the Constructors&#x27; Championship, finishing five points clear of McLaren with Renault third.

== Drivers and constructors ==
The following teams and drivers took part in the 1982 Formula One World Championship:
=== Team changes ===
All teams and constructors who had competed in returned for the new season. Brabham had entered an engine supply deal with German car manufacturer BMW for the use of their inline-four turbo engines. The team announced in January that they were committing to the use of the new BMW engine throughout the season, but after experiencing reliability problems with it, they reverted to the Cosworth DFV motor several times during the season.

=== Driver changes ===

At the end of the 1981 season, both Williams drivers, World Champion Alan Jones and Carlos Reutemann, had announced their retirement from racing. Reutemann did in fact return for 1982, competing in the first two races, before retiring unexpectedly at the end of March. Jones was replaced by Keke Rosberg, who had previously entered 36 Grands Prix, with a third-place finish as his best result.

The off season saw rumours of several former champions returning to the sport, but in the end only double World Champion Niki Lauda returned to Formula One after an absence of two years to partner John Watson at McLaren. Ferrari and Renault retained their race-winning line-ups of Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi and Alain Prost and René Arnoux, respectively. At Brabham, defending World Champion Nelson Piquet remained with the team, and was partnered by Riccardo Patrese, who moved from Arrows to replace Héctor Rebaque.

The Osella team gave Riccardo Paletti his Grand Prix debut, while Toleman replaced Brian Henton with Teo Fabi, also a newcomer to Formula One. Marc Surer was hired by Arrows, but broke both his feet in pre-season testing at Kyalami. He was set to be replaced by Patrick Tambay, who was then fired after taking part in the drivers&#x27; strike at that race and the seat went to Henton. Eliseo Salazar transferred from Ensign Racing to the ATS team.
;Mid-season changes
Following Reutemann&#x27;s retirement, Williams hired World Champion Mario Andretti as a one-off replacement for the United States Grand Prix West. Derek Daly then became the permanent second driver at the team, as Andretti had racing obligations in the United States to fulfill. Andretti returned with Ferrari for the last two races of the season, replacing Pironi, who had suffered career-ending injuries at the German Grand Prix. Villeneuve, who died following a crash in qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, was replaced by Tambay starting from the Dutch Grand Prix.

At Team Lotus, Nigel Mansell missed two races due to injuries from a crash in Canada. His substitute at the Dutch Grand Prix was Roberto Moreno, who failed to qualify. Mansell attempted a comeback at Brands Hatch, but was again replaced at the French Grand Prix, this time by Geoff Lees. An accident at the race in France led Jochen Mass, already deeply shaken by the fatal crash of Villeneuve, in which he was involved, to walk away from Grand Prix racing. He was replaced at March by Rupert Keegan. Swedish driver Slim Borgudd had moved from ATS to Tyrrell in the off season, but was forced to leave the team after only three races when his sponsorship money ran out. Henton took his place from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards, as Surer returned to Arrows after his injuries had healed.

== Calendar ==

The following rounds were included on the provisional calendars but were cancelled:

The Australian Grand Prix was a reserve race to be held in Ravenhall on the outskirts of Melbourne, with a date of 3 October.

=== Calendar changes ===
The Argentine Grand Prix was scheduled to take place on 7 March, but was cancelled due to lack of sponsors, as several pulled out due to uncertainty following the drivers&#x27; strike in the opening race. The Grand Prix was also cancelled due to political unrest in Argentina.

The Spanish Grand Prix was omitted from the calendar for several reasons. The Circuito del Jarama, where the race had been held the previous year, was unpopular with the drivers. In addition, the organisers had failed to pay their fees for 1981. Although the race was re-instated for 27 June after the organisers had paid off their debts to the Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association (FOCA), protests from the teams over the dangerous nature, the very narrow track, and outdated facilities of the Jarama venue led to the race being cancelled.

Two new races were added to the calendar compared to 1981: the Detroit Grand Prix and the Swiss Grand Prix, the latter to be held at Dijon-Prenois in France since motor racing has been outlawed in Switzerland since the 1955 Le Mans disaster. The addition of Detroit meant that the United States hosted three Grands Prix, the only time one country had more than two races in one season until 2020, when Italy also hosted three Grands Prix.

== Background ==
=== Politics ===

Starting in the early 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone, owner of the Brabham team, had seized control of the Formula 1 Constructors Association, later renamed Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association. In this role, he began to negotiate more lucrative contracts between the teams and the track owners, including obtaining full control over television rights for FOCA. Realising the growing influence of Ecclestone and FOCA, the sport&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) and its head, Paul Metternich, instated Frenchman Jean-Marie Balestre as the head of the Commission Sportive Internationale in 1978, which was then renamed to Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA). FIA delegated running of the sporting regulations governing Formula One to FISA.

Over the following years, a power struggle developed between FOCA and FISA and Ecclestone and Balestre in particular. This conflict is generally referred to as the FISA–FOCA war. FOCA consisted of the majorly British constructor teams, while the manufacturer or &quot;works&quot; teams (Renault, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Talbot-Ligier), together with Osella and Toleman were aligned with FISA.

The conflict came to a head at the 1980 Spanish Grand Prix, where the drivers of teams belonging to FOCA boycotted the obligatory drivers&#x27; briefing and were threatened by FISA with having their licences revoked. The race went ahead as a non-championship event, without the non-FOCA aligned teams participating.

Following an aborted attempt to establish a breakaway World Championship, FOCA agreed to the Concorde Agreement with FISA in March 1981. This agreement stipulated that all teams were obliged to attend all rounds of the championship, while at the same time settling differences over future regulation changes.

=== Regulation changes and technological development ===
==== Sporting regulations ====
The new rules for the 1982 season included an increase in the number of cars permitted to enter a Grand Prix from 30 to 34, and the number of starters from 24 to 26. To avoid having all 34 cars on the track at one time, a pre-qualifying session was introduced in which the three teams with the worst record in the previous year would compete to be allowed into qualification proper. Just as the previous year, the best eleven results from all the races counted towards the Drivers&#x27; Championship. All races counted towards the Manufacturers Championship.

==== Technology ====
In the years leading up to 1982, two major technological developments had shaped Formula One: the turbocharged engine and &quot;ground effect&quot;. In , Lotus had revolutionised aerodynamics in Formula One by introducing the Lotus 78, known as the &quot;wing car&quot;. The car used what is commonly referred to as &quot;ground effect&quot;, with the physical principle applied being the &quot;Venturi effect&quot;. The sides of the underside of the car would be shut off with skirts to trap the under-pressure airflow underneath the car, effectively &quot;sucking&quot; the vehicle to the ground. This led to increased cornering speeds, but at the same time brought implications that had an adverse effect on the drivers&#x27; safety. Moveable skirts were thus banned in 1981, accompanied by a minimum ride height for the cars of , targeted at minimising the &quot;ground effect&quot; and to reduce cornering speed.

For 1982, both regulations were reversed as a result of the new Concorde Agreement. The skirts around the underpart of the chassis, which locked the airflow underneath the car, necessitated very stiff suspensions to work properly. This meant that every bump on track was putting enormous strain on the drivers, shaking them around in the cockpit. Additionally, the cornering speed and the resulting high g-forces put pressure on both the drivers and the cars&#x27; suspensions, making them prone to breaking. The cars would also move up and down on the road, in an effect called &quot;porpoising&quot;, making the cars very hard to control. These adverse effects were particularly impactful at bumpy circuits, such as Jacarepaguá, where Riccardo Patrese retired due to exhaustion. Other drivers reported dizziness and blurred vision.

The potentially dangerous implications of &quot;ground effect&quot; were only worsened by the advent of very powerful turbocharged engines. In 1977, Renault had introduced the first turbocharged engine into the sport with their Renault RS01. The regulations at the time allowed for either three-litre normally aspirated or 1.5-litre turbocharged engines, with Renault being the first to attempt to go the latter route. Over the next few seasons, the turbo engines proved fast, yet unreliable. The cars also suffered from an effect often labelled &quot;turbo lag&quot;, meaning that a significant and indeterminable time gap existed between applying the throttle of the car and the point when the full power of the turbo was taking effect. This made the turbo cars very difficult to drive. In , Renault took the first victory with a turbo-charged engine. In 1981, Ferrari had followed them by introducing their own turbo engine. Additionally, the Toleman team also used turbo engines for 1982, supplied by Hart, while Brabham started using turbocharged BMW engines at some, but not all, rounds that year.

Alfa Romeo retained what motorsport writer Doug Nye called the most powerful three-litre engine seen in Formula One at that time, with . They tested their turbocharged V8 engine during practice for the Italian Grand Prix, but did not race with it until . Most FOCA teams still relied upon the Cosworth DFV engine, which had been introduced by Lotus in .

In 1981, McLaren had built the first monocoque car from carbon fibre composite. This resulted in lighter cars, while at the same time being more rigid. McLaren had proven that carbon-fibre cars could be quick, with John Watson winning the 1981 British Grand Prix. Watson&#x27;s lack of severe injuries following a severe accident at that year&#x27;s Italian Grand Prix had shown the superiority of the material in terms of safety. Lotus followed suit for 1982, introducing carbon fibre for their Lotus 91.

Even with these effective technical advances in chassis design, the FOCA teams with a Cosworth DFV motor had a significant power disadvantage compared to the constructors who used a turbocharged engine. To counteract this, the non-turbo teams used a loophole in the regulations. The weight of the car was measured before and after the race, with oil and cooling liquids allowed to be refilled before the final weigh-in. The teams would therefore build their cars lighter than allowed by the regulations and added water tanks, which they claimed were used to cool brake temperatures, but in reality the water was dumped on the track as soon as the car left the pitlane, allowing them to run faster. Keke Rosberg later explained that &quot;the water tank [...] was the one that gave us at least a theoretical chance to compete with the turbos.&quot; In other regulation changes, the minimum weight of the cars was reduced from to . A new &quot;driver survival cell&quot; cockpit protection was made mandatory as well.

Four companies, Goodyear, Michelin, Pirelli, and Avon, supplied tyres, including special qualifying tyres with an increased grip level. These qualifying tyres had originally been banned in , but had since been reallowed. For the first time the number of tyres permitted for qualification was limited to two sets per session, creating a situation which Villeneuve thought &quot;...unnecessarily dangerous. If I have only two chances to set a time, I need a clear track, OK? If it isn&#x27;t clear, if there&#x27;s someone in my way, I just have to hope he&#x27;s looking in his mirrors – I mean, I can&#x27;t lift, because this is my last chance.&quot; The necessity of having a clear track to make the most of the short-lasting qualifying tyres led to drivers taking risks, further increasing the danger.

== Season report ==
=== Pre-season ===
The week before the first Grand Prix weekend of the season in South Africa, teams gathered for a test session which was conducted at the Kyalami circuit. Prost set the fastest time during testing, at 1:05.71, almost eight seconds quicker than the previous track record. Surer, driving for the Arrows team, broke his feet in an accident and had to be replaced by Tambay. Mass also crashed in his March 821, but escaped uninjured. Ferrari did not have their new car, the 126C2, ready for testing and ran an updated version of their 1981 vehicle, the 126CK, instead. The Brabham team were satisfied with the progress of their new BT50 with the turbocharged BMW engine.

=== Championship ===
==== Opening rounds ====

Before the start of the season, all drivers had received a letter from FISA, containing an application form for a new Super Licence. This new document stated that drivers would not be allowed to switch teams freely during the course of the season, with their licence being withdrawn should they do so. Additionally, the document forbade drivers from actions &quot;which might harm the moral or material interests&quot; of Formula One. The returning Lauda was displeased by this and communicated with Pironi, head of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA). They contacted other drivers and ultimately, six drivers refused to sign the document, those being Lauda, Pironi, Villeneuve, Arnoux, Bruno Giacomelli and Andrea de Cesaris.
On the Wednesday between testing and the first practice session of the South African Grand Prix, during a meeting of the Formula One Commission, Pironi, on behalf of the drivers, objected to the licence application. Balestre reacted strongly, excluding all drivers who had not signed from the following day&#x27;s practice session. The drivers, almost all of them and not just the ones who had refused to sign, in turn reacted by going on strike the next day, boarding a bus to a nearby hotel. The conflict continued until the next day, the Friday before the race was set to take place. It was partially resolved shortly before noon that day, with the drivers receiving half-hearted assurances towards their demands. They would ultimately be fined $5,000 each for the strike, with the new Super Licence being scrapped. Following the events in South Africa, the GPDA disbanded at a driver meeting in Paris, being replaced by the Professional Racing Drivers&#x27; Association (PRDA).

When qualifying finally commenced, Arnoux took pole position from Piquet, with Villeneuve and Patrese on the second row of the grid. At the start, Arnoux led while Piquet did not get away well and was overtaken by several cars, including Prost, who jumped from fifth to second. Piquet and Villeneuve retired early, while Prost took the lead from his teammate Arnoux on lap 14. He would lead until lap 41, when he punctured his left rear tyre, forcing him to come into the pitlane for new tyres. He emerged in eighth place, but with this fresh set, Prost was the quickest driver on the course, allowing him to overtake relatively easily. On lap 68, he once again took the leading position from Arnoux and went on to win the race. Reutemann also overtook Arnoux late in the race and finished second, with Lauda in fourth place on his return to Formula One racing.

The teams then travelled to Brazil for the second round. Brabham abandoned their turbo-charged BT50 for the time being on grounds of its unreliability, reverting to an updated BT49D for this race, powered by the Cosworth DFV engine. The cars once again proved just how quick they had become, when Prost qualified on pole position 6.27 seconds faster than Piquet had done the year before. Villeneuve was second on the grid and went into the lead at the start, followed by Rosberg, with the two Renault drivers behind. Rosberg fell behind the Renaults on the first lap and was overtaken by Patrese on lap three and by Piquet two laps later. Villeneuve led until lap 30, when he spun out. This allowed Piquet into the lead, closely followed by Rosberg, with the two having battled for position during the preceding laps. The order remained to the finish, with Piquet winning from Rosberg, Prost, Watson and Mansell.

The heavy strain posed onto the drivers by the bumpy circuit and hot, humid weather was showcased not only by Patrese retiring on lap 34 due to exhaustion, but also when Piquet fainted on the winners&#x27; rostrum. Following the race, both Ferrari and Renault protested the first- and second-place finishes of Piquet and Rosberg, citing the water tanks used by Brabham and Williams to be illegal. The case was taken to FISA in Paris, with no outcome until after the next race.

The third race of the season took place at the street circuit in Long Beach. During Saturday&#x27;s qualifying, Lauda did just one run of a few laps, setting a fast time that put him on top of the leaderboard. In the closing seconds of the session, de Cesaris bettered Lauda&#x27;s time, clinching pole position for Alfa Romeo. De Cesaris had been ousted by McLaren for Lauda over the winter and was moved to tears by his accomplishment.

De Cesaris led from the start, while Lauda was overtaken by Arnoux for second place. On lap six, Giacomelli, running fourth, tried to outbrake Lauda and in the process hit Arnoux, forcing both to retire. This allowed Villeneuve into third place, ahead of Watson. Pironi and Prost both retired after hitting the wall on laps seven and eleven respectively. On lap 15, Lauda took advantage of de Cesaris missing a gear change and moved into the lead, immediately beginning to pull away. Rosberg overtook Villeneuve for third on lap 21. This turned into second place on lap 34, when de Cesaris crashed into the wall after his engine had failed. The order remained until the chequered flag, with Lauda winning in only his third Grand Prix back in the sport. Villeneuve was later excluded from the results in Long Beach, following a protest by Ken Tyrrell over Ferrari&#x27;s use of a double rear wing.

==== First European rounds ====
In the week before the next round, the San Marino Grand Prix, the FIA International Court of Appeal sided with Ferrari and Renault on their complaint over the water tanks at the race in Brazil and disqualified Piquet and Rosberg, handing victory to Prost. It was further decided that the cars would now be weighed after the race in the condition in which they had finished, eliminating the Cosworth-powered teams&#x27; use of water tanks to increase their performance. All other runners&#x27; results from the Brazilian Grand Prix were upheld, including Watson&#x27;s, who inherited second place even though his use of the water tanks had been as illegal as the others. The FOCA teams requested a postponement of the next race until July to allow consideration of the effects of the court&#x27;s judgement, on the grounds that it changed the regulations of the sport. The race organisers refused to delay the race, which went ahead without the majority of the FOCA teams. At this stage in the championship, Prost led with 18 points, six ahead of Lauda, with Rosberg and Watson sharing third position on eight points.

With the FOCA teams boycotting the race, the San Marino Grand Prix was run with just 14 cars present. The turbocharged Renaults and Ferraris were heavily favoured and Arnoux duly took pole position ahead of Prost, with Villeneuve and Pironi on the second row. Due to the fast nature of the Imola track, Ferrari team boss Mauro Forghieri told his drivers to save fuel. Arnoux led from the start while Prost lost two positions to the Ferrari drivers on the first lap. He eventually retired on lap seven. After some changes of position with Villeneuve and Pironi, Arnoux pulled away, but retired as well after 44 laps when his engine expired. This left only the Ferrari drivers in a position to win the Grand Prix. Their team held out &quot;slow&quot; signs from the pit wall, urging them to conserve fuel. Villeneuve, who led, understood this to mean that the cars were to finish in the current order. Pironi appeared to disregard the signals from the pitwall and took the lead on lap 46. He then sped up, pulling Villeneuve with him, who retook the lead again on lap 49. They changed position three more times; as Villeneuve slowed down each time he took the lead, Pironi would overtake him again. Eventually, Pironi won the race and Villeneuve was furious at his teammate for allegedly not following team orders. After the race, he said: &quot;People seem to think we had the battle of our lives! [...] I was coasting those last 15 laps.&quot; Pironi said that &quot;The &#x27;slow&#x27; sign means only to use your head [... not that] if you think you can win, don&#x27;t do it.&quot; In an interview the following week, Villeneuve said that he would never speak to Pironi again.
Two weeks later, the paddock moved to Zolder for the Belgian Grand Prix. In qualifying, Villeneuve went out onto the track on his second set of fast tyres, which were already used and had only one more fast lap to go before their performance became compromised. On his flying lap, he failed to better the time of teammate Pironi, but instead of slowing down, as drivers usually did on laps at the end of which they were supposed to head back to the pits, Villeneuve continued to drive fast. It has been speculated that he was determined to beat Pironi&#x27;s time due to the animosity between the two. It is unclear if this is true, with Forghieri claiming that Villeneuve had indeed planned to return to the pitlane. In any event, Villeneuve caught Jochen Mass travelling much more slowly through a left-handed bend and moved to the right to pass him at the same instant that Mass also moved right to let Villeneuve through on the racing line. The two collided and Villeneuve was thrown out of his disintegrating car. He died of a fractured neck in a local hospital at 9:12 that evening.

Ferrari withdrew from the race, which Watson won for McLaren. His teammate Lauda, who had finished third behind Rosberg, was disqualified after the race for an underweight car. The results were dominated by the returning FOCA teams; even the only turbo-engined finisher, Piquet, was one of them, after Brabham reintroduced the BMW-powered BT50 for this race.

Motorsport journalist Nigel Roebuck stated that the next race, the Monaco Grand Prix, &quot;was a sombre, edgy place [...] the sense of [Villeneuve&#x27;s] absence was overwhelming&quot;; the Canadian had lived in the principality and had won the previous year&#x27;s race. Ferrari chose to only run one car, not replacing Villeneuve for the time being. In the race itself, Arnoux led early on from pole position before spinning off, handing the lead to his Renault teammate Prost. The latter in turn built up a massive lead, but a light rain shower in the closing laps triggered a chaotic finish. Prost crashed out, handing the lead to Patrese, still running the Cosworth-powered Brabham BT49D. Patrese spun on the penultimate lap and stalled, allowing Pironi into the lead, followed by de Cesaris. On the final lap, Pironi, de Cesaris, and Daly all retired because they ran out of fuel while in potential race winning positions. Meanwhile, Patrese bump-started his car by coasting down a hill, completed the final two laps, and took his first career victory. Pironi was classified second, despite running out of fuel and stopping on the last lap. After the race, Prost, who had scored no points since the Brazilian Grand Prix in March, led the championship by one point from Watson and two points from Pironi.

==== North American rounds ====

The next race was the inaugural Detroit Grand Prix, which was marred by lack of track preparation, delaying the practice session on a circuit that had never hosted a motor race before. During the shortened qualifying session, Prost took pole position ahead of de Cesaris, with Rosberg in third. The big surprise of the day was defending World Champion Piquet, who failed to qualify as his Brabham BT50 had engine problems and the spare car was not performing well either. In the race, Prost led comfortably until an accident between Roberto Guerrero, Elio de Angelis and Patrese led to the race being suspended. De Cesaris had retired at this point and at the restart, Prost led Rosberg and Pironi. A problem with the fuel injection slowed Prost down, handing the lead to Rosberg. Watson, who qualified 17th on the grid, got his Michelin tyres working well on the Detroit circuit and overtook one driver after another until, on lap 37, he went into the lead, as Rosberg had gearbox issues. Watson won the race from Eddie Cheever and Pironi, taking the lead in the World Championship.

Tragedy struck again at the Canadian Grand Prix. Pironi qualified on pole, but stalled at the start. His stationary car was hit by the Osella of young Italian Riccardo Paletti, who was competing in only his second race in Formula One. Paletti suffered severe internal injuries and his car caught fire while the track marshals tried to extract him from his vehicle. He was pronounced dead upon arrival in the hospital. The race was restarted and won by Piquet in the BMW-powered Brabham ahead of teammate Patrese, still in the Cosworth-powered BT49D. It would be the last one-two finish for the Brabham team in their Formula One history. Watson finished third to consolidate his lead in the championship. After the Canadian round, Watson was on 30 points, ten ahead of Pironi, followed by Patrese on 19, Prost with 18 and Rosberg with 17 points.

==== Back to Europe ====
At the Dutch Grand Prix, Ferrari introduced Patrick Tambay as a replacement for Villeneuve. The Renault drivers once more locked out the front row, Arnoux ahead of Prost. The latter took the lead at the start, followed by Arnoux and Pironi. On lap two, Pironi overtook Arnoux and three laps later moved ahead of Prost into the lead. While Prost retired with an engine failure, Arnoux was lucky to survive a heavy accident on lap 22 at Tarzan corner. His left front wheel broke off as he approached the corner, sending his car into the tyre wall. Pironi won the race without serious competition, ahead of Piquet and Rosberg.

For the next race at Brands Hatch, the British Grand Prix, Brabham had devised what they referred to as &quot;The Ploy&quot;. Inspired by Prost&#x27;s comeback drive at the season opener at Kyalami, the team planned to send out their cars with tanks only half full and softer, and therefore faster, tyres. A pit stop midway through the race was supposed to refuel the car and change tyres, giving the Brabham drivers the advantage to be able to lap quicker than everybody else and gain enough of a lead to win. On top of that, both drivers were now running the BMW-powered BT50 chassis.

In qualifying, Rosberg surprised by taking only the second, and last, non-turbocharged pole position of the season. At the start of the warm-up lap, a fuel pressure issue led to his car being stationary on the grid while the other cars got underway. His mechanics helped him to a push start, but he did not reach the field in time and had to start the race last. This handed the front starting spot to Patrese, but he stalled. Both Arnoux and Fabi ran into him, taking all three out on the spot. Piquet as the only remaining Brabham left led from Lauda, but &quot;The Ploy&quot; was not to be executed, as Piquet retired with fuel injection problems on lap ten. This left Lauda to take his second victory of the season, followed by Pironi and Tambay. Pironi took over the lead of the championship, now five points ahead of Watson.

The Renaults were dominant at their home race, the French Grand Prix at Circuit Paul Ricard. Arnoux qualified ahead of Prost, and with Prost being better positioned in the championship, the team decided that if the cars should run first and second, he should win. Arnoux did not honour the agreement and took the victory ahead of his teammate, much to Prost&#x27;s dismay. Another heavy accident marred the race, as Mass ran into the back of Mauro Baldi at Signes corner. As Mass&#x27;s car slid towards the barrier, it was catapulted into the grandstands full of spectators. Although several people had minor injures, the accident did not result in any fatalities or serious injuries. At this stage, Pironi led the championship by nine points ahead of Watson and was seen as the likely favourite to win the title.

At the following event, the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Pironi qualified on pole position, but collided with Prost&#x27;s Renault in wet conditions later in the session. Pironi&#x27;s car was thrown into the air and though he survived the impact, he suffered severe leg injuries and would never compete in Formula One again. The race took place with the first slot on the grid vacant. Brabham were again attempting to employ the strategy of having their cars refuel and change tyres halfway through the race. Piquet led comfortably when he collided with Salazar while trying to lap him, leading Piquet to furiously hit and kick his competitor after he got out of the car. Tambay went on to win the race for Ferrari, his first victory in a Grand Prix, ahead of Arnoux and Rosberg, who was now third in the championship.

At the Austrian Grand Prix on the Österreichring, most turbocharged runners retired early, leaving Prost in the lead, only to retire with fuel injection issues five laps from the finish. This left de Angelis and Rosberg to fight out the race victory, with de Angelis reaching the finish line 0.050 seconds ahead to win his first ever Grand Prix. The Grand Prix also saw the Brabham drivers make it to their mid-race pit stops for the first time, only for both to retire later on.

Rosberg in turn achieved his maiden victory at the next race, the Swiss Grand Prix, held at the Dijon-Prenois circuit and scheduled for 80 laps. The Renaults of Prost and Arnoux had qualified on the front row. Rosberg, consistently lapping quicker than all other drivers, was held up by de Cesaris, but eventually found a way past him. He overtook Arnoux on lap 73 and Prost on lap 78 to take the lead and the race victory. In doing so, he also took the lead in the championship.

At the Italian Grand Prix, Mario Andretti returned to take over the seat at Ferrari left vacant by Pironi and qualified in pole position. The race was won by Arnoux, leading home the Ferraris of Tambay and Andretti. Rosberg did not score points, having finished eighth. Watson meanwhile took three points for fourth place, leaving him with a mathematical chance of winning the title; this would require him to win the last race of the season with Rosberg failing to score.

==== Last round and title decision ====

At the last race of the season, the Caesars Palace Grand Prix in Las Vegas, Prost took pole position ahead of Arnoux. The race was held in degree weather during a particularly hot time of year in Las Vegas. While Arnoux retired from the race itself, Prost was hampered by blistering tyres to finish fourth. Michele Alboreto took a surprising victory for Tyrrell. Watson finished second, meaning that Rosberg&#x27;s fifth-place finish was enough to secure the title. He became the first driver since Mike Hawthorn in to clinch the championship having won just one Grand Prix.

=== Post-season ===
The 1982 season was the last for Lotus team owner Colin Chapman, who died on 16 December 1982 having suffered a heart attack. Following &quot;a season touched by tragedy, clouded in controversy and enveloped in excitement&quot;, FISA announced that the &quot;ground effect&quot; would be banned for to make the cars safer. Overall, the 1982 season saw 11 different winners in 16 races, with no driver scoring more than two victories. This included nine different winners in the same number of consecutive races. Five drivers scored their first ever Grand Prix victory: Patrese, Tambay, de Angelis, Rosberg, and Alboreto.

<doc id="1140077" wikidata="Q69431" url="?curid=1140077" title="1981 Formula One World Championship">
<text>The 1981 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 35th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1981 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1981 Formula One World Championship for Manufacturers, which were contested over a fifteen-race series that commenced on 15 March and ended on 17 October. The 1981 South African Grand Prix, as a non-championship race due to difficulties from the ongoing FISA–FOCA war, was open to Formula One entrants but was not part of the World Championship.

The 1981 championship was the first to be run under the &quot;FIA Formula One World Championship&quot; name, replacing both the original &quot;World Championship of Drivers&quot; and &quot;International Cup for Constructors&quot;. Under the influence of Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone and the FOCA organisation, teams were asked to sign the first Concorde Agreement, which would set Formula One on course to become a profitable business. The agreement required teams to lodge entries for the entire championship rather than individual races, while the FIA would also set the prize money. A standardised set of rules would be in place at every race and, from on, the entrants had to own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they entered, as such the distinction between the terms &quot;entrant&quot; and &quot;constructor&quot;, and hence also &quot;team&quot;, have become less pronounced.

Nelson Piquet won the Drivers&#x27; Championship, claiming the first of his three drivers&#x27; titles, while Williams won the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the second consecutive year.

==Drivers and constructors==
Avon and Pirelli entered the sport as tyre manufacturers.

The following teams and drivers contested the 1981 FIA Formula One World Championship:
===Team changes===

* After the Shadow team had been absorbed into Theodore Racing halfway through the season. Theodore entered this season with their own chassis and the Shadow name disappeared.
* In 1980, RAM Racing had raced with a customer Williams chassis, but they did not enter the 1981 season. March Engineering, however, used that chassis to make a return to Formula 1. (In , RAM would return to take over from March.)
* After finishing 1–2 in the 1980 European Formula Two Championship, Toleman entered Formula 1. Discussions took place with Lancia as possible engine supplier, the team decided to use a turbocharged version of the Hart F2 engine. It made them one of the early adopters on the trend towards turbocharged cars, but their first chassis was overweight and underpowered.
* Ligier had acquired substantial sponsorship from Talbot and other public French companies. Talbot supplied Matra V12 engines.

===Driver changes===
There had been a lot of change over the winter:
* Ligier had lost Didier Pironi to Ferrari, where World Champion Jody Scheckter had retired. They hired Jean-Pierre Jabouille from Renault, but when the season started, he was still recovering from his leg injuries sustained in the 1980 Canadian Grand Prix. Jean-Pierre Jarier had left the team, but acted as his stand-in for the first two races of the 1981 season.
* Renault managed to sign Alain Prost, despite his two-year contract with McLaren, so the British team had to scramble for a new driver. Main sponsor Marlboro suggested Andrea de Cesaris from Alfa Romeo when he had to move for World Champion Mario Andretti. The American had spent five years with Lotus. Nigel Mansell was promoted to a full-season drive with the Lotus team.
* Tyrrell had lost both of its 1980 drivers and so hired Eddie Cheever from Osella and an inexperienced Kevin Cogan.
* Another ten driver changes happened in the lower-ranking teams.

====Mid-season changes====

* Kevin Cogan did not manage to qualify for the opening race and was sacked by the Tyrrell team. It was Cogan&#x27;s last F1 outing. He was replaced by Ricardo Zunino, who had spent the first half of driving for Brabham. After two races, however, Zunino was moved aside for sportscar driver Michele Alboreto.
* During the first lap of the San Marino Grand Prix, Osella driver Miguel Ángel Guerra was hit by Eliseo Salazar, crashed into a wall and suffered a broken wrist and ankle. Piercarlo Ghinzani made his debut to replace the Argentinian. Later, Giorgio Francia took over for one race, and Jean-Pierre Jarier finished the season, looking forward to a full-season drive in .
* From the Belgian Grand Prix on, Jan Lammers had to give up his seat for Slim Borgudd, the drummer for ABBA. There was no cash sponsorship, but the world famous band&#x27;s logo on the car&#x27;s sidepods was a hopeful move by the ATS team to attract other investors.
* Before the Spanish Grand Prix, Eliseo Salazar moved from March to Ensign, replacing Marc Surer. The Swiss driver moved to Theodore, from where Patrick Tambay moved to Ligier. Their driver Jean-Pierre Jabouille retired from F1, concluding he could not fully recover from last year&#x27;s leg injuries.
* For the last two races of the season, Jacques Villeneuve Sr. (brother of Gilles and uncle to Jacques Jr.) made his F1 debut with Arrows. Their driver Siegfried Stohr was traumatised by the start-line accident at the Belgian Grand Prix and decided to retire to start a racing school and safe driving academy.

==Calendar==
The championship was contested over the following fifteen races:
The following races were included on the original calendar but were cancelled:

===Calendar changes===
* The South African Grand Prix at Kyalami was going to be the season opener on 7 February, but difficulties from the ongoing FISA–FOCA war led to the event being run as a non-championship race. It was contested only by the Ford-Cosworth powered teams, all running cars with aerodynamic devices which were banned for the 1981 championship season.
* The race at Long Beach was the official championship opener after the Argentine and Brazilian Grand Prix had been moved back to March/April. The Brazilian race was also moved from the Interlagos to Jacarepaguá due to a long list of safety issues.
* The Italian Grand Prix was back at Monza after a year&#x27;s absence. The circuit underwent major upgrades including a new pit building. The Autodromo Dino Ferrari also hosted a race, which would be dubbed the San Marino Grand Prix.
* The Spanish Grand Prix returned as a championship round after the 1980 edition had been excluded.
* In keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits, the French Grand Prix was moved from Paul Ricard Circuit to Dijon-Prenois. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone.
* The United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen was originally scheduled for 4 October, but was cancelled due to the hosts&#x27; financial difficulties. It was replaced by the Caesars Palace Grand Prix, held in the Caesars Palace car park.

==Regulation changes==
===Technical regulations===
* For the first time, the survival cell was treated as an entity and an integral part of an F1 car. It had to extend in front of the driver&#x27;s feet and wholly reinforced.
* The minimum weight of the car was raised from to .

===Sporting and event regulations===
* Tyre barriers were installed at certain tracks for the first time.
* All pit lanes had to have a minimum width of .
* At the start of the race, drivers were placed on the grid in a 1x1x1 fashion, instead of a staggered 2x2 pattern.

==Season report==
===Non-championship race: South Africa===
The South African Grand Prix, held on 7 February at the Kyalami Circuit near Johannesburg, was originally supposed to be the first round of the 1981 Formula One World Championship – but it was eventually stripped of its championship status. The ongoing FISA–FOCA war resulted in Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) insisting on a date change which was not acceptable to the race organisers. Approval was ultimately given for the race to go ahead on its original date but as a Formula Libre race rather than as a round of the Formula One World Championship. The downgraded race was supported by the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA) aligned teams but not by Ferrari, Ligier, Osella, Renault, or Alfa Romeo, whose allegiances lay with FISA. This race was run with the cars running in 1980-specification trim, with the ground-effect wing cars of the time, equipped with sliding skirts that increased their downforce by ensuring the air under the car did not escape from under the car, where the most important airflow was.

In qualifying, it was once again a major battle between the major players of 1980. The Brabham of Nelson Piquet battled the two Williams cars of Alan Jones and Carlos Reutemann for pole position. Piquet took pole, with Reutemann in second. Reutemann had a close call when in the closing minutes of the session, his Williams spun off and went into the catch fencing. The fencing had wrapped around his windpipe and had begun to strangle Reutemann, and the hapless Argentine was unable to remove the catchfencing on his own. It was only the quick mobilisation of the marshals that were able to rescue Reutemann from what could have quite easily have been his death. Following Reutemann was Jones, Keke Rosberg in the Fittipaldi, Elio de Angelis (Lotus), Riccardo Patrese (Arrows), Ricardo Zunino (Brabham), Nigel Mansell (Lotus) and Andrea de Cesaris (McLaren).

The race was held in quite wet conditions, however the rain had abated shortly before the start of the grand prix. Notably, only Carlos Reutemann from second on the grid and Keke Rosberg in fourth on the grid who went for slicks, everyone else would choose wet weather tyres. Unsurprisingly, Reutemann and Rosberg made poor starts in the still wet conditions. Piquet maintained his lead as Reutemann dropped behind Elio de Angelis and the fast starting Jan Lammers who had come up from tenth on the grid. Lammers was running well behind De Angelis before he went for the overtake on the second lap. Lammers lost control in the wet conditions and tapped the rear of De Angelis where he spun wide into the gravel trap. He dropped right down to the back of the field where he would go on to retire later in the race with brake fade. Nigel Mansell had made a storming start, moving into fourth place with John Watson right behind him. The reigning champion Alan Jones had dropped down to sixth after a poor start to the race. Derek Daly had also done well to climb up to seventh on March&#x27;s return to F1. On lap 4, both Mansell and Watson moved ahead of Reutemann. A three-way battle for second place then followed with De Angelis, Mansell and Watson. Lap 5 saw Watson move ahead of Mansell, the following lap he moved ahead of the other Lotus of De Angelis. Alan Jones then began a comeback drive, moving ahead of Reutemann and Mansell. On lap 11, Geoff Lees spun off the circuit in his Theodore, Lees unluckily went through the catchfencing and was hit on the head by one of the catchfencing poles. Lees had to be lifted out of the car by the marshalls as he had been briefly knocked unconscious by the pole. The track had then begun to dry, Alan Jones was the first driver to come into slicks with Nigel Mansell following suit, despite having spun on the previous lap. Jones having aquaplaned off the circuit on his out-lap damaged the rear of his car. Jones returned to the pits as his mechanics were forced to repair his rear wing. Jones would later retire with a loose skirt. By this time, only Piquet and Watson were the only front runners not to have pitted. Piquet pitted for new tyres, allowing Watson to take the lead of the race. Watson then followed Piquet into the pits the following lap. Reutemann inherited a comfortable lead; his gamble of racing with dry tyres since the start of the race had paid off. Female racer Desiré Wilson retired on lap 51 when she spun her Tyrrell off the circuit. Reutemann took a comfortable win, 20 seconds ahead of Piquet and ahead of De Angelis, Rosberg and John Watson in a McLaren.

===Race 1: United States West===
The first of two rounds in the United States of America started a trilogy of F1 races in the Americas on March 15 at the Long Beach street circuit in southern California, just outside the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles. Goodyear had decided to withdraw from F1 leaving everyone on Michelin tyres, and the cars were now running in new 1981-specification cars, with the sliding skirts now banned and cars required to have a 6 cm ground clearance in order to reduce downforce. Qualifying resulted in something of a surprise with Patrese on pole in the Arrows with Jones and Reutemann behind him. Piquet was fourth with Villeneuve fifth, home favorite Andretti sixth and Mansell seventh. The top 10 was completed by Cheever, Giacomelli (Alfa Romeo) and Jarier. The circuit had been slightly modified with the second left hander on Pine Avenue made one fluid corner instead of two apexes.

Raceday had typically perfect Long Beach weather, and at the start Villeneuve made an amazing start and charged down to the first corner, Queen&#x27;s Hairpin, so quickly that he overshot, with Patrese going into the lead with Jones and Reutemann chasing. In the middle of the pack, Prost and de Cesaris collided and both went out. Pironi made a remarkable start to go from 11th on the grid to fourth, ahead of Piquet, the recovering Villeneuve, Cheever and Andretti. On the second lap Reutemann overtook Jones for second but otherwise the top six remained unchanged until lap 17, when Pironi was able to pass Piquet for fourth, but on the next lap Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari stopped with a driveshaft failure and so Cheever moved to sixth place. On lap 25 Patrese began to suffer from fuel pressure problems and lost the lead to Reutemann. Patrese soon headed for the pits, everyone moving up a place including Andretti, who took over sixth place. As Jones closed up on Reutemann, the Argentine driver made a mistake on Pine Avenue as he lapped Surer, going wide and Jones going ahead. On the same lap, Laffite overtook Andretti for sixth place and chased after Cheever. The two cars collided on lap 41 on Ocean Boulevard and Laffite ended up in the pits. As Cheever began to drop back, Andretti was able to climb to fifth place and on lap 54 that became fourth when Pironi slowed with an oil leak. Jones thus led another Williams 1–2 with Piquet third, Andretti fourth, Cheever fifth and Tambay sixth in the Theodore.

===Race 2: Brazil===
The Formula One circus moved from North to South America to start a two-stop tour there. The first round was at the Jacarepagua Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro – only the second time F1 had been there. F1 had previously visited the 5-mile Interlagos circuit in São Paulo from 1972 to 1980; this circuit was effectively dropped after 1980 because of safety issues with the circuit and the growing slums around the circuit being at odds with Formula One&#x27;s glamorous image. Tyrrell rented its second car to Zunino but otherwise the field was exactly the same, although the new carbon-fibre McLaren MP4/1 which had been seen in Long Beach was not taken to South America. Jean-Pierre Jabouille tried to qualify the Talbot Ligier, but his legs were clearly not well enough healed from his accident in Montreal six months earlier; the car was handed over to Jean-Pierre Jarier again. Lotus again ran into trouble with the twin-chassised Lotus 88 and there were murmurs about a new hydro-pneumatic suspension on the Brabhams which enabled the cars to be 6 cm off the ground when they were measured but much closer to the ground when they were out on the track. Pole position went to local hero Piquet in his Brabham with the two Williams cars of Reutemann and Jones behind him. Fourth was Patrese in the impressive Arrows while Prost put his Renault fifth ahead of Bruno Giacomelli&#x27;s Alfa Romeo, Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari 126CK, the second Renault of Rene Arnoux, Andretti&#x27;s Alfa Romeo and the Lotus 81B of de Angelis.

It was wet on race morning and the start took place with the track damp but the rain holding off. Piquet decided to go on slick tyres (but everyone else except Didier Pironi and Siegfried Stohr decided to use wets). Prost made a bad start and this caused the fast-starting Villeneuve to have to lift off. Andretti hit the rear of Villeneuve and went over the Ferrari. Behind them Arnoux, Eddie Cheever, Stohr and Chico Serra were all involved. At the front Reutemann went into the lead with Jones, Patrese, Giacomelli, de Angelis and the rest in pursuit. In the early laps de Angelis overtook Giacomelli to take fourth place and when Giacomelli spun off fifth place went to Keke Rosberg&#x27;s Fittipaldi. John Watson made good progress from a poor grid position and on lap 14 he overtook Rosberg for fourth. The Finn then dropped behind Jean-Pierre Jarier (Talbot Ligier) as well. The order at the front remained unchanged until lap 29 when Jarier went wide and dropped behind Marc Surer (Ensign) and Jacques Laffite (Talbot Ligier). On lap 35 Watson spun as the rain increased and so Surer moved to fifth with Laffite sixth. Surer&#x27;s remarkable run went on, and on lap 49 he overtook de Angelis for fourth place while behind him Jarier repassed Laffite for fifth.

In the closing laps the two Talbot Ligiers switched positions again (Jarier being told to drop back by the team), while Jones waited for Reutemann to move aside as the World Champion was the team&#x27;s number one. Reutemann did not budge. The team showed pitboards indicating that Reutemann should move over but he did not. Everyone thought he would be waiting for the last lap but Reutemann took the flag first. Jones was furious and did not take part in the podium ceremony. Patrese finished third with the remarkable Surer fourth ahead of the Talbot Ligiers.

===Race 3: Argentina===
The other half of the South American tour in Reutemann&#x27;s home country of Argentina was usually held in January; this time it was in the cooler weather of April. Reutemann&#x27;s decision to disobey team orders in Brazil had split the Williams team while the Lotus 88 was once again banned. Team boss Colin Chapman was so incensed by the decision that he left before practice even began. There was also a dispute over Brabham&#x27;s new hydro-pneumatic suspension which was designed to overcome the regulation which meant cars had to run with 6 cm of ground clearance; whenever the Brabham was measured it was 6 cm above the ground. The entry list was the same as in Brazil except that Jabouille was back in the Talbot Ligier. He failed to qualify. Also missing out were the two Osellas and Eliseo Salazar&#x27;s March. Thanks to his hydro-pneumatic suspension system Piquet was on pole position with Alain Prost second quickest in the Renault. Then came Jones and Reutemann, Rene Arnoux in the second Renault and Hector Rebaque in the second Brabham. The top 10 was completed by Gilles Villeneuve (Ferrari), Keke Rosberg (Fittipaldi), Riccardo Patrese (Arrows) and Elio de Angelis in the Lotus.

Raceday came about, and at this varied circuit located in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, Jones took the lead at the start, but Piquet got ahead in the course of the first lap by driving around the outside of Jones in one of the corners and he then drove away from the field. He ended the race over 25 seconds ahead. In the course of the second lap Reutemann overtook Jones and the Australian would later drop behind Prost and Rebaque as well. Rebaque&#x27;s Brabham was handling well and so he was able to get ahead of the Renault on lap 11 and soon after he got past Reutemann, so for the middle part of the race the Brabhams were running in 1-2 formation. On lap 33, however, the Mexican disappeared with a distributor problem. This put Reutemann back into second place with Prost third and Jones fourth. Arnoux finished fifth while the final point went to de Angelis after a fight with Patrese and Patrick Tambay (Theodore).

Due to internal politics and the drivers&#x27; strike at the 1982 South African Grand Prix, the Argentine GP would not return to the calendar until 1995.

===Race 4: San Marino (Imola, Italy)===
Three weeks later, the GP circus returned to Europe to start the 4 month long tour there. The first race was a new race – a second Italian race called the San Marino Grand Prix at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari near Imola, just outside Bologna and 50 miles west of the tiny principality of San Marino. Team Lotus had decided to miss the race but in England a new Lotus 87 was being tested to replace the banned twin-chassis Lotus 88. The controversy over hydro-pneumatic suspensions had also faded as all the cars now had systems fitted. The big excitement in the paddock was the appearance of the new Toleman F1 team, complete with a Brian Hart turbo engine and Pirelli tyres. Neither Brian Henton nor Derek Warwick qualified. Otherwise the entry list was little changed, although Tyrrell had replaced Ricardo Zunino with a rising star called Michele Alboreto who brought much-needed backing for the team from a local ceramics company. News had emerged on Friday that the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen had been cancelled, although this was seen as predictable, given the historic circuit&#x27;s financial troubles. Qualifying resulted in a popular pole position for Gilles Villeneuve in the turbocharged Ferrari. The Canadian was seven-tenths ahead of Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Williams while the Renaults of Rene Arnoux and Alain Prost filled the second row. Nelson Piquet was fifth and Ferrari&#x27;s Didier Pironi sixth while the top 10 was completed by John Watson (in the new McLaren MP4/1 - being raced for the first time), Jones, Patrese, and Laffite.

The track was wet at the start and everyone was on wet tyres. This race turned out to be an exciting affair as Villeneuve went into the lead while Pironi was able to use the prodigious power of the Ferrari to blast his way up to second position. At the back of the field there was a nasty accident when F1 debutante Miguel Angel Guerra had a moment in Tosa corner and was then hit by Eliseo Salazar&#x27;s March. This punted the Osella into the barrier at high speed and the Argentine driver had to be cut from the wreck with serious leg injuries. While Guerra was being released from his car the two Ferraris ran away from the rest of the field with Reutemann third, having driven into his teammate Jones to stop the Australian taking third on the first lap. This had damaged Jones&#x27;s front wing and he was soon in the pits for repairs. That put Patrese up to fourth place and he overtook Reutemann a few laps later as the Argentine went off over the grass at the final chicane. Piquet and his Brabham teammate Hector Rebaque completed the top six after Laffite and Arnoux had collided. On lap 14 Villeneuve went into the pits for slicks. As he accelerated away it started to rain again and so two laps later Villeneuve was back in pitlane for wet tyres. Pironi led with Patrese second while Piquet moved to third ahead of Reutemann. The Brazilian later got ahead of Patrese as well, and then started to race hard with Pironi. The top five remained unchanged until the 47th lap when Piquet finally overtook Pironi, the Ferrari having damaged a skirt early on. Pironi drifted back behind Patrese, Reutemann and Rebaque but he finished fifth, just ahead of Andrea de Cesaris&#x27;s McLaren.

===Race 5: Belgium===
In stark contrast to San Marino, the Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder was a shambolic event filled with tragedies and frustration. Politics dominated this event; Gordon Murray&#x27;s hydraulic suspension gave his Brabhams a considerable performance advantage, and the teams had been heavily protesting the system&#x27;s legality within the revised rules for the season. The political bickering over the Concorde Agreement meant that with 32 entries, there were too many cars and pressure was applied to ATS and Theodore to withdraw. ATS withdrew Jan Lammers but ran its second car for Slim Borgudd while Patrick Tambay was left without a drive. The Osella team had Piercarlo Ghinzani driving in place of the injured Miguel Angel Guerra. But the tragedy started with Carlos Reutemann accidentally running over an Osella mechanic, Giovanni Amadeo, who died of a fractured skull the Monday after the race. This accident led to complaints from the drivers about the congestion in the pits.

Qualifying resulted in pole position for Reutemann with Piquet second for Brabham and Pironi third in his turbocharged Ferrari. Fourth place went to Patrese, with the top 10 being completed by Watson, Jones, Villeneuve, Cheever, Laffite, and Mansell.

The race, however, was an appalling embarrassment by top motor racing standards. At the start, there was a drivers&#x27; strike concerning mechanic and team personnel safety, they complained that their views were being ignored, which delayed the start. When the race started, an Arrows mechanic, Dave Luckett, jumped onto the grid just as the clerk of the course hit the lights to go green in an attempt to start Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s stalled car. Luckett was run over by the other Arrows driver, Siegfried Stohr, and as Luckett laid sprawled unconscious on the track with broken legs, the marshals were able to get him off the track. The disorganization continued: as the drivers started their second lap with both Arrows cars still on the narrow start–finish straight, a number of marshals, protesting the clerk&#x27;s dangerous decision, jumped onto the track, mere feet from the cars going at full racing speeds, and attempted to stop the race by waving at the drivers to stop, without the approval of the clerk of the course (who is the ultimate authority on the race&#x27;s direction). The drivers continued on because they had not been shown the red flag by the clerk of the course, who is the only person at a Grand Prix who can show this flag. But by the time they were to start a third lap, the marshals succeeded in stopping the field themselves. In the meantime, Luckett was taken to hospital, and would survive.

When the race restarted neither Arrows took part. Pironi took the lead with Reutemann, Piquet, Watson, and Jones chasing him. The Australian looked very strong in the early laps as he passed Watson and Reutemann and then Jones had a brush with Piquet which left the Brabham in the catchfencing. A furious Piquet charged up to Jones in the pits and attempted to physically fight him. On lap 12 he took the lead from Pironi but eight laps later the Williams jumped out of gear at Bianchibocht and smashed into the barriers. Piquet was fortunate to escape with a scalded thigh caused by water from a demolished radiator. This left Reutemann in the lead from Laffite and Mansell, Pironi having dropped back after going off. Watson was fourth with Villeneuve fifth and de Angelis sixth. It then started to rain, and the race was called off early at 75% distance with Reutemann taking his last victory. In the closing laps Watson faded with gearbox trouble and so Villeneuve finished fourth, de Angelis fifth and Cheever sixth.

===Race 6: Monaco===
The historic Monaco Grand Prix was the scene of an ultra-exciting race. With too many cars entered there had to be a pre-qualifying session to get the field down to 26 for practice. This eliminated both Tolemans, both Marches and the single ATS of Slim Borgudd. A further six were lost in qualifying with Hector Rebaque (Brabham), Rosberg and Chico Serra (Fittipaldi), Jabouille, and the two Osellas (Piercarlo Ghinzani and Beppe Gabbiani) all going home early. At the front of the grid Piquet was on pole in his Brabham with Villeneuve a remarkable second in this near downforce-absent Ferrari and an impressive Mansell third in the new Lotus 87, which made its first appearance. Then came Reutemann, Patrese, de Angelis, Jones, Laffite, and Alain Prost (Renault). Watson completed the top 10 in the McLaren MP4/1.

At the start there was the usual first corner accident as Andrea de Cesaris (McLaren) tangled with Mario Andretti&#x27;s Alfa Romeo. Piquet took the lead with Villeneuve chasing and Mansell third ahead of the two Williams cars. The young Englishman disappeared early on with a suspension problem and Reutemann went out with gearbox trouble and Jones moved up ahead of Villeneuve and began to pressure Piquet for the lead. On lap 53 Piquet came up to lap some backmarkers, went offline and slid off into a barrier at Tabac. Jones took the lead and seemed to have the race in his pocket until lap 67 when he went into the pits with a fuel vaporization problem. He was soon on his way again but Villeneuve saw his chance and began to close in. On lap 72 Villeneuve took the lead at Ste Devote. A disappointed Jones finished second with Laffite third, Pironi fourth, Eddie Cheever fifth (despite being two laps down) and Marc Surer sixth in the Ensign.

===Race 7: Spain===
Three weeks after the Monaco Grand Prix, the narrow and tight Jarama circuit just outside Madrid was the location for the Spanish Grand Prix, and it produced one of the best races of the year. The field had altered somewhat with Eliseo Salazar having left March to join Ensign, displacing Marc Surer. Laffite took pole in his Ligier-Matra with the two Williams-DFVs of Jones and Reutemann second and third ahead of Watson, Prost, and the Alfa of Bruno Giacomelli. Villeneuve was seventh.

Race day was incredibly hot. The temperature would be around 38-degrees Celsius when the race began, with Jones and Reutemann blasting into the lead as Laffite made a poor start with Villeneuve diving into third place at the first corner, snagging Prost&#x27;s front wing as he took the place. At the end of the first lap Villeneuve pulled out of Reutemann&#x27;s slipstream and took second place. Jones quickly built a lead but on lap 14 - when he was around 10 seconds ahead - he went off at Nuvolari. This left Villeneuve in the lead with Reutemann on his tail. Behind them Watson, Laffite and Elio de Angelis emerged from the hurly-burly and all began to close on the dueling leaders. Reutemann was having some trouble with his gearbox and when Laffite arrived behind him there was little Reutemann could do to stop Jacques overtaking. The Argentine would later drop behind Watson as well as the five front-runners became a train of cars, nose-to-tail for the 18 laps of the race. Villeneuve had the power to get away from his rivals on the straight but in the corners they were all over him. Time and time again Laffite pulled alongside as they emerged from a corner but the Ferrari would surge ahead as the horsepower kicked in. Villeneuve, Jacques Laffite, John Watson, Reutemann and Elio de Angelis remained locked together right to the flag, crossing the line covered by just 1.24s to record the second closest race in the history of F1 at the time. Villeneuve, in a powerful but very ill-handling Ferrari, managed to keep 4 better-handling cars behind him in a car that was badly suited to the slow, narrow and twisty Jarama circuit.

The small crowd, the inappropriate time of year this race was held in and the waning interest of the organizers caused this race to be the last Spanish Grand Prix until 1986, when it was moved south to the new Jerez circuit near Seville.

===Race 8: France===
Two weeks after Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s extraordinary victory in Spain, the alternating French Grand Prix moved from the Paul Ricard circuit near Marseille to the fast, sweeping Prenois circuit near Dijon, located in the Burgundy countryside where the F1 gathered with Carlos Reutemann well ahead of Nelson Piquet in the World Championship.

Marc Surer (displaced from Ensign by Eliseo Salazar) had taken over the Theodore drive, leaving Patrick Tambay out of work. However, Jabouille had decided to retire as he was no longer competitive as a result of the leg injuries he had suffered in Canada in 1980 and so Tambay became the second Talbot Ligier driver. This was perfect as it reduced the field to 30 cars and meant that there was no need for pre-qualifying. The other news was that Goodyear had returned to F1 and so Williams and Brabham appeared on Goodyear tyres, while Ensign and March used Avon. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Arnoux&#x27;s Renault. This was not a surprise but second place for Watson&#x27;s McLaren MP4/1 was rather startling, particularly as the Marlboro car was ahead of the second Renault driven by Prost. Fourth place went to Piquet with Andrea de Cesaris (McLaren), Laffite, Reutemann, de Angelis, Jones and Mario Andretti (Alfa Romeo) completing the top 10.

On the first lap Piquet took the lead from Watson, Prost, de Cesaris and Villeneuve (who had been 11th on the grid in his Ferrari) while Arnoux dropped back to ninth. Prost soon moved ahead of Watson while further back de Cesaris was pushed behind Villeneuve, although both men were then overtaken by Reutemann. Arnoux recovered to run fifth and he moved up to fourth ahead of Reutemann on lap 33 only to run into trouble and drop back behind the Argentine driver.

On lap 58 there was a torrential downpour and the race was stopped. The weather cleared up quickly and so it was decided that the second part of the race would be run with the grid based on the finishing order of the first part. This time Piquet was engulfed by Prost&#x27;s Renault and he was followed ahead by Watson and Arnoux. Piquet faded quickly behind Pironi and any advantage he had had in the first part of the race disappeared. Prost stayed ahead all the way to the flag to win his first of 51 F1 victories at home in a Renault and he was followed home by Watson. Piquet was given third place (although he was fifth on the road) while the remaining points went to Arnoux, Pironi and de Angelis. Prost was to become one of the greatest drivers in Formula One history in the future.

===Race 9: Britain===
The British Grand Prix was held at the flat Silverstone circuit this year, which was the fastest Grand Prix circuit in the world at the time. The field was almost the same as at Dijon two weeks earlier except that Jean-Pierre Jarier had been hired to drive for Osella in place of Miguel Angel Guerra. Team Lotus appeared with the Lotus 88B but once again the team ran into trouble with FISA over the legality of the car and eventually the cars were disqualified. As they had been built by cannibalizing the 87s the team had no choice but to withdraw. Qualifying resulted in a 1-2 for the Renaults of Arnoux and Prost with Nelson Piquet third in his Brabham. The Brazilian used a new BMW turbo-engined BT50 in the course of practice but set his time in the old BT49C. Pironi was fourth fastest for Ferrari and then came the two McLarens of Watson and de Cesaris. The fourth row featured Jones alongside Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari while the top 10 was completed by Reutemann (Williams) and Patrese (Arrows).

Raceday was on a Saturday, and at the start Prost walked away from the field. At the start of lap 5, near the Woodcote chicane, Villeneuve lost control, taking out Alan Jones (Williams) and Andrea de Cesaris (McLaren) who were both unable to avoid the Canadian, while Briton John Watson, in the other McLaren, narrowly missed the wreckage. Villeneuve managed to get the Ferrari going again but only got as far as Stowe Corner before parking. On lap 12, Nelson Piquet, who was 3rd at that point, crashed his Brabham at Becketts and had to be carried by an ambulance due to leg injuries. Later in the race, Prost was forced to pit due to problems with an engine plug that could not be replaced without dismantling much of the car, forcing the Frenchman to retire and leaving his teammate, Arnoux, in the lead. Watson was now fighting back, and after being delayed by the Villeneuve-Jones incident he overtook Reutemann and Andretti, and closed on Pironi. As he overtook the Ferrari it blew up and went out and so Watson was a safe third with only the two Renault drivers ahead. On the 17th lap Prost&#x27;s engine blew but Arnoux remained firmly ahead with Watson second, Reutemann third, Andretti fourth, Patrese fifth and Hector Rebaque (Brabham) sixth. Patrese soon moved ahead of Andretti while Rebaque dropped down the order when he stopped for new tyres, Laffite moving into sixth place. The order was then settled until the 50th lap when the Renault engine began to sound odd and Watson began to close up quickly. On the 60th lap he went ahead. At the same moment Andretti disappeared with a throttle cable failure and as Arnoux faded through the field Patrese went out with an engine failure. This meant that the final order was Watson taking victory, with Reutemann, Laffite, Eddie Cheever (Tyrrell), Rebaque and Slim Borgudd (ATS) rounding out the points.

===Race 10: Germany===
The German Grand Prix at the very fast, straight dominated Hockenheimring saw the field being unchanged apart from the fact that Team Lotus was back in action with a pair of Lotus 87s, both sporting new JPS sponsorship. There were some changes of tyres with Tyrrell running on Avons, Lotus on Goodyear and Arrows on Pirellis. It was no surprise to see the two Renault turbo cars on the front row with Prost nearly half a second quicker than Arnoux. World Championship leader Reutemann was third with his Williams teammate Jones fourth. Pironi was fifth in his Ferrari, and Piquet was sixth in his Brabham (apparently without any problems from his Silverstone accident), while the top 10 was completed by Laffite, Villeneuve, and the two McLarens of Watson and de Cesaris.

The race turned out to be a classic, and at the start Prost took the lead but Reutemann managed to get ahead of Arnoux. On the run down to the first chicane Pironi also went past Arnoux and Piquet tried the same at the Ostkurve. The Renault and the Brabham touched. This meant that Arnoux had to pit at the end of the lap with a deflated right rear. While this was going on Jones went past Piquet. Halfway around the second lap Pironi disappeared with a blown engine, with Prost leading over Reutemann, Jones, Piquet, Laffite, Villeneuve and Patrick Tambay (Talbot Ligier). Villeneuve soon dropped away but Jones was in combative form and was challenging Prost for the lead in a superb battle. Behind them Piquet had overtaken Reutemann and was closing up; the fight for the lead was soon between the three cars. But Piquet&#x27;s tyres, improperly worn from his Brabham suffering bodywork damage, could not take the pace and he dropped back behind Reutemann. On lap 21 Jones finally managed to get ahead of Prost in the stadium when they were lapping Arnoux. Behind the top five Rebaque had moved into sixth but this became fifth when Reutemann stopped on lap 28 with an engine failure. At two-thirds distance rain began to fall and as the Renault became more difficult to control Piquet was able to take second from Prost. Jones&#x27;s car then began to misfire and soon Piquet and Prost were both ahead. Jones headed for the pits. Piquet thus inherited victory with Prost second, Laffite third and Rebaque fourth. Eddie Cheever was fifth with Watson sixth.

===Race 11: Austria===
When F1 descended upon the fast and sweeping Österreichring, the entry was as normal except that the Fittipaldi team, which was struggling for money, was not present because it did not have enough engines. Tyrrell had switched from Avon tyres to Goodyear. Eddie Cheever would fail to make the grid in the new Tyrrell 011. With Austria&#x27;s extra altitude the turbocharged cars were at an advantage, so Arnoux and Prost put their Renaults on the front row with Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari third. Laffite was next up in the Talbot Ligier (powered by a Matra V12 engine) while Williams teammates Carlos Reutemann and Alan Jones were fifth and sixth. The top 10 was completed by Nelson Piquet, Didier Pironi, Elio de Angelis, and Riccardo Patrese.

At the start Villeneuve blasted his Ferrari into the lead ahead of Prost, Arnoux and Pironi (who had made a fast start in his Ferrari). Villeneuve pushed too hard on the second lap and went off at the chicane, rejoining in sixth place. This left Prost and Arnoux to pull away while Pironi&#x27;s Ferrari provided a road block for those chasing. The cork stayed in the bottle until the ninth lap, by which time 7 cars were stuck behind the Renaults, which had a lead of nearly 20 seconds. Pironi&#x27;s Ferrari was quicker in the straights but the car&#x27;s severe lack of downforce compared to the others meant it was noticeably slower through the Österreichring&#x27;s high-speed sweepers. Villeneuve crashed heavily at the Bosch Kurve while Laffite made it through with a very brave pass at the first Panorama curve and he was followed by Piquet. Laffite began to close up but then the gap stabilized. Pironi dropped back behind the two Williams cars, Jones still leading Reutemann. By mid-distance Laffite was within striking distance of the Renaults before Prost suffered a suspension failure and went out, allowing Arnoux to take the lead. On lap 39 Laffite finally managed to get ahead as the pair diced through traffic. Arnoux had to settle for second while third went to Piquet. Jones and Reutemann were fourth and fifth and the final point went to John Watson (McLaren).

===Race 12: Holland===
The Fittipaldi team was back in action for the Dutch GP at the Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam after missing the Austrian GP but had switched to Pirelli tyres. Otherwise the field was the same as usual and it was an all-Renault front row with Alain Prost outqualifying Rene Arnoux. Third place went to World Championship challenger Piquet with his rival Reutemann fifth, behind his Williams teammate Jones. Laffite was sixth in his Talbot Ligier just ahead of Andretti, Watson, de Angelis, and Patrese. Andrea de Cesaris qualified 13th but was withdrawn because the team was worried that he would damage another car, his season with the team having seen a string of accidents. The Italian De Cesaris, although quick, was horrendously erratic - he ended up crashing no less than 19 times this season, including 8 times during a race, and even more remarkably without injuring himself once.

At the start Prost and Arnoux went into Tarzan ahead but behind them Gilles Villeneuve tried to make up for his poor qualifying and charged through a gap between Patrese and Bruno Giacomelli&#x27;s Alfa Romeo. Giacomelli was unaware that Villeneuve was there and the result was that Villeneuve ran into the Alfa, vaulted over it and landed, spinning. At the next corner Andretti and Reutemann collided and the American ended up with a bent front wing. Also in trouble were Pironi and Tambay, the pair having collided in the course of the first lap. This left Prost leading Arnoux and Jones with Piquet fourth, Laffite fifth and Reutemann sixth. In the opening laps Jones went ahead of Arnoux and the Frenchman soon dropped behind Piquet and Laffite as well. By the 10th lap Reutemann too was clear of Arnoux and a couple of laps later Watson drove around the outside of Arnoux at Tarzan to take sixth place. The order at the front remained unchanged but Jones was beginning to challenge Prost. Behind these two there was another lively battle for fourth between Laffite and Reutemann. This ended on lap 18 with the pair colliding. Jones tried to pass Prost on several occasions but then his tyres became marginal and he dropped away. In the closing laps he fell into the clutches of Piquet and lost second place. Hector Rebaque gave Brabham fourth place after a steady run with the other points going to de Angelis and Eliseo Salazar in the Ensign, one of the few men still running, albeit two laps down. Piquet&#x27;s second place meant that he was equal on points with Reutemann.

===Race 13: Italy===
The second Italian and last European race of the year, the Italian Grand Prix, returned to the historic Monza circuit just outside Milan after a year&#x27;s stay at Imola. Nelson Piquet and Carlos Reutemann arrived on equal points in the World Championship, and the summer had been seen the emergence as a major force of Alain Prost in the Renault and he too was becoming the threat to the World Championship leaders. The switching around of tyres continued with Tyrrell deciding to go back to Goodyear at least for Eddie Cheever&#x27;s car. The field was the same as usual with Arnoux on pole in the Renault ahead of Reutemann&#x27;s Williams and Prost. Laffite was fourth in his Ligier and he was clear of Jones, who had arrived in Italy after being physically beaten up by 5 men in London; and Piquet while the top 10 was completed by Watson, Pironi and Villeneuve in the powerful but evil-handling Ferraris and Giacomelli&#x27;s Alfa Romeo. The event was significant in that it marked the first start for the Toleman team, Brian Henton having finally qualified one of the Toleman-Hart cars in 23rd position on the grid after a season of disappointment. At the start Pironi made an exceptional start and he was fourth at the first chicane behind Prost, Reutemann and Arnoux. By the time the field arrived on the back straight Pironi was second. It did not last long Arnoux moved to second on the fifth lap and on lap six Laffite went to third (having overtaken Jones, Piquet and Reutemann). Villeneuve followed him but disappeared with turbo failure soon afterwards. Then Laffite began to drop back with a slow puncture and it began to rain. Jacques went off. This left the two Renaults and the two Williams cars ahead but with a gap between them. Arnoux then went off at the Parabolica, swerving to avoid Eddie Cheever&#x27;s abandoned Tyrrell and so Prost was left on his own.

There was then a huge accident at the Lesmo when Watson lost control of his MP4/1. It spun into the barriers and the engine was ripped from the tub. Watson emerged unhurt but the engine went across the road, causing Michele Alboreto to crash his Tyrrell. The next to arrive was Reutemann and he had to take to the grass and so he dropped behind Giacomelli. The Alfa driver was not in luck however and on lap 26 his Alfa went into the pits with his gearbox jammed. this put Piquet into third place behind Prost and Jones and it looked like staying that way until the last lap when his engine blew, which allowed Reutemann, de Angelis and Pironi to pass him. He picked up just one point and Reutemann moved three points ahead in the World Championship.

===Race 14: Canada===
The season concluded with two races in North America, the first of these being in Montreal, Canada. Alan Jones announced that he was retiring for Formula 1 and there were rumors that Mario Andretti would do the same. At the same time, Niki Lauda was spotted testing one of the new McLaren MP4/1s at Donington Park and it looked like he would be making a comeback. Siegfried Stohr, after his trauma in Belgium and the uncompetitiveness of the Arrows, then decided that he no longer wanted to be an F1 driver and a deal was struck for Riccardo Patrese to be partnered in Canada by Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s brother Jacques Villeneuve. Qualifying resulted in pole position for Piquet with his title rival Reutemann alongside. Jones was third while Prost was fourth in his Renault.

The weather had turned cold and wet by race day and at the start Jones took the lead after banging wheels with Reutemann. The Argentine driver had to lift off and he was overtaken by rival Piquet, Prost and de Angelis. Further back, Villeneuve tipped Arnoux into a spin, the Renault bashing into Pironi&#x27;s Ferrari as it went off. In the laps that followed Villeneuve moved up to take third on lap 7 when Jones spun and Piquet dropped back as he tried to avoid the Williams. This let Prost take the lead with Laffite second. Watson moved to fourth and things began to settle down until lap 13 when Laffite moved into the lead. He was followed through into second place a few laps later by Villeneuve and as Prost faded further he fell behind Watson as well. Watson was then able to catch and pass Villeneuve as well, with the race finishing in that order. Fourth place ended up going to Bruno Giacomelli (Alfa Romeo), fifth to Piquet and sixth to de Angelis. Piquet&#x27;s two points mean that he and Reutemann headed to Las Vegas separated by a point while Laffite had an outside chance of winning the title.

===Race 15: Caesars Palace (United States)===
The Watkins Glen circuit in the state of New York was removed from the calendar in May due to bankruptcy of the company operating the circuit, resulting in a three-week long gap between the Canadian Grand Prix and the new Caesars Palace Grand Prix, at a circuit located in a car park outside of the Caesars Palace hotel and casino complex in Las Vegas, Nevada. During this time frame, Niki Lauda announced his decision to return to F1 with McLaren in 1982. Many in the F1 paddock were confused and unhappy to be racing around the car park of a Las Vegas casino.

World Championship leader Carlos Reutemann qualified on pole ahead of his teammate Alan Jones. The Australian had no intent to do anything to help the Argentine to the title because of their clash over team orders at the start of the year. He was retiring from F1 after the race and had nothing to lose whilst prioritizing a victory. Third on the grid was Gilles Villeneuve in the Ferrari, with Reutemann&#x27;s title rival Nelson Piquet fourth, Alain Prost fifth in his Renault and John Watson sixth in the McLaren.

In dry, conditions, Jones took the lead at the start with Reutemann dropping behind Villeneuve, Prost and Giacomelli before the first corner, while Piquet was eighth. With Villeneuve holding up those behind, Jones drove to an unchallenged victory. Prost overtook Villeneuve on lap three but his Renault was not as fast as Jones&#x27; Williams. On the next lap Laffite overtook Watson and the order then stabilized with Piquet running behind Reutemann, both men out of the points. On lap 17 Piquet passed the subdued Reutemann and he was followed by Andretti. Piquet chased after Watson and took sixth place on lap 22. This was briefly fifth when Villeneuve stopped with a fuel injection problem. But Nelson was then overtaken by Andretti. A few moments later Giacomelli&#x27;s promising run in fourth place ended when he went off and rejoined back in ninth position with Piquet was back in fifth but when Reutemann overtook Watson for sixth the pair were back on equal points (although Piquet would win the title on victories if the order stayed as is). Andretti retired with a broken rear suspension as Piquet moved to fourth and Reutemann to fifth. Soon afterwards Prost pitted for tyres and dropped to sixth but at the same time Mansell went ahead of Reutemann and as Prost recovered the Argentine lost another place. Prost&#x27;s recovery would take him to second place, while Reutemann&#x27;s unimpressive afternoon continued as he drifted behind the recovering Giacomelli. Piquet got up to third when Laffite went in for tyres but he was then overtaken by Mansell and Giacomelli, the Italian moving up to third in the closing laps. Jones would win the first Caesars Palace Grand Prix, ahead of Prost, Giacomelli, Mansell, Piquet and Laffite.

With Reutemann out of the points, Piquet&#x27;s fifth place was enough to win his first of 3 World Championship titles.

==Non-championship race==
A single non-championship Formula One race was also held in 1981. It was technically a Formula Libre race, since the cars did not conform to the current Formula One regulations. Although not a part of the World Championship, the 1981 South African Grand Prix attracted high-calibre drivers and cars and was won by Carlos Reutemann in a Williams.

<text>The 1980 Formula One season was the 34th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1980 &quot;World Championship of Drivers&quot; and the 1980 &quot;International Cup for F1 Constructors&quot;, which were contested concurrently from 13 January to 5 October over a fourteen-race series. The season also included one non-championship race, the Spanish Grand Prix.

Alan Jones, driving a Williams-Ford, became the first Australian to win the World Championship since Jack Brabham in . The season saw a major change of guard in Formula One with the Williams team&#x27;s first Drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; titles, the emergence of Nelson Piquet as a championship contender and the debut of future World Champions Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell, while reigning champions Jody Scheckter and Ferrari suffered a terrible season that resulted in Scheckter retiring from the sport at the end of the year. In addition, Frenchman Patrick Depailler lost his life while testing at Hockenheim.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following drivers and constructors contested the 1980 World Championship of Drivers and the 1980 International Cup for F1 Constructors.
===Team and driver changes===
* Arturo Merzario and Héctor Rebaque had participated in the season, building their own chassis and driving themselves. However, both had closed down their F1 operations at the end of the year.
* Osella had been close to winning the 1979 European Formula Two Championship with driver Eddie Cheever. After securing the sponsorhsip of the Italian Tobacco Organization, they entered Formula 1 in 1980, taking Cheever with them. The American previously drove for Theodore and Hesketh in 1978.
* Williams signed Carlos Reutemann. The Argentinian had finished third in the championship in as well as , but had suffered a difficult season with Lotus. Ex-Williams driver Clay Regazzoni rejoined Ensign Racing, having driven for them in , after Marc Surer had moved to ATS.
* ATS also signed Jan Lammers, coming from the slowly dissapating Shadow team. Lammers&#x27; 1979 teammate Elio de Angelis moved to Lotus after Reutemann had left. For 1980, Shadow signed David Kennedy, runner-up in the 1979 British Formula One Championship, and Stefan Johansson, while he was still just a British F3 driver.
* Jacky Ickx had retired at the end of 1979, his Ligier seat taken up by Didier Pironi.
* 1979 European F3 champion Alain Prost made his F1 debut with McLaren. He replaced Patrick Tambay, who went on to become the 1980 Can-Am champion with Haas Lola.
* Fittipaldi signed future champion Keke Rosberg after buying the remains of the Wolf team at the end of last season.
* Whilst still recovering from a hang gliding accident, Patrick Depailler joined Alfa Romeo, taking the place of Vittorio Brambilla.

====Mid-season changes====
* Marc Surer crashed while qualifying at Kyalami, injuring both his legs. ATS had just reduced their operations from two to one car and parted with Jan Lammers, but the Dutchman rejoined for three more races, while Surer recovered.
* Clay Regazzoni was paralysed from the waist down when he lost his brakes at Long Beach, slamming into a parked car and a concrete barrier. Tiff Needell, Jan Lammers and Geoff Lees would take over the seat, in that order. Lees had already driven for Shadow earlier that year, after Stefan Johansson failed to qualify for his first two races and his debut was deemed preliminary.
* Half way through the season, the Shadow operation was taken over by Theodore Racing. Theodore would enter the season with their own first chassis.
* RAM Racing entered the British Grand Prix with a 1979-spec Williams FW07, driven by Rupert Keegan. They stayed for the rest of the season, even entering a second car for the final two races. (RAM had been involved in F1 since , but it would take until before they entered a full season entry and built their own chassis.)
* Héctor Rebaque returned to Formula 1, replacing Ricardo Zunino at Brabham from the British Grand Prix on.
* During a private testing session at Hockenheim, Alfa Romeo driver Patrick Depailler was killed in a crash. The team&#x27;s 1979 driver Vittorio Brambilla returned for two races, before handing the drive over to debutant Andrea de Cesaris.
* Lotus test driver Nigel Mansell made his debut when Colin Chapman awarded him with three race starts, driving a development version of the Lotus 81. He would go on to be their full-season driver for .
* Just over a year after winning his first race in Formula 3, Mike Thackwell was driving in Formula Two and, at the Dutch Grand Prix, was granted his first Formula 1 test by Ken Tyrrell. He made his racing debut at the Canadian Grand Prix, making him the youngest F1 driver up to then (although the race was red-flagged and he was asked to give his car to Tyrrell driver Jean-Pierre Jarier for the restart, so the record is arguable).

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Brazilian Grand Prix was originally supposed to return to Jacarepaguá, but parts of the track, originally built on a swamp, were beginning to sink into the soft ground, so the race was held at Autodromo de Interlagos, like the year before.
* The Spanish Grand Prix, held on 1 June, was to be a championship race but it had a FISA–FOCA war concerning ground-effect aerodynamics. As a result of the war, Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo boycotted the event. It was announced before Friday practice that the race was not going to be held under FISA regulations and, therefore, would not count towards the championship. The race was won by Alan Jones.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Dijon-Prenois to Paul Ricard Circuit, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch.
* The Italian Grand Prix was moved from the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza to the Autodromo Dino Ferrari while Monza underwent major upgrades, including a new pit building.

====Provisional calendar====
Originally, 1980 was to be an eighteen-race championship, but three Grands Prix were cancelled before the season began:
* The Mexican Grand Prix was scheduled to be held on 13 April, but the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez circuit was not renovated in time.
* The Swedish Grand Prix was originally scheduled to be held on 14 June at Anderstorp Raceway, but was cancelled as enthusiasm for Formula One in Sweden had faded as a result of the deaths of Swedish drivers Ronnie Peterson and Gunnar Nilsson. There was never another Swedish Grand Prix.
* The Caesars Palace Grand Prix was originally supposed to be held on 2 November, but the race was cancelled. It would go through in .

==Season report==
===Round 1: Argentina===
The 1980 Formula One season started in Argentina in January. This event, held at the Buenos Aires Municipal Autodrome located in the sprawling Argentine capital started off badly. After Friday&#x27;s practice, due to the heat and the suction these ground-effect cars were creating, the track began to break up, and the drivers found conditions difficult and even dangerous. Led by Emerson Fittipaldi, the drivers staged a semi-unsuccessful protest – the organizers did actually fix the track, but not successfully – come race day, the track was still in a dreadful condition. The race went ahead anyway, and the Buenos Aires circuit, being one of the most varied and challenging circuits on the calendar, provided an ultra-exciting race, where many drivers were caught-out by the disintegration of the twisty arena infield section of the No.15 variant of the racing facility. After going off twice and dropping back to 4th after making a pit-stop to clean grass out of his car&#x27;s radiators, Australian and title favorite Alan Jones took victory in his Williams-Ford/Cosworth. Brazilian Nelson Piquet, who also went off a few times finished 2nd, and Finn Keke Rosberg scored an excellent 3rd in his Fittipaldi. French rookie Alain Prost, in his first ever F1 race, finished 6th and scored his first ever World Championship point. Gilles Villeneuve, competitive throughout in his Ferrari, crashed heavily at the Toboggan left-right sequence of corners after his front suspension failed after possible damage caused to it after a number of off-track excursions the Canadian had during the race.

===Round 2: Brazil===
The other half of the South American January tour took place in Brazil. This meeting was also met with pre-race difficulties. The safety conditions of the very difficult, demanding and confined 5-mile Interlagos circuit located in the steel-making metropolis of São Paulo had been heavily protested by the drivers for some time, led by South African Ferrari driver Jody Scheckter. The original arrangement was that this Grand Prix was originally supposed to be held at the Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro, and then the drivers would return to Interlagos for 1981 after it would go through a complete resurfacing; but the Jacarepaguá circuit had problems with the tarmac sinking into the ground, so the only option was to return to São Paulo. The drivers protested that the Interlagos track&#x27;s surface (already notorious for being very rough) was so bad that it was actually dangerous to race on. Also, the barriers and catch-fence arrangements were not adequate enough to protect the cars from the embankments and very rough and uneven-surface of the limited run-off areas there, even though the track was very wide in most places. But the race went ahead anyway, and the Renault of Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jabouille took pole and led for 25 of 40 laps. The Renaults proved to be dominant at Interlagos, which was 2,840 ft (850 m) above sea level, giving the turbocharged Renault engines a considerable horsepower advantage. But he retired with turbo failure and his teammate Rene Arnoux took the lead and won, followed by Italian new-boy Elio de Angelis in a Lotus and Jones in his Williams.

===Round 3: South Africa===
The F1 teams arrived in South Africa in March, at the fast Kyalami circuit between Johannesburg and Pretoria in the midst of an African summer. Alain Prost crashed his McLaren at the Esses and broke his wrist; he would miss this and the next race in Long Beach; while Marc Surer had it worse – he crashed heavily at Crowthorne and broke his leg; he missed the next 3 races. Like Interlagos before, the even higher altitude of Kyalami helped the Renaults even more so than in Brazil, and this proved to be an invaluable advantage, and the yellow French cars dominated the race. And as in São Paulo, Jabouille led for a while and retired, and Arnoux took the lead from 2nd place and won the race. However, this race effectively brought the FISA–FOCA war into the spotlight. FISA, the governing body of international motorsports (and the organization that the 3 big constructors – Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo – were aligned to) led by Jean-Marie Balestre, argued that the ground effect cars of the time were too fast through corners, and FOCA (Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association, representing the mostly British independent constructors) led by Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley, argued that the superior road-holding of the independent teams&#x27; cars equalized their cars to the power advantages that particularly the Renaults had.

===Round 4: United States West===
A stop-over in Long Beach, California right next to the Hollywood-dominated landscape of Los Angeles happened 4 weeks after the South African race. The typically pleasant and sunny weather there gave for a relaxed atmosphere at this tight, twisty and rough street circuit (1 of 2 on the calendar – the other being Monaco) which was in contrast to the previous 3 quick Southern Hemisphere circuits used thus far in the season. With its tight, slow layout being lined with unforgiving concrete walls, Long Beach was known then to be the toughest and most punishing race of the season on the car and driver. Nelson Piquet effectively dominated this race in his Brabham-Ford/Cosworth – he took pole, set fastest lap, led from start to finish and took his first of 23 race victories. But the race itself was littered with accidents – there was a pile-up at the Le Gasomet hairpin caused by Alfa Romeo driver Bruno Giacomelli and the 40-year-old Swiss Clay Regazzoni crashed appallingly at the end of the long, flat-out Shoreline Drive when the brakes on his Ensign failed and he crashed head on at 180 mph into Ricardo Zunino&#x27;s parked Brabham, then through some tires and into a concrete wall. The Swiss was critically injured, but survived; he would be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life.

===Round 5: Belgium===
The cancellation of the Mexican Grand Prix, supposed to have taken place 2 weeks after Long Beach created a 5-week gap between Long Beach and the Belgian Grand Prix. The F1 circus started its 4-month long European tour at Zolder, where Frenchman Didier Pironi took his first ever victory in his Ligier-Ford/Cosworth ahead of Alan Jones and his Argentine teammate Carlos Reutemann.

===Round 6: Monaco===
The classic street race in Monaco provided some excitement: there was a big pile-up at the start, where Derek Daly went flying twice over a number of cars at the first corner. He took out Prost in a McLaren, his teammate Jean-Pierre Jarier and Bruno Giacomelli in an Alfa. Didier Pironi led and crashed, and Carlos Reutemann took the lead and won from Frenchman Jacques Laffite in a Ligier-Ford/Cosworth and Piquet in a Brabham.

===Non-championship race: Spain===
The Spanish Grand Prix at the tight and twisty Jarama circuit near Madrid ended up losing its championship status after Jean-Marie Balestre announced on morning of Friday&#x27;s practice (in an attempt to put FOCA in their place after drivers driving for FOCA-aligned teams did not show up to drivers&#x27; meetings at the previous 2 Grands Prix) that the 1980 Spanish GP would not count as a championship round. Balestre also stripped the drivers of their racing licenses. The FISA-supported manufacturer teams – Renault, Ferrari, and Alfa – all pulled out, and the FOCA-supported independent constructors stayed to race. The race was won by Alan Jones, who had also taken pole. The race&#x27;s loss of championship status hurt the event quite badly; as it was only to be hosted once more at Jarama during the following year, which saw reduced crowds and a date even further into the year in one of the hottest parts of Europe.

===Round 7: France===
The abrupt non-championship status of the Spanish Grand Prix and the cancellation of the Swedish Grand Prix at the Anderstorp circuit meant there was a 6-week gap between the Monaco and French Grands Prix. The French Grand Prix took place while the Spanish Grand Prix debacle was still raging on 4 weeks afterwards. With their racing licenses given back to them, the drivers got on with their jobs, and at the Paul Ricard circuit on the southern French riviera near Marseille, Williams driver Jones beat the Ligiers of Jacques Laffite and Didier Pironi on home soil. Jones won the race by 4.52 seconds from a charging Pironi after he had been held up by teammate Laffite for a number of laps.

===Round 8: Great Britain===
The British Grand Prix in 1980 was at Brands Hatch, just outside London. This race on the challenging and bumpy southern English circuit saw the Ligiers of Pironi and Laffite lead and fall out; Pironi retired after a puncture and Laffite crashed at Hawthorn&#x27;s. Alan Jones took advantage of the Ligier&#x27;s problems and Jones managed to hold off a quick Nelson Piquet to win yet again in a Williams, the English team&#x27;s second consecutive British GP win.

===Round 9: West Germany===
The German Grand Prix at the ultra-fast Hockenheimring was marred by the fatal pre-race testing accident of Patrick Depailler at the ultra-high speed, top gear, flat out Ost-Kurve 9 days before the race. Suspension failure on his Alfa caused him to crash massively after his car overturned and vaulted the barriers, causing fatal head injuries. Alan Jones took pole from Renault driver Jabouille by mere hundredths of a second, and he led the race until he had to come in with a puncture on the straight before the stadium. Laffite and Reutemann passed Jones, who finished 3rd. Laffite went on to win for Ligier, followed by the Williams duo of Reutemann and Jones.

===Round 10: Austria===
The European high-speed circuit tour kept coming, and the fastest circuit of the seasonthe spectacular Österreichring in the Styrian mountainsenabled Jabouille to win by mere seconds from Alan Jones. Renault driver Jabouille, who had retired from every race he had participated in so far in the season, finally finished a race. His development work with Renault over the past 4 seasons gave him his 2nd and last F1 victory of his career.

===Round 11: The Netherlands===
The beach-side Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam, modified from the previous year saw Brazilian Nelson Piquet win from Frenchmen Arnoux and Laffite. The Renaults dominated qualifying, although Jabouille retired and Jones went out after accident damage.

===Round 12: Italy===
The European tour concluded with the Italian Grand Prix being held at the Autodromo Dino Ferrari near the town of Imola, rather than Monza. The Dino Ferrari circuit, located near the Ferrari factory and just outside Bologna had signed a deal to alternate the Italian GP with Monza, on the condition Monza improve its track safety and facilities. Although the Monza track owners had already made safety upgrades a year before, the deal had been signed before Monza made changes; so for the first time since 1948 (and for the only time during the World Championship era) the Italian GP was not held at Monza. The Renaults dominated qualifying at this fast Italian circuit, although they fell out with mechanical problems; and Piquet won yet again and overtook Jones in the championship, who finished 2nd in front of his teammate Carlos Reutemann.

===Round 13: Canada===
The final leg of the 1980 Formula One season was a 2-part tour in North America, starting in Canada, at the Ile-Notre Dame circuit in Montreal. This race had to be restarted after a multiple pile-up involving Piquet and Jones at the start, when Jones shut the door at the very first corner after the start. Piquet jumped into the spare car, which had a short-lasting qualifying Ford/Cosworth engine in it – and although Piquet was clearly faster than anyone else, the engine in his Brabham blew up early on, and Jones won the race, which effectively gave the gritty Australian his only ever Formula One Drivers&#x27; Championship, and Williams&#x27;s first ever Constructors&#x27; Championship. Unfortunately, Jabouille&#x27;s weekend was much worse than Piquet&#x27;s: he crashed head on into a tire-wall and broke both his legs.

===Round 14: United States East===
The other half of the North American visit and the last round of the 1980 Formula One season was the second round in the United States at the fast, dauntingly challenging Watkins Glen circuit in New York State, four hours from New York City and only 5 hours from Montreal. This race had been in doubt for almost the whole season, but on this quick, bumpy, demanding and elevated circuit located in the rolling vineyard hills above Seneca Lake, it did go ahead after a loan was given by FOCA to the organizers. French rising star Alain Prost crashed heavily on Saturday morning practice due to suspension failure at the very fast left-handed Turn 10, the second-to-last corner on the track. Prost received a concussion after hitting his head on his car&#x27;s steering wheel; he had to miss the race but was at the circuit on race day; he felt he could not trust the car&#x27;s mechanical strength after a season&#x27;s worth of component failures on his car, which often led to accidents; this happened to Prost a week earlier in Montreal. Bruno Giacomelli took pole in his Alfa, the first time an Alfa Romeo had been on pole since 1951. Giacomelli made a perfect start and led for most of this exciting race up until Lap 32, when the electrics in his Alfa failed in the Boot section of the course. Jones, however, produced a storming drive, when he went off at the first corner at the start and dropped to 16th; he stormed through and took 2nd from his Argentine teammate Carlos Reutemann, and then inherited the lead from Giacomelli after the Italian retired. The Australian Jones won his 5th race of the year (6 if Spain is counted) ahead of Reutemann and Didier Pironi in a Ligier. 1978 champion Mario Andretti scored his only point of the 1980 season at Watkins Glen, close to his adoptive town in Nazareth, Pennsylvania (he born in 1940 in current city of Motovun, Croatia, at the time called &quot;Montona&quot; and being part of the Kingdom of Italy, and emigrated to Nazareth with his family in 1955). Unfortunately, this was to be the last championship Formula One race at the rather isolated Watkins Glen circuit. The corporation running the circuit was heavily in debt and went bankrupt after it could not meet Bernie Ecclestone and FOCA&#x27;s increased demands, and the circuit was struck from the 1981 season calendar in May of that year and although there were other Grands Prix that would be run in the United States during the 1980s aside from Long Beach, the United States Grand Prix would not be run again until 1989 on a street circuit in Phoenix, Arizona- and not one of those venues saw the success and longevity that this event had at Watkins Glen.

A third American race, the Caesars Palace Grand Prix in Las Vegas was supposed to be the final event of the season 4 weeks after Watkins Glen but this event was cancelled.

<text>Voigtländer () was a significant long-established company within the optics and photographic industry, headquartered in Braunschweig, Germany, and today continues as a trademark for a range of photographic products.

== History ==
Voigtländer was founded in Vienna, Archduchy of Austria, in 1756, by . Voigtländer produced mathematical instruments, precision mechanical products, optical instruments, including optical measuring instruments and opera glasses, and is the oldest name in cameras.

=== Early beginnings ===
Johann Christoph Voigtländer (November 19, 1732 in Leipzig – June 27, 1797 in Vienna), the son of a carpenter, came to Prague in 1755, and to Vienna in the same year, and worked from 1757 to 1762 in the workshop of Meinicke, who produced mathematical instruments.

Through Johann Voigtländer&#x27;s skilful achievements, the Minister of State of the Habsburg monarchy—Prince Wenzel von Kaunitz, drew attention to Voigtländer and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria granted Voigtländer in 1763 a so-called trade &quot;Protection Decree&quot; (German &quot;Schutzdekret/Schutzdecret&quot;): &quot;on the making of mathematical instruments and on an unspecified number of workers&quot;, upon which Voigtländer founded his own workshop and whereby he could sell his products relatively unrivalled.

In 1767, Voigtländer invented two important tools: a linear device for natural and tapered gauges, and a circular device for elevation, astrolabe, and cartography etc., including, a screw cutting machine, a metal lathe and finishing rollers for sheep wool and silk factories. The production program was supplemented by compasses, tweezers, levelling devices, dioptres and other fine mechanical products.

In recognition of his achievements and dexterity, Voigtländer received in 1797 a so-called &quot;national commercial license with all advantages and privileges&quot; (German &quot;Landesfabriksbefugnis&quot;); this license awarded Voigtländer under certain circumstances the prestige to display the imperial eagle of the Habsburg monarchy, but above all the right to establish branch sales offices in all major cities of the empire. In the same year, Voigtländer died, and his successful family business was continued by his widow, their three sons and one daughter.
From 1840, Voigtländer&#x27;s grandson established Voigtländer as a leading photographic company of its time on introducing and producing the Petzval objective lens.

=== Photography optics and cameras ===
From 1839, the year, when the invention of photography was being published, came objective optics and from 1840 complete cameras for photography. The Voigtländer objectives were revolutionary because they were the first mathematically calculated precision objectives in the history of photography, developed by the Austro-Hungarian/Slovak mathematics professor Josef Maximilian Petzval, with technical advice provided by Peter Voigtländer. Voigtländer went on to produce the first Petzval portrait photographic lens (the fastest lens at that time: f/3.6) in 1840, and the world&#x27;s first all-metal daguerreotype camera (&quot;Ganzmetallkamera&quot;) in 1840, also bringing out photographic plate cameras shortly afterwards. An original of the 1840 all-metal daguerreotype camera with &quot;No. 84 Voigtländer &amp; Sohn in Vienna&quot; is exhibited in the &quot;Deutsches Museum&quot; in Munich.

In 1845, Peter Voigtländer married the daughter of a respected Braunschweig lawyer, whom he had met on one of his photographic sale journeys in Braunschweig. Voigtländer had previously set up a branch sales office in Braunschweig, Duchy of Brunswick, at that time the central hub in the German rail network. Compared to Vienna, Braunschweig offered a location advantage regarding the distribution of Voigtländer objectives and daguerreotype camera products due to the greater proximity to the German overseas ports.

During the rising social and political tensions in the Austrian Empire leading to the Revolutions of 1848, Peter Voigtländer had joined the political cause of the Democrats and also became adjutant to the commander of the Vienna national civil guard—General . As the revolutions escalated during the Vienna Uprising of October 1848, the counter-revolution had strengthened with full force, and General Messenhauser of the revolting national civil guard, like many others—were executed. Voigtländer at that time had in perception of the power relations withdrawn from the Vienna national civil guard and with his family took refuge in a suburb of Vienna. On the wishes of Peter Voigtländer&#x27;s wife and when the March revolutions of 1848 hindered the further development of the young photographic company, the family promptly re-located from Vienna to his wife&#x27;s hometown Braunschweig, where from 1849 Voigtländer established a subsidiary production site, granted on a provisional &quot;Concession for the pursuit of a trade&quot;, issued by the city directorate with a term of five years. In September 1852, Peter Voigtländer was successfully awarded a so-called &quot;land-cooperative&quot; (German &quot;Markgenossenschaft&quot;) and issued the desired unrestricted &quot;Concession for the pursuit of a trade&quot; in the city Braunschweig. In 1864, Peter Voigtländer was honoured by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria with the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph; becoming known as Peter Wilhelm Friedrich Ritter von Voigtländer. On the death of Voigtländer&#x27;s Vienna works manager, the Vienna business was closed in 1868.

===Public corporation===
Voigtländer Braunschweig changed status to a public &quot;Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (Voigtländer &amp; Sohn AG) in 1898. In 1923 a majority of the shares (99.7%) were acquired by Schering AG&#x27;s photo division and large-scale production then took place in 1925.
Over the next three decades, Voigtländer became a technology leader and the first manufacturer to introduce several new photographic products that later became commonplace. These include the first zoom lens for 35 mm still photography (36–82/2.8 &quot;Zoomar&quot;) in 1959 and the first 35 mm compact camera with built-in electronic flash (Vitrona) in 1965.

Schering sold its share of the company to the Carl Zeiss Foundation in 1956, and &quot;Zeiss-Ikon&quot; and &quot;Voigtländer-Vertriebsgesellschaft&quot; integrated in 1965. Due to falling sales, on 4 August 1971 &quot;Zeiss-Ikon/Voigtländer-Vertriebsgesellschaft&quot; ceased camera production and closed the Voigtländer factory, which employed at the time 2,037 persons. Subsequently, the company was reorganized as the collective enterprise &quot;Optische Werke Voigtländer&quot; (Optical Works Voigtländer), in which Carl Zeiss AG, the state of Lower Saxony and the Braunschweig camera manufacturer Rollei each took an equal one-third share; in 1974, Rollei took over all the shares. On the collapse of Rollei in 1982, Plusfoto took over the name, selling it in 1997 to Ringfoto.

=== Current Status ===
Since 1999, Voigtländer-branded products have been manufactured and marketed by the Japanese optics and camera company Cosina, under license from Ringfoto GmbH &amp; Co. ALFO Marketing KG; for these, see Cosina Voigtländer.

== Lenses ==

Original Voigtländer lens designs can be divided roughly between pre-war designs, which date back to a series of lenses developed by Dr. Hans Harting as Cooke triplet and &quot;Tessar&quot; derivatives at around the start of the 20th century, and post-war designs, which largely are credited to Dr. Albrecht Tronnier.

The pre-war designs include:
* &quot;Heliar&quot;, designed by Dr. Hans Harting originally in 1902 as a symmetric design derived from the &quot;Cooke triplet&quot; with five elements in three groups consisting of two cemented doublets flanking a central bi-concave element, followed quickly by an improved asymmetric design. The Heliar was made over many years, and was usually a 5 element lens, the 75 mm versions were of a 6 element design. The 125 mm version actually had 11 elements.
** &quot;Dynar&quot; was a similar five-element, three-group lens designed by Harting in 1904, but the cemented doublets were reversed compared to the original &quot;Heliar&quot;; this design was later renamed &quot;Heliar&quot;. Robert Richter designed several improved versions of the &quot;Heliar&quot; in the 1920s.
** &quot;Tele-Dynar&quot;, another five-element, three-group design similar to the &quot;Heliar&quot;
** &quot;Apo Lanthar&quot;, designed by Tronnier in 1949 which shared lens geometries with the improved &quot;Heliar&quot; that Tronnier developed at the same time. Most are slightly radioactive; the &quot;Lanthar&quot; name refers to the lanthanum oxide-doped glass used in its construction, which often included thorium dioxide.
* &quot;Voigtar&quot;, a three-element Cooke Triplet derivative
** Similar post-war triplet designs include the &quot;Vaskar&quot; and &quot;Color-Lanthar&quot;
* &quot;Skopar&quot;, a 4-element, 3-group &quot;Tessar&quot; type lens.
** Improved &quot;Skopar&quot; designs were sold as &quot;Skoparex&quot;, &quot;Skoparet&quot;, &quot;Skopagon&quot;, &quot;Color-Skopar&quot;, and &quot;Color-Skopar X&quot;.
* &quot;Heliostigmat&quot;, a reversed &quot;Tessar&quot;
* &quot;Radiar&quot;, a &quot;Dialyte&quot;

Tronnier, who previously had designed several lenses for Schneider Kreuznach, joined Voigtländer as a consultant in 1944 and is credited with several important post-war improvements and original designs, including:
* &quot;Ultron&quot;, a fast asymmetric double Gauss normal lens comparable to the Leitz &quot;Summicron&quot; and Zeiss &quot;Planar&quot; designs. This later was reformulated in 1968 with a concave front element for the Icarex cameras, credited as a Carl Zeiss lens after that company had acquired Voigtländer in 1956.
* &quot;Nokton&quot;, the fastest asymmetric double Gauss lens offered by Voigtländer, comparable to Ludwig Bertele&#x27;s &quot;Ernostar&quot;, the Leitz &quot;Summilux&quot;, and Zeiss &quot;Sonnar&quot;.
* &quot;Ultragon&quot;, an asymmetric design coupling the front half of a &quot;Topogon&quot; with the rear half of a double Gauss design.
* &quot;Telomar&quot;, a telephoto derived from the &quot;Heliar&quot;.
* &quot;Skoparon&quot;, an inverted telephoto wide-angle lens design for SLR cameras incorporating the &quot;Skopar&quot;.

Additional post-war lenses include:
* &quot;Helomar&quot;
* Dynarex, Dynaret, Color-Dynarex, Super-Dynarex, Super-Dynaret, telephoto lenses
* Septon, comparable to the &quot;Ultron&quot;

In addition, Voigtländer offered the &quot;Zoomar&quot; with its Bessamatic starting from 1959. The &quot;Zoomar&quot; was designed by Frank G. Back of Zoomar U.S.A and manufactured by Kilfitt in Munich; it is usually reckoned to be the first zoom lens specifically designed for a 35 mm &quot;still&quot; camera.

<doc id="1140080" wikidata="Q69415" url="?curid=1140080" title="1979 Formula One season">
<text>The 1979 Formula One season was the 33rd season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1979 &quot;World Championship of F1 Drivers&quot; and the 1979 &quot;International Cup for F1 Constructors&quot; which were contested concurrently over a fifteen-round series which commenced on 21 January 1979, and ended on 7 October 1979. The season also included three non-championship Formula One races.

Jody Scheckter won the Drivers&#x27; Championship and, with teammate Gilles Villeneuve in second place, Ferrari won the Constructors&#x27; Championship. This was the team&#x27;s fourth Constructors&#x27; Championship in five years, and more would follow, but it would be their last Drivers&#x27; Championship for the next 21 years.

This was the final season for 1976 F1 world champion James Hunt.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following drivers and constructors contested the 1979 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the 1979 International Cup for F1 Constructors.

===Team and driver changes===
Several high-profile changes happened among the leading teams for this season, as the death of Swedish driver Ronnie Peterson the previous September precipitated a merry-go-round of some of the most highly regarded drivers on the grid:

* Reigning champions Team Lotus signed Carlos Reutemann from Ferrari to replace Peterson. Ferrari took on Jody Scheckter to fill the gap, and the Wolf team hired James Hunt in his place.
* McLaren had originally signed Peterson to replace Hunt but when Peterson was killed, fellow British contender John Watson was signed instead. His place at Brabham was taken by the highly regarded but inexperienced Nelson Piquet, who had driven for them at the final race of last season.
* Tyrrell attracted ex-Lotus driver Jean-Pierre Jarier instead of Patrick Depailler, who moved to Ligier. The French team had acquired Matra&#x27;s assets for their entrance in Formula 1, but lost their factory support before the 1979 season. They secured a deal for Ford-Cosworth engines, just like the majority of teams.
* Clay Regazzoni moved from Shadow to Williams, while René Arnoux moved to Renault for his second season. Both teams expanded their operations to two cars for the first time.
* Hans-Joachim Stuck had moved to ATS, so Shadow had two open seats. They signed Jan Lammers and Elio de Angelis, both making their F1 debuts.
* Arrows replaced Rolf Stommelen with Jochen Mass.

====Mid-season changes====
* Following a string of races in which he failed to finish, James Hunt retired from driving halfway through the season to join BBC Sport as a commentator. His seat was taken by future champion Keke Rosberg.
* Patrick Depailler suffered a hang gliding accident in June and broke both legs. Ligier, who were supported by the French government, were forced to find a French replacement driver, which they found in French-speaking Belgian Jacky Ickx. It was Ickx&#x27;s last F1 drive.
* Derek Daly was let go by the Ensign team and replaced by debutant Patrick Gaillard, who did not provide better results. Finally, Formula Two champion Marc Surer picked up the drive. He did not deliver, but for him, it was a good entry into the sport and he would eventually spend eight years in F1.
* After driving a privatised Lotus 79, Héctor Rebaque debuted with his self-made chassis, the Rebaque HR100 in the Italian Grand Prix.
* In , Alfa Romeo returned to F1 as engine supplier to Brabham, but designer Carlo Chiti persuaded the manufacturer to develop their own chassis. The Alfa Romeo 177 made its debut at the 1979 Belgian Grand Prix. They quit the supply deal with Brabham, leaving them to switch to Ford-Cosworth V8&#x27;s with two races to go in the year. According to Niki Lauda, this was not a step forward: during the first practice session with the V8, the Austrian suddenly retired the car and quit the team, as he had no more desire to &quot;continue the silliness of driving around in circles&quot;. Test driver Ricardo Zunino took his place.
* Fittipaldi expanded to two cars with two races to go in the season.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved up six weeks, ahead of the Belgian and Monaco Grand Prix. Those two races also swapped places compared to .
* The Swedish Grand Prix was originally scheduled to be held on 17 June at Anderstorp Raceway, but was cancelled as enthusiasm for Formula One in Sweden had faded as a result of the deaths of Swedish drivers Ronnie Peterson and Gunnar Nilsson. There was never another Swedish Grand Prix.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Paul Ricard Circuit to Dijon-Prenois, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone.
* The United States Grand Prix and Canadian Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar. The race at Watkins Glen now hosted the season finale.

==Regulation changes==
* The cockpit opening was to be made bigger.
* It was stipulated for the first time that an F1 car had to have two rear-view mirrors.

==Season report==
===Pre-season===
The domination of the Lotus 79 meant that all the teams had to build new &quot;ground-effect&quot; cars for the 1979 season. Team Lotus, aiming to stay one step ahead, was designing the new Lotus 80. Cigarette maker John Player Special withdrew from F1 and Olympus moved to Wolf and Lotus landed a new sponsorship package with Martini, Tissot and Essex Petroleum. Mario Andretti was retained and Carlos Reutemann had been signed to drive even before Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s death at Monza. Peterson had signed a deal to join McLaren, to replace James Hunt. After Peterson was killed McLaren turned to John Watson, who was out of work having been dropped by Brabham. The McLaren team produced a new McLaren M28 for Watson and Patrick Tambay to drive. Hunt had received a huge offer to drive for Wolf Racing with Harvey Postlethwaite designing a new WR7. Jody Scheckter had joined Gilles Villeneuve at Ferrari and the team produced the ungainly 312T4, which was handicapped aerodynamically by the flat-12 engine, which made ground-effect difficult. The engine was however very powerful.

Ligier expanded to two cars with Patrick Depailler being hired from Tyrrell to partner Jacques Laffite. The team gave up with the old Matra engine and ran Cosworths instead and Gerard Ducarouge designed the JS11. Williams also expanded to two cars and signed Clay Regazzoni to partner Alan Jones while Patrick Head finished off the new FW07 design. Also expanding was Renault Sport which hired Rene Arnoux to partner Jean-Pierre Jabouille. The pair started the year with the old RS1 while the new RS10 was finished. Brabham had a new Alfa Romeo V12 engine and Niki Lauda was joined by rising star Nelson Piquet in the Parmalat-sponsored team. Tyrrell was struggling for money as Elf had decided to put its money behind Renault and First National City Travelers Checks had decided not to continue. The team had hired Jean-Pierre Jarier to partner Didier Pironi and Maurice Philippe designed a new 008 chassis. Arrows hired Jochen Mass to partner Riccardo Patrese and continued with the A1 chassis, although the bullet-nosed A2 was under development. ATS hired Hans Stuck to drive its new D3 chassis while Ensign had Derek Daly, Fittipaldi continued with his own car while Shadow was left without any drivers and so hired youngsters Elio de Angelis and Jan Lammers to drive. Surtees and Theodore disappeared while Hector Rebaque bought a 1978 Lotus and pushed ahead with his own car. Arturo Merzario was also struggling on with his own design, while Kauhsen and Alfa Romeo were both preparing their own teams.

===Race 1: Argentina===
Like in previous years, the opening race of the season was in Argentina at the Buenos Aires circuit located on the outskirts of the capital city. Most people expected the Lotus cars driven by defending champion Mario Andretti, and his new teammate Carlos Reutemann to dominate but, to many people&#x27;s surprise, it was the Ligier team that dominated qualifying, with Jacques Laffite on pole ahead of Patrick Depailler, leaving home favorite Reutemann to qualify third, with Jarier fourth ahead of Scheckter, Watson, Andretti, Pironi, Tambay and Villeneuve. Laffite led at the start with Depailler following, but the two men starting on the third row, John Watson in the McLaren collided with Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Ferrari at the very fast first 2 corners, creating chaos behind. The resulting accident involved Pironi, Tambay, Piquet, Merzario and Andretti; Piquet was taken to hospital) and the race was red-flagged, and aside from Piquet&#x27;s injury, no one else was injured.

The race restarted after the mess was cleared, and this time Depailler set off into the lead with Jean-Pierre Jarier&#x27;s Tyrrell and Watson (in his spare car) following him. But soon Laffite was up to second, and a few laps later he took the lead from Depailler. The Ligiers drove away, whereas Jarier struggled and dropped down the order with engine troubles, leaving Watson third before he was passed by a recovering Reutemann. Reutemann drove a stirring race in front of his home crowd, but it wasn&#x27;t enough as Laffite went on and won comfortably, but teammate Depailler suffered a misfire and dropped to fourth, leaving Reutemann second and Watson third.

===Race 2: Brazil===
The drivers stayed in South America for the second round which was held in Brazil, returning to the 5-mile Interlagos circuit in São Paulo; the longest circuit on the calendar. The Ligiers were in top form again, Laffite taking pole comfortably with Depailler alongside, with the Lotuses led by Reutemann on the second row.

The second row featured the Lotuses of Carlos Reutemann and Mario Andretti and the third row featured the Ferraris of Gilles Villeneuve and Jody Scheckter. Jean-Pierre Jabouille put his Renault seventh, just ahead of Didier Pironi&#x27;s Tyrrell. The top 10 was completed by Emerson Fittipaldi (Fittipaldi) and James Hunt (Wolf). Brabham was in trouble on this occasion with Niki Lauda down in 12th place and the hobbling Nelson Piquet 22nd.

This time, Laffite was able to lead right from the first corner with Reutemann taking second from Depailler, but Depailler regained the place soon after and Andretti also passed his teammate to take third. Andretti however soon retired with a misfire, and so Reutemann was back in third. In the race Laffite took the lead while Reutemann briefly grabbed second place before Depailler seized it back again. Reutemann lost third place as well as Andretti went past him. Behind them came Scheckter and Fittipaldi. Fittipaldi then overtook Scheckter and moved to fourth when Andretti&#x27;s Lotus began to misfire and went into the pits. Piquet retired from his first home race after losing his front wing in an attempt to overtake Regazzoni, who later also collided with Tambay, eliminating Tambay. Fittipaldi then attacked Reutemann while behind them Scheckter came under pressure from Pironi. Pironi got ahead but then spun and found himself behind again. He repeated the overtaking move and began to pull away from the Ferrari. On the twenty-second lap Fittipaldi&#x27;s fine charge ended when a rear wheel worked itself loose and he had to pit. Both Ferraris pitted for new tires and Villeneuve got ahead and they finished fifth and sixth behind Laffite, Depailler, Reutemann and Pironi. Laffite dominated as he had in Buenos Aires, completing his clean sweep of the South American segment of this Formula One season, although he was pushed by Depailler all the way – Depailler finished 2nd to Laffite to complete a 1–2 for Ligier and Reutemann completing the podium.

===Race 3: South Africa===

There was a four-week break between the Brazilian and South African GPs and the battle for control of the sport between the Formula One Constructors Association and the newly formed FISA under Jean-Marie Balestre was heating up but the South African race went ahead anyway. At the high-altitude Kyalami circuit between Johannesburg and Pretoria, Ferrari debuted their new ground-effect 312T4 to replace the 312T3 at this race, which had been used for the South American rounds; teams often debuted their new cars after the Argentine and Brazilian rounds, although some often debuted their new cars in Argentina, like Ligier, Brabham and Tyrrell. Since the dominant Ligier performances in South America the opposition had been working hard to perfect ground-effect technology. There were no changes in the driver lineup but after practice there was the rather surprising sight of the old non-ground effect Renault RS1 of Jean-Pierre Jabouille on pole position. This was largely due to the extra horsepower the car had at high altitude. Jabouille was ahead of the Ferraris of Scheckter and Villeneuve. Niki Lauda was fourth fastest in the Brabham while the two Ligiers were fifth and sixth, Patrick Depailler setting a faster time than Jacques Laffite. The top 10 was completed by Didier Pironi&#x27;s Tyrrell, Mario Andretti&#x27;s Lotus, Jean-Pierre Jarier&#x27;s Tyrrell and the second Renault of René Arnoux.

It was overcast when the race started but Jabouille stayed ahead of Scheckter and Villeneuve, even banging wheels through the fast Barbecue and Jukskei corners. Within a few moments however a cloudburst resulted in the race being stopped but before that happened Villeneuve had managed to get ahead of Scheckter and Jabouille. As a result, he was on pole for the restart. The weather was still uncertain and several drivers (notably Scheckter, Depailler, Patrick Tambay (McLaren) and Nelson Piquet (Brabham) decided to race on slicks. At the restart Villeneuve was able to build up a lead but as the track dried it became clear that the men who had gambled on slicks were in a much better position and Scheckter took the lead when Villeneuve pitted on lap 15. He rejoined second ahead of Tambay and Piquet. Villeneuve charged after Scheckter. Piquet began to suffer engine trouble and fell behind Jarier and Andretti and a few laps later the pair were also ahead of Tambay. Jabouille then moved back up to fifth with Reutemann and Laffite following him until the Renault engine failed again. With Laffite having spun off because of a puncture, Reutemann moved to fifth.

When the race restarted, most drivers were on wets, but Scheckter and a few others opted for slicks. Villeneuve led at the restart and built up a gap, but the track dried and he had to pit for slicks along with most of the field. This left Scheckter leading comfortably, and he looked well set for a home win until he had to pit for new tyres, handing the lead back to Villeneuve and in behind, Patrick Tambay briefly ran third in his McLaren, until he was passed by Jarier. It was Villeneuve who won the race with Scheckter close behind, and Jarier taking the final spot on the podium. On lap 52 Scheckter pitted for new tires and so Villeneuve took the lead with Scheckter now chasing him. The gap closed to within four seconds at the flag but victory went to Villeneuve, with Scheckter 2nd for a Ferrari 1–2. Jarier was a distant third with Andretti fourth, Reutemann fifth and Lauda sixth. Piquet nursed his car to seventh.

===Race 4: United States West===

Five weeks after the South African race, the field went to the United States to compete at the gruelling Long Beach street circuit near Los Angeles, California. There were no changes in the driver lineup for Long Beach and South African GP winner Gilles Villeneuve took pole position in his 312T4. His former Ferrari teammate Reutemann was second in the Lotus while Scheckter was third quickest ahead of the two Ligiers of Depailler and Laffite. Home favorite Mario Andretti completed the top six in his Lotus while the top 10 was rounded off by Jean-Pierre Jarier&#x27;s Tyrrell, James Hunt (Wolf), Riccardo Patrese (Arrows) and Alan Jones (Williams). The Brabhams were again not very competitive with Niki Lauda 11th and Nelson Piquet 12th while Jan Lammers did a good job to put his Shadow 14th. The McLarens were uncompetitive with John Watson and Patrick Tambay 18th and 19th. It was a disastrous practice for Renault as Arnoux and Jabouille were breaking gearboxes all throughout practice, so the Renault team decided to withdraw their entries on grounds of safety.

The starting procedure was a mess with Reutemann being forced to start from the pits half a lap behind because of an electrical failure. Villeneuve overshot his grid position and decided to lead the field around again. When the grid arrived on the grid for the second time, Laffite&#x27;s car locked up and turned sideways and so Villeneuve led half the field around again, the rest having been stopped by officials. The leaders had to then weave through the backmarkers to take up their positions. Finally the race got underway with Villeneuve taking off into the lead with Depailler holding off Scheckter to grab second. In the process the South African damaged a front wing. Further back in the field Tambay ran into the back of Lammers and was launched through the air and landed on top of Lauda&#x27;s Brabham. Both cars were out.

Villeneuve thus led Depailler, Scheckter and Jarier and Andretti but it was Jarier who was on the move and he soon overtook both Scheckter and Depailler to run second. Depailler then dropped behind Scheckter and the Ferrari driver then attacked Jarier and finally on lap 27 he moved to second place. The two Ferraris were out ahead and interest centered on the battle for third with Jarier under pressure from Depailler, Andretti and Jones. The Williams driver managed to get ahead of Andretti and all three then overtook Jarier and so as the race went into its closing stages Jones was challenging Depailler. On lap 62 he got ahead, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to catch Villeneuve and Scheckter, who finished 1–2. In the closing laps Depailler lost fourth gear and dropped behind Andretti, while Jarier finished sixth.

One week after Long Beach, the Race of Champions at the fast, undulating Brands Hatch circuit in southern England featured another victory for Gilles Villeneuve.

===Race 5: Spain===
After another long break, this time for three weeks, the Spanish Grand Prix was next, at the tight and twisty Jarama circuit near the Spanish capital of Madrid, starting a trilogy of Grands Prix at tight and twisty circuits. Lotus had the new 80 ready for Mario Andretti while Renault had a new RS10 and Williams had a pair of the new FW07s. McLaren had modified the M28 after a disappointing start to the year. The Kauhsen team made its first appearance with driver Gianfranco Brancatelli but the car was a long way off the pace and failed to qualify as did Arturo Merzario in his A2 and Derek Daly in his Ensign. At the front the Ligiers were back on top again with Jacques Laffite taking pole position from Patrick Depailler. Villeneuve was third quickest with Andretti fourth in the new Lotus. Jody Scheckter was fifth in his Ferrari with Niki Lauda and Nelson Piquet sixth and seventh in their improving, but untrustworthy Brabhams. Then came Carlos Reutemann in an old Lotus 79 and the top 10 was rounded off by Jean-Pierre Jabouille in the new Renault and Didier Pironi&#x27;s Tyrrell.

At the start Depailler took the lead from Laffite while Villeneuve tried to challenge the Ligiers and dropped behind the fast-starting Reutemann. Keen to win back his place Villeneuve spun and dropped down the order. Laffite tried to find a way to pass Depailler but eventually missed a gear and blew up his engine. This left Reutemann second with Scheckter third until lap 60 when he dropped behind Lauda. The Austrian then went out with an engine failure, matching Piquet&#x27;s early exit so Scheckter regained the position only to lose it a few laps later to Andretti. So Depailler won ahead of the Lotus pair of Reutemann and Andretti, while Scheckter thus had to settle for fourth place with Jarier fifth and Pironi sixth.

===Race 6: Belgium===
The Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder was 2 weeks after Spain, and the F1 field had grown to 28 cars with the appearance of Bruno Giacomelli in the new Alfa Romeo F1 car, the company&#x27;s first official entry in the World Championship since the end of 1951. This was using the old flat-12 engines while a new car was being built for the new V12, which was being run by the Brabham team. The entry was otherwise unchanged although Tyrrell had managed to find some much-needed sponsorship from Italian domestic appliance maker Candy. Qualifying resulted in the usual story of Ligier domination with Jacques Laffite ahead of Patrick Depailler. Nelson Piquet impressed many by qualifying third in his Brabham while Alan Jones gave the first hint that the Williams FW07 was going to be a competitive car by qualifying fourth. The third row featured Mario Andretti, who had decided to use the old Lotus 79 instead of the new 80 and Gilles Villeneuve in his Ferrari. His teammate Jody Scheckter was on the fourth row, alongside Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Lotus while the top 10 was rounded off by the two Tyrrells of Jean-Pierre Jarier and Didier Pironi. Niki Lauda was 11th in his Brabham and Giacomelli was 12th in the Alfa. At the back of the grid McLaren&#x27;s woes continued with Patrick Tambay failing to qualify an old M26 after John Watson destroyed the difficult M28 in testing.

At the start of the race Depailler went into the lead with Jones grabbing second from Piquet while Laffite dropped to fourth. On the second lap Scheckter collided with Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Williams and Villeneuve was also involved as he snagged the rear wheel of the Williams at the chicane. Both Ferraris were able to keep going by Regazzoni was out. Villeneuve had to pit for a new nose cone. On the fourth lap, Laffite overtook Piquet, while behind them Scheckter was able to get ahead of Andretti and soon afterwards Scheckter also overtook Piquet who was having tyre trouble after a promising start. The order settled for a while and then Laffite slipped ahead of Jones and on lap 19 took the lead. Depailler quickly dropped behind Jones as well and on lap 24 Jones went into the lead. Both Brabhams again expired with engine trouble on lap 23. Jones&#x27;s hopes of victory ended on lap 40 with electrical failure and as Laffite had fallen behind Depailler again it was the second Ligier driver who went back into the lead until lap 47 when he understeered off into the barriers at the first corner and Laffite went back into the lead. Behind him was Scheckter and the Ferrari closed gradually in and on lap 54 went ahead. All this left Reutemann in third place but in the closing laps he was caught and passed by Pironi. So Scheckter won in front of Laffite, Pironi and Reutemann, while Patrese finished fifth with Watson sixth. Villeneuve finished seventh after running out of fuel on the final lap.

===Race 7: Monaco===
The next race was the illustrious Monaco GP, Jody Scheckter&#x27;s victory in Belgium had moved the South African to the top of the standings in the World Championship with 25 points but he was only a point clear of Jacques Laffite with Lotus&#x27;s Carlos Reutemann (21) and Gilles Villeneuve and Patrick Depailler (20 apiece) close behind. The title was wide open. With only 20 starters at Monaco there was a pre-qualifying session for Jochen Mass (Arrows), Hans Stuck (ATS) and Gianfranco Brancatelli (who was standing in for Merzario as he was injured and the Kauhsen team had closed its doors). With Rebaque failing to appear and Alfa Romeo staying at home only one man needed to be weeded out and the Merzario was not a match for the Arrows and the ATS, so Brancatelli went home early. Ferrari seemed to be developing faster than Ligier and the front row featured Jody Scheckter and Gilles Villeneuve in the red cars. Patrick Depailler was third in his Ligier but Niki Lauda (Brabham) was slightly fastest that Jacques Laffite (Ligier) and so took fourth place. Jean-Pierre Jarier (Tyrrell) was sixth fastest with his teammate Didier Pironi matching his time, while Mass was an impressive eighth ahead of Alan Jones (Williams) and James Hunt (Wolf). The two Lotuses were off the pace with Mario Andretti (in the Lotus 80) in 13th and Carlos Reutemann (in an old 79) 11th. McLaren had a new version of the M28 for John Watson and he qualified 14th but Patrick Tambay failed to make it in the earlier version of the car.

At the start Scheckter took the lead with Lauda getting ahead of Villeneuve and Depailler in the run to Ste Devote. Laffite was fifth with Pironi sixth and Jones seventh. On the third lap Villeneuve was able to get ahead of Lauda and set off in pursuit of Scheckter. For the next few laps it was quiet as Villeneuve closed the gap to the leader while Lauda ran third under pressure from Depailler, Laffite, Pironi, Jones and the rest. On lap 16 Pironi ran into the back of Laffite, which forced the Ligier driver into pits. Three laps later Pironi punted Depailler out of the way at the Loews Hairpin. On lap 22 Pironi tried to pass Lauda and the two collided and retired. This left Jones in third place but he survived only until lap 43 when he retired having damaged his steering. As fourth placed Jarier had disappeared with a transmission problem a little earlier Mass found himself third but he was in gearbox trouble and dropped behind Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Williams. On lap 54 Villeneuve&#x27;s race ended with transmission failure and so Scheckter seemed to have everything under control. But in the closing laps Regazzoni closed in dramatically (despite a gearbox problem). At the same time Depailler was closing on Reutemann for third. The last lap provided an exciting battle but Scheckter got to the line first, four-tenths ahead of Regazzoni. Reutemann was third because Depailler&#x27;s engine had blown, so fourth went to Watson with Depailler classified fifth and Mass sixth, although the German driver was seven laps behind.

===Race 8: France===
With the two Swedish drivers in Formula 1 having died (Ronnie Peterson after an accident at Monza and Gunnar Nilsson a few weeks later from cancer), there was no interest and therefore no money for a Swedish GP in 1979 and so there was a 5-week gap between Monaco at the end of May and the French GP at the fast Dijon-Prenois circuit.

The break was used for testing and a lot of the cars were modified. Just after Monaco James Hunt announced that he was quitting F1 and so he was replaced by Keke Rosberg. Patrick Depailler blew all hopes he had of a successful season by breaking both his legs in a hang-gliding accident and so Ligier asked Jacky Ickx to take over its second car. Derek Daly also decided that he was wasting his time with Ensign and went back to Formula Two. Ensign tried to hire Tiff Needell but he was denied a superlicence and so the drive went to Patrick Gaillard. The entry also included Bruno Giacomelli in the Alfa Romeo, Arturo Merzario and Héctor Rebaque. Renault had made a big effort to be competitive in France and the result was that Jean-Pierre Jabouille and won pole with Rene Arnoux second fastest. Then came Gilles Villeneuve (Ferrari) and Nelson Piquet (Brabham). The third row featured World Championship leader Jody Scheckter (Ferrari) and Niki Lauda in the second Brabham while the top 10 was completed by Alan Jones (Williams), Jacques Laffite (Ligier), Clay Regazzoni (Williams) and Jean-Pierre Jarier (Tyrrell). With ATS withdrawing Hans Stuck because of a fight with Goodyear only Gaillard and Merzario failed to qualify.

In the race Villeneuve took the lead with Jabouille second, Scheckter third. Arnoux made a poor start and dropped to ninth. The early part of the race witnessed Arnoux climbing back through the field. By the 10th lap he was fourth and on lap 15 he took third place. At the front Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari began to handle less well and on lap 47 Jabouille moved ahead as Villeneuve fell back towards Arnoux. Piquet blew his chances of a good position soon afterwards by spinning from fourth place (having overtaken Scheckter) and so the place went to Jones.

In the closing laps, a legendary battle between Arnoux and Villeneuve was to take place, cementing this race&#x27;s place in F1 history. Arnoux caught Villeneuve and on lap 78 he went ahead. On the next lap, the penultimate lap, Arnoux&#x27;s engine began to splutter and Villeneuve was back ahead and for the last lap the pair indulged in a wild battle as they ducked and dived and banged wheels. With half a lap to go Arnoux drifted a little wide and Villeneuve was able to go down the inside and secure second place. The two crossed the line just two-tenths of a second apart. Jones was fourth, Jarier fifth and Regazzoni sixth. Renault&#x27;s first victory and the first for a turbocharged engine marked an important turning point in F1 history. The turbocharged engine had become competitive.

===Race 9: Great Britain===
The second half of the year started in Britain at the fastest circuit of the year, the airfield Silverstone circuit 40 miles east of Birmingham. The Williams FW07 had been improving rapidly and new modifications to correct aerodynamic leakage and a new system to keep the skirts touching the ground at all times resulted in the car being fastest in pre-British GP testing. John Watson also had a new McLaren M29, to replace the troublesome M28 and so there was much excitement as the teams gathered at Silverstone just a fortnight after Jean-Pierre Jabouille&#x27;s first victory for Renault at Dijon. The Alfa Romeo team did not appear and so only Hans Stuck (ATS) and Arturo Merzario (in a new Merzario chassis, based on the Kauhsen F1 car) failed to qualify. Alan Jones was very quick in qualifying and took pole position by 0.6sec with Jabouille alongside him. Then came Nelson Piquet (Brabham), Clay Regazzoni in the second Williams, Rene Arnoux (Renault), Niki Lauda (Brabham), Watson, Carlos Reutemann and Mario Andretti (Lotus) and Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier. World Championship leader Jody Scheckter was a disappointing 11th while Elio de Angelis impressed by putting his Shadow 12th on the grid, ahead of Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari and Keke Rosberg in the new Wolf WR9.

At the start Jones went into the lead with Jabouille chasing and the fast-starting Regazzoni third. Piquet ran fourth but soon spun off and so Lauda took the position although he quickly fell behind Arnoux and Villeneuve who had stormed through from the midfield. He was followed by Scheckter. Jabouille&#x27;s challenge faded with his tires and on lap 17 Regazzoni moved to second place and Jabouille then headed for the pits. The stop went wrong he had to pit again and then his engine overheated. This elevated Arnoux to third place with Scheckter fourth and Villeneuve fifth. Jones remained in the lead until lap 39 when he retired with an overheating engine. Regazzoni went into the lead and won to give Frank Williams his first Grand Prix victory. Arnoux finished second with Jean-Pierre Jarier (Tyrrell) climbing through the leaders in the closing stages to take third place, ahead of Watson, the fading Scheckter and Ickx after Laffite and Villeneuve both went out with mechanical troubles.

===Race 10: Germany===
The tenth race of the year was held in Germany, and on the ultra-fast, straight dominated Hockenheim circuit near Stuttgart, where the entry was the same as it had been at Silverstone. Tyrrell&#x27;s Jean-Pierre Jarier was in hospital with a liver problem and so the team had replaced him with Formula 2 driver Geoff Lees. Qualifying resulted in Jean-Pierre Jabouille taking pole for Renault on the fast Hockenheim track but Alan Jones was second in the Williams and Jacques Laffite seemed to be rather off than usual in the Ligier. Nelson Piquet was fourth in his Brabham, ahead of Scheckter, Regazzoni, Lauda, Pironi, Villeneuve, and Arnoux.

In the race Jones took the lead at the start with Jabouille second, Laffite third, Scheckter fourth and Regazzoni fifth. Jones held off intense pressure from Jabouille in the early stages of the race, until the latter tried too hard and spun off giving second to Laffite and third to Regazzoni. Regazzoni was soon past Laffite, and the two Williams cars dominated the rest of race, with Jones getting his first win of the season and Regazzoni completing the 1–2 leaving Laffite to take the final spot on the podium. Regazzoni then closed up on Laffite and went into second place on lap 13. The Williams 1-2 lasted all the way to the finish with Laffite third and Scheckter fourth. For much of the race fifth place belonged to Villeneuve but he had to pit to have a rear wing adjusted and that gave Lauda the position for a brief moment before he suffered engine failure. Piquet then took the place but he too suffered engine failure and so the position went to John Watson (McLaren) with Jochen Mass of Arrows in sixth place, just ahead of Lees.

===Race 11: Austria===
The field went to the very high-speed Österreichring circuit in Austria, and in qualifying once again the Renault turbo was the car to beat, Arnoux taking his first career pole, with Jones forcing Jabouille to settle for the second row. The entry was the same as it had been in Hockenheim but there had been a change at Tyrrell with Derek Daly being brought in to stand-in for the unwell Jean-Pierre Jarier. ATS had undergone a restructuring with former Grand Prix driver Vic Elford becoming team manager and the team had the brand new D2, which had been designed by Nigel Stroud. As the Österreichring is high up in the Austrian Alps, the Renault turbo had an advantage and Rene Arnoux was on pole position with Alan Jones second. Then came Jabouille and Niki Lauda in the fastest of the two Brabham-Alfa Romeos. The third row featured Villeneuve and Regazzoni, and the top 10 was completed by Piquet, Laffite, Scheckter and Pironi.

Villeneuve made a sensational start to take the lead from Jones, Lauda and Arnoux, who made a bad start. Jabouille lost his clutch at the start and dropped to ninth but quickly caught up. Villeneuve stayed ahead until the third lap when Jones breezed ahead, while Arnoux quickly dispensed with Lauda. On lap 11 Arnoux moved to second place but he was then overtaken by Jabouille. The Renault team leader lasted only a couple of laps before the clutch finally stopped him and so Arnoux settled into second place with Villeneuve third, Scheckter fourth, Regazzoni fifth and Laffite sixth. Lauda and Piquet raced behind but yet again the Alfa Romeo engines on both Brabhams failed. Laffite soon moved ahead of Regazzoni and the order then stayed unchanged up front until the closing laps when Arnoux began to have fuel pickup problems in the final laps and had to pit. He dropped to sixth place. On the last lap Laffite overtook Scheckter to grab third place behind Jones and Villeneuve. Scheckter added to his World Championship total with fourth place and the final points went to Regazzoni and Arnoux. Villeneuve led for three laps before Jones passed him, and Arnoux was up to third after passing Lauda. Arnoux then took Villeneuve for second, before Jabouille set off on a charge and took second himself. The two Renaults set off after Jones, but Jabouille&#x27;s gearbox failed. Arnoux continued to chase down Jones until he suffered fuel pressure problems and dropped down to sixth place, and handing second back to Villeneuve. With the Renault challenge finished, Jones was able to cruise to victory with Villeneuve second and Laffite completing the podium.

===Race 12: Holland===
F1 arrived at the beach-side Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam, and the fast Zandvoort circuit had been modified with an awkward chicane placed between both of the most dangerous parts of the track, the very fast Hondenvlak and Tunnel Oost corners. The chicane didn&#x27;t slow down the cars much and the new corner proved to be more of a nuisance than a reduction in danger. Williams was in dominant form, the team having won three successive victories at Silverstone, Hockenheim and at the Österreichring. The scoring system meant that each driver could keep only his four best finishes from each half of the season and as Jones had collected only four points at the midway point he knew that his maximum score for the year would be 40 points. Jody Scheckter had amassed 30 points in the first part of the season and so Jones was not really a threat and the South African had picked up five points and needed only six more to be sure of beating Jones. The threat to Ferrari from Ligier and Lotus had faded completely. Scheckter&#x27;s only real challenge therefore came from his teammate Villeneuve but as he was the Ferrari number two driver, Scheckter&#x27;s position was solid. The only change in the driver lineup was the return to action of Jean-Pierre Jarier after being out of action with hepatitis for two races. In qualifying Arnoux was on pole from Jones, Regazzoni, Jabouille and the two Ferraris, Scheckter ahead of Villeneuve on this occasion. The top 10 was completed by Laffite, Keke Rosberg (Wolf), Lauda and Pironi.

At the start Jones took the lead but Arnoux found himself in a sandwich with Regazzoni on the inside and Jabouille and Villeneuve on the outside. Arnoux thus collided with Regazzoni (the Williams losing its left front wheel) and Arnoux damaging his rear suspension. Thus Jones was followed into the first corner by Villeneuve, Jabouille and Pironi. Scheckter was left behind and started at the very back of the field. Lauda did not last long as he had hurt his wrist in a Procar accident and he was forced to withdraw. While Scheckter charged up through the midfield, the order remained stable at the front although fifth-placed Laffite dropped away early on because of a misfire. Rosberg took over. On lap 11 Villeneuve overtook Jones on the outside at Tarzan Corner to grab the lead and on the next lap Rosberg moved the Wolf ahead of Pironi&#x27;s Tyrrell in fourth place. Pironi later drifted behind Scheckter who then caught and passed Rosberg and profited from Jabouille&#x27;s retirement with a clutch failure.

On lap 47 Villeneuve spun and Jones went back into the lead (despite having gearbox trouble) and four laps later Villeneuve&#x27;s left rear tire exploded and he spun again. He rejoined and drove an entire lap on three wheels. When he got to the pits the suspension was too badly damaged to continue. So Jones won again for Williams while Scheckter finished second and after Pironi went out with a suspension failure third place went to Laffite with Piquet fourth, Jacky Ickx fifth for Ligier and Jochen Mass sixth in his Arrows.

===Race 13: Italy===
The Italian Grand Prix at the very fast Monza Autodrome near Milan was next, and the Milan Auto Club&#x27;s response to driver&#x27;s concerns about the safety and almost total lack of run off at the Monza Park circuit had been responded to, with huge improvements in safety added to the circuit, including new and expansive run off areas at the Lesmos and the Curva Grande, and a new track surface. The field was slightly larger than normal at Monza with the return to the World Championship of Alfa Romeo which fielded a new 179 chassis for Bruno Giacomelli and the old 177 for Vittorio Brambilla, back in action for the first time since the crash at Monza the previous season. Ensign decided to give Formula Two star Marc Surer a run in its car in place of Patrick Gaillard, while Hector Rebaque had his HR100 chassis ready for the first time. In qualifying it was no surprise to see the powerful Renault turbos first and second with Jean-Pierre Jabouille ahead of Rene Arnoux. Then came Scheckter, Jones, Villeneuve, and Regazzoni. The top 10 was completed by Laffite, Piquet and Lauda in the two Brabham-Alfa Romeos and Mario Andretti in the Lotus.

As usual the Renaults were slow off the line and so Scheckter grabbed the lead from Arnoux. Behind then Villeneuve grabbed third while Laffite made a good start to get into fourth place. Jones dropped to the back of the field. On the second lap Arnoux was able to pass Scheckter to take the lead and for the next few laps the five front-runners were nose-to-tail, while Regazzoni ran in a lonely sixth position. On Lap 2 Piquet tangled with Regazzoni and had a huge accident at Curva Grande that tore off the back half of the Brabham. Arnoux&#x27;s lead lasted until lap 13 when Arnoux&#x27;s car began to misfire and he dropped away leaving Scheckter, Villeneuve, Laffite and Jabouille by themselves. Later in the race Jabouille dropped away with engine trouble and Laffite stopped with a similar problem and so third place went to Regazzoni with Lauda, Andretti and Jarier picking up the other points.

This proved to be a memorable day for Ferrari- as Jody Scheckter and Gilles Villeneuve made it a Ferrari 1–2 and with this victory, Scheckter won the Drivers&#x27; Championship and Ferrari won the Constructors&#x27; Championship with a car that proved to have a 100% reliability record thus far – an incredible achievement in 1979. Clay Regazzoni finished 3rd, ahead of Lauda, Andretti and Jarier.

One week after the Italian GP, the non-championship Dino Ferrari Grand Prix at the Imola circuit near Bologna was held, this race was won by Niki Lauda.

===Race 14: Canada===

At the Île Notre-Dame Circuit in Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix, it was Lauda in the news, announcing in the middle of practice that he no longer wanted to be a Formula 1 driver, after completing a few laps in the all-new Brabham-Cosworth BT49. Brabham boss Bernie Ecclestone decided to put Argentina&#x27;s Ricardo Zunino in the car. The other changes to the field were a third Tyrrell for Derek Daly and a second Fittipaldi for Alex Ribeiro. The Alfa Romeo team appeared with two 179 chassis for Bruno Giacomelli and Vittorio Brambilla but the organizers refused to let them practice if they did not pre-qualify and the team refused to pre-qualify. After qualifying Alan Jones (Williams) was on pole position with local hero Gilles Villeneuve second in his Ferrari then came Clay Regazzoni (Williams) and Nelson Piquet in one of the new Brabham-Cosworths. Fifth on the grid was Jacques Laffite (Ligier) with Didier Pironi (Tyrrell), Jean-Pierre Jabouille (Renault), Rene Arnoux (Renault), the new World Champion Jody Scheckter (Ferrari) and Mario Andretti (Lotus) completing the top 10. Zunino qualified 19th and Hector Rebaque put his own HR100 chassis 22nd. There were political battles over whether or not Alfa Romeo would be allowed to run and eventually a compromise was reached with Brambilla allowed to run but Giacomelli being refused an entry.

In the race, which turned out to be a classic Villeneuve took the lead at the start with Jones and Regazzoni chasing him. Piquet ran fourth but then moved ahead of Regazzoni to take third. Jones shadowed Villeneuve for the early part of the race and eventually slipped ahead at the hairpin, the two cars banging wheels. Jones was then able to stay ahead and win but Villeneuve was only a second behind him at the finish- it was revealed later by Williams engineer Frank Dernie that Jones&#x27;s car was on the verge of failing right at the end. Piquet ran third until the closing laps when he dropped behind Regazzoni again and retired soon afterwards with a gearbox problem. Scheckter finished fourth with Pironi fifth and John Watson (McLaren) sixth.

===Race 15: United States (East)===
1 week after Canada, the teams traveled 5 hours south into the United States, to the spectacular, bumpy and fast Watkins Glen circuit in rural western New York, 4 hours from New York City. At this race, the last race of the season it saw a field of 30 cars fighting for 24 grid positions. There were no driver changes and after qualifying Alan Jones, winner of four of the previous five races, was on pole position again. The main interest of the event was whether or not Jones would finish runner-up to the new World Champion Jody Scheckter or whether his Ferrari teammate Gilles Villeneuve would be able to hold him off. Second on the grid was Nelson Piquet in the promising new Brabham-Cosworth BT49 which had appeared at the previous race. Villeneuve was third in his Ferrari with Jacques Laffite (Ligier) fourth, Clay Regazzoni (Williams) fifth and Carlos Reutemann (Lotus) sixth. The top 10 was completed by the two Renaults of Rene Arnoux and Jean-Pierre Jabouille, the Brabham of Ricardo Zunino and Didier Pironi&#x27;s Tyrrell.

The area was mostly soaked with rain, and this made conditions treacherous. On Saturday, during one of the periods when it stopped raining and the track dried out, Jones took pole again from Nelson Piquet in the new Brabham BT49 in his first ever visit to Watkins Glen. Come race day, it started to rain and become windy 20 minutes before the start of the race. At the start, Villeneuve, 3rd on the grid blasted through to take the lead at the first corner. Bruno Giacomelli crashed at Turn 9 and then Jacky Ickx, in his last F1 Grand Prix in a career stretching back to 1967 with 8 Grand Prix victories spun off on Lap 3 and his teammate Laffite compounded Ligier&#x27;s misery by also spinning off on Lap 4 at the fast Turn 11. The race itself was another battle between Villeneuve and Jones, with the Canadian out in front. Once Jones came in to change to dry tires, Jones left the pit lane too fast before one of the mechanics had put the left rear tire on properly; he only made it between Turns 7 and 8 before the wheel came off and he had to retire. This left Villeneuve with no problems at all and he went on to win his 3rd GP of the year in front of Frenchmen Arnoux and Didier Pironi in a Tyrrell.

==Results and standings==
=== Grands Prix ===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. For the first time, the International Cup for F1 Constructors counted the points of all drivers for a constructor. For the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, the best four results from rounds 1-7 and the best four results from rounds 8-15 were counted, while, for the Cup, all rounds were counted.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===
===International Cup for F1 Constructors standings===

==Non-championship races==
Three other Formula One races, which did not count towards the World Championship of Drivers or the International Cup for F1 Constructors, were also held in 1979.

<text>The 1978 Formula One season was the 32nd season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1978 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the International Cup for F1 Constructors, contested concurrently over a sixteen race series which commenced on 15 January and ended on 8 October. The season also included the non-championship BRDC International Trophy.

Mario Andretti won the Drivers&#x27; World Championship, driving for JPS-Lotus. He remains the last American driver to win the World Championship. His victory at the Dutch Grand Prix is also the last for an American driver. Ronnie Peterson was awarded second place in the Drivers&#x27; standings posthumously, having died from medical complications after an accident at Monza during the Italian Grand Prix. Lotus won the International Cup for F1 Constructors, for the last time.

Championship defendants Niki Lauda and Ferrari had parted ways late in , and both parties struggled to repeat the successes they had enjoyed the previous seasons. Carlos Reutemann finished third in the championship in the lead Ferrari, while Lauda finished fourth with Brabham. Apart from Peterson&#x27;s death, the year saw another tragedy when Peterson&#x27;s Swedish compatriot Gunnar Nilsson died from cancer, having been forced to cut his career short after the previous season because of the disease.

* Lauda replaced Hans-Joachim Stuck at Brabham, who subsequently moved to Shadow. He would join Alan Jones, were it not for the Australian&#x27;s new contract with Williams. Williams would enter their first self-made chassis for 1978.
* Clay Regazzoni moved to Shadow from Ensign, while his 1977 teammate Patrick Tambay was signed by McLaren. This left Ensign in a search for two new drivers and they found Danny Ongais from the folded Penske team and the inexperienced Lamberto Leoni. Ex-McLaren driver Jochen Mass found a seat at ATS, built on the remains of Penske and March.
* Ronnie Peterson made a surprising switch to Lotus, replacing fellow Swede Gunnar Nilsson. Peterson&#x27;s seat at Tyrrell was filled by debutant Didier Pironi. Nilsson signed with newcomer Arrows, but was diagnosed with terminal testicular cancer and retired before the season started. Ex-Shadow driver Riccardo Patrese and veteran Rolf Stommelen eventually drove for Arrows.
* Three teams (besides Williams and Arrows mentioned above) debuted with their self-made chassis: Martini, Merzario and Theodore. BRM had folded.

====Mid-season changes====
* Eddie Cheever&#x27;s debut with the Theodore team turned out to be preliminary and he returned to Formula Two. His seat was taken by future champion Keke Rosberg, until he moved to ATS. When Theodore retired their self-made chassis in favour of a private Wolf chassis, Rosberg returned, yet ended the season with ATS.
* Bruno Giacomelli drove a third McLaren car whenever his schedule allowed. He went to become the 1978 Formula Two champion.
* Hesketh Racing folded after six races.
* When the Martini team folded with three races to go, their driver René Arnoux found a new home at Surtees.
* At the start of the Italian Grand Prix, James Hunt tried to avoid Riccardo Patrese and collided with Ronnie Peterson. In the ensuing melee, eight other drivers crashed, Peterson&#x27;s Lotus went hard into the barriers and caught fire. He was rescued from the wreck with minor burns but severe leg injuries. That night in hospital, he was diagnosed with fat embolism, and a subsequent kidney failure was fatal. In the crash, Vittorio Brambilla had been hit in the head by a tyre and sat unconscious in his car. He recovered to return to Formula 1 a full year later. Jean-Pierre Jarier took the seat at Lotus, Beppe Gabbiani fell in at Surtees.
* Nelson Piquet entered the last race of the season in a third Brabham car, before his full-season debut in 1979.

==Calendar==
=== Calendar changes ===
* The Brazilian Grand Prix was moved from Autodromo de Interlagos in São Paulo to Jacarepaguá in Rio de Janeiro for 1978.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from early May to early June.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Dijon-Prenois to Paul Ricard Circuit, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch.
* The Canadian Grand Prix was moved from Mosport Park to the Île Notre-Dame Circuit because of track safety and organization problems with the hilly and scenic Mosport Park track.
* The Japanese Grand Prix was originally scheduled on 16 April at the Suzuka Circuit after Fuji&#x27;s contract was torn up, but it was cancelled for safety and financial reasons.

==Season report==
The 1978 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the International Cup for F1 Constructors were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series.

===Race 1: Argentina===
The 1978 season started at the varied Parque Almirante Brown circuit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Mario Andretti took pole in his Lotus, with home favourite Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Ferrari joining him on the front row and Ronnie Peterson in the other Lotus third on the grid. The start was uneventful, with Andretti and Reutemann easily keeping first and second, with John Watson in the Brabham taking third from Peterson. Watson took second from Reutemann on the seventh lap, but Andretti was uncatchable. Reutemann ran third for a while but then began to drop down the order due to tire problems, so reigning world champion Niki Lauda took third in his Brabham, which became second with ten laps left when Watson&#x27;s engine blew up. Andretti motored on to a crushing victory, with Lauda second and Patrick Depailler&#x27;s Tyrrell taking the final spot on the podium. This had been an unusual Argentine Grand Prix- although the summer weather had been usually hot (although not as hot as the previous year), the attrition rate hadn&#x27;t been as high, nor had the polesitter retired.

===Race 2: Brazil===
Brazil was the country where the drivers traveled for the second round of the season. Formula One made its first visit to the new Jacarepagua Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro, after six years at the very bumpy and demanding Interlagos circuit in São Paulo – the Jacarepagua circuit was to be visited by Formula One for the rest of the next decade. The typically extreme weather during January in Rio meant that this race was run in oppressively hot and humid conditions. Peterson took pole with James Hunt driving for McLaren beating Andretti to second. At the start, Reutemann beat the trio into the first corner, with Hunt and Andretti following, as Peterson got a bad start. Hunt ran second until he had to pit for tyres, as a result, Andretti took the place until late in the race when he suffered gearbox issues, which handed second to Fittipaldi and third to Lauda. Hunt eventually spun out of the race after being caught out by the hot and humid conditions on lap 26, as did Tambay on lap 35 and Villeneuve one lap later. Reutemann was never headed at the front and went to win comfortably, with double world champion Emerson Fittipaldi in his brother&#x27;s team finishing second, and Lauda third, with both overhauling an ailing Andretti towards the end, who eventually finished 4th ahead of Regazzoni and Pironi who rounded out the top 6.

===Race 3: South Africa===
After a long break, the season resumed at the Kyalami circuit in South Africa for the 300th World Championship Grand Prix, where defending champion Lauda took his first pole for Brabham with Andretti alongside and Hunt next. Andretti took the lead at the start, and set about building a gap, whereas Lauda dropped behind Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Wolf. Young Italian Riccardo Patrese was on a charge in the Arrows, passing Lauda for third after 20 laps. As the race continued, both Andretti and Scheckter began to suffer from tyre issues and were passed by Patrese. Depailler was up to second ahead of Lauda, but the latter&#x27;s engine failed, handing third to Andretti. Patrese, however, seemed to have the race in his pocket until his engine failed, and Depailler took the lead, but his Tyrrell began to trail smoke. Andretti was up to second, but he had to pit for fuel, and thus his teammate Peterson took the place before catching and passing Depailler on the last lap to win after some wheel-banging. Watson completed the podium.

===Race 4: United States West===

The next race was in the famous Long Beach circuit near Los Angeles in the American state of California. The Ferraris dominated qualifying, with Reutemann taking pole ahead of teammate Gilles Villeneuve, with defending champion Lauda and home hero Andretti on the second row. When the race started, Watson in fifth late-braked all into turn one, though he ran wide and Villeneuve took the lead, whereas Reutemann dropped down to fourth behind Lauda. The Ferraris, with the two Brabhams in between, ran together until Watson&#x27;s engine failed. Alan Jones&#x27;s Williams was up to fourth and closed in on the now lead trio, which became a duo when Lauda went out with an electrical failure. Villeneuve and Reutemann ran 1–2, with Jones putting both under pressure before Villeneuve also retired after colliding with a backmarker. Jones suffered from fuel pressure problems and began to drop back, handing second to Andretti, to the fans&#x27; delight. The rest of the race passed without incident, and with all challengers out of contention, Reutemann won comfortably ahead of Andretti and Depailler.

===Race 5: Monaco===
Round Five took place in Monaco after an extended gap once the Japanese Grand Prix at the Suzuka circuit was cancelled. Once again, Reutemann started on pole with the Brabham duo of Watson and Lauda second and third. Watson had a good start and led into the first corner, whereas Reutemann collided with Hunt and had to pit for repairs, which left Depailler and Lauda second and third. For the first half of the race, the top three remained the same until Watson had an off allowing Depailler and Lauda through, but the latter then suffered a puncture and had to pit for tyres before charging back up and retaking second from Watson towards the end of the race. At the front, Depailler took his first career victory, with Lauda second and Scheckter third after Watson made another mistake in the final laps.

===Race 6: Belgium===
The main news before the Belgian GP at Zolder was that the new Lotus 79 was ready to race, and immediately Andretti showed its pace by taking pole comfortably from Reutemann and Lauda. He converted it to a first-corner lead, whereas Reutemann had a bad start and got swamped by the field, causing a chain reaction in which Lauda was hit by Scheckter and had to retire. This left Villeneuve second and Peterson third, but neither could keep pace with Andretti, who was able to drive away.

The first 40 laps went without incident until Villeneuve suffered a puncture and had to pit, which dropped him back down to fifth. A few laps later, Peterson also pitted for new tyres leaving the charging Reutemann second ahead of Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier. Peterson, on the new tyres, was much quicker and could pass them both in the closing stages, and Laffite attempted to pass Reutemann on the last lap, but they collided, and Laffite was out. Andretti cruised to an untroubled victory, with Peterson making it a Lotus 1–2 and Reutemann completing the podium.

===Race 7: Spain===
The next race was at the tight, twisty Jarama circuit near Madrid in Spain. Once again, the new Lotus 79 demonstrated its speed, with Andretti on pole again with Peterson alongside, and Reutemann had to settle for the second row. It was Hunt who got a great start and led into the first corner from Andretti and Reutemann, with Peterson dropping back to ninth. Hunt led for seven laps before Andretti passed him and pulled away. Reutemann ran third until he had to pit for tyres, so Watson inherited third until Laffite passed him, but soon the recovering Peterson passed both of them. Hunt now suffered from tyre problems, and he also began to drop back, and so Peterson was able to take second and Laffite third. That was how it ended: Andretti won over Peterson in another Lotus 1–2, and Laffite got the final spot on the podium.

===Race 8: Sweden===
Before the Swedish GP at the isolated Anderstorp circuit, the Brabham team had developed a new &quot;fan car&quot; much to the anger of the other teams, but the FIA allowed it to race. However, it did not stop Andretti from continuing his pole run, but it got Watson to qualify second and Lauda third- while running on full fuel tanks. When the race started, Andretti led into the first corner, with Lauda getting second from his teammate. Riccardo Patrese got up to third in his Arrows until home driver Peterson passed him, but by then, Andretti and Lauda had escaped. Peterson struggled with a slow puncture, whereas Andretti and Lauda battled, with Andretti making a mistake just after mid-distance, allowing Lauda to take the lead. Lauda went on to win the race, his first for Brabham after Andretti&#x27;s challenge ended due to an engine failure, which left Patrese and Peterson to take second and third. This was the last Swedish Grand Prix to date-with the deaths of Ronnie Peterson and Gunnar Nilsson, Swedish interest faded in Formula One, and there was no money for the race to be held.

===Race 9: France===
Brabham was forced to revert to their previous car, but it did not deter them, with Watson on pole and Lauda starting third behind Andretti. At the start, Watson led into the first corner, with Andretti following and Patrick Tambay putting his McLaren in third, but that order did not remain for long as Andretti took the lead from Watson on the first lap. Lauda and Peterson were also on the move as they passed Watson and Tambay to jump into second and third, but Lauda suffered another engine failure. This left the two Lotus cars running 1–2, and they finished like that, with Andretti taking his third win in four races, and the podium was completed by Hunt, who passed Watson mid-race.

===Race 10: Great Britain===
The field went to Britain for the next round, and this time it was Peterson who beat Andretti to pole, as Lotus took the front row, with Scheckter next up on the second row. Andretti took the lead at the start from Peterson, and the two Lotus cars quickly pulled out a gap until Peterson retired with an engine failure. Andretti had a big lead to Scheckter and continued to extend it until he had to pit with a puncture, and he eventually retired when his engine also failed. Scheckter inherited the lead, but Lauda put him under pressure and took the lead before Scheckter went out with gearbox problems. This put Reutemann up to second, closing down and passing Lauda in the late stages of the race to win. Lauda had to settle for second, and his teammate Watson took a podium in his home race.

===Race 11: West Germany===
The West German race was next on the calendar, and there were no surprises in qualifying, with Andretti on pole and Peterson alongside him, with Lauda third. At the start, Peterson got off better and took the lead from Andretti, but he held it for only four laps before Andretti retook it. Lauda ran third in the early stages, but Alan Jones passed him, and the duo battled until Lauda&#x27;s engine failed yet again. The two Lotus cars were cruising at the front, and Jones ran third comfortably until he retired with a fuel vaporization problem. Lotus&#x27;s hopes of a 1–2 ended when Peterson&#x27;s gearbox failed, but Andretti was unaffected by that and cruised to his fifth win of the season, with Scheckter second and Laffite third.

===Race 12: Austria===
The crowds for the Austrian GP were full of Lauda fans; however, for them, Lauda qualified only 12th as the Lotus cars again took the front row, with Peterson on pole. The surprise in qualifying was Jean-Pierre Jabouille, who qualified his turbocharged Renault third. The start saw Peterson lead into the first corner, with Reutemann snatching second from Andretti. Andretti tried to get the place back later in the lap, but the two collided, and Andretti retired after his car spun into the barriers while Reutemann lost a couple of places to Patrick Depailler and Scheckter. On the fourth lap, a heavy rainshower hit the track, and Reutemann spun off and was beached, but the marshals push-started his car as it was in a dangerous position, while Scheckter crashed out, and the race was stopped.

The race restarted after the rain relented, and once again, Peterson led, followed by Depailler and Lauda. As the track began to dry, Peterson started to pull away, and behind, Reutemann was on a charge and passed Lauda for third. Still, he was black-flagged for receiving outside assistance, and Lauda crashed out soon after, leaving Gilles Villeneuve third. The drivers changed to slicks, but the top 3 remained the same until the end; Peterson won ahead of Depailler, with Villeneuve taking his first-ever podium.

===Race 13: The Netherlands===
The drivers went to the Netherlands for the next race, qualifying as expected, Andretti taking pole with Peterson alongside in the all-Lotus front row and Lauda heading the second row. At the start, Andretti led with Peterson following, whereas Jacques Laffite challenged Lauda. The Lotus cars quickly built up a good gap, while Laffite challenged Lauda early on but then began to drop down the order with tyre issues. The race was relatively uneventful, and Andretti went to take victory, with Peterson completing another Lotus 1–2, leaving Lauda to take third.

===Race 14: Italy===
The Italian race was host to round fourteen, and as usual, Andretti took pole with Gilles Villeneuve pleasing the Ferrari fans by qualifying second, ahead of Jabouille&#x27;s turbocharged Renault. When the race started, Andretti and Villeneuve got away comfortably, with Lauda and Jabouille following, but the rest of the field was bunched up.

Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s Arrows overtook many of the cars on the right-hand side of the circuit next to the pitlane since he got a rolling start when the starter Gianni Restelli started the race prematurely. He rejoined the other cars just in front of the blocked entrance to the old Monza banking, and James Hunt got so surprised that he veered left and hit Peterson&#x27;s Lotus 78 with his left front wheel. Peterson spun right and rammed the right Armco barrier hard, head-on; the front end of his Lotus 78 was crushed during the impact. Seven other drivers were collected: Carlos Reutemann, Hans Joachim Stuck, Patrick Depailler, Didier Pironi, Vittorio Brambilla, and Clay Regazzoni. Peterson&#x27;s car broke in two on impact with the barriers and caught fire, and Vittorio Brambilla, who was in the Surtees, was hit on the head by a flying wheel. Peterson and Brambilla were taken to hospital, the former with 27 fractures in his legs and feet, and there was a concern for the latter who was unconscious after being hit by the wheel. The rest of the drivers were uninjured, and most of them were able to take the restart.

The race restarted almost four hours after the original start. Again there was confusion as the front-row starters Andretti and Villeneuve went too early, but the rest of the field did not follow, and both Andretti and Villeneuve were handed one-minute penalties as a result. On the track, Villeneuve led ahead of Andretti and Jabouille until Jabouille retired, handing third place on the track to Lauda. His teammate Watson battled with Reutemann and Laffite and eventually pulled away. The battle on the track was between Villeneuve and Andretti, with the Lotus driver passing Villeneuve with five laps left. Andretti crossed the line first, with Villeneuve close behind, but when their one-minute penalties were added, Lauda emerged the victor ahead of Watson and Reutemann.

In a hospital, Peterson had a clot forming in his bloodstream after an operation on his legs, slipped into a coma overnight, and died the following day. This made Andretti the world champion, although he did not celebrate it, and mourned for Peterson along with his fellow drivers. Brambilla was able to recover from his injuries.

===Race 15: United States===
The season&#x27;s penultimate round was at Watkins Glen in the United States, and Lotus had hired Jean-Pierre Jarier to replace Peterson. Patrese could not race because the Grand Prix Drivers Association had deemed him responsible for the accident, ultimately killing Peterson.

New World Champion, and home hero, Andretti was shaken up more than most drivers due to Peterson&#x27;s death, but it did not stop him from romping to pole ahead of Reutemann, with Alan Jones&#x27;s Williams heading the second row. Andretti kept the lead at the start, with Reutemann and Villeneuve following ahead of Jones. Andretti suffered from an ill-handling car that had brake troubles and was soon passed by Reutemann, Villeneuve, and later Jones. Reutemann and Villeneuve ran 1–2 for Ferrari until Villeneuve&#x27;s engine blew up. This left Jones second and Andretti third, but Andretti&#x27;s engine blew up, handing third to Lauda until he also suffered the same fate, thus leaving Scheckter third before a charging Jarier passed him. However, Jarier ran out of fuel with four laps left, giving the place back to Scheckter. Reutemann took a comfortable win from Jones, with Scheckter completing the podium.

===Race 16: Canada===
The season finished in Canada, coming to the new île Notre-Dame circuit in Montreal; the Formula One circus left the previous Canadian GP location of Mosport Park due to safety issues with the Toronto circuit. In qualifying, Jarier starred by qualifying on pole ahead of Scheckter and home hero Villeneuve. Jarier could easily lead into the first corner, with Jones jumping up to second after a brilliant start and dropping Scheckter down to third. As Jarier began to pull away, Jones suffered a slow puncture and fell down the field as the race progressed, promoting Scheckter to second and Villeneuve to third, and then Villeneuve passed Scheckter mid-race to take second. Jarier continued to dominate until he retired with an oil leak, leaving Villeneuve to take his first career win in his home race ahead of Scheckter, with Reutemann taking third.

<doc id="1140083" wikidata="Q69396" url="?curid=1140083" title="1977 Formula One season">
<text>The 1977 Formula One season was the 31st season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 28th World Championship of Drivers and the 20th International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors. The season commenced on 9 January 1977 and ended on 23 October after seventeen races, making it the longest Formula One season in the sport&#x27;s history at the time. The season also included a single non-championship race for Formula One cars, the 1977 Race of Champions.

Niki Lauda won his second championship, despite Mario Andretti winning more races. Lauda did not complete the season, departing Scuderia Ferrari after securing the title at the 1977 United States Grand Prix. Ferrari won its third consecutive Constructors&#x27; title, with new driver Carlos Reutemann having a solid season.

The season was marred by a horrific accident during the South African GP: Tom Pryce was unable to avoid hitting 19-year-old race marshal Frederik Jansen van Vuuren, who had tried to cross the track. The latter was killed in the collision, while his fire extinguisher struck and killed Pryce. His car proceeded to the end of the straight where it collided with Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier. There was further tragedy as Carlos Pace lost his life in an aviation accident, only a couple of weeks later.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following drivers and constructors contested the World Championship of Drivers and the International Cup for Formula 1 Constructors:


===Team and driver changes===
* Ferrari opted to sign Carlos Reutemann in the place of Clay Regazzoni, who moved to Ensign. Jacky Ickx had left Ensign after his crash at Watkins Glen. He only competed in Formula 1 sporadically after this.
* Tyrrell signed Ronnie Peterson instead of Jody Scheckter, who moved to Wolf. Wolf had separated with Williams after the season. The squad led by Frank Williams bought a March 761 and signed driver Patrick Nève.
* The Penske team was bought by ATS Wheels to form the ATS Racing Team, who signed Jean-Pierre Jarier from Shadow. Ex-Penske driver John Watson moved to Brabham and Shadow signed Renzo Zorzi.
* At March, Alex Ribeiro bought a seat with sponsorship from a Brazilian bank and a tobacco company, next to Ian Scheckter, older brother of Jody. Vittorio Brambilla had moved from March to Surtees.

====Mid-season changes====
* On 5 March, Tom Pryce was killed during the South African Grand Prix, as did marshal Frederik Jansen van Vuuren. And on 18 March, Carlos Pace was killed in a private light aircraft accident in Brazil. From the race at Long Beach on, Hans-Joachim Stuck replaced Pace at Brabham and Alan Jones replaced Pryce at Shadow.
* Hesketh Racing missed the first four races of the season, but expanded their operation to three cars. 1976 British F3 champion Rupert Keegan was their number-one driver.
* David Purley returned to Formula 1, after a one-off entry to the 1974 British Grand Prix, with a LEC chassis designed by Mike Pilbeam. He suffered a serious accident during practice at Silverstone when his throttle stuck open, hitting a wall head-on and enduring a 179.8g deceleration.
* After winning the 1977 Can-Am season with Haas Lola, Patrick Tambay debuted in Formula 1 with Surtees for one race and then finished the season with Ensign.
* Renault entered Formula 1 with their own chassis, powered by their factory-developed 1.5 litre turbocharged engine, and driven by Jean-Pierre Jabouille. Although compression devices like turbos had been allowed since , they were the first constructor that made the investment into the technology on this level.
* After securing the Drivers&#x27; Championship with two races left on the calendar, Niki Lauda parted from his team and retired from the season. His place was taken by Gilles Villeneuve, in preparation for his full-season drive in .

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Argentine Grand Prix returned to the calendar after it was cancelled in due to economic and political reasons.
* The Belgian Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Belgian round followed the Monaco Grand Prix.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Paul Ricard Circuit to Dijon-Prenois, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone.
* The German Grand Prix was not held at the Nürburgring due to safety concerns. The 1977 race was held at the Hockenheimring for the first time since .
* The United States Grand Prix and Canadian Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Canadian round followed the US Grand Prix.

==Regulation changes==
* For the first time, the FIA set safety standards for helmets.

==Season report==

===Race 1: Argentina===

The 1977 season started in Argentina, returning after a year&#x27;s absence. It was reigning world champion James Hunt who started off his title defence with pole position in his McLaren. Countryman John Watson shared the front row with him in the Brabham, and Patrick Depailler in the six-wheeled Tyrrell was third on the grid. The weather was, as was very often the case in Buenos Aires, oppressively hot, which contributed to the attrition of this race – the track temperature was 51 °C (124 °F).

Watson took the lead at the start with Hunt second. Watson led for the first 10 laps until Hunt moved ahead and pulled away, with Mario Andretti&#x27;s Lotus third, but soon the other McLaren of Jochen Mass took the place. Mass had to retire soon after with an engine failure which caused him to spin, and a suspension failure took teammate and race leader Hunt out three laps later. Watson took the lead again, but he also had suspension failures and let teammate Carlos Pace through. Watson eventually retired, and Pace struggled towards the end due to heat in his cockpit and was passed by Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Wolf and Andretti, but the latter retired then with a wheel bearing failure. Scheckter took the first win of 1977, with Pace second, and home hero Carlos Reutemann completing the podium for Ferrari.

===Race 2: Brazil===

The second round took place at the longest circuit of the year – the very demanding and difficult 5-mile Interlagos circuit in São Paulo, Brazil. Hunt took pole again with Reutemann second and Andretti third on the grid. Home hero Pace took the lead at the start, with Hunt dropping behind Reutemann as well but soon Hunt was back behind Pace and attacking. There was contact, and Hunt took the lead whereas Pace had to pit for repairs. Hunt led Reutemann until he began to suffer from tyre troubles and was passed by Reutemann. Hunt pitted for new tyres, and rejoined fourth and soon passed Niki Lauda in the Ferrari and Watson to reclaim second. Reutemann marched on to victory, Hunt was second and Lauda third after Watson crashed out.

===Race 3: South Africa===

The race in South Africa was over a month later, but Hunt still continued his streak of poles, with Pace alongside and Lauda next. Hunt led off at the start, with Lauda and Scheckter following him after Pace struggled. The order stayed put until the seventh lap when Lauda took the lead and was never headed again, with Scheckter taking second from Hunt 11 laps later.

On lap 21, two marshals ran across the track after the Shadow of Renzo Zorzi caught fire. The second marshal, Fredrik Jansen van Vuuren, carrying a fire extinguisher was hit by the car of Tom Pryce at about 270 km/h (170 mph) and was killed instantly by the collision. His fire extinguisher struck Pryce&#x27;s face, killing and nearly decapitating him.

The race continued however, and Lauda won, his first since his own horror crash last year, with home hero Scheckter second, and Depailler&#x27;s six-wheeler took third from Hunt in the closing laps.

===Race 4: United States GP West===

The death of Pryce had shaken the field up, and then before the next round at Long Beach, California in the western United States, there was more news, as Carlos Pace, who had finished second in the opening round in Argentina, was killed in a plane crash.

The field, in a somber mood, went to this relatively new street circuit near Los Angeles, and Lauda took pole ahead of home hero Andretti, with Scheckter third. At the start, it was Scheckter who got the best start, and he passed both Andretti and Lauda, with Reutemann going up an escape road and spinning as he tried to follow Scheckter through. The top three of Scheckter, Andretti and Lauda pulled away from the rest of the pack, and ran closely together but the order did not change. However, a tyre began to deflate for Scheckter, and both Andretti and Lauda passed him with two laps left, with Andretti thus taking a popular home victory ahead of Lauda and a disappointed Scheckter.

===Race 5: Spain===

The next round was in Spain, at the Jarama circuit near Madrid, where Andretti continued his recent form with pole and Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier springing a surprise, beating Lauda to second, however Lauda was unable to take part in the race due to a broken rib. At the start, Andretti took the lead with Laffite following. Laffite gave chase to Andretti in the early stages but had to pit with a deflating tyre, leaving Andretti to romp to victory with Reutemann second. Hunt inherited third but retired with a misfire, giving it to Watson until he lost places due to a spin, leaving Scheckter to take the final spot on the podium.

===Race 6: Monaco===

In the elite Monaco race, Watson took his first career pole for Brabham with Scheckter also on the front row and Reutemann third. It was Scheckter who got the best start to beat Watson to the first corner, with Reutemann running third in the early stages until he was passed by his teammate Lauda. Watson ran second to Scheckter until mid-race when he had to retire with gearbox trouble, allowing Lauda to close in on Scheckter but the latter was flawless and held on to take his second win of the season. Lauda had to be satisfied with second, with Reutemann completing the podium.

===Race 7: Belgium===

Belgium was host to the seventh race of the season, and in qualifying at the Zolder circuit Andretti took a comfortable pole with Watson just beating the second Lotus of Gunnar Nilsson to second. The race was wet due to rain earlier in the day, and Watson took the lead at the first corner, but later in the first lap, Andretti ran into the back to him while attempting to retake the lead, resulting in both of them spinning out and Scheckter taking the lead.

Scheckter led the early stages ahead of Nilsson, whereas Reutemann made an early charge but spun off. The track began to dry and everyone had to pit for tyres, and those who stopped early were the ones who benefited, as now Lauda was leading from Jochen Mass and Scheckter was down to fifth. Mass spun off from second, handing it to Nilsson who then went on to catch and pass Lauda before driving away to his first career victory. Behind second-placed Lauda, Ronnie Peterson completed the podium for Team Tyrrell after Scheckter retired with an engine failure.

===Race 8: Sweden===

The Swedish race at the isolated Anderstorp Raceway was full of anticipation after Nilsson&#x27;s win last time out, but once again in qualifying, it was his teammate Andretti leading the way from Watson, with Hunt heading the second row. At the start, again it was Watson who led into the first corner followed by Scheckter, but soon Andretti passed both of them and opened up a lead. Watson and Scheckter battled for second until they collided, with Scheckter having to retire and Watson pitting for repairs. Hunt took second but he began to drop back and was passed by a charging Laffite, and then by his teammate Mass. Andretti however, was dominant until he had to pit due to a fuel metering problem with two laps left, handing the lead to Laffite who went on to take his first ever win ahead of Mass and Reutemann.

===Race 9: France===

The next race was staged at the newly extended Dijon-Prenois circuit in France, and once again it was Andretti on pole with Hunt second and Nilsson third on the grid. Hunt got the best start and led into the first corner from Watson and Laffite, with Andretti dropping down to fourth. However, Watson passed Hunt on the fifth lap and started to build a gap until Andretti got up to second and began to reel him in. During the final few laps, leader Watson and Andretti were running nose-to-tail but Watson held him off till the last lap when his engine missed a beat and immediately Andretti was past. Andretti thus took the win ahead of a crestfallen Watson and Hunt.

===Race 10: Great Britain===

British drivers had not much luck this season, so it was a relief to the British fans at the fast Silverstone circuit to see defending champion Hunt on pole for his home race with Watson alongside, and Lauda next. Hunt did not get a good start, and so Watson led into the first corner ahead of Lauda and Scheckter, but as the race progressed, a recovering Hunt soon passed both to get up to second behind Watson. The race was set for a grandstand British finish with Hunt slowly closing down leader Watson, but the fans were robbed of it when Watson&#x27;s fuel system failed with 15 laps left and retired 8 laps later. Hunt took the lead and went on to win his first race of the season, with Lauda second. Scheckter ran third until his engine failed, thus giving the place to Andretti until he too suffered a similar fate, leaving Nilsson to take the final spot on the podium.

===Race 11: West Germany===

The West German race took place in Hockenheim because the Nürburgring track was deemed to be too dangerous to race on because of the inability of the &#x27;Ring&#x27;s organizers to effectively manage such a huge circuit. In qualifying, Scheckter took his first pole of the season, ahead of Watson and then Lauda who headed the second row. Scheckter kept the lead at the first corner with both Watson and Lauda keeping their positions. Watson put pressure on Scheckter until his engine failed on the eighth lap, giving second to Lauda who passed Scheckter soon after and began to pull away. Scheckter battled for second with Hunt until the defending champion retired with an engine failure, giving third to Watson&#x27;s teammate and home driver Hans-Joachim Stuck. That was how it stayed to the end; Lauda winning from Scheckter and Stuck. One notable highlight of the race involved German touring car legend Hans Heyer, who started the race despite failing to qualify.

===Race 12: Austria===

With two-thirds of the season complete, Lauda led the championship as the drivers went to the very fast and scenic Österreichring in Austria. This circuit had been modified from the year before – a chicane had been put in to replace the ultra fast, flat out Voest-Hugel Kurve. Lauda pleased his home fans further by beating Hunt to pole, with Andretti settling for third on the grid. The race started in damp conditions, and poleman Lauda led into the first corner followed by Hunt, but Andretti passed both at one corner soon after. His teammate Nilsson was on a charge and was rapidly up to second, whereas Lauda went backwards.

Nilsson had to pit to change tyres, giving second to Hunt and this became the lead when Andretti&#x27;s engine failed. The Australian Alan Jones in the Shadow was now charging up the order, passing both Scheckter and Stuck and as the race progressed, the recovering Nilsson and Lauda also passed the duo, however none of them could make an impression on Hunt. Hunt seemed to be headed for victory until his engine failed with ten laps left, giving Jones his first ever Formula One victory. Lauda took second and Stuck was third, both benefiting after Nilsson also retired with an engine failure. Jones&#x27;s victory was so unexpected that the organizers did not have a copy of the Australian national anthem, so they played &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; instead (it was not Jones&#x27;s birthday that day).

===Race 13: Netherlands===

The field went to the Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam in the Netherlands for the next round, and in qualifying Andretti took his fifth pole of the season with Laffite alongside on the front row, and Hunt third. At the start, Hunt jumped both the front row starters to lead but before the end of the first lap, Andretti tried to drive alongside him but some aggressive defending from Hunt forced him to lift, and Laffite took advantage to get second. Five laps later, Andretti had got back past Laffite and was again attacking Hunt, who defended aggressively but this time Andretti did not lift and they collided. Hunt was out on the spot, whereas Andretti spun and rejoined fourth.

This left Laffite leading from the Ferraris of Lauda and Reutemann. The latter had a long battle with Andretti for third, repeatedly exchanging places, until the Lotus driver&#x27;s engine blew up. Soon after, Lauda passed Laffite to take the lead, and he went on build a gap and win comfortably. Laffite finished second. After Andretti&#x27;s demise, Reutemann ran third until the second Lotus of Nilsson attacked him, and the two collided with Nilsson out and Reutemann rejoining at the back. This sensationally left Patrick Tambay in the Ensign third, but he ran out of fuel on the last lap, thus handing the place to Scheckter.

This meant that Lauda had a 21-point lead over Scheckter with four races left.

===Race 14: Italy===

Italy was next on the calendar, but the fact that it was Ferrari&#x27;s home race at the Monza Autodrome near Milan did not deter Hunt who took pole, whereas Reutemann cheered the home fans by starting second in front of Scheckter. Scheckter took the lead after a brilliant start, and in second place was Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Ensign who got an even better one. Regazzoni however did not have the pace and soon dropped down the order, whereas Andretti was on the move, passing Hunt on the second lap, and Scheckter a few laps later to take the lead. Hunt dropped back with brake troubles as the race progressed, and Scheckter retired when his engine failed, leaving Reutemann and Lauda in second and third. Lauda was soon past Reutemann, and the latter had to retire when he spun off on oil on the track, handing third to Jones. The race finished in that order; with Andretti taking a dominant victory from Lauda, who closed in on the championship, and Jones who took his second podium in three races.

===Race 15: United States===

The scenario going into the second race in the eastern United States at the picturesque and fast Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York was that if Lauda had a single point or if Scheckter did not win the race, Lauda would be world champion. Scheckter&#x27;s hopes looked bleak as he qualified ninth to Lauda&#x27;s seventh, as Hunt took pole from the Brabhams of Stuck and Watson. Stuck got the best start and took the lead into the first corner followed by Hunt and Andretti. Scheckter was on a charge and passed many drivers, including Lauda, in the early stages to get up to fourth, which became third when leader Stuck crashed out. However, Hunt and Andretti continued to pull away from him and, with Lauda running fourth, Scheckter needed something extraordinary to happen to keep the title battle alive. That did not happen, as the rest of the race passed on without incident, with Hunt winning ahead of Andretti and Scheckter, with Lauda&#x27;s fourth place enough to make him the world champion.

After the race, Lauda decided not to race in the final two races because of the declining relationship between him and Ferrari.

===Race 16: Canada===

Canada was host to the penultimate round of the season at the fast and flowing Mosport Park near Toronto, and the field went in minus Lauda, who was unconvinced that Ferrari could prepare three cars efficiently for a Grand Prix – the third car was for French-Canadian Gilles Villeneuve in his debut race with Ferrari. In qualifying, Andretti took yet another pole ahead of Hunt, with Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s six-wheeled Tyrrell in third. The safety of the Mosport Park circuit was under intense scrutiny, as the ubiquitous bumps and limited safety of the circuit caused a number of nasty accidents including Briton Ian Ashley vaulting barriers and crashing into a TV tower. These accidents were dealt with badly and the severely injured Ashley was only flown out 40 minutes after he crashed. But the race went ahead anyway, and both Andretti and Hunt kept their positions at the start, with Hunt&#x27;s teammate Jochen Mass charging up to third. Andretti and Hunt then proceeded to demolish the entire field, but they themselves were separated by nothing as they ran nose-to-tail. With less than 20 laps left, they came to lap third-placed Mass during which there was a misunderstanding between the McLarens who collided and spun off, Hunt retiring and Mass pitting for repairs and rejoining fifth. Andretti was left well over a lap ahead until his engine failed with three laps left, giving the win to Scheckter. Patrick Depailler finished second for Tyrrell, and Mass completed the podium.

===Race 17: Japan===

The final round of the season was in Japan at the fast Fuji Speedway near Tokyo, and Andretti and Hunt continued their late-season battle, with the American pipping Hunt to the pole, with Watson heading the second row. Unlike the previous year, the weather conditions at the Fuji circuit near Tokyo were perfect, and Hunt took the lead at the start, and Scheckter and Mass jumped up to second and third, whereas Andretti had a terrible start and was at the tail of the top ten. On the second lap, Andretti was involved in a collision while trying to gain places, putting him out. But this race, like South Africa was marred by terrible tragedy. Peterson and Villeneuve came together at the end of the straight, and Villeneuve crashed appallingly and his Ferrari flew into a crowd that was standing in a restricted area, killing 2 photographers and injuring several others. But the race continued on, and with Andretti out, Hunt had no challengers left and he built a large gap, with teammate Mass second and Watson passing Scheckter for third. However, both Mass and Watson had to retire within one lap of each other with engine and gearbox failures, and with Scheckter dropping back, Reutemann was second until he was passed by Laffite. Hunt went on and capped off the season with a comfortable win, whereas Laffite ran of fuel on the last lap, handing over second to Reutemann and allowing Depailler to complete the podium. The Japanese Grand Prix was not held again until 1987 at the Suzuka circuit – there had been talk of moving the race from Fuji to Suzuka for 1978, but this never materialized.

==Results and standings==

===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. The International Cup for F1 Constructors only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. For both the Championship and the Cup, the best eight results from rounds 1-9 and the best seven results from rounds 10-17 were counted.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:

<doc id="1140084" wikidata="Q69387" url="?curid=1140084" title="1976 Formula One season">
<text>The 1976 Formula One season was the 30th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1976 World Championship of Drivers and the 1976 International Cup for Formula 1 Manufacturers. The two titles were contested over a sixteen race series which commenced on 25 January and ended on 24 October. Two non-championship races were also held during the 1976 season. In an extraordinarily political and dramatic season, the Drivers&#x27; Championship went to McLaren driver James Hunt by one point from Ferrari&#x27;s defending champion Niki Lauda, although Ferrari took the Manufacturers&#x27; trophy.

The controversy began in Spain where Hunt was initially disqualified from first place, handing the race win to Lauda, only for the decision to be overturned on appeal months later. Ferrari did not enter the Austrian Grand Prix out of protest. Hunt won in France and, it seemed, in Britain, but the race had been restarted after a first lap pile-up and Hunt drove on an access road returning to the pits, which was against the rules. He was eventually disqualified after an appeal from Ferrari. Lauda became the official race winner. Lauda had a massive crash at the Nürburgring in West Germany and appeared likely to die from his injuries, but managed to return after missing just two races. Going into the final race in Japan, Lauda led Hunt by three points. In the appalling weather conditions, Lauda withdrew from the race and Hunt finished third to take the championship trophy. This was the last championship for a British driver until Nigel Mansell in 1992. The 2013 film &quot;Rush&quot; is based on this season, focusing on the rivalry and friendship between Hunt and Lauda.

Other noteworthy events include the introduction of the six-wheeled Tyrrell P34, the last race by Chris Amon, regarded as one of the best F1 drivers never to win a championship, and the British Grand Prix, for being the only championship race ever in which more than one female driver were entered (although both failed to qualify).

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers contested the 1976 World Championship of Drivers and the 1976 International Cup for Formula 1 Manufacturers.

===Team and driver changes===

* Despite the success of Gordon Murray&#x27;s Cosworth-powered cars, Bernie Ecclestone signed a deal with Italian motor manufacturer Alfa Romeo to use their large and powerful flat-12 engine. The engines were supplied for free, but they rendered the new BT45s, now in red Martini Racing livery, unreliable and overweight.
* champion Emerson Fittipaldi moved to his brother Wilson&#x27;s team Fittipaldi Automotive, with Wilson taking on the role of manager instead of driver. Emerson&#x27;s seat at McLaren was given to James Hunt.
* The Shadow team which had entered into Formula One in the 1973 season under an American licence received a British licence, thus becoming the first team to officially change its nationality. Meanwhile, they had trialled a Matra V12 engine in , but without much success. So Guy Ligier, owner of various sports car operations, decided to buy the French company&#x27;s assets and start a Formula 1 team. They hired Jacques Laffite from Williams.
* After a dismal season with Lotus, Jacky Ickx moved to the newly formed Wolf-Williams Racing. Mario Andretti drove for Lotus in the opening race of the season and then acquired a permanent contract after his employer, the Parnelli team, folded.
* John Watson had moved from Surtees to Penske Racing at the end of 1975, and drove for them the whole 1976 season.
* BRM continued to decline, both in results and in operation size, only entering the first race of the 1976 season.
* Embassy Hill was scheduled to have entered a full season with Tony Brise but they pulled out following the Embassy Hill plane crash in November 1975 which killed all six members on the plane including Brise and team owner Graham Hill.

====Mid-season changes====
* At the end of , Ronnie Peterson was convinced by Colin Chapman to stay with Lotus, but after just one race into the 1976 season, the Swede joined March in favour of female driver Lella Lombardi. Fellow Swede Gunnar Nilsson, signed by March, was loaned to Lotus.
* Niki Lauda was seriously injured in a crash at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. His Ferrari burst into flames, nearly killing him after he inhaled hot toxic fumes and suffered severe burns. Carlos Reutemann negotiated a release from his Brabham contract to act as a replacement to Lauda. This would only lead to one drive, but the Argentinian was offered to a full-season drive in . Reutemann&#x27;s seat at Brabham was taken up by Rolf Stommelen and then Boro&#x27;s Larry Perkins.
* After seeing Lauda&#x27;s crash, Chris Amon promptly retired from Formula 1, until the Wolf-Williams team persuaded him to return. However, after a heavy collision with another car during qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix, he was lucky to walk away unharmed and definitely hung up his helmet. Jacky Ickx finished the season with Amon&#x27;s former employer Ensign, while Wolf-Williams hired Arturo Merzario from the March team.

==Calendar==
The Drivers and Manufacturers titles were contested over sixteen races.
===Calendar changes===
* The Argentine Grand Prix at Buenos Aires was originally scheduled as the first round of the season on 11 January, but was cancelled, largely due to economic and political concerns.
* The United States Grand Prix West hosted its first Grand Prix. The race was held on a street circuit in Long Beach near Los Angeles on 28 March.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved permanently to Jarama near Madrid. This was done in reaction to the accident in the 1975 race in Montjuïc, in which five spectators were killed.
* The Belgian Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Monaco came second this time. Nivelles-Baulers in Brussels was due to host the Belgian Grand Prix in rotation with Circuit Zolder, but the track surface at Nivelles had deteriorated and Zolder took over the slot.
* The British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was moved from mid June to late August.
* The Canadian Grand Prix returned to the calendar, after it was cancelled in } due to a dispute between two rival breweries and event sponsors, Labatt and Molson.
* The Japanese Grand Prix hosted its first Grand Prix with a three-year contract. The race was held at Fuji Speedway on 24 October.

==Regulation changes==

There had been no impactful regulation changes over the winter, but before the 1976 Spanish Grand Prix, a restriction was placed on the height of the air box to no more than . This eliminated many eye-striking designs seen in the past years. It was also stipulated at that time, that an F1 car could not be wider than . This caught out the McLaren team and James Hunt was disqualified, only for the decision to be overturned by the team&#x27;s appeal.

==Season report==
===Race 1: Brazil===
For the opening round of the season in Brazil at the 5-mile Interlagos circuit in São Paulo, James Hunt took pole position in his McLaren with reigning World Champion Niki Lauda alongside in his Ferrari (which set the tone for the season). Clay Regazzoni in the second Ferrari took the lead at the start. Regazzoni, Lauda, Hunt and Shadow&#x27;s Jean-Pierre Jarier battled. Regazzoni and Jarier collided, and the former had to pit for repairs. Lauda now led from Hunt and Jarier, but Hunt crashed out due to a sticking throttle, and Jarier did the same a lap later after driving on some oil in the track. Lauda thus started his title defence with victory, with Patrick Depailler second in the Tyrrell, and Tom Pryce completing the podium in the other Shadow.

===Race 2: South Africa===
At the Kyalami circuit near Johannesburg, Hunt took pole position for the second time in two races, with Lauda alongside again. It was Lauda who led into the first corner, with Hunt dropping down to fourth behind McLaren teammate Jochen Mass and Vittorio Brambilla in his March. Hunt was waved through by Mass, and passed Brambilla to take second after five laps. Lauda led from start to finish to win again, with Hunt second and Mass third for McLaren.

===Race 3: United States GP West===
Well after the South African race, the drivers assembled at Long Beach in the US for the third round. Regazzoni took pole position with Depailler second, forcing Hunt and Lauda onto the second row. The top four maintained their positions at the start, and almost immediately Regazzoni began to pull away. Hunt now tried to pass Depailler for second; they collided; Hunt was out, Depailler went wide, and Lauda sailed through to second. Depailler kept third until a spin which dropped him well down the order, but he charged back up to fifth, and was back in third after Pryce&#x27;s Shadow, and Jody Scheckter in the second Tyrrell retired after driveshaft and suspension failures respectively. Regazzoni went on to take a dominant victory, with Lauda completing the Ferrari 1–2, and Depailler third.

===Race 4: Spain===
As the European season began at the Jarama circuit near Madrid, there was a big talking point as the Tyrrell team entered a new P34 six-wheeler for Depailler. Depailler was on the pace and qualified third, behind Hunt and Lauda. Lauda once again beat Hunt off the line at the start and led for the first third of the race. Depailler, after a slow start, was running fourth behind Mass when he spun off and crashed with brake problems. Just before mid-race, the McLarens of Hunt and Mass found another gear and drove past Lauda, but towards the end of the race, Mass had to retire with an engine failure. Hunt took his first win of the season, with Lauda second and Gunnar Nilsson&#x27;s Lotus third.

After the race, Hunt was disqualified because his McLaren was found to be too wide. McLaren appealed, saying this was due to the expansion of the tyres during the race, and two months after the race, Hunt was reinstated.

===Race 5: Belgium===
The fifth round was at the Zolder circuit near the Dutch-Belgian border. Ferrari locked out the front row, with Lauda on pole from Regazzoni. Lauda motored away as the start, with Hunt up to second but, soon Regazzoni took the place back. The Ferraris raced away, and Hunt dropped to sixth, behind Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Ligier and the two six-wheeled Tyrrells, before eventually retiring with a transmission failure. Depailler also retired when his engine blew up. Lauda won, and Regazzoni completed a dominant Ferrari 1–2, with Laffite taking his first podium.

===Race 6: Monaco===
Lauda took pole with Regazzoni alongside on the front row again. Lauda led into the first corner, and was never headed again. Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s March got up to second, and allowed Lauda to pull away by holding up Regazzoni and the two Tyrrells. At one-third distance, Regazzoni went down an escape road because of oil on the track, and Peterson spun off and crashed on the next lap due to the same reason. This left Scheckter second and Depailler third but Regazzoni charged back and passed Depailler. He, however crashed out with 5 laps left while chasing Scheckter, thus ensuring that both the six-wheeled cars were on the podium behind Lauda.

Lauda now had a massive 33-point lead in the championship over Regazzoni and Hunt.

===Race 7: Sweden===
Scheckter took pole in Sweden at Anderstorp, the first for the Tyrrell P34, with Mario Andretti&#x27;s Lotus second and Chris Amon an amazing 3rd on the grid in the Ensign. Andretti took the lead at the start, but went off with engine failure at around two thirds distance. The six-wheelers went on to dominate (much to the chagrin of some of the other teams) and finished 1–2, with Scheckter winning. Amon was robbed of a possible podium by a suspension failure. As a result, third place went to the consistent Lauda. With Hunt finishing fifth Scheckter was now second in the points for the world championship.

===Race 8: France===
The French round took place at the Paul Ricard circuit in the south of France, and &#x27;normal service&#x27; was resumed, with Hunt on pole and Lauda second, with Depailler third, continuing Tyrrell&#x27;s strong form. Lauda beat Hunt off the line as usual, and led the early stages until his engine failed. Hunt now led with Regazzoni close behind, but Regazzoni&#x27;s Ferrari engine also failed. With the Ferraris out, any challenge to Hunt evaporated, and Hunt went on to win with Depailler second. Scheckter ran third until he faded away with engine trouble, giving John Watson third and Penske its first podium.

===Race 9: Great Britain===
The British fans had found a new hero in Hunt, but it was Lauda who took pole at Brands Hatch, beating the home hero Hunt into second, and Andretti showing Lotus&#x27;s pace with third. At the start, Regazzoni began like a rocket and was immediately up to second, and was challenging Lauda. The two touched, and Regazzoni spun. He was hit by Hunt and Jacques Laffite but the rest of the field were away safely. However, there was too much debris on track, and the race was to be restarted. In controversial circumstances McLaren, Ferrari and Ligier had Hunt, Regazzoni and Laffite all take part in the restarted race in spare cars.

There was no trouble in the restart, as Lauda led from Hunt and Regazzoni into the first corner. The top three were unchanged till mid-race until Regazzoni retired with a gearbox problem, promoting Scheckter to third. Lauda led comfortably until he too suffered from gearbox troubles, and home hero Hunt took the lead with 15 minutes left, sending the home fans wild. Hunt went on to win, with Lauda hanging on to second and Scheckter third.

After the race, Ferrari, Tyrrell and the Fittipaldi team appealed against Hunt being allowed to take part in the spare car. Ferrari took the matter to the FIA (which was hypocritical since their own driver, Regazzoni had started in a spare, although he retired), and two months later, Hunt was disqualified and Lauda was given the win. Scheckter was promoted to second, Watson had another podium, and Two-time champion Emerson Fittipaldi got sixth place and a point.

===Race 10: West Germany===
There were concerns by the drivers in the German GP held at the legendary Nordschleife about the safety of the track. The mountainous Nordschleife section of the Nürburgring was 14 miles (23 km) long – almost 3 times longer than Interlagos, the next longest circuit on the calendar and 7 times longer than the Monaco street circuit and its size meant it was nearly impossible to manage it safely to 1976 regulatory standards- the organizers were not willing or able to provide up to 5 times the marshals, medical services and firefighters needed at this circuit than at any other F1 circuit. Ultimately, all the drivers decided to race, and it was no surprise that Hunt and Lauda were on the front row, the British driver on pole, with Depailler heading the second row. At the start, on a damp but drying track, once again it was Regazzoni who started off best, whereas Lauda was slow and lost a lot of places. Regazzoni was leading from Hunt but he spun and dropped to fourth. At the end of the first lap, over eight minutes after the race started most of the drivers decided to pit for dry tyres. This left Mass&#x27;s McLaren leading from Gunnar Nilsson.
On the second lap, Lauda lost control at high speed due to a suspected rear suspension failure and crashed into the barriers before bouncing back on to the track, and the car caught fire. The car was then hit by Harald Ertl&#x27;s Hesketh and Brett Lunger&#x27;s Surtees. The two drivers immediately got out of their cars, and soon Arturo Merzario stopped his Wolf–Williams as well and also Guy Edwards helped. The four pulled Lauda out of the burning car, and the race was stopped. It took the one helicopter (which was parked at the pits on one extreme end of the circuit) at the track an excruciating 5 to 6 minutes to get to the accident site, and Lauda was sent to hospital with serious burns and was fighting for his life.
The race restarted, with the starting slots of Lauda, Ertl and Lunger left empty. Hunt led at the restarted race with Regazzoni up to second, but this did not last long as Regazzoni spun off and dropped back, and Depailler hit the barriers while trying to avoid him. This left Hunt with a big lead ahead of Carlos Pace in the Brabham, the Brabham team showing some speed. Soon, Scheckter was up to second, and Pace was passed by a recovering Regazzoni. Hunt eased to victory ahead of Scheckter, and Mass completed the podium by passing Pace after Regazzoni spun off (again).

With Hunt&#x27;s crucial victory at this longest of racing circuits, and after 49 years of Grand Prix racing, the 1976 German Grand Prix was the last Grand Prix at the old Nürburgring- one of the most iconic, historic and legendary circuits in motorsport. The German Grand Prix moved further south to the Hockenheimring and Grand Prix racing did not return to the Nürburgring until 1984 on the newly constructed 2.8 mile (4.5 km) Grand Prix circuit.

===Race 11: Austria===
The news before the Austrian GP at the Österreichring was that Lauda&#x27;s condition was no longer life-threatening, but there was a low attendance with Lauda not racing; and Ferrari were so shaken by Lauda&#x27;s crash that they did not compete at all. Hunt meanwhile took pole, ahead of countryman Watson and Ronnie Peterson. Watson took the lead at the start ahead of Peterson and Hunt, but soon Peterson was in the lead. Scheckter was on a charge from the mid-field, and he took the lead on the 10th lap, but then Watson was back in front. Scheckter battled until he crashed due to a suspension failure, and Peterson ultimately began to drop back. Watson thus won, the result being his and Penske&#x27;s first win, and the podium was completed by Laffite and Nilsson.

===Race 12: Netherlands===
Lauda had begun his recovery, and was planning to race later in the season, and as a result, Ferrari were back in business in the Netherlands, but with only one car for Regazzoni. It was Peterson who took pole at Zandvoort, beating pole king Hunt and Tom Pryce&#x27;s Shadow. Peterson led the early stages ahead of Watson, until Watson made a mistake which let Hunt through. Peterson then struggled and dropped behind Hunt, Watson and Regazzoni. Watson retired with a gearbox failure, promoting Regazzoni and Peterson, but the latter also retired when he lost oil pressure. Regazzoni now closed up on Hunt, bringing Mario Andretti with him, but Hunt held them off, with Regazzoni and Andretti within two seconds of him in second and third.

===Race 13: Italy===
After the Dutch GP, with Hunt only two points behind Lauda, the championship seemed to be a cakewalk for him. But then came the news that Lauda was going to make an astonishing return for the last four races of the season (it was so unexpected that Ferrari had to run three cars for Lauda, Regazzoni, and Lauda&#x27;s supposed replacement Carlos Reutemann), just six weeks after his accident.

As the event went on at the modified Monza circuit, Laffite took pole in qualifying, with Scheckter&#x27;s six-wheeler alongside and Pace third. Lauda was fifth, and Hunt along with Watson and Mass were penalised and sent to the back because of supposed fuel irregularities. At the start, Scheckter led ahead of Laffite and Depailler with Lauda down in the midfield, but soon Peterson was on a charge and took the lead after 14 laps. Peterson&#x27;s charge also brought Regazzoni with him, and soon the Swiss was up to third. Scheckter dropped off, and the top four of Peterson, Depailler, Regazzoni and Laffite ran closely. Hunt spun off while trying to charge up the field, and Depailler dropped back late on with engine trouble. Peterson took his first win in two years, with Regazzoni second, Laffite third, and Lauda an incredible fourth.

===Race 14: Canada===
The week-long North American tour started with the teams assembling at the scenic Mosport Park track near Toronto for the Canadian Grand Prix. Hunt&#x27;s disqualification from the British GP came after the Italian race, and as a result Hunt had only 47 points to Lauda&#x27;s 64 with three races left. The Englishman took pole, with Peterson also on the front row ahead of March teammate Vittorio Brambilla. As usual, Hunt did not start well, and Peterson took the lead. But it was not for long as Hunt retook the lead on lap 10, and soon both Marches dropped way back, and so Depailler was second and Andretti third. The top three of Hunt, Depailler and Andretti were unchanged for the rest of the race. Lauda was running fifth until handling issues dropped him out of the points, and Hunt had closed the gap to 8 points.

===Race 15: United States===
The penultimate round and the second leg of the North American tour was in the US at Watkins Glen, New York, a circuit similar (and close by) to Mosport Park in that it was fast and scenic with a number of long, sweeping corners. Hunt took his eighth pole of the season, with the six-wheeler of Scheckter alongside, and Peterson third. As expected, Scheckter took the lead at the start, with Hunt and Brambilla following. The front two pulled away and battled, with Hunt passing Scheckter mid-race and Scheckter returning the favour a few laps later. Hunt took the lead again with 14 laps left and went on to win, and Scheckter had to settle for second. The Marches were again unable to keep up the pace, and it was left to Lauda to take an astonishing podium, just beating Mass in the second McLaren.

===Race 16: Japan===
The championship was to be decided in Japan at the fast Fuji Speedway near Tokyo, and Lauda was leading Hunt by three points. In qualifying, Hunt took second, but Lauda was right behind in third as Andretti took pole for Lotus. On race day, it rained heavily, and the weather was dreadful with the track full of water and the rain pelting down. Hunt got a good start for once, and took the lead from Andretti. Some of the drivers protested, saying it was too dangerous to race. At the end of the second lap, Lauda came into the pits and withdrew, saying that the conditions were too dangerous. Emerson Fittipaldi and Carlos Pace also withdrew. At the front, Hunt was leading but was soon challenged by Brambilla until the Italian spun out of contention. By mid-race, Mass had jumped up to second behind his teammate and acted as a protective buffer, but then crashed out. Hunt led from Depailler and Andretti, but then began to suffer from tyre wear, and both drivers passed with 11 laps left. This was still fine as Hunt was third and needed only three points to become World Champion, because he had more wins than Lauda. This became second when Depailler&#x27;s tyres gave out, and he suffered a puncture but soon Hunt himself also had the same fate and had to pit. Andretti now led, with Alan Jones&#x27;s Surtees second, Regazzoni third, Depailler fourth and Hunt fifth. On old, worn-out tyres, Jones and Regazzoni were fighting just to save their tyres, and first Depailler, and then Hunt with just two laps left passed both of them. Andretti won, getting his first win in five years, with Depailler second, and Hunt&#x27;s third place meant that he was the F1 World Champion of 1976.

<doc id="1140085" wikidata="Q69375" url="?curid=1140085" title="1975 Formula One season">
<text>The 1975 Formula One season was the 29th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1975 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the 1975 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers which were contested concurrently from 12 January to 5 October over fourteen races. The season also included three non-championship Formula One races and a nine race South African Formula One Championship.

After a strong finish to the season, many observers felt the Brabham team were favourites going into the new year. An emotional first win for Carlos Pace in his native São Paulo looked to confirm this, but tyre wear frequently hampered the cars and the initial promise was not maintained. In his second year with Ferrari, Niki Lauda was given the keys to the Ferrari 312T, a car that was technically far superior to any of the competition. He won his first drivers&#x27; title with five wins and a huge margin over second place in the championship. Ferrari took home the championship trophy for manufacturers. Lauda often referred to 1975 as &quot;the unbelievable year&quot;.

American Mark Donohue died in August, two days after crashing in practice for the Austrian Grand Prix. And after the season, in late November, an Embassy Hill airplane crashed in England and all six aboard were killed, including team owner Graham Hill and driver Tony Brise.

==Drivers and constructors==
The following drivers and constructors and contested the 1975 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the 1975 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers.

===Team and driver changes===

* The Williams had lost their sponsorship from Iso and Marlboro and entered two cars under their own name for the first time.
* Having driven for Brabham in and , Wilson Fittipaldi entered this season with his own team and chassis. He drove the car himself and managed to launch two new developments of the car during the year.
* Denny Hulme retired at the end of the season. Jochen Mass, who already drove the last two races for McLaren, was signed for a full season with the team.
* March signed Lella Lombardi. She was the first woman to qualify in an F1 race since Maria Teresa de Filippis in .
* John Watson was signed by Surtees, after entering all 1974 races in a private Brabham.

====Mid-season changes====
* After two races, Bob Evans replaced Mike Wilds at BRM, Jacky Ickx left Lotus halfway through the season.
* Embassy Racing, owned by Graham Hill, entered a Lola chassis for the first three races and then their first Hill chassis. The only difference, however, was the employment of their designer and subsequent naming of the chassis.
* Ensign missed the first part of the season but returned with a duo of Dutch drivers, Roelof Wunderink and Gijs van Lennep, following new sponsorship by the Dutch security company HB Bewaking.
* John Nicholson had won the 1973 and 1974 British Formula Atlantic Championship in a Lyncar 005, before he debuted in the 1975 British Grand Prix with a Lyncar-commissioned F1 chassis. He also tried this in , but had not managed to qualify on that attempt.
* Shadow trialled a Matra V12 engine for two races, but Jean-Pierre Jarier retired on both occasions.
* American Mark Donohue died in August, two days after crashing in practice for the Austrian Grand Prix. John Watson was released from Surtees to drive for Penske and would stay with the American team in 1976.
* Nearing the end of 1974, Chris Amon had retired his own team and drove two races for BRM. He returned to F1 near the end of the 1975 season with Ensign.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from Jarama to Montjuïc, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the French Grand Prix was moved from Dijon-Prenois to Paul Ricard Circuit, and the British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone.
* The Belgian Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Monaco round followed the Belgian Grand Prix.
* The Canadian Grand Prix was originally scheduled to be the penultimate race in 1975 but was cancelled due to a small row between Formula One Constructors&#x27; Association and Mosport Park about payments.

==Regulation changes==
* Fire-resistant race suits were made obligatory.
* The concept of marshal posts, with service roads leading to and from them, was created and implemented at various circuits. Also, from now on, marshals had to practice rescuing drivers from their cars.

==Season report==
===Race 1: Argentina===
The drivers went to Argentina to start the season, and it was Jean-Pierre Jarier in the Shadow who took pole position with the Brabhams of Carlos Pace and Carlos Reutemann second and third on the grid. However, poleman Jarier could not even start the race because his transmission failed on the parade lap. Home hero Reutemann took the lead from teammate Pace, with Niki Lauda&#x27;s Ferrari third.

Pace passed teammate Reutemann to take the lead but then spun off and dropped to seventh. James Hunt in his Hesketh soon overtook Lauda and then Reutemann, much to the chagrin of the crowd. By then, reigning world champion Emerson Fittipaldi in his McLaren was past Lauda and up to third, and soon took Reutemann for second as well. Fittipaldi closed in on Hunt and took the lead with 18 laps left. Pace recovered to fourth after his spin, but it was to no avail as his engine blew up. Fittipaldi started his title defence with a win, Hunt was a superb second, and Reutemann third in front of his home crowd.

===Race 2: Brazil===
The second round was in Brazil, and Jarier took pole position again with Fittipaldi alongside and Reutemann third. Reutemann, just like in Argentina, took the lead at the start from Jarier and Pace was up to third, whereas home driver Fittipaldi dropped to seventh. Jarier retook the lead from Reutemann on lap 5 and then pulled away. Reutemann struggled with handling issues and dropped well down the order then, with Pace up to second, Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Ferrari third and Fittipaldi recovering to fourth. Jarier&#x27;s engine stopped with seven laps left and Pace took the lead. Regazzoni was up to second but dropped behind Fittipaldi and Jochen Mass in the second McLaren as he too suffered handling issues. Pace took a home victory, with countryman Fittipaldi second and Mass third.

===Race 3: South Africa===
A month after the Brazilian race, the field went to South Africa and Pace followed up his win with pole, with Reutemann alongside as Brabham locked out the front row, and home hero Jody Scheckter was third in the Tyrrell. Pace led at the start, with Scheckter second, and Ronnie Peterson in his Lotus jumped up from eighth to take third. However, the Swede did not have the pace of the front runners and dropped back down the order. Scheckter took the lead from Pace on the third lap, to the delight to the fans. Pace kept second until he struggled with tyres and was passed by Reutemann and the second Tyrrell of Patrick Depailler. Scheckter took an emotional home victory, with Reutemann and Depailler completing the podium.

===Race 4: Spain===
Nearly two months after the third round, the European season began in Spain at the very fast Montjuic street circuit in Barcelona. The Grand Prix Drivers Association was not happy with the state of the barriers, which were not bolted properly, and the drivers threatened not to take part. Mechanics from the teams went around the entire circuit to attempt to repair/fasten down the barriers. After work was done on the circuit, the drivers agreed that the circuit was still not safe enough. Reigning world champion and championship leader Emerson Fittipaldi had no intention to race because of the condition of the barriers, and went home on Sunday morning. The organisers of the event then locked the cars and motorhomes inside the circuit confines for breach of contract and threatened to keep them there. This being incompatible with the schedule for the next race at Monaco, the teams decided to cater for the organisers wishes and raced anyway.

The rest of the drivers were there for qualifying, and Ferrari took the front row, with Lauda on pole from Regazzoni, and Hunt third in the Hesketh. There was chaos at the start when Mario Andretti in his Parnelli tapped the car of polesitter Lauda, sending it into the sister car of Regazzoni and knocking both Ferraris out of contention. Hunt gratefully took the lead, and Andretti, whose car was undamaged was second. Hunt led until he crashed after spinning on oil on the track, leaving Andretti leading from John Watson in the Surtees and Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s Hill. Watson then had to pit with a vibration and the leader Andretti retired after a suspension failure sent him into the guardrail. This promoted Pace to second and Peterson to third, but the Swede retired after colliding with backmarker François Migault while lapping him.

On lap 26, Stommelen&#x27;s rear wing broke, and the car bounced into the barriers and flew back onto the road, hitting the barrier on the other side but the momentum of the car was enough for it to fly over the barrier where spectators were watching. The car hit some of them, and five spectators were killed, and Stommelen and other spectators were injured. Pace also crashed while trying to avoid the Hill as it bounced back off the road. The race went on for the moment, with Jochen Mass passing Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Lotus to lead. The organizers stopped the race on lap 30 due to the debris on the track caused by Stommelen&#x27;s crash. Mass was declared the winner, with Ickx second and Reutemann third. Only half points were awarded as the race was stopped before it had run 75% of its full course.

===Race 5: Monaco===
After the chaotic and tragic Spanish GP, the race on the streets of Monaco was next. Lauda took pole ahead of the Shadow of Tom Pryce, with Pryce&#x27;s teammate Jarier third. Rain before the race meant that it was started on a damp track. Lauda took off into the lead and Jarier climbed up to second but crashed on the first lap. Peterson was up to second, and Pryce was third. Pryce spun off after 20 laps, giving third to Scheckter. The field soon pitted for dry weather tyres and this shuffled up the order, with Scheckter dropping back after pitting too late. Fittipaldi was up to second behind Lauda, and Pace jumped up to third. That is how it stayed, with Lauda winning, Fittipaldi second and Pace third.

It was the last weekend for Graham Hill in Formula One.

===Race 6: Belgium===
The next race took place in Belgium, and Lauda was on pole with Pace with him on the front row, and Vittorio Brambilla in the March a surprising third. It was Pace who got the better of Lauda at the start, to lead into the first corner. Pace was leading from Lauda and Brambilla at the end of the first lap, but Brambilla was on the move, and shocked everyone by overtaking both the front-row starters to lead. But this spurred Lauda into action, and after almost immediately passing Pace, he took the lead from Brambilla on the sixth lap. Scheckter was also on the move and was up to second, after passing Brambilla on lap 9. Brambilla held third until he was forced to pit with tyre troubles. Lauda won, becoming the first driver to take two wins this season, with Scheckter second and Reutemann third.

===Race 7: Sweden===
In Sweden, it was Brambilla who took his first career pole, with Depailler second and Jarier third on the grid. The order was unchanged at the start, with Brambilla leading but Reutemann was up to third after three laps. Brambilla continued to lead, whereas second-placed Depailler dropped out of contention with brake problems. Reutemann was up to second, and now took the lead from Brambilla. Brambilla had to pit for new tyres almost immediately. Jarier ran second now, but his engine blew up and this gave the position to Pace until he spun off and retired. Lauda was now second, and towards the end of the race Reutemann began to suffer from oversteer, allowing Lauda to take the lead with 10 laps left. Lauda went on to win, with Reutemann and Regazzoni completing the podium.

===Race 8: Netherlands===
The first race in the second half of the season took place in the Netherlands, and pole went to Lauda as usual, with teammate Regazzoni alongside, and Hunt&#x27;s Hesketh third. The race started on a damp track and Lauda took the lead, with Scheckter up to second ahead of Regazzoni. The order was unchanged until the drivers had to pit for dry tyres. Hunt and Jarier pitted early, and their gamble paid off as they were first and second, with Lauda, Scheckter and Regazzoni third, fourth and fifth respectively. Lauda passed Jarier for second midway through the race, and started closing on Hunt. Jarier almost immediately retired with a tyre failure, and Scheckter who inherited third had his engine blow up with just 12 laps left. Hunt held off Lauda to take his first career win, with Regazzoni completing the podium.

===Race 9: France===
France was host to the 9th round of the season, and it was Lauda on pole ahead of Scheckter and Hunt. The top three maintained their starting positions into the first corner. In the early laps, Regazzoni was on a charge, and got up to second on the sixth lap but his engine blew up and he had to retire. Scheckter soon faded away, giving Hunt second. That was how it ended, with Lauda winning to take a large championship lead, Hunt finishing second and Mass third.

===Race 10: Great Britain===
The tenth round was held at the Silverstone airfield circuit in Great Britain, and Tom Pryce took a home pole position, with Pace second and championship leader Lauda third. Pace beat Pryce into the first corner, with Regazzoni third ahead of Lauda. After 10 laps, Regazzoni passed Pryce for second, and soon both of them passed Pace. It soon began to rain, and Regazzoni was pulling away until he spun off, hit a barrier and damaged his rear wing. He rejoined two laps down. Pryce now led, but he crashed out as well, two laps later. Scheckter had meanwhile passed both Lauda and Pace, and he was now leading.

Scheckter pitted for wet tyres from the lead, and most drivers followed suit. Hunt (after passing Pace) was the leader from Pace and Emerson Fittipaldi as they had not pitted for dries. Scheckter and Jarier both caught and passed the trio, but the track was drying out, and both had to pit for dries soon after. Hunt began to lose power in his engine, and was passed by Fittipaldi, and then Pace, and even a recovering Scheckter. On lap 56 out of 70, the rain fell again, in a massive shower with the whole field on dries. Nearly all the drivers spun off and crashed, and race was stopped. Only 6 drivers were left (notably Fittipaldi). The race was stopped, and the results were declared on the lap before the storm struck. Fittipaldi was the winner, and Pace and Scheckter, despite crashing out, were given second and third.

The result meant that Fittipaldi closed within 14 points of Lauda with five races left.

===Race 11: West Germany===
The drivers had to go to West Germany, in the legendary Nordschleife track, for round 11- and this proved to be the most crucial round in the championship (the German Grand Prix often was). Lauda was on pole, lapping the 14.2 mi (22.8 km) circuit in under 7 minutes- becoming the first driver to accomplish this feat. Pace was on the front row, and the two Tyrrell drivers Scheckter and Depailler third and fourth respectively. At the start, Lauda led from Pace, with Depailler getting third from his teammate Scheckter, who made a dreadful start and dropped to 20th. Depailler was past Pace early on, but by midway through the race, both drivers were out of contention, Pace retiring with a puncture, and Depailler having to pit after a suspension failure. Lauda continued to lead with Regazzoni up to second, until the latter&#x27;s engine failed. Lauda then suffered a puncture and a damaged spoiler and had to pit, leaving Reutemann to lead from Hunt and Pryce. Hunt was next to retire, with a wheel hub failure on the straight behind the pits, and Pryce took second, but only briefly as he had to back off towards the end with fuel-feed troubles. At the front, Reutemann took his first win of the season, with Jacques Laffite&#x27;s Williams second, and Lauda recovering to third.

===Race 12: Austria===
The Austrian GP on 17 August had a very large attendance, as Lauda had a chance of getting close to the championship at his home race. Lauda did not disappoint them, as he took pole position, with Hunt second and Fittipaldi third. His chief rival, Reutemann, was only 11th. On a morning practice lap, Mark Donohue&#x27;s March slid off the track after a tyre failure and hit two marshals. Donohue died two days later, and one of the marshals also died.

It began to rain just before the race started, but it did not deter Lauda, who led from Hunt and Depailler. Depailler soon dropped back, and it was Vittorio Brambilla who was up to third. Lauda also began to struggle as the rain became heavier, and Hunt took the lead and Brambilla second on lap 15. Brambilla went to take the lead from Hunt four laps later when they were lapping a backmarker, whereas Pryce passed Lauda for third. Conditions became so bad that the organizers showed the chequered flag early, with Brambilla the winner (he spun off on the slowing down lap and crashed, and drove around to the pits waving to the fans with a badly damaged car), Hunt second and Pryce completing the podium. Only half points were given, as the race was stopped early, just like in Spain.

===Race 13: Italy===
The penultimate round was in Italy, and after the cancellation of the Canadian GP, Lauda needed only half a point to be the 1975 world champion. The Ferrari fans were very happy as their team locked out the front row, with Lauda on pole from Regazzoni, and Fittipaldi third. Regazzoni took the lead at the start, with Lauda and Mass following. Soon Reutemann was up to third, but he needed to win to keep any faint hopes alive. However, he was passed by Fittipaldi, and towards the end, Lauda backed off and let Fittipaldi through. It was Regazzoni who won the race, with Fittipaldi second, and Lauda&#x27;s third was enough to seal the championship.

===Race 14: United States===
The final round took place in the US, and it was no surprise that at the spectacular Watkins Glen track in upstate New York (which had a new chicane at the Esses introduced), new World Champion Lauda took pole again, with Fittipaldi alongside and Reutemann third. Lauda led into the first corner from Fittipaldi, and it was Jarier in third. Lauda and Fittipaldi drove away from the rest of the field, whereas Jarier retired with a wheel failure one-third into the race. This left Hunt in third, but Mass had other ideas and took the place midway through the race. Lauda went on to win, his fifth of the season, as he signed off in style, with Fittipaldi close behind in second, and Mass also on the podium.

==Results and standings==
=== Grands Prix ===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. For both the Championship and the Cup, the best six results from rounds 1-7 and the best six results from rounds 8-14 were counted.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

* Half points were awarded because the races were stopped before 75% of the scheduled distance was completed.

===International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings===

* Bold results counted to championship.
* Half points awarded because the races were stopped before 75% of the scheduled distance was completed.

==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One races were also held in 1975, which did not count towards the World Championship.

<doc id="1140086" wikidata="Q69343" url="?curid=1140086" title="1974 Formula One season">
<text>The 1974 Formula One season was the 28th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1974 World Championship of F1 Drivers and the 1974 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, contested concurrently over a fifteen-race series which commenced on 13 January and ended on 6 October. The season also included three non-championship races.

Defending champion Jackie Stewart did not drive in 1974, having announced his retirement at the end of the previous season. Emerson Fittipaldi (McLaren) and Clay Regazzoni (Ferrari) went into the last race of the championship with equal number of points, but Regazzoni dropped down the field with handling problems and Fittipaldi&#x27;s fourth place gave him his second championship. This was also the first title for McLaren and the first of many titles for a team sponsored by the Marlboro cigarette brand.

Two F1 drivers died over the course of the season: Peter Revson during practice for the South African Grand Prix and Helmut Koinigg during the United States Grand Prix.

== Teams and drivers ==
The following teams and drivers contested the 1974 World Championship.
===Team and driver changes===


A relatively large number of driver changes had happened over the winter:
* After winning the championship but then struggling in the second half of , Emerson Fittipaldi left Lotus for McLaren. Mike Hailwood moved up from Surtees to partner him. Fittipaldi&#x27;s seat at Lotus was taken up by Jacky Ickx from Ferrari.
* New Ferrari boss Luca di Montezemolo signed both 1973 BRM drivers, Clay Regazzoni and Niki Lauda. Ex-Ferrari driver Arturo Merzario found a seat at Williams (entered as Iso-Marlboro), while BRM hired Henri Pescarolo and Francois Migault next to Jean-Pierre Beltoise who had stayed.
* After Francois Cevert had died and Jackie Stewart retired, Tyrrell signed Jody Scheckter from McLaren and Formula Two driver Patrick Depailler.
* Ex-McLaren driver Peter Revson found a seat at Shadow next to Jean-Pierre Jarier, coming from March. After having driven part-time for them in 1973, Jochen Mass drove a full season for Surtees.
* Wilson Fittipaldi had left Brabham to prepare and set up his own F1 team for 1974. Richard Robarts paid to take up the seat at the British team.
* March promoted their F2 driver Hans-Joachim Stuck to their F1 team, next to Howden Ganley from Williams.
* Graham Hill&#x27;s Embassy Racing entered a Lola chassis after running a Shadow in 1973. The Hesketh team entered its self-made chassis after running a privatised March last year.

====Mid-season changes====
During the season, five teams debuted with their self-made chassis:
* In the Spanish Grand Prix, Chris Amon debuted with his first own chassis, but later, gave up the effort for a drive at BRM.
* In the same race, Trojan-Tauranac Racing hired Tim Schenken to drive their car that was a development from their Formula 5000 chassis.
* Token Racing (the name inspired by the owners&#x27; first names, Tony and Ken) made their debut at the Belgian Grand Prix with Tom Pryce at the wheel.
* Famous America racing team Penske entered the Canadian and United States GP&#x27;s with their own chassis. Mark Donohue was hired to drive.
* In the same two races, Parnelli Jones entered a car inspired by the Lotus 72, financially supported by Firestone, and future champion Mario Andretti at the wheel.

These are some of the mid-season driver changes:
* After two races, March replaced Howden Ganley with Formula Two driver Vittorio Brambilla.
* Peter Revson was killed during practice for the South African Grand Prix when his Shadow suffered suspension failure and crashed into the armco barrier. Shadow subsequently hired F5000 driver Brian Redman, F2 driver Bertil Roos, and Tom Pryce, who had made his debut with Token earlier in the year.
* Richard Robarts was let go by Brabham when a better-funded Rikky von Opel came in. Carlos Pace moved up from Surtees to finish the season at Brabham.
* Mike Hailwood left F1 after heavily crashing his McLaren at the German Grand Prix. David Hobbs returned to F1 after three years to take over, before Jochen Mass moved up from Surtees.
* Helmut Koinigg was killed during the United States Grand Prix in an accident reminiscent of Cevert&#x27;s accident at the same track the year before. When his car hit the barrier, it split on impact, and Koinigg was decapitated. Surtees decreased their operations to one car for the next season.

==Calendar==
=== Calendar changes ===
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from Montjuïc to Jarama, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the Belgian Grand Prix was moved from Circuit Zolder to Nivelles-Baulers, and the British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was moved up from late July to mid June.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Charade to the newly built Dijon-Prenois circuit.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
Selfseal breakaway fuel couplings were mandated to reduce the chance of a fire in accidents.

===Sporting regulations===
* The 1974 season was the first in which teams had permanent racing numbers from race to race, after the system had been instituted in the 1973 Belgian Grand Prix. The numbers were based on the teams&#x27; finishing positions in the 1973 Constructors&#x27; Championship. From this point, each team only changed numbers if they had the driver who had won the World Drivers&#x27; Championship – the winning driver taking the number 1 and his teammate the number 2, and the team that had previously had those numbers switching to the newly vacated ones. (This made 1974 an anomaly, as there was no World Champion, since Jackie Stewart had retired. Ronnie Peterson took the number 1 as he was team leader at Constructors&#x27; Champion Lotus; when the situation arose again in 1993 and 1994, the number 0 was used). This system meant that, for example, Tyrrell – who never again won either title – maintained the numbers 3 and 4 right through until the system was changed in 1996.
* For the first time, it was mandated precisely how drivers should line up on the grid before the start of the race: in a two-by-two staggered pattern, with 12 between each row of two cars.

==Season report==
===Race 1: Argentina===
In qualifying for the opening round in Argentina, Ronnie Peterson took pole in his Lotus ahead of Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Ferrari and Emerson Fittipaldi&#x27;s McLaren. Peterson led at the start, whereas fellow front-row starter Regazzoni spun, causing chaos. Fittipaldi was hit by teammate Mike Hailwood and lost two laps while repairing his car, and James Hunt inherited second whereas Peter Revson, who started fourth, retired in the chaos. Hunt spun before the first lap was over, and second place went to Carlos Reutemann&#x27;s Brabham.

Reutemann passed Peterson on the third lap, and soon the Swede began to fade badly with brake problems. As a result, Mike Hailwood and Denny Hulme in their McLarens were second and third, ahead of Jacky Ickx and Niki Lauda in the second Lotus and Ferrari. Hulme, Ickx and Lauda all passed Hailwood and then Ickx suffered a puncture mid-race and had to pit. Regazzoni was recovering from his spin, and passed Hailwood soon after. Reutemann continued to lead until his engine began to misfire, with Hulme closing in and taking the lead on the penultimate lap. Hulme went on to win, with Lauda and Regazzoni completing the podium after Reutemann ran out of fuel on the last lap.

===Race 2: Brazil===
Fittipaldi took a popular home pole in Brazil, beating Reutemann and Lauda. Reutemann, eager to make up after his bad luck in Argentina, took the lead at the start, with Peterson up to second. Reutemann led early on, but was passed by both Peterson and Fittipaldi on lap 4. Peterson battled with former Lotus teammate Fittipaldi for the next 12 laps, until he suffered a slow puncture. Fittipaldi passed him and took the lead, whereas Peterson dropped backwards. Fittipaldi went on to take a home victory, with Regazzoni getting second and Ickx third.

===Race 3: South Africa===
The field went to South Africa after a two-month break. Lauda took pole position, with Carlos Pace&#x27;s Surtees also on the front row. Arturo Merzario in the Iso-Marlboro team was an amazing third on the grid. At the start, Lauda took the lead, whereas surprise packages Pace and Merzario were soon swamped by the field. Reutemann was up to second, and he took the lead from Lauda on the tenth lap, and he would remain ahead for the rest of the afternoon. Regazzoni was third ahead of Fittipaldi and Hailwood, but soon Jean-Pierre Beltoise&#x27;s BRM soon passed the two McLarens, as Fittipaldi began to drop back. Lauda and Regazzoni both retired very late in the race when their engines blew up, and thus Beltoise and Hailwood completed the podium behind Reutemann.

===Race 4: Spain===
The first European round of the championship was in Spain, and it was Lauda who took pole ahead of Peterson and Regazzoni. On race day, the track was wet but drying, and Peterson was able to beat Lauda off the line. Regazzoni and Ickx followed. The Lotuses and the Ferraris battled until Peterson&#x27;s engine failed and Ickx lost a wheel which was not fastened properly after the stop for slicks. This left Lauda to take his first career win, and Regazzoni to complete a Ferrari 1–2, with Fittipaldi third.

===Race 5: Belgium===
The next race was in Belgium, and Regazzoni continued Ferrari&#x27;s streak of poles, and Jody Scheckter&#x27;s Tyrrell taking second with Lauda third. Regazzoni led in the early stages, with Fittipaldi climbing up to second in the first lap. Later, Lauda passed Scheckter for third, and this became second when Regazzoni went to the grass after an incident with a backmarker. Fittipaldi thus won the race, from Lauda, with Scheckter third after Regazzoni suffered fuel feed problems on the last lap.

===Race 6: Monaco===
In the streets of Monaco, Lauda and Regazzoni took the front row for Ferrari, with Peterson&#x27;s Lotus behind them in third. The Ferraris motored away, with Regazzoni leading after beating his teammate off the line, with Peterson down in sixth. Regazzoni led until he made a mistake and spun off, rejoining fifth. Lauda was now leading Jean-Pierre Jarier&#x27;s Shadow, Peterson and Scheckter. Peterson disposed of Jarier, and took the lead when Lauda&#x27;s engine blew up. Peterson went on to win, with Scheckter taking second from Jarier.

===Race 7: Sweden===
The Tyrrells were dominant in qualifying, with Patrick Depailler taking the pole from Jody Scheckter, with the Ferraris of Lauda and Regazzoni on the second row. Scheckter passed his teammate to take the lead at the start, with Peterson gaining three places to jump up to second. It was all to no avail, because he retired in the opening laps with a driveshaft failure. The Tyrrells were now up front, with the Ferraris behind them. The gearboxes of both Ferraris failed and both retired, promoting James Hunt in the Hesketh to third. Scheckter duly won, with Depailler completing a dominant 1–2 for Tyrrell, with Hunt third.

===Race 8: Netherlands===
The Netherlands was host to the eighth round, and Lauda took his fourth pole of the year, with teammate Regazzoni alongside, and the McLarens of Fittipaldi and Hailwood next up. Lauda led from the start, will Hailwood jumping up to second. But Regazzoni took only two laps to regain second, and Hailwood was soon passed by Depailler and Fittipaldi. Depailler held third until he struggled with oversteer, and so Fittipaldi was through. Lauda won, with Regazzoni making it a 1–2 for Ferrari, with Fittipaldi getting third.

===Race 9: France===
Lauda took pole again in France, with Peterson in second, and Tom Pryce in the Shadow a surprising third. Lauda and Peterson maintained their positions at the start, whereas Pryce collided with Hunt and Carlos Reutemann, with all three retiring as Regazzoni took third. Lauda and Peterson battled it out in the early stages, but soon Lauda began to suffer from a vibration and Peterson was able to pass him and pull away. Peterson went on to win, with Lauda managing second, and Regazzoni third.

===Race 10: Great Britain===
Great Britain was host to the tenth round of the championship, and Lauda surprised no one by taking pole, with Peterson again alongside and Scheckter third. At the start, Lauda led, whereas Peterson dropped behind Scheckter and Regazzoni. The order of Lauda, Scheckter, Regazzoni and Peterson remained unchanged for the first half of the race until Regazzoni and Peterson had to pit for new tyres after running over debris. Late in the race, leader Lauda suffered a puncture, and the lead went to Scheckter. Scheckter duly won, with Fittipaldi getting second and Jacky Ickx third.

As a result, with exactly two-thirds of the championship gone, the championship was an extremely close four-way battle. Lauda led with 38 points, but he was only a point ahead of Fittipaldi, with Regazzoni and Scheckter lurking three points behind.

===Race 11: Germany===
The third part of the championship started in Germany at the 14.2 mile (22.8 km) Nürburgring circuit, and Lauda took pole as usual, and Regazzoni ensured that Ferrari locked out the front row, with other contenders Fittipaldi third and Scheckter fourth. Regazzoni took the lead at the start, whereas Lauda and Scheckter collided on the first lap at the Nord Kurve with the former retiring, and the latter continuing unscathed in second. Fittipaldi suffered a puncture and had to pit. Regazzoni went on to win and take the championship lead, with Scheckter second and Reutemann third.

===Race 12: Austria===
Lauda took his eighth pole position of the championship, and fifth consecutive, in his home round in Austria with Reutemann and Fittipaldi second and third on the grid. Reutemann got the better of Lauda at the start, with Regazzoni fourth behind the second Brabham of Carlos Pace, and Fittipaldi down to seventh behind Scheckter. Scheckter retired with a blown engine, whereas Regazzoni soon passed Pace. Lauda soon dropped down the order with a misfiring engine and soon retired. Regazzoni was second, and Fittipaldi was third after passing Pace. However. Fittipaldi&#x27;s engine also blew up, and Regazzoni dropped back and ultimately had to bit with a slow puncture. Reutemann took the victory, with Denny Hulme second and James Hunt third. Regazzoni recovered to finish fifth and get two points, whereas his other rivals scored none.

===Race 13: Italy===
The Ferrari fans were happy to see Lauda take pole for the Italian GP, with the Brabhams of Reutemann and Pace following him on the grid. The start did not change the positions, with Lauda leading Reutemann and Pace. Soon, Regazzoni passed both the Brabhams to and then Reutemann retired with a gearbox failure and Pace had to pit with tyre troubles. This left Lauda leading Regazzoni for the perfect Ferrari 1–2, a long way ahead of third-placed Peterson. That was not to last as Lauda retired with a water leak, handing the lead to Regazzoni but Regazzoni&#x27;s engine failed 10 laps later. Peterson took the lead and won, holding off Fittipaldi and Scheckter finished third to close up the championship.

===Race 14: Canada===
The penultimate round of the championship was in Canada, and Fittipaldi took pole, just beating Lauda with Scheckter third. Lauda took Fittipaldi off the line and led, with Regazzoni up to third ahead of Scheckter, but Scheckter retook the position on the second lap. The four contenders were occupying the first four spots – Lauda leading Fittipaldi, Scheckter and Regazzoni. But Scheckter crashed after suffering a brake failure, and then Lauda crashed out late in the race after running over debris, ending his championship hopes. Fittipaldi won the race from Regazzoni, with Peterson completing the podium.

This meant that Fittipaldi and Regazzoni were level on points into the last race, with Scheckter the outsider seven points behind.

===Race 15: United States===
The championship decider was to be held at the United States. Reutemann took pole with Hunt alongside on the front row, with home hero Mario Andretti third in a Parnelli. Scheckter was sixth, whereas Fittipaldi and Regazzoni were eighth and ninth. Reutemann converted his pole to a lead at the start, with Hunt second and Pace third after Andretti stalled. Behind Lauda was Scheckter, Fittipaldi and Regazzoni running together. The front three quickly pulled away, as Lauda held up Scheckter and Fittipaldi in an attempt to help Regazzoni. However, Regazzoni was struggling with handling problems and dropping back down the field. He pitted for tyres twice but found it to be no avail, and he was two laps down. Lauda and Scheckter both retired in the latter half of the race, promoting Fittipaldi to fourth. Pace took second from Hunt with four laps left, as the Englishman was suffering from fading brakes. The race was won by Reutemann, with Pace ensuring that Brabham cap off the season with a 1–2, and Hunt was third.

Emerson Fittipaldi finished fourth to ensure that he was the World Champion, beating Regazzoni by three points.

The race was marred by the death of young Austrian Helmut Koinigg when his car crashed into the wall after a puncture on the 10th lap. The barrier which the car hit split on impact, and Koinigg was decapitated.

<text>The 1973 Formula One season was the 27th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1973 World Championship of Drivers and the 1973 International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, which were contested concurrently over a fifteen-race series that commenced on 28 January and ended on 7 October. The season also included two non-championship races which were open to both Formula One and Formula 5000 cars.
The World Championship of Drivers was won by Jackie Stewart, driving for Elf Team Tyrrell, for the third time. The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers was awarded to John Player Team Lotus. At the final race of the season, Stewart&#x27;s teammate Francois Cevert crashed during Saturday practice and was killed instantly. The Tyrrell team withdrew from the race, handing the Manufacturers&#x27; title to Lotus. Subsequently, Stewart made public his decision to retire, but he had decided on this already earlier.
British driver Roger Williamson was also killed during the season, in a tragic crash at the Dutch Grand Prix where marshals arrived too late on the scene and fellow driver David Purley was unable to free Williamson from the burning wreck.

== Drivers and constructors ==
The following teams and drivers contested the 1973 World Championship.


===Team and driver changes===
There were relatively few changes in the top teams, but no less than usual further down the order:
* The factory-backed Matra team had withdrawn from Formula One. They had already reduced their operations to one car before the season and, after the season, packed up all-together.
* With backing from Universal Oil Products and technical support from ex-BRM designer Tony Southgate, the Can-Am team Shadow Racing Cars entered the 1973 Formula One season. Shadow brought their Can-Am driver Jackie Oliver with them and signed 1972 Can-Am champion George Follmer. Finally, they sold a chassis to Graham Hill&#x27;s new own team Embassy Racing.
* Lotus signed Ronnie Peterson from March.
* Hill had moved from Brabham, where Andrea de Adamich took his place. The Italian came from Surtees, where Carlos Pace found a new home.
* After Pace and Henri Pescarolo left, Frank Williams had to find two new drivers: Howden Ganley from BRM and Nanni Galli from Tecno. Tecno signed Matra&#x27;s last driver, Chris Amon.
* BRM signed Clay Regazzoni and Niki Lauda, next to Jean-Pierre Beltoise. This was a golden trio of drivers, but they would only manage to gain twelve points and the team finished seventh in the Manufacturers&#x27; championship. A slight consolidation for Regazzoni, who had left Ferrari over the winter, was that the Italian squad finished just one place higher, on the same amount of points.
* After Peterson and Lauda had left March, they signed Jean-Pierre Jarier. He was due to drive for them in Formula Two, but was given a Formula One seat as well. His F1 season would turn out difficult, only classifying once during the year, but he managed to rack up the Formula Two title in dominant fashion.

====Mid-season changes====
* Future world champion James Hunt debuted at the Monaco Grand Prix, driving a privateer March 731 entered by Hesketh Racing. It was also the team&#x27;s championship debut.
* Also debuting that race was David Purley for LEC Refrigeration Racing, his own team sponsored by his family&#x27;s refrigeration company. Like Hunt, he hired a March 731. Sadly, he is mostly known for his failed rescue attempt of Roger Williamson (see below). The LEC team returned with their own chassis in .
* After five races, Nanni Galli announced his retirement. His place at the team of Frank Williams was taken up by seven different drivers in the remaining part of the season.
* 1972 British F3 champion Rikky von Opel commissioned a Formula One chassis for his F3 team Ensign. They debuted in the French Grand Prix.
* The British Grand Prix saw the debut of two-time British F3 champion Roger Williamson. In only his second race, the Dutch Grand Prix, he crashed and died in the subsequent fire.
* Rolf Stommelen returned to Formula One to take the place of Andrea de Adamich at Brabham. The Italian was heavily injured in a pile-up at Silverstone. It took thirty minutes to extract him from his car.
* The Tecno team folded with three races to go, after several disputes created a toxic atmosphere. Driver Chris Amon moved to Tyrrell and started preparations for his own racing team.

==Calendar==
=== Calendar changes ===
The calendar was expanded from 12 to 15 races:
* The Brazilian Grand Prix was held for the first time, at Autodromo de Interlagos, and the Swedish Grand Prix was held for the first time, at the Scandinavian Raceway in Anderstorp.
* The Dutch Grand Prix returned to the calendar after it had been cancelled in due to safety upgrades that were not completed in time. The upgrades included new asphalt, new barriers, a change in the circuit&#x27;s layout and a new race control tower.
Other changes:
* The Belgian Grand Prix and Monaco Grand Prix swapped places on the calendar so that the Monaco round came second. The Belgian round also carried the unofficial title of European Grand Prix for 1973.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from Jarama near Madrid to the Montjuïc street circuit in Barcelona, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the Belgian Grand Prix was moved from Nivelles-Baulers to Circuit Zolder, and the British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Charade Circuit to Paul Ricard Circuit.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* The minimum weight was increased from to .

===Sporting regulations===
* Drivers would do a full warm-up lap before the race. Previously, they would form a &quot;dummy grid&quot;, a short distance behind an official grid, and the cars would simply move from one to the other to begin the race.
* The numbering system for teams was formalised:
** From the second race of the season on, teammates were paired: the Lotus drivers were given 1 and 2, Tyrrell&#x27;s drivers 3 and 4, and so on. The numbers assigned to each team did still change for a couple of races.
** Ahead of the fifth race on the calendar, the order was set for the rest of the year.
** And then for the 1974 season, the numbers were assigned based on finishing positions in the 1973 Manufacturers&#x27; championship. After this, teams did not change numbers, unless they won the Drivers&#x27; championship or signed the reigning Drivers&#x27; champion, or if they or another team dropped out of the competition.
* The 1973 season saw the intervention of a Safety Car in Formula One for the first time, in the form of a Porsche 914 at the Canadian Grand Prix. However, the concept of a safety car would not be officially introduced until twenty years later, in .

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 4===

Like last year, the championship commenced in January in Argentina. Swiss driver Clay Regazzoni had left Ferrari after three years, having scored just one podium finish in . He was attracted by the Marlboro-sponsored British Racing Motors team for &quot;an astronomical fee&quot; and delivered early success: he qualified on pole position, ahead of reigning champion Emerson Fittipaldi in the Lotus and last year&#x27;s teammate Jacky Ickx. But on Sunday, it was sixth-starting François Cevert that took his rivals by surprise: he snatched the lead even before the first corner, before being passed by the pole sitter later in the lap. For the first quarter of the race, five drivers formed a tight leading pack: Regazzoni, Cevert, Fittipaldi, new Lotus driver Ronnie Peterson and champion Jackie Stewart. But then, with his Firestone tyres overheating, Regazzoni fell back to fifth, while Stewart&#x27;s conservative start allowed him to get up to second place. Going into the tail end of the race, Fittipaldi overtook Stewart, much to the joy of the South American fans, and set a new lap record in his chase for Cevert. After 50 laps in the lead, the Frenchman had to surrender first position and eventually finished 5 seconds behind his Brazilian rival. Stewart came home in third.
After an inspired promotional campaign, São Paulo were selected to host the first ever World Championship Brazilian Grand Prix. Team Lotus dominated practice and qualified 1–2, but it was Peterson ahead of Fittipaldi. Ickx started next to them in third. The Tyrrells of Stewart and Cevert could only managed eighth and ninth, respectively. At the start, however, the Scot jumped up to third, behind Fittipaldi and another local hero with a good start, Carlos Pace. Peterson fell back to fourth and then, on lap 6, had a crash due to high right rear wheel collapsing. Pace then retired with suspension damage. Fittipaldi finished with a comfortable lead over Stewart. McLaren driver Denny Hulme was third.
Staying on the southern hemisphere but moving almost on, Kyalami hosted the South African Grand Prix. In practice, Jackie Stewart was going faster and faster until he suffered a dramatic brake failure and spun backwards through three layers of chain link fence. He was unhurt, so his biggest grief came from being unable to defend his time: with the first thirteen drivers separated by less than a second, the Scot was relegated to the sixteenth place on the grid. Denny Hulme achieved pole position, ahead of Emerson Fittipaldi and local driver Jody Scheckter. The start of the race was rather calm, but on lap 3, Clay Regazzoni crashed into a stationary Mike Hailwood. Both cars burst into flames and Regazzoni was unconscious. Hailwood did not hesitate to rescue him and managed to release the Swiss driver&#x27;s seat belts. His overalls caught on fire, so he turned to a marshal with a fire extinguisher and then continued to drag Regazzoni from the wrecked BRM. Meanwhile, leader Hulme had to pit twice with punctures, but Stewart was performing a miraculous recovery drive: he was up to sixth place on lap 6, and was leading the race on lap 7. American driver Peter Revson in his McLaren overtook Fittipaldi for second place and managed to stay there. Scheckter retired with just four laps to go. At least three drivers reported Stewart for overtaking under yellow flags and McLaren&#x27;s team boss filed the official protest. The stewards handed the Scot a severe reprimand but the race results were upheld.
The Spanish Grand Prix was held on Barcelona&#x27;s street circuit that combined tight hairpins with high-speed blind corners, resulting in average speeds of over . Peterson qualified on pole position, ahead of Hulme and Cevert. Stewart and Fittipaldi started fourth and seventh, respectively. Around a quarter distance, Hulme and Cevert had to pit with damage and the Swede at the front achieved a comfortable lead. On lap 55, however, his gearbox failed and his Lotus ground to a halt. Stewart retired with brake problems and Fittipaldi endured a slow puncture. Carlos Reutemann, smelling a sudden victory, was chasing down his fellow Brazilian until his driveshaft failed. So the championship leader held on to victory, ahead of François Cevert for Tyrrell and George Follmer in the Shadow.
In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Emerson Fittipaldi (31 points) held a sizable lead over Jackie Stewart (19) and François Cevert (12). Lotus (31 points) was leading in the standings for the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup, ahead of Tyrrell (27) and McLaren (15).

===Rounds 5 to 8===
The Belgian Grand Prix was held at Circuit Zolder for the first time, as part of the 1972 agreement to alternate with Nivelles-Baulers. The track was prepared for the event too late and after an hour of practice, the drivers&#x27; union (GPDA) were threatening with a strike action, complaining that the tarmac was breaking up. After a quick resurfacing job on Friday evening, the track held together during Saturday practice, but now was very slippery, and there was a lot of sand off the racing line. Ronnie Peterson qualified his Lotus on pole position and held the lead at the start, but was passed by fourth-starting François Cevert (Tyrrell) on the second lap. Championship rivals Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell) and Emerson Fittipaldi (Lotus) had started in sixth and ninth, respectively, but quickly charged through the field. After Cevert spun off on lap 20 and rejoined down in eighth, they were fighting for the lead, with the Scot coming out on top. When Fittipaldi had to slow with fuel pressure problems, he had to settle for third, while Cevert recovered to second position.

The Monaco Grand Prix was held on a heavily revised circuit, the layout becoming even twistier and slower than before. Stewart qualified on pole position, ahead of Peterson, but it was Cevert who took the lead at the start. Clay Regazzoni moved his BRM ahead of Stewart, going up from eighth to third, and this became second when Cevert hit a kerbstone and punctured his tyre. On lap 6, however, he locked up coming out of the tunnel and had to make a pit stop. Now Stewart could start chasing down Peterson. When the Swede&#x27;s Lotus started suffering from dropping fuel pressure, the lead was easily taken and Stewart steadily increased his lead. Fittipaldi got by his teammate for second position, but did not manage to put up a real fight with Stewart. The pair finished within 1.3 seconds of each other, while they lapped the rest of the field, making abudantly clear that they would be the championship contenders for this year.
The F1 circus arrived at Anderstorp Raceway for the first Swedish Grand Prix and it was local hero Ronnie Peterson who qualified on pole position, ahead of François Cevert. Stewart and Fittipaldi started on the second row. At the start, Fittipaldi got up to second and so, the two Lotuses were leading the two Tyrrells. On lap 33, Stewart passed his teammate, who fell further back behind Denny Hulme in miscommunication with a lapped car. The McLaren driver was on a real charge and rejoiced in his rivals&#x27; troubles: Fittipaldi&#x27;s brakes were fading before his gearbox packed up all together, Stewart lost drive and Peterson had worn out his tyres. Hulme won his first Grand Prix, ahead of Peterson and Cevert. Stewart was a lucky man finishing in fifth and salvaging two points for the championship.

Circuit Paul Ricard played host to the French Grand Prix, combining two twisty sections with the long Mistral Straight. Stewart qualified on pole, ahead of a surprising Jody Scheckter in just his third F1 race, and championship leader Fittipaldi. Scheckter made the quickest getaway and was followed by fifth-starting Peterson. Astonishingly, Scheckter led the field for 42 laps. While lapping a backmarker, however, the South African was hit from behind by now-second placed Fittipaldi. Both cars broke their left front suspension. Peterson picked up the scraps to take his first Grand Prix victory, ahead of Cevert and Reuteman. Stewart came home in fourth, scoring less points than usual, but important points nonetheless.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jackie Stewart (42 points) had just overtaken Emerson Fittipaldi (41), while François Cevert was third (31). The Manufacturers&#x27; Cup was being fought just as closely by Lotus (52 points) and Tyrrell (51), ahead of McLaren (26) in a distant third.

===Rounds 9 to 11===
Going into the second half of the championship, the British Grand Prix was held at the fast Silverstone Circuit. The cars were expected to hit average speeds of nearly . Fans and rivals were eager to see the pace of Jody Scheckter, after he was robbed of an apparent victory in France. The South African could manage a sixth starting place. Pole position was for Ronnie Peterson (Lotus), with Denny Hulme and Peter Revson (both McLarens) next to him. Championship rivals Jackie Stewart and Emerson Fittipaldi filled the second row of the grid. At the start, Stewart shot up to take the lead, ahead of Peterson and eighth-starting Reutemann. Going through Woodcote corner for the first time, Scheckter lost the back end of his McLaren, hit the pit wall and came to a halt in the middle of the track. Revson hit Scheckter&#x27;s rear wing and another nine cars came together in a pile-up. The race was suspended (only the second time in history that had happened) while marshals extracated Andrea de Adamich from the wreckage with a broken ankle. Ninety minutes after the first start, the race got underway again and Peterson led from Lauda and Stewart. The Scot quickly got up to second and then tried his luck for first, but spun on the kerb. When Lauda made a pit stop, Fittipaldi was second, until he was hit with a transmission failure. During a short rain shower, Peterson lost the lead to Revson and the American managed to win his first Grand Prix. Hulme was third, ahead of future champion James Hunt in fourth.
Scuderia Ferrari had decided to withdraw from the Dutch Grand Prix to focus on upgrading their cars, seeing that they had played no part in the championship so far this year. Fittipaldi crashed during Saturday practice when his left front wheel broke coming on to the start-finish straight. His ankles were badly bruised. His teammate Peterson qualified on pole for the sixth time this season, ahead of Stewart and Cevert (Tyrrell). The top two remained the same at the start, but eighth-starting Carlos Pace took the place of Cevert in third. Fittipaldi had started the race but pitted on the second lap and was helped out of his car. On lap 8, Roger Williamson crashed his March at the same corner as Piers Courage in . He was trapped in his overturned and burning car. With the crash taking place at the far end of the track, no one of the marshals understood this, instead mistaking David Purley, having abandoned his race to rescue Williamson, for the driver that had crashed, and they tried to drag him away. The race, meanwhile, continued and Peterson&#x27;s lead grew ever bigger, until on lap 40, his engine was losing speed. He eventually retired on lap 66. Stewart took his fourth victory of the season ahead of Cevert and Hunt, the future champion&#x27;s claiming his first podium finish. Local driver Gijs van Lennep finished sixth and scored a point as well.

The fearsome Nürburgring Nordschleife constituted the arena for the German Grand Prix. Stewart started on pole, ahead of Peterson and Cevert. Fittipaldi was down in fourteenth, still recovering from his injuries. Peterson retired halfway through the first lap and the Tyrrells were unchallenged. Jacky Ickx was third for McLaren. Future champion Niki Lauda had crashed on the second lap, completely demolishing his BRM and breaking his wrist.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Emerson Fittipaldi (42 points) had fallen down to third after a streak of four races without points. Jackie Stewart (60) was leading teammate François Cevert (45). Tyrrell (71 points) had also taken a firm grip on the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup over Lotus (59) and McLaren (42).

===Rounds 12 to 15===
Lotus were not giving up their hunt for the title: Emerson Fittipaldi and Ronnie Peterson qualified 1-2 for the Austrian Grand Prix. Their rivals at Tyrrell, Jackie Stewart and François Cevert, started seventh and tenth, respectively. Denny Hulme (McLaren) started third but overtook Fittipaldi before the first corner. On lap 4, Stewart overtook Arturo Merzario for fourth place. Cevert tried the same on lap 6, but hit the Ferrari and had to retire with a damaged wishbone. Hulme had to pit when he lost a cylinder. Fittipaldi was allowed to pass Peterson to keep his championship fight alive, but on lap 48, his engine suddenly died. His fuel line had come loose and it meant another retirement for the champion. Peterson won, ahead of Stewart and Pace.

If Stewart would manage to finish third or higher in the Italian Grand Prix, he would clinch the Drivers&#x27; Championship. A lower points finish would almost necessitate Fittipaldi to win and Cevert to get on the podium to stay in the championship fight. It was Peterson who claimed his seventh pole position of the season, ahead of the McLarens of Peter Revson and Denny Hulme. Stewart started in sixth, with his teammate and closest rival Cevert in eleventh. Fittipaldi started in fourth but was second before the first corner. Stewart got up to that vital fourth position, until he had to pit with a flat rear tyre. He rejoined in nineteenth, but by half distance, he was up in eighth place. With seven laps to go, he overtook his teammate for fourth position, so Fittipaldi would have to win the race. However, Peterson stayed ahead and Fittipaldi finished second ahead of Revson. Stewart was awarded the 1973 Drivers&#x27; Championship.

For the Canadian Grand Prix, Peterson started on pole, ahead of Revson and Scheckter. A heavy shower fell before the start and all-but-one drivers started on full wet tyres. After the start, Peterson was leading Scheckter and Lauda, while Revson fell back to seventh. Lauda was comfortable in the wet conditions and actually grabbed the lead on lap 4. Peterson crashed out on lap 16, before the track dried up and everyone started coming into the pits. The race organisers got confused with the order of the cars, even more when Scheckter and Cevert crashed and, as was agreed after the Dutch Grand Prix, the pace car was deployed. No one, however, knew for sure who was in the lead and the pace car driver picked up Howden Ganley as such. After ten laps, during which the track had completely dried, the field was released and Ganley hold off Stewart and Fittipaldi for eight laps. Post-race analysis showed that, actually, Jackie Oliver lost the lead on that lap to Peter Revson. Lotus team boss Colin Chapman believed Fittipaldi won after passing Ganley, but three hours after the race finished, Revson was declared the winner, with Fittipaldi in second and Oliver in third.
The 1973 season ended on a low-point when François Cevert crashed during practice for the United States Grand Prix and was killed on impact. Tyrrell withdrew from the event, giving up the Manufacturers&#x27; Title to Lotus. Peterson started on pole for the ninth time this year, ahead of Reutemann and Fittipaldi. Future champion Hunt in his little March passed Fittipaldi and Reutemann and came within a second of Peterson. The Swede held on to take his third win in four races, ahead of hero-of-the-day Hunt and Reutemann.

The Drivers&#x27; Championship was awarded to Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell, 71 points), ahead of Emerson Fittipaldi (Lotus, 55) and Ronnie Peterson (Lotus, 52). The Manufacturers&#x27; Cup was won by Lotus (92 points), ahead of Tyrrell (82) and McLaren (58).

<doc id="1140088" wikidata="Q69267" url="?curid=1140088" title="1972 Formula One season">
<text>The 1972 Formula One season was the 26th season of the FIA&#x27;s Formula One motor racing. It featured the 23rd World Championship of Drivers, the 15th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers, and numerous non-championship Formula One races. The World Championship commenced on 23 January and ended on 8 October after twelve races.

Emerson Fittipaldi, driving for Lotus, became the youngest World Champion to date at 25 years. This record would stand until Fernando Alonso&#x27;s title in . Reigning champion Jackie Stewart came second in the championship. The Lotus team had finished fifth in the standings of , but kept developing their innovative Lotus 72 &quot;wedge&quot; design to take a surprise championship victory. The car sported a striking black and gold livery for their sponsor Imperial Tobacco had introduced a new brand of John Player Special cigarettes.

The British Racing Motors (BRM) team took its last victory when Jean-Pierre Beltoise won the rain-affected 1972 Monaco Grand Prix in a BRM P160.

== Drivers and constructors ==
The following teams and drivers contested the 1972 World Championship.

===Team and driver changes===
* BRM hired Reine Wisell from Lotus and Jean-Pierre Beltoise from Matra. The team had lost Jo Siffert when he died during the 1971 World Championship Victory Race at Brands Hatch. Still, they were a popular outfit and managed to field no less than five cars in the opening race of the championship.
* After a collaboration with McLaren in , Alfa Romeo had worked with March in . Both campaigns were unsuccessful and the Italian firm pulled out of the sport. (They would return with Brabham in .) March promoted their Formula Two driver Niki Lauda to the F1 team, while the Austrian kept racing in F2 as well.
* At Lotus, Emerson Fittipaldi was joined by David Walker, while McLaren signed 1971 Can-Am champion Peter Revson. They had previously worked together for the 1971 Indianapolis 500.
* Matra reduced their operations to just one car, after Beltoise moved to BRM.
* The Surtees team signed Tim Schenken from Brabham and Andrea de Adamich from March. Mike Hailwood was promoted to a full-time drive while still driving in Formula Two. He would actually win the F2 title this year. Owner John Surtees would shift focus to his management role and retired from racing at the end of the season.
* Brabham, in the hands of new managing director Bernie Ecclestone, promoted their F2 driver Carlos Reutemann to race besides veteran Graham Hill. Wilson Fittipaldi Júnior paid his way to a third Brabham seat.
* Starting his third year as a team owner in F1, Frank Williams gained sponsorship from French oil company Motul, with which he was able to buy a new March 721 for his driver Henri Pescarolo. He also promoted his F2 driver Carlos Pace to the team, giving him previous year&#x27;s March 711. The Williams team tried out with a Politoys FX3, but the car&#x27;s steering failed on the first run, during the British Grand Prix, and the chassis was heavily damaged.

====Mid-season changes====
* Günther Hennerici, owner of the caravan manufacturing company Eifelland, married Formula Two driver Hannelore Werner. Together, they set up a racing team that competed in the 1971 German Formula Three Championship, before expanding to F1 in 1972. From the second race of the season on, they entered a redesigned March 721 under the Eifelland name and signed Rolf Stommelen from Surtees. Before the season was over, however, they withdrew from the championship and refocussed their efforts on Formula Three.
* Tecno was a successful Italian karting and racing team. With sponsorship from Martini, they built their own F1 chassis and entered the 1972 championship from the Belgian Grand Prix on. They signed Nanni Galli, coming from the March team.
* The Connew Racing Team had the intent to enter and compete in the whole 1972 season, but only managed to start the Austrian Grand Prix, with French driver Francois Migault at the wheel. They converted their self-made chassis to meet Formula 5000 regulations for 1973, but at the end of that year, the car was crashed beyond repair and the team folded.

==Calendar==
=== Calendar changes ===
* The Argentine Grand Prix returned to the calendar in 1972, for the first time since . The Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez would be used again.
* The Belgian Grand Prix returned as well, after the race was cancelled because of the failure to bring Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps up to mandatory safety standards. The 1972 race was held at the Nivelles-Baulers circuit.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from Montjuïc to Jarama, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the French Grand Prix was moved from Circuit Paul Ricard to the Charade Circuit and the British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch.

====Cancelled rounds====
* F1 intended to organise a second Grand Prix in the United States, dubbed the United States Grand Prix West, at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles. It would be the third race on the calendar on 9 April. The FIA demanded the circuit&#x27;s owners to hold a test event first, but they did not comply and the event was cancelled.
* The Dutch Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 18 June, between the Belgian and French Grand Prix, but was cancelled because of safety upgrades that were not completed at the Circuit Zandvoort in time for the race, due to lack of funds.
* The Mexican Grand Prix was scheduled on 22 October, to be the last race of the championship, but it was cancelled after local interest dissipated after the death of Pedro Rodríguez in a sportscar crash in 1971.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* The minimum weight was raised from to .
* Like it was from to , cars running a compressed engine, for example with a turbocharger, could now have a displacement of . (For the two years in between, it was reduced to .) The maximum displacement for naturally aspirated engines remained at .

===Safety measures===
Safety was becoming a serious talking point in F1. Since , circuits had started installing some safety features. 1972 was the first season in which all the visited tracks were up to the mandatory safety standards. The official &quot;Circuit Safety Criteria&quot; were published, including, for example, specifications on debris fences.

On the cars, some safety measures were made mandatory as well:
* the fuel tanks had to be lined with &quot;safety foam&quot;,
* no magnesium sheet could be less than thick,
* the driver had to have a headrest,
* minimum dimensions were set for the cockpit,
* the driver had to be secured by a 6-point harness,
* a single switch was designed to cut off the electronical components on the car and to set off the fire extinguisher,
* a 15W red light needed to be installed at the rear of the car.

===Sporting regulations===
The first &quot;Drivers&#x27; Code of Conduct&quot; was published.

==Championship report==

===Rounds 1 to 4===

When Formula One returned to Argentina for the first time since , it was local driver Carlos Reutemann who made his debut and immediately scored pole position for Brabham. Reigning champion Jackie Stewart started second in his Tyrrell and Peter Revson lined up in third for his first race with McLaren. At the start, Stewart took the lead off of Reutemann, but the Argentine driver kept on his tail. Behind them, Emerson Fittipaldi overtook Denny Hulme for third place, while Revson had fallen back. Reutemann started struggling on his super-soft Goodyear tyres and, by lap 11, he was down to fourth place. Half-way through the race, he made a pit stop and rejoined a lap down. Stewart dominated the pace and went on to win the race, almost half a minute ahead of Hulme and a full minute ahead of the Ferraris of Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni. Fittipaldi had retired with suspension damage.

Stewart secured pole position for the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami, ahead of Regazzoni and Fittipaldi. Hulme got off the line remarkably well: from his fifth position on the grid, he moved up to shortly take the lead, before Stewart regelated him back to second. Regazzoni fell back into the midfield. Veteran Mike Hailwood, driving for Surtees, started fourth but passed Fittipaldi and, later, the overheating McLaren of Hulme, before actually challenging Stewart for the lead. However, on lap 28, his rear suspension collapsed and he had to retire. Stewart then looked set to win, until he suffered a gearbox failure on lap 45 and Fittipaldi inherited the lead. The Brazilian, however, ran into handling problems and saw Hulme go past. Finally, the New Zealander took the chequered flag, ahead of Fittipaldi and Peter Revson.

In Spain, Emerson Fittipaldi was joined on the grid by his brother Wilson, marking the first time two brothers raced simultaneously. Wilson had replaced Carlos Reutemann after the Swiss driver injured his ankle in a Formula 2 race a week earlier. On the Jarama circuit, the Belgian Jacky Ickx took a dominant pole position, seven tenths ahead of Denny Hulme and Emerson Fittipaldi. Stewart started in fourth. On race day, Hulme had another mighty get-away and took the lead, before, like in South Africa, Stewart passed him. Hulme and Ickx were then both passed by Fittipaldi in a miscommunication with a backmarker. By lap 30, it had started raining slightly and Stewart fell back: Fittipaldi and Ickx both passed him. The Brazilian held on to take the victory, while Stewart spun off the track and retired. Since Ickx had set a new lap record and actually lapped his teammate in third place, Fittipaldi&#x27;s win showed that the Lotus 72 was now truly ahead in the development race.

This showed again during qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix, where Fittipaldi took pole position ahead of the Ferraris of Ickx and Regazzoni. Jean-Pierre Beltoise and Peter Gethin started a surprising fourth and fifth for BRM. Before the race, it had started raining and the cars took off in a cloud of spray. Fittipaldi got away slowly, so Ickx jumped ahead, but Beltoise surprised everyone, pulling off a dive to the inside of the first corner and coming out on top. The Marlboro-sponsored BRM was now the only one with a clear view ahead. Just after half-distance, Gethin crashed in the new chicane before Tabac corner and Stewart spun off as well. The Scot, however, regained his podium position when Regazzoni crashed off on a patch of oil. Beltoise held on to what would be his only victory and BRM&#x27;s last. Ickx finished second ahead of Fittipaldi, who overtook Stewart in the end.

In the drivers&#x27; championship, Emerson Fittipaldi (Lotus) led with 19 points, ahead of Jacky Ickx (Ferrari and Denny Hulme (McLaren). Reigning champion Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell) was in fourth. In the manufacturers&#x27; championship, Lotus, McLaren and Ferrari all shared the top spot with 19 points.

===Rounds 5 to 7===
Jackie Stewart was a notable absence in the Belgian Grand Prix. His gruelling schedule of racing in F1, Can-Am and touring cars, as well as promotional events for sponsors Elf and Ford, and a side job as sports commentator on United States television on top of that, resulted in 
a case of gastritis. Under doctor&#x27;s orders, he rested for three weeks and severely restricted his activities after that. Championship leader Emerson Fittipaldi qualified on pole position in the Lotus, ahead of Clay Regazzoni in the Ferrari and Denny Hulme in the McLaren. Regazzoni&#x27;s teammate Jacky Ickx, second in the championship, lined up in fourth, with Francois Cevert, the primary Tyrrell driver for this race, in fifth. At the start, Regazzoni took the lead, but saw Fittipaldi come back past on lap 9. Both Ferraris retired: Ickx with a problem to his accelerator linkage and Regazzoni when he hit backmarker Nanni Galli in the Tecno. The order at the finish of a relatively unexciting race was Fittipaldi, Cevert, Hulme.
The F1 circus moved down to France, where the French Grand Prix was held at the Circuit de Charade, a twisty and undulating stretch of public roads. While Stewart was back in his car, but his teammate Cevert was comfortably fastest in practice. He drove a new-spec Tyrrell chassis, until he crashed into the guard rail, injured his hand, and was left with the old-spec spare car. He would not be the last driver to spin or crash out, trying to get to grips with the challenging circuit. Matra had also brought an upgraded chassis and gave Chris Amon everything he needed to snatch pole position. Hulme and Stewart started behind him. As the race got underway, not much changed in terms of position, but Helmut Marko was hit in the eye by a stone flicked up by Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari. He stopped by the side of the track and was rushed off to hospital. This would mean the end of his racing career. The rough dirt on the track resulted in more trouble: Amon got a flat left-front tyre and a 50-second pit stop left him in ninth position. But he put up a valiant fight and came home in third, behind winner Jackie Stewart and second-placed Emerson Fittipaldi.

Coming to Brands Hatch for the British Grand Prix, Denny Hulme, third in the championship, was recovering from a high-speed crash in the Can-Am race of the week before. He did drive but qualified down in eleventh. Stewart and Amon, heroes of the last race, both crashed in practice and qualified in their spare cars, fourth and seventeenth, respectively. Jacky Ickx got pole position ahead of Emerson Fittipaldi and Peter Revson. At the start, Jean-Pierre Beltoise jumped up to third but quickly started to hold up the pack, which meant that the front two created a big lead over the first few laps. But with Beltoise&#x27;s retirement on lap 22 and the leaders having trouble getting past a backmarker, Jackie Stewart gradually closed up and, on lap 25, managed to overtake Fittipaldi. After the Brazilian got back past, the leading pack stayed in their respective order until Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari started leaking oil and he had to retire on lap 49. Fittipaldi took the win ahead of Stewart and Revson, only the top three finishing on the lead lap. Ronnie Peterson was fourth until his engine and gearbox gave up, he crashed off the road and hit two cars that had retired at the same spot earlier in the race. Chris Amon finished in a surprising fourth position ahead of Denny Hulme.

In the drivers&#x27; championship, Emerson Fittipaldi (Lotus) led with 43 points, ahead of Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell) with 27 and Denny Hulme (McLaren) with 21. The manufacturers&#x27; championship saw Lotus in the lead with 43 points, ahead of Tyrrell with 33 and McLaren with 27.

===Rounds 8 to 10===
The German Grand Prix was held at the most demanding circuit on the calendar: the infamous Nürburgring Nordschleife. In practice, Francois Cevert got air at Pflanzgarten corner and was one of four drivers to crash off the track. All escaped unhurt, but left their respective teams with a lot of repair work. The unofficial lap record was beaten by a full ten seconds on Friday and Ferrari&#x27;s Jacky Ickx went another three seconds faster on Saturday to claim pole position, ahead of championship leaders Jackie Stewart and Emerson Fittipaldi. Ronnie Peterson started in fourth in his March but was second after the start. Clay Regazzoni (Ferrari) got up to third, while Stewart fell back behind Fittipaldi. After two laps of the circuit, Ickx was out of sight of his nearest challengers and kept setting new lap records. Fittipaldi got up to second, but Stewart was stuck in fifth place. When Peterson locked up, Regazzoni and Stewart got by, and they even gained another place when Fittipaldi&#x27;s gearbox blew up and caused an engine fire. On lap 10, Henri Pescarolo suffered an enormous crash at Adenau corner but was unhurt. Ickx&#x27;s engine was losing a bit of power due to a split exhaust manifold, but he won the race with almost a minute to spare. By leading every lap, he actually achieved a grand chelem. On the second-to-last lap, Stewart saw a chance to finally get past Regazzoni, but their wheels touched and the Scot crashed off. So the Ferraris finished 1-2 ahead of Peterson in the March.

The Austrian Grand Prix was held in really hot and sunny conditions. Fittipaldi scored pole position ahead of Regazzoni and Stewart. At the start of the race, they went three-wide into the first corner and it was Stewart who took the lead. Fittipaldi fell back to third but overtook Regazzoni when the Ferrari&#x27;s engine sputtered. The Brazilian gradually closed up to the leader. On lap 23, the lead changed hands and Denny Hulme was challenging for second. Stewart&#x27;s Tyrrell looked to have trouble with its rear suspension and the Scot would eventually finish seventh, over a minute down. Fittipaldi and Hulme fought a close battle, the Lotus crossing the line just over a second ahead of the McLaren. Hulme&#x27;s teammate Peter Revson finished third.
The European leg of the season concluded with the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The circuit had been slowed down by two chicanes, so for once this year, earlier lap records would not be challenged. Jacky Ickx delighted the crowd with a pole position for Ferrari, just 0.04 seconds ahead of Chris Amon in the Matra. Stewart started third, Fittipaldi in sixth. However, seconds after the start, Stewart lost all drive from his engine and had to retire. Ickx and Amon had a trouble-free getaway, while dust on the track left the rest of the field blind into the first corner. No accidents happened but Niki Lauda retired, as the dust had clogged up his March&#x27;s throttle system. Amon fell back to fifth place, promoting Regazzoni to second, and even to first when the Swiss driver passed his teammate for the lead. Francois Cevert retirement on lap 14 left Tyrrell&#x27;s championships hopes seriously diminished. Regazzoni hit Carlos Pace when the Brazilian was recovering from a spin and both cars were out of the race. A lot of drivers retired, including Amon with overheatingbrakes and, on lap 46, leader Jacky Ickx with a failure of all the electrics. Fittipaldi took the win ahead of Hailwood in the Surtees and Hulme in the McLaren.

With an unsurmountable lead of 30 points over his nearest rival, Emerson Fittipaldi clinched the 1972 Drivers&#x27; Championship. At the age of 25, he was the youngest-ever World Champion, a record that would stand until 2005. Denny Hulme (McLaren) had overtaken Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell) in the championship, standing on 31 points compared to 27. Lotus secured the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship since McLaren and Tyrrell were now too far back.

===Rounds 11 and 12===

The McLaren drivers were already familiar with the Mosport International Raceway, host of the Canadian Grand Prix, thanks to their experience in Can-Am. They managed to secure a 1–2 on the grid, Peter Revson ahead of Denny Hulme, with a surprising Ronnie Peterson in third. And it was the Swede that actually reached the first corner first, while Hulme fell back when dirt clogged up his throttle. Coming to complete the first lap, Peterson almost crashed out, and after another mistake a few laps later, he lost the lead to Jackie Stewart. Champion Emerson Fittipaldi was challenging Revson for third. Peterson collided with Graham Hill when trying to lap him. He stopped with a bent steering column and was pushed into the pits. When he rejoined, he found Hill and made clear that the Brit knew how he felt. Peterson was later disqualified for the push up the pits. Fittipaldi fell back with damage to the nose of his car, so on the podium stood Stewart, Revson and Hulme.

Coming to the final race of the championship, the United States Grand Prix, Stewart was determined to show that the loss of the title did not mean a loss of form, and it would be one of the most convincing wins of his career, achieving a hat-trick of pole position, fastest lap and victory. Revson and Hulme started second and third for McLaren. At the start, Revson was caught up in a collision with Regazzoni and Reutemann, so Hulme was up to second and Fittipaldi up to third. Future champion Jody Scheckter was running fourth in his debut race and actually went past the freshly crowned Brazilian, but when a sudden shower arrived, he spun off at the first corner. Stewart was now leading 40 seconds ahead of his teammate Francois Cevert, and then the McLaren of Hulme.

Emerson Fittipaldi finished on top of the standings with 61 points, ahead of Jackie Stewart with 45 and Denny Hulme with 39. In the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, Lotus were first with 61 points. Tyrrell were now second (51), having just overtaken McLaren (47).

<doc id="1140090" wikidata="Q42176" url="?curid=1140090" title="1971 Formula One season">
<text>The 1971 Formula One season was the 25th season of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s Formula One motor racing. It featured the 22nd World Championship of Drivers, the 14th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and a number of non-championship races open to Formula One cars. The World Championship was contested over eleven races between 6 March and 3 October.

Jackie Stewart, driving for Tyrrell Racing, won his second Drivers&#x27; Championship. Tyrrell won their first and only Manufacturers&#x27; Cup. Their car was powered by the famous Cosworth DFV V8, while rivals BRM and Ferrari made use of self-designed V12 engines. 1970 champions Team Lotus had a desultory season after the death of their driver and champion Jochen Rindt, experimenting with a gas turbine engine and four-wheel drive, but ending up just fifth in the standings.

Two Formula One drivers lost their lives this year while racing: Pedro Rodríguez crashed his Ferrari 512 in July, at an Interserie race at the Norisring, and Jo Siffert died in October, in a fiery crash during the Victory Race at Brands Hatch.

This was the first season where at least 22 cars started every championship race, except the Monaco Grand Prix, where 18 cars started.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the championship.

===Team and driver changes===

While Lotus and Tyrrell had kept their line-up from 1970, quite a lot of changes happened further down the field:
* Ferrari signed Mario Andretti next to their 1970 drivers Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni.
* March arrived with a brand new line-up of Ronnie Peterson, who previously drove a privately entered March, Àlex Soler-Roig, for his first full-time drive, and Andrea de Adamich. The Italian drove an Alfa Romeo powered McLaren in 1970 and moved, together with the Alfa Romeo project, to the March team for this year. Peterson and Soler-Roig, meanwhile, kept using the Cosworth DFV engines.
* Jo Siffert moved from March to BRM, next to regular driver Pedro Rodríguez and debutant Howden Ganley.
* Jack Brabham retired from racing and he hired two-time champion Graham Hill to drive for his team. In the second entry, Tim Schenken was hired instead of Rolf Stommelen, who moved to Surtees. Schenken had previously driven for Frank Williams&#x27; team, but they attracted Henri Pescarolo from Matra. Williams also switched from a De Tomaso chassis to a March.

====Mid-season changes====
* Andrea de Adamich shared the drive of the March-Alfa Romeo with fellow Italian Nanni Galli. Galli also took the place of Àlex Soler-Roig when the Spaniard quit the team. At the Austrian Grand Prix, future champion Niki Lauda made his debut.
* Lotus experimented with a four-wheel drive gas turbine-powered car, the 56B. Although the engine did not deliver concrete success, the excellent chassis and wedge-shaped bodywork would serve as an inspiration to multiple championship winning teams in the years to come.
* On 11 July, Pedro Rodríguez was killed at the Norisring in Nuremberg, West Germany, driving a Ferrari 512 M in an Interserie sports car race. He was fourth in the Formula One championship at the time.
* Ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, Peter Gethin moved from McLaren to BRM. His seat was filled by Jackie Oliver and then Mark Donohue. It seemed a successful move for Gethin as, just a month later, he won the Italian Grand Prix with the highest average speed in Formula One history. It would, however, turn out to be his only podium finish and, ironically, he would never even lead a lap, having jumped from fourth to first in the final lap of that race at Monza.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from Jarama to Montjuïc, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone and the Canadian Grand Prix was moved from Mont-Tremblant to Mosport Park.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Charade Circuit to the newly built Paul Ricard Circuit.
* The German Grand Prix returned to the Nürburgring for 1971 after major safety changes had been made to the circuit. It had been moved to the Hockenheimring in 1970 after drivers refused to race at the Nürburgring in the condition it was in.

====Cancelled rounds====
* The Argentine Grand Prix was probably listed in error on the provisional calendar scheduled for 24 January. However the Autódromo Oscar y Juan Gálvez circuit had to prove itself with a non-F1 event first after a ten year-absence.
* The Belgian Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 6 June, but was cancelled because of the failure of the track owners and authorities to bring Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps up to mandatory safety standards meant that the rural circuit was deemed unsuitable for Formula One cars to race on.
* The Mexican Grand Prix was originally scheduled for 24 October but was cancelled in August due to organisational problems and lack of interest due to the recent death of the Mexican driver Pedro Rodríguez. Further there were major crowd safety concerns that arose from the 1970 Mexican Grand Prix.

==Regulation changes==

===Sporting regulations===
The maximum race distance for World Championship Grand Prix races was reduced from to .

===Safety regulations===
It was mandated that a driver should be able to evacuate himself or be evacuated from his cockpit within 5 seconds.

== Season summary ==
===Pre-season report===
Austrian Jochen Rindt had won the championship posthumously in 1970 for Lotus-Ford; he was killed at Monza during practice for the Italian Grand Prix in September of that year. Although three races remained after Monza, Rindt&#x27;s points lead after four consecutive Grand Prix victories earlier in the season was enough to secure him the championship. Briton Jackie Stewart, world champion in 1969, had a transitional year in 1970, using a customer March car after Matra refused to allow Stewart&#x27;s boss Ken Tyrrell to put a Ford-Cosworth DFV V8 in their car in place of Matra&#x27;s own V12. Tyrrell was designing his own car in secret in England, and the March was an interim solution. The new Tyrrell 001 car was first raced by the Scottish Stewart at the Mont-Tremblant circuit in Quebec, Canada- and was immediately competitive, but he retired due to mechanical failure. The car&#x27;s competitiveness enabled designer Derek Gardner to produce an even more competitive car for the 1971 season- the Tyrrell 002 and 003. 002 had a longer wheelbase and was exclusively for Stewart&#x27;s tall French teammate Francois Cevert, and 003 was exclusively for the short Stewart. These 2 cars were mechanically almost identical; the only difference being the longer wheelbase for Cevert&#x27;s height.

Over the winter months Ferrari technical director Mauro Forghieri and his engineers at Ferrari developed the car into 312B/2 form. Jacky Ickx and Clay Regazzoni were retained but the team&#x27;s third driver, Italian Ignazio Giunti was killed in January during the Buenos Aires 1000 kilometer long-distance sportscar race. Jean-Pierre Beltoise was pushing his Matra sportscar back to the pits when he was hit by Giunti&#x27;s Ferrari 312P; the Italian was killed in the ensuing crash. As a result, Mario Andretti was hired on a part-time basis to be the team&#x27;s third driver; Andretti had been driving Ferraris in long distance sportscar races during the two previous years. Tyrrell retained Jackie Stewart and Francois Cevert, while Team Lotus also developed its 1970 car for Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi and Swede Reine Wisell (although design work was progressing on the Lotus 56, a gas turbine car powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines). March lost both of its 1970 drivers: Chris Amon, moving to Matra to join Beltoise and Jo Siffert replacing Jack Oliver at BRM as teammate to Pedro Rodriguez and new driver Howden Ganley. McLaren continued with Denny Hulme and Peter Gethin but the Alfa Romeo engines used by Andrea de Adamich moved to March where the Italian became Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s teammate in the curious March 711 factory cars. Rob Walker decided that he could no longer afford to continue his private team and transferred his Brooke Bond Oxo sponsorship to Surtees, which recruited second driver Rolf Stommelen (with backing from Auto Motor und Sport and Eifelland caravans) from Brabham.

Walker&#x27;s decision to stop racing freed veteran Graham Hill and he moved to Brabham (which was now being run by Ron Tauranac, and would be bought by Bernie Ecclestone that year) where he was joined by former Williams driver Tim Schenken while Williams entered old Marches for Derek Bell and Matra refugee Henri Pescarolo.

The first Argentine Grand Prix since 1960 was held as a non-championship Grand Prix in the sweltering heat of a January summer in the capital city of Buenos Aires; the reason for this was that the FIA stipulated that in order for a country to host an official championship Grand Prix round, the organizers had to prove themselves by successfully running an interim non-championship race to their standards. This race was held at the slightly modified Buenos Aires Autodrome, the same venue used previously. Run in two heats, it was won by New Zealander Chris Amon in a Matra.

===Round 1: South Africa===
The South African Grand Prix, held at the fast and flowing high-altitude Kyalami circuit between Johannesburg and Pretoria in March kicked off the championship season. Stewart took pole, ahead of the twelve-cylinder cars of Amon, Regazzoni and Andretti. At the start, Regazzoni took the lead going into the Crowthorne corner ahead of Fittipaldi, Ickx (who had started 8th), Hulme, Rodriguez, Andretti, and Stewart. Amon dropped to 14th. Hulme in his McLaren-Ford passed Fittipaldi for second then Regazzoni for the lead. Hulme led the race until the 76th of 79 laps- when he had to come into the pits to repair some suspension damage his car had suffered. Andretti took the lead and won, followed by Stewart, Regazzoni, Wisell, Amon, and Hulme.

===7-week gap between Rounds 1 and 2===
There were three non-championship events between the first and second 1971 Formula One championship rounds. Two weeks after the South African Grand Prix, a number of teams traveled to England (where most F1 teams were and are based) to compete in the Race of Champions, held at the undulating and bumpy Brands Hatch circuit just outside London. This race, run at a shorter distance than is usual for a Grand Prix was won by the Swiss Regazzoni in a Ferrari, ahead of pole-sitter Jackie Stewart and veteran Briton John Surtees.

The Questor Grand Prix in the western United States was held one week after the Race of Champions, at the Ontario Motor Speedway in southern California. The circuit was based on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, but also had an interior road circuit which also utilized part of the speedway oval. This race, like the Argentine race, was run in two heats; Mario Andretti won in a Ferrari ahead of Jackie Stewart. Financial problems for the organizers meant that Ontario was never to be used again for a Formula One race; the circuit fell into financial disrepair and was closed in 1980. The Auto Club Speedway of California in nearby Fontana effectively replaced this venue in 1996.

Another race in England, the Spring Trophy, was held at Oulton Park near Manchester. This event was not entered by Ferrari, and Stewart took pole again ahead of Briton Peter Gethin in a McLaren-Ford, Rodriguez and Siffert BRMs. In misty, damp and cold weather, Rodriguez won the event, ahead of Gethin and Stewart.

===Round 2: Spain===
The Spanish Grand Prix in 1971 was held at the Montjuic Park city street circuit in Barcelona; the previous year it had been held at the Circuito del Jarama near Madrid as part of a rotation with the Catalan circuit. The Ferraris of Ickx and Regazzoni were 1–2 on the grid respectively, followed by Amon, Stewart, Rodriguez, Beltoise, Gethin and Andretti. Six of the first eight cars had 12-cylinder engines. Stewart took second place at the start, and passed Ickx for the lead on lap 6. Amon overtook Regazzoni for third place on lap 3. Stewart began to increase his lead over Ickx while Amon ran third; Regazzoni went out on lap 13 with a fuel pump failure which promoted Rodriguez to fourth place with Andretti fifth and Denny Hulme sixth in his McLaren-Ford. In the mid-race Andretti retired with an engine problem and so Hulme moved to fifth place and Beltoise took sixth. In the closing laps Ickx closed the gap to Stewart but he was still 3.4 seconds behind at the finish, ahead of Amon.

A third non-championship race took place in England three weeks after the Spanish Grand Prix, at Silverstone. This race also included Chevrolet-powered Formula 5000 cars. Ferrari did not enter, and the race, run in two heats, was won by British veteran Graham Hill in a Brabham-Ford.

===Round 3: Monaco===
Two weeks after the non-championship International Trophy race and five weeks after the second round in Spain came the most prestigious round of the calendar, the Monaco Grand Prix, which was also the 200th World Championship Grand Prix. Qualifying was run in rainy conditions, and Stewart took pole by 1.2 seconds from Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari. The second row featured Siffert&#x27;s BRM and Amon&#x27;s Matra; then it was Rodriguez, Hulme, Beltoise, Ronnie Peterson in a March, Hill and John Surtees in a car of his own construction. Team Lotus were far down with Wisell 11th and Fittipaldi 17th. Amon had problems at the start and lost half a lap so Ickx and Stewart were left to fight for the first corner with Siffert, who managed to slip ahead of the Ferrari and take second place behind Stewart. Five-time Monaco Grand Prix winner Graham Hill made a mistake and crashed on the second lap, and his Brabham teammate Tim Schenken hit a barrier two laps later while swerving to avoid Francois Cevert&#x27;s Tyrrell-Ford when the car&#x27;s engine cut. Both men got going again but Cevert crashed two laps later when the DFV engine cut again. Stewart gradually increased his lead, while Peterson climbed up to second place in the mid-race, passing both Ickx and Siffert. Stewart was able to hold on to take victory ahead of Peterson and Ickx; Siffert later went out with an engine failure, so fourth place went to Hulme.

===4-week gap between Rounds 3 and 4===
The Belgian Grand Prix was originally supposed to be held as a championship round two weeks after the Monaco event on 6 June at the fast 8.7 mile (14.1 km) Spa-Francorchamps circuit, but the failure of the track owners and authorities to bring Spa up to mandatory safety standards meant that the rural circuit was deemed unsuitable for Formula One cars to race on and the event was cancelled. Formula One did not return to Spa until 1983, when it was re-designed and shortened in 1979.

Another non-championship round, the Rhein-Pokalrennen, was held three weeks after the Monaco Grand Prix at the very fast Hockenheim circuit in West Germany, and was won by Jacky Ickx in a Ferrari. This race was run on the same day as the final day of the 24 Hours of Le Mans sportscar race in western France.

===Round 4: Netherlands===
One week after the non-championship Hockenheim event and four weeks after Monaco was the Dutch Grand Prix, held at the very fast and dangerous Zandvoort circuit, west of Amsterdam. The bumpy circuit had few safety features. Ickx took pole, ahead of Rodriguez, Stewart, Regazzoni and Amon. The race was run in wet conditions, and at the start Mario Andretti&#x27;s Ferrari was missing because of a fuel pump problem. He did start the race but was a long way behind and retired after just a few laps.

Ickx went ahead of Rodriguez, Stewart and Amon. Siffert blew his chances with a spin. On the second lap Amon spun out and on the third lap Stewart had a rare spin and dropped to eighth place; the Goodyear-shod runners were suffering compared to the Firestone-shod cars. This left Regazzoni third and Surtees fourth ahead of Wisell. The Swede did not last long because a rear wheel worked loose and trying to solve the problem he reversed into the pitlane and was disqualified. As everyone else struggled Ickx and Rodriguez built up a big lead with Rodriguez moving ahead on the ninth lap. They ran closely for a number of laps, but towards the end Ickx pulled away to win by nearly eight seconds. Regazzoni finished third. The Dutch Grand Prix was not held in 1972 due to the outdated facilities of the circuit; it returned for 1973.

===Round 5: France===
Two weeks after the Dutch race was the French Grand Prix at the brand-new Paul Ricard circuit near Marseille in the south of France. This circuit, in stark comparison to the rudimentary facilities of Zandvoort, was one of the most modern racing circuits in the world, with a smooth surface and state-of-the-art facilities not seen before in Formula One. It also had a long 1.1 mile straight, typical of French circuits. In the two previous years, the event had held at the twisty Charade public road circuit near Clermont-Ferrand; this was a very different type of circuit to Paul Ricard. Stewart took pole ahead of Regazzoni, Ickx and Graham Hill in a Brabham. At the start Stewart went into the lead with Regazzoni chasing. Ickx was in trouble with his engine and dropped quickly back to retire while there was a battle for third place between Rodriguez and Beltoise. On the 19th lap Peterson&#x27;s Alfa Romeo engine blew up and Regazzoni spun off on the oil. Hill had a similar accident but was able to get going and pit for repairs. This left Rodriguez in second place. By then, Cevert had moved into third later the ignition in Rodriguez&#x27;s BRM failed. So Cevert found himself promoted to second place behind Stewart, giving Tyrrell a 1-2 finish. Third place went to Fittipaldi who had come through the field after starting from 17th.

===Round 6: Britain===
Two weeks after France was the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Before the race, Pedro Rodriguez had been killed in a crash while driving a Ferrari 512S sportscar at a German Interserie race at the Norisring street circuit. At the start Regazzoni and Ickx took the lead for Ferrari with Stewart third. At the tail of the field Oliver ran into the back of Graham Hill&#x27;s Brabham, putting both men out of the race. Stewart and Siffert overtook Ickx during the second lap and on lap four Stewart overtook Regazzoni at Stowe Corner. He immediately began to build up a lead. Siffert overtook Regazzoni in the course of the fifth lap. Siffert began to suffer vibration problems and was caught and repassed by Regazzoni on lap 17. On lap 37 Ickx went into the pits to retire with engine trouble and five laps later Siffert also retired with a misfire. This put Peterson up to third place with Schenken and Fittipaldi, who had dropped to 11th early on, chasing him. On Lap 48 Regazzoni retired with engine trouble. With a few laps to go, Schenken suffered transmission failure and retired, leaving third place for Fittipaldi, and a home victory for Stewart, ahead of Peterson. Everyone else was lapped.

===Round 7: Germany===
The German Grand Prix returned to an updated 14.2 mile (22.8 km) Nurburgring after a year&#x27;s absence from the track due to safety concerns. The circuit had been resurfaced and lined with Armco barrier, some of the worst bumps were taken out or smoothed over and the circuit was made less twisty, and was therefore a little faster than before. But with the layout being largely unchanged, the circuit was still dangerous. Stewart took pole ahead of Ickx, Siffert and Regazzoni. The race distance was 12 laps, compared to the 14 lap distance for the 1969 race. There was a crowd of around 375,000 for the race on Sunday. Graham Hill (Brabham) and Reine Wisell (Lotus) both had problems before the start only 20 cars lined up on the grid. Ickx took the lead from Stewart but the Tyrrell was soon back ahead again and pulling away from the rest with Ickx being chased by Regazzoni, Hulme, Siffert, Peterson and Cevert. On the second lap, while pushing hard to keep up with Stewart, Ickx spun off at the Eiskurve corner and Regazzoni went off as he tried to avoid his teammate. This left Stewart with a big lead over Siffert (who had overtaken Hulme). Regazzoni rejoined in third and Peterson (who had also overtaken Hulme) was fourth. The McLaren driver soon fell behind Andretti and Cevert, and the Tyrrell driver soon passed the Ferrari so was up to fifth. In the laps that followed, Cevert overtook Peterson, Siffert (who soon dropped behind Regazzoni) and then Regazzoni himself. Thereafter the order remained stable at the front with a Tyrrell 1-2 the result, with Stewart winning his fifth race of the season. Regazzoni was third with Andretti catching and passing Peterson for fourth.

===Round 8: Austria===
For only the third time, the Austrian Grand Prix was a championship round. The race was held at the Österreichring in the rural Styrian mountains near Graz. Jackie Stewart had a large lead in the driver&#x27;s championship - 51 points compared to second-placed Jacky Ickx&#x27;s 19 points and Ronnie Peterson&#x27;s 16 points. If Ickx and Peterson both failed to score here, Stewart would be champion. Jo Siffert took pole in his BRM, followed by Stewart, Cevert, Regazzoni, Fittipaldi and Ickx. Siffert took the lead at the start and held off Stewart&#x27;s attacks with Regazzoni, Cevert, Ickx and Schenken chasing after them. Both Ferraris retired early with engine trouble. This promoted Cevert to third place and Schenken to fourth. As the race progressed, Cevert closed on Stewart, who was struggling with the handling of his car. On lap 23 Cevert was waved through into second place. On Lap 31, Ickx had retired with problems with his Ferrari engine&#x27;s spark plugs and Peterson was running in ninth place and out of the points with serious handling problems. On Lap 36 Stewart&#x27;s race ended with a broken rear axle. Cevert&#x27;s engine failed on lap 43, promoting Fittipaldi to second, having overtaken Schenken a few laps earlier. In the final laps Siffert suffered a deflating tire but he was so far ahead that he was able to nurse the car to the line, beating Fittipaldi by just over four seconds. Peterson finished out of the points in eighth, so Stewart was World Champion for the second time. Niki Lauda made his debut in this race in a March; he qualified 21st and retired on lap 20 with handling problems.

The Gold Cup non-championship Grand Prix at Oulton Park was won by veteran John Surtees in his own Surtees car. This race was held one week after the Austrian Grand Prix. The Tyrrell team did not enter this event.

===Round 9: Italy===

A year since the death of Jochen Rindt at Monza, there were still some legal problems between Team Lotus and the Italian authorities which meant that Team Lotus did not officially enter the event, although a Lotus 56 did enter under the name World Wide Racing. This car was powered by an American Pratt &amp; Whitney turbine jet engine. McLaren was also down to just one entry as Denny Hulme was away in the United States for a USAC race in California. Matra was also running only one car as Jean-Pierre Beltoise was still suspended as a result of the sportscar accident in January in Buenos Aires which had killed Ignazio Giunti. The field was bolstered by a third Surtees, entered for Mike Hailwood, a multiple Grand Prix motorcycle champion making the transition to car racing. On the fast sweeps of Monza the V12 cars were very competitive and Chris Amon took pole in his Matra with Jacky Ickx alongside in his Ferrari. The second row featured the BRMs of Jo Siffert and Howden Ganley and the first V8 car was the Tyrrell of Francois Cevert, fifth on the grid. At the start of the race Regazzoni made a fast start from the fourth row to take the lead. On lap 16 both Stewart and Ickx retired with engine failures and two laps later Regazzoni went out as well. Eventually, a close five-car battle developed for the lead, with Peter Gethin taking his only Grand Prix victory by 0.010 secs. The first five cars were all covered by 0.61s; it was the closest finish in the history of the World Championship and the fastest ever race, with an average speed of 150.75 mph. Peterson was second with Cevert third, Hailwood fourth and Ganley fifth. Amon was sixth over half a minute behind. Chicanes were added to Monza&#x27;s layout for subsequent years, lowering average speeds and effectively eliminating the slipstream battles that highlighted previous Italian Grands Prix at Monza.

===Round 10: Canada===
Two weeks after the Italian Grand Prix, the Canadian Grand Prix was held at Mosport Park circuit near Toronto. World Champion Stewart took pole position ahead of Siffert, Cevert, Fittipaldi, Amon, Peterson, Wisell, and Mark Donohue in a Penske-entered McLaren. The Ferraris were not competitive with Ickx 12th, Andretti 13th and Regazzoni 18th. 37-year old Wayne Kelly was killed on lap 2 of a Formula Ford support race and the Grand Prix was delayed, and by the time the race started it was pouring with rain. Howden Ganley crashed his BRM in the warm-up period before the race and so could not make the start. At the start Stewart went into the lead with Peterson second, chased by Beltoise, Donohue, Fittipaldi, Cevert and the rest. On the third lap Graham Hill crashed his Brabham and five laps later Regazzoni did the same in his Ferrari, which caught fire. Stewart had a firm grip on the race while Peterson had to fight for second with Beltoise until the Frenchman crashed on lap 16. At the same time Donohue pitted for new goggles but did not lose a place. This left a large gap between the first two and the rest. Peterson took the lead on lap 18 but on lap 31 Stewart took the lead back while they were going through backmarkers. A few moments later Peterson ran into Eaton&#x27;s BRM and damaged the front of his car. This upset the balance of the car and Peterson was unable to match Stewart&#x27;s pace and so the Tyrrell edged away to win by nearly 40 seconds. It was Stewart&#x27;s sixth championship victory of the season. Donohue finished third on his F1 debut.

===Round 11: United States===
Another fortnight later, the championship moved to the newly revamped and redesigned Watkins Glen circuit in upstate New York. The circuit, originally 2.3 miles long, had been significantly upgraded, with a new pits and paddock complex and an additional mile of new track. Jackie Stewart took his sixth pole position of the year for Tyrrell, ahead of Emerson Fittipaldi, Denny Hulme, Clay Regazzoni, Francois Cevert, Jo Siffert, Jacky Ickx and Chris Amon. 29 drivers entered and started the race; Stewart took the lead from Hulme at the start with Cevert moving up to third place, followed by Regazzoni and Siffert. Fittipaldi made a poor start and was eighth. On the seventh lap Cevert was able to pass Hulme for second place and on lap 14 he moved ahead of Stewart, who was suffering from bad oversteer. Hulme was also having handling problems and he began to drop back, being overtaken by Ickx (who had passed Siffert). Stewart also fell victim to the Ferrari and then Siffert as well. Ickx stalked Cevert until lap 40 when the Ferrari began to fall back with an alternator problem which led to the Belgian&#x27;s retirement. This moved Siffert to second place and Peterson (who had passed Stewart) to take third. Howden Ganley was fourth with Stewart fifth.

It was Cevert&#x27;s first World Championship victory and with the Mexican Grand Prix having been cancelled due to crowd control problems the previous year, the United States Grand Prix was the last World Championship race of the 1971 season.

===World Championship Victory Race===
There was one more non-championship race to contend, the World Championship Victory Race at Brands Hatch, England, three weeks after the United States Grand Prix. The race lasted for less than half of its intended distance following a number of accidents. On lap 2, Henri Pescarolo and Reine Wisell collided at the Druids hairpin, with both cars retiring. Then Mike Hailwood and Ronnie Peterson also collided and had to pit for repairs. Hailwood&#x27;s car was deemed unfit to continue, but Peterson rejoined the race, albeit nearly a lap down. Siffert had fallen several places at the start, but had made his way back to 4th by lap 14. Approaching the fast Hawthorn Bend at high speed on lap 15, his BRM suffered a mechanical failure which pitched it across the track into an earth bank. The car rolled over and caught fire, trapping him underneath, and he died from asphyxiation before he could be extricated. The race was stopped with the track blocked, and all the cars were stranded out on the circuit except for John Surtees, who was able to drive around to the pits, his car damaged by debris.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. For both the Championship and the Cup, the best five results from rounds 1-6 and the best four results from rounds 7-11 were counted.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

===International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings===



*Bold results counted towards final points totals.

==Non-championship races==
A number of other Formula One races, which did not count towards the World Championship, were also held in 1971. The Questor Grand Prix and the last three British races were open to both Formula One and Formula 5000 cars.

<doc id="1140091" wikidata="Q47225" url="?curid=1140091" title="1970 Formula One season">
<text>The 1970 Formula One season was the 24th season of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s Formula One motor racing. It featured the 21st World Championship of Drivers, the 13th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and three non-championship races open to Formula One cars. The World Championship was contested over thirteen races between 7 March and 25 October.

Jochen Rindt, driving for Lotus, won his first Drivers&#x27; Championship, although he died four races before the end of the season. He had earned enough championship points that no other driver managed to surpass his total. It is the only season to date in which the Drivers&#x27; Championship has been awarded posthumously. Jacky Ickx, driving for Ferrari, finished the season strongly but ended up five points short. The Manufacturers&#x27; Cup was won by Lotus, seven points ahead of Ferrari.

Bruce McLaren, founder and owner of the famous McLaren team, died on 2 June while testing his McLaren M8D Can-Am car at Goodwood Circuit. Piers Courage, driver for Frank Williams&#x27;s team, was killed during the Dutch Grand Prix on 21 June.

Three-time World Champion Jack Brabham retired at the end of the year.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1970 World Championship.

===Team and driver changes===
* Matra had split with Ken Tyrrell and entered the season under French licence. The MS120 was powered by Matra&#x27;s own V12 engine. Tyrrell entered two Cosworth-provided March 701&#x27;s, before introducing the Tyrrell 001 later in the year, the first chassis designed by the Tyrrell team. Reigning champion Jackie Stewart and his teammate Johnny Servoz-Gavin both moved to Tyrrell, while their third teammate Jean-Pierre Beltoise stayed with Matra. He was joined by Henri Pescarolo, for his first full-time drive.
* champion Graham Hill was moved out of Team Lotus by team boss Colin Chapman and placed at the Rob Walker Racing Team. Walker&#x27;s 1969 driver Jo Siffert found a new home at March. There he was joined by Chris Amon, who had left Ferrari half-way through last season, disappointed by the performance of their engine.
* 1969 runner-up Jacky Ickx returned to Ferrari, having spent one year at Brabham. Ferrari&#x27;s switch from a V12 to a flat-12 engine gave the Belgian hopes of new success. His place at Brabham was taken up by debutant Rolf Stommelen. Ex-Ferrari driver Pedro Rodríguez was signed by BRM.
* champion John Surtees had driven for BRM in 1969, but left to set up his own team. He entered and drove a McLaren M7C before debuting his self-designed Surtees TS7 half-way through the year.
* Andrea de Adamich, sports car driver for Alfa Romeo, was signed by McLaren to drive a third car powered by an Alfa Romeo V8.
* Frank Williams had run a privatised Brabham BT26C in 1969, but collaborated with Italian car manufacturer De Tomaso. This resulted in the De Tomaso 505/38, which was uncompetitive and never managed to be classified in a championship race.

====Mid-season changes====
* Tyrrell driver Johnny Servoz-Gavin retired from the sport three races into the 1970 season. His seat was taken up by François Cevert.
* After the death of Bruce McLaren, new team leader Teddy Mayer signed American driver Peter Gethin. Veteran Dan Gurney also drove three races for the McLaren team.
* Ferrari expanded their operations from one to three cars, promoting their successful sports car driver Ignazio Giunti and hiring Clay Regazzoni. The Swiss would also continue to drive in Formula Two and would go on to win the F2 championship.
* Piers Courage was killed in the Dutch Grand Prix. Frank Williams hired Brian Redman and then Tim Schenken.
* John Miles quit the sport after Jochen Rindt&#x27;s accident. Besides everything, this left Lotus team owner Colin Chapman without drivers. He hired Emerson Fittipaldi, at the time a promising F2 driver, and Reine Wisell, another debutant but with wide experience under his belt.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The Belgian Grand Prix returned after major safety changes had been made to Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Drivers had boycotted the race because of the extreme dangers.
* After a one-off Austrian Grand Prix in , the event returned to the calendar and was held at the newly built Österreichring.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from Montjuïc to Jarama, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Silverstone to Brands Hatch and the Canadian Grand Prix was moved from Mosport Park to Circuit Mont-Tremblant.
* The German Grand Prix was originally to be held at the Nürburgring but the drivers refused to race unless major safety changes were made to it. The circuit&#x27;s owners responded negatively to a list of changes requested by the drivers, so the Hockenheimring was found as host for the race in 1970.

==Regulation changes==

===Technical regulations===
* A &quot;safety bladder&quot; was introduced around the fuel tanks to reduce the risk of fires.
* The maximum displacement for compressed engines, turbo engines for example, was reduced from to . The maximum displacement for naturally aspirated engines remained at .
* The minimum weight was raised from to .

===Sporting and event regulations===
The starting order of the race would usually be decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest time during any of the practice sessions. However, in some cases, only ten &quot;chosen&quot; drivers would be guaranteed a place on the grid, in the order of their best time. The remaining drivers had to earn their entry in a 30-minute qualifying session: the fastest drivers in that session would be allowed to start the race and would be placed on the grid in the order of their original best practice time. This resulted in drivers not qualifying for a race despite going faster in practice than others who did qualify. This system was introduced shortly before the second race of the season, leading to protests among teams and drivers.

Drivers would have to complete at least five laps in practice to be allowed to race. 

The FIA published some considerations on circuit design and announced that all circuits would have to pass their inspections:
* Run-off areas should be at least wide.
* Double guardrails were now the standard. The use of strawbales was banned.
* Spectators placed at least behind the fencing.
* The pit lane should be separated from the track by a barrier.
* Furthermore, regulations were set on track width, track surface and maximum gradient change.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 5===
As it had been since , the championship commenced in South Africa. Reigning champion Jackie Stewart, driving a privatised March 701 for Tyrrell Racing, set the fastest lap, before Chris Amon, driving the same car but for the March works team, set the exact same time, a 1:19.3. Three-time World Champion Jack Brabham joined them on the first row. At the start, Stewart and Brabham had the best initial start, until Jochen Rindt, who started in fourth, made a charge round the outside of the first corner. But he hit the front of Amon&#x27;s car and then crashed into Brabham. Stewart was the only frontrunner unharmed and was now leading Jacky Ickx and Jackie Oliver, who started fifth and twelfth, respectively. By lap 6, however, Brabham was back into second place, and the McLarens of Denny Hulme and Bruce McLaren were third and fourth. Brabham took the lead on lap 20, Hulme went past Stewart on lap 38 into second, and it was only thanks to Bruce McLaren&#x27;s engine failure that the Scot finished on the podium.

During the weekend of the Spanish Grand Prix, the organisers of the event, backed by the Commission Sportive Internationale (currently known as the FIA), had a falling out with a large number of teams and drivers, represented by the F1CA (later known as FOCA). The organisers had suddenly decided to allow just 16 starters for the race, and, only after all practice and qualifying sessions were run, decided to discount any lap time set on Friday. Under pressure of the protesting teams, they reverted their decision on the morning of the race and all 22 entered cars were rolled onto the grid, until the CSI forced them to uphold it and saw to it that the six slowest qualifiers, based on the Saturday qualifying times alone, were removed. The first row on the grid was filled by Jack Brabham (Brabham), Denny Hulme (McLaren) and Jackie Stewart (March). At the start, Jacky Ickx and Jackie Oliver came together and both cars were engulfed in flames. Another nine drivers retired during the race with mechanical issues, which meant only five were left at the finish. Stewart won ahead of Bruce McLaren and Mario Andretti, the American&#x27;s first podium. Stewart&#x27;s victory would be the last for any &quot;private&quot; (non-works) team.

In Monaco, the same qualifying rules were implemented, resulting in six cars not qualifying for the race, although none of them were slowest in practice. Championship leader Stewart started on pole position, with Amon next to him. Hulme and Brabham started on the second row. Bruce McLaren retired on lap 19, when he hit the wall going through the fast chicane after the tunnel. On lap 22, Brabham finally managed to pass Amon, and when Stewart&#x27;s Cosworth engine started misfiring badly, he acquired the lead of the race. With three quarters of the race, Amon crashed out with a broken rear suspension and Hulme fell back with gearbox issues. This gave Jochen Rindt a surprising chance for a podium finish and the inspired Austrian actually came within a few car lengths of Brabham. On the last corner of the last lap, the Australian took a different line than usual to prevent any chance of an overtake, but he locked his wheels and slid straight on into the barrier. Rindt swooped by, setting a new lap record and taking the victory for the second time in his career. Brabham dragged his damaged car over the line, ahead of Henri Pescarolo in the Matra, scoring his first podium.

After the death of founder and owner Bruce McLaren, the McLaren team withdrew their cars for the Belgian Grand Prix. The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps had received an upgrade in safety measures: Armco barriers lined around the track and a slow chicane instead of the infamous high-speed Masta kink. Unlike in the last two races, practice times were used to determine the order of the grid and it was Stewart again on pole, with Rindt and Amon next to him. Rindt was first at the start, but it was Stewart and Amon fighting for the lead during the opening laps. Pedro Rodríguez started sixth but had passed everyone in front of him by lap 5, the BRM V12 engine reaching nearly on the straights, but Amon kept the pressure on him, setting a new lap record, even with the added chicane. Half-way through the race, Stewart&#x27;s engine let go, before Hill and Brabham suffered mechanical issues as well. Rodríguez his second career win, just over a second clear of Amon. Jean-Pierre Beltoise finished third, and with two other V12-powered cars in the points, the Belgian high-speed roads had brought a stop to the V8 monopoly.

Lotus introduced their wedge-shaped Lotus 72 for the Dutch Grand Prix, incorporating revolutionary brake and suspension design. It provided better vision and ventilation to the driver besides the overall advancement in grip and ride. Rindt comfortably qualified on pole position, with Stewart and Ickx next to him. The Belgian driver forced his Ferrari into the lead ahead of Rindt, while Stewart fell to fourth. Going into lap 3, however, Rindt passed Ickx with ease, going round the outside at Tarzan corner. The Austrian would finish 30 seconds ahead of Stewart and a lap ahead of Ickx in third place. The race was marred by the fatal accident of Piers Courage.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jackie Stewart led with 19 points, ahead of Jochen Rindt with 18 and Jack Brabham with 15. Their respective constructors filled the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup standings in the same order: March led with 25 points, ahead of Lotus with 23 and Brabham with 17.

===Rounds 6 to 9===
Jochen Rindt in his new Lotus 72 was favourite for the French Grand Prix, but he was suffering from a stomach ulcer and the twisty nature of the track brought on heavy sickness. To add to the misery, in practice, a stone was thrown up by a car in front, hitting his face and cutting his right cheek deeply. After qualifying, it seemed that, like in Spa, the V12-powered cars would be dominant: Jacky Ickx put his Ferrari on pole position, ahead of Jean-Pierre Beltoise in the Matra. And in the opening laps, only championship leader Jackie Stewart was able to keep up with those two. On lap 16, however, Ickx&#x27;s engine was misfiring and he had to retire. When Stewart pitted with engine issues as well, Rindt was in second place and promptly set a new fastest lap. When Beltoise suffered a slow rear puncture, hopes of an all-French win in France were shattered and Rindt took the win, ahead of Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, and took the lead in the Drivers&#x27; standings.

For the British Grand Prix, Rindt was again favourite, but his Firestone tyres were not working perfectly in the high summer temperatures. Brabham, using Goodyear tyres, managed to equal Rindt&#x27;s time in practice. Ickx completed the front row. Stewart started down in eighth, his March not liking the bumpy off-camber track of Brands Hatch. At the start, Brabham took the lead but was quickly passed by Ickx. The Ferrari was quick until its differential broke on lap 7. Ickx slowed down, Brabham&#x27;s entry to Paddock Bend was hampered and Rindt seized the chance to pass them both. Rindt and Brabham were inseparable for the next 60 laps, until the Austrian missed a gear and the Australian outbraked him into South Bank corner. Brabham led away, growing his advantage to 13 seconds in the last lap, but then dramatically running out of fuel. Rindt crossed the line first, extending his lead in the championship, and Brabham coasted home in second. Denny Hulme was third for McLaren. After the race, Rindt was disqualified for running an illegally high rear wing, but team boss Colin Chapman successfully appealed and the decision was reverted.

The German Grand Prix was planned to be held at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, but in light of the deaths of Bruce McLaren and Piers Courage, the drivers asked the FIA to find a safer circuit. This led to the first Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring, which had already been fitted with Armco barriers all around. The track&#x27;s whose long straights gave the advantage to the V12-powered cars, whereas the Cosworth V8s suffered from attrition. Jacky Ickx started on pole in his Ferrari, with championship leader Jochen Rindt and teammate Clay Regazzoni next to him. Rindt&#x27;s main rival Jack Brabham could only manage a twelfth starting position and when his engine suffered an oil leak, he was already out of the race after four laps. Ickx and Rindt engaged in a race-long battle, the Austrian eventually taking his fourth win in a row. Denny Hulme was third, again, while Jackie Stewart retired with engine troubles before the half-way point.

Ferrari&#x27;s hopes for a resurgence came true during the Austrian Grand Prix. The first race at the new Österreichring saw Jochen Rindt take pole position, but he was closely followed by both Regazzoni and Ickx. Ignazio Giunti in the third Ferrari started fifth. Brabham had another miserable qualifying: he started in eighth. Rindt lost out at the start, dropping to third, and Ickx was waved through by his teammate in a tactical play. François Cevert&#x27;s Tyrrell lost oil and in the melee, Rindt dropped to seventh place. He tried to fight back, but on lap 21, his Cosworth engine broke and all danger to Ferrari was over. The pair in red finished the race in formation and lapped the whole field except third-placed Rolf Stommelen.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jochen Rindt&#x27;s retirement had not made a big dent in his lead, yet. He stood on 45 points, ahead of Jack Brabham with 25 and Denny Hulme with 20. In the battle for the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup, Lotus, unsurprisingly, was in the lead with 50 points, ahead of March and Brabham with 33.

===Rounds 10 to 13===
With the Scuderia Ferrari coming off a dominant victory in Austria, the tifosi were praying for a repeat during the Italian Grand Prix. Main rivals March and Lotus had prepared their cars for the long straights of Monza by stripping them from any spoilers and such. It allowed them to reach top speeds of over but made them quite unstable in the corners, which Emerson Fittipaldi found out during practice: he crashed going into the Parabolica, escaped unhurt, but gave his Lotus mechanics a big repair job. Championship leader Jochen Rindt crashed at the same place on Saturday and the Austrian came off much worse, sadly: he was only wearing a seat belt around his waist and, in the impact, slid underneath it, all the way down until the belt slit his throat. Upon hearing the news, the Lotus team packed up their operations and withdrew from the race. With the wreck cleared, normal proceedings resumed, albeit in a very different atmosphere. Jacky Ickx qualified on pole position for Ferrari, ahead of Pedro Rodríguez (British Racing Motors|BRM), Clay Regazzoni (Ferrari) and Jackie Stewart (Tyrrell-March). Ickx fell back to seventh place, but the other three put up a brilliant fight for the lead, switching positions almost every lap. Rodríguez retired when his engine exploded, but his teammate Jackie Oliver joined the battle. Spurred on by the promise that a part of the prize money would be awarded to the driver in the lead at laps 17, 34 and 51, several drivers joined the tactical slipstreaming fight. In the end, Regazzoni managed to win the race, ahead of a group of four drivers finishing within three quarters of a second. Jackie Stewart and Jean-Pierre Beltoise completed the podium. François Cevert, the only other driver to not get lapped, encountered a sea of fans on the track when he finished a minute later.

The championship concluded with three races in North America, starting with the Canadian Grand Prix at the spectacular Circuit Mont-Tremblant. The Lotus team had decided not to participate, while Tyrrell revealed their first self-designed chassis: the 001. Jackie Stewart immediately snatched pole position, going four tenths faster than in his March, ahead of the Ferrari pair of Ickx and Regazzoni. In the race, Stewart established a comfortable lead, until on lap 32, his left front suspension collapsed and he retired. Ickx and Regazzoni moved up to take a 1-2 finish, ahead of Chris Amon in the March.

For the United States Grand Prix, Ickx qualified on pole position, ahead of Stewart and Fittipaldi, the leading Lotus driver after Rindt&#x27;s demise. Ickx needed to win the two remaining races to stand a chance of overtaking Rindt&#x27;s points total, but at the start, he fell back to third. On lap 16, he overtook Rodríguez for second, but around half distance, had to make a pit stop to repair a fuel leak. Stewart then retired with an oil leak, and Rodríguez had to pit for extra fuel. This left the Lotus pair of Fittipaldi and Wisell in the lead. Rodríguez eventually recovered to second, while Ickx could manage more than fourth place. Jochen Rindt was awarded the Drivers&#x27; Championship posthumously.

For the Mexican Grand Prix, Clay Regazzoni qualified on pole, ahead of the three &quot;Jacks&quot;: Stewart, Ickx and Brabham. The race was delayed over an hour, because over 200,000 supporters had turned up and were lined up right along the track to get the best view. The drivers pleaded with the crowd to move back and eventually agreed to start the race. When they got underway, Ickx quickly seized the lead. Stewart had to pit due to a loose steering column but he was fighting back to the front until, on lap 33, he hit a stray dog and heavily damaged his front suspension. Ferrari scored their third 1-2 finish, ahead of Denny Hulme in the McLaren.

Jochen Rindt was awarded the Drivers&#x27; Championship posthumously, the only time this has ever happened, with 45 points, ahead of the Ferrari drivers Jacky Ickx (40) and Clay Regazzoni (33). Lotus were awarded the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup with 59 points, ahead of Ferrari (52) and March (48).

==Results and standings==

<text>The 1969 Formula One season was the 23rd season of the FIA&#x27;s Formula One motor racing. It featured the 20th World Championship of Drivers, the 12th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers and four non-championship races open to Formula One cars. The World Championship was contested over eleven races between 1 March and 19 October 1969.

British driver Jackie Stewart, driving a Matra-Ford Cosworth, won more than half of the races and claimed his first Drivers&#x27; Championship. The Matra works team did not compete in this season, but the privateer Matra International team, led by Ken Tyrrell, helped Matra win the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup. Both titles were the first titles won by a French constructor, and still remain the only titles won by a car built in France as well as a car entered by a privateer team.

==Teams and drivers==
The following teams and drivers competed in the 1969 World Championship.

* Pink background denotes F2 entrants to the German Grand Prix.

===Team and driver changes===
* Matra did not operate a works team this year, instead focusing on their collaboration with Ken Tyrrell. The Tyrrell team (entered under &quot;Matra International&quot;) kept Jackie Stewart but replaced Johnny Servoz-Gavin with works driver Jean-Pierre Beltoise.
* Brabham switched from Repco engines to Ford-Cosworth DFVs, when the Australian company withdrew their support.
* Lotus signed Austrian driver Jochen Rindt instead of Jackie Oliver. The Brit found a new home at BRM. There, John Surtees completed a new driver duo. He had driven for Honda, but the manufacturer had withdrawn from the sport.
* The same was true for Cooper and Eagle. Both manufacturers were seen back just once in the 1969 season, being driven by privateer teams.
* Jacky Ickx moved to Brabham to take Rindt&#x27;s place and his old team, Scuderia Ferrari, reduced their operations to one car for Chris Amon.
* This season marked the debut of legendary team owner Frank Williams. He bought a Brabham BT26A and promoted his Formula Two driver Piers Courage.

====Mid-season changes====
Going into the second half of the season, Chris Amon left Ferrari. The Italian team signed Mexican driver Pedro Rodríguez from BRM.

==Calendar==
===Calendar changes===
* The South African Grand Prix remained the season opener, but was moved back from January to March.
* The Spanish Grand Prix was moved from Jarama to Montjuïc, in keeping with the event-sharing arrangement between the two circuits. Likewise, the British Grand Prix was moved from Brands Hatch to Silverstone and the Canadian Grand Prix was moved from Mont-Tremblant to Mosport Park.
* The French Grand Prix was moved from Rouen-Les-Essarts to Charade Circuit due to safety concerns that were made apparent by Jo Schlesser&#x27;s fatal accident in the 1968 French Grand Prix.
* After the 1968 Mexican Grand Prix had been held in November to avoid a clash with the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, the Mexican Grand Prix was back at its usual date in October.

====Cancelled rounds====
The Belgian Grand Prix was originally to be held on 8 June, but Jackie Stewart, a strong advocate for safety in Formula One, had inspected the track and demanded multiple changes to the circuit. The track owners did not grant his wishes and the drivers boycotted the Grand Prix.

==Regulation changes==
 Aerodynamics had been the talk of the town since last season and most teams chose to implement front and rear wings, besides the front nose spoilers which had been around a little longer. Lotus had pioneered movable wings, operated by a fourth pedal at the driver&#x27;s feet, and their rivals had used the winter stop to implement a system of their own. McLaren, for example, gave their drivers a lever next to their left hand to flatten the rear wing, giving more speed on the straight, and connected the brake pedal to the wing to automatically put the wing back to its original position and add downforce for the corner. Tyrrell Matra came up with an electrically operated rear wing, automatically flattening the rear wing when fifth gear was selected.

At the beginning of the season, the wings were positioned as high as possible to generate the most downforce and secured on the car&#x27;s suspension to push the tyres into the ground. But when the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix featured several dramatic crashes, the FIA (then known as the &quot;Commission Sportive Internationale&quot; or &quot;CSI&quot;) banned all use of wings. Only the aerofoils on the nose were still allowed. This was suddenly decided after the first practice session of the Monaco Grand Prix.

From the next race on, wings would be allowed again, but only if there no movable parts, if they were rigidly attached to sprung parts of the bodywork (so not to the suspension) and fell within a certain maximum height and width. These rules were introduced for the Dutch Grand Prix and strictly enforced from the French Grand Prix on.

==Championship report==
===Rounds 1 to 4===

During practice for the South African Grand Prix, reigning champion Graham Hill broke the pedal operating the wings, while the wings themselves broke on the cars of his Lotus teammates Jochen Rindt and Mario Andretti. The American driver had noticed that, when going through a fast corner, the wing leant sideways so far that it touched the rear tyre and twisted the struts. Three-time World Champion Jack Brabham qualified on pole position in the car bearing his name, ahead of Rindt and champion Denny Hulme. With Matra driver Jackie Stewart and Ferrari driver Chris Amon starting behind them, five different teams occupied the first two rows. At the start, Stewart got up to second behind Brabham, overtook the Australian before the end of the first lap, and then broke the lap record while still heavy on fuel. Brabham&#x27;s rear wing collapsed on lap 5 and had both wings cut off in the pits. This allowed him to reach on the straight but made the car very unstable in the corners, and he decided to retire. Andretti inherited second place, but then retired with a gearbox failure, and Rindt suffered from a failing fuel pump. Stewart took an unchallenged victory, ahead of Hill and Hulme.

For the first time, the Spanish Grand Prix was run at Montjuïc circuit (although the street circuit had existed since 1933). During practice, Rindt hit a stray dog and damaged his suspension but still managed to qualify on pole, ahead of Amon and Hill. Stewart and Brabham qualified on the second row. Only twelve drivers managed to start the race and Hill crashed out after just six laps, but Rindt led away without trouble. On lap 20, however, his rear wing collapsed while travelling and he crashed into the Armco barrier. He hit the wreckage of Hill&#x27;s car and then overturned. He was taken into hospital and would miss the next race. Amon inherited the lead with almost 40 seconds over Stewart, until his engine blew on lap 56. While Jacky Ickx was in second place, his wing collapsed, necessating a pit stop, and later, his Brabham&#x27;s rear wishbone broke, making retirement unavoidable. Once again, Stewart was unchallenged, two full laps ahead of Bruce McLaren and teammate Jean-Pierre Beltoise.

Going into the Monaco Grand Prix, one could have expected unified actions to control the high and fragile wings, but it took the &quot;CSI&quot; (FIA) until after the first practice was already run. In the meantime, Matra had added even more aerodynamic pieces to their cars&#x27; noses and Ferrari had implemented an hydraulically-controlled wing. Stewart set a lap time that looked unbeatable, but when all aerofoils and wings were banned, the FIA also scrapped all times from Thursday practice. After this reset, Stewart was again fastest and qualified on pole, ahead of Ferrari driver Amon and Matra teammate Beltoise, but all three of them retired within six laps of each other. With Brabham and Ickx failing to finish as well, Hill took an easy win, a record fifth victory in Monaco, ahead of Piers Courage, driving a Brabham for Frank Williams Racing Cars, and Jo Siffert, driving a Lotus for Rob Walker Racing Team.
The ban on movable wings was still active during the Dutch Grand Prix, but the &quot;CSI&quot; now allowed aerodynamic devices if they were fixed to the bodywork (and not to the suspension) and could not move. With the regulations formulated quite loosely, though, teams provoked the Dutch scrutineers with some daring designs, only some of which were banned. Furthermore, Matra and Lotus introduced four-wheel drive cars, but only tried them out in practice. Rindt qualified on pole, with Stewart and Hill next to him, and it was the reigning champion that reached the end of the straight first. With Stewart regelated back to third, Lotus could control the race, but instead, started fighting each other, with Rindt taking the lead on lap 3, while going off track with two wheels. The Austrian then pulled out a ten-second lead, leaving Hill vulnerable to Stewart&#x27;s offense. The Scot moved up to second place, but in terms of pace was losing out, until Rindt suffered a drive shaft failure on lap 16. With the Matra let loose and free to take the win, eyes turned to the battle behind him. Siffert clinched second place with a daring move round the outside of Tarzan corner, and after Hill had to make an unforeseen pit stop, it was Amon that scored a third place for Ferrari.

In the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Jackie Stewart (Matra) was leading with 27 points, ahead of Graham Hill (Lotus) with 15 and Jo Siffert (Lotus) with 13. For the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup, Matra was leading the standings with 27 points, ahead of Lotus (21) and McLaren (15).

===Rounds 5 to 8===

With the rules on aerodynamic devices now formalised, the French Grand Prix would likely show who the favourites would be for the title. And first of all, it was Jackie Stewart claiming pole position for Matra, ahead of champion Denny Hulme for McLaren and Jochen Rindt for Lotus. Reigning champion Graham Hill started down in eighth, out of just thirteen entrants. The Lotus 63 was prepared for their Formula Three driver John Miles, giving him the honour to make the first ever start in a four-wheel drive Formula One car. He did retire with a broken fuel pump, however, on the first lap. Stewart, meanwhile, took an easy win, with his teammate and home hero Jean-Pierre Beltoise finishing in second, and Belgian driver Jacky Ickx completing the podium in his Brabham.

During practice for the British Grand Prix, it was again Stewart who set the pace from the beginning, and he was comfortable to switch to the four-wheel drive Matra MS84. McLaren launched their four-wheel drive car, the M9A-1, while Lotus came prepared with two four-wheel drive cars, having convinced Hill to give it a try. But it was Rindt in the two-wheel drive Lotus 49B that gave Stewart a real run for his money: the Austrian came within two tenths of a second of the Scot, who felt another defensive lap was necessary. Going through the last corner, however, he hit a loose kerb and crashed backwards into the wall. Regulations at the time stated that positions on the starting grid were decided by the fastest time set in the car that actually started the race. Given that the Matra was irreparable in the time available and Stewart had to take over his teammate&#x27;s car, the stewards took Stewart&#x27;s fastest time in that car and placed him second on the grid. At the start, Rindt managed to just stay ahead and the two rivals sailed away into the distance. Sixth-starting John Surtees got up to third, but his suspension collapsed before the first lap was completed, giving the place to Hulme. Stewart took the lead on lap 6 but had to hand it back on lap 16, when the pair came across Beltoise, trying to find his feet in the MS84. Hulme retired with a faulty ignition, giving way to Bruce McLaren, who was then passed by Jacky Ickx. On lap 62, Rindt&#x27;s rear wing collapsed and he had to pit. This handed Stewart his fifth win in six races, ahead of Ickx and McLaren. Rindt came home in fourth.
For the German Grand Prix, twelve Formula Two cars complemented the grid, and one of them, Gerhard Mitter, was sadly killed during practice. On the F1 grid, it was Ickx who set his first pole position of the year, ahead of Stewart and Rindt, and the Belgian made a good start. Mario Andretti, coming over from the United States to further develop the four-wheel drive Lotus, slowed down during the first lap and saw Vic Elford crashing into him and flying into the trees. The McLaren driver broke his arm in three places. Meanwhile, Ickx fell back to fourth place, but he made an inspired recovery to second place. He closed up and the leading pair went nose-to-tail for two full laps. Ickx made a heroic pass under braking, but locked up, and Stewart held on. On lap 6, the Brabham took the lead firmly and quickly set a lap record. He eventually took the win with a minute advantage over the championship leader. Bruce McLaren and Graham Hill finished third and fourth, respectively.

Ickx had climbed up to second place in the standings, but was looking at such a distance to Stewart, that the championship would be decided at the Italian Grand Prix if the Scot managed to win the race. During qualifying, he did not manage more than third, behind Rindt and Hulme, but overtook the New Zealander at the start and the Austrian later in the first lap. Ickx had to pit when his oil pressure dropped. The three at the front traded places a couple of times, with a group of five drivers behind them joining in the slipstream battle. Hill had started in ninth but was charging Stewart for the lead near the end of the race, until his drive shaft broke with four laps to go. After at least fourteen lead changes and even a lot more in the remaining points-paying positions, it was Stewart&#x27;s teammate Beltoise who made a do-or-die move into the last corner of the race. He went too fast and ran wide, but hindered Rindt while doing so, which was just as good a result. The top four finished within 0.19 seconds of each other and Stewart was given the win, ahead of Rindt, Beltoise and McLaren. Ickx had retired three laps from the end when he ran out of fuel.

His sixth win of the season gave Jackie Stewart (Matra) an unsurmountable lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. He stood at 60 points, ahead of Bruce McLaren (McLaren) with 24 and Jacky Ickx (Brabham) with 22. Matra now also had enough to be awarded the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup with 60 points, ahead of Lotus with 34 and Brabham with 30.

===Rounds 9 to 11===
After he was injured in a testing accident in June, triple World Champion Jack Brabham returned to the grid for the Canadian Grand Prix. He would finish this season and then retire, also selling his shares of the Brabham team to co-founder Ron Tauranac. In practice, at least three drivers spun or crashed out on the slippery sandy surface of Mosport, but Jacky Ickx managed to qualify on pole position, five tenths ahead of the competition. It was Jochen Rindt, however, that took the lead into the first corner, before freshly crowned champion Jackie Stewart snatched it on lap 6. Behind the leaders, Jean-Pierre Beltoise collided with local driver Al Pease, who was already being lapped before a quarter of the race was run. After this, the Canadian was disqualified for &quot;driving too slowly&quot;, the only time that has ever happened. On lap 33, Ickx overtook Stewart, but their wheels struck and they both spun. Stewart landed in a ditch and stalled his engine, but Ickx could continue to take a suddenly easy victory. Jack Brabham finished second, the Australian&#x27;s first podium of the year, ahead of Rindt in third. Johnny Servoz-Gavin finished sixth, scoring the first and only ever championship point in a four-wheel drive Formula One car.

The United States Grand Prix was the penultimate round of the championship and saw Rindt take his fifth pole position of the year, ahead of Hulme and Stewart. Ickx started down in eighth after a hair-raising spin off the track in practice. After the start, Rindt and Stewart left the field behind and the Scot took the lead on lap 12, when the Austrian made a slight error. Rindt kept pressing, however, and was back in front on lap 21, the two already running half a lap ahead of the competition. On lap 36, Stewart&#x27;s engine suffered an oil leak and he had to retire, leaving Rindt to take, after seven career podiums, his first victory. champion Graham Hill suffered a flat tyre and spun off. His car hit the banks and turning over, violently throwing him out of the car. Hill broke both his legs. Ickx had also retired, so there was room for some other names on the podium: Piers Courage was second in the Brabham run by Frank Williams Racing Cars and champion John Surtees was third for BRM.

In qualifying for the Mexican Grand Prix, Jack Brabham claimed pole with a new lap record. Going into his supposedly final race, the Australian had lost none of his speed, beating the old record by more than a second. Ickx and Stewart started beside him on the front row, and it was the Scot who took the lead, before Ickx took it on lap 2. Stewart then fell back a bit, with fourth-starting Hulme rising to the occasion. On lap 10, the McLaren passed the Brabham for the lead and sailed away. Ickx made two attempts later in the race but was unable to pass the New Zealander, finishing 2.5 seconds behind him. Jack Brabham finished third, Stewart fourth.

Jackie Stewart (Matra) finished first in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 63 points, ahead of Jacky Ickx (Brabham) with 37 and Bruce McLaren (McLaren) with 26. In the standings for the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup, Matra had achieved 66 points, ahead of Brabham with 49 and Lotus with 47.

==Results and standings==
===Grands Prix===
===Scoring system===

Points were awarded to the top six classified finishers. Formula 2 cars were not eligible for Championship points. The International Cup for F1 Manufacturers only counted the points of the highest-finishing driver for each race. For both the Championship and the Cup, the best five results from rounds 1-6 and the best four results from rounds 7-11 were counted.

Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
===World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings===

*1 – Ineligible for Formula One points, because they drove with Formula Two cars.
Formula 2 cars occupied the positions between fifth and tenth at the German GP, but the drivers who drove these cars did not earn points for the championship. The fifth and sixth points went to the eleventh and twelfth in the race, Siffert and Beltoise.

===International Cup for F1 Manufacturers standings===
*Bold results counted to championship totals.

==Non-championship races==
Other Formula One races were held in 1969, which did not count towards the World Championship. The Madrid Grand Prix and Gold Cup were held concurrently with Formula 5000 cars.
