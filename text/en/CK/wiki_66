<text>Sir John Leslie, FRSE KH (10 April 1766 – 3 November 1832) was a Scottish mathematician and physicist best remembered for his research into heat.

Leslie gave the first modern account of capillary action in 1802 and froze water using an air-pump in 1810, the first artificial production of ice.

In 1804, he experimented with radiant heat using a cubical vessel filled with boiling water. One side of the cube is composed of highly polished metal, two of dull metal (copper) and one side painted black. He showed that radiation was greatest from the black side and negligible from the polished side. The apparatus is known as a Leslie cube.

==Early life==
Leslie was born the son of Robert Leslie, a joiner and cabinetmaker, and his wife Anne Carstairs, in Largo in Fife. He received his early education there and at Leven. In his thirteenth year, encouraged by friends who had even then remarked his aptitude for mathematical and physical science, he entered the University of St Andrews. On the completion of his course in 1784, he nominally studied divinity at the University of Edinburgh but gained no further degrees.

From 1788 to 1789 he spent rather more than a year as a private tutor in a Virginian family, and from 1791 until the close of 1792 he held a similar appointment at Etruria, Staffordshire, with the family of Josiah Wedgwood, employing his spare time in experimental research and in preparing a translation of Buffon&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Birds&quot;, which was published in nine volumes in 1793, which brought him money.

==Middle years==

For the next twelve years (passed chiefly in London or at Largo, with an occasional visit to the continent of Europe) he continued his physical studies, which resulted in numerous papers contributed by him to Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Journal&quot;, and in the publication (1804) of the &quot;Experimental Inquiry into the Nature and Properties of Heat&quot;, a work which gained him the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London.

In 1805, after having been rejected in several attempts to obtain a Chair at a Scottish university, Leslie was elected to succeed John Playfair in the chair of mathematics at Edinburgh, despite violent opposition on the part of a party who accused him of heresy.

During his tenure of this chair he published two volumes of &quot;A Course of Mathematics&quot;-the first, entitled &quot;Elements of Geometry, Geometrical Analysis and Plane Trigonometry&quot;, in 1809, and the second, &quot;Geometry of Curve Lines&quot;, in 1813; the third volume, on &quot;Descriptive Geometry and the Theory of Solids&quot; was never completed. With reference to his invention (in 1810) of a process of artificial ice-making, he published in 1813 &quot;A Short Account of Experiments and Instruments depending on the relations of Air to Heat and Moisture&quot;; and in 1818 a paper by him, &quot;On certain impressions of cold transmitted from the higher atmosphere, with an instrument (the aethrioscope) adapted to measure them&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot;.

In 1807 he became a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Playfair, Thomas Charles Hope and George Dunbar.

==Later years==
When John Playfair died in 1819, Leslie was promoted to the more congenial chair of natural philosophy, which he held until his death. He published a famous book about multiplication table &quot;The Philosophy of Arithmetic&quot; in 1820. In 1823 he published, chiefly for the use of his class, the first volume of his never-completed &quot;Elements of Natural Philosophy&quot;.

Leslie&#x27;s main contributions to physics were made by the help of the differential thermometer, an instrument whose invention was contested with him by Count Rumford. By adapting to this instrument various ingenious devices, Leslie was able to employ it in a great variety of investigations, connected especially with photometry, hygroscopy and the temperature of space. In 1820 he was elected a corresponding member of the Institute of France, the only distinction of the kind which he valued, and early in 1832 he was knighted.

In his final years he is listed as living at 62 Queen Street, a large Georgian flat in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town.

Leslie died of typhus in November 1832 (during the epidemic of that year) at Coates, a small property he had acquired near Largo in Fife, at the age of 66. He is buried in Upper Largo under a slab on the south side of the parish church.
Leslie was an atheist.

==Family==
John Leslie did not marry and had no children.

His nephew was the civil engineer, James Leslie, son of his brother, Alexander Leslie, an architect-builder in Largo. His great nephew (James&#x27;s son) was Alexander Leslie.

<doc id="1138168" wikidata="Q28867" url="?curid=1138168" title="Juan Luna">
<text>Juan Luna de San Pedro y Novicio Ancheta (, ; October 25, 1857 – December 7, 1899) was a Filipino painter, sculptor and a political activist of the Philippine Revolution during the late 19th century. He became one of the first recognized Philippine artists.

His winning of the gold medal in the 1884 Madrid Exposition of Fine Arts, along with the silver win of fellow Filipino painter Félix Resurrección Hidalgo, prompted a celebration which was a significant highlight in the memoirs of members of the Propaganda Movement, with the fellow &quot;Ilustrados&quot; toasting the two painters&#x27; good health and the brotherhood between Spain and the Philippines.

Well regarded for work done in the manner of European academies of his time, Luna painted literary and historical scenes, some with an underscore of political commentary. His allegorical works were inspired by classical balance, and often showed figures in theatrical poses.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Born in the town of Badoc, Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines, Luna was the third among the seven children of Joaquín Luna de San Pedro y Posadas and Laureana Novicio y Ancheta. In 1861, the Luna family moved to Manila, and he went to the Ateneo Municipal de Manila where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree. He excelled in painting and drawing and was influenced by his brother, Manuel N. Luna, who, according to Filipino patriot José Rizal, was a better painter than Juan himself.

Luna enrolled at the Escuela Nautica de Manila (now Philippine Merchant Marine Academy) and became a sailor. He took drawing lessons under the illustrious painting teacher Lorenzo Guerrero of Ermita, Manila. He also enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts (Academia de Dibujo y Pintura) in Manila where he was influenced and taught how to draw by the Spanish artist Agustin Saez. Unfortunately, Luna&#x27;s vigorous brush strokes displeased his teacher and Luna was discharged from the academy. However, Guerrero was impressed by his skill and urged Luna to travel to Madrid to further pursue his work.

===Travel abroad===
In 1875 Manuel and Juan Luna travelled to Europe, where Manuel studied music and Juan painting. Juan entered the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he befriended the painter Don Alejo Vera. Luna was unhappy with the style of teaching in the school and decided that it would be much better to work with Vera.

Vera brought him to Rome for some of his commissions, and Luna was exposed to the art of the Renaissance painters. It was in 1878 that his artistic talents were established with the opening of the first art exposition in Madrid, which was called the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Demonstration of Fine Arts). From then on, Luna became engrossed in painting and produced a collection of paintings that he exhibited at the 1881 Exposition.

In 1881, his &quot;La Muerte de Cleopatra&quot; won him a silver medal and came in second place. Luna&#x27;s growing reputation as an artist led to a &quot;pensionado&quot; (pension) scholarship at 600 pesos annually through the Ayuntamiento of Manila. The condition was that he was obliged to develop a painting which captured the essence of Philippine history, which would then become the Ayuntamiento&#x27;s property.

===Artistic career===

In 1883, Luna commenced work on the painting commissioned by the Ayuntamiento. By May 1884, he dispatched the expansive canvas portraying the &quot;Spoliarium&quot; to Madrid for the annual Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes. Remarkably, he became the inaugural recipient of one of three gold medals bestowed at the exhibition, earning recognition from both connoisseurs and art critics in attendance. On June 25, 1884, a gathering of Filipino and Spanish nobles organized an event to celebrate Luna&#x27;s triumph in the exhibition. During the event, Rizal prepared a speech lauding his friend, highlighting the two significant aspects of his artwork—the exaltation of genius and the magnificence of his artistic prowess.

Despite Luna&#x27;s recognition and acclaim for his artistic achievements, he was unjustly denied the esteemed Medal of Honor due to racial prejudice against him as a colonial subject. Nevertheless, King Alfonso XII commissioned Luna to create &quot;La batalla de Lepanto&quot; (&quot;The Battle of Lepanto&quot;) for the halls of the Senate of Spain, intending for it to be displayed alongside Francisco Pradilla Ortiz&#x27;s &quot;La rendicion de Granada&quot; (The Surrender of Granada), the grand prize-winning artwork from the 1878 competition. The king&#x27;s intention was to provide compensation to Luna, who had been overlooked for the Medal of Honor with his renowned work, &quot;Spoliarium&quot;. 

Luna&#x27;s signed and dated 1884 oil canvas portrait of Adele della Rocca, niece of Count Enrico Morozzo Della Rocca, First aide-de-Camp, Honourary General Adjutant to King Umberto, was sold for P31 million at the Leon Gallery auction on September 14, 2024.

In 1885, Luna relocated to Paris, where he established his own studio and formed a friendship with Hidalgo. Honouring an agreement with the Manila City Council, he completed the artwork titled &quot;El pacto de sangre&quot; (The Blood Compact) a year later. This painting portrayed the 1565 &quot;Sandugo&quot; (blood compact ritual) between Datu Sikatuna, a prominent ruler from Bohol Island, and the Spanish governor-general Miguel López de Legazpi, surrounded by other conquistadors. The piece now graces the walls of the Malacañan Palace. This painting and a full-sized portrait of López de Legazpi were completed and returned to Manila in exchange for his scholarship. 

At first, Luna was praised for his grandiose historical works of art in the Graeco-Roman fashion at prestigious European art salons that conformed to classical requirements. However, he became disenchanted with his representations of historical scenes, which he expressed in his writings to his fellow Philippine patriots and like-minded Spanish politicians. Contrary to the presumption of abandonment of academic tradition or a newly found appreciation for impressionism, Luna joined forces with the progressive factions within the Paris Salon.
[[Minerva]] ( [[Museo de Intramuros]])
By 1891, Luna shifted his focus towards creating realist artworks that portrayed the societal ills of his time. Influenced by his readings of economists Karl Marx and Émile Louis Victor de Laveleye, his works began to reflect these influences. In a letter addressed to Rizal, Luna openly embraced his personal affiliation with socialism. An excellent example of Luna&#x27;s shift in artistic style can be seen in his work titled &quot;Les Ignores&quot;. Painted between 1890 and 1891, the work portrays a winter funeral procession for an ordinary labourer, evident from the modest wooden coffin and the attire of the mourners, reflecting their humble status.

Luna&#x27;s commitment to realist art persisted in his other notable works, such as &quot;The Parisian Life&quot; and series on the French Revolution, &quot;Peuple et Rois&quot; (People and Kings).

===Marriage===
On December 4, 1886, Luna married María de la Paz Pardo de Tavera, a sister of his friends Félix and Trinidad Pardo de Tavera. The couple traveled to Venice and Rome and settled in Paris. They had one son, whom they named Andrés, and a daughter, María de la Paz, nicknamed Bibi, who died when she was three years old. Luna was fond of his wife. However, the jealous Luna frequently accused Paz of having an affair with a certain Monsieur Dussaq. Finally in a fit of jealousy, he shot the door wherein his wife was behind, killing his wife and mother-in-law and wounding his brother-in-law Félix in the process, on September 22, 1892. He was arrested and murder charges were filed against him.

Luna was acquitted of the charges on February 8, 1893, on the grounds that it had been a crime of passion. Temporary insanity; the &quot;unwritten law&quot; at the time forgave men for killing unfaithful wives. He was ordered to pay the Pardo de Taveras a sum of 1,651 francs and eighty three cents, and an additional 25 francs for postage, in addition to the one franc of claims for damages (&quot;dommages-intérêts&quot;). Five days later, Luna went to Madrid with his brother, Antonio Luna, and his son, Andrés.

===Final years===

In 1894 Luna moved back to the Philippines and traveled to Japan in 1896, returning during the Philippine Revolution of the Cry of Balintawak. On September 16, 1896, he and his brother Antonio Luna were arrested by Spanish authorities for being involved with the Katipunan rebel army. Despite his imprisonment, Luna was still able to produce a work of art which he gave to a visiting priest. He was pardoned by the Spanish courts on May 27, 1897, and was released from prison and he traveled back to Spain in July. He returned to Manila in November 1898. In 1898, he was appointed by the executive board of the Philippine revolutionary government as a member of the Paris delegation which was working for the diplomatic recognition of the &quot;República Filipina (Philippine Republic)&quot;. In 1899, upon the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1898), Luna was named a member of the delegation to Washington, D.C. to press for the recognition of the Philippine government.

He traveled back to the Philippines in December 1899 upon hearing of the murder of his brother Antonio by the Kawit Battalion in Cabanatuan.

===Death===
He traveled to Hong Kong and died there on December 7, 1899, from cardiac arrest. His remains were buried in Hong Kong and in 1920 were exhumed and kept in Andrés Luna&#x27;s house, to be later transferred to a niche at the Crypt of San Agustin Church in the Philippines. Five years later, Juan would be reinstated as a world-renowned artist and &quot;Peuple et Rois&quot;, his last major work, was acclaimed as the best entry to the Saint Louis World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. Some of his paintings were destroyed by fire in World War II.

<doc id="1138170" wikidata="Q3811181" url="?curid=1138170" title="Julio Toro">
<text>Julio Toro (born November 5, 1943) is a Puerto Rican basketball coach.

Toro is known for emphasizing the mental aspects of the game and making widespread use of philosophical principles, as well as other unorthodox techniques that include the incorporation of visual aids and poetry, which has earned him the nicknames &quot;Jedi Master&quot; and &quot;sensei&quot;.

==International coaching career==
===Puerto Rico national team===
At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, he made history by becoming the first non-Soviet coach to defeat the United States during Olympic competition, and the first coach to defeat an American team composed of NBA players at an Olympics match.

===Venezuela national team===
In 1991, after players Carl Herrera, Gabriel Estaba and Yván Olivares expressed dissatisfaction with then-coach of the Venezuela national basketball team Jesús Córdobés, Francisco Diez (then president of the Instituto Nacional del Deporte) travelled to Puerto Rico with the intention of recruiting Flor Meléndez. However, after negotiations were hindered due to his BSN contract, the coach recommended Toro for the role. Following a successful reunion, he took over the team. In his first competition, Toro led Venezuela to the first place of the South American Tournament, for which received a bonus of only $1,500. Toro returned the following year, when he coached the team to the final of the 1992 FIBA Americas Tournament, losing to the &quot;Dream Team&quot;. He coached until the following year, returning for a final stint in 1997.

==Personal life==
Toro&#x27;s wife, Sibelys Prato, is a native of Venezuela. His eponymous younger son, Julito, who worked as his assistant in 2009-10, died from complications of pneumonia in 2015.

<doc id="1138171" wikidata="Q855704" url="?curid=1138171" title="Semnones">
<text>The Semnones were a Germanic and specifically a Suebi people, located between the Elbe and the Oder in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD.

They were described in the late 1st century by Tacitus in his &quot;Germania&quot;:

&quot;The Semnones give themselves out to be the most ancient and renowned branch of the Suebi. Their antiquity is strongly attested by their religion. At a stated period, all the tribes of the same group assemble by their representatives in a grove consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers, and by immemorial associations of terror. Here, having publicly slaughtered a human victim, they celebrate the horrible beginning of their barbarous rite. Reverence also in other ways is paid to the grove. No one enters it except bound with a chain, as an inferior acknowledging the might of the local divinity. If he chance to fall, it is not lawful for him to be lifted up, or to rise to his feet; he must crawl out along the ground. All this superstition implies the belief that from this spot the nation took its origin, that here dwells the supreme and all-ruling deity, to whom all else is subject and obedient. The fortunate lot of the Semnones strengthens this belief; a hundred cantons are in their occupation, and the vastness of their community makes them regard themselves as the head of the Suebic tribe.&quot;

The Semnones&#x27;s own name is apparently etymologically similar or even the same as the one recorded by Roman authors as &quot;Suebi&quot; and during his own time Julius Caesar, had mentioned Suebi but not Semnones, being a powerful tribal group with 100 cantons. 

The king of the Semnones Masyas and his priestess Ganna are mentioned by Cassius Dio. They worshipped a supreme god () at a sacred grove. A grove of fetters is also mentioned in the eddic poem &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;. Ptolemy&#x27;s map of Germania mentions a forest called Semanus Silva, but a relation to the Semnones is unknown. 

In the 3rd century, the Semnones shifted southwards and eventually ended up as part of the Alemanni people.

<doc id="1138173" wikidata="Q485531" url="?curid=1138173" title="Bank of Korea">
<text>The Bank of Korea (BOK; ) is the central bank of South Korea and issuer of South Korean won. It was established on 12 June 1950 in Seoul, South Korea.

The bank&#x27;s primary purpose is price stability. For that, the bank targets inflation. The 2016–18 target is consumer price inflation of 2.0%.

==History==
===1950–1970===
The Bank of Korea was established on under the Bank of Korea Act passed of , taking over assets and operations from the simultaneously liquidated Bank of Chōsen. It was given a wide range of functions in relation to monetary and financial policy, banking supervision, and foreign exchange policy.

The Korean War began only thirteen days after the bank was created, forcing the Head Office to relocate to Daejon, Daegu and Busan. It returned to Seoul after the Incheon landings. The bank&#x27;s 89 boxes of silver and gold bullion was moved by the military to the Jinhae naval station and then given to the New York Federal Reserve Bank to pay for South Korea&#x27;s entry into the IMF and International Bank of Reconstruction and Development in 1955. The first Bank of Korea notes circulated after June 1950 alongside older notes of the Bank of Chōsen, which were flooded into the market by North Korean forces. To stop a liquidity crisis during the war, the bank instituted a limit on withdrawals of ₩10,000 per week and ₩30,000 per month for households. It also tried to fight inflation with a Maximum Loan Ceiling System in January, 1951 which set quarterly caps on the increase in general loans and required prior approval for special or general purpose loans exceeding 50 million won. The bank repaid $470 million in aid from the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency and Economic Cooperation Administration beginning in 1952.

After the Korean War, inflation remained high with a 48 percent annual increase in wholesale prices in Seoul from 1954 to 1956. The Korea Development Bank (KDB) was created on April 1, 1954 to rebuild the country, taking over former operations of the Japanese-era Chōsen Industrial Bank, but faced opposition from the Bank of Korea which saw it as a threat to centralization under the control of the Minister of Finance. The Bank of Korea underwrote and absorbed five billion hwan of Industrial Rehabilitation Bonds to finance the KDB. Continuing its bid to rein in inflation, the Bank of Korea set credit ceilings, a loan priority system and loan prior approvals. Interest rate policies and reserve requirements of 15 to 30 percent were widely used. In January 1954, the bank dropped reserve requirements to 15 percent to make funds more available, but then raised it back to 25 percent and ultimately dropped to as low as 10 percent by April 1957.

The Korea-US Joint Economic Committee put in place the Fiscal and Monetary Stabilization Plan in 1957. It restricted defense spending and loans and in 1958 instituted education taxes. South Korea had bumper rice harvests and grain prices dropped with surplus agricultural products from the US. The General Banking Act created in 1950 only came into effect in the late 1950s. It focused on privatizing the banking sector and creating regional banks, such as Seoul Bank or Hungop Bank, and encouraged banks to close down branches that were losing money.

When the Democratic Party took power in 1960 after the April 19 Revolution, they pursued fiscal austerity and ended up with significant financial surpluses. The preferential financing system was eliminated and the bank abolished its rediscount ceiling, although quarterly credit ceilings were reimposed. The new government centralized foreign exchange rates and steeply depreciated the hwan relative to the dollar from 500-600 hwan to the dollar to 1,300 from January to February, 1960. Citizens were required to sell their foreign currency through the Bank of Korea.

Following a year of economic stagnation, the May 16 coup led to massive bank runs. The government revised the budget three times in 1961 pursuing an expansionary approach. Money demand dropped by the third quarter and as a result commercial banks had large reserves. On November 1, the government added Monetary Stabilization Bonds with no holding limits on risk-weighted assets and credit ceilings. 
The bank drew up the first Five-Year Economic Development Plan in 1961. The government took a much more hands on approach to monetary policy, stripping the Bank of Korea&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee of many of its previous powers. The government took over control of commercial banks. Meanwhile, the Korea Stock Exchange became a joint stock corporation and witnessed significant speculation which was resolved when the bank financed 38 billion hwan to fund a delivery settlement. In 1962, the hwan was replaced with the won at one-tenth its value. Through 1963, a poor harvest, declining US aid and depletion of foreign currency reserves to pay for imports steeply devalued the won.

Concerned about balance of payments and a high rate of imports, the government instituted a floating exchange rate in 1965 that depreciated the won, increasing exports 37 percent while decreasing imports. Interest rates were rationalized and increased from 20 percent to 36.5 percent. Into 1966, the bank abolished credit ceilings but raised reserve requirements. 1967 marked the reestablishment of regional private banks such as Busan Bank and Daegu Bank.

In November 1969, the government tried to &quot;cool off&quot; the economy which had grown at over 10 percent annually, but had soaring prices and current account deficits, by imposing lending and rediscount ceilings.

===1970s===
The economy faced a slowdown with inflation and current account deficits tied to the 1973 fuel crisis. Between 1974 and 1976 it created the National Investment Fund and the Export-Import Bank of Korea to finance chemical and heavy industry. Although the country benefited from a late 1970s construction boom in the Middle East, inflation remained high. The August 3 Emergency Economic Measure in 1972 lowered banks&#x27; lending rates. The National Investment Fund Act served to finance its growing industrial base.

===1980s===
The annual growth rate dropped from 9 percent to 7.1 percent due to the rise in raw material costs worldwide with the 1979 energy crisis. In 1980, the won was devalued and then left to have a floating exchange rate. Between June and December, three stimulus packages were created setting a 25 percent increase in the money supply growth target, but the economy registered negative growth and 30 percent inflation.

The government implemented zero-based budgeting in 1983 and the bank tightened the money supply through the mid-1980s. The fiscal tightening brought sustained growth and reined in raw material prices. The Long-Term Plan for Capital Market Internationalization in 1981 granted foreigners an opportunity to make direct investments in the domestic securities market. Between 1982 and 1983, non-bank financial institutions such as mutual savings, an investment trust company and short-term financing groups were allowed to open up. Foreigners were allowed partial equity stakes in domestic companies after August, 1989 and banks exchange rates were liberalized a month later under pressure from the US to let the won appreciate.

The 1980s were also a major time for sponsoring technology, with a 10 tax deduction on technology research and development costs as well as the creation of the Korea Technology Development Corporation to offer venture capital. 

===1990s===
Prices rose in the early 1990s and current account shifted to a deficit due to high oil prices worldwide. The government created the Five-Year Plan for a New Economy, a transportation tax and a tax for rural development and liberalized interest rates. Financial transactions were required to be carried out with real names. Foreign investors were allowed to invest directly in the Korea Stock Exchange, raised the ceiling on overseas portfolio investment and deregulated overseas direct investment. 
The 1997 East Asian financial crisis was compounded by insolvency issues at Kia Motors. Market liquidity dried up as banks refused to lend and major Korean firms such as the Hanbo Group declared bankruptcy. The bond market was opened to foreign investors in 1998 and credit cards were deregulated. The IMF, the US and Japan extended $58 billion to South Korea in financial aid. Banks had to submit Business Normalization Plans and Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank were recapitalized by the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank of Korea purchased two trillion won of bonds in the Non-Performing Asset Resolution Fund to restructure financial institutions. 

===21st Century===
Deregulation of credit cards led to significant lending after 1999 and a high delinquency ratio, which kicked off a financial crisis when an accounting scandal was revealed at SK Global on March 11, 2003. The Bank of Korea launched a short-term liquidity of two trillion won in repurchase agreements to prevent the crisis from spreading. Housing prices rose steadily after 2001 due to deregulation and increased liquidity. In Seoul, prices rose 30.7 percent in 2002 alone. Foreigners owned 43.9 percent of Korean stocks. 
During the 2008 financial crisis, kicked off the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates in 2006 (after a period of low interest rates globally since the early 2000s) resulting in foreclosures. The Bank of Korea injected liquidity and lowered its base rates. 

In 2013 Suh Young-kyung was appointed as the first female executive in the history of the bank; she was appointed as a deputy governor.

==Primary Purpose==

The primary purpose of the Bank is to pursue price stability.

Under the Bank of Korea Act (Article 1), the primary purpose of the Bank of Korea is pursuing price stability so as to contribute to the sound development of the national economy. The Bank of Korea implements this target through adjustments to its reference interest rate, the Base Rate.

The purchasing power of money depends on prices. When prices rise, the same amount of money buys less than before. Therefore, it is naturally the task of a central bank to safeguard the value of the money by keeping inflation low.

Prices are influenced by various factors such as corporate investment, household consumption and international prices of raw materials. Meanwhile, among the various policy instruments to bring about price stability, the monetary policy of a central bank, which adjusts the quantity of money in circulation, is the most effective.

For these reasons, the responsibility for price stability is given to central banks in most countries. The Bank sets and announces an inflation target for a certain period and strives to meet this target. The 2016–18 target is consumer price inflation of 2.0%.

== Organization ==

===Monetary Policy Committee===
At the apex of the Bank of Korea&#x27;s organization is the Monetary Policy Committee (&quot;Geumnyung Tonghwa Wiwonhoe&quot;). The Committee&#x27;s prime function is the formulation of monetary and credit policies. In addition, the Committee deliberates and resolves on major matters concerning the operations of the Bank of Korea.

The Monetary Policy Committee is composed of seven members representing various groups in the national economy:
# the Governor, &quot;ex officio&quot;;
# the Senior Deputy Governor, &quot;ex officio&quot;;
# one member recommended by the Minister of Economy and Finance;
# one member recommended by the Governor;
# one member recommended by the Chairman of the Financial Services Commission;
# one member recommended by the Chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry;
# one member recommended by the Chairman of the Korea Federation of Banks.

The members are appointed by the President for four-year terms except the Senior Deputy Governor whose term is three years and are eligible for reappointment. All members serve on a full-time basis and no member may be discharged from office against his will. The Governor serves concurrently as the Chairman of the Committee.

===Executive and Auditor===
The executive of the Bank of Korea consists of the Governor, the Senior Deputy Governor, and five or fewer Deputy Governors.

The governor, appointed by the President on the deliberation of the State Council, represents the Bank. The term of office of the Governor is four years and the governor may be reappointed once. The Governor conducts policies formulated by the Monetary Policy Committee as the chief executive officer of the bank, keeps the Committee informed about current matters requiring its attention and provides the bank with materials and advice necessary for the resolution of its policies. In addition, the Governor may attend and opine on matters related to money and credit at the State Council.

The Senior Deputy Governor assists the Governor and is appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Governor. The Deputy Governors are appointed by the Governor and undertake their respective duties in the manner stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation of the Bank of Korea.

==Functions==
===Issuing Banknotes and Coins===
The Bank of Korea has the exclusive right to issue banknotes and coins in the Republic of Korea. Their dimensions, designs and denominations are determined by the Monetary Policy Committee with Government approval. The banknotes and coins thus issued have the status of legal tender within the country for all transactions, both public and private, without limitation.

Currently, there are four different denominations of banknotes in circulation: ₩1,000, ₩5,000, ₩10,000 and ₩50,000
and four denominationf of coins: ₩10, ₩50, ₩100 and ₩500.

===Conducting Monetary and Credit Policy===
The most important mission of the Bank of Korea is formulating and implementing monetary and credit policy. This is a process of controlling the supply or cost of money in order that the economy may grow in a sound manner on the basis of price stability. To this end, the Bank conducts monetary and credit policy with an emphasis on price stability while taking into consideration such matters as economic growth and financial market stability.

In order to achieve the ultimate goal of maintaining price stability, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank sets the Base Rate every month after overall consideration of price movements, economic activity and financial market conditions. Then the Bank steers the call rate to converge on the newly-set level of the Base Rate using its policy instruments. The change in the call rate affects market interest rates such as yields on CDs and Treasury bonds, and banks&#x27; deposit and loan interest rates. These changes in interest rates tend to influence consumption and investments and, as a result, inflation.

The Bank&#x27;s monetary policy is conducted mainly through open market operations, apart from which the Bank uses lending and deposit facilities and reserve requirements policy.

===Bankers&#x27; Bank and Government&#x27;s Bank===
The Bank of Korea makes loans to and receives deposits from banks, thus serving as the banker to the banking sector.

The Bank conducts credit operations with banks by rediscounting commercial bills or by extending loans against eligible collateral with maturities of up to one year.

As the lender of last resort, the Bank may extend exceptional loans to banking institutions in periods of serious emergency.

As the fiscal agent of the government of the Republic of Korea, the Bank of Korea carries out various kinds of businesses for the government in accordance with the Bank of Korea Act and other relevant laws.

===Developing and Managing Payment Systems===
The Bank of Korea has onus for the operation and management of the nation&#x27;s payment systems.

The Bank provides settlement facilities to financial intermediaries by use of their current accounts with the Bank for final settlement purposes.

The Bank operated a real-time gross settlement system for large-value interbank fund transfers, named BOK-Wire, since mid-December 1994. BOK-Wire was renamed BOK-Wire+ in April 2009, when a hybrid system was added to the system with such features as a continuous bilateral and multilateral offsetting mechanism.

===Conducting Supervisory Functions for Financial Institutions===
The Bank of Korea conducts supervisory functions for financial institutions as stipulated in the Bank of Korea Act and other related financial acts. The Bank may request information from banks and from non-bank financial institutions that enter into agreements to hold current account with it, when it deems necessary for the implementation of monetary policy.

The Bank may request the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to examine financial institutions within a determined specific range. It may also require the FSS to have staff of the Bank participate on a joint basis in the examination of financial institutions.

===Compilation of Statistics and Economic Research===
The Bank compiles statistics which are essential to developing appropriate economic policies across all sectors including government. These include money and banking statistics, national income statistics, the producer price index, balance of payments statistics, flow of funds statistics, input-output tables, etc.

The Bank carries out research on national and worldwide economic developments in order to formulate effective monetary policy and help advise the government on various economic policy options. It also publishes various periodicals, such as the Annual Report and the Monthly and Quarterly Bulletins, to provide accurate and up-to-date information on the economy to the public.

===Carrying out Foreign Exchange Business and Managing the Official Foreign Reserves===
The Bank of Korea does not have targets for the exchange rate and leaves it to be determined in the market. The Bank, however, does occasionally conduct smoothing operations in concert with the government in order to moderate disorderly movements prompted by herd behavior and the like.

To enhance the soundness of the foreign exchange sector, the Bank strives to maintain Korea&#x27;s external debts at an appropriate level through monitoring inflows and outflows of foreign exchange and inspects and oversees the foreign exchange transactions of banks. The Bank also enters into currency swap agreements with other central banks to ensure ready access to foreign currencies when markets are disorderly.

The Bank holds and manages the nation&#x27;s foreign reserves at an appropriate level so that they serve as a safeguard in emergencies. The Bank invests the reserves mainly in safe and liquid foreign financial assets and strives to improve their profitability insofar as this does not detract from their safety.

===Promoting Cooperation with Other Central Banks===
The Bank maintains close cooperation with other central banks and exchanges information and views with other policy-makers within multilateral organizations such as the BIS and IMF. The Bank also holds international seminars and workshops to share the nation&#x27;s experience in having achieved remarkable economic development and overcoming financial crises. In recent years, The Bank has taken a leading role in establishing a global financial safety net as the central bank of the G-20 Summit chair nation.

<text>was a village located in Seta District, Gunma Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 10,205 and a density of 540.23 persons per km2. The total area was 18.89 km2.

On February 20, 2006, Kitatachibana, along with the town of Ikaho, the villages of Komochi and Onogami (all from Kitagunma District), and the village of Akagi (also from Seta District), was merged into the expanded city of Shibukawa.

Although it was officially referred to as &quot;Kitatachibana Village&quot;, the local residents commonly used the alternate pronunciation &quot;Hokkitsu&quot;. With the 2006 merger, the &quot;Kitatachibana&quot; pronunciation was discarded, and the &quot;Hokkitsu&quot; pronunciation instated as the official one of this district of the new Shibukawa City.

<text>Konstantin Alexander Wecker (born 1 June 1947) is a German &quot;Liedermacher&quot; (singer-songwriter) who also works as a composer, author and actor.

==Life and work==
Wecker was born in Munich. Classically educated at the Wilhelmsgymnasium, Wecker got one of his first jobs as a songwriter at Munich&#x27;s cabaret &quot;Münchner Lach- und Schießgesellschaft&quot; in 1973. His breakthrough as a singer came in 1977 with the record &quot;Genug ist nicht genug&quot; (&quot;Enough Is Not Enough&quot;), which includes the popular talking blues &quot;Willy,&quot; about a presumably close friend of Wecker&#x27;s who was slain by drunken Nazis.

Wecker has released more than forty albums, and has also composed music for film, theater, and children&#x27;s musicals.

In 2003, Wecker became a public opponent of the Iraq War, joining his leftist &quot;Liedermacher&quot; colleagues Hannes Wader and Reinhard Mey.

In March 2006, Wecker was forced to cancel a scheduled performance in the small town of Halberstadt, Saxony-Anhalt. This came after the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) pressured local authorities and threatened to forcibly disrupt the concert. Wecker pledged to return to Halberstadt in the summer of 2006, and eventually performed in Halberstadt on 17 June 2006, accompanied by fellow singer-songwriter Hannes Wader and Afghan percussionist Hakim Ludin.

<text>During the decade of the 2000s many Scottish bands and individual performers made recordings in the rock, Scottish folk, Celtic fusion, and other genres. Scottish music received support from two public bodies: the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Enterprise. Scotland&#x27;s largest city Glasgow was described by &quot;Time magazine&quot; in 2004 as &quot;Europe&#x27;s capital of rock music&quot;, and became a UNESCO City of Music in 2008. The decade brought the deaths of Scottish musicians Kirsty MacColl and Martyn Bennett.

<doc id="1138182" wikidata="Q568338" url="?curid=1138182" title="Limited liability">
<text>Limited liability is a legal status in which a person&#x27;s financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, most commonly the value of a person&#x27;s investment in a corporation, company, or joint venture. If a company that provides limited liability to its investors is sued, then the claimants are generally entitled to collect only against the assets of the company, not the assets of its shareholders or other investors. A shareholder in a corporation or limited liability company is not personally liable for any of the debts of the company, other than for the amount already invested in the company and for any unpaid amount on the shares in the company, if any—except under special and rare circumstances that permit &quot;piercing the corporate veil.&quot; The same is true for the members of a limited liability partnership and the limited partners in a limited partnership. By contrast, sole proprietors and partners in general partnerships are each liable for all the debts of the business (unlimited liability).

Although a shareholder&#x27;s liability for the company&#x27;s actions is limited, the shareholders may still be liable for their own acts. For example, the directors of small companies (who are frequently also shareholders) are often required to give personal guarantees of the company&#x27;s debts to those lending to the company. They will then be liable for those debts that the company cannot pay, although the other shareholders will not be so liable. This is known as co-signing. A shareholder who is also an employee of the corporation may be personally liable for actions the employee takes in that capacity on behalf of the corporation, in particular torts committed within the scope of employment.

Limited liability for shareholders for &quot;contracts&quot; entered by the corporation is not controversial because this could and probably would be agreed to by both parties to the contract. However, limited liability for shareholders for &quot;torts&quot; (or harms that have not been agreed to in advance) is controversial because of concerns that such limited liability could lead to excessive risk-taking by companies and more negative externalities (i.e., more harm to third parties) than would be produced in the absence of limited liability. According to one estimate, negative corporate externalities on an annual basis are equal to between 5 and 20 percent of U.S. GDP.

An issue in liability exposure is whether the assets of a parent entity and the sole owner need to be subject to the subsidiary&#x27;s liabilities, when the subsidiary is declared insolvent and owes debt to its creditors. As a general principle of corporate law, in the United States, a parent entity and the sole owner are not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. However, they may be liable for its subsidiaries&#x27; obligations when the law supports &quot;piercing the corporate veil&quot;.

Provided that the parent entity or the sole owner do not maintain separate legal identities from the subsidiary (through inadequate/ undocumented transfer of funds and assets), the judgment is likely to be in favor of the creditor. In the same regard, if a subsidiary is undercapitalized from its inception, that may be grounds for piercing the corporate veil. Further, if injustice/fraud to the creditor is proven, the parent entity or the owner may be held liable to compensate the creditor. Thus, there is not one characteristic that defines the piercing of a corporate veila factors test is used to determine if piercing is appropriate or not.

If shares are issued &quot;part-paid,&quot; then the shareholders are liable, when a claim is made against the capital of the company, to pay to the company the balance of the face or par value of the shares.

== History ==
By the 15th century, English law had awarded limited liability to monastic communities and trade guilds with commonly held property. In the 17th century, joint stock charters were awarded by the crown to monopolies such as the East India Company. The world&#x27;s first modern limited liability law was enacted by the state of New York in 1811. In England it became more straightforward to incorporate a joint stock company following the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, although investors in such companies carried unlimited liability until the Limited Liability Act 1855.

There was a degree of public and legislative distaste for a limitation of liability, with fears that it would cause a drop in standards of probity. The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). Insurance companies were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the Companies Act 1862. The minimum number of members necessary for registration as a limited company was reduced to seven by the Companies Act 1856. Limited companies in England and Wales now require only one member.

Similar statutory regimes were in place in France and in the majority of the U.S. states by 1860. By the final quarter of the nineteenth century, most European countries had adopted the principle of limited liability. The development of limited liability facilitated the move to large-scale industrial enterprise, by removing the threat that an individual&#x27;s total wealth would be confiscated if invested in an unsuccessful company. Large sums of personal financial capital became available, and the transferability of shares permitted a degree of business continuity not possible in other forms of enterprise.

In the UK there was initially a widespread belief that a corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only partly paid, as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable for the remainder of the nominal value in case the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to £1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866–1867) and the Long Depression (1873–1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid.

Although it was admitted that those who were mere investors ought not to be liable for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout the late nineteenth century there were still many arguments for unlimited liability for managers and directors on the model of the French &quot;société en commandite&quot;. Such liability for directors of English companies was abolished in 2006. Further, it became increasingly common from the end of the nineteenth century for shareholders to be directors, protecting themselves from liability.

In 1989, the European Union enacted its Twelfth Council Company Law Directive, requiring that member states make available legal structures for individuals to trade with limited liability. This was implemented in England and Wales in the Companies (Single Member Private Limited Companies) Regulations 1992, which allowed single-member limited-liability companies.

== Justification ==
Some argue that limited liability is related to the concept of separate legal personality bestowed on the corporate form, which is promoted as encouraging entrepreneurship by various economists, enabling large sums to be pooled towards an economically beneficial purpose.

Limited liability has been justified as promoting investment and capital formation by reassuring risk averse investors.

== Criticisms ==
An early critic of limited liability, Edward William Cox, a lifelong member of the Conservative Party, wrote in 1855:
Others argue that while some limited liability is beneficial, the privilege ought not to extend to liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury because this leads to excessive risk-taking and negative externalities by corporations. Others argue that limited liability should be permitted, but should be taxed more heavily to offset the harm that limited liability causes. Such taxes could be structured to generate information for regulators about how risky the activities companies are undertaking are to third parties.

The notion of corporate limited liability has met criticism from certain figures among the libertarian right. In &quot;For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto&quot;, Murray N. Rothbard approvingly quoted Robert Poole, a fellow libertarian, who stated that a &quot;libertarian society would be a full-liability society where everyone is fully responsible for his actions and any harmful consequences they might cause.&quot;

== Maritime claims ==

The 1957 Brussels Convention and the 1976 London Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims permit the charterer, manager, operators and salvors of a ship, and the master and members of the crew, to limit their liability for damage caused by events occurring &quot;on board or in direct connection with the operation of the ship, or with salvage operations&quot; and for &quot;consequential loss resulting therefrom.&quot;

<text>Lombard Bank Malta Plc is one of Malta&#x27;s major banks, together with Bank of Valletta, HSBC Bank Malta and APS Bank. The Government of Malta through the National Development and Social Fund (NDSF) owns 49.1% of the bank. It acquired these shares from the now defunct Cyprus Popular Bank. Over 1,200 shareholders, and investment funds, hold the remaining shares. The bank has a 71.5% stake in MaltaPost plc., the Maltese national postal operator.

==Branches==
The bank operates a network of seven branches in Malta and Gozo, with its head office at Spinola Palace in 67 Republic Street, Valletta. The branches are located in:

*Valletta – 67 Republic Street
*Sliema – 225 Tower Road
*St. Julian&#x27;s – Paceville Avenue
*Qormi – San Bastjan – 82 St Sebastian Street
*Qormi – San Gorg – 4 Main Street
*Balzan – Balzan Valley
*Victoria – Gozo – Ninu Cremona Street

A 24-Hour Lombard CashPoint ATM is located in every branch (except Qormi San Gorg) and in other offsite locations.

==Chronology==
The bank dates back to 1955 when Lombard North Central of the United Kingdom started taking deposits in Malta through a number of agents.

*1958: National Provincial Bank Ltd. (now National Westminster Bank Plc) acquired North Central Finance Ltd. (now Lombard North Central Plc).
*1969: Lombard North Central established Lombard Bank (Malta) (now Lombard Bank Malta).
*1975: The Maltese government purchased 25% of Lombard Bank Malta.
*1981: The Maltese government purchased 35% of Lombard Bank Malta.
*1988: NatWest, unable to find a buyer, sold its remaining shares to the government.
*1990: In April 1990 the bank became a Public Limited Company and offered equity to the public. The issue was five times oversubscribed and the government subsequently totally divested its shareholding.
*1994: Lombard Bank Malta was listed on the Malta stock exchange. The government sold 21% of the shares (Lombard North Central&#x27;s remaining stake) to Malaysian entrepreneur Robert Tan Hua Choon.
*1998: CCF Holdings (Suisse) acquired Tan&#x27;s 21%.
*2000: HSBC Holdings acquired Credit Commercial de France and with it the stake in Lombard Malta.
*2002: HSBC sold its shares in Lombard Bank Malta to Swiss-based Banca Unione di Credito, which then owned 26%.
*2006: Lombard Bank Malta acquired Transend Worldwide&#x27;s 35% shareholding in Maltapost Plc. Transend Worldwide, a New Zealand company, was instrumental in restructuring Maltapost over the previous four years.
*2006: Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI) acquired Banca Unione di Credito.
*2007: Cyprus Popular Bank (formerly Marfin Popular Bank) acquired 43% of the share capital from BSI and other international investors for €48 million.

<text>The Madawaska River flows from Lake Témiscouata in Quebec, through Degelis, Quebec, to join the Saint John River at Edmundston, New Brunswick.

The course of the Madawaska River is accessible in Quebec by route 185 and New Brunswick by Highway 2, which run along the river side South West.

==Toponymy==
Various theories exist over the etymology of the word Madawaska. One is that the river&#x27;s name comes from the Algonquian word &quot;Madoueskak&quot;, which means &quot;land of the porcupine&quot;. In Maliseet, the word &quot;Matawaskiyak&quot; translates to &quot;at the place where water flows out over grass&quot;, there is also speculation that it refers to the &#x27;meeting of two rivers where there is grass&#x27;. The Madawaska river is a large drainage basin for Lake Temiscouata and other waterways from the north. Before the city of Edmundston changed the natural course of the river, the spring freshet would cause several branches of the river to flood the land resulting in various waterfalls.

The river formed part of the Témiscouata Portage, a canoe and land route from the Bay of Fundy to the Saint Lawrence River dating from the late 17th century. A road, now Route 185 and part of the Trans-Canada Highway, was built along this route in 1862. The Témiscouata Railway was built along the same route in 1886. In the early 20th century, timber and logs were floated down the river to New Brunswick.

The Petit Témis Interprovincial Linear Park is a rail trail running from Edmundston, NB to Cabano, QC in the abandoned CN rail corridor that was originally built by the Temiscouata Railway.

The toponym &quot;Madawaska River&quot; was officialized as of December 8, 1968, at Commission de toponymie du Québec (Quebec Geographical Names Board).

== Course of the river ==
The Madawaska River originates in Lake Témiscouata, about meters. The river follows a winding course generally oriented on South-East. The river runs through successively Dégelis, Quebec, in Quebec; then the parish of Saint-Jacques Parish and Edmundston, in Madawaska County, in New Brunswick. The river empties into the left side of Saint John River in downtown Edmundston and facing the American town of Madawaska.

The Madawaska River flows over generally towards the Southeast:

Upper river courses (in Quebec) (segment of )

From the dam at the mouth of Lake Témiscouata, the Madawaska River flows over:

* to the South in a big S, passing at the East side of the &quot;Mont Sainte-Anne&quot;, up to the bridge of the 7th Street in Dégelis;
* to the Southeast, bypassing the island Beaupré and passing southwest of a mountain, up to the confluence of the Birches River (Madawaska River) (from the North);
* to the Southeast, forming a detour to the North, and then collecting the waters of Griffin Creek (from the Southwest), up to the confluence of the Languedoc creek (from North);
* to the Southeast, passing on the Northeast of Edmundston airport, up to the border between Quebec and New Brunswick. Note: A marsh area (West side of the river) runs along the end of this segment on .

Lower course of the river (at New Brunswick) (segment of )

From the border between Quebec and New Brunswick, the Madawaska River flows:

* to the Southeast, up to Island Brook (from the Northeast);
* to the Southeast, bypassing four islands, up to the bridge of the village of Saint-Jacques Parish;
* to the Southeast, through the village of Saint-Jacques Parish up to the railway bridge Canadian National Railway;
* to the Southeast, passing under a road bridge to its confluence

== Dams ==

===Dam of Lake Témiscouata===
The river actually begins its course at the foot of the dam Lake Temiscouata. The dam, built in 1930 by the &quot;St. John River Storage Company&quot;, was acquired by Hydro-Québec during nationalization of electricity in 1963. It was completely rebuilt between 1993 and 1994.

The construction of this dam has had the effect of raising the lake level of about sixty centimeters above the normal high water level, set at , to reach the level of . The dam allows for storing of additional water from Lake Témiscouata, less than 6% of the volume of water contained naturally in the lake. Another consequence of the enhancement of Lake Témiscouata is the relative youth of the shores which limits the number of natural beaches and potential for recreation.

<text>Kingaroy () is a rural town and locality in the South Burnett Region, Queensland, Australia. The town is situated on the junction of the D&#x27;Aguilar and the Bunya Highways, north-west of the state capital Brisbane and south west of Gympie. In the , the locality of Kingaroy had a population of 10,266 people.

Kingaroy is the seat of the South Burrnett Region. It is known as the &quot;Peanut Capital of Australia&quot; because Australia&#x27;s largest peanut processing plant is located in the town and its peanut silo dominates the skyline. Kingaroy is also known as the hometown of former Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

== Geography ==
Kingaroy is surrounded by extensive (and very picturesque) farmlands interspersed with low rolling hills. The Booie Range lies immediately north-east of the town and the Bunya Mountains about to the south-west. 

The Stuart River () flows northwards on the western outskirts of the town. The locality is part of the Burnett River catchment. The productive lands of the catchment feature sedimentary floodplains. The rich fertile soils of the floodplains are the agricultural and resource backbone of the region. While there are benefits of the flooding there are also risks including the loss of vegetation in riparian zones, biosecurity issues and spread of weed species. 

The locality sits in the Tarong Coal Basin. 

Kingaroy varies in altitude / elevation / height above sea level from about (highlight point) to (highlight point) above sea level. 

Edenvale is a neighbourhood within the locality (), which takes its name from the Edenvale railway station which was named on 15 March 1911 by the Queensland Railways Department, because the land for the railway station was resumed from &quot;Paradise Farm&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Kingaroy experiences an elevation-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa), with very warm, relatively wet summers and mild, dry winters with cold nights. Annual precipitation averages , with a summer maximum. Record temperatures have ranged from on 12 February 2017 to on 18 July 1961.

The original weather station at Kingaroy&#x27;s Prince Street had been recording rainfall since 1905 and temperatures since 1947. However, it closed in 2000, in favour of the new, more advanced weather station at the town&#x27;s airport SW.
== Etymology ==
The origin of the name Kingaroy is usually claimed to be derived from the Wakka Wakka Aboriginal word for &#x27;Red Ant&#x27;. The local Kingaroy Rugby League football team is known as &quot;the Red Ants&quot; and a Red Ant features on the old Kingaroy Shire coat of arms. A Wakka Wakka Word List provides the following explanation: &quot;Derived from &#x27;king&#x27;, a small black ant, and &#x27;dhu&#x27;roi&#x27;, meaning hungry. The name was suggested by a local Aboriginal helper of the surveyor, Hector Munro, who surveyed the original grazing holding of this name, on account of these ants being a pest at the survey camp.&quot;. Munro selected Wakka Wakka words describing various species of ants when he surveyed a number of local towns, including Taabinga (dha&#x27; be&#x27;ngga) and Mondure (mon&#x27;dhur).

== History ==
Wakka Wakka (Waka Waka, Wocca Wocca, Wakawaka) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the Burnett River catchment. The Wakka Wakka language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the North and South Burnett Regional Council, particularly the towns of Cherbourg, Murgon, Kingaroy, Gayndah, Eidsvold and Mundubbera.

Rural settlement of the area dates back to 1843 when one of the first selections was made at Burrandowan (west of Kingaroy) by squatter and explorer Henry Stuart Russell. Even through Russell was reputedly the first European to realise the potential of the South Burnett, it was Simon Scott of Taromeo (now Blackbutt) and the Haly brothers of Taabinga who brought the first flocks of sheep to the area in the late 1850s.

In 1878, the district where Kingaroy now stands was settled by the Markwell brothers. When the first resumptions were made from the enormous Taabinga holding, the brothers selected two adjoining areas and in 1883 these leases were converted to freehold and became known as the &#x27;Kingaroy Paddock&#x27;. The corner of this paddock was located on what is now known as Haly Street, named after the brothers who settled at Taabinga Station about south-west of present-day Kingaroy. A small, prosperous village grew up around Taabinga in the 1890s.

The opening of the 5th stage of Nanango railway line to its terminus at Kingaroy railway station in the newly laid-out town of Kingaroy (known as the 56-mile peg) in 1904 led to a land explosion around Kingaroy and the development of Kingaroy as it now exists. Taabinga quickly declined into a ghost town by the end of World War I and today the original Taabinga Homestead and a few outbuildings are all that remain of it. The area opposite Kingaroy Airport is today known as &quot;Taabinga Village&quot; but is really only a suburb of Kingaroy.

Taabinga Village Provisional School opened on 10 August 1897. On 1 January 1909, it became Taabinga Village State School. On 16 July 1961, Taabinga Village State School was closed and pupils transferred to the new Taabinga State School in Kingaroy.

Malar Provisional School opened in 1901. On 1 January 1909, it became Malar State School. There were a number of temporary closures until the school closed permanently in 1955. The school was &quot;via Kingaroy&quot;.

Mount Jones Provisional School opened on 20 January 1902. In 1905, it was renamed Kingaroy Provisional School. On 1 January 1909, it became Kingaroy State School. On 19 February 191,8 a secondary department was added, which was discontinued in 1958 when Kingaroy State High School opened.

Logboy Provisional School opened on 22 April 1902. On 1 January 1909, it became Logboy State School. It was at 289 Weens Road (). In 1911, it was moved to 215–227 Siefert Street, Crawford, and renamed Crawford State School, opening with 29 students.

The first Kingaroy Post Office opened by 1902 (a receiving office had been open from 1895) and was renamed Taabinga Village in 1905, when Kingaroy Railway Station office opened. This was renamed Kingaroy in 1907. The Taabinga Village office closed in 1929.

Erin Vale State School opened in 1911. In 1912 it was renamed Stuart Valley State School. It closed in 1961. It was &quot;via Kingaroy&quot;.

Kingaroy&#x27;s first general hospital opened on 19 November 1914. Prior the only hospital located in Kingaroy was St. Aubyn&#x27;s private hospital, which opened in 1910. Clydebank Hospital became Kingaroy&#x27;s second private hospital, which later became a hostel for children. Kingaroy&#x27;s new public hospital was opened 7 October 1839.The foundation stone of the Kingaroy Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Rotunda was laid on 25 April 1922 (ANZAC Day) by the RSL president Sergeant Norman Booth. It was dedicated on 29 June 1932 by Mayor-General Sir Thomas William Glasgow.

The Kingaroy Branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association was established 22 August 1922 with Florence Daphne Youngman of Taabinga Homestead as the first president. In 1926 her husband Arthur Youngman donated land at 122 Kingaroy Street and Charlie Gills built the first rooms. On 24 November 1956 a hall was built at the rear of the rooms to allow for catering of weddings and functions.

St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School opened in January 1929. In 1980 it merged with St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Secondary School to become South Burnett Catholic College.

The town&#x27;s wastewater treatment plant was established circa 1940 with the treated water being discharged into the Stuart River. A major upgrade occurred between 2014 2016 resulting greater processing capacity at greater efficiency with treated water now being recycled for use on sporting fields and the golf course.

The Royal Australian Air Force had a significant operational and training presence in the region during the World War II, the first squadrons deploying to the town&#x27;s airport about mid-1942. At least eight squadrons were based at RAAF Kingaroy then (viz. Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 15, 75, 92 and 93 Squadrons), together with No. 3 Initial Training School. Aircraft operated there by the RAAF included Avro Ansons, CAC Wirraways, DAP Beauforts, DH Mosquitos, Curtiss P-40E Kittyhawks and Bristol Beaufighters. Kingaroy R.A.A.F. Post Office was open from 7 August 1942 until 28 February 1946.

The presence of the US Army in Queensland generally and more particularly in Kingaroy created a need to supply them with very large quantities of navy beans (known as baked beans in Australia) which led to widespread planting of navy beans in the Kingaroy area from 1940 with seed supplied by the US Army. Such was the military importance of navy beans that all war-time production of navy beans was done under contract to the Australian Government and subject to the National Security Act. After the war, the industry struggled with a number of issues including tariffs, marketing, processing and being controlled from Brisbane. With the vast majority of bean growers in Queensland being in the Kingaroy area and following the destruction of the processing factory in Toowoomba, local growers decided to form a co-operative based in Kingaroy to process and market the product locally on a site provided by Kingaroy Shire Council who wanted to encourage the project. Since 1993, the cooperative is known as Bean Growers Australia.

St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Secondary School opened in 1946. In 1980 it merged with St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School to become South Burnett Catholic College.

Kingaroy State High School opened on 28 January 1958, replacing the secondary department at Kingaroy State School.

South Burnett Catholic College opened in 1980, as the merger of St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary and Secondary Schools.

Kingaroy Christian College opened on 24 April 1984 and closed on 6 May 1999. The college had buried a time capsule on 24 April 1994. On 16 April 2013, former students dug up the time capsule with the assistance of the owners of the former school site. The time capsule contained a number of small items including a floppy disk.

St John&#x27;s Lutheran Primary School opened on 23 January 1989 with 26 students and 2 teachers. The school was established by relocating the school buildings from the closed Mannuem Creek State School in Mannuem. In 2014 the school expanded to offer junior secondary schooling (Years 7 to 9).

Kingaroy celebrated its centenary in 2004.

Kingaroy is also noted for being the first region in Australia to be placed on Level 7 Water Restrictions, which occurred on 1 October 2007.

In 2017, Kingaroy Magistrates and District Court underwent a $5.3 million refurbishment. The improvements included a full internal and external refurbishment and a new secure interview room for witnesses to give evidence. The courthouse was officially opened on 6 February 2018 by Queensland Attorney-General Yvette D’Ath.

== Economy ==

Traditionally, Kingaroy has always been the centre of Australia&#x27;s peanut and navy bean industries but since the early 1990s it has also developed into one of the twin hubs of the South Burnett&#x27;s rapidly expanding wine industry (the other hub is at Murgon, Redgate and Moffatdale, to the north). 

Droughts and uncertainty surrounding the region&#x27;s annual peanut crop led some farmers to diversify and grow grapes. Rich volcanic soil, hot dry summers and cold winters proved to be ideal conditions for wine growing. Quite a number of vineyards were established in the region, and the success of their wine enables the South Burnett region, which includes Kingaroy, to promote the area as a tourist destination. The success of these enterprises has been largely attributed to the scenery of the location, and has benefited the local economy.

Bean Growers Australia is a cooperative association with its headquarters at 82-84 River Road () where it has its processing factory. Its members grow a range of beans including soybeans, adzuki beans, navy beans, mungbeans, chickpeas, black eye beans, field peas, linseed and popcorn.

Other than grapes, peanuts and navy beans, other crops commonly grown in the Kingaroy area are sorghum, wheat, maize, sunflowers, citrus fruits and duboisia, a kind of plant often used for pharmaceutical products.

Kingaroy is centred on one of Australia&#x27;s largest pork producing regions, and since the early 1960s has been home to one of Queensland&#x27;s largest pig abattoirs, Swickers Kingaroy Bacon Factory.

Hardwood Forestry Plantations have been prominent across the landscape since the early 2000s, having been established on many farms in the region as joint ventures between Landholders and the Queensland Government. The Plantation Forestry Industry is expected to provide employment for many locals in the future.

== Attractions ==
The Central Business District of the town is dominated by the Peanut Company of Australia&#x27;s peanut silos (a local landmark).

The Information, Art, and Heritage Precinct is located directly opposite the peanut silos. The complex includes 

* the Kingaroy Regional Art Gallery, 
* Visitor Information Centre, 
* Heritage Museum,
* interpretative arena which highlights local industries.
The Heritage Precinct includes
* Carroll&#x27;s Cottage (the first building constructed in Kingaroy)
* Carrollee Hotel 
* Shire&#x27;s earliest Council Chambers (built in 1913).
The Kilkivan to Kingaroy Rail Trail follows the old railway line between the two towns. It is long and passes through Goomeri, Murgon, Wondai, Tingoora, Wooroolin, Memerambi, and Crawford. The trail from Kilkivan to Murgon is unsealed. Queensland’s first and longest sealed rail trail section of from Murgon to Kingaroy is for walkers and cyclists only. Short distances between towns means coffee is never far away.

The town has two lookouts. 

* The narrow road to Mt Wooroolin Lookout is not suitable for vehicles towing caravans or trailers. The lookout provides 360 degree views, as well as a grassed area with picnic tables and wood barbecues. There is a loop trail for hikers and mountain bikers from Mt Wooroolin Lookout through the nature reserve of endangered eucalypt woodland and dry vine forest. Regent Bowerbirds, Black-breasted buttonquail and Eastern Shriketit can sometimes be sighted. 
* Apex Park and Lookout is adjacent to the Carrol Nature Reserve Kokoda Track (refer Amenities). The lookout is accessed by a walking track. Dollar birds, Indian Koel, Rufous whistler, Rufous fantail and the Eastern whipbird can sometimes be sighted.

The Kingaroy Observatory (formerly Maidenwell Observatory) was moved to its new site in Geoff Raph Drive at the airport in early March 2015 and opened for business on 29 June. Kingaroy Observatory is a major tourist attraction for those wanting to eyeball the Universe up close, in large powerful telescopes, under a canopy of stars not affected by light pollution.

The town is situated in the middle of some spectacular scenery, and is popular for bushwalking.

Several wineries are located either in or very close to the town, along with the Booie Range Distillery which opened in 2001 – only the third distillery in Queensland.

Kingaroy is the largest town in the South Burnett and the region&#x27;s commercial centre, offering all the services, shopping facilities and many of the industries generally expected in much larger centres. The town has its own hotels, motels, caravan parks, bed and breakfasts and cabins; and a range of restaurants, fast food outlets and petrol stations (including 24-hour petrol stations). Unlike many towns of its size, Kingaroy has its own shopping mall that includes Woolworths, Big W, and other retailers.

=== The Big Peanut ===
The Big Peanut is a monument located in Lions Park on the corner of Kingaroy Street and Baron Street. It is considered to be one of Australia&#x27;s big things. Constructed by scrap metal artist Kane Minogue using old farming machinery from local peanut farms, the 450 kilogram sculpture stands at 3.4 metres tall and has a width of 1.4 metres.

The Big Peanut was installed in Lions Park on 4 November 2021 and was officially unveiled at a community celebration on 2 April 2022 which was also held to recognise the Kingaroy Needs A Big Peanut committee, the sponsors and Minogue. The original mascot from the defunct Kingaroy Peanut Festival was also in attendance. Kingaroy&#x27;s Peanut Festival was an annual event held from 1959 until it was axed in 2011 following the Queensland floods due to a lack of community support.

Although the idea for such as landmark had regularly been suggested for at least thirty years prior, it wasn&#x27;t until 2017 when the concept for The Big Peanut garnered substantial support after a social media campaign was launched called &quot;Kingaroy Needs A Big Peanut&quot; which drew support from South Burnett Regional Council. Prior to the installation of The Big Peanut, the landmark was depicted in a 2020 episode of the ABC Kids program &quot;Bluey&quot;.

In March 2022, a 29-year-old man appeared in court on 15 charges including 12 counts of wilful damage by graffiti after he used spray paint to vandalise The Big Peanut and other local sites across Kingaroy between 3 January 2022 and 10 January 2022. He was ordered to pay restitution, complete 40 hours of unpaid graffiti removal work and also fined $250 for drug offences.

<text>The Manitoba Liberal Party, a political party in the Canadian province of Manitoba, has chosen most of its leaders by delegated leadership conventions. Since 1993, the Manitoba Liberal Party has chosen its leaders by an open vote of party members, weighted by riding.

The party&#x27;s first leader, Thomas Greenway, does not appear to have faced any formal opposition when he created the party in 1882/1883.

<text>Mark R. Lepper (born December 5, 1944) is the Albert Ray Lang Professor of psychology at Stanford University, and a leading theorist in social psychology. He is particularly known for his research on attribution theory and confirmation bias, and for his collaborations with Lee Ross.

==Life==
Lepper is primarily responsible for the elucidation of the overjustification effect, alongside Richard Nisbett.

With frequent collaborator Lee Ross, and Robert Vallone, he authored the first study to identify the hostile media effect. With Ross and Charles Lord he also authored an important study on attitude change and what is now called disconfirmation bias. With Lord he later theorized attitude representation theory. He has also worked with Thomas Gilovich and Merrill Carlsmith.

Lepper attended Stanford University as an undergraduate, earning a B.A. with great distinction in psychology in 1966. He subsequently earned a Ph.D. in Social and Developmental Psychology at Yale University in 1970, returning to Stanford in 1971 as an assistant professor. Lepper became a full professor of psychology and, by courtesy, of education in 1982, and has since served as chairman of the department of psychology between 1990 and 1994, and again after 2000. He is a fellow of the American Psychological Association and a charter fellow of the American Psychological Society.

<doc id="1138195" wikidata="Q955043" url="?curid=1138195" title="Meat-packing industry">
<text>The meat-packing industry (also spelled meatpacking industry or meat packing industry) handles the slaughtering, processing, packaging, and distribution of meat from animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep and other livestock. Poultry is generally not included. This greater part of the entire meat industry is primarily focused on producing meat for human consumption, but it also yields a variety of by-products including hides, dried blood, protein meals such as meat &amp; bone meal, and, through the process of rendering, fats (such as tallow).

In the United States and some other countries, the facility where the meat packing is done is called a &quot;slaughterhouse&quot;, &quot;packinghouse&quot; or a &quot;meat-packing plant&quot;; in New Zealand, where most of the products are exported, it is called a &quot;freezing works&quot;. An abattoir is a place where animals are slaughtered for food.
The meat-packing industry grew with the construction of railroads and methods of refrigeration for meat preservation. Railroads made possible the transport of stock to central points for processing, and the transport of products.

== History ==
=== United States ===
Before the American Civil War, the meat industry was localized, with farmers providing beef and hogs for nearby butchers to serve the local market. Large Army contracts during the Civil War attracted entrepreneurs with a vision for building much larger markets. The 1865–1873 era provided five factors that expanded the industry to a national scale:

* The rapid growth of cities provided a lucrative new market for fresh meat.
* The emergence of large-scale ranching, the role of the railroads, refrigeration, and entrepreneurial skills.
* Cattle ranching on a large-scale moved to the Great Plains, from Texas northward.
* Overland cattle drives moved large herds to the railheads in Kansas, where cattle cars brought live animals eastward.
* Abilene, Kansas, became the chief railhead, shipping 35,000 cattle a year, mostly to Kansas City, Milwaukee and Chicago.

In Milwaukee, Philip Armour, an ambitious entrepreneur from New York who made his fortune in Army contracts during the war, partnered with Jacob Plankinton to build a highly efficient stockyard that serviced the upper Midwest. Chicago built the famous Union Stockyards in 1865 on 345 swampy acres to the south of downtown. Armour opened the Chicago plant, as did Nelson Morris, another wartime contractor. Cincinnati and Buffalo, both with good water and rail service, also opened stockyards. Perhaps the most energetic entrepreneur was Gustavus Franklin Swift, the Yankee who operated out of Boston and moved to Chicago in 1875, specializing in long distance refrigerated meat shipments to eastern cities.

A practical refrigerated (ice-cooled) rail car was introduced in 1881. This made it possible to ship cattle and hog carcasses, which weighed only 40% as much as live animals; the entire national market, served by the railroads, was opened up, as well as transatlantic markets using refrigerated ships. Swift developed an integrated network of cattle procurement, slaughtering, meat-packing, and shipping meat to market. Up to that time, cattle were driven great distances to railroad shipping points, causing the cattle to lose considerable weight. Swift developed a large business, which grew in size with the entry of several competitors. The Bureau of Corporations, predecessor of the Federal Trade Commission investigated the country&#x27;s meatpackers for anti-competitive practices in the first decade of the 1900s.

The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was the first of a series of legislation that led to the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Another such act passed the same year was the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The new laws helped the large packers, and hurt small operations that lacked economy of scale or quality controls.

Historian William Cronon concludes:
:Because of the Chicago packers, ranchers in Wyoming and feedlot farmers in Iowa regularly found a reliable market for their animals, and on average received better prices for the animals they sold there. At the same time and for the same reason, Americans of all classes found a greater variety of more and better meats on their tables, purchased on average at lower prices than ever before. Seen in this light, the Packers&#x27; &quot;rigid system of economy&quot; seemed a very good thing indeed.

====Changing geography====
The industry after 1945 closed its stockyards in big cities like Chicago and moved operations to small towns close to cattle ranches, especially in Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado. Historically, besides Cincinnati, Chicago and Omaha, the other major meat-packing cities had been South St. Paul, Minnesota; East St. Louis, Illinois; Dubuque, Iowa; Kansas City, Missouri; Austin, Minnesota; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Sioux City, Iowa.
====Rail to truck====
Mid-century restructuring by the industry of the stockyards, slaughterhouses and meat-packing plants led to relocating facilities closer to cattle feedlots and swine production facilities, to more rural areas, as transportation shifted from rail to truck. It has been difficult for labor to organize in such locations. In addition, the number of jobs fell sharply due to technology and other changes. Wages fell during the latter part of the 20th century, and eventually, both Chicago (in 1971) and Omaha (in 1999) closed their stockyards. The workforce increasingly relied on recent migrants from Mexico.
====Argentina====
Argentina had the natural resources and human talent to build a world-class meat-packing industry. However, its success in reaching European markets was limited by the poor quality control in the production of its meat and the general inferiority of frozen meat to the chilled meat exported by the United States and Australia. By 1900, the Argentine government encouraged investment in the industry to improve quality. The British dominated the world shipping industry and began fitting their ships for cold air containers, and built new refrigerated steamers. When the Argentine industry finally secured a large slice of the British market, Pateros and trade restrictions limited its penetration of the Continent.

====China====
Meat in China moved from a minor specialty commodity to a major factor in the food supply in the late 20th century thanks to the rapid emergence of a middle class with upscale tastes and plenty of money. It was a transition from a country able to provide a small ration of meat for urban citizens only to the world&#x27;s largest meat producer; it was a movement from a handful of processing facilities in major cities to thousands of modern meat-packing and processing plants throughout the country, alongside the rapid growth of a middle-class with spending money.

==Labor and safety issues==
In the early 20th century, meatpacking companies employed new immigrants as strikebreakers during labor actions initiated by existing workers, who were often earlier immigrants themselves or the immediate descendants of immigrants. The publication of the Upton Sinclair novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; in the U.S. in 1906 shocked the public with the poor working conditions and unsanitary practices in the meat-packing plants in the United States, specifically Chicago.

Meat-packing plants, like many industries in the early 20th century, overworked their employees, failed to maintain adequate safety measures, and actively fought unionization. Meat-packing workers were exposed to dangerous chemicals and sharp machinery, and routinely suffered horrible injuries. Public pressure of the U.S. Congress led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act (both passed in 1906 on the same day) to ensure better regulations of the meat-packing industry. 

In the 1920s and early 1930s, workers achieved unionization under the CIO&#x27;s United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA). An interracial committee led the organizing in Chicago, where the majority of workers in the industry were black, and other major cities, such as Omaha, Nebraska, where they were an important minority in the industry. UPWA workers made important gains in wages, hours and benefits. In 1957, the stockyards and meat-packing plants employed half the workers of Omaha. The union supported a progressive agenda, including the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. While the work was still difficult, for a few decades workers achieved blue-collar, middle-class lives from it.

Though the meat-packing industry has made many improvements since the early 1900s, extensive changes in the industry since the late 20th century have caused new labor issues to arise. Today, the rate of injury in the meat-packing industry is three times that of the private industry overall, and meat-packing was noted by Human Rights Watch as being &quot;the most dangerous factory job in America&quot;. The meatpacking industry continues to employ many immigrant laborers, including some who are undocumented workers. In the early 20th century the workers were immigrants from eastern and southern Europe and black migrants from the South. Today, many meatpacking workers are Hispanics hailing from Mexico, Central and South America. A notable amount of workers are from Peru, leading to the formation of a large Peruvian community in the industry. The isolated areas in which many plants are located put these workers at greater risk due to their limited ability to organize and seek redress for work-related injuries.

American slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker. NPR reports that pig and cattle slaughterhouse workers are nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries than average. The Guardian reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the United States. On average, one employee of Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in America, is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that over a period of six years in the UK, 78 slaughter workers lost fingers, parts of fingers or limbs, more than 800 workers had serious injuries, and at least 4,500 had to take more than three days off after accidents. In a 2018 study in the Italian Journal of Food Safety, slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being killed. A 2004 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that &quot;excess risks were observed for mortality from all causes, all cancers, and lung cancer&quot; in workers employed in the New Zealand meat processing industry. 

The act of slaughtering animals or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter may engender psychological stress or trauma in the people involved. A 2016 study in &quot;Organization&quot; indicates, &quot;Regression analyses of data from 10,605 Danish workers across 44 occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well-being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior&quot;. A 2009 study by criminologist Amy Fitzgerald indicates, &quot;slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates, arrests for violent crimes, arrests for rape, and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries&quot;. As authors from the PTSD Journal explain, &quot;These employees are hired to kill animals, such as pigs and cows that are largely gentle creatures. Carrying out this action requires workers to disconnect from what they are doing and from the creature standing before them. This emotional dissonance can lead to consequences such as domestic violence, social withdrawal, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, and PTSD&quot;.
Slaughterhouses in the United States commonly illegally employ and exploit underage workers and illegal immigrants. In 2010, Human Rights Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the United States as a human rights crime. In a report by Oxfam America, slaughterhouse workers were observed not being allowed breaks, were often required to wear diapers, and were paid below minimum wage.

Another problem in this context is that the pharmaceutical industry obtains basic materials for its products from the meat-packing industry; for example, tissue extracts from slaughterhouse waste. In the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, this led to the paradoxical situation that mass slaughterhouses were infection drivers due to the bad labor conditions and at the same time suppliers of important therapeutics such as heparin, which subsequently became a scarce commodity. Medical historian Benjamin Prinz has therefore pointed to the fragility of today&#x27;s healthcare systems, which themselves participate in environmentally destructive and disease-causing production chains.

Contemporary concerns about the meat industry within the American context have often been colored by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the resulting supply chain issues. Beyond the consumer perspective, workers were expected to drastically increase the rate at which they process animals. For instance, workers were expected to process 175 birds per minute up from 140 birds per minute. In part this was due to shortages of workers. Workers within the industry were often in the news for large outbreaks within factories. By its nature meat processing requires close proximity to other workers and exposure to a slew of bacteria and viruses. Additionally, workers often have to yell over loud machinery which increases the amount of contaminated droplets in the air. More than 50,000 meat packing workers contracted the disease and over 200 died. Disease is not evenly distributed throughout factories and all workers in a given factory are not at equal risk for exposure and negative health outcomes despite working the same job. In particular, the overlap of immigration status and workplace exposures can result in a variety of negative health outcomes.

<text>Mestia ( ) is a highland townlet (&quot;daba&quot;) in northwest Georgia, at an elevation of in the Caucasus Mountains.

==General information==
Mestia is located in the region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti province (&quot;mkhare&quot;), some northeast of the regional capital of Zugdidi. Mestia and the adjoining 132 villages form Mestia District (&quot;raioni&quot;). Its area is ; and its population is 9,316 (1,973 in the town itself), according to the 2014 Georgia census. It was granted the status of a townlet (Georgian: &quot;daba&quot;) in 1968.

Historically and ethnographically, Mestia has always been regarded a chief community of Zemo, or Upper Svaneti province. It was formerly known as Seti (სეტი). The population is mostly Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of the Georgians. Despite its small size, the townlet was an important centre of Georgian culture for centuries and contains a number of medieval monuments, such as churches and forts, included in a list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Mestia is served by the Queen Tamar Airport, which is operated by the state-owned company &quot;United Airports of Georgia&quot; since 2010.
==Architecture and attractions==
The townlet is dominated by stone defensive towers of a type seen in Ushguli and Mestia proper (&quot;Svan towers&quot;). A typical Svan fortified dwelling consisted of a tower, an adjacent house (&quot;machubi&quot;) and some other household structures encircled by a defensive wall.

Unique icons and manuscripts are kept in Mestia Historical-Ethnographic Museum. Mestia is also a centre of mountaineering tourism.

The town is the starting point for the popular Mestia-Ushguli trail. Most hikers complete this route in four days, sleeping in guesthouses or in local farmhouses.

<text>Michael Richard Sexton (September 22, 1947September 6, 2020) was an American professional poker player and commentator. He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Early years==
Sexton was a gymnast and attended Ohio State University, where he earned a degree in public recreation after changing majors from business. He joked that he majored in poker because he played very frequently in college. He also regularly played contract bridge and taught classes on it in North Carolina.

Sexton joined the U.S. Army as a paratrooper assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division in 1970. The division had just returned from Vietnam and Sexton never saw combat. While he was in the army, he taught ballroom dancing, and one of his clients convinced him to try being a salesman, which he continued to do after his two-year enlistment was up. After a while, he realized that he could make more money playing poker than being a salesman, so he took up poker in 1977.

In 1985 he moved to Nevada to pursue poker full-time. Sexton was a well-known cohort of poker player Stu Ungar, and was a pallbearer and speaker at Ungar&#x27;s funeral.

==Poker player and promoter==
=== World Poker Tour ===
On the World Poker Tour (WPT), Sexton had seventeen career cashes in WPT tournaments, including four final tables. In November 2016, Sexton won the WPT Montreal Main Event, besting a field of 648 entries to win the US$317,896 first prize, on a buy-in of CAD$3,850 per player. It was his third time reaching a WPT final table and his first WPT victory. At the time of his death, his career WPT earnings were $1,011,725, ranking him 233rd in WPT earnings, as well as holding 64th place for 4 WPT final table appearances.

Sexton also served as the lead commentator on WPT telecasts, working alongside Vince Van Patten for the program&#x27;s first fifteen seasons.

=== World Series of Poker ===
Sexton won several tournaments, including one World Series of Poker bracelet, and almost $5,700,000 in total WSOP tournament winnings. He won his bracelet in the $1,500 seven-card stud split event at the 1989 World Series of Poker. His 72 cashes at the WSOP account for $2.6 million of his total winnings. Sexton finished 10th in a preliminary event at the 2005 World Series of Poker and also in the final 16 of Poker Superstars II. On June 27, 2006, Sexton won the third annual World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions event, and along with it the $1,000,000 first prize. In the final hand, his defeated Daniel Negreanu&#x27;s on a board of . In July 2012, Sexton finished in 9th place in the &quot;Big One for One Drop&quot; WSOP event, earning him $1,109,333, the biggest cash of his career. During his final World Series of Poker in 2019, Sexton partnered with James Holzhauer, a famed game show contestant and sports gambler making his first World Series of Poker appearance.

=== Commentator and promoter ===
A former commentator of the World Poker Tour, alongside Vince Van Patten, he wrote articles for &quot;Card Player Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Gambling Times&quot;. He founded the now-defunct &quot;Tournament of Champions of Poker&quot;, which only let tournament winners from the previous year compete.

=== PartyPoker ===
Sexton co-founded and was the chairman for PartyPoker.com, at one time the biggest online poker site in the United States, despite the company being under a $500K deficit after its first launch in 2002. Four years after launch, the company went public for $9 billion, but Sexton sold out his shares for $15 million a year and a half prior to the public offering. When addressing this, Sexton said he did not regret his decision, even though selling when he did cost him an estimated $500 million.

=== PokerNewsDaily ===
Over the course of his career, Sexton was closely associated with many legendary figures in poker. He expressed admiration for the late &quot;Stu Ungar&quot;, stating in an interview with &quot;Poker News Daily&quot; that if Ungar were still alive, he would have been &quot;far and away the top superstar in the poker world and the greatest star on the &quot;World Poker Tour&quot;.&quot; He gave several interviews on the news portal. 

Sexton&#x27;s impact on poker extended beyond his achievements as a player and commentator. He was widely regarded as one of the game&#x27;s most influential figures, helping to shape modern poker through his work with both the &quot;WPT&quot; and &quot;PartyPoker&quot;.

=== Style ===
Sexton played a solid overall game; being one of the first to implement preflop steals meaning to raise with a worse hand with the intention of winning the blinds and antes. This means you can win a healthy pot without the risk of losing a large proportion of your stack. 

== Charity ==
Sexton donated half of his post-tax winnings from his win in 2006 of the third annual World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions event, a prize of $1,000,000, to five charities. He pledged to do the same with all future winnings. In early 2009, Sexton along with Linda Johnson, Jan Fisher and Lisa Tenner, created PokerGives.org, a nonprofit organization that offers poker players an easier way to give to charity.

== Honors, awards, distinctions ==
Sexton was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2009. For all of his work promoting poker, Sexton was often known as &quot;the ambassador of poker&quot;. On February 15, 2006, Sexton was recognized as the top poker ambassador at the &quot;Card Player Magazine&quot; Player of the Year Awards Gala.

On July 21, 2020, the WPT Champions Cup was renamed to the Mike Sexton WPT Champions Cup.

== Death ==
Sexton died on September 6, 2020, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.

<text>Michael Vernon (born February 24, 1963) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Calgary Flames, Detroit Red Wings, San Jose Sharks and Florida Panthers.

A winner of over 300 NHL games, he is a two-time Stanley Cup champion, with the Flames in 1989 and the Red Wings in 1997. He appeared in five NHL All-Star Games, was named a second team All-Star in 1989, shared the William M. Jennings Trophy in 1996 with Chris Osgood, and was named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the 1997 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Vernon was a standout goaltender in junior for the Calgary Wranglers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He was named both goaltender of the year and most valuable player in 1982 and 1983. He was loaned to the Portland Winterhawks for the 1983 Memorial Cup and was named the top goaltender of the tournament in leading Portland to the championship.

Selected by the Flames in the third round, 56th overall, in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, Vernon began his professional career in 1982 and ended it 20 years later, also in Calgary. The Flames retired his number 30 in 2007 and he was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2010. Vernon has been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2023. Vernon represented Canada internationally on two occasions, winning a bronze medal at the 1983 World Junior Championship and silver at the 1991 World Championship.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Vernon began playing hockey at South Calgary Community Association outdoor rinks as a goaltender at the age of six. A native of Calgary, Vernon played his junior hockey in his hometown. First for the Calgary Canucks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League in 1979–80, and then the Calgary Wranglers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He appeared in 59 games in his first WHL season, 1980–81, posting a 33–17–1 record before leading the team to the WHL finals where the Wranglers lost the best-of-seven championship to the Victoria Cougars, four games to three. He attracted the attention of the Calgary Flames, who selected him with their third round pick, 56th overall, at the 1981 NHL Entry Draft.

Vernon returned to the Wranglers for the 1981–82 season where he posted a 22–14–3 record with three shutouts. He was named a WHL all-star at goal, and was the recipient of the WHL Top Goaltender Award and named WHL most valuable player. Though the Wranglers were eliminated in the playoffs, junior rules of the time allowed the league champion to add an extra goaltender on loan for the Memorial Cup tournament. Vernon accepted an invitation to join the Portland Winter Hawks for the 1983 tournament where the team finished third in the three team event (all teams had two wins and two losses). Vernon made his professional debut following the tournament, appearing in one playoff game for the Central Hockey League&#x27;s Oklahoma City Stars.

Vernon spent a third season with the Wranglers in 1982–83, however injuries during the season to Reggie Lemelin and Don Edwards forced the Flames to recall him to the NHL. Vernon made his NHL debut on December 12, 1982, against the Detroit Red Wings. A poor effort by the Flames resulted in Vernon surrendering six goals in the first two periods before being pulled in a 7–3 loss. Vernon appeared in one additional game, also a loss, before returning to the WHL where he repeated as the WHL&#x27;s top goaltender and most valuable player. Vernon also played with the Canadian team at the 1982 World Junior Championship, winning two games in three appearances and helping Canada win the bronze medal.

Vernon again joined the Winter Hawks, for the 1983 Memorial Cup, but not without controversy. The WHL champion Lethbridge Broncos first requested he join their team for the tournament, but he was unwilling to play under the team&#x27;s coach and refused. The Broncos were upset by Vernon&#x27;s refusal, calling it &quot;garbage&quot; that he was allowed to join the rival Winter Hawks, who were hosting the tournament, after turning them down. Winning all three games he started, Vernon led Portland to the championship. He was named recipient of the Hap Emms Memorial Trophy as the most valuable goaltender of the tournament while the Winter Hawks became the first American team to win the Memorial Cup.

===Calgary Flames===
Turning professional in 1982–83, Vernon spent most of the season with the CHL&#x27;s Colorado Flames where he was named to the league&#x27;s second all-star team after posting a 30–13–2 record in 46 games. He returned to the Flames in 1983-84 but had a loss so he returned to the CHL. Considered at that point to be Calgary&#x27;s goaltender of the future, he moved up to the Moncton Golden Flames of the American Hockey League (AHL) for 1984–85. The season was a disappointment for Vernon as he struggled throughout the year. He won only 10 of 41 starts and posted a goals against average (GAA) of 3.94. Vernon began the 1985–86 season as the fourth goaltender on the Flames&#x27; depth chart behind Lemelin, Marc D&#x27;Amour and Rick Kosti. He split the first half of the season between Moncton in the AHL and the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the International Hockey League (IHL).

In the midst of what was ultimately a franchise record losing streak, wishing to rest Lemelin and facing a minor injury to backup Marc D&#x27;Amour, the Flames brought Vernon up to play an exhibition game against Soviet club Dynamo Moscow during the 1986 Super Series. Vernon was outstanding in goal, leading the Flames to a 4–3 victory. Following a 9–1 loss to the Hartford Whalers that was Calgary&#x27;s 11th consecutive defeat, Vernon was given his first regular season start on January 9, 1986, against the Vancouver Canucks. He led the team to a 5–4 overtime victory to end the streak. It was also Vernon&#x27;s first NHL win. He recorded his first career shutout, also against Vancouver, on February 26 in a 4–0 win during a stretch where Vernon went two months without losing in which he started.

Three of Vernon&#x27;s nine regular season wins came against the Winnipeg Jets, Calgary&#x27;s first round opponent in the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs. Though he had only 21-games of NHL experience, Vernon was named the starter for the series. He led the Flames to a three-game sweep of Winnipeg, followed by seven-game series victories over the Oilers and St. Louis Blues to lead the Flames into the Stanley Cup Finals where the Flames ultimately fell to the Montreal Canadiens and their rookie goaltender Patrick Roy in five games.

Vernon solidified his position as the Flames&#x27; starting goaltender in 1986–87, finishing third in the NHL with 30 wins. His 39 wins the following season was second in the league, one behind Grant Fuhr. He played in the 1988 All-Star Game, his first of four consecutive appearances in the event, and helped the Flames win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top team in the regular season. The Flames were upset by the Oilers in the playoffs, however.

The 1988–89 season was one of Vernon&#x27;s finest. He led all NHL goaltenders in wins with 37 and was second with a 2.65 GAA. He was named to the second All-Star team and helped Calgary post the best record in the League. He finished second to Roy in voting for the Vezina Trophy as the league&#x27;s top goaltender. The Flames entered the 1989 playoffs as heavy favourites to defeat Vancouver in the opening round, but the Canucks forced Calgary to a seventh and deciding game in the series. The game went to overtime, during which Vernon was forced to make a spectacular glove save on a Stan Smyl breakaway. That save came to be a defining moment of Vernon&#x27;s career, and was later called &quot;the save that won the Cup&quot;. The Flames defeated Vancouver when Joel Otto scored the winner, then went on to defeat the Los Angeles Kings, Chicago Blackhawks and Montreal Canadiens to win Calgary&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship.

Vernon remained among the NHL leaders in wins the following seasons, finishing sixth in 1989–90 with 23 and second in 1990–91 with 31. He was voted to the starting lineup for both the 1990 and 1991 All-Star Games via fan balloting. He served as the backup goaltender for Team Canada at the 1991 World Championship, and though he lost both games he appeared in, Vernon and the Canadians won the silver medal. Despite his success with the Flames, Vernon was often criticized for letting in weak goals, and was routinely booed by the fans in Calgary when he did so. Some fans chose to direct insults towards his family in the stands, causing his parents to stop attending games. Discussing his relationship with Flames fans later in his career, Vernon said, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to have a pretty thick skin to play goal. Fans at hockey games get very emotional. They&#x27;re very passionate. They don&#x27;t enjoy watching their team give up goals.&quot;

Vernon also battled through recurring back problems that occasionally forced him out of the lineup. Playing through it all, Vernon became the 38th goaltender in league history to win 200 games, reaching the milestone on November 14, 1992, against the Tampa Bay Lightning. He played in his fifth All-Star Game in 1992–93, and was named to play his sixth the following season but had to withdraw due to a knee injury. After nearly ten seasons with Vernon as Calgary&#x27;s starting goaltender, the Flames felt it was time to hand the starting goaltender duties to Trevor Kidd. On June 29, 1994, they traded Vernon to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for defenceman Steve Chiasson. The Red Wings had been pursuing a deal for Vernon since the previous season.

===Detroit Red Wings===
Detroit anticipated the veteran Vernon would help develop their young goaltender Chris Osgood. As Detroit&#x27;s top goaltender in 1994–95, Vernon posted a 19–6–4 record and helped the Red Wings win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. The Red Wings reached the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals – their first appearance in the championship series since 1966 – but were swept in four games by the New Jersey Devils. Vernon and the Red Wings struggled to agree on a new contract following the season. Their dispute went to arbitration after Vernon and his agent accepted an offer of a two-year, US$5.45 million contract that the team claimed to have withdrawn. The arbitrator sided with the Red Wings, making Vernon an unrestricted free agent. The two sides ultimately agreed on a two-year contract, of which the financial terms were not released.

While Osgood began to establish his position as the Red Wings&#x27; starter in 1995–96, Vernon won 21 games against only 7 regulation losses as the Red Wings set an NHL record with 62 victories in the regular season. Vernon and Osgood shared the William M. Jennings Trophy as the goaltending duo on the team with the fewest goals against. Vernon was the backup goaltender to Osgood during the 1996–97 season, but became the 13th player in NHL history to win 300 games. He reached the milestone on March 26, 1997, against the Colorado Avalanche in a game in which he also fought Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy.

Head coach Scotty Bowman turned to the veteran Vernon as the team&#x27;s starter in the 1997 playoffs after Osgood struggled late in the regular season. He recorded a 16–4 record with a 1.76 GAA in the post-season, and was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the most valuable player of the playoffs as Detroit won its first Stanley Cup championship in 42 years. Placed in a position where the Red Wings had to trade a goaltender due to the waiver draft, Detroit chose to trade Vernon to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for two draft picks on August 18, 1997.

===San Jose Sharks===

With the Sharks, Vernon formed a tandem with veteran Kelly Hrudey and delivered a solid performance for the team. Vernon played two full seasons with the Sharks, winning 30 games in 1997–98 and leading the team to the playoffs in both 1998 and 1999. However, in his second season, Vernon became expendable thanks to the play of Steve Shields and the need to make a spot for rookie Evgeni Nabokov. On December 30, 1999, Vernon was traded to the Florida Panthers (along with a draft pick) in exchange for Radek Dvořák. Vernon, who was quite content with the Sharks, was caught off guard by the trade: “(Head Coach Darryl Sutter) told me to get ready to play the second half of the season. I was well rested and ready to play,” Vernon said. “I was completely thrown for a loop because I felt like we finally had all the pieces to challenge for the Stanley Cup. I was very disappointed.”
===Florida Panthers===

The opening for Vernon in Miami was created when goaltender Trevor Kidd dislocated his shoulder a couple of weeks before the trade. Vernon appeared in 34 games with the Panthers, winning 18, and led them to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. Despite his success, when it came time for the Panthers to protect a goaltender in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray went with Trevor Kidd, who was ten years younger than Vernon. Much like he had in Calgary years before, Trevor Kidd pushed Vernon out of the picture. Vernon was claimed by the Minnesota Wild but was immediately traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Dan Cavanaugh and an eighth round selection in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. Vernon, who left Calgary on acrimonious terms six years before, was shocked to hear he was returning to the Flames. &quot;Oh my God, you&#x27;re joking,&quot; Vernon said. &quot;I&#x27;m going where? You have got to be kidding me.&quot;

===Return to Calgary===

Returning to the franchise he began his career with, the 37-year-old Vernon was expected to split goaltending duties with Fred Brathwaite. He played in 41 games in 2000–01, winning 12 games, losing 23 and posting a 3.23 GAA. He appeared in 18 games in 2001–02, and though his GAA improved to 2.76, he won only two. Vernon left the game following the season, announcing his retirement on September 13, 2002. He retired seventh all-time in regular season wins with 385, fourth among goalies in playoff appearances at 138 and fifth in playoff wins with 77. He played in four Stanley Cup Finals, winning two Stanley Cups.

Vernon held virtually every Flames franchise goaltending record upon his retirement. His regular season records—games played (526), wins (262) and minutes played (29,650)—were all subsequently broken by Miikka Kiprusoff, but he remains the team leader in playoff games played (81) and wins (43). The Flames honoured Vernon on February 6, 2007, retiring his #30 jersey. He was the second player in franchise history to have his number retired, after Lanny McDonald. Vernon was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2010. Vernon returned to the ice 2011 to play in the alumni game at the Heritage Classic outdoor game.

Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender Glenn Hall considered Vernon one of the best goaltenders of his era: &quot;I always thought Grant Fuhr was the best goalie of his time. But I always thought Vernie was very close.&quot; Vernon said that playing against the likes of Fuhr and Patrick Roy led him to improve at his position. He was a stand-up goaltender early in his career, but learned to adopt aspects of the butterfly style after watching them play. Standing only tall, he relied on speed and reflexes to be a successful goaltender in the NHL.

==Personal life==
Vernon was born February 24, 1963, in Calgary. His father Martin worked in construction and was president of the South Calgary community hockey organization where young Mike played his youth hockey. Vernon attended Central Memorial High School and Henry Wise Wood Senior High School. He was always a goaltender, often joining his father for practices by age four and always focusing on the goaltenders. He considered his mother Lorraine his first coach and claimed his introduction to goaltending came from his family: &quot;I had three brothers and when it came time to play hockey, they always said the same thing: &#x27;Get Mikey, he&#x27;ll play net.&#x27;&quot;

Vernon and his wife Jane were married three days after his 1994 trade to Detroit. The couple have four children: daughter Amelia and three sons, Matthew, John and William. Matthew is currently a goalie with the Jacksonville Icemen of the East Coast Hockey League. The couple live in Calgary, but maintain a home in Invermere, British Columbia. Following his hockey career, Vernon has become involved in real estate development in the Windermere region near Invermere. He was also an investor in the Bear Mountain resort near Victoria, British Columbia.

<doc id="1138202" wikidata="Q6942147" url="?curid=1138202" title="Music of Lesotho">
<text>Lesotho is a Southern African nation surrounded entirely by South Africa. The largest ethnic group is the Basotho. The Basotho culture is immersed in musical traditions.

==National anthem==
The national anthem of Lesotho is &quot;Lesotho Fatse La Bontata Rona&quot;. Written by François Coillard, a French missionary, it appears in the popular computer game &quot;Sims 2: University&quot; as the theme from a videogame console for the minigame &quot;A-maz-ing Matey.&quot;

==Traditional instruments==

Traditional musical instruments include lekolulo, a kind of flute played by herding boys; setolo-tolo, resembling an extended jaw harp played by men using their mouth; and the women&#x27;s stringed thomo. More recently the &quot;mamokhorong&quot;, sometimes known as the &quot;sekhankula&quot;, has also become popular.

==Church music==
Vocal choirs, which sing church music in Sesotho, are extremely popular. These choirs are formed in 
villages, towns, churches, etc., and can be heard on the radio every evening.
The Gospel music of Lesotho is support by artists like justice Mofoleng and Joey Mofoleng his young brother. Lesotho gospel musicians are using their music to evangelize and support the brokenhearted.

==Popular music==
As an enclave of South Africa, it is not surprising that South African musicians have a large following in Lesotho. Most frequently heard on the radio are various sub-Saharan AfroPop styles, Sotho Hip-hop, RnB, Deep house, Soulful House, Dancehall, Jazz, kwaito, and reggae.

While South African music is generally enjoyed in Lesotho, there is a tremendous following for &quot;famo&quot; (contemporary Sesotho music, which features the accordion and oil can drum) such as that by Mosotho Chakela. The music recording industry is nascent, but many of the Basotho musicians sign with South African companies - undermining growth prospects. 
Malome Vector, Ntate Stunna, Taiylor Manson and Juvy are well known musicians in the South African music Industry. Malome Vector is signed under a well known recording label &#x27;Ambitiouz Entertainment&#x27;.

==Music festival==
*The Morija Arts &amp; Cultural Festival is a prominent Sotho music festival, held annually, which highlights the dance and music of the Basotho people.

==Famous BaSotho musicians==
* Joshua Pulumo Mohapeloa
* Mosotho Chakela
* Wiseman Molefe

They have a total of about 30,000 speakers (22,100 native). Most Nicobarese speakers speak the Car language. Paul Sidwell (2015:179) considers the Nicobarese languages to subgroup with Aslian.

The Nicobarese languages appear to be related to the Shompen language of the indigenous inhabitants of the interior of Great Nicobar Island (Blench &amp; Sidwell 2011), which is usually considered a separate branch of Austroasiatic. However, Paul Sidwell (2017) classifies Shompen as a Southern Nicobaric language rather than as a separate branch of Austroasiatic.

The morphological similarities between Nicobarese and Austronesian languages have been used as evidence for the Austric hypothesis (Reid 1994).

==Languages==
From north to south, the Nicobaric languages are:
*Car: Car (Pū)
*Chaura–Teressa: Chaura (Tutet/Sanënyö), Teressa (Taih-Long/Lurö)
*Central: Nancowry (Nang-kauri/Mūöt), Camorta, Katchal (Tehnu)
*Southern: Southern Nicobarese (Sambelong), Shompen (Shom Peng)

==Classification==
Paul Sidwell (2017) classifies the Nicobaric languages as follows.
*Nicobaric
**Car
**Chaura–Teressa
***Teressa, Chaura
**Central-Southern
***Central: Nancowry, Camorta, Katchall 
***Southern: Southern Nicobarese, Shompen

<text>Noroc is a music group from Moldova, created in 1967 by Mihai Dolgan.

==History==
&quot;Noroc&quot; became very popular in the USSR after the release of their first album in 1968 which included the following songs:
* &quot;De ce plâng chitarele&quot; (music: Mihai Dolgan; lyrics: Efim Crimerman)
* &quot;Cântă un artist&quot; (music: Mihai Dolgan; lyrics: Efim Crimerman)

In 1970, &quot;Noroc&quot; won the &quot;public sympathy&quot; prize at the &quot;Bratislava Lyra&quot; festival
. Later the same year, after a tour of Ukraine, &quot;Noroc&quot; was banned as a result of a direct order by Ivan Bodiul, Chief Secretary of the Communist Party of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, due to &quot;lack of discipline&quot;, &quot;promotion of artistic values of poor quality&quot;, and &quot;lack of healthy ideological orientation&quot;. Between the years 1974-1985 the band was reorganized by Mihai Dolgan under the name &quot;Contemporanul&quot;. After 1985, &quot;Contemporanul&quot; reverted to the original name &quot;Noroc&quot;. Since 1989 and up to Mihai Dolgan&#x27;s death in 2008, &quot;Noroc&quot;&#x27;s permanent vocalists were: Lidia Botezatu, Radu Dolgan, Mihai Dolgan.

The word &quot;noroc&quot; means &quot;good luck&quot; in the Moldovan language. This word is also used as a greeting. &quot;Noroc&quot; is also said while toasting (the Moldovan equivalent of &quot;cheers&quot;).

<doc id="1138207" wikidata="Q1136810" url="?curid=1138207" title="Center for Science and Culture">
<text>The Center for Science and Culture (CSC), formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC), is part of the Discovery Institute (DI), a conservative Christian think tank in the United States. The CSC lobbies for the inclusion of creationism in the form of intelligent design (ID) in public-school science curricula as an explanation for the origins of life and the universe while trying to cast doubt on the theory of evolution. These positions have been rejected by many in the scientific community, which identifies intelligent design as pseudoscientific neo-creationism, whereas the theory of evolution is the accepted scientific consensus.

The Center for Science and Culture serves as the hub of the intelligent design movement. Nearly all of prominent proponents of intelligent design are either CSC advisors, officers, or fellows. Stephen C. Meyer, a former vice president of the Discovery Institute and founder of the CSC, serves as a Senior Fellow, and Phillip E. Johnson was the Program Advisor. Johnson is commonly presented as the movement&#x27;s &quot;father&quot; and architect of the center&#x27;s Wedge strategy and &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; campaign, as well as the Santorum Amendment.

==History==
In 1987, the US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; against creation science being taught in United States public school science classes. In reaction, the term &quot;intelligent design&quot; was coined as a substitute in drafts of the textbook &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;, which was published in 1989, beginning the campaigning of the intelligent design movement under the leadership of &quot;Pandas&quot; editor Charles Thaxton. The &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; ruling also inspired Phillip E. Johnson to begin anti-evolution campaigning. He met Stephen C. Meyer, and through him was introduced to others who were developing what became the Wedge strategy, including Michael Denton, Michael Behe and William A. Dembski, with Johnson becoming the de facto leader of the group. By 1995, Johnson was opposing the methodological naturalism of science in which &quot;The Creator belongs to the realm of religion, not scientific investigation&quot;, and promoting &quot;theistic realism&quot; which &quot;assumes that the universe and all its creatures were brought into existence for a purpose by God&quot; and expects &quot;this &#x27;fact&#x27; of creation to have empirical, observable consequences.&quot;

In December 1993, Bruce Chapman, president and founder of the Discovery Institute, noticed an essay in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; by Meyer about a dispute when biology lecturer Dean H. Kenyon taught intelligent design creationism in introductory classes. Kenyon had co-authored &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;, and in 1993 Meyer had contributed to the teacher&#x27;s notes for the second edition of &quot;Pandas&quot;. Meyer was an old friend of Discovery Institute co-founder George Gilder, and over dinner about a year later they formed the idea of a think tank opposed to materialism. In mid-1995, Chapman and Meyer met a representative of Howard Ahmanson, Jr. Meyer, who had previously tutored Ahmanson&#x27;s son in science, recalls being asked &quot;What could you do if you had some financial backing?&quot;

The Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, as it was originally named, grew out of a conference called &quot;The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture&quot; that the Discovery Institute organised in mid-1995. It was founded in 1996 by the Discovery Institute with funding provided by Fieldstead &amp; Company, the Stewardship Foundation, Howard Ahmanson, Jr. and the Maclellan Foundation. The evolution of the center&#x27;s name in 2002 reflects its attempt to present itself as less religiously motivated in the public&#x27;s eye. The evolving banners on the CRSC/CSC&#x27;s website pictorially parallel these verbal efforts to disassociate the site from its overtly religious origins. The &quot;renewal&quot; in its name referred to its stated goal of &quot;renewing&quot; American culture by grounding society&#x27;s major institutions, especially education, in religion as outlined in the Wedge Document.

==CSC&#x27;s Wedge strategy==

An internal CSC report dating from 1998 which outlined a five-year plan for fostering broader acceptance of ID was leaked to the public in 1999. This plan became known as the Wedge strategy. The Wedge Document explained the CSC&#x27;s key aims are &quot;To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies&quot; and to &quot;replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.&quot;

The document sets as &quot;Five-Year Goals&quot; &quot;To see intelligent design theory as an accepted &quot;alternative&quot; in the sciences and scientific research being done from the perspective of design theory&quot; and notably &quot;To see major new debates in education, life issues, legal and personal responsibility pushed to the front of the national agenda.&quot; This was seen in the following years, with public debates over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms taking place in many states as part of the Teach the Controversy campaign.

If the CSC&#x27;s strategy is successful, within twenty years the goals are &quot;To see intelligent design theory as the &quot;dominant&quot; perspective in science.&quot; and &quot;To see design theory permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life.&quot; The CSC has responded to controversy regarding the Wedge Document, saying &quot;Conspiracy theorists in the media continue to recycle the urban legend of the &#x27;Wedge&#x27; document...&quot;

==CSC campaigns==

===Teach the Controversy===

The CSC&#x27;s Teach the Controversy campaign seeks to promote the teaching of &quot;the full range of scientific views&quot; on evolution on &quot;unresolved issues&quot; and the &quot;scientific weaknesses of evolutionary theory.&quot; Critics of the CSC&#x27;s campaign say that they have manufactured the controversy and that they promote the false perception that evolution is &quot;in crisis&quot; and is a &quot;dying theory.&quot;

The strategy has been to move from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, all the while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and methodological naturalism in science. The CSC is the primary organizer and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign. Examples of Teach the Controversy in action were the Kansas evolution hearings, the Santorum Amendment, 2002 Ohio Board of Education intelligent design controversy, and the Dover Area School District intelligent design controversy.

The CSC believe that the program and curricula they advocate presents evidence both for and against evolution and then encourages students to evaluate the arguments themselves. Casting the conflicting points of view and agendas as an academic and scholarly controversy was proposed by Phillip E. Johnson of the Discovery Institute in his book &quot;The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism&quot; (2000). In his book, he writes of the 1999–2000 Kansas evolution hearings controversy over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms: &quot;What educators in Kansas and elsewhere should be doing is to &#x27;teach the controversy.&#x27;&quot;

In its early years, the CSC (then called the CRSC) offered science curriculum that assured teachers that its &quot;Web curriculum can be appropriated without textbook adoption wars.&quot; This had the net effect of encouraging ID sympathetic teachers to side-step standard textbook adoption procedures. Anticipating a test case, Discovery Institute director Stephen C. Meyer along with David K. DeWolf and Mark Edward DeForrest published in the &quot;Utah Law Review&quot; a legal strategy for winning judicial sanction.

According to published reports, the nonprofit Discovery Institute spends more than $1 million USD a year for research, polls, lobbying and media pieces that support intelligent design and their Teach the Controversy strategy. In August 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that since 2004 there have been 78 campaigns in 31 states to either Teach the Controversy or include intelligent design in science curricula, twice the number seen in 2002–2003.

===Intelligent design in higher education===
The cultivation of support for ID and its social and political agenda in higher education is a very active part of CSC&#x27;s strategy. The CSC has claimed that established scholars in the scientific community support intelligent design.

CSC-recommended curricula benefits from special status at number of religious schools. Biola University and Oklahoma Baptist University are listed on the Access Research Network website as &quot;ID Colleges.&quot; In addition, the Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center (IDEA), which began as a student organization at the University of California, San Diego, helps establish student IDEA clubs on university and high school campuses. The Intelligent Design and Undergraduate Research Center, ARN&#x27;s student division, also recruits and supports followers at universities. Campus youth ministries play an active role in bringing ID to university campuses through lectures by ID leaders Phillip E. Johnson, William A. Dembski, Jonathan Wells, Michael Behe, and others. This activity takes place outside university science departments.

Several public universities, including the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of New Mexico have had intelligent design often as freshman seminars, honors courses, and other courses outside required curricula in which instructors have wider latitude regarding course content.

===Research fellowships===
The CSC offers fellowships of up to $60,000 a year for &quot;support of significant and original research in the natural sciences, the history and philosophy of science, cognitive science and related fields.&quot; Published reports state that the CSC has awarded $3.6 million in fellowships of $5,000 to $60,000 per year to 50 researchers since its founding in 1996.

Among the center&#x27;s publications are 50 books on intelligent design, such as those by William A. Dembski, and two documentary films, &quot;Unlocking the Mystery of Life&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Privileged Planet&quot; (2004), the later based on the book of the same name written by senior fellows Jay W. Richards and Guillermo Gonzalez.

Since its founding in 1996, the CSC has spent 39 percent of its $9.3 million on research according to Meyer, underwriting books or papers, or often just paying universities to release professors from some teaching responsibilities so that they can ponder intelligent design. Over those nine years, $792,585 was spent to finance laboratory or field research in biology, paleontology, or biophysics, while $93,828 was spent to help graduate students in paleontology, linguistics, history, and philosophy.

The results of this are found in Discovery Institute-authored science class curricula, &quot;model lesson plans&quot;, which are at the center of many of the current debates about including intelligent design in public school science classes. CSC promotes these, urging states and school boards to include criticism of evolution science lessons, and to &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot;, rather than actually teach intelligent design which is susceptible to legal challenges on First Amendment grounds.

==&quot;Evolution News &amp; Science Today&quot;==
CSC publishes the blog &quot;Evolution News &amp; Science Today&quot; (formerly &quot;Evolution News &amp; Views&quot;), which is often shortened to &quot;Evolution News&quot; (EN).

==Controversies==
In May 2005, the Discovery Institute donated $16,000 to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and by museum policy, this minimum donation allowed them to celebrate their donation inside the museum in a gathering. The Discovery Institute decided to screen &quot;The Privileged Planet&quot;. The video was also a production of Illustra Media, which has been identified as a front for a creationist production company. Upon further review, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History determined that the content of the video was inconsistent with the scientific research of the institution. As a result, they refunded the $16,000, clearly denied any endorsement of the content of the video or of the Discovery Institute, and allowed the film to be shown in the museum as per the original agreement. Editorials have decried as naïve and negligent the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History&#x27;s failure to identify the Discovery Institute as a creationist organization, exclude the video with its review process in the first place, and identify the entire incident as an example of Wedge strategy in action.

The center also funded research for the controversial book &quot;From Darwin to Hitler&quot; (2004) by Center fellow Richard Weikart. Weikart claims that Darwinism&#x27;s impact on ethics and morality played a key role not only in the rise of eugenics, but also in euthanasia, infanticide, abortion, and racial extermination, all ultimately embraced by the Nazis.

On September 6, 2006, on the center&#x27;s &quot;Evolution News &amp; Views&quot; blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post titled &quot;Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries&quot;. In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that English Wikipedia&#x27;s coverage of ID to be &quot;one sided&quot; and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published an English Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers &quot;to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design&quot;.

==Criticism==
Most criticism of the CSC and the Discovery Institute is that the institute intentionally misrepresents many facts in the promoting of its agenda. A wide spectrum of critics level this charge: from educators, scientists, and the Smithsonian Institution to individuals who oppose the teaching of creationism alongside science on ideological grounds. The following are the most common areas in which the institute is accused of intentionally misleading:
*Teach the Controversy Mainstream scientific organizations maintain that there is no controversy to teach, in the sense that the theory of evolution is fully accepted by the scientific community. Such controversies that do exist concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the overarching theory of evolution, and the controversy alleged by the Discovery Institute is manufactured.
*Santorum Amendment Despite the amendment lacking the weight of law, consistent with the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Wedge strategy, the amendment&#x27;s inclusion in the conference report of the No Child Left Behind Act is constantly cited by the Discovery Institute as evidence that &quot;federal education policy&quot; calls for a &quot;teach the controversy approach.&quot;
*Wedge strategy and the Discovery Institute agenda A common allegation often leveled at the CSC by critics is that it is conducting a campaign, the ultimate goal of which is to reshape American culture by influencing public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. The Wedge Document bolsters this claim. They claim that the center&#x27;s dismissal of the document and strategy is disingenuous, as when the center&#x27;s actions in the political sphere, such as its Teach the Controversy campaign, are taken into account it becomes apparent that the Wedge strategy is indeed being followed.
*Peer review Though the CSC often claims that articles and books asserting intelligent design are published in the peer-reviewed scientific press, no pro-ID article has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, with the exception of the one that had been quickly retracted by the publisher. That article, titled &quot;The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories&quot;, was by the institute&#x27;s Stephen C. Meyer and was published in &quot;Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington&quot; in 2004. One month after its publication, the journal&#x27;s publisher issued a statement repudiating the article as not meeting its scientific standards and as having sidestepped peer review (see Sternberg peer review controversy).

Intellectual dishonesty, in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence; and a lack of rigor are the most common criticisms of the center. Critics have also stated that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Its critics, such as Eugenie Scott, Robert Pennock, and Barbara Forrest, claim that the CSC knowingly misquotes scientists and other experts, deceptively omits contextual text through ellipsis, and makes unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials.

Barbara Forrest, author of &quot;Creationism&#x27;s Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design&quot; and Glenn Branch say that the CSC uses academic credentials and affiliations opportunistically. In 2001 the Discovery Institute purchased advertisements in three national publications (&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;New Republic&quot; and &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;) to proclaim the adherence of approximately 100 scientists to the following statement: &quot;We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.&quot;

Such statements usually refer to the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory&#x27;s PhD or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the University of Texas, Ohio University, and the University of California, Berkeley, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: Probe Ministries for Bohlin, the Reasons to Believe ministry for Rana, and the CSC for Wells. During controversies over evolution education in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas, similar lists of local scientists were circulated.

Alongside the allegation that the center intentionally misrepresents facts, Eugenie Scott and other critics say there is a noticeable conflict between what the CSC tells the public through the media and what they say before conservative Christian audiences. They contend that this is a studied and deliberate attempt at the obfuscation advocated by Wedge strategy author Phillip E. Johnson.

Critics can also be found outside of the scientific community. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State has voiced First Amendment concerns over Discovery Institute&#x27;s activities. He described the approach of the teach the controversy movement&#x27;s proponents as &quot;a disarming subterfuge designed to undermine solid evidence that all living things share a common ancestry&quot;:

In 2004, Barbara Forrest and Paul R. Gross published &quot;Creationism&#x27;s Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design&quot; documenting the history of the intelligent design movement and the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture as well as critiquing ID research. Forrest and Gross referred to the group as an outgrowth of Johnson&#x27;s religious mission and explored its plans for &quot;a rigorously God-centered view of creation, including a new &#x27;science&#x27; based solidly on theism.&quot;

==Funding==
The center is funded through the Discovery Institute, which is largely underwritten by grants and gifts from wealthy Christian fundamentalist conservative individuals and groups, such as Howard Ahmanson Jr., Philip F. Anschutz, Richard Mellon Scaife, and the Maclellan Foundation.

Published reports place the Discovery Institute&#x27;s budget for ID-related programs at over $4 million per year. The center&#x27;s expenditures can be assumed to be substantial based on the scope and quality of the center&#x27;s extensive public relations campaigns, materials and contributions to local and regional ID and Teach the Controversy efforts.

CSC director, Stephen C. Meyer, admits most of the center&#x27;s money comes from wealthy donors from the Christian right. Howard Ahmanson Jr., who provided $1.5 million in funding that established the center, has said his goal is &quot;the total integration of biblical law into our lives.&quot; The Maclellan Foundation commits itself to &quot;the infallibility of the Scripture.&quot; Most Discovery Institute donors have also contributed significantly to the George W. Bush campaign. Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian reconstructionist Chalcedon Foundation, and funds many causes important to the Christian right, including Christian reconstructionism.

<text>The Piney River is a stream that drains a portion of the U.S. state of Tennessee&#x27;s Cumberland Plateau generally known as Walden Ridge. The Piney River rises near the Rhea County – Bledsoe County line and is referred to as Piney Creek in its upper reaches roughly until its confluence with Duskin Creek. Its major tributary, Little Piney Creek, flows over two spectacular waterfalls which are located in Piney Falls State Natural Area near the community of Grandview. 
A tributary of Little Piney Creek is Soak Creek, Tennessee&#x27;s newest State Scenic River.
The confluence of the two streams occurs below the falls of the smaller stream in an area referred to as &quot;Shut-in Gap&quot;. The stream flows out of the gap and is bridged by State Route 68 just before that road begins its steep climb up the Cumberland Escarpment onto Waldens Ridge. The stream flows north of Spring City, Tennessee and becomes slack just east of the town at a headland of Watts Bar Lake, an impoundment of the Tennessee River formed by the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Watts Bar Dam project. The mouth of the Piney is one of the larger bays of Watts Bar Lake and contains several small islands.

The Cumberland Trail follows the Piney River.

<text>Mohammed Dib (; 21 July 1920 – 2 May 2003) was an Algerian author. He wrote over 30 novels, as well as numerous short stories, poems, and children&#x27;s literature in the French language. His work covers the breadth of 19th century Algerian history, focusing on Algeria&#x27;s fight for independence.

==Life==
Dib was born in Tlemcen in Algeria, near the border with Morocco, into a middle-class family which had descended into poverty. After losing his father at a young age, Dib started writing poetry at 15. At the age of 18 he started working as a teacher in nearby Oujda in Morocco. In his twenties and thirties he worked in various capacities as a weaver, teacher, accountant, interpreter (for the French and British military), and journalist (for newspapers including &quot;Alger Républicain&quot; and &quot;Liberté&quot;, an organ of the Algerian Communist Party). In 1952, two years before the Algerian revolution, he married a French woman, joined the Algerian Communist Party and visited France. In the same year he published his first novel La Grande Maison (The Great House). Dib was a member of the &quot;Generation of &#x27;52&quot; — a group of Algerian writers which included Albert Camus and Mouloud Feraoun.

In 1959, he was expelled from Algeria by the French authorities for his support for Algerian independence, and also because of the success of his novels (which depicted the reality of life in colonial Algeria for most Algerians). Instead of moving to Cairo as many Algerian nationalists had, he decided to live in France, where he was allowed to stay after various writers (including Camus) lobbied the French government. From 1967 he lived mainly in La Celle-Saint-Cloud near Paris.

From 1976-1977 Dib was teacher at the University of California at Los Angeles. He also was a professor at the Sorbonne in Paris. In his later years he often travelled to Finland, which was a setting for some of his later novels. He died at La Celle-Saint-Cloud on 2 May 2003. In a tribute, the then French Culture Minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon said that Dib was &quot;a spiritual bridge between Algeria and France, between the north and the Mediterranean.&quot;

==Awards==
* 1953 Fénéon Prize
* 1994 the grand prix de la Francophonie
* 1998 Mallarmé prize

==Work==
In his work, Dib was concerned with bringing the authentic experience of Algerian life to a wider, particularly French-speaking, world. The Algerian revolution (1954–1962) profoundly shaped his thinking, and made him eager to bring to the world&#x27;s attention Algeria&#x27;s struggle for independence. An advocate of political equality, he believed that &quot;the things that make us different always remain secondary.&quot; He has received many awards from the French literary establishment.

===Novels===
His debut novel &quot;La grande maison&quot; was the first part of the &quot;Algerian trilogy&quot; about a large Algerian family. The main protagonist, Omar, is a young boy growing up in poverty in Algeria just before World War II. The trilogy is presented in a naturalistic style similar to that of Émile Zola. The second part, &quot;L&#x27;Incendie&quot;, published in the same year the Algerian revolution started, was about Omar&#x27;s life during the second World War. The final part of the trilogy, &quot;Le Métier à tisser&quot;, deals with Omar&#x27;s adult life as a working man in Algeria. It was published in 1957. The trilogy was partly autobiographical.

His later works did not always use the same naturalistic framework of his earlier novels, often adding surrealistic elements. He used science fiction in &quot;Qui se souvient de la mer&quot; (1962), and verse in his last novel &quot;L.A. Trip&quot;.

From 1985 to 1994 he wrote four semi-autobiographical novels about a North African man who visits a Nordic country, has a relationship and child with a woman in this country. The last novel in this series deals with the child visiting her fathers homeland. Dib also helped to translate into French various Finnish books.

<text>The conspiracy of Gaius Calpurnius Piso in 65 CE was a major turning point in the reign of the Roman emperor Nero (reign 54–68). The plot reflected the growing discontent among the ruling class of the Roman state with Nero&#x27;s increasingly despotic leadership, and as a result is a significant event on the road toward his eventual suicide and the chaos of the Year of the Four Emperors which followed.

== Plot ==

Gaius Calpurnius Piso, a leading Roman statesman, benefactor of literature, and orator, intended to have Nero assassinated, and replace him as emperor through acclamation by the Praetorian Guard. The conspiracy emerged in AD 65, enlisting the support of several prominent senators, equestrians, and soldiers. According to the Roman historian Tacitus, the ringleaders included a Praetorian tribune named Subrius Flavus, and a centurion named Sulpicius Asper, who helped Piso devise the plot, among others. 

The conspiracy was put in jeopardy by a woman named Epicharis, who divulged parts of the plan to Volusius Proculus, commanding a fleet in Misenum. Epicharis was involved with the conspiracy and was attempting to move it along faster. When Proculus complained to Epicharis that Nero did not favor him, she informed him of the conspiracy. Proculus informed Nero of the conspiracy and Epicharis was arrested. Though she denied the accusations, the conspiracy collapsed and Epicharis was tortured brutally. While on transport to be tortured a second time, she committed suicide by strangling herself with her own girdle. The conspirators, acting more quickly, rejected a plan to kill Nero at Baiae, but settled on murdering him in Rome at games. They had a loosely conceived plan in which Faenius Rufus – joint prefect of the Praetorian Guard with Ofonius Tigellinus – would conduct Piso to the Praetorian Camp, where the Guard would acclaim him as emperor.

On the morning that the conspirators&#x27; plot was to be carried out – 19 April – a freedman named Milichus informed on his former master Flavius Scaevinus after receiving orders to sharpen a knife and prepare bandages. Tacitus attributes his decision to give his former master up to greed and avarice at the urging of his wife, reporting it to Nero&#x27;s secretary, Epaphroditus. Scaevinus initially was able to avoid suspicion, discrediting the evidence as circumstantial before giving in under the threat of torture and further evidence from Milichus&#x27; wife reporting on a long secret meeting between Scaevinus and Antonius Natalis, another conspirator. When Scaevinus was given over to fellow conspirator praetorian prefect Faenius Rufus for punishment, he inculpated him as well; another conspirator, Subrius Flavus, openly expressed his hatred of Nero in court, justifying with reference to Nero&#x27;s matricide, crimes, and &quot;parad[ing] as a charioteer [and] actor&quot;.
Nero ordered Piso, the philosopher Seneca, Seneca&#x27;s nephew Lucan, and the satirist Petronius to commit suicide. Many others were also killed. In Plutarch&#x27;s version, one of the conspirators remarked to a condemned prisoner that all would change soon (because Nero would be dead). The prisoner reported the conversation to Nero, who had the conspirator tortured until he confessed the plot. The ancient Roman historian Tacitus writes in his &quot;Annals&quot; that &quot;it was rumoured that Subrius Flavus and the centurions had decided in private conference... that, once Nero had been struck down by the agency of Piso, Piso should be disposed of... and the empire made over to Seneca; who would thus appear to have been chosen for the supreme power by innocent men&quot;.

== Named conspirators ==

At least 41 individuals were accused of being part of the conspiracy. Of the known 41, there were 19 senators, seven equites, 11 soldiers, and four women.

=== Executed or forced to commit suicide ===
Piso, Plautius Lateranus, Lucan, Afranius Quintianus, Flavius Scaevinus, Claudius Senecio, Vulcatius Araricus, Julius Augurinus, Munatius Gratus, Marcius Festus, Faenius Rufus, Subrius Flavus, Sulpicius Asper, Maximus Scaurus, Venetus Paulus, Epicharis, Seneca the Younger, Antonia, Marcus Julius Vestinus Atticus.

=== Exiled or denigrated ===
Novius Priscus, Annius Pollio, Publius Glitius Gallus, Rufrius Crispinus, Verginius Flavus, Musonius Rufus, Cluvidienus Quietus, Julius Agrippa, Blitius Catulinus, Petronius Pricus, Julius Altinus, Caesennius Maximus, Caedicia (wife of Flavius Scaevinus).

=== Pardoned or acquitted ===
Antonius Natalis, Cervarius Proculus, Statius Proximus (but afterwards committed suicide), Gavius Silvanus (also afterwards committed suicide), Acilia Lucana.

== Modern fiction ==
The Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, in his book &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;. used many of the themes, while the setting took place in the time of the plot. In the last scene of the book, one of the plotters, Petronius, committed suicide after having a lavish party.

The novel by Naomi Mitchison, &quot;The Blood of the Martyrs&quot; (1939), is set in the months leading up to the failure of the conspiracy.

It is the topic of John Hersey&#x27;s epistolary novel &quot;The Conspiracy&quot; (1972).

<text>Poul Hartling (14 August 1914 – 30 April 2000) was a Danish politician and diplomat. He was leader of Venstre from 1965 to 1977, and served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 1973 to 1975. Prior to that, he served as foreign minister from 1968 to 1971 under Hilmar Baunsgaard. From 1978 to 1985, he served as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

==Career==

Hartling graduated in theology 1939, became ordained as a priest, and later headed a teacher&#x27;s seminary. He was a member of parliament 1957–1960, and again 1964–1977, and party leader 1965–1977. Hartling served as Foreign Minister of Denmark from 1968 until 1971 in the Cabinet of Hilmar Baunsgaard. Hartling was Prime Minister from 1973 until 1975. In the chaotic situation with many new parties after the 1973 Danish parliamentary election his single party minority government commanded only 22 out 179 seats in parliament. In social policy, Hartling&#x27;s time as Prime Minister witnessed the passage of the Social Assistance Act of 1974, which instructed municipal authorities to provide day-care and recreation centres for children and young people.

Hartling then left Danish politics to work for the United Nations. He was the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) from 1978 until 1985. In 1981 Hartling accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the UNHCR.

Hartling died 30 April 2000 in Copenhagen. He is buried with his wife Elsebeth in Hørsholm.

<text>Poul Heegaard (; November 2, 1871, Copenhagen - February 7, 1948, Oslo) was a Danish mathematician active in the field of topology. His 1898 thesis introduced a concept now called the Heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold. Heegaard&#x27;s ideas allowed him to make a careful critique of work of Henri Poincaré. Poincaré had overlooked the possibility of the appearance of torsion in the homology groups of a space.

He later co-authored, with Max Dehn, a foundational article on combinatorial topology, in the form of an encyclopedia entry.

Heegaard studied mathematics at the University of Copenhagen from 1889 to 1893. Following years of travelling, and teaching mathematics, he was appointed professor at University of Copenhagen in 1910. An English translation of his 1898 thesis, which laid a rigorous topological foundation for modern knot theory, may be found at https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/heegaardenglish.pdf. The section on &quot;a visually transparent representation of the complex points of an algebraic surface&quot; is especially important.

In 1936, Heegaard served as the President of The Third International Congress of Nationalists at The Nobel Institute. Following a talk titled &quot;A Biologist&#x27;s View of the Future of the White Race,&quot; Heegaard hosted a garden party for the Congress participants.

Following a dispute with the faculty over, among other things, the hiring of Harald Bohr as professor at the University (which Heegaard opposed); Heegaard accepted a professorship at Oslo in Norway, where he worked till his retirement in 1941.

<text>Puerto Ayacucho () is the capital and largest city of Amazonas State in Venezuela. Puerto Ayacucho is located across the Orinoco River from the Colombian village of Casuarito.

The city was founded to facilitate the transport of goods past the Atures Rapids on the Orinoco River in the late 19th century (mostly rubber). Now the economy is supported by both national and international tourism. Also based here is the Venezuelan army and navy, conducting a continuous low level campaign against incursions and drug-runners from nearby Colombia. The climate is equatorial and the surrounding rainforests are some of the world&#x27;s least explored and most untouched. The nearby forested mountains (tepuis) contain some of the world&#x27;s least investigated microsystems.

== History ==

Puerto Ayacucho began to be built in 1924 at the initiative of the regime of Juan Vicente Gómez, who was alerted to the strategic riches of the region, and was officially founded on December 9, 1928, in commemoration of the Battle of Ayacucho, by the engineer and geologist Santiago Aguerrevere. It thus replaced San Fernando de Atabapo, which had been the administrative center of this former district, then province, later federal territory and finally state. Located on a huge black granite rock, facing the Colombian shore, the city is today the most important town in Amazonas and a river port that brings together the economic activity of the area.

The second &quot;Simón Bolívar&quot; Hospital. It was inaugurated on August 11, 1938, by Governor Rafael Simón Urbina. It was built under the direction and design of Father Alfredo Bonvecchio. Dr. López Rivas, employed by the then Ministry of Health, attended from this hospital. He arrived in Puerto Ayacucho on October 26, 1937. He was the first doctor who practiced his profession in the city that was born, as a government employee. The work was decreed and started by the previous governor Alfredo Franco. It is the current Casa Sindical.

The oldest known map of Puerto Ayacucho was drawn by Ramón Ojeda Briceño, Bachelor of Pharmacy, in 1940.There were 120 houses and between 600 and 700 inhabitants, most of them with palm roofs, dirt floors and wattle and daub walls.

This city grew at a very slow pace until the 60&#x27;s. From the 70&#x27;s onwards, there was a real explosion or growth, mainly due to the internal migration of the Territory itself, and later to the immigration of people from other neighboring states.

== Geography ==

200 km to the south is the Casiquiare canal, a waterway that links South America&#x27;s two largest river systems, the Amazon and the Orinoco. This was first visited by Europeans in the 17th century and explored in 1800 by naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who commented on the recent extinction of the Aturès Indians for whom the Atures Rapids had been named. The water in the Casiquiare flows from the Orinoco River into the Rio Negro, tributary of the Amazon, though much more is gathered en route from numerous tributaries.

90 km to the east is the second highest waterfall in Venezuela, the 2,200 ft (670 m) Yutaje Falls. The surrounding rainforest contains some facilities for tourists, including an airstrip, and the area also has a large population of greenwing macaws, &quot;Ara chloroptera&quot;. There are also jaguars, pink river dolphins, numerous monkeys and other bird life.

The inhabitants are mostly &quot;mestizo&quot; – of mixed indigenous and Spanish descent. There are a number of local indigenous tribes including the Yanomami, the Panare, the Bari, Piaroa, and Guajibo (also known as Jibis).

===Climate===
Puerto Ayacucho has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;) with a short dry season from December to March.

== Transportation ==

Two national highways connect it with the rest of the country. The first is Troncal 12, via Caicara del Orinoco. The second is Troncal 2, via San Fernando de Apure, which intercepts Troncal 12 in the vicinity of Puerto Páez, Apure State.

The city has a national airport, Cacique Aramare Airport, located south of the city. It currently provides commercial services through the national airline Conviasa, which has one daily flight from the Simón Bolívar International Airport (Maiquetía). Local flights depart from Cacique Aramare Airport to other towns in the state, such as San Juan de Manapiare, Maroa, San Fernando de Atabapo, San Carlos de Río Negro and La Esmeralda.

<text>Nova Aliança is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The population is 7,068 (2020 est.) in an area of 217.5 km2. Nova Aliança belongs to the Mesoregion of São José do Rio Preto.

== History ==
In 1910, the families of Zeferino Gotardi, Jorge Galvão, Paschoal Proto, Gasparo Traldi and Luís Guilhermitti left São Joaquim da Barra, São Paulo, to settle in this region for its fertile soil which allowed for better farming. The name &quot;Aliança&quot; was chosen because the founders were originally from a farm called &quot;Bela Aliança&quot;.

In the early twentieth century, the town of Monte Belo in the region faced rapid growth, most of which was in the agricultural sector. The population reached an estimated 500 inhabitants and urban development including homes and judicial buildings. The growth was soon interrupted by a malaria epidemic that killed many people.

The municipality was created by state law in 1944.
== Government ==
* Mayor: Jurandir Barbosa de Moraes (2021-)

<text>In mathematics, an abelian variety &quot;A&quot; defined over a field &quot;K&quot; is said to have CM-type if it has a large enough commutative subring in its endomorphism ring End(&quot;A&quot;). The terminology here is from complex multiplication theory, which was developed for elliptic curves in the nineteenth century. One of the major achievements in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry of the twentieth century was to find the correct formulations of the corresponding theory for abelian varieties of dimension &quot;d&quot; &gt; 1. The problem is at a deeper level of abstraction, because it is much harder to manipulate analytic functions of several complex variables.

The formal definition is that 

:formula_1

the tensor product of End(&quot;A&quot;) with the rational number field Q, should contain a commutative subring of dimension 2&quot;d&quot; over Q. When &quot;d&quot; = 1 this can only be a quadratic field, and one recovers the cases where End(&quot;A&quot;) is an order in an imaginary quadratic field. For &quot;d&quot; &gt; 1 there are comparable cases for CM-fields, the complex quadratic extensions of totally real fields. There are other cases that reflect that &quot;A&quot; may not be a simple abelian variety (it might be a cartesian product of elliptic curves, for example). Another name for abelian varieties of CM-type is abelian varieties with sufficiently many complex multiplications.

It is known that if &quot;K&quot; is the complex numbers, then any such &quot;A&quot; has a field of definition which is in fact a number field. The possible types of endomorphism ring have been classified, as rings with involution (the Rosati involution), leading to a classification of CM-type abelian varieties. To construct such varieties in the same style as for elliptic curves, starting with a lattice Λ in C&quot;d&quot;, one must take into account the Riemann relations of abelian variety theory.

The CM-type is a description of the action of a (maximal) commutative subring &quot;L&quot; of EndQ(&quot;A&quot;) on the holomorphic tangent space of &quot;A&quot; at the identity element. Spectral theory of a simple kind applies, to show that &quot;L&quot; acts via a basis of eigenvectors; in other words &quot;L&quot; has an action that is via diagonal matrices on the holomorphic vector fields on &quot;A&quot;. In the simple case, where &quot;L&quot; is itself a number field rather than a product of some number of fields, the CM-type is then a list of complex embeddings of &quot;L&quot;. There are 2&quot;d&quot; of those, occurring in complex conjugate pairs; the CM-type is a choice of one out of each pair. It is known that all such possible CM-types can be realised.

Basic results of Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama compute the Hasse–Weil L-function of &quot;A&quot;, in terms of the CM-type and a Hecke L-function with Hecke character, having infinity-type derived from it. These generalise the results of Max Deuring for the elliptic curve case.

<text>Clermont is a rural town and locality in the Isaac Region, Queensland, Australia. Clermont is a major hub for the large coal mines in the region, and is also a service town for agricultural properties in the area. In the , the locality of Clermont had a population of 2,952 people.

== Geography ==
Clermont is south-west of Mackay, at the junction of the Gregory and Peak Downs highways.

The historic towns of North Copperfield () and South Copperfield (), often referred to collectively as Copperfield are along Christoe Street approximately south-west of the Clermont town centre.

The Gregory Highway runs through the eastern end, and the Peak Downs Highway enters from the east. The Clermont Connection Road links the Gregory Highway to the CBD, and the Clermont-Alpha Road starts in the CBD and exits to the south-west.

===Climate===
== History ==

&quot;Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu)&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure, extending south towards the Dawson River.

Ludwig Leichhardt was the first European to pass through the Clermont area in 1845, but it was the discovery of gold in 1861 that was responsible for the establishment of the town, close to what was Babbinburra clan land. 

The town reserve was proclaimed on 25 March 1864, although a gold field was declared in the area in 1862. Clermont is named after Clermont-Ferrand in France; Clermont-Ferrand was the ancestral home of Oscar de Satge, one of the first European graziers who owned the Wolfang Downs pastoral run.

Theresa Creek Post Office opened by 1863, was replaced by Coppermines Post Office at the end of 1863 and Clermont Post Office in 1864.

In the 1860s and 1870s the area around Clermont was known as &quot;the Peak Downs&quot;. The first newspaper, the Peak Downs Telegram and Mining Record, was established in August 1864, and the first issue was dated Tuesday, 4 October.

In 1935, Clermont was important line linking with Charters Towers for public telephone communications.

The first church in Clermont was a Catholic church opened on Sunday 4 November 1866 and dedicated to St Mary, Blessed Virgin of Sorrows.
Clermont State School opened on 27 August 1867.

A Congregational church opened in North Copperfield in November 1868.

Copper was discovered soon after. In the 1880s up to 4000 Chinese people were resident in Clermont, mining for gold and copper. This led to racial riots and the Chinese were removed from the region in 1888. The decorated soldier Billy Sing was born in Clermont in 1886 of a Chinese father and English mother.

The Presbyterian Church in Clermont was formally re-opened on Sunday 10 June 1883.

The railway was extended north from Emerald to Clermont in February 1884. However, no passenger trains are available to or from Clermont.

A Wesleyan Methodist Church opened in Clermont on the corner of Box Street and Capella Street on Sunday 19 September 1886. This is the site of the current Clermont Uniting Church, but the current church building was built circa 1970.

The town was originally established on low-lying ground next to a lagoon or billabong; flooding was always a problem, with four substantial floods occurring between 1864 and 1896.

St Joseph&#x27;s School opened in January 1900.

The greatest flood, in 1916, killed 65 people out of a town population of 1,500 and remains one of Australia&#x27;s worst natural disasters in terms of life lost. Following the 1916 flood, many of the wooden buildings of the town were moved using steam traction engines to a new townsite on higher ground. A local amateur photographer, Gordon Pullar took numerous photographs of the moving buildings, published in the 1980s as &quot;A Shifting Town&quot;.

In the mid-1920s, &quot;The Capricornian&quot; newspaper refers to a Mr P. Matones (Matonez) as being one of the first owners of the Paris café in Clermont. John (Jack) and Marouli (Monty) Faros took over the Café in the 1930s. It operated until 1992.

The Clermont public library was opened in 1962.

On 27 January 1959 a secondary department was added to Clermont State School, providing secondary education for years 8 to 12. That arrangement ceased with the opening of Clermont State High School on 29 January 1990.

Mistake Creek State School opened in the former locality of Mistake Creek on 24 January 1983.

On 17 May 2019, it was decided to discontinue the locality of Mistake Creek and absorb its land into the neighbouring localities of Clermont, Laglan, Frankfield and Peak Vale.

== Demographics ==
In the , the town of Clermont had a population of 2,177 people.

In the , the locality of Clermont had a population of 3,031 people.

In the , the locality of Clermont had a population of 2,952 people.

== Heritage listings ==
Clermont has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Clermont Cemetery, Cemetery Road
* Stone Farm Building, 739 Fleurs Lane
* Irlam&#x27;s Ant Bed Building, Oaky Creek, west of Clermont on the Clermont-Alpha Road

== Coal mining ==
Glencore is currently operating the Clermont Mine, located north west of Clermont. When the mine reaches full capacity it will produce up to 12.2 million tonnes of thermal coal for international markets. Clermont Mine delivered its first conveyor of coal in April 2010.

Clermont also hosted another larger coal mine; Blair Athol coal mine, located north west of Clermont. The mine supplied customers in Asia and Europe with up to 12 million tonnes of thermal coal per annum. The coal deposit was originally discovered on the site in 1864 and was first mined in 1890. Between 1920 and 1945 coal was mined with an underground method, which is still visible today. The most recent open cut operation started in 1984. Blair Athol Mine was closed on 26 November 2012 after it became completely mined out, with its stockpile and train facilities to be used by the Clermont Mine.

== Education ==
Clermont State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at Hetherington Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 237 students with 20 teachers (18 full-time equivalent) and 12 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent).

Mistake Creek State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at 6652 Alpha Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 14 students with 2 teachers and 2 non-teaching staff (1 full-time equivalent). This school is within the former locality of Mistake Creek, which was discontinued and absorbed into neighbouring localities in May 2019; the school is now within the enlarged boundaries of the locality of Clermont.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at 50 Box Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 106 students with 10 teachers (9 full-time equivalent) and 6 non-teaching staff (3 full-time equivalent).

Clermont State High School is a government secondary (7–12) school for boys and girls at 1 Kitchener Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 182 students with 20 teachers and 15 non-teaching staff (11 full-time equivalent).

== Amenities ==
The Isaac Regional Council operates a public library at the corner of Karmoo and Herschel Street.

The Clermont branch of the Queensland Country Women&#x27;s Association meets at the QCWA Rooms at 28 Sirus Street.

Clermont Uniting Church is at 40 Box Street (corner of Capella Street, ).

Clermont aerodrome lies north northeast of the town.

== Attractions ==
Clermont Historical Centre has displays relating the history of settlement, farming and mining in Clermont, Copperfield, and Blair Athol.

<text>The 1990s brought a growing international awareness of Irish traditional music, along with a period of economic success for Ireland (the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;) and the launch of the music-and-dance show Riverdance. In America, the 1991 television series &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, produced by Philip King, focussed on the Irish roots of much American music, and was followed by other TV productions also themed around Irish music.

As Irish music became more widely performed and increasingly commercialised, debates arose over issues of &quot;purity&quot; in Irish music in the face of diversifying settings and uses, and also over intellectual property inhering in compositions and recordings in the genre.

<doc id="1138258" wikidata="Q7829595" url="?curid=1138258" title="Towcester Racecourse">
<text>Towcester Racecourse is a greyhound racing track and former horse racing venue at Towcester (pronounced &quot;Toh-ster&quot;) in Northamptonshire, England. It has staged the English Greyhound Derby in 2018, 2021 and has won the contract for the next 5 years from 2022.

== Horse racing ==
Horse racing at Towcester goes back to the 18th century. Towcester is one of many places listed in James Christie Whyte&#x27;s &quot;History of the British Turf&quot; where annual horseracing had ceased to occur after 1798.

The first meeting over the modern course took place in 1928. The Towcester Racecourse Company was formed under the direction of Sir Thomas Fermor-Hesketh, later 1st Lord Hesketh, and it was there on his estate of Easton Neston, that the course was sited, and the first grandstand built.
Towcester was popular among the racing fraternity, mostly because of the sharp bends in the course, and the final gallop to the finishing post was uphill, which tested the horses and results in some unexpected finishes.

In 2004, the Easton Neston estate, including the race course, was put up for sale. The third Lord Hesketh later decided to retain ownership of the course and sold only a portion of the estate to a Russian-born businessman.

Entry was free from 2002 until 2006, during which time the course saw attendance grow significantly. In mid-2006, it was announced that from the 26th of December 2006, Towcester would be charging for entry to their two most popular annual meetings; Boxing Day and Easter Sunday. Selected other meetings were free.

In 2008, Lord Hesketh decided to sell the course, which was offered as a going concern.

On 7 November 2013, jockey Tony McCoy got his 4,000th career win at Towcester, riding Mountain Tunes to win the Weatherbys Novices&#x27; Hurdle.

== Greyhound racing ==
A greyhound racing track has been built inside the racecourse, which opened in December 2014.

== 2018 administration ==
In August 2018 the future of Towcester racecourse was put in doubt. A statement released by the racecourse on 16 August read: 
On 23 August KPMG were appointed as administrators and 134 out of 137 members of staff at the racecourse were made redundant, many having to claim statutory redundancy from the government. On 13 November, the administrators announced that the racecourse&#x27;s assets were being sold to a company called Fermor Land LLP. This company was formed on 18 October (26 days before the sale) and is headed by Lord Hesketh&#x27;s brother-in-law Mark Westropp, a trustee of the Hesketh Family trusts.

In late October 2019 Kevin Boothby signed a 10-year lease deal for Towcester Racecourse.

<text>Luis Sepúlveda Calfucura (; October 4, 1949 – April 16, 2020) was a Chilean writer and journalist. A communist militant and fervent opponent of Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s regime, he was imprisoned and tortured by the military dictatorship during the 1970s. Sepúlveda authored numerous poetry books and short stories; in addition to Spanish, his mother tongue, he also spoke English, the language in which he wrote his first novel, &quot;El viejo que leía novelas de amor&quot; (&quot;The Old Man Who Read Love Stories)&quot;.

== Biography ==
Luis Sepúlveda was born in Ovalle, Limarí Province, Chile in 1949. His father, José Sepúlveda, was a militant of the Chilean Communist Party; and his mother, Irma Calfucura, was a nurse of Mapuche descent. After High School in Santiago, he studied theatre production at the National University of Chile.

Luis Sepúlveda was politically active first as a leader of the student movement and in the Salvador Allende administration in the department of cultural affairs where he was in charge of a series of cheap editions of classics for the general public. He also acted as a mediator between the government and Chilean companies.

After the Chilean coup of 1973 which brought to power General Augusto Pinochet he was jailed for two-and-a-half years and then obtained a conditional release through the efforts of the German branch of Amnesty International and was kept under house arrest.

He managed to escape and went underground for nearly a year. With the help of a friend who was head of the Alliance française in Valparaíso he set up a drama group that became the first cultural focus of resistance. He was rearrested and given a life sentence (later reduced to twenty-eight years) for treason and subversion.

The German section of Amnesty International intervened again and his prison sentence was commuted to eight years of exile, and in 1977 he left Chile to fly to Sweden where he was supposed to teach Spanish literature. At the first stopover in Buenos Aires he escaped and managed to enter Uruguay. Because the political situations in both Argentina and Uruguay were similar to those in his home country, Sepúlveda went to São Paulo in Brazil and then to Paraguay. He had to leave again because of the local regime and finally settled in Quito in Ecuador guest of his friend Jorge Enrique Adoum. He directed the Alliance Française theatre, founded a theatrical company and took part in a UNESCO expedition to assess the impact of colonization on the Shuar people.

During the expedition he shared the life of the Shuars for seven months and came to an understanding of Latin America as a multicultural and multilingual continent where the Marxism he was taught was not applicable to a rural population that was dependent on its surrounding natural environment. He worked in close contact with organizations of the Indigenous people and drafted the first literacy teaching plan for the Imbabura peasants&#x27; federation, in the Andes. 

In 1979, he joined the Simón Bolívar International Brigade which was fighting in Nicaragua and after the victory of the revolution he started working as a journalist and one year later he left for Europe.

He went to Hamburg in Germany because of his admiration of German literature (he learned the language in prison) especially the romantics such as Novalis and Friedrich Hölderlin and worked there as journalist traveling widely in Latin America and Africa.
In 1982, he came in contact with Greenpeace and worked until 1987 as a crew member on one of their ships. He later acted as coordinator between various branches of the organization. His environmental activism then continued after he left Greenpeace. For example, he was a strong advocate for environmental protection in his beloved Patagonia, the subject of some of his most popular works. 

In 1988 he won the Tigre Juan Award for his novel &quot;Un viejo que leía novelas de amor&quot;, and in 2009 he won the &quot;Premio Primavera de Novela&quot; for his novel &quot;La sombra de lo que fuimos&quot;. He wrote novels, children&#x27;s books, and travel guides. He was also a film writer and director.

On March 1, 2020, after returning from a conference in Portugal, he was confirmed as the first man in the Asturias region of Spain to be infected by COVID-19. By March 11, it was reported that Sepúlveda was in critical condition, that he was in an induced coma with assisted breathing due to multiple organ failure in an Oviedo hospital. He died on April 16 due to the virus.

== Critical reception ==
Sepúlveda&#x27;s work has received particular attention for its contributions to discussions of environmental issues in Latin America. Laura Barbas-Rhoden contends that &quot;The Old Man Who Read Love Stories&quot; critiques environmentally destructive neocolonial modernization schemes. Scott M. DeVries asserts that several moments in &quot;The Old Man Who Read Love Stories&quot; &quot;articulate an environmentalist ideology from the perspective of the Spanish American &quot;novela de la selva.&quot;&quot; Jonathan Tittler compares the environmental ethics and narrative structure of &quot;The Old Man Who Read Love Stories&quot; with Mario Vargas Llosa&#x27;s &quot;The Storyteller.&quot; Juan Gabriel Araya Grandón describes Sepúlveda&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;Mundo del fin del mundo&quot; (&quot;World at the End of the World&quot;) as an eco-narrative based on a critical discourse that addresses the fundamental tension between environmentalist and extractivist forces. Adrian Taylor Kane argues that &quot;The Old Man Who Read Love Stories&quot; and &quot;World at the End of the World&quot; undermine the Eurocentric notion of modernity proffered by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento in his 1845 treatise &quot;Civilización y barbarie o vida de Juan Facundo Quiroga&quot; by ironically inverting Sarmiento’s concept of civilization and barbarism.

<text>A folk club is a regular event, permanent venue, or section of a venue devoted to folk music and traditional music. Folk clubs were primarily an urban phenomenon of 1960s and 1970s Great Britain and Ireland, and vital to the second British folk revival, but continue today there and elsewhere. In America, as part of the American folk music revival, they played a key role not only in acoustic music, but in launching the careers of groups that later became rock and roll acts.

==British clubs==
===Origins===
From the end of the Second World War there had been attempts by the English Folk Dance and Song Society in London and Birmingham to form clubs where traditional music could be performed. A few private clubs, like the Good Earth Club and the overtly political Topic Club in London, were formed by the mid-1950s and were providing a venue for folk song, but the folk club movement received its major boost from the short-lived British skiffle craze, from about 1955 to 1959, creating a demand for opportunities to play versions of American folk, blues and jazz music, often on assorted acoustic and improvised instruments. This included, as the name suggests, the &#x27;Ballad and Blues&#x27; club in The Round House, Wardour Street, Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl, although the date and nature of the club in its early years is disputed.

As the craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n’ roll music. The Ballad and Blues Club became the ‘Singer Club’ and, in 1961 moved to the Princess Louise pub in Holborn, with the emphasis increasingly placed on English traditional music and singing the songs of one&#x27;s own culture, e.g. English singers should avoid imitating Americans and vice versa, using authentic acoustic instruments and styles of accompaniment. This led to the creation of strict &#x27;policy clubs&#x27;, that pursued a pure and traditional form of music. This became the model for a rapidly expanding movement and soon every major city in Britain had its own folk club.

By the mid-1960s there were probably over 300 in Britain, providing an important circuit for acts that performed traditional songs and tunes acoustically, where some could sustain a living by playing to a small but committed audience. Scottish folk clubs were less dogmatic than their English counterparts and continued to encourage a mixture of Scottish, Irish, English and American material. Early on they hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall (1936–98), Jimmie Macgregor (b. 1930) and The Corries. Some of the most influential clubs in the UK included Les Cousins, Bunjies and The Troubadour, in London and the Bristol Troubadour in England&#x27;s West Country. In Scotland there were notable clubs in Aberdeen. Edinburgh (Edinburgh Folk Club) and Glasgow.

===Nature===
Although the name suggests a fixed space, most clubs were simply a regular gathering, usually in the back or upstairs room of a public house on a weekly basis. These clubs were largely an urban phenomenon and most members seem to have been from the urbanised middle classes, although the material that was increasingly their focus was that of the rural (and to a lesser extent industrial) working classes. The clubs were known for the amateur nature of their performances, often including, or even focusing on local ‘floor singers’, of members who would step up to sing one or two songs. They also had ‘residents’, usually talented local performers who would perform regular short sets of songs. In the late 1960s and early 1970s especially in the West country there was quite a revival of local folk clubs with regular weekly gatherings in places like Taunton, Halberton, Ottery St Mary, Exeter, Barnstaple, Truro, Padstow where a new group of local performers such as Cyril Tawney performed regularly along with local singers performing &quot;Come all Ye&quot; nights

Many of these later emerged as major performers in their own right, including A.L. Lloyd, Martin Carthy, and Shirley Collins who were able to tour the clubs as a circuit and who also became major recording artists. A later generation of performers used the folk club circuit for highly successful mainstream careers, including Billy Connolly, Jasper Carrott, Ian Dury and Barbara Dickson.

===Later years===
The number of clubs began to decline in the 1980s, in the face of changing musical and social trends. In London Les Cousins in Greek Street, where John Renbourn often played, and The Scots Hoose in Cambridge Circus, were both casualties.
The Singers Club (George IV, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn) closed its doors in 1993.

The decline began to stabilise in the mid-1990s with the resurgence of interest in folk music and there are now over 160 folk clubs in the United Kingdom, including many that can trace their origins back to the 1950s including The Bridge Folk Club in Newcastle (previously called the Folk Song and Ballad club) claims to the oldest club still in existence in its original venue (1953). In Edinburgh, Sandy Bell&#x27;s club in Forest Hill has been running since the late 1960s. In London, the Troubadour at Earl&#x27;s Court, where Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Sandy Denny and Martin Carthy sang, became a poetry club in the 1990s, but is now a folk club again.

The nature of surviving folk clubs has also changed significantly, many larger clubs use PA systems, opening the door to use of electric instruments, although drums and full electric line-ups remain rare. The mix of music often includes American roots music, blues, British folk rock, and world music as well as traditional British folk music. From 2000, the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards have included an award for the best folk club.

Since 2002 A &quot;public entertainment licence&quot; was required from local authorities for almost any kind of public performance of music. To avoid the constant need to re-apply for licences for new events, some folk clubs opted to create a &quot;Private members club&quot; instead. This required that members of the public join at least 24 hours in advance, not on the night of the actual performance. Licensing laws changed over the following years. As a result of changes by the Live Music Act 2012, for example, live music in on-licensed premises is no longer a licensable activity between 08:00 and 23:00 hours before audiences of up to 200 people.

==Irish clubs==
A revival of Irish traditional music took place around the turn of the 20th century, which included feiseanna, céilís and organised music competitions. Dancing and singing took place at well-known venues where local and itinerant musicians were welcome. An older style of singing called &quot;sean-nós&quot; (&quot;in the old style&quot;), which is a form of traditional Irish singing was still found, mainly for very poetic songs in the Irish language. Under pressure from the clergy and the government of the time these were forced to curtail their activities.
After a decline through the nineteen forties, an effort was made by a group of pipers to revive the folk tradition. The first national festival of Irish traditional music was held in Mullingar in 1951. In the same year Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was founded, dedicated to the promotion of the music, song, and dance of Ireland. Also, during the following years, came a growth of interest in the folk revival that was taking place in Britain and the US, and the success of The Clancy Brothers in the US. Folk clubs sprung up in Dublin and other Irish cities and towns in the early sixties, which were frequented by the likes of the Abbey Tavern Singers, The Dubliners, The Johnstons, The Pattersons, Tír na nÓg and Sweeney&#x27;s Men.

The first folk club in Dublin was the Coffee Kitchen in Molesworth St., run by Pearse McCall, where Johnny Moynihan met Joe Dolan and Andy Irvine and formed Sweeney&#x27;s Men. Johnny also played in the Neptune Folk Club on Cunningham Road, where he introduced the sea shanty to the Irish Folk Scene. The Auld Triangle was the favourite folk club of the Emmet Spiceland group. The Tradition Folk Club on Wednesdays in Slattery&#x27;s of Capel Street hosted the Press Gang, Al O&#x27;Donnell, Frank Harte and others. The vocal group Garland had a loyal following on the Dublin folk circuit and continued singing as a group for about twenty five years. They mainly played in Dublin clubs such as The Coffee Kitchen, The Universal, The Swamp in Inchicore and The Neptune Folk Club. Garland eventually ran the Folk Club in the Blessington Inn (also known as the Blue Gardenia). They had such guests as Johnny Moynihan, Pumpkinhead and Tony McMahon. In the following decade groups such as The Barleycorn, the Dublin City Ramblers, Planxty and Clannad became popular on the folk scene. There was a weekly radio programme on the Dublin Folk Scene presented by Shay Healy. However the number of folk clubs as such declined after 1980, and at the same time there was a growth of popularity in pub sessions.

Also, Irish cultural centres have existed in the United Kingdom since the 1950s, primarily for the descendants of Irish immigrants. Mostly on Friday and Saturday nights these have been folk clubs in all but name. They have been able to book major Irish bands that ordinary folk clubs could not have afforded.

==American clubs==

New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village was the most famous nexus for folk clubs in the Sixties. While some music took place quite informally in Washington Square Park, a number of clubs, such as The Bitter End and Gerde&#x27;s Folk City were also central to the development of what was originally called &quot;folk music&quot; but would evolve into &quot;Singer–songwriter&quot; music as more and more acoustic musicians performed original material. The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful is one example of a pop group that started in the folk world.

In Boston, the most famous venue was the Club 47, where Joan Baez got her start. Later, this became Passim&#x27;s. (During most of the Seventies, local station WCAS (AM) produced a live broadcast from this club called &quot;Live at Passim&#x27;s&quot;; today the club is known as Club Passim). Other lesser known clubs, such as the Turk&#x27;s Head and the Sword in the Stone (on Charles Street) and, later, the Idler (in Cambridge), also helped to make up what was known as &quot;The Boston Folk Scene&quot;. A number of lesser-known but still active musicians, such as Bill Staines and Chris Smither, also developed in this milieu.

Philadelphia offered two such non-alcohol clubs: Manny Rubin&#x27;s tiny Second Fret (The New Lost City Ramblers, Ian and Sylvia, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins), and, in the Bryn Mawr suburbs, Jeanette Campbell&#x27;s The Main Point, an intimate club featuring artists on their way up such as Joni Mitchell, Janis Ian, Phil Ochs and Bruce Springsteen.

In California, one important San Francisco club was the hungry i; Los Angeles had The Troubadour and McCabe&#x27;s Guitar Shop. The Freight and Salvage has been in operation since 1968.

Caffè Lena in Saratoga Springs, New York claims to be the oldest folk-oriented Coffee House, having opened in 1960. The Eighth Step Coffee House, originally in Albany, New York and now in Schenectady was founded in 1967.

While the folk boom gave way to its rock descendants, forcing many clubs to close or to move to more electric music, in recent years, a number of venues have offered acoustic music (usually original) in a way that continues at least part of the function of the folk clubs. Traditional music, however, which was at the root of these developments, is more often offered by local folk societies, such as , Athens Folk Music and Dance Society, etc.

<doc id="1138274" wikidata="Q17020788" url="?curid=1138274" title="Silly Sisters (album)">
<text>Silly Sisters is a 1976 album by English folk singers Maddy Prior and June Tabor, their first collaborative effort as a duo. The pair later adopted the Silly Sisters name for subsequent projects. The songs cover a wide range of subjects - work, religion, sexual relations, humour, tragedy and the absurd.

Among the session musicians are Martin Carthy, Nic Jones and Andy Irvine who have each recorded solo albums. Johnny Moynihan has recorded with Anne Briggs, Planxty and Sweeney&#x27;s Men. Danny Thompson has recorded with Pentangle, Ralph McTell, Richard Thompson, Nick Drake and John Martyn, among others.

==Track listing==
#&quot;Doffin&#x27; Mistress&quot; (Traditional)
#:&quot;Doffin&#x27; Mistress&quot; was first recorded by Anne Briggs in 1963 on The Iron Muse, and possibly originates in the cotton mills of Ulster. Her version was an influence on both June Tabor and Maddy Prior in their decisions to become singers.
#&quot;Burning of Auchindoon&quot; (Traditional)
#:Child Ballad 183. Based on events in 1592, it concerns a feud between the Huntly family and the Earl of Moray. The ruins of Auchindoun Castle still exist.
#&quot;Lass of Loch Royal&quot; (Traditional)
#:Child Ballad 76. Also known as &quot;Lord Gregory&quot;. Words published by Herd 1776, and in the Scots Musical Museum in 1787. Recorded by Elizabeth Cronin in 1951 and the Everly Brothers in 1959.
#&quot;The Seven Joys of Mary&quot; (Traditional)
#:The earliest version of this song is from the fourteenth century (&quot;Joyes Fyve&quot;). Also collected by Cecil Sharp in 1918 from Mrs Nichols.
#&quot;My Husband&#x27;s Got No Courage In Him&quot; (Traditional)
#:A tragic but bawdy song that was first recorded by Jeannie Robertson.
#&quot;Singing The Travels&quot; (Traditional)
#:Collected from the Symondsbury Mummers. A dispute between a husbandman (a self-employed farmer) and a serving man. Maddy and June sang the same song again on the live album &quot;Ballads and Candles&quot; in 2000, with an extra verse.
#&quot;Silver Whistle&quot; (Traditional)
#:A Jacobite song from Flora MacNeil, translated from Gaelic. Music by Johnny Moynihan.
#&quot;The Grey Funnel Line&quot; (Cyril Tawney)
#:A description of the daily life of a sailor in the Royal Navy (often nicknamed &quot;The grey funnel line&quot; from the battleship grey of its livery), written by Cyril Tawney based on his own life. This recording was used in the opening title sequence in the film &quot;Sirens&quot; starring Hugh Grant.
#&quot;Geordie&quot; (Traditional)
#:Child Ballad 209. A song about Scottish clan loyalty in the Hay family.
#&quot;The Seven Wonders&quot; (Traditional)
#:A Welsh song collected from Jill King. A sequence of ever-more improbable events.
#&quot;Four Loom Weaver&quot; (Traditional)
#:A song about unemployment in the nineteenth century, possibly dating from 1819-20. First recorded by Ewan MacColl in 1951.
#&quot;The Game Of Cards&quot; (Traditional)
#:Also known as &quot;The Game of All Fours&quot;. Noted by Cecil Sharp in 1908. Another erotic song, this time using the language of playing cards to serve as innuendo to another sort of game.
#&quot;Dame Durden&quot; (Traditional)
#:&quot;Alright, chaps. Food!&quot; says Martin Carthy at the start of the song, calling the musicians together. A Copper Family song which is a variation on the &quot;Widdicombe Fair&quot; theme.

<text>Cure4Kids is a web-based education project of St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. Its goal is to help health professionals in countries with limited resources improve the survival rates of children with life-threatening illnesses, including pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease, and HIV/AIDS. The Cure4Kids website provides access to online seminars and conferences with audio narration, presenting current research and best practices, clinical and scientific advances, as well as case studies and treatment analyses. The website also provides access to consultation and mentoring through web-conferencing technology, training for management and analysis of clinical patient information, electronic full-text books and journals, and online courses. The Cure4Kids site contains over 2,000 seminars, courses and conferences. All material can be used and downloaded for reference and educational purposes. Cure4Kids is funded by St. Jude and ALSAC, the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities.

As of May 1, 2012, Cure4Kids had more than 31,000 registered users (including doctors, nurses and other health professionals) in 183 countries. Since its inception in 2002, Cure4Kids users have accessed or downloaded individual content items more than 5.7 million times. Over 300 international groups meet online in Cure4Kids web conferencing rooms to discuss clinical cases and share knowledge on the treatment of cancer and other catastrophic diseases in children. From October 1, 2002, through May 1, 2012, Cure4Kids’ online meeting rooms were accessed over 117,000 times by health professionals for online education and clinical discussions.

In 2007 Cure4Kids also launched Oncopedia, a section in Cure4Kids that is compiled using online submissions from Cure4Kids users. The main purpose of Oncopedia is to provide a forum in which registered Cure4Kids users can participate in asynchronous online discussions of critical issues related to pediatric oncology and hematology. The content includes complex hematology/oncology cases and images with specific questions about patient management, controversial topics, and interesting presentation features, including illustrations of patients&#x27; clinical characteristics and imaging and pathology findings. An international editorial board reviews all the contributions. The cases that are chosen are posted on Oncopedia with expert commentary from our editorial board, and then opened for online moderated discussion. Registered Cure4Kids users can interact online with other users and the editorial board by posting opinions and questions about the content. All material can be freely used and downloaded for reference and educational purposes. Oncopedia combines the open participatory features of collaborative Web sites such as English Wikipedia with the benefits of an international editorial board composed of subject matter experts. Initially, Oncopedia content consisted of case reports, images, and chapters. In 2008 polls, image challenges and educational videos were added as additional tools for education and interaction. As of May 1, 2012, Oncopedia contained 160 case reports, 159 images, 72 videos, 53 chapters, 33 polls and 43 image challenges. Oncopedia has been viewed 160,000 times by 8,654 users.

Cure4Kids for Kids is a community outreach program intended to help children, their parents, and teachers understand the basic science of cancer and its treatment. With culturally sensitive and age-appropriate content, the program is designed to educate children, parents and teachers about cancer and dispel common misconceptions about childhood cancer, instill healthy habits in children that could prevent the development of adult cancer, and increase children&#x27;s overall interest in science and scientific careers. The pilot program contained three educational modules: Cells (presented as the basic unit of life), Cancer (presented as a disease of unhealthy cells) and Healthy Living (presented as practices for cancer prevention such as proper nutrition, safe sun exposure, tobacco control and appropriate physical activity). The Cure4Kids for Kids web site provides cancer education for children in elementary school. For each module, St. Jude provides a teacher&#x27;s guide, children&#x27;s book, activity book, in-class presentation and activities related to the topic. The Cure4Kids for Kids teacher website was developed to support teachers delivering cancer and healthy living education. The Cure4Kids for Kids websites have been viewed over 76,000 times by 11,000 users in 121 countries.

In 2012, Cure4Kids was awarded the Gold Communicator Award from The International Academy of Visual Arts, and a Webby Honoree Award. In 2011 Cure4Kids received the top Platinum award for Best Overall Internet Site at the e-Healthcare Leadership Awards at the 15th Annual Healthcare Internet Conference and a Gold Davey Award. In 2010 Cure4Kids received the Best Medical Website award for Outstanding Achievement in Web Development at the 14th Annual Web Awards. In 2009 Cure4Kids received the Gold Award in the Best Health/Healthcare Content in the Strategic e-Healthcare Awards. In 2008 Cure4Kids won the Gold W3 Web Award in Education Category. In 2007 Cure4Kids was selected as an official honoree for the health category at the 12th Annual Webby Awards.

<text>The House of Haugwitz (&quot;Graf von Haugwitz&quot;, ) is the name of an old and influential Saxon noble family originating from the Meissen region.

== History ==
The Haugwitzs are an ancient aristocratic family from the Lusatia region.

It spread to the area of Germany (Meissen), Silesia (where more than 12 lineages were created), then to Bohemia and Moravia.
At the beginning of the 15th century, the important representatives of the family included Mikuláš Haugvic from Tuhaneč, the court Marshal of Queen Sophia, the wife of Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia.
In 1346, the brothers Otto, Sweydiger, and Kilian von Haugvic settled in Biskupice, Silesia, who founded the new dynastic Haugvic family from Biskupice, which continued to function independently and eventually became the most important Haugvic faction in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. This lasted from 1494 to 1668.

== Lines of the family ==
As of now, four lines of the Haugwitz family are public:

1) Haugwitz from the Meissen line (to this day in Germany)

2) Haugwitz family from Malá Obíše (to this day in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Sweden)

3) Haugwitz family from the Prussian line (to this day in Moravia)

== Notable members ==

* Anna Margareta von Haugwitz, wife of Swedish count, statesman and military commander Carl Gustaf Wrangel
* Georg von Haugwitz 
* Johann IX. von Haugwitz (1524-1595), Bishop of Meissen
* August Adolph von Haugwitz 
* Friedrich Wilhelm &quot;Graf von&quot; Haugwitz (1702, Saxony – 1765), Austrian statesman
* Christian August Heinrich Kurt &quot;Graf von&quot; Haugwitz (1752, Silesia – 1832), Prussian statesman
* Luise von Haugwitz (1782–1855)
* Lawrence (Lance) &quot;Graf von&quot; Haugwitz-Hardenberg-Reventlow (1936–1972), a playboy

She also served on the Steering Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and was the chair of the IPU&#x27;s Latin American Group where she was elected unanimously by parliamentarians from the Latin American nations. Zury was the presidential candidate for the party VIVA at the 2015 elections.

==Family and education==
Zury Ríos Sosa was born in January 1968, the third child of José Efraín Ríos Montt and María Teresa Sosa Ávila. Ríos Sosa&#x27;s father, a former Guatemalan army general and illegitimate President of Guatemala, was found guilty of genocide against the Ixil Maya and crimes against humanity.

Her brothers, Enrique and Homero, both followed their father&#x27;s military footsteps and enlisted in the armed forces: Homero, a military doctor, was killed by guerrillas in 1984, while rescuing wounded army soldiers and attempting to put them aboard an army helicopter that was brought down by rebel weapons fire in El Petén; Enrique was chief of the Army General Staff before resigning his commission in September 2003 when charged with having embezzled Q30 million (€3.25m/US$3.75m). When she was 10 years old, her father renounced Catholicism and became an ordained minister in a Guatemalan offshoot of the Gospel Outreach Church.

Zury Ríos studied at schools in Guatemala and Spain, where her father was assigned as military attaché following the 1974 presidential election, a process tainted by accusations of electoral fraud in which he had been a candidate. She graduated magna cum laude in political and social science from Francisco Marroquín University. Her first job (1988–1989) was as a lecturer in social and economic studies at the Escuela Cristiana Verbo in Guatemala City and she has also worked as a primary school teacher.

She has been married four times. Prior to her current union, she was married to Jeovanny Chávez, deputy José García Bravatti, and businessman Roberto López Villatoro. During her marriage to López Villatoro, she was also known as Ríos de López.

On 20 November 2004, at a ceremony held in General Ríos Montt&#x27;s compound near Antigua Guatemala, and with the general presiding at the ceremony, she married U.S. Congressman Jerry Weller (R-Illinois). Following the wedding, she stated that although she planned to live in the United States with her husband, she would continue serving in the Guatemalan legislature; a lawyer for Weller told the U.S. House Ethics Committee that she did not plan on becoming a U.S. citizen.

In March 2006 the Wellers announced that she was pregnant, and a daughter, Marizú Catherine, was born on 17 August 2006 in a Guatemala City hospital. The child holds dual U.S. and Guatemalan nationality.

==Political career==
In 1989, Zury Ríos joined the public relations department of the newly-created Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) in preparation for the 1990 presidential election. In that election, the FRG won 10 seats in Congress. However, her father was barred from running for president due to a provision in the constitution barring coup leaders from running. Following the election, Zury Ríos worked as an administrative assistant to the FRG congressional bloc and as private secretary to the Speaker of Congress.

In 1996 she was elected to Congress as a national list deputy. In 1998 she was elected to the FRG&#x27;s executive committee and political council.

In 1999 she was re-elected to Congress, again from her party&#x27;s national list. During the 2000–04 legislative session, she served as one of the two deputy speakers and on the congressional foreign relations committee. She was elected to a third term in the 2003 general election, receiving the second highest number of votes on the national electoral lists. During the 2004–08 legislature, she served as vice chair of the foreign relations committee and on the health, sport, social welfare, and ethics committees. Much of her congressional work has focused on reproductive health issues, the HIV-AIDS situation, and combating tobacco use; some of her supporters see her as a potential future foreign minister or even president of the Republic.

In 2003, prior to the election, Zury Ríos was accused of being one of the organizers of &quot;jueves negro&quot; (&quot;Black Thursday&quot;). In mid-2003, the FRG was again trying to get General Ríos Montt on to the presidential ticket by arguing that applying the constitutional ban preventing former coup leaders from seeking the presidency should not apply to him in accordance with the principle of non-retroactive application of the law. His 1982 coup d&#x27;état had preceded the enactment of the 1985 Constitution. After a series of court decisions ruling alternately that he could or could not run, culminating with a 21 July 2003 ruling by the Supreme Court suspending his candidacy, on Thursday, 24 July, FRG officials and supporters led a mass demonstration in Guatemala City to protest his disqualification. The demonstration degenerated into a bloody riot that left one man dead (journalist Héctor Fernando Ramírez) but was perceived as having been successful in forcing the decision to be made to put Ríos Montt&#x27;s name on the presidential ballot since a week later, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala overturned the Supreme Court&#x27;s ban.

Although General Ríos Montt ultimately lost the November 2003 election, he enjoyed his daughter&#x27;s full support. Zury Ríos accompanied her father on his campaign trail, generally introducing him, in highly favorable terms, before he addressed his rallies. She was quoted in the press as saying, &quot;my father is my inspiration.&quot;

She ran for president in 2015, finishing fifth with 5.9% of the vote. Her candidacy for the 2019 presidential election was rejected due to a ban, since repealed, on former dictators and their close relatives running for the presidency. She competed at the presidential elections again in 2023, as one of the favourites for the election due to her status as an opposition figure to the highly unpopular President Alejandro Giammattei, elected in 2019. However, despite initially polling well, leading most opinion polls with 20-25% of responses until April 2023, she ended up in sixth place with an underwhelming 8.69% of the votes.

== Political positions ==
Ríos claims her father&#x27;s political legacy. She is popular with the conservative evangelical electorate and has the support of the army and big business.

She promises a particularly aggressive security policy against gangs and social organisations involved in conflicts with landowners.

She also advocates the implementation of policies expected by conservative evangelicals on issues such as abortion.

She defended the dissolution of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which was investigating corruption in the political class.

<text>5x2 (also &quot;Cinq fois deux&quot;; ) is a 2004 French film directed by François Ozon, which uncovers the back story to the gradual disintegration of a middle class marriage by depicting five key moments in the relationship, but in reverse order.

==Plot==
A young married couple, Gilles and Marion, are in a lawyer&#x27;s office. The lawyer reads out the formal terms of their separation. Then, they book a hotel room together. We then go back in time, with the second chapter showing a tense dinner party, at which Gilles appears to admit to infidelity. The third chapter shows their son&#x27;s birth, which Gilles missed by several hours, leaving Marion in the hospital with only her parents. The fourth chapter shows their wedding day. The final chapter takes place at an Italian beach resort, where their relationship began.

The individual chapters are all punctuated by romantic Italian love songs, which Ozon has said he chose for their &quot;over-the-top sentimentality&quot; and in order to offset the darkness of some of the scenes in the film. Ozon has also said that the backward structure of the story was in part inspired by Jane Campion&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Two Friends&quot;, and that it allowed for &quot;a true, lucid reading of a couple&#x27;s story&quot;.

==Cast==
*Valeria Bruni Tedeschi as Marion
*Stéphane Freiss as Gilles
*Géraldine Pailhas as Valérie
*Françoise Fabian as Monique
*Michael Lonsdale as Bernard
*Antoine Chappey as Christophe Ferrond
*Marc Ruchmann as Mathieu

==Production==
Stéphane Freiss said the hotel rape sequence with Valeria Bruni Tedeschi was &#x27;pretty hardcore&#x27;, explaining that in the screenplay this scene was only a few lines long (it said &#x27;they make love&#x27;) and revealing that after filming François Ozon said to the actors he wasn&#x27;t expecting them to give so much.

<doc id="1138295" wikidata="Q698268" url="?curid=1138295" title="Later Three Kingdoms">
<text>The Later Three Kingdoms period (; c. 890s – 936 AD) of ancient Korea saw a partial revival of the old three kingdoms which had dominated the peninsula from the 1st century BC to the 7th century. After the Unified Silla kingdom had ruled Korea alone from 668, it slowly began to decline and the power vacuum this led to several rebellious states rising up and taking on the old historical names of Korea&#x27;s ancient kingdoms. A messy period of alliances and in-fighting followed, but one state would once again establish a dominant position—Goryeo, itself named in homage to the earlier northern Goguryeo kingdom—and form a unified Korean state and a dynasty which would last almost 500 years.

== Dates ==
The start and end dates of the Later Three Kingdoms are poorly defined and differ across sources. Key events used as starting dates include the first major rebellions against Unified Silla (889), the capture of Gwangju by Kyŏn Hwŏn and subsequent establishment of the Later Baekje state at Jeonju (892), and the proclamation of Later Baekje as a kingdom by Kyŏn Hwŏn (900). Two events mark the end of the Later Three Kindoms: the surrender of Gyeongsun, the last Silla monarch, to Goryeo in 935 and the conquest of Later Baekje by Goryeo in 936.

==History==
The Unified Silla Kingdom (668–935) had held sway over the Korean peninsula for three centuries, but by the 10th century the state had been in steady decline. During this time, local aristocrats developed greater independence, until they functionally became independent warlords. Peasants were regularly robbed.

=== Kyŏn Hwŏn and Kung Ye ===
Kyŏn Hwŏn (867–936), a peasant leader and Silla army officer, took advantage of the political unrest in 892 and made himself military governor of the city of Muju. In 900, Kyŏn joined forces with the bandit ringleader Yang Kil, formed a revival of the old Baekje (Paekche) kingdom in the south-west portion of the peninsula. He chose what is now Jeonju as his capital.

In 901, an aristocratic Buddhist monk leader, Kung Ye, declared a new Goguryeo state in the north. After serving as one of Yang Kil&#x27;s commanders and generals, he betrayed Yang and killed him in 901. His capital was first at Songak (Gaesong) and then Cheorwon. He also twice changed the name of his kingdom, to Majin in 904 and Taebong in 911, although the state is best remembered by the name Later Goguryeo ().

Kung Ye was seen as an eccentric tyrant by both farmers and the upper classes. He reportedly believed himself to be the Maitreya Buddha, claimed he had mind reading powers, and reportedly had 200 monks chanting mantras following him during his excursions. In 918, a coup was launched against him. Kung was replaced by his general Wang Kŏn (also called Wang Geon), who restored the name Goryeo to the kingdom.

There then followed a protracted power struggle for control of the peninsula. Kyŏn Hwŏn attacked Gyeongju, the Silla capital, in 927.

=== Wang Geon&#x27;s unification of Korea ===
Later Baekje attacked the Silla kingdom in 920 and 924. Silla responded by calling on Later Goguryeo for assistance. When Baekje attacked and sacked the Silla capital of Gyeongju in 927, the Silla king Gyeongae of Silla (r. 924–927) was forced to commit suicide and a puppet ruler, Kim Pu installed in his place. Wang responded by attacking the Later Baekje capital. Kyŏn Hwŏn then lost a battle at Geochang to a force led by Wang. Back at the Baekje capital, Kyŏn Hwŏn faced a rebellion led by his son Kyŏn Sin-gŏm, who, displeased that his father had favoured his younger brother as next in line for the throne, imprisoned Kyŏn Hwŏn.

Wang was now in possession of most of Silla&#x27;s territory. His position as &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Korea was recognised by the Tang dynasty of China in 932. In 934, after Wang&#x27;s overwhelming victory over Baekje at Unju (Hongseong), refugees from the northern Manchurian state of Balhae (Parhae) felt the situation stable enough to return to Korea.

Gyeongsun of Silla surrendered and named Wang as his successor in 935. In that same year, Kyŏn, who had escaped to Later Goguryeo territory, appealed to his old enemy Wang for help to remove Kyŏn Sin-gŏm. Kyŏn led a Goguryeo army to Baekje, and the resulting civil war and death of both Kyŏn Sin-gŏm and Kyŏn Hwŏn in 936, greatly weakened Baekje and allowed Wang to finally unify the country once again under the name of Goryeo, origin of today&#x27;s name for Korea. Wang, posthumously given the title of Taejo of Goryeo or &#x27;Great Founder,&#x27; established a dynasty which would rule Korea for the next five centuries.

<text>Prijepolje (, ) is a town and municipality located in the Zlatibor District of southwestern Serbia. As of 2022, the town has 11,928 inhabitants, while the municipality has 32,214 inhabitants.

==Etymology==
One possible meaning of the name Prijepolje is &quot;Prija&#x27;s field&quot;, where Prija is the owner of &quot;polje&quot;, the &quot;field&quot; in English. However, a more likely theory is that the name originates from the location of Prijepolje and its relationship to the travels of caravans. When those caravans were passing through the area which would become Prijepolje, they would arrive at the settlement &quot;before the fields&quot;, where the present day neighborhoods of Ivanje and Velika Župa are located. &quot;Prije&quot; means &quot;before&quot;, and &quot;polje&quot; means &quot;field&quot;, hence, the location might be called Prijepolje. 

==Geography==
Prijepolje is located at the confluence of the fast-flowing Lim and Mileševka rivers. It is also situated along the road from Belgrade to the Adriatic Sea, as well as being a stop on the Belgrade – Bar railway. The Belgrade – Adriatic road intersects here with the regional road between Pljevlja, Prijepolje and Sjenica. This regional road follows roughly the same route as the ancient Roman road known as the Dubrovnik road. Just north of Prijepolje, at Bistrica, there is a road leading towards Priboj, Višegrad and Sarajevo. Prijepolje is surrounded by hills, such as Pušina, Srijeteži, Gradina and Sokolica, which, prior to the construction of the &quot;Potpeć&quot; hydro plant near Nova Varoš, created a unique climate around the municipality. Since the hydro plant&#x27;s construction, Prijepolje&#x27;s climate has been changed into one that is typical for this cold part of Serbia. The highest peak in the Prijepolje area is Katunić, which reaches 1,734 meters above sea level.

Forests surround most of Prijepolje, however, along the Lim, there are numerous beaches. Two of the most popular beaches are under bridges, one at the centre of the town, under the bridge in Ivanje, and another under the bridge in Petrovac. 

===Climate===
Prijepolje has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;), that&#x27;s very close to an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;).


==History==
Prijepolje was established as a settlement in 1234, the same year the Mileševa Monastery was built. Prior to its establishment as a settlement, the area was occupied as far back as the Stone Age. First settled by Illyrians, who migrated to the area after being forced out of the northern plains, they retreated to the more defensible and less accessible mountainous regions. Later arrivals were the Celts, with whom the Illyrians intermarried. With the arrival by the Romans, the Illyrians were again forced to flee, and after the Romans, the Slavs settled in the area, intermixing with some of the earlier Illyrians. The Goths, Huns, Gepids, Langobards and Avars also passed through this area. The most interesting archaeological site in the territory is the Roman necropolis near the modern settlement of Kolovrat where pieces of ancient glass, silver, ceramics, and gold have been unearthed.

Prijepolje was mentioned for the first time by &quot;Gijom Adam&quot; in 1332 while it was part of Dubrovnik&#x27;s sphere of influence. According to historical sources, Prijepolje developed as a road settlement for caravans along the route known as &quot;Dubrovnik&#x27;s road&quot;, a road connecting the central and eastern Balkans with the middle Adriatic coast. The caravan route traversed both mountainous and heavily forested areas, which could prove dangerous to travelers. Local villagers were tasked with protecting local roads, due to the statute which said, &quot;If, on the road, someone has been killed or has had a bullet stuck into his body, let the local guardians gather together to pay the damage. Hitting by one small drum, the passers by would know that there was no danger&quot;.

By 1477, part of the Albanian Mataruge tribe lived in the kaza of Prijepolje, where they formed their own distinct community (nahiye) with 10 villages (katund).
There was a cartographic reference to Prijepolje in &quot;Regno della Servia detta altrimentri Rascia&quot; by Giacomo Cantelli da Vignola, cartographer to the Duke of Modena, in 1689.

During the Ottoman period, there were quite a few buildings constructed in Prijepolje. Most famous of these are Ibrahim Pasha&#x27;s mosque and the Sahat Kula. Pasha&#x27;s mosque is located in Šarampov, one of three regions in town (the other two being Vakuf and the Town Center), and was most likely built in the 16th century. It is adorned with a single minaret, and covered by a &quot;cheramida&quot; (a special covering of the houses in that time). The region has a very tumultuous past. It was part of First Serbian revolt in 1875, known as Banine&#x27;s revolt, as well as seeing the Javorian War in 1876, the Raonić Revolt, the Balkan Wars in 1912 and 1913, and both World Wars. In 1912, during the First Balkan War, control of Prijepolje passed from the Ottoman Empire to the Kingdom of Montenegro.

During World War II, Prijepolje officially became part of the Kingdom of Montenegro, a pro-Axis puppet state. Prijepolje was liberated on 4 December 1943, which is now celebrated as the Day of the Liberation of Prijepolje.

<text>In complex analysis, the argument principle (or Cauchy&#x27;s argument principle) is a theorem relating the difference between the number of zeros and poles of a meromorphic function to a contour integral of the function&#x27;s logarithmic derivative.

==Formulation==

If &quot;f&quot; is a meromorphic function inside and on some closed contour &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; has no zeros or poles on &quot;C&quot;, then 
: formula_1
where &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;P&quot; denote respectively the number of zeros and poles of &quot;f&quot; inside the contour &quot;C&quot;, with each zero and pole counted as many times as its multiplicity and order, respectively, indicate. This statement of the theorem assumes that the contour &quot;C&quot; is simple, that is, without self-intersections, and that it is oriented counter-clockwise.

More generally, suppose that &quot;f&quot; is a meromorphic function on an open set Ω in the complex plane and that &quot;C&quot; is a closed curve in Ω which avoids all zeros and poles of &quot;f&quot; and is contractible to a point inside Ω. For each point &quot;z&quot; ∈ Ω, let &quot;n&quot;(&quot;C&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) be the winding number of &quot;C&quot; around &quot;z&quot;. Then
:formula_2
where the first summation is over all zeros &quot;a&quot; of &quot;f&quot; counted with their multiplicities, and the second summation is over the poles &quot;b&quot; of &quot;f&quot; counted with their orders.

==Interpretation of the contour integral==
The contour integral formula_3 can be interpreted as 2π&quot;i&quot; times the winding number of the path &quot;f&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) around the origin, using the substitution &quot;w&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;): 
:formula_4
That is, it is &quot;i&quot; times the total change in the argument of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) as &quot;z&quot; travels around &quot;C&quot;, explaining the name of the theorem; this follows from 
:formula_5 
and the relation between arguments and logarithms.

==Proof of the argument principle==
Let &quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot; be a zero of &quot;f&quot;. We can write &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;z&quot; − &quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot;)&quot;k&quot;&quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) where &quot;k&quot; is the multiplicity of the zero, and thus &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot;) ≠ 0. We get

: formula_6

and

: formula_7

Since &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot;) ≠ 0, it follows that &quot;g&#x27; &quot;(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has no singularities at &quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot;, and thus is analytic at &quot;z&quot;Z, which implies that the residue of &quot;f&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) at &quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot; is &quot;k&quot;.

Let &quot;z&quot;P be a pole of &quot;f&quot;. We can write &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;z&quot; − &quot;z&quot;P)−&quot;m&quot;&quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) where &quot;m&quot; is the order of the pole, and 
&quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;P) ≠ 0. Then,

: formula_8

and

: formula_9

similarly as above. It follows that &quot;h&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has no singularities at &quot;z&quot;P since &quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;P) ≠ 0 and thus it is analytic at &quot;z&quot;P. We find that the residue of
&quot;f&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) at &quot;z&quot;P is −&quot;m&quot;.

Putting these together, each zero &quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot; of multiplicity &quot;k&quot; of &quot;f&quot; creates a simple pole for
&quot;f&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with the residue being &quot;k&quot;, and each pole &quot;z&quot;P of order &quot;m&quot; of
&quot;f&quot; creates a simple pole for &quot;f&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) with the residue being −&quot;m&quot;. (Here, by a simple pole we
mean a pole of order one.) In addition, it can be shown that &quot;f&quot;′(&quot;z&quot;)/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) has no other poles,
and so no other residues.

By the residue theorem we have that the integral about &quot;C&quot; is the product of 2&quot;πi&quot; and the sum of the residues. Together, the sum of the &quot;k&quot;″s for each zero &quot;z&quot;&quot;Z&quot; is the number of zeros counting multiplicities of the zeros, and likewise for the poles, and so we have our result.

==Applications and consequences==
The argument principle can be used to efficiently locate zeros or poles of meromorphic functions on a computer. Even with rounding errors, the expression formula_10 will yield results close to an integer; by determining these integers for different contours &quot;C&quot; one can obtain information about the location of the zeros and poles. Numerical tests of the Riemann hypothesis use this technique to get an upper bound for the number of zeros of Riemann&#x27;s formula_11 function inside a rectangle intersecting the critical line. The argument principle can also be used to prove Rouché&#x27;s theorem, which can be used to bound the roots of polynomial roots.

A consequence of the more general formulation of the argument principle is that, under the same hypothesis, if &quot;g&quot; is an analytic function in Ω, then

:formula_12

For example, if &quot;f&quot; is a polynomial having zeros &quot;z&quot;1, ..., &quot;z&quot;p inside a simple contour &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;z&quot;k, then
:formula_13
is power sum symmetric polynomial of the roots of &quot;f&quot;.

Another consequence is if we compute the complex integral:

: formula_14

for an appropriate choice of &quot;g&quot; and &quot;f&quot; we have the Abel–Plana formula:

: formula_15

which expresses the relationship between a discrete sum and its integral.

The argument principle is also applied in control theory. In modern books on feedback control theory, it is commonly used as the theoretical foundation for the Nyquist stability criterion. Moreover, a more generalized form of the argument principle can be employed to derive Bode&#x27;s sensitivity integral and other related integral relationships.

==Generalized argument principle==
There is an immediate generalization of the argument principle. Suppose that g is analytic in the region formula_16. Then
: formula_17
where the first summation is again over all zeros &quot;a&quot; of &quot;f&quot; counted with their multiplicities, and the second summation is again over the poles &quot;b&quot; of &quot;f&quot; counted with their orders.

==History==
According to the book by Frank Smithies (&quot;Cauchy and the Creation of Complex Function Theory&quot;, Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 177), Augustin-Louis Cauchy presented a theorem similar to the above on 27 November 1831, during his self-imposed exile in Turin (then capital of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia) away from France. However, according to this book, only zeroes were mentioned, not poles. This theorem by Cauchy was only published many years later in 1874 in a hand-written form and so is quite difficult to read. Cauchy published a paper with a discussion on both zeroes and poles in 1855, two years before his death.

<text>Kubanskaya is a Russian, flavoured brand of vodka or nastoyka with a lemon flavour.

Kubanskaya was popular among expatriates living in Moscow during the 1990s. The 1998 Russian financial crisis triggered an exodus of the Moscow expatriates, and Kristall ceased production.

The vodka was mentioned in the novel &quot;Moscow-Petushki&quot;, and a song by the Zelenograd rock group NTO Retsept was called &quot;Kubanskaya&quot;.

<doc id="1138325" wikidata="Q435997" url="?curid=1138325" title="Margaret Preston">
<text>Margaret Rose Preston (29 April 1875 – 28 May 1963) was an Australian painter, printmaker and writer on art who is regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s leading modernists of the early 20th century. In her quest to foster an Australian &quot;national art&quot;, she was also one of the first non-Indigenous Australian artists to use Aboriginal motifs in her work. Her works are distinctively signed MP.

== Early life ==
Margaret Rose Preston was born on 29 April 1875 in Port Adelaide to David McPherson, a Scottish marine engineer, and Prudence Cleverdon McPherson, née Lyle. She was their first-born child; her sister Ethelwynne Lyle McPherson was born in 1877. The family called Margaret by her middle name (Rose), and it was only in her mid 30s that she began to use Margaret.

Preston&#x27;s family moved to Sydney in 1885, where Preston attended Fort Street Girls&#x27; High School for two years. She showed a very early interest in art, first with china painting and then through private art classes with William Lister Lister. Preston would later, at the age of 52, write about her childhood and developing interest in art in the article &quot;From Eggs to Electrolux,&quot; which ran in Sydney Ure Smith&#x27;s &quot;Art in Australia&quot; in 1927. Although written in the third person, it offers glimpses of her legendarily strong personality. She describes her first visit to the Art Gallery of New South Wales at the age of 12, recalling it as

:&quot;a big, quiet, nice smelling place with a lot of pictures hanging on the walls and here and there students sitting on high stools copying at easels. [My] first impression was not of the beauty of wonder of the pictures, but how nice it must be to sit on a high stool with people giving you &#x27;looks&#x27; as they went by... This visit led [me] to the decision to be an artist.&quot;

Following her classes with Lister, Preston went on to study at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School under Frederick McCubbin from 1889 to 1894. Her studies were interrupted for a time in 1894–95 by her father&#x27;s illness and death. When she returned to the school, she began working with Bernard Hall. She showed a strong preference for painting still lifes instead of people, and in 1897, she won the school&#x27;s Still Life Scholarship, which afforded her a year&#x27;s free tuition. In 1898, she transferred to Adelaide&#x27;s School of Design, where she studied under H. P. Gill and Hans Heysen.

== Teaching ==
Early in Preston&#x27;s career—especially before her marriage—she taught art to help support herself and her family. She began taking on private students while she was still at Adelaide&#x27;s School of Design, setting up her own studio in 1899. She later taught at St Peter&#x27;s College and at Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, both in Adelaide. Among her students were such notable artists as Bessie Davidson, Gladys Reynell, and Stella Bowen, who referred to her as &quot;a red-headed little firebrand of a woman, who was not only an excellent painter, but a most inspiring teacher&quot;. Gladys Reynell and Stella Bowen attended her classes in 1908.

== Art career ==

=== Traveling years (1904–1907; 1912) ===
After her mother died in 1903, Preston and Bessie Davidson
traveled to Europe, where they stayed from 1904 to 1907, with sojourns in Munich and Paris and shorter trips to Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, and Africa. In Munich, Preston briefly studied at the Government Art School for Women but was not taken with either German teaching methods or German aesthetics. She later commented, &quot;Half of German art is mad and vicious, and a good deal is dull.&quot;

Paris suited Preston better, and she took part in the Paris Salon of 1905 and 1906. Her developing Modernist sensibility was influenced by French Postimpressionists such as Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Henri Matisse as well as by Japanese art and design, which she encountered at the Musée Guimet. From Japanese art in particular she acquired a preference for asymmetrical composition, a focus on plants as subject matter, and an appreciation of pattern as an organizing method. She began to try to reduce her own work to &quot;decoration without ornamentation&quot;.

Returning to Australia in 1907, Preston leased a studio with Bessie Davidson, and they put on a joint exhibition from which one of her paintings &quot;Onions&quot; (1905), was bought by the National Gallery of South Australia. In 1911, Preston was asked to paint a portrait of Catherine Spence for the National Gallery of South Australia. Preston went back to France (Paris and Brittany) in 1912 with Gladys Reynell, but when World War I broke out, they moved to Great Britain. There Preston studied pottery and the principles of Modernist design at Roger Fry&#x27;s Omega Workshops. Later, she and Reynell taught pottery and basket-weaving as therapy for shell-shocked soldiers at the Seale Hayne Military Hospital in Devonshire. She exhibited her work in both London and Paris during this period.

From these European studies, Preston returned to Australia having adopted Modernist principles. The Modernists&#x27; analytical approach to design, sense of underlying form, and simplified pictorial space would all become hallmarks of her work. The influence of her European studies can be seen, for example, in her 1927 still life &quot;Implement Blue&quot;, with its geometric forms, muted palette, and stark lighting.

=== Early Mosman years (1919–1932) ===
In 1919, Preston went to America for an exhibition at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On her way back to Australia, she met her future husband, William George &quot;Bill&quot; Preston, a recently discharged second lieutenant of the Australian Imperial Force. She married her husband on 31 December 1919, and wrote a false birthdate on her marriage certificate to make herself eight years younger than her husband. Bill had a placid temperament that complemented Margaret Preston&#x27;s assertive personality, and they were devoted to each other throughout their marriage. Preston&#x27;s friend Leon Gellert noted that Bill seemed to regard it as a national duty to keep his beloved Margaret happy and artistically productive. A successful businessman, Bill Preston was a company director for Anthony Horderns retailers, Dalton&#x27;s packaging company and later, Tooheys Brewery. Their marriage gave Margaret the financial security to pursue her work and travel extensively.

The Prestons settled in the Sydney suburb of Mosman following their marriage in late December 1919. A harbour-side suburb, Mosman has long attracted artists and writers such as Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Harold Herbert, Dattilo Rubbo, Lloyd Rees, Nancy Borlase, and Ken Done. The Prestons would live in Mosman from 1920 to 1963, with the exception of seven years in the bush suburb of Berowra during the 1930s.
It was during the Mosman period that Preston became established as the most prominent Australian woman artist of the 1920s and 1930s. Within a year of the move to Mosman, the Art Gallery of New South Wales bought her 1915 painting &quot;Summer&quot;, at the 1920 Royal Art Society Spring exhibition. Preston was a founding member of the Contemporary Group in 1926. In 1929 the trustees of what is now the Art Gallery of New South Wales commissioned &quot;Self portrait&quot; (1930) – the first such commission to a woman artist from the Gallery. In the 1930s, she joined the Anthropological Society of New South Wales.

Preston joined the Society of Artists and became a friend of its president, Sydney Ure Smith, the influential editor and publisher of &quot;Art in Australia&quot;, &quot;The Home&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Writing in Ure Smith&#x27;s publications, Preston advocated for her own ideas about Australian art, especially the need to develop a national identity in art rather than endlessly imitating European models. She expressed these ideas in a 1925 article &#x27;The Indigenous Art of Australia&#x27; in &quot;Art in Australia,&quot; illustrated on the cover and accompanying the text with relief prints from indigenous designs, which she praises for their rhythm, adapted from aboriginal shields and taphoglyphs (elsewhere called dendroglyphs; carved wooden grave markers) and which she executed in coloured wool on hessian woolpack, though the article illustrations are her prints&quot;;&quot;&quot;In wishing to rid myself of the mannerisms of a country other than my own I have gone to the art of a people who had never seen or known anything different from themselves, and were accustomed always to use the same symbols to express themselves. These are the Australian aboriginals, and it is only from the art of such people in any land that a national art can spring.&quot;All told, she contributed several dozen articles on art to Ure Smith&#x27;s publications as well as to the Society of Artists yearbooks. Not only did Ure Smith give more space to Preston than to any other artist, he devoted three issues to her work exclusively: the Margaret Preston Number of &quot;Art in Australia&quot; (1927), &quot;Recent Paintings by Margaret Preston&quot; (1929), and &quot;Margaret Preston&#x27;s Monotypes&quot; (1949).

Preston also capitalized on the forum that women&#x27;s magazines provided in allowing her to reach a wide audience for both her work and her opinions on the future of Australian art. Readers of the April 1929 edition of &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; were prodded to keep the covers of issues on which Preston&#x27;s works had been reproduced and to frame them as pictures.

==== Prints ====
Even more than her paintings, Preston&#x27;s woodcuts, linocuts, and monotypes show her capacity for Modernist innovation. Although she had experimented with etching while living in England, the best of her mature work was in woodcuts. These prints were inexpensive to produce and helped her to extend her reach to a broader market.

Preston created over 400 known prints, not all of which are documented and some of which are lost. The great majority of surviving prints feature Australian native flora as their subjects, a result of Preston&#x27;s desire to make uniquely Australian images. Flowers such as the banksia, waratah, gum blossom and wheelflower offered Preston specimens for her radical, asymmetrical compositions.

Mosman and its environs also featured in many of Preston&#x27;s prints. One of the Prestons&#x27; flats (in Musgrave Street) afforded views of Mosman Bay and Mosman Bridge that turned up in more than half a dozen different prints. Another flat, near Reid Park, had views of Sydney Harbor and its foreshore that featured in such iconic works as &quot;Sydney Head I&quot; (1925), &quot;Sydney Head II&quot; (1925), and &quot;Harbour Foreshore&quot; (1925). The harbour also appears in the works &quot;Circular Quay&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Bridge from the North Shore&quot; (1932). There are also prints with landscape subjects, such as &quot;Red Cross Fete&quot; (1920)—a view across the water from Balmoral Island at night—and &quot;Edwards Beach Balmoral&quot; (1929) and &quot;Rocks and Waves&quot; (1929), which are both views from Wyargine Point near Edwards Beach.

Preston liked to experiment with new techniques, although her most usual approach was to print her images in black with added hand colouring. She felt that printmaking helped to keep her work fresh, writing: &quot;Whenever I thought I was slipping in my art, I went into crafts–woodcuts, monotypes, stencils and etchings. I find it clears my brain.&quot;

==== Paintings ====
Mosman also features in many Preston paintings that are not still life works. Two in particular—&quot;Japanese Submarine Exhibition&quot; (1942) and &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner at the Zoo&quot; (1944–46)—are painted in a deliberately naive style, reflecting a then-current interest in children&#x27;s art. Preston would probably have seen a 1939 Department of Education Gallery exhibition of children&#x27;s art, and she would have been aware of Roger Fry&#x27;s theories on creativity and learning in children. &quot;Japanese Submarine Exhibition&quot; offers a wry look at that paranoia and anti-Japanese sentiments of the war years in Australia.

=== Berowra years (1932–1939) ===
Between 1932 and 1939, the Prestons lived in the bush suburb of Berowra. While living in Berowra, the Prestons had two terrier dogs. It was here that Preston pursued most intensively her concern for the development of a national identity in Australian art. She continued her adaptations of Australian Indigenous art, deploying Aboriginal design motifs and natural-pigment colour schemes in her work. This tendency continued even after she left Berowra and can be seen in such later works such as &quot;The Brown Pot&quot; (1940) and &quot;Manly Pines&quot; (1953). Preston won a silver medal at the Exposition Internationale, Paris in 1937, and that year became a foundation member of, and exhibited with, Robert Menzies&#x27; anti-modernist organisation, the Australian Academy of Art.

=== Return to Mosman (1939–1963) ===
Following their seven years in Berowra, the Prestons returned to Mosman, where they would stay until Margaret Preston&#x27;s death on 28 May 1963. Among their homes during this period were the former home of actress Nellie Stewart and the Hotel Mosman. Preston&#x27;s later works built on the Aboriginal themes developed at Berowra, and her very last works had overtly religious themes, possibly in response to the Blake Prize instituted in 1951. In the 1950s, she made a series of gouache stencils based on religious subjects.

== Collections and exhibitions ==
A retrospective at the National Gallery of Australia, &quot;Margaret Preston, Australian printmaker&quot;, (December 2004 to April 2005), presented some of the gallery&#x27;s large collection of etchings, woodcuts, masonite cuts, monotypes and stencils by the artist. Other galleries that hold collections of her work include the Queensland Art Gallery, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of South Australia, and the National Gallery of Victoria.

In 2012, several works by Preston were included by curator Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev in documenta (13), Kassel, Germany.

In 2024, Geelong Gallery presented an exhibition examining the influence of ukiyo-e on Cressida Campbell and Preston. The exhibition took its lead from Geelong Gallery’s significant print holdings, chiefly Margaret Preston’s hand-coloured woodcut &quot;Fuchsia and balsam&quot; 1928 (purchased in 1982).

<text>Sir John Warcup Cornforth Jr., (7 September 1917 – 8 December 2013) was an AustralianBritish chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975 for his work on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalysed reactions, becoming the only Nobel laureate born in New South Wales.

Cornforth investigated enzymes that catalyse changes in organic compounds, the substrates, by taking the place of hydrogen atoms in a substrate&#x27;s chains and rings. In his syntheses and descriptions of the structure of various terpenes, olefins, and steroids, Cornforth determined specifically which cluster of hydrogen atoms in a substrate were replaced by an enzyme to effect a given change in the substrate, allowing him to detail the biosynthesis of cholesterol. For this work, he won a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975, alongside co-recipient Vladimir Prelog, and was knighted in 1977.

==Early life and family==
Born in Sydney, Cornforth was the son and the second of four children of English-born, Oxford-educated schoolmaster and teacher John Warcup Cornforth and Hilda Eipper (1887–1969), a granddaughter of pioneering missionary and Presbyterian minister Christopher Eipper. Before her marriage, Eipper had been a maternity nurse.

Cornforth was raised in Sydney as well as Armidale, in the north of New South Wales, where he undertook primary school education.

At about 10 years old, Cornforth had noted signs of deafness, which led to a diagnosis of otosclerosis, a disease of the middle ear which causes progressive hearing loss. This left him completely deaf by the age of 20 but also fatefully influenced his career direction away from law, his original intended field of study, and towards chemistry. In an interview with Sir Harry Kroto for the Vega Science Trust, Cornforth explained:I had to find something in which the loss of hearing would not be too severe a handicap...I chose chemistry...The most liberating thing was the realization that the literature wasn&#x27;t entirely correct. It gave me quite a shock at first, and then a thrill. Because I can set this right! And always, and ever since, I&#x27;ve relied upon the primary literature exclusively.

==Education==
Cornforth was educated at Sydney Boys&#x27; High School, where he excelled academically, passed tests in English, mathematics, science, French, Greek, and Latin, and was inspired by his chemistry teacher, Leonard (&quot;Len&quot;) Basser, to change his career directions from law to chemistry. Cornforth graduated as the dux of the class of 1933 at Sydney Boys&#x27; High School, at the age of 16.

In 1934, Cornforth matriculated and studied at the University of Sydney, where he studied organic chemistry at the University of Sydney&#x27;s School of Chemistry and from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science with First-Class Honours and the University Medal in 1937. During his studies, his hearing became progressively worse, thus making listening to lectures difficult. At the time, he could not use hearing aids as the sound became distorted, and he did not significantly use lip reading.

While studying at the University of Sydney, Cornforth met his future wife, fellow chemist and scientific collaborator, Rita Harradence. Harradence was a graduate of St George Girls High School and a distinguished academic achiever who had topped the state in Chemistry in the New South Wales Leaving Certificate Examination. Harradence graduated with a Bachelor of Science with First-Class Honours and the University Medal in Organic Chemistry in 1936, a year ahead of Cornforth. Harradence also graduated with a MSc in 1937, writing a master&#x27;s thesis titled &quot;Attempts to synthesise the pyridine analogue of vitamin B1&quot;.

In 1939, Cornforth and Harradence, independently of each other, each won one of two Science Research Scholarships (the 1851 Research Fellowship) from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, tenable overseas for two years. At the University of Oxford, Harradence was a member of Somerville College while Cornforth was at St. Catherine&#x27;s College and they worked with Sir Robert Robinson, with whom they collaborated for 14 years. During his time at Oxford, Cornforth found working for and with Robinson stimulating, and the two often deliberated to no end until one had a cogent case against the other&#x27;s counterargument. In 1941, Cornforth and Harradence both graduated with a D.Phil. in Organic Chemistry. At the time, there were no institutions or facilities at which a PhD in chemistry could be done in Australia.

==Career==
After his arrival at Oxford and during World War II, Cornforth significantly influenced the work on penicillin, particularly in purifying and concentrating it. Penicillin is usually very unstable in its crude form; as a consequence of this, researchers at the time were building upon Howard Florey&#x27;s work on the drug. In 1940, Cornforth and other chemists measured the yield of penicillin in arbitrary units to understand the conditions that favoured penicillin production and activity, and he contributed to the writing of &quot;The Chemistry of Penicillin&quot;.

In 1946, the Cornforths, who had by now married, left Oxford and joined the Medical Research Council (MRC), working at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), where they continued on earlier work in synthesising sterols, including cholesterol. The Cornforths&#x27; collaboration with Robinson continued and flourished. In 1951, they completed, simultaneously with Robert Burns Woodward, the first total synthesis of the non-aromatic steroids. At the NIMR, Cornforth collaborated with numerous biological scientists, including George Popják, with whom he shared an interest in cholesterol. Together, they received the Davy Medal in 1968 in recognition of their distinguished joint work on the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway to polyisoprenoids and steroids.

While working at the MRC, Cornforth was appointed a professor at the University of Warwick and was employed there from 1965 to 1971.

In 1975, Cornforth was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, alongside Vladimir Prelog. In his acceptance speech, Cornforth said:

Also in 1975, he moved to the University of Sussex in Brighton as a Royal Society Research Professor. Cornforth remained there as a professor and was active in research until his death.

==Personal life==
In 1941, the year in which they graduated from the University of Oxford, Cornforth married Rita Harriet Harradence (b. 1915), with whom he had one son, John, and two daughters, Brenda and Philippa. Cornforth had met Harradence after she had broken a Claisen flask in their second year at the University of Sydney; Cornforth, with his expertise of glassblowing and the use of a blowpipe, mended the break. Rita Cornforth died on 6 November 2012, at home with her family around her, following a long illness.

On an important author or paper that was integral to his success, Cornforth stated that he was particularly impressed by the works of German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer.

Cornforth died in Sussex on 8 December 2013. at the age of 96. Cornforth is survived by his three children and four grandchildren. He was a sceptic and an atheist.

==Honours and awards==
Cornforth was named the Australian of the Year in 1975, jointly with Maj. Gen. Alan Stretton. In 1977, Cornforth was recognised by his alma mater, the University of Sydney, with the award of an honorary Doctor of Science. Cornforth&#x27;s other awards and recognitions follow:

* Davy Medal (1968; jointly with George Joseph Popják)
* Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1953
* Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE; 1972)
* Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1975)
* Royal Medal (1976)
* Knight Bachelor (1977)
* Corresponding Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (1977)
* Foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1978)
* Copley Medal (1982)
* Companion of the Order of Australia (AC; 1991)
* Centenary Medal (2001)

Cornforth&#x27;s certificate of election for the Royal Society reads: 

==Popular culture==
Cornforth was the focus of a skit on an episode of &quot;Comedy Inc&quot;., whereby a fictional &quot;Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?&quot; contestant (played by Genevieve Morris) is asked &quot;Which Australian scientist won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1975?&quot; for the million-dollar question. As it happens, the contestant gleefully claims they are second cousins with Cornforth (despite being nearly 50 years his junior) and knows Cornforth is the answer, confidently rattling off a bunch of highly specific and esoteric facts about Cornforth&#x27;s life and achievements, all the while the host (a satirical portrayal of Eddie McGuire) stubbornly and continuously stalls her for dramatic effect, asking her for several minutes if she&#x27;d like to think about it more to an absurd degree.

On September 7, 2017, Google celebrated his 100th birthday with a Google Doodle.

The Royal Australian Chemical Institute (RACI) honours Cornforth by naming its prize for the best PhD thesis in chemical science completed at an Australian university the Cornforth Medal.

<text>Carlos Schwabe (born Émile Martin Charles Schwabe; 21 July 1866 – 22 January 1926) was a Swiss Symbolist painter and printmaker.

== Life ==

Schwabe was born in Altona, Holstein into a merchant family. In 1870 his family moved to Switzerland, receiving Swiss citizenship in 1888. Between the years of 1882 to 1884, he studied at the École des arts industriels.

After studying art in Geneva, he relocated to Paris as a young man, where he worked as a wallpaper designer, and he became acquainted with Symbolist artists, musicians (Guillaume Lekeu, Vincent d&#x27;Indy) and writers. In 1892, he was one of the painters of the famous &quot;Salon de la Rose + Croix&quot; organized by Joséphin Péladan at the Galerie Durand-Ruel. His poster for the first Salon is an important symbolic work of idealist new art. He exhibited at the Société nationale des Beaux-Arts, at the Salon d&#x27;automne and was present at the Exposition Universelle of 1900, receiving the Gold medal. In the years that followed his work was also shown in Munich, Zürich, Vienna, and Brussels. Schwabe received the French Légion of Honor in 1902.

Schwabe&#x27;s paintings typically featured mythological and allegorical themes, with a very personal and idealist vision and social interest. References to the artists Albrecht Dürer and Andrea Mantegna can be seen in Schwabe&#x27;s work.

Schwabe is known for being one of the most important symbolist book illustrators. He illustrated the novel &quot;Le rêve&quot; (1892) by Émile Zola, Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; (1900), Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1892), and Albert Samain&#x27;s &quot;Jardin de l&#x27;infante&quot; (1908), but also texts by Haraucourt, Mallarmé, Blondel, Mendès, Lamennais, etc. His important work &quot;La Vague&quot; (The Wave) and its preparatory drawings are a testimony of the engagement of the artist during the Dreyfus affair.

The most important works by Schwabe belong to the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, the Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire in Geneva, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels and in private collections.

Schwabe lived in France for the rest of his life and died in Avon, Seine-et-Marne in 1926.

==Work==
Two distinct styles are recognized in Schwabe&#x27;s art. Before 1900, Schwabe&#x27;s paintings were more individual and experimental, indicating the idealism of the Symbolists; conventional, allegorical scenes from nature became more prominent in his later work. Images of women were important, sometimes representing death and suffering, other times creativity and guidance. His first wife was his model for angels and virgins, and &quot;Death&quot; in &quot;&quot; (1895) resembles her. The death of a close friend in 1894, the musician Guillaume Lekeu, when Schwabe was 28 years old, engendered his interest in representing death and the world of ideal creation.

Schwabe created an important watercolor that was the model of a lithographic poster for the 1892 &quot;Salon de la Rose + Croix&quot;, the first of six exhibitions organized by Joséphin Péladan that demonstrated the Rosicrucian tendencies of French Symbolism. Schwabe&#x27;s poster depicted in shades of blue an initiation rite—three women ascending toward spiritual salvation—and is an exemplar of Rosicrucian art.

<doc id="1138351" wikidata="Q1674974" url="?curid=1138351" title="Isuzu Piazza">
<text>The Isuzu Piazza is a small, sporty 3-door liftback coupé which was manufactured by Isuzu from 1981 until 1992 in two generations. The Isuzu Piazza was marketed as the Isuzu Impulse in North America and as the Holden Piazza in Australia.

The first generation Piazza was a rear-wheel drive car, and in the United Kingdom it was the first widely available Isuzu passenger car. The second generation was available as front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. It was the basis for the lower-priced Gemini Coupé, known as the Geo Storm in the US market.

As of 2010, the number of registered Impulses in North America totaled only 2,300, making Impulses very rare.


== First generation (JR120/130; 1980) ==

In 1978, Isuzu commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro to design a new sporty car to replace the 117 Coupe (also a Giugiaro design). They delivered several T Series Chevettes (developed in 1973 in South America) to the Italdesign studio in Italy and allowed Giugiaro free rein over the design. The result of this effort was the wedge-shaped three-door hatchback called the &quot;Asso di Fiori&quot; (&quot;Ace of Clubs&quot;) prototype and show car. It was shown at the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show to rave reviews. Giugiaro referred to the design as his fifth &quot;Copernican revolution&quot;, integrating the design innovations of many different previous designs into one, mass producible, vehicle. Within 48 hours of its unveiling at the Tokyo Motor Show, Isuzu fast tracked the vehicle into production with minimal changes to the design. Items that remained were the single blade front windshield wiper, and an integrated steering wheel adjustment that also moved the instrument cluster, with wiper controls and exterior lighting controls installed just behind the steering wheel on either side, a feature that later appeared on the Ford Probe.

The first Piazza rolled off the production line in September 1980 in Fujisawa, Japan, available with either , 2.0 L SOHC inline-four MPFI engine, a carryover from the Isuzu 117 Coupé, or a , 2.0 L DOHC MPFI I4 engine. Five-speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions were available, and all models were rear-wheel drive. In April 1984, a , turbocharged SOHC I4 engine was introduced, and the DOHC naturally aspirated engine was phased out in years that followed. Piazzas were available in a multitude of trim levels including Bella, XN, XJ, XE, XG, Nero, and others. There were three different suspension tuning levels, standard, Irmscher, and Lotus. Production continued through 1990.

===United States===
For the US market, this vehicle was introduced as the Impulse in 1983. For the 1983 and 1984 model years, only one engine was available, the 2.0 L SOHC inline-four engine, rated at , . A MPFI turbocharged model was introduced in 1985, with a 2.0 L SOHC engine rated at and . The 1987 model year had the RS model which came with a 4ZC1 turbo engine. The 1988 model year saw several changes. Mild exterior and interior changes were made to the appearance of the vehicle (including a larger rear spoiler and fixed headlights without pop up covers).

The 2.0 L non-turbo engine was replaced with a 2.3-liter version, rated at and of torque. The 2.3 L engine was offered only in the US market, because the larger engine would have obligated Japanese consumers to pay more annual road tax, thereby affecting sales, as well as the larger engine conflicted with Japanese government regulations concerning maximum displacement for cars classified as &quot;compact&quot;. All Impulses received a Lotus-tuned suspension beginning in the 1988 model year, which consisted of redesigned sway bars, stiffer dampers, and a change in previous spring rates.

In the US market, the Impulse was marketed as &quot;everything standard&quot;, meaning that all Impulses came with all available equipment for the vehicle&#x27;s model year, and only two trim levels offered: non-turbo and Turbo. There were, however, some special edition models, most notably the RS model of the 1987 model year, available only in white body color with pewter color trim, and featuring the stiffest suspension available on any Impulse, very close to the Irmscher suspension sold only in Japan. For the 1989 model year, a Special Edition non-turbo model was offered which was equipped with the Turbo model wheels and interior trim.

Performance of the Turbo model was comparable to the Mitsubishi Starion/Dodge Conquest, as demonstrated by the fact that the acceleration and handling numbers reported by the auto enthusiast magazines were within 0.1–0.2 seconds between the vehicles.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the Piazza was introduced in 1985 and sold in only one trim level, available only with a 147 bhp 2.0 turbocharged engine (4ZC1-T).

The Piazza had a shaky start in the UK with the first importer Isuzu GB, based in Maidstone, Kent going out of business in 1986, and London car dealer Alan Day bought the remaining stock of Piazzas at a bargain price. These cars were sold by Alan Day at significantly reduced price; the main reason Isuzu GB went out of business was due to high unit price. In 1987 International Motors Group of West Bromwich (IM Group) were awarded the official Isuzu franchise for the UK. (They also at the time represented Subaru and Hyundai in the UK.) IM Group still marketed the Piazza in single trim/engine form, but they only sold the updated &#x27;Lotus&#x27; Piazza. The earlier cars sold by Day became known as &#x27;pre-Lotus&#x27; cars; the suspension and handling of these pre-Lotus cars was derided by UK Press as poor, especially the live axle arrangement at the rear, which by the late &#x27;80s was seen to be antiquated. The updated &#x27;Handling by Lotus&#x27; car was available from 1987 and the handling, although keeping the live axle arrangement, was transformed by Lotus in the UK after significant development work, involving modified suspension layouts, larger brakes, specially produced dampers and Goodyear tyres. The &#x27;Handling by Lotus&#x27; cars had updated interior and exterior equipment. The exterior having a redesigned rear, with a large &#x27;hoop&#x27; spoiler, new rear lamps, new rear badging with &#x27;Handling by Lotus&#x27; badges and removal of the rubber side bumper strakes for a cleaner, more modern look. The updated interior trim was mainly &#x27;tweed&#x27; check fabric, an updated centre console, but the loss of air conditioning to keep the price down for the UK market.

Isuzu (UK) Ltd, the West Bromwich-based importer, sold the Lotus Piazza from 1987 to 1989, before concentrating on the 4WD Isuzu Trooper. They never sold the second generation Piazza in the UK, or in any other European market.

===Australia===

In Australia, the Piazza was introduced very late (April 1986), and offered only in Turbo form. It was badged as a Holden Piazza. The first generation Piazza was replaced by the Opel Vectra-based Holden Calibra in Australia.

== Second generation (JT22; 1990) ==
The second generation Piazza/Impulse was designed on General Motors&#x27;s second generation R-body &quot;world car&quot; platform. GM had commissioned Isuzu to build a replacement for the Spectrum, this time including a sportier model called the Storm (Gemini Coupé in Japan). The body design of the Storm was strongly influenced by GM and drew heavily from GM Europe&#x27;s design submission for the Lotus Elan M100. Under Shiro Nakamura, Isuzu&#x27;s then head of design, the third generation Gemini sedan was first designed on this platform, and then attention was turned to a sporty coupé to replace the first generation Impulse. Starting with the Storm, alternative front and rear treatments were made, retaining the &quot;capsule&quot; theme of the Gemini sedan, and drawing heavy influence from the rear-wheel drive Impulse (semi-concealed headlights with integrated grille as well as hood and taillight styling) while also expanding on the &quot;European look&quot;, which later became a central point of marketing the vehicle in Japan.

In the United States, the three-door hatchback debuted as the Impulse XS in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It was offered only in front-wheel drive with a DOHC 1.6 L (1588 cc) inline-four engine which produced 130 hp (97 kW) and 102 lb·ft (138 Nm). The suspension consisted of MacPherson struts both front and rear, with a rigid trailing arm front suspension and a multi-link rear suspension, featuring Nishiboric passive steering. Because of labor shortages in Japan, however, the car was only ready for press introductions in March 1990 and went on sale shortly thereafter.

For the 1991 model year, the Impulse RS was introduced with a and 150 lb·ft (203 Nm) turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive drivetrain which featured rear viscous differential and center planetary differential and viscous coupling. The wagonback model was also introduced for the 1991 model year, only available with the normally aspirated 1.6 L engine.

For the 1992 model year, the Turbo model was discontinued and the base engine was replaced with a 1.8 L (1809 cc) engine, sharing the same bore but with a longer stroke due to the taller engine block. This larger powerplant was good for and 125 lb·ft (169 Nm). Both body styles continued into 1992, but very few were produced.

The second generation Impulse was produced in very low numbers, totaling slightly over 13,000 units, with that number including the production of the Isuzu Stylus. General Motors, who owned nearly half of Isuzu, also owned Lotus Cars at the time. Lotus selected the 1.6-litre engine and transmission from the Isuzu Gemini for the Lotus Elan M100 and a following generation of that engine eventually ended up in the Impulse. Lotus was subcontracted by Isuzu to fine-tune the suspension of the Impulse, through selection of stiffer dampers, larger sway bars, and softer springs. All of the second generation Impulses had the Lotus-tuned suspension.

A non-Lotus innovation in the Impulse was the development of the Nishiboric passive rear-wheel steering system which adjusted the toe of the rear wheels by changing the rear wheel alignment through the range of suspension travel.

The combination of the burst of the Japanese economic bubble, rising emissions and crash safety requirements, and continued restrictive market segment changes by General Motors forced Isuzu out of the car making market and brought an end to the Impulse.

In the Japanese market, this vehicle was sold as the Piazza from July 1991 through the spring of 1992. The second generation Piazza was offered only in front-wheel drive with the 1.8 L engine. All of the second generation Piazzas came with the Lotus-tuned suspension. The Japanese were also offered the Geo Storm version of the Piazza, called the Piazza PA-Nero. This model was exclusive to the Japanese import dealership network Yanase Co., Ltd., under a special arrangement that sold GM products in Japan.

In Canada, the same models, with minor variations, were sold in the 1990 and 1991 model years. No Impulses were made for Canada for the 1992 model year. In 1993 the 1.8 L model was sold in Canada as the Asüna Sunfire, but only with the hatchback body. With the phaseout of the Asüna brand in 1993, the Sunfire name moved to a Pontiac, as its version of the third-generation Chevrolet Cavalier on the GM J platform rather than an Isuzu platform.

<text>Tusculum is a ruined Roman city in the Alban Hills, in the Latium region of Italy. Tusculum was most famous in Roman times for the many great and luxurious patrician country villas sited close to the city, yet a comfortable distance from Rome, notably the villas of Cicero and Lucullus.

==Location==
Tusculum is located on Tuscolo hill on the northern edge of the outer crater rim of the Alban volcano. The volcano itself is located in the Alban Hills south of the present-day town of Frascati.

The summit of the hill is above sea level and affords a view of the Roman Campagna, with Rome lying to the north-west. It had a strategic position controlling the route from the territory of the Aequi and the Volsci to Rome which was important in earlier times.

Later Rome was reached by the Via Latina (from which a branch road ascended to Tusculum, while the main road passed through the valley to the south of it), or by the Via Labicana to the north.

Most of the ancient city and the acropolis and amphitheatre have not yet been excavated archaeologically.

==History==

===Antiquity===

According to legend, the city was founded either by Telegonus, the son of Odysseus and Circe, or by the Latin king Latinus Silvius, a descendant of Aeneas, who according to Titus Livius was the founder of most of the towns and cities in Latium. The geographer Filippo Cluverio discounts these legends, asserting that the city was founded by Latins about three hundred years before the Trojan War. Funerary urns datable to the 8th–7th centuries BC demonstrate a human presence in the late phases of Latin culture in this area.

Tusculum is first mentioned in history as an independent city-state with a king, a constitution and gods of its own. When Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last King of Rome, was expelled from the city in 509 BC, he sought military help from Lars Porsenna, king of Clusium. After the war between Clusium and Rome, Porsenna made a peace with Romans, and Tarquinius failed to win back his throne. Subsequently, he sought refuge with his son-in-law Octavius Mamilius, one of the leading men of Tusculum. The Mamilii claimed to be descended from Telegonus, the founder of the city. Mamilius commanded the army of the Latins against the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus, where he was killed in 498 BC. This is the point at which Rome gained predominance among the Latin cities.

The city walls can be dated between the 5th and 4th c. BC from the type and technique of construction, as visible on the North slope of the hill.

According to some accounts Tusculum subsequently became an ally of Rome, incurring the frequent hostilities of the other Latin cities. In 460 BC a Sabine named Appius Herdonius occupied the Capitol. Of the Latin cities, only Tusculum quickly sent troops, commanded by the dictator Lucius Mamilius, to help the Romans. Together with the forces of the consul Publius Valerius Poplicola they were able to quash the revolt.

In 458 BC the Aequi attacked Tusculum and captured its citadel. Because of the assistance given Rome the previous year, the Romans came to their defense, and helped regain the citadel, with soldiers under the command of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, who defeated the Aequi at the battle of Mount Algidus.
===Roman Republic and Empire===

In 381 BC, after an expression of complete submission to Rome, the people of Tusculum received a franchise from Rome. Tusculum became the first &quot;municipium cum suffragio&quot;, or self-governing city. The Tusculum citizens were therefore recorded in the &quot;Tribus Papiria&quot;.
Other accounts, however, speak of Tusculum as often allied with Rome&#x27;s enemies, the last being the Samnites in 323 BC.

In Sulla&#x27;s civil war Tusculum supported the Marians but after Sulla&#x27;s victory in 82 BC it became a &quot;colonia&quot; and parts of the city wall were rebuilt.

In 54 BC, in his &quot;Orationes Pro Cn. Plancio&quot;, Marcus Tullius Cicero said: &quot;You are from the most ancient municipium of Tusculum, from which so many consular families are originating, among which even the gens Iuventia—all other municipia (together) do not have so many (consular families) coming from them&quot;.

Varro wrote about the laws of Tusculum in &quot;De Lingua Latina&quot;, Volume 5: &quot;New wine shall not be taken into the town before the Vinalia are proclaimed&quot;.

The town council kept the name of senate, but the title of dictator gave place to that of &quot;aedile&quot;. Notwithstanding this, and the fact that a special college of Roman equites was formed to take charge of the cults of the gods at Tusculum, and especially of the Dioscuri, the citizens resident there were neither numerous nor men of distinction.

In Roman times the city had expanded into two parts: the acropolis with the temples of the Dioscuri and Jupiter Maius, and the main city along the ridge of the hill where the main street passes through the forum to the theatre.

The villas of the neighbourhood, of which 36 owners are recorded in the Republican era and 131 villa sites identified, had indeed acquired greater importance than the town itself, which was not easily accessible. By the end of the Republic, and still more during the imperial period, the territory of Tusculum was a favorite place of residence for wealthy Romans. Seneca wrote: &quot;Nobody who wants to acquire a home in Tusculum or Tibur for health reasons or as a summer residence, will calculate how much yearly payments are&quot;.

In 45 BC Cicero wrote a series of books in his Roman villa in Tusculum, the Tusculanae Quaestiones. In his times there were eighteen owners of villas there. 
An example is the so-called villa of Lucullus, which later belonged to Flavia gens, which was built in terraces on the slope of Tusculum facing Rome: the vast terrace now houses virtually all the historical centre of Frascati.

Much of the territory (including Cicero&#x27;s villa), but not the town itself, which lies far too high, was supplied with water by the Aqua Crabra.

The last archaeological evidence of Roman Tusculum is a bronze tablet of 406 AD commemorating Anicius Probus Consul and his sister Anicia.

===Middle Ages===

From the 5th to the 10th century there are no historical mentions of Tusculum. In the 10th century it was the base of the Counts of Tusculum, an important family in the medieval history of Rome. They were a clan system whose first mentioned member is Theophylact I (died 924). His daughter Marozia married Alberic I, Marquis of Spoleto and Camerino, and was for a while the arbiter of political and religious affairs in Rome—a position which the Counts held for a long period of time. They were pro-Byzantine and against the German Emperors. From their clan came several Popes in the period between 914 and 1049.

Gregory I of Tusculum rebuilt the fortress on the Tuscolo hill, and gave as a gift the &quot;Criptaferrata&quot; to Saint Nilus the Younger, where the latter built a famous abbey. Gregory also headed the rebellion of the Roman people of 1001 against the German Emperor Otto III.

After 1049 the Counts of Tusculum Papacy declined as the particular &quot;formula&quot; of the papacy-family became outdated. Subsequent events from 1062 confirmed the change of the Counts&#x27; politics, which became pro-Emperor in opposition to the Commune of Rome. Tusculum had in this time several notable guests: Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and his wife Empress Agnes in 1046, the Pope Eugene III from 1149, Louis VII of France and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1149, Frederick Barbarossa and the English Pope Adrian IV in 1155.

In 1167 the Roman communal army attacked Tusculum (Battle of Monte Porzio), but it was defeated by the Emperor-allied army, headed by Christian I, Archbishop of Mainz; in the summer of the same year, however, a plague decimated the imperial army and Frederick Barbarossa was forced to return to Germany.

===Destruction and rediscovery===
===Medieval destruction===
From 1167 the residents of Tusculum moved to the neighbours (Locus) or little villages as Monte Porzio Catone, Grottaferrata and mostly to Frascati: only a little group of defence troops remained in the old city.

When in 1183 the Roman army again attacked Tusculum, Barbarossa sent a new of troops to its defence. The Commune of Rome was however able to destroy the town on 17 April 1191 with the consent of Pope Celestine III and the consent of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, son of Frederick Barbarossa.

Roger of Hoveden wrote &quot;lapis supra lapidem non remansit&quot; (not a stone upon a stone remained), indeed the Roman Commune&#x27;s army took away the stones of the walls of Tusculum as spoils of war in Rome.

After destruction the land of Tusculum city became woodland and pasture lands. The buildings destroyed in Tusculum became a big open quarry of materials for the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns of the Alban Hills.

===Remains and archeology===
In 1806 the first campaign of archaeological excavation on the top of the Tuscolo hill was begun by Lucien Bonaparte. In 1825 the archaeologist Luigi Biondi excavated to find out Tusculum, engaged by Queen Maria Cristina of Bourbon, wife of Charles Felix of Sardinia. In 1839 and 1840 the architect and archaeologist Luigi Canina, called by the same royal family, excavated the Theatre area of Tusculum. The ancient works of art excavated were sent to Savoy Castle of Agliè in Piedmont.

In 1825 Lucien Bonaparte found the so-called Tusculum portrait of Julius Caesar at the city&#x27;s forum.

In 1890 Thomas Ashby arrived to Rome as Director of the British School in Rome. He was an expert in ancient monuments topography and studied the Tusculum monuments, reporting the results in &quot;The Roman Campagna in Classical Times&quot; published in London in 1927. Earlier, he had described the remains thus in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:

On the hill of Tusculum itself are remains of a small theatre (excavated in 1839), with a reservoir behind it, and an amphitheatre. Both belong probably to the imperial period, and so does a very large villa (the substructures of which are preserved), by some attributed to Cicero, by others to Tiberius, near the latter. Between the amphitheatre and the theatre is the site of the Forum, of which nothing is now visible, and to the south on a projecting spur were tombs of the Roman period. There are also many remains of houses and villas.

The citadel—which stood on the highest point an abrupt rock—was approached only on one side, that towards the city, and even here by a steep ascent of 150 feet. Upon it remains of the medieval castle, which stood here until 1191, alone are visible. The city walls, of which some remains still exist below the theatre, are built of blocks of the native &quot;lapis Albanus&quot;, or . They probably belong to the Republican period. Below them is a well-house, with a roof formed of a pointed arch.

Cicero&#x27;s favourite residence and retreat for study and literary work was at, or near, Tusculum. It was here that he composed his celebrated Tusculan Disputations and other philosophical works. According to various parts of his works that it was a considerable building. It comprised two gymnasia with covered portions for exercise and philosophical discussion (Tusc. Disp. ii. 3). One of these, which stood on higher ground, was called the &quot;Lyceum,&quot; and contained a library; the other, on a lower site, shaded by rows of trees, was called the &quot;Academy.&quot; The main building contained a covered portion, or cloister, with recesses containing seats. It also had bathrooms, and contained a number of works of art, both pictures and statues in bronze and marble. The cost of this and the other house which he built at Pompeii led to him being burdened with debt.

===Modern archeology===

In 1955 and 1956 the archaeologist Maurizio Borda excavated a necropolis with cinerary urns.

From 1994 to 1999 was held the last excavation campaigns of archaeologist Xavier Dupré and his staff undertaken by Escuela Espanola de Historia y Arqueologia en Roma.


==Main sights==

The Roman theatre on the hill of Tuscolo and the Villa of Tiberius were excavated between 1825 and 1841 and are now accessible.

In the High Middle Ages, there were three churches in Tusculum: St. Saviour and Holy Trinity &quot;in civitate&quot;, and St. Thomas on the acropolis. The Greek monastery of St. Agatha lay at the foot of the Tuscolo hill, at the 15th mile of the Via Latina road, the old &quot;Statio Roboraria&quot; : it was founded in 370 AD by the basilian monk John of Cappadocia, a disciple of St. Basil of Caesarea, called St. Basil the Great. He brought here a relic of the master, handed it over to him by monk Gregory Nazianzus. Saint Nilus the Younger died in this Greek monastery on 27 December 1005.

The Portrait of &quot;Madonna del Tuscolo&quot;, placed nowadays in a little aedicule on the Tuscolo hill, is a reproduction in ceramic of an earlier original icon from Tusculum, spoil of war, which now is in the Abbey of St. Mary in Grottaferrata.

In the extra-urban area located south of the city, between it and the Via Latina, there is archeological evidence of burials in the place of a medieval church already in ruin after 1191 and dating to the 13th century, found by the last archeological excavation (1999).

The cross of Tusculum there was already in 1840, as reported by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, rector of the English College. In October, 1864 the students of the English College rebuilt the plinth of foundation of the old cross. Now on the top of the Tuscolo hill is an altar and an iron cross 19 metres (62,33 ft) high. The height of cross underlines the fact that it was built 19 centuries after the death of Jesus Christ.

== Quotes ==
Strabo wrote about Tusculum in his &quot;Geography&quot;, V 3 § 12.:

But still closer to Rome than the mountainous country where these cities lie, there is another ridge, which leaves a valley (the valley near Algidum) between them and is high as far as Mount Albanus. It is on this chain that Tusculum is situated, a city with no mean equipment of buildings; and it is adorned by the plantings and villas encircling it, and particularly by those that extend below the city in the general direction of the city of Rome; for here Tusculum is a fertile and well-watered hill, which in many places rises gently into crests and admits of magnificently devised royal palaces.

<text>Valentín González González (4 November 1904 – 20 October 1983), popularly known as El Campesino (the Peasant), was a Spanish Republican military commander during the Spanish Civil War.

== Life ==

=== Spanish Civil War ===
Born in Malcocinado, Badajoz, González worked as a miner and was a member of the Communist Party, establishing one of the first militia units to counter Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalist Army upon the outbreak of the Civil War. As a brigade commander, González personally took part in all of the major actions that occurred during the Nationalists&#x27; assault on Madrid in 1936. He also commanded formations during the battles of the Corunna Road (December 1936), the Jarama, and Guadalajara (March 1937).

In the summer of 1937, he led the 46th Division in the Battle of Brunete. Heavily promoted as a heroic figure by Soviet propaganda, González was accused by other officers in the Ejercito Popular of being brutal in his treatment of his men, unsuited for modern battle, and an egomaniac.

He led his men in the Battle of Belchite, the Battle of Teruel, and Catalonia. After the Nationalist victory in 1939, he emigrated to the Soviet Union.

=== Soviet Union ===
Along with other exiled Spanish Republican commanders, he was enrolled in the Frunze Military Academy but was expelled for incompetence. He was later imprisoned in Vorkutlag Gulag labor camp with other Spanish Communists. There he worked as a brigadier of miners. The Soviets transferred him to other camps. In 1949 he escaped from Soviet Union to Iran.

In 1951 he published an autobiography, &quot;Vida y muerte en la URSS&quot;.
After the Spanish transition to democracy in 1978, he returned to Spain. He died in Madrid.

<doc id="1138373" wikidata="Q2483432" url="?curid=1138373" title="Ficciones">
<text>(in English: &quot;Fictions&quot;) is a collection of short stories by Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges, originally written and published in Spanish between 1941 and 1956. Thirteen stories from &quot;Ficciones&quot; were first published by New Directions in the English-language anthology &quot;Labyrinths&quot; (1962). In the same year, Grove Press published the entirety of the book in English using the same title as in the original language. &quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot; originally appeared published in &quot;A History of Eternity&quot; (&quot;&quot;) (1936). &quot;Ficciones&quot; became Borges&#x27;s most famous book and made him known worldwide.

The book is dedicated to writer Esther Zemborain de Torres Duggan, a friend and collaborator of Borges&#x27;s.

==Background==

===Publication===
In 1941, Borges&#x27;s second collection of fiction, &#x27; (English:&quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;) was published. It contained eight stories. In 1944, a new section labeled &#x27; (&quot;Artifices&quot;), containing six stories, was added to the eight of &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;. These were given the collective title &quot;Ficciones&quot;. Borges added three more stories to the &quot;Artifices&quot; section in the 1956 edition.

===Translation===
In 1948, the story &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; was translated into English by Anthony Boucher and published in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.

In 1962, an English translation of &quot;Ficciones&quot; was published by Grove Press. Edited and introduced by Anthony Kerrigan, the other translators were Anthony Bonner, Alastair Reid, Helen Temple, and Ruthven Todd.

==Style==
&quot;Ficciones&quot; emphasizes and calls attention to its fictional nature. The choice and use of literary devices are conspicuous in the stories. Naomi Lindstrom explains that Borges saw an effort to make a story appear natural &quot;as an impoverishment of fiction&#x27;s possibilities and falsification of its artistic character.&quot;

==Themes==
The labyrinth is a recurring motif throughout the stories. It is used as a metaphor to represent a variety of things: the overwhelmingly complex nature of worlds and the systems that exist on them, human enterprises, the physical and mental aspects of humans, and abstract concepts such as time. The stories of Borges can be seen as a type of labyrinth themselves.

Borges often gives his first-person narrators the name &quot;Borges.&quot; While he imparts many of his own characteristics in them, he does not idealize them, and gives them human failings as well.

Borges often puts his protagonists in red enclosures. This has led to analysis of his stories from a Freudian viewpoint, although Borges himself strongly disliked his work being interpreted in such a way. In fact, he called psychoanalysis (Obra poética, Prólogo) &quot;la triste mitología de nuestro tiempo&quot;, or &quot;the sad mythology of our time&quot;.

Borges loved books and gives detailed descriptions of the characteristics of the fictional texts in his stories. In &quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot;, he indirectly suggests that a librarian is even holier than a saint.

Other themes throughout his stories include: philosophical issues; deterioration and ruination; games of strategy and chance; conspiracies and secret societies; and ethnic groups, especially those in his own ancestry.

<text>The Second Battle of Fallujah, initially codenamed Operation Phantom Fury, Operation al-Fajr (, ) was an American-led offensive of the Iraq War that began on 7 November 2004 and lasted about six weeks. 

A joint military effort of the United States, the Iraqi Interim Government, and the United Kingdom, the battle was the war&#x27;s first major engagement fought solely against the Iraqi insurgency, not the military forces of the Ba&#x27;athist Iraq government. 

Operation Phantom Fury took place seven months after the First Battle of Fallujah, an attempt to capture or kill insurgent elements involved in the 2004 Fallujah ambush that killed four employees of the private military contractor Blackwater. After that battle, control of the city was transferred to an Iraqi-run local security force, which began stockpiling weapons and building complex defenses. 

Led by the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army, the Second Battle of Fallujah was later described as &quot;some of the heaviest urban combat Marines and Soldiers have been involved in since Huế City in Vietnam in 1968&quot; and as the toughest battle the U.S. military has been in since the end of the Vietnam War. It was the single bloodiest and fiercest battle of the entire conflict, including for American troops.

==Background==
In February 2004, control of Fallujah and the surrounding area in the Al Anbar Governorate was transferred from the United States 82nd Airborne Division to the 1st Marine Division. Shortly afterward, on 31 March 2004, four American private military contractors from Blackwater – Wesley Batalona, Scott Helvenston, Jerry Zovko, and Michael Teague – were ambushed and killed in the city. Images of their mutilated bodies were broadcast around the world. Journalist Jeremy Scahill later called this incident the Mogadishu moment of the Iraq War (referencing the Battle of Mogadishu, also known as the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; incident). Although tactical commanders in Iraq considered these deaths militarily insignificant, U.S. political leaders disapproved of a measured approach targeting the perpetrators and instead requested a larger assault into the city. A leak later revealed that the main factor behind this wasn&#x27;t the killings themselves, but the circulation of images of the event which served as a symbol of opposition to American forces in Iraq.

Within days, U.S. Marine Corps forces launched Operation Vigilant Resolve (5 April 2004) to take back control of the city from insurgent forces. On 28 April 2004, Operation Vigilant Resolve ended with an agreement where the local population was ordered to keep the insurgents out of the city. The Fallujah Brigade, composed of local Iraqis under the command of a former Ba&#x27;athist officer named Muhammed Latif, took control of the city.

Insurgent strength and control began to grow to such an extent that by 24 September 2004, a senior U.S. official told ABC News that catching Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said to be in Fallujah, was now &quot;the highest priority,&quot; and estimated his troops at 5,000 men, mostly non-Iraqis. However, the stated purpose of the military operation in Fallujah was to weaken the insurgency in preparation for the planned Iraqi elections in January 2005.

==Preparations==
===Coalition forces===
Before beginning their attack, U.S. and Iraqi forces had established checkpoints around the city to prevent anyone from entering, and to intercept insurgents attempting to flee. In addition, overhead imagery was used to prepare maps of the city for use by the attackers. American units were augmented by Iraqi interpreters to assist them in the planned fight. After weeks of withstanding air strikes and artillery bombardment, the militants in the city appeared to be vulnerable to direct attack.

U.S., Iraqi and British forces totaled about 13,500. The U.S. had gathered some 6,500 Marines and 1,500 Army soldiers that would take part in the assault with about 2,500 Navy personnel in operational and support roles. U.S. troops were grouped in two Regimental Combat Teams: Regimental Combat Team 1 comprised 3rd Battalion/1st Marines, 3rd Battalion/5th Marines, and U.S. Army 2d Battalion/7th Cavalry. Regimental Combat Team 7 comprised the 1st Battalion/8th Marines, 1st Battalion/3rd Marines, U.S. Army 2d Battalion/2d Infantry, 2d Battalion/12th Cavalry About 2,000 Iraqi troops assisted with the assault. All were supported by Marine fixed and rotary-winged aircraft, Navy and Air Force fixed-wing aircraft; and USSOCOM Sniper Elements.

The 850-strong 1st Battalion of the Black Watch was ordered to help U.S. and Iraqi forces with the encirclement of Fallujah. As part of Task Force Black, D Squadron of the British SAS prepared to take part in the operation, but British political nervousness about the possible scale of casualties stopped any direct UK involvement in the ground battle.

===Insurgent forces===
In April, Fallujah was occupied by about 500 &quot;hardcore&quot; and 1,000+ &quot;part time&quot; insurgents. By November, it was estimated that the numbers had doubled. Another estimate put the number of insurgents at 3,000; however, a number of insurgent leaders escaped before the attack.

Fallujah was occupied by virtually every insurgent group in Iraq: al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), Islamic Army of Iraq (IAI), Ansar al-Sunna, Army of Mohammed (AOM), the Army of the Mujahedeen and the Secret Islamic Army of Iraq. Three groups, (AQI, IAI and the National Islamic Army (1920 Revolution Brigade)) had their nationwide headquarters in Fallujah. An estimated 2,000 insurgents were from the Army of Mohammed (made up of ex Fedayeen Saddam fighters), Ansar al-Sunna and various smaller Iraqi groups.

Unlike what most cities in Iraq saw, the Battle of Fallujah did not have internal disputes between insurgents. The fighters consisted of both Sunnis and Shi&#x27;as; Soldiers of the Mahdi army fought alongside Sunni and Ba&#x27;athist groups against the United States.
The Iraqi insurgents and foreign Mujahideen present in the city prepared fortified defenses in advance of the anticipated attack. They dug tunnels, trenches, prepared spider holes, and built and hid a wide variety of IEDs. In some locations, they filled the interiors of darkened homes with large numbers of propane bottles, large drums of gasoline, and ordinance, all wired to a remote trigger that could be set off by an insurgent when troops entered the building. They blocked streets with Jersey barriers and even emplaced them within homes to create strong points behind which they could attack unsuspecting troops entering the building. Insurgents were equipped with a variety of advanced small arms, and had captured a variety of U.S. armament, including M14s, M16s, body armor, uniforms and helmets.

They booby-trapped buildings and vehicles, including wiring doors and windows to grenades and other ordnance. Anticipating U.S. tactics to seize the roofs of high buildings, they bricked up stairwells to the roofs of many buildings, creating paths into prepared fields of fire which they hoped the troops would enter.

Intelligence briefings given prior to battle reported that coalition forces would encounter Chechen, Filipino, Saudi, Libyan, and Syrian combatants, as well as native Iraqis.

===Civilian presence===
Most of Fallujah&#x27;s civilian population fled the city before the battle, which greatly reduced the potential for noncombatant casualties. U.S. military officials estimated that 70–90% of the 300,000 civilians in the city fled before the attack, leaving 30,000 to 90,000 civilians still in the city. The military used leaflets and broadcasts to encourage civilians to leave the city before the assault. However, multiple news agencies reported that military-aged males were prevented from leaving or entering the city by the U.S. military. Additionally, not all civilians had the means to leave Fallujah before the battle. Jane Arraf, who was embedded with U.S. troops, said that some families wrote &quot;We are family&quot; on the doors of their homes, hoping the Marines would not attack during the battle.

==Battle==
===Diversion===
With Navy SEAL and Marine Recon Snipers providing reconnaissance and target marking on the city perimeter, ground operations began on the night of 7 November 2004. Attacking from the west and south, the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion with their U.S. Army Special Forces advisers, 1st and 2nd Platoon Charlie Company, Manchu 1st Battalion 9th Infantry Regiment Mechanized, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division (U.S. Army) served as the main effort on the peninsula and supported by 3rd Platoon Alpha Company 2/72nd Tank Battalion (U.S. Army), and 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, reinforced by Bravo Company from the Marine Corps Reserve&#x27;s 1st Battalion, 23rd Regiment, and supported by Combat Service Support Company 122.

2nd Infantry Division, Manchu, Charlie Co 1-9 Infantry Mechanized with 1st and 2nd platoons, (US Army) SEAL Sniper Task Elements from Naval Special Warfare Task Group Central and the U.S. Marine Corps Scout Platoons, captured Fallujah General Hospital, Blackwater Bridge, ING building, and villages opposite of the Euphrates River along Fallujah&#x27;s western edge. Marines from 1/3 fired 81mm mortars in an operation in south Fallujah. The same unit then moved to the western approaches to the city and secured the Jurf Kas Sukr Bridge. These initial attacks, however, were a diversion intended to distract and confuse insurgents holding the city, preceding the all-out offensive. Two Marines died in the initial attacks when their bulldozer fell into the Euphrates River. 42 insurgents were killed along the Fallujah riverside.

===Main attack===

After Navy Seabees from I MEF Engineer Group (MEG) and Army Civil Affairs soldiers interrupted and disabled electrical power at two substations located just northeast and northwest of the city, two Marine Regimental Combat Teams, Regimental Combat Team 1 (RCT-1) and Regimental Combat Team 7 (RCT-7) launched an attack along the northern edge of the city. They were joined by two U.S. Army heavy battalion mechanized units, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and Task Force 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment (Mechanized), followed by four Marine infantry battalions tasked with clearing buildings. The Army&#x27;s mechanized Second Brigade, First Cavalry Division, Marines&#x27; 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion and A. Co 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, was tasked with infiltrating the city and destroying any fleeing enemy forces. The British Army&#x27;s 1st Battalion, The Black Watch, patrolled the main highways to the east. The RCTs were augmented by three 7-man SEAL Sniper Teams from Naval Special Warfare Task Group-Central and one platoon from 1st Recon, who provided advance reconnaissance in the city, Joint Terminal Aircraft Control (JTAC) and unilateral overwatch throughout the operation. The United States Air Force provided close air support for the ground offensive, employing F-15 Strike Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, B-52 Stratofortresses, and AC-130 gunships to carry out close-quarter precision airstrikes against enemy strongholds within the city. The Air Force also employed MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance and precision strikes, and the U-2 Dragon Lady high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft for intelligence collection, surveillance and reconnaissance before, during, and after the battle.
The six battalions of U.S. and Iraqi forces, aided by Marine Corps Scout and Target Acquisition, SEAL Sniper, and JTAC elements pre-fire operations, moved into the city under the cover of darkness; and once aligned with the reconnaissance elements, began the assault in the early hours of 8 November 2004, preceded by an intense artillery barrage firing some 2500 155mm projectiles and air attack. This was followed by an attack on the main train station, which was then used as a staging point for follow-on forces. By that afternoon, under the protection of intense air cover, Marines entered the Hay Naib al-Dubat and al-Naziza districts. The Marines were followed by the Navy Seabees of NMCB 4 and NMCB 23 who bulldozed the streets clear of debris from the bombardment that morning. The Seabees used armored bulldozers to plow the streets while remaining safe and protected from enemy fire. Shortly after nightfall on 9 November 2004, Marines had reportedly reached Phase Line Fran at Highway 10 in the center of the city.
While most of the fighting subsided by 13 November 2004, U.S. Marines and Special Operations Forces continued to face determined isolated resistance from insurgents hidden throughout the city. By 16 November 2004, after nine days of fighting, the Marine command described the action as mopping up pockets of resistance. Sporadic fighting continued until 23 December 2004.

By late January 2005, news reports indicated U.S. combat units were leaving the area, and were assisting the local population in returning to the now heavily damaged city.

===Combat awards===

Staff Sergeant David Bellavia of the Army Task Force 2-2 Infantry was awarded the Medal of Honor.

*Naval Special Warfare Task Group-Central

==Aftermath==

The battle proved to be the bloodiest of the war and the bloodiest battle involving U.S. Marines since the Vietnam War. Comparisons with the Battle of Hue City and the Pacific campaign of World War II were made. Coalition forces suffered a total of 107 killed and 613 wounded during Operation Phantom Fury. U.S. forces had 54 killed and 425 wounded in the initial attack in November. By 23 December when the operation was officially concluded, the casualty number had risen to 95 killed and 560 wounded. British forces had 4 killed and 10 wounded in two separate attacks in the outskirts of Fallujah. Iraqi forces suffered 8 killed and 43 wounded. Estimates of insurgent casualties are complicated by a lack of official figures. Most estimates place the number of insurgents killed at around 1,200 to 1,500, with some estimations as high as over 2,000 killed. Coalition forces also captured approximately 1,500 insurgents during the operation.

The 1st Marine Division fired a total of 5,685 high-explosive 155mm artillery rounds during the battle. The 3rd Marine Air Wing (aviation assets only) expended 318 precision bombs, 391 rockets and missiles, and 93,000 machine gun and cannon rounds.

Fallujah suffered extensive damage to residences, mosques, city services, and businesses. The city, once referred to as the &quot;City of Mosques&quot;, had over 200 mosques prior to the battle; approximately 60 were destroyed in the fighting. Many of these mosques had been used as arms caches and weapon strongpoints by Islamist forces. Of the roughly 50,000 buildings in Fallujah, between 7,000 and 10,000 were estimated to have been destroyed in the offensive and from half to two-thirds of the remaining buildings had notable damage.

While pre-offensive inhabitant figures are unreliable, the nominal population was assumed to have been 200,000–350,000. One report states that both offensives, Operation Vigilant Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury, created 200,000 internally displaced persons who are still living elsewhere in Iraq. While damage to mosques was heavy, coalition forces reported that 66 out of the city&#x27;s 133 mosques had been found to be holding significant amounts of insurgent weaponry.
In mid-December, residents were allowed to return after undergoing biometric identification, provided they wore their ID cards all the time. Reconstruction progressed slowly and mainly consisted of clearing rubble from heavily damaged areas and reestablishing basic utilities. Only 10% of the pre-offensive inhabitants had returned as of mid-January, and only 30% as of the end of March 2005.

Nevertheless, the battle proved to be less than the decisive engagement that the U.S. military had hoped for. Some of the nonlocal insurgents, along with Zarqawi, were believed to have fled before the military assault, leaving mostly local militants behind. Subsequent U.S. military operations against insurgent positions were ineffective at drawing out insurgents into another open battle, and by September 2006, the situation had deteriorated to the point that the Al-Anbar province that contained Fallujah was reported to be in total insurgent control by the U.S. Marine Corps, with the exception of only pacified Fallujah, but now with an insurgent-plagued Ramadi.

After the U.S. military operation of November 2004, the number of insurgent attacks gradually increased in and around the city, and although news reports were often few and far between, several reports of IED attacks on Iraqi troops were reported in the press. Most notable of these attacks was a suicide car bomb attack on 23 June 2005 on a convoy that killed 6 Marines. Thirteen other Marines were injured in the attack. However, fourteen months later insurgents were again able to operate in large numbers.

A third push was mounted from September 2006 and lasted until mid-January 2007. Tactics developed in what has been called the &quot;Third Battle of Fallujah,&quot; when applied on a larger scale in Ramadi and the surrounding area, led to what became known as &quot;the Great Sunni Awakening.&quot; After four years of bitter fighting, Fallujah was turned over to the Iraqi Forces and the Iraqi Provincial Authority during the autumn of 2007.

Al Qaeda-linked Sunni insurgents from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant subsequently took over Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in early 2014 and the city was reclaimed by the Iraqi Army and Special Operations Units in June 2016.

==Criticisms==
There were numerous criticisms relating to the United States&#x27; tactics during the battle, including the weapons used, civilian casualties, and collateral damage.
===Use of white phosphorus as a weapon===
The use of white phosphorus during the battle was first reported on November 10, 2004, by &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporters who were embedded with Task Force 2-2, Regimental Combat Team 7 reported that they witnessed artillery guns firing white phosphorus projectiles which &quot;create a screen of fire that cannot be extinguished with water. Insurgents reported being attacked with a substance that melted their skin, a reaction consistent with white phosphorous burns.&quot; The article also reported, &quot;The corpses of the mujaheddin which we received were burned, and some corpses were melted.&quot;

On November 8, 2005, the national public broadcasting company of Italy, Radiotelevisione Italiana S.p.A. aired a documentary titled &quot;Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre&quot;, which reported that the United States had used white phosphorus as a weapon in Fallujah, and which showed that insurgents and civilians had been killed or injured by chemical burns. Included were graphic video and photos of severe and deep chemical burns that penetrated the flesh and bones of men, women, and children. The filmmakers claimed that the United States used incendiary MK-77 bombs in violation of Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, a convention to which the United States was not a party until 2009.

According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, quoted in the documentary, white phosphorus is permitted for use as an illumination device and as a weapon with regard to heat energy, but not permitted as an offensive weapon with regard to its chemical properties.

On November 15, 2005, the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, Robert Tuttle, wrote to &quot;The Independent&quot; denying that the United States used white phosphorus as a weapon in Fallujah. However, later the same day, US Department of Defense spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Barry Venable confirmed to the BBC that US forces had used white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon there. Venable also stated &quot;When you have enemy forces that are in covered positions that your high explosive artillery rounds are not having an impact on and you wish to get them out of those positions, one technique is to fire a white phosphorus round into the position because the combined effects of the fire and smoke – and in some case the terror brought about by the explosion on the ground – will drive them out of the holes so that you can kill them with high explosives.&quot;

On November 16, 2005, BBC News reported that an article published in the March–April 2005 issue of &quot;Field Artillery&quot;, a U.S. Army magazine, noted that white phosphorus had been used during the battle. According to the article, &quot;WP (White Phosphorus) proved to be an effective and versatile munition. We used it for screening missions at two breeches and, later in the fight, as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes where we could not get effects on them with HE [High Explosives]. We fired &quot;shake and bake&quot; missions at the insurgents, using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out.&quot;

===Killing of wounded===
On 16 November 2004, NBC News aired footage that showed a U.S. Marine killing a wounded Iraqi fighter. In this video, the Marine was heard saying that the Iraqi was &quot;playing possum&quot;. NCIS investigators later determined that the Marine was acting in self-defense.

===Prevention of military-age males from fleeing Fallujah===
Agence France-Presse (AFP) and other news agencies reported that military-age males, 15 to 50 years old, were prevented from leaving the city before the battle began by the U.S. military. All entrances to the city were controlled by U.S. forces.

The Guardian&#x27;s George Monbiot wrote:
===Civilian casualties===

The Red Cross estimated directly following the battle that some 800 civilians had been killed during the offensive. The Iraq Body Count project reported between 581 and 670 civilian deaths resulting from the battle. Mike Marqusee, in a November 2005 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote that &quot;The US claims that 2,000 died, most of them fighters. Other sources disagree. When medical teams arrived in January they collected more than 700 bodies in only one third of the city. Iraqi NGOs and medical workers estimate between 4,000 and 6,000 dead, mostly civilians&quot;.

===Depleted uranium===
US forces used depleted uranium (DU) shells during the battle. Depleted uranium shells use very dense and non-fissile (but still radioactive) uranium left over from enrichment, for effective armor penetration. They also disperse DU dust into the environment during impact. A July 2009 paper by Buzby &quot;et al.&quot; reported a high level of cancer, birth defects and infant mortality, according to a house-to-house survey in Fallujah. A 2011 study of elemental contaminants in the hair of parents children with abnormalities, by Alaani &quot;et al.&quot;, concludes &quot;these findings suggest the enriched Uranium exposure is either a primary cause or related to the cause of the congenital anomaly and cancer increases.&quot; A 2012 journal article by Al-Hadithi &quot;et al.&quot;, says existing studies and research evidence do not show a &quot;clear increase in birth defects&quot; or a &quot;clear indication of a possible environmental exposure including depleted uranium&quot;. The article says &quot;there is actually no substantial evidence that genetic defects can arise from parental exposure to DU in any circumstances.&quot; The results of a 2010 study at Fallujah General Hospital, published in 2012, concluded that, &quot;the higher rates of congenital anomalies are believed to be caused by exposure to some genotoxic agent, possibly uranium.&quot;

<text>Major General Alan Bishop Stretton, (30 September 1922 – 26 October 2012) was a senior Australian Army officer. He came to public prominence through his work in charge of cleanup efforts at Darwin in the aftermath of Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Day 1974. As head of the National Disasters Organisation he managed the evacuation of 35,000 people in six days, including loading a jumbo jet with 673 passengers, mostly children, then a record for the most people aloft in the one aircraft.

==Early years==
Stretton was born on 30 September 1922 in Melbourne, Victoria. He was educated at Caulfield Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne. After graduating from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, he began his military career serving with the 2/9th Battalion during the Second World War.

==Football==
In 1946 and 1947 Stretton played 16 games of Australian rules football in the Victorian Football League with St Kilda, after arriving at the club from Duntroon.

==Military career==
Stretton served in the army from 1940 to 1978. In the Second World War he served as a platoon commander in the 2/9th Battalion.

In the Korean War he served in the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment from 1954 to 1955. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire on 13 December 1955. In Malaya he served as the commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1961–63). On 12 June 1965 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He served three tours during the Vietnam War, in 1962, 1966 and 1967. He was Director of administrative planning at headquarters (1966–69), and from 1969 to 1970 was chief of staff of the Australian forces. On 8 January 1971 he was advanced to Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his service in Vietnam. In 1970 the South Vietnamese government awarded him the Distinguished Service Order and in 1973 the US awarded him the Bronze Star Medal.

During his time in Malaya and Vietnam, without attending a lecture, he studied by correspondence from the jungle and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Queensland in 1966. He was admitted as a barrister in the New South Wales and High Courts in 1969.

Stretton was promoted to brigadier in 1971 and from 1972 to 1974 was deputy director (military) of the Joint Intelligence Organisation and member of the National Intelligence Committee.

==Cyclone Tracy and post-military==
Stretton was jointly named the 1975 Australian of the Year, with Sir John Cornforth.
He wrote &quot;The Furious Days: The Relief of Darwin&quot; (1976) and &quot;Soldier in the Storm&quot; (1978), retiring from public life in 1978. He practiced law in Canberra into his 70s.

In 1999, in only his second visit to the city of Darwin since Cyclone Tracy, he presented his insignia as Officer of the Order of Australia, and his award as Australian of the Year, to the people of Darwin.

In 2003 he publicly criticised the Australian Government&#x27;s policy of involvement with the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, in an open letter in which he stated: &quot;The alleged connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qa&#x27;ida is ludicrous.&quot;

He died on 26 October 2012 at Batemans Bay Hospital in New South Wales, aged 90.

<text>Nora Roberts (born Eleanor Marie Robertson on October 10, 1950) is an American author of over 225 novels, known for romance published under her own name. She also writes police procedurals which have elements of science fiction under the name J. D. Robb, and has published as Jill March, and (in the U.K.) Sarah Hardesty.

== Life and career ==

=== Personal life ===

==== Early years ====
Roberts was born on October 10, 1950, in Silver Spring, Maryland, the youngest of five children. Her parents have Irish ancestry, and she has described herself as &quot;an Irishwoman through and through&quot;. Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life. Although she had always imagined stories from childhood, Roberts did not write in her youth other than essays for school. She does claim to have &quot;told lies. Really good ones—some of which my mother still believes.&quot; She credits the nuns at her Catholic school for instilling in her a sense of discipline.

==== Marriages ====
During her second year in high school, Roberts transferred to Montgomery Blair High School, where she met her first husband, Ronald Aufdem-Brinke. They married, against her parents&#x27; wishes, in 1968, as soon as she graduated, and settled in Boonsboro, Maryland.

Roberts&#x27; husband worked at his father&#x27;s sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts would later refer to this time period as her &quot;Earth Mother&quot; years, when she did crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children&#x27;s clothes. The couple divorced in 1983.

Roberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985. Her husband owns Turn the Page Books bookstore in Boonsboro and works as an adult content photographer and videographer. The couple also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel. After it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008, it was restored and reopened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.

She is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times.

=== Writing career ===
She began to write during a blizzard in February 1979. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten for her two boys, she had little else to do. She fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts which she submitted to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,

I got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey.

Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts&#x27; work.

Roberts once stated: &quot;You&#x27;re going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.&quot; She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. Roberts then goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the &quot;texture and color&quot; of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.

She often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters. In the past, her trilogies were all released in paperback, as Roberts believed the wait for hardcover editions was too long for the reader. All her new publications are released in hardcover first and e-book, with paperback editions following.

Roberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying.

=== Pseudonyms ===

==== Nora Roberts ====
In 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette Books, formed to take advantage of the manuscripts from the American writers that Harlequin had rejected. Roberts&#x27; first novel, &quot;Irish Thoroughbred&quot;, was published in 1981, using the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.

Between 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette, published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA&#x27;s reissue program. In 1985, &quot;Playing the Odds,&quot; the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published and was an immediate bestseller.

In 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers and original paperbacks, reaching the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Montana Sky&quot;. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she &quot;[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.&quot;

Roberts was featured in Pamela Regis&#x27; &quot;A Natural History of the Romance Novel.&quot; Regis calls Roberts &quot;a master of the romance novel form&quot;, because she &quot;has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; once talked about her &quot;wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities&quot; in the romance novel genre.

==== J. D. Robb ====
Roberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance while she built a following of readers. After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts&#x27;s prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so they would be able to publish more of her work each year.

Her agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense under the new name. She chose the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, discovered it was in use by another author. Instead, her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials &quot;J. D.&quot; were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while &quot;Robb&quot; is a shortened form of Roberts.

As J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the &quot;in Death&quot; series, feature detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke. When the &quot;in Death&quot; series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.

After publishing 18 novels in the &quot;in Death&quot; series, Putnam published the nineteenth, &quot;Divided in Death&quot;, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts&#x27; first bestselling novel of 2004.

As of March 2022, Roberts has published 54 novels plus ten novellas in the &quot;in Death&quot; series.

==== Other pseudonyms ====
Roberts wrote a story for a magazine titled &quot;Melodies of Love&quot; under the pseudonym Jill March. She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty in the UK. When the &quot;Born In&quot; series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.

=== Success ===
In 1996, Roberts passed the hundred-novel mark with &quot;Montana Sky&quot; and, in 2012, doubled that with &quot;The Witness&quot;. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that &quot;USA Today&quot; listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list came in 1991, and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; bestseller list, as her romance &quot;Time and Again&quot; was number one, and her J.D. Robb release &quot;Seduction in Death&quot; was number two.

Since 1999, every one of Roberts&#x27;s novels has been a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and 124 of her novels have ranked on the &quot;Times&quot; bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts&#x27;s novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400 million copies of her books are in print, including 12 million copies sold in 2005 alone. Her novels have been published in 35 countries.

A founding member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award. As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA&#x27;s RITA Awards, the highest honor given in the romance genre.

Two of Roberts&#x27; novels, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Magic Moments&quot;, had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: &quot;Angels Fall&quot; starring Heather Locklear, &quot;Montana Sky&quot; starring Ashley Williams, &quot;Blue Smoke&quot; starring Alicia Witt, and &quot;Carolina Moon&quot; starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author. Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included &quot;Northern Lights&quot; starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, &quot;Midnight Bayou&quot; starring Jerry O&#x27;Connell, &quot;High Noon&quot; starring Emilie de Ravin, and &quot;Tribute&quot; starring Brittany Murphy.

&quot;TIME&quot; named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she &quot;has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.&quot; Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell.

=== Victim of plagiarism ===
In 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts&#x27; work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts&#x27; &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; and Dailey&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot; back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism &quot;mind-boggling&quot;, Roberts sued Dailey. Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both &quot;Aspen Gold&quot; and &quot;Notorious&quot; lifted heavily from Roberts&#x27; work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey&#x27;s admission. In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).

Roberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.

In 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.

== Charity ==
Roberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund&#x27;s annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation. The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts. The Foundation also endowed the Nora Roberts Center for American Romance at McDaniel College, which supports academic scholarship on the American romance novel, with special emphasis on the literary qualities and significance of the romance.

<text>A bindi (from Sanskrit &quot;bindú&quot; meaning &quot;point, drop, dot or small particle&quot;) is a coloured dot or, in modern times, a sticker worn on the centre of the forehead, originally by Hindus, Jains and Buddhists from the Indian subcontinent.

A bindi is a bright dot of some colour applied in the centre of the forehead close to the eyebrows or in the middle of the forehead that is worn in the Indian subcontinent (particularly amongst Hindus in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka) and Southeast Asia among Balinese, Javanese, Sundanese, Malaysian, Singaporean, Vietnamese, and Myanmar Hindus. A similar marking is also worn by babies and children in China and, as in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, represents the opening of the third eye. In Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism the bindi is associated with the ajna chakra, and Bindu is known as the third eye chakra. Bindu is the point or dot around which the mandala is created, representing the universe. The bindi has a religious, historical and cultural presence in the region of India and with the Hindu, Indian diaspora around the world.

==Religious significance==

Traditionally, the area between the eyebrows (where the bindi is placed) is said to be the sixth chakra, &quot;ajna&quot;, the seat of &quot;concealed wisdom&quot;. The bindi is said to retain energy and strengthen concentration. The bindi also represents the third eye. 
The Nasadiya Sukta of the Rig Veda, the earliest known Sanskrit text, mentions the word &quot;Bindu&quot;.

The Ajna is symbolised by a sacred lotus with two petals, and corresponds to the colours violet, indigo or deep blue, though it is traditionally described as white. It is at this point that the two sides Nadi Ida (yoga) and Pingala are said to terminate and merge with the central channel Sushumna, signifying the end of duality, the characteristic of being dual (e.g. &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;, or &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;). The seed syllable for this chakra is the syllable OM, and the presiding deity is Ardhanarishvara, who is a half male, half female Shiva/Shakti. The Shakti goddess of Ajna is called Hakini. In metaphysics, Bindu is considered the dot or point at which creation begins and may become unity. It is also described as &quot;the sacred symbol of the cosmos in its unmanifested state&quot;. Bindu is the point around which the mandala is created, representing the universe. Ajna&#x27;s key issues involve balancing the higher and lower selves and trusting inner guidance. Ajna&#x27;s inner aspect relates to the access of intuition. Mentally, Ajna deals with visual consciousness. Emotionally, Ajna deals with clarity on an intuitive level.

In Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, bindi is associated with Ajna Chakra and Bindu. Divinities in these religions are typically depicted with &quot;Bhrumadhya Bindu&quot;, in meditative pose with their eyes nearly closed show the gaze focused between eyebrows, other spot being the tip of the nose—Naasikagra. The very spot between the eyebrows known as Bhrumadhya is where one focuses one&#x27;s sight, so that it helps concentration. 

The bindi has multiple meanings:
* Archaeology has yielded clay female figurines from the Indus Valley with red pigment on the forehead and hair parting. It is unclear whether this held any religious or cultural significance.
* In Hinduism, the colour red represents honour, love, and prosperity, hence bindis are worn to symbolise these qualities after marriage in particular.
* In meditation, the point between the eyebrows (Bhrumadhya) is where one focuses one&#x27;s sight, to help concentration. Most images of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divinities in meditative poses with their eyes nearly closed show the gaze focused between the eyebrows (another spot being the tip of the nose—naasikagra)
* Swami Muktananda writes that &quot;auspicious Kumkuma or sandalwood paste is applied (between the eyebrows) out of respect for the inner Guru. It is the Guru&#x27;s seat. There is a chakra (centre of spiritual energy within the human body) here called Ajna chakra, meaning &#x27;Command centre&#x27;. Here is received the Guru&#x27;s command to go higher in Sadhana (spiritual practice) to the &#x27;Sahasraar&#x27; (seventh and final chakra) which leads to Self-realisation. The flame seen at the eyebrow is called &#x27;Guru Jyoti&#x27;.&quot;
* The encyclopaedic &quot;Dictionary of Yoga&quot; reports that this &#x27;Ajna Chakra&#x27; is also called the &#x27;Third eye&#x27;. This centre is connected with the sacred syllable &#x27;Om&#x27; and presiding, is &#x27;Parashiva&#x27;. On activating this centre, the aspirant overcomes &#x27;Ahankāra&#x27; (the ego or sense of individuality), the last stop on the path of spirituality.

Despite having a strong religious origin and significance, some Muslim women from South Asia choose to wear the bindi as a fashion accessory. The Islamic Research Foundation, located in India, has had to state &quot;wearing a bindi or mangalsutra is a sign of Hindu women. The traditional bindi still represents and preserves the symbolic significance that is integrated into Indian mythology in many parts of India.&quot;

==Traditional application method==

A traditional bindi is red or maroon in colour. A pinch of vermilion powder is applied with a ring-finger to make a dot. A small annular disc aids application for beginners. First, a sticky wax paste is applied through the empty centre of the disc. This is then covered with kumkum or vermilion and then the disc is removed to get a round bindi. Various materials such as lac, sandal, &#x27;aguru&#x27;, mica, &#x27;kasturi&#x27;, kumkum (made of red turmeric) and sindoor colour the dot. Saffron ground together with &#x27;kusumba&#x27; flower can also work. Traditionally they are green in colour with a red dot in the middle. The bindi is no longer restricted in colour or shape.
Historically, the ornamental bindi spangle consists of a small piece of lac over which is smeared vermilion, while above it a piece of mica or thin glass is fixed for ornament. Women wore large spangles set in gold with a border of jewels if they could afford it. The bindi was made and sold by lac workers known as Lakhera. In Hinduism, it&#x27;s part of the &quot;Suhāg&quot; or &quot;lucky trousseau&quot; at marriages and is affixed to the girl&#x27;s forehead on her wedding and thereafter always worn. Unmarried girls optionally wore small ornamental spangles on their foreheads. A widow was not allowed to wear bindi or any ornamentation associated with married women. In modern times, self-adhesive bindis are available in various materials, usually made of felt or thin metal and adhesive on the other side. These are simple to apply, disposable substitutes for older lac tikli bindis. Sticker bindis come in many colours, designs, materials, and sizes.
There are different regional variations of the bindi. In Maharashtra a large crescent moon shaped bindi is worn with a smaller black dot underneath or above, associated with &quot;Chandrabindu&quot; and &quot;Bindu chakra&quot; represented by crescent moon, they are commonly known as &quot;Chandrakor&quot; in this region, outside Maharashtra they are popularly known as &quot;Marathi bindi&quot;. In Bengal region a large round red bindi is worn, brides in this region are often decorated with &quot;Alpana&quot; design on forehead and cheeks, along with bindi. In southern India a smaller red bindi is worn with a white tilak at the bottom, another common type is a red tilak shaped bindi. In Rajasthan the bindi is often worn round. Long tilak shaped bindi are also common, as well as the crescent moon on some occasions. Decorative bindis have become popular among women in South Asia, regardless of religious background. Bindis are a staple and symbolic for women in the Indian subcontinent.

In addition to the bindi, in India, a vermilion mark in the parting of the hair just above the forehead is worn by married women as a symbol of life-long commitment to their husbands. During all Hindu marriage ceremonies, the groom applies sindoor in the part in the bride&#x27;s hair.

Apart from their cosmetic use, bindis have found a modern medical application in India. Iodine patch bindis have often been used among women in north-west Maharashtra to battle iodine deficiency.

===Related customs in other Asian regions===
In Southeast Asia, bindis are worn by the Balinese, Javanese, and Sundanese people of Indonesia. For example, bindis are often worn by brides and grooms in Java and other parts of Indonesia, regardless of their religious beliefs.

The Indonesian practice of wearing a bindi originated from the cultural influence brought about by the Indianized Hindu kingdoms that once ruled Indonesia. Historically, other Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia also took part in this practice.

== Teep ==

Teep or tip, similar to bindis, are part of Bengali culture and women in West Bengal, India and Bangladesh, irrespective of their religion, adorn themselves with teeps as an ethnic practice. By the 18th century the use of teeps had become very common. It&#x27;s popular in celebrations like Durga Puja, Pohela Boishakh, Pohela Falgun, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and other occasions.

Bengali Muslims approve wearing the teep as a cultural representation as long as there is no intention of imitating the bindi culture of other religions. Depending on the occasion the colours of teep change, such as red and white for Pohela Boishakh, green, orange and yellow for Pohela Falgun, blue and white for Barsha Mangal, brown and mustard colour for Nabanna, purple and pink for Eid Al Fitr and black for International mother Language Day, Eid Al Adha, red and green for Independence Day and Victory Day. Bengali Muslim brides wearing &quot;kalka tip&quot; on their forehead is an old tradition of Bangladesh.

== Bindis in Pakistan ==
In Sindh, some Muslim Sindhi women apply a black dot or line by &quot;Kajjal or Surmo (kohl)&quot; on the forehead and chin, and sometimes three dots or lines around eyes as part of historic Indian traditions that have continued post-Partition. As an amulet believed to protect against evil-eye, these dots are called Tikro or Tilk (singular), or Tikra (plural). 

Like in India, in Sindh, when a child is born, black dots/marks and lines are drawn on their faces. In modern times, stick-on bindiyas of different shapes and designs have become very common in rural Sindh, and are applied by both Muslims and Hindus. However, this is in decline as it is considered to be appropriately used by Sindhi Hindus only. 

Back in time in Sindh the brides were applied many dots of &quot;Tira&quot; (moles) drawn upon their face and lips with needles dipped in antimony and other colouring matters.

The type of forehead tattoo called Khaal or Sheen Khal was also common among Afghan and Pashtun women, although it is no longer done for religious reasons. As in Sindh, dots are made using kohl or other material. Bindis are also used by Saraiki and some Baloch tribal women of Pakistan. However, many Muhajir and Punjabi consider the use of bindis to be un-Islamic. Due to this, the use of bindis has declined in many urban areas of Pakistan.

==Modern use==

Bindis are sometimes worn purely for decorative purpose or style statement without any religious or cultural affiliation. Decorative and ornamental bindis were introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. International celebrities such as Gwen Stefani, Julia Roberts, Madonna, Selena Gomez and many others have been seen wearing bindis. The appropriateness of such uses has been disputed. Reacting to Gomez wearing a bindi while singing her song &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, Hindu leader Rajan Zed said that the bindi has religious significance and should not be used as a fashion accessory, but Indian actress Priyanka Chopra praised Gomez&#x27;s choice as &quot;an embrace of Indian culture&quot;. Additionally, several rappers have adopted jewelled bindis, most notably Lil Uzi Vert, who debuted a $24 million pink diamond bindi in February 2021. They were inspired by Lil B who wore a diamond bindi in 2012.

<text>Antonio de Erauso, born as Catalina de Erauso (in Spanish) (San Sebastián, Spain, 1585 or 1592 — Cuetlaxtla near Orizaba, New Spain, 1650), also went by Alonso Díaz and some other masculine names, later taking on the name Antonio de Erauso which he went by for the remainder of his life. He is also known in Spanish as La Monja Alférez (&quot;The Ensign Nun&quot; or &quot;The Nun Lieutenant&quot;). de Erauso was originally an unwilling nun, but escaped the convent and travelled around Spain and Spanish America, mostly under male identities, in the first half of the 17th century. Erauso&#x27;s story has remained alive through historical studies, biographical stories, novels, movies and comics.

== Early years ==

Erauso was born in the Basque town of San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Spain, in either 1585 (according to some sources including a supposed autobiography of 1626) or February 10, 1592 (according to a baptismal certificate). Erauso&#x27;s parents were Miguel de Erauso and Maria Pérez de Arce Galarraga, both of whom had been born and lived in San Sebastián. Miguel was a captain and military commander of the Basque province under the orders of King Philip III of Spain. From an early age, Antonio trained with his father and brothers in the arts of warfare.

== Life at the convent ==

Around the year 1589, at age 4, Erauso (together with sisters Isabel and Maria) was taken to the Dominican convent of San Sebastian el Antiguo, where Erauso&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cousin, Ursula de Uriza e Sarasti, held the position of prioress. Erauso grew into a strong, stocky, and quick-tempered individual. Lacking religious vocation and as a result feeling imprisoned and refusing to take vows, Erauso was detained in a cell and constantly fought with a widowed novice named Catalina de Aliri. At 15, after being beaten by one of the older nuns, Erauso decided to escape. On March 18, 1600, the eve of San Jose, Erauso found the keys of the convent hanging in a corner, waited for the other nuns to be at morning prayer, and escaped. Erauso spent a week fashioning boy&#x27;s clothes, and headed for Vitoria, staying off the main roads. With short hair, Erauso easily passed as a boy there.

== Travels around Spain ==

From this moment on, Erauso began the life of a fugitive, later narrated in the autobiography that gave him great fame. In Vitoria, Erauso met a doctor and professor, Francisco de Cerralta, who was married to Erauso&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cousin but took Erauso in without recognizing him. Erauso stayed with him for three months, learning some Latin, but when Cerralta became abusive, Erauso left. Erauso took money from the doctor, met a mule driver and went to Valladolid with him. The court of King Philip III of Spain resided in Valladolid, under the influence of the Duke of Lerma. Disguised as a man by the name of Francisco de Loyola, Erauso served in the court for seven months as a page of the king&#x27;s secretary, Juan de Idiáquez, until one day Erauso&#x27;s father came looking for Idiáquez. His father conversed with Idiáquez, , all without recognizing that he had just spoken to that child. Afterwards, Erauso decided to head to Bilbao.

Upon arriving, Erauso was unable to find a place to sleep nor a patron. In addition, a group of boys made fun of and attacked him, and when he got into a rock fight and injured one, he was arrested and spent a month in jail. Upon release from prison, Erauso went to Estella, and found work as a page there too, under an important lord of the town called Alonso de Arellano. Erauso was his servant for two years, always well treated and well dressed. Between 1602 and 1603, after years of service to Arellano, Erauso returned to San Sebastián, his hometown, and lived as a man there, taking care of relatives, whom he saw frequently. He also attended mass in his old convent with former colleagues. It is said that he also served his aunt without ever being recognized. After some time, he came to Pasaia, where he met Captain Miguel de Berróiz, who took him to Seville. They were there for only two days. He later returned to Sanlucar de Barrameda, where he found a job as a cabin boy on a ship. Captain Esteban Eguiño, who was a cousin of Erauso&#x27;s mother, owned the galleon. According to memoirs, he embarked on Holy Monday, 1603 to America. Erauso felt, like many Basques of his time, inclined to venture to the Indies.

He spent this time as a man, in masculine dress with short hair, using different names such as Pedro de Orive, Francisco de Loyola, Alonso Díaz [Ramirez] de Guzmán, and Antonio de Erauso. Apparently, his physique was not feminine, which helped him pass as a man. Erauso once said he &quot;dried her breasts&quot; with a secret ointment.

== Travels to the New World ==

The first place in the Americas where Erauso landed was Punta de Araya, now part of Venezuela, where he had a confrontation with a Dutch pirate fleet which he defeated. From there they left for Cartagena and Nombre de Dios, where they stayed for nine days. Several sailors died there because of the weather. They boarded the silver and once ready to return to Spain, Erauso shot and killed his uncle and stole 500 pesos. He told the sailors that his uncle had sent him on an errand. An hour later, the ship returned to Spain without him. From there he went with an usher to Panama, where he spent three months. In Panama he started working with Juan de Urquiza, merchant of Trujillo with whom he went to the port of Paita (now Peru), where the trader had a large shipment. In the port of Manta (now Ecuador), a strong wind destroyed the ship and Erauso had to swim to save himself and his master. The rest of the crew perished.

After a brief time in Paita, he went to Zana, a place full of cattle, grains, fruits and tobacco from Peru. There, his master happily accommodated here gave Erauso a home, clothing and a large amount of money, as well as three black slaves. In Saña he had a fight with a young man who threatened him in a comedy theater. He ended up cutting off the face of the boy who challenged him. He was taken to jail again and through efforts of his master, Juan de Urquiza, and the bishop of that place, he was released on the condition that he married Doña Beatriz de Cárdenas, lady of his master and aunt of the man who had his face cut. He refused to marry. Then he went to the city of Trujillo, where his master opened a store.

However, the man who was wounded in the face came to challenge him again accompanied by two friends. Erauso went to the fight with another person, and in the fight the man&#x27;s friend was killed. He was again imprisoned, and after his master saved him again, he gave Erauso money and a letter of recommendation and sent him to Lima, which was the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. He gave the letter of recommendation to Diego de Solarte, a very rich merchant and greater consul of Lima, and after a few days Erauso was given his shop. He was responsible for the business for nine months, but was fired when discovered fondling a woman, the sister of his master&#x27;s wife. After being dismissed, he found a company recruiting, whose aim was the conquest of Chile and, beset by the need to find a new occupation, he enlisted under the command of Captain Gonzalo Rodriguez. Erauso was accompanied by 1600 men from Lima to the city of Concepción. From 1617-19 he worked as a llama-driver from Chuquisaca to the great mining center of Potosí, and was then recruited as a soldier.

== Military exploits ==

After marching with his company to Chile in 1619, his army swept through the lands and property of the Mapuches; he showed his aggressive side as conqueror, massacring many Indians. In Chile the secretary of the governor was his brother Don Miguel de Erauso; the secretary welcomed him without recognizing him. He remained there for three years and because of a dispute with his brother, possibly because of a woman, was banished to Paicabí, the land of Indians. There, Erauso fought in the service of the crown in the Arauco War against the Mapuches in today&#x27;s Chile, earning a reputation for being brave and skillful with weapons and without revealing that he was biologically a woman.

In the battle of Valdivia he was promoted to second lieutenant. In the following battle of Puren his captain was killed and he took command, winning the battle. However, due to the many complaints against him for his cruelty to the Indians, Erauso was not further promoted; frustrated, he entered a period devoted to vandalizing, killing people as he met on the road, causing extensive damage and burning crops. In Concepción he assassinated the chief auditor of the city, for which he was locked in a church for six months. After being released, Antonio killed his brother Miguel in a duel, and was again imprisoned for eight months. He later fled to the Governorate of the Río de la Plata (now Argentina) across the Andes, taking a difficult path. At the brink of death he was saved by a villager and taken to Tucumán, where he promised marriage to two young women, the daughter of an Indian widow (who had hosted Erauso on her farm during his convalescence) and the niece of a canon.

He ended up fleeing from there without marrying either of them, but kept the money and fine clothing given by the canon&#x27;s niece as a sign of love. Then he went to Potosí, where he became the assistant to a sergeant, and returned again to fight against the Indians, participating in mass killings in Chuncos. In La Plata (formerly Chuquisaca, later Sucre) he was accused of a crime he did not commit; he was tortured and finally freed again without his sex being discovered. Once out of prison, he devoted himself to smuggling wheat and cattle on the orders of Juan Lopez de Arquijo. A new lawsuit forced him to take refuge in a church. In Piscobamba he killed a person in a quarrel. This time he was sentenced to death, but was saved at the last minute by the deposition of another prisoner sentenced to death. Then he remained in sanctuary for five months in a church due to a duel with a jealous husband. When he moved to La Paz, he was sentenced again to death for another offense. To escape, he pretended to confess and, after seizing a consecrated host, fled to Cuzco and returned to Peru.

== Return to Spain and audience with Pope Urban VIII ==

In 1623 Erauso was arrested in Huamanga, Peru, because of a dispute. To avoid execution, he begged Bishop Agustín de Carvajal for mercy, and confessed that he was a woman who had been in a convent. Following a review in which a group of matrons determined that Erauso was a woman and a virgin, the bishop protected him and he was sent to Spain.

In 1625–1626, Erauso petitioned the Spanish Crown for financial reward for services as a soldier in the New World, presenting a &quot;relación de méritos y servicios&quot; (account of merits and services). In addition to seeking reward for time at war, Erauso also sought compensation for money lost while traveling to Rome. This document includes accounts from &quot;witnesses&quot; or others who knew Erauso. However, many of the accounts contradict each other, and some witnesses do not know what to make of Erauso&#x27;s predicament, for several reasons, most prominently that the witnesses all knew Erauso by different names and for different accomplishments. They may have known &quot;Alonso Díaz de Guzmán&quot;, one of the names Erauso used as a man, but they did not know Catalina de Erauso.

Scholars disagree on whether or not Erauso met Pope Urban VIII, but his Account of Merits and Services was filed in 1625 or 1626 in the Archivo General de Indias and the Real Academia de la Historia of Madrid, which would match up with accounts of him being in Rome at that time. Erauso was famous enough in Spain at this time that Juan Pérez de Montalbán published a play about his life in 1625, the &quot;Comedia famosa de la Monja Alferez&quot;.

== Return to New Spain and death ==
In 1630 Erauso settled in the New Spain, probably in the city of Orizaba, now in the state of Veracruz, and established a business as a muleteer between Mexico City and Veracruz. Locals state that Erauso died carrying a load on a boat, though some argue his death occurred at the heights of Orizaba, alone; most plausible is that he died in the village of Cotaxtla. According to the historian Joaquín Arróniz, his remains rest in the Church of the Royal Hospital of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of the Juaninos Brothers, which today is popularly known as the Church of San Juan de Dios, in the city of Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico. Although there is no solid evidence to support it, some postulate that Bishop Juan de Palafox tried to move the remains to the city of Puebla, home of the bishopric, but failed. Instead, according to other historians, the remains of Erauso rest in the same place where it is believed he died, in the village of Cotaxtla. However, there is no documentation that can demonstrate the exact date and place of death.

== Autobiography and controversy over its authorship ==
Antonio de Erauso (under the name Catalina de Erauso) wrote or dictated an autobiography around the time of his visit to Spain in 1626. The autobiography remained in manuscript form until it was first published in Paris in 1829 at the request of Joaquín María Ferrer, a second time in Barcelona in 1838, and for the third time in 1894 in Paris, with illustrations by Spanish artist Daniel Vierge. The account was subsequently translated into other languages.

Currently, there is debate among researchers about the authorship of this autobiography, which some researchers have branded as apocryphal and without any basis for engaging in some chronological inaccuracies and contradictions. However, given the existence of baptism certificates and testimonies from others about Erauso&#x27;s life and works, there is strong evidence for the historical existence of this person.

Some have wanted to see a relationship between Erauso&#x27;s extraordinary life, and the Baroque taste for portraying marginal and / or deformed or abnormal characters, as the main reason for the fame he gained throughout the Hispanic world on his return from America.

== Questions of gender and sexual identity ==
Modern scholars have debated Erauso&#x27;s sexual orientation and gender identity. In a memoir, Erauso never mentions being attracted to a man, but details numerous relationships with women. There was an encounter with the sister-in-law of a Lima merchant, a quarrel with Erauso&#x27;s brother over his mistress and other occasions of Erauso being betrothed to women in the New World. Those betrothals, however, usually ended after Erauso exploited the situation and rode off with gifts and dowry money. Erauso also mentions once being surprised by a hostess &quot;touching between her legs,&quot; and also acknowledges having taken advantage twice of being &#x27;disguised&#x27; as a man to get gifts from a future fiancée who did not know Erauso&#x27;s sex.

Other scholars, such as Sherry Velasco, have also written on the subject of gender and sexual identity. Velasco and others argue for viewing Erauso as transgender, and Velasco also argues for viewing Erauso as lesbian, saying that, over the years since the first printings of Erauso&#x27;s memoirs, there have been many different retellings and exaggerations in an effort to &quot;de-lesbianize&quot; Erauso through the invention of different heterosexual relationships as well as downplaying Erauso&#x27;s relationships and behavior with other women. This happened mostly in versions of the story told and published in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, Velasco argues there was a &quot;re-lesbianization&quot; of Erauso, . Then, in the 1980s, Erauso appeared as a &quot;melancholy lesbian whose lover dies and a voyeuristic lesbian whose narrative ends with the optimistic image of the protagonist accompanied by the object of her sexual desire.&quot;

Matthew Goldmark, in turn, takes the approach of examining Erauso&#x27;s Accounts of Merits and Services document, and in particular the &quot;hábitos&quot; or &quot;habits&quot; section of the document, with an eye to Erauso&#x27;s sexual orientation and identity. This section gives accounts from witnesses or other people who knew Erauso and could speak to his demeanor in petitioning the King and the Pope. This section also was an intersection of not only gender, but also class and profession.

Regardless of how Erauso identified, researchers are still divided as to the reason for Erauso&#x27;s grand story of adventures. Some argue that Erauso had to pretend to be attracted to women in order to stay disguised and to blend in with fellow Spanish soldiers. Others argue that Erauso was actually a lesbian who used dress as a way to not attract attention from church authorities and to continue to be attracted to women. Still others fall into the third camp that Erauso actually did identify as a man. Those in this school of thought conclude from the evidence given by Erauso that Erauso was merely expressing a gender identity and was transgender.

== Legacy ==
Despite the existence of autobiographical memoirs probably written around 1626, Erauso ended up disappearing from most known historical records, specifically in the period running between returning to Spain in 1624 and returning to the Indies, until the eighteenth century. At the end of the century, states Sonia Pérez-Villanueva, one Domingo de Urbirú had in his possession a manuscript copy of Erauso&#x27;s memoirs, which was duplicated by a friend, the poet and playwright Cándido Maria Trigueros.

One of the copies made by Trigueros ended up in the hands of the academic Juan Bautista Muñoz, who was writing the &quot;History of the New World&quot; and included a mention of Erauso in his work. Eventually, the copy was used as a reference by Muñoz finished in the hands of the Royal Academy of History in 1784, and later was rediscovered in the early nineteenth century by the politician Felipe Bauzá, who persuaded his friend, the astronomer and merchant Joaquín María Ferrer for publishing. Finally, the manuscript was published in 1829 in Paris by Jules Didot with the title &quot;La historia de la Monja Alférez, escrita por ella misma&quot; (&quot;story of The Nun Lieutenant, written by herself&quot;), and a few decades later was republished by Heredia in 1894, making this version of the autobiography the revival of interest and research into Erauso&#x27;s life.

The character of The Nun Lieutenant was, and remains today, a source of inspiration for writers, playwrights, filmmakers and artists (most notably a 1630 portrait, attributed to Juan van der Hamen). In the nineteenth century, the work of Thomas De Quincey stands out, who turns Erauso into a typically romantic character, victim of fate and immersed in a series of adventures. Also in the nineteenth century is the novel by Eduardo Blasco &quot;Del claustro al campamento o la Monja Alférez.&quot; And similarly it has been a source of inspiration for many analyses and academic papers trying to explain Erauso&#x27;s complex personality. In the twentieth century the Monja Alférez hit the screens and became more popular through several film versions, as in &quot;La Monja Alférez&quot;, directed by Mexican Emilio Gómez Muriel (1947). At present, this character is attractive to the poststructuralist critique, as a clear example of instability and relativity of the notion of gender in the construction of the identity of an individual.

In 2019 textual analysis concluded that a 17th-century play called &quot;La Monja Alférez&quot; whose authorship had not been known had in fact been written by Juan Ruiz de Alarcón.

<doc id="1138419" wikidata="Q5339013" url="?curid=1138419" title="Edmonton Aviators">
<text>The Edmonton Aviators were a soccer club based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The club was founded in 2003 as a member of the United Soccer League&#x27;s A-League and folded after playing only one season in 2004. Midway through the season, with the club in financial trouble, the league took it over to save it from folding. The renamed Edmonton F.C. only lasted until the end of the year.

==History==

Expectations that Edmonton could support an A-League team were high, as the city had recently hosted the inaugural FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Championship at Commonwealth Stadium to tremendous success and similarly had success in hosting a number of the Canadian men&#x27;s international games.

The group that brought the Aviators to Edmonton claimed that they were in it for the long haul, believing that they could keep the team in Edmonton for three years at a minimum, offering both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer to the city of Edmonton. However, the owners were planning for average crowds of 11,000 at Commonwealth Stadium, which some members of the local press held as unrealistic. This would have placed the Aviators, a mere expansion team, near the top of the A-League in attendance. On April 29, 2004, they announced their men&#x27;s roster, including former Drillers Kurt Bosch, Rick Titus, Nikola Vignjevic, Eric Munoz, and Sipho Sibiya, as well as a number of highly regarded local players such as U-20 National Team player Chris Lemire. To round out the roster, internationals Claudio Salinas, Jaime Lopresti, and Jose Luis Campi were added. There was great hope and optimism for the local team&#x27;s success.

===Franchise failure===

The team was dogged by a number of problems:

According to the local press, one of the main problems was the venue. Commonwealth Stadium was the home of the Canadian national soccer teams, but with a seating capacity over 60,000 people, the smaller crowds were utterly dwarfed by the large stadium. Rent was extremely high, and the Edmonton Eskimos had priority with Commonwealth&#x27;s facilities. As a result, the Aviators were constantly restricted in what they could do at Commonwealth. Smaller Clarke Stadium was just across the street, but the Aviators did not move there until late in the season. Also, as a result of the venue choice, the Aviators were unsuccessful at getting weekend dates for their games. Only 3 out of 11 matches were scheduled for the weekend, owing to previous bookings for the Edmonton Eskimos, the local CFL football team, and the international rugby tournament, the Churchill Cup.

Moreover, the men&#x27;s team had the worst performance in the league, as might be expected for a new team, but still to the displeasure of Edmonton sports fans. The team&#x27;s performance was not helped by difficulties between the players and the team&#x27;s administration. Rick Titus, one of the veteran players, encountered some friction between him and the former president Wylie Stafford, through to head coach Ross Ongaro, and on down to several teammates. According to the Edmonton Sun (July 4, 2004), the centre of this dispute was the requirement that approximately half of the team had to consist of local players. As a consequence, Titus was released by the Aviators in mid-season, eventually joining the Toronto Lynx. Shortly thereafter, Titus attempted to amend this area of difficulty but as was reported, Joe Petrone, then heading the club, maintained that the damage was done and that the player was not going to be accepted back. In the same atmosphere, as noted in the Edmonton Sun (July 6, 2004), Waldemar Dutra, a promising local goal-scorer who trained with the Aviators, left for Schweinfurt, a Third Division team in Germany.

Further, as cited in the Edmonton Journal (July 20, 2004, p. A4), the business plan of the team&#x27;s owners was a source of some concern for local soccer officials. As noted in the press, with lower attendance than expected and higher costs than anticipated, the owners returned their franchise on August 15, after it failed to meet its revenue expectations for the three months it existed. The club&#x27;s ownership group, Edmonton Professional Soccer (EPSL) Ltd admitted to the league that the business plan, put in place at the start of the franchise, was flawed. With ticket sales much closer to the league average of 3000 people, the EPSL was suffering large operating losses. The club&#x27;s 19-person ownership refused to provide immediate cash injection to keep both the men and women&#x27;s teams afloat, and chose to see the franchise fold. As a consequence, the league took over operation of the Aviators, renaming the team Edmonton F.C. as the old owners took the rights to the Aviators name with them. The team was run on a shoestring budget, transferring away what few skilled players the Aviators had acquired and moving to the much smaller Foote Field where, incidentally, attendance was noticeably better.

The team was folded by the league after the 2004 season. After the club&#x27;s folding was announced, it was speculated by some in the local press that the team could have worked if a better business model was arranged from the outset.

The team&#x27;s only coach was Ross Ongaro.
Steve O&#x27;Boyle The Team 1260 now TSN 1260 would announce games before the franchise&#x27;s demise. copyrighted

<doc id="1138424" wikidata="Q1674962" url="?curid=1138424" title="Isuzu Gemini">
<text>The Isuzu Gemini is a subcompact car produced by the Japanese automaker Isuzu from 1974 until 2000. The same basic product was built and/or sold under several other names, sometimes by other General Motors brands, in various markets around the world. While the first generation was of a rear-wheel drive design, later versions were all front-wheel-drive, and the last two generations were no more than badge-engineered Honda Domani until the name was retired in 2000.


==First generation (1974) ==
The first Gemini was the Bellett Gemini, first seen in November 1974. It was based on the third-generation Opel Kadett C on the General Motors T-car platform and came in four-door sedan and two-door coupe body styles. The chassis code was PF50, although the later 1.8-liter versions were called PF60 and the diesels PFD60.

In June 1977 the Gemini received its first, light, facelift. The bigger 1817 cc G180 series engine became available, fitted with rectangular headlights rather than the round units used on the 1600. This model offered , although this output dropped to if an automatic transmission was fitted. In November of the same year the 1600 was updated, now with square headlights and an engine with the I·CAS oxidation catalyst (&quot;Isuzu Clean Air System&quot;) which could manage the 1978 emissions standards. One year later the Gemini 1800&#x27;s engine was also upgraded to meet the 1978 emissions standards. Power remained unchanged, and the automatic now offered the same power as cars with manual transmission. The ignition system was now of a transistor less type, and the trunk lid was now opened remotely (not added to the Gemini 1600 until the end of December). The Gemini Black and 1800 Minx were also added, the Minx with a two-tone paintjob and the Black with black paintwork and more sporty yet comfortable equipment including alloy wheels.
In June 1979, the Gemini received a new slant nose with rectangular headlights and a redesigned rear end. The changes were actually more comprehensive than that, also including a redesigned (longer) engine bay and a wider radiator opening for two new engines added in November (the twin cam G180W and the new 4FB1 diesel) which both required wider radiators for more air for cooling.

In Japan, sports models were available originally with the &quot;ZZ&quot; name. Later, ZZ/L (1980), ZZ/R (1981), ZZ/T, and ZZ/E models were added. These were equipped with an Isuzu G180W 8-valve DOHC 1.8-liter engine, most commonly fuel-injected, producing at 6400 rpm. These models also came with a shortened remote throw manual shift lever and optional factory LSD differential. There was also a mildly sporting model of the OHC 1800, called the LS/G.

In October 1982 a version of the diesel with Bosch VE electronic fuel injection was also added; this provided 8% more power than the regular version (66 versus 61 PS) and was fitted to the LT-E and LJ-E models. For those who wanted more, a turbo diesel appeared a month later. Also featuring electronic fuel injection, this model also received a standard rear anti-roll bar. Counterintuitively, the two more powerful diesels were never available with the coupé bodywork.

The Gemini was complemented in 1981 by the Giugiaro-designed coupé Isuzu Piazza, based on the Gemini&#x27;s platform, which was introduced in the United States in 1983 as the Isuzu Impulse and in Australia in 1986 as the Holden Piazza. After the front-wheel-drive second generation Gemini appeared in early 1985, the old rear-wheel drive version nonetheless continued to be built. The coupé model was discontinued, and a slimmed down sedan range (including the ZZ and diesel models) continued to be available. This diminished range was produced until February 1987, when the rear-wheel drive Gemini was laid to rest after 768,537 had been built.

===In other markets===

;North America
The North American market version was originally sold as the &quot;Opel by Isuzu&quot; and then the Buick Opel (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Buick Isuzu Opel&quot;). It first appeared in late 1975, for the 1976 model year, and replaced the German-built Kadett which had become too expensive as a result of the weakening dollar and rising costs in Germany. Road &amp; Track decried the switch, stating that the Isuzu felt &quot;built to a price&quot; and that unlike the real Opel, it was &quot;one of our least favorite cars.&quot; In 1978 a &quot;Sports Coupé&quot; was added to the lineup, its changes being limited to the paint, different steel wheels, sporty mirrors, and a spoiler. For 1979 the car received a light cosmetic update with ribbed velour trim, a few new paint options, and rectangular headlights.

18,801 model year 1978 Buick Opels were sold, followed by 17,564 in 1979. In the middle of the calendar year the model was dropped, but supplies lasted long enough for another 950 cars to be sold during 1980.

For the 1981 model year, the &quot;Buick Opel&quot; metamorphosed into the &quot;Isuzu I-Mark&quot;. Unlike the Buick-badged versions the I-Mark was also available with a diesel engine, but the standard engine was a (SAE net) version of the 1.8 litre G180Z engine. The diesel had a claimed (SAE net) at an unusually high 5,000 rpm. The I-Mark was offered with four-door sedan or two-door coupé bodywork with either engine, in Deluxe or fully equipped LS (added for the 1982 model year) trim. A 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic were on offer. There was also a base diesel-engined coupé on offer, with a 4-speed manual transmission only. The diesel gradually lost sales after USA&#x27;s brief love affair with the diesel car came to an end in the early eighties, and eventually it was only available in a single coupé version. For 1985, the rear-wheel-drive I-Mark&#x27;s last year, only the Deluxe sedan version with the gasoline engine remained available. Power remained at at 4,800 rpm.

;Australasia
Early Australian cars, from the 1975 launch, were badged Holden-Isuzu. In addition to sedan and coupé models, Holden in Australia produced the Gemini as a three-door station wagon and three-door panel van, which were derived from the Opel Kadett C Caravan and Vauxhall Chevette wagon, with Isuzu Gemini front panels. The panel van&#x27;s side panels came from the Bedford Chevanne. The Australian Holden Gemini was fitted with an Isuzu G161Z petrol engine, although 1979 and later models were available with a 1.8-litre 8-valve SOHC diesel engine (4FB1). The more common G161Z was a 1.6-liter 8-valve SOHC fed by a Nikki carburettor. The Holden Gemini was &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year for 1975.

It was also assembled and sold in New Zealand from 1977 to 1984. The car received Isuzu badging for the first few years in this market, as the brand had already been established by the earlier Bellett, which had also been assembled locally.

;Other markets
In Europe, the Gemini was equipped with the 1.6-liter engine which produced DIN there; the discrepancy in stated power (down 32 percent) may have been entirely due to the differences to the SAE (gross) measuring system used on Japanese market cars.

Isuzu Gemini was also sold in South Korea as the Saehan Gemini, whose manufacturer became Daewoo Motors in 1982. It then became Daewoo Maepsy after 1982 and remained on sale (later as the Maepsy-Na after a facelift) until it was replaced by the Daewoo LeMans in 1986. It continued to be assembled as a taxi model called Maepsy Sigma until 1989.

== Second generation (1985)==


General Motors sought a replacement for their world car T-body Kadett / Gemini, and this time, instead of building one design on several continents, they decided to build a world car in one location and export it to several continents. As a considerable portion of the T-body manufacturing had been turned over to Isuzu in Japan for economic reasons, so would the manufacturing of the replacement. In 1984, Isuzu again commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro who was responsible for the 117 Coupé and the Piazza. This time, he was to design an economy car on the new front-wheel drive R-body platform. The R-body featured a MacPherson strut front suspension and beam axle rear suspension, which foreshadowed most of GM&#x27;s offerings through their current model lineup. Giugiaro&#x27;s design followed the Piazza design very closely in shape and detail, though the proportions made the Gemini appear shorter and taller in its three-door version, and a four-door sedan (notch back) was also designed.

Unfortunately for everyone involved, Isuzu presented the designs to GM prior to freezing them, and GM ordered a number of detail changes to them without ever consulting the designer, Giugiaro, which was taken as an insult, and ended the long relationship between the noted Italian designer and Japan&#x27;s second oldest car builder. The insult was serious enough to Giugiaro that he denied the design was his until a decade after the vehicle went out of production.

The R-body Gemini was introduced in May 1985 as the &quot;Gemini FF&quot; (after it had already gone on sale as a Chevrolet in the United States), with an all-new line of engines. In Japan, originally with chassis code JT150, it was available with a carburetted 1.5-liter SOHC engine. An also newly developed 1.5-liter inline four diesel engine (JT600) was added to the lineup in November. At the other end of the lineup, a fuel-injected and turbocharged version of the 1.5-liter 4XC1 engine (&quot;Irmscher&quot;) was added in May 1986. Originally, the transmission started out with a choice of a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic, but NAVi5, an automated manual transmission, was added in 1986.

The FF Gemini underwent a facelift in February 1987, receiving a more aggressive front styling with wraparound headlight as well as other minor changes. At the same time, the &quot;FF&quot; moniker was dropped, as parallel production of the preceding RWD Gemini came to an end. In March 1987 the Gemini saw its European premiere, at the Geneva Motor Show. European sales of the already somewhat dated Gemini were disappointing, and Isuzu soon withdrew from the European passenger car market entirely.

A 1.6-liter DOHC engine with was introduced in February 1988. Export versions were also available with a smaller 1.3-liter four to suit taxation systems based on displacement. This offered , while export specification 1.5s had on tap and the naturally aspirated diesel offered outside Japan. Trim levels were widely varied, from basic models (&quot;C/C&quot; in Japan, &quot;LT&quot; in general export markets, and &quot;S&quot; in the US) to Irmscher, ZZ, and Lotus Tuned versions, and plenty of optional equipment and dealer options were available.

A second minor change was released in February 1989 for Japan only. The position of the rear license plate garnish for the sedan model has been moved from the trunk lid to the center part of the bumper. Other differences include the amber turn indicators lens now having been dropped, and an addition of side marker lights. In total, 748,216 second generation Geminis (under all nameplates) were built. 150,873 of these were sold as Isuzu I-Marks in the United States, while 363,171 were sold under the Chevrolet and Geo badges.

===North America===
In the US, the vehicle was available from Chevrolet (and as a Geo beginning in mid-1988) as the Spectrum, or from Isuzu themselves, as the I-Mark. GM&#x27;s Pontiac division sold the I-Mark as the Pontiac Sunburst in Canada from 1985 to 1988. Sales were limited to coastal markets initially, as import quotas restricted the number of cars General Motors could sell in the United States. The Spectrum was presented at the end of November 1984, with cars initially going on sale in 16 eastern states. Isuzu&#x27;s own I-Mark went on sale during the 1985 model year. Due to the quotas, only 29,500 cars were available the first model year, about a quarter of what GM had hoped to be able to sell.

The introductory model years featured a unique eggcrate grille flanked by single square sealed-beam headlights, but for 1987 the Spectrum (and I-Mark) received the restyled front end with &quot;cat&#x27;s eyes&quot; headlights and 5-mph bumpers. The interior was also revamped, and the Spectrum Turbo was added to the lineup. Isuzu&#x27;s turbocharged version, dubbed RS, was a later introduction, arriving early in calendar year 1987. The Spectrum Turbo was only available as a four-door sedan, while the I-Mark RS was only available as a hatchback.

US sales of the Isuzu I-Mark were down by half for the latter half of 1989, as a lengthy changeover to the new models slowed down production in Japan. Isuzu was contractually obliged to supply a certain number of Geo Spectrums, meaning that there were very few I-Marks available for Isuzu&#x27;s own dealers. With a delayed introduction of the upcoming Stylus (third generation Gemini), Isuzu largely abandoned the passenger car segment for nearly a year, selling mostly leftover stock of the old Impulse.

GM Canada replaced the Sunburst with the Passport Optima for 1988. For GM, this was an entry-level vehicle to attract young buyers and to compete with Japanese midsize cars in the US market. Chevrolet&#x27;s Spectrum lacked many of the options and equipment of the I-Mark, although with the exception of a brief run of decontented hatchbacks in 1988 dubbed &quot;Spectrum Express&quot; they were not as austere as the base trim levels of contemporary Dodge Colt, Toyota Tercel and Honda Civics. Both the Chevrolet and the Isuzu were available with the 1.5-liter SOHC non-turbo and turbo engines, but neither diesel engines nor NAVi5 were offered in the US. The turbocharged I-Mark was called the RS model in 1988 and then changed to the LS model in 1989. The I-Mark was available with the 1.6-liter DOHC engine in 1989 only, as the RS model. In 1988 and 1989, the LS and RS models were offered with Lotus Tuned Suspension, the sportier suspension featuring more rigid dampers, alternate spring rates, and bigger sway bars.

For 1988, the Chevrolet Spectrum was available as the base model, with a better equipped LS package, or as the Turbo Sedan. There was also a Spectrum Sport Coupe package (hatchback only) on offer, using the standard engine combined with some of the Turbo&#x27;s equipment, such as a sporty steering wheel, different rear view mirrors, a rear spoiler, fully body colored exterior (grille, bumpers, door handles, etcetera), and the uprated F41 suspension. The 1989 Geo Spectrum (introduced in June 1988 as an early 1989 model year) was only available with the naturally aspirated 1.5-liter engine in a single equipment level, with either the three-door hatchback or four-door sedan bodywork.

==Third generation (1990)==


The Gemini was redesigned for 1990, and the coupé version was now renamed the Gemini Coupé. The last models were produced in June 1993. The third generation sedan appeared in March 1990. Body size was wider than the previous generation. A liftback coupé was introduced in September 1990, with the three-door hatchback version added in March 1991. The last of the Isuzu-developed Geminis and its derivatives were sold as the Isuzu Impulse, Isuzu Piazza, Isuzu Gemini, Isuzu Stylus, Geo Storm, and Asüna Sunfire.

The Isuzu Gemini Coupé was the basis for the Isuzu Impulse and Geo Storm in the United States and Canada, and for the Asüna Sunfire which was sold in the Canadian market for the 1993 model year only. The Geo versions lacked some of the more expensive and advanced features of the Isuzu (and Asüna) versions. The 4-door sedan was sold as the Isuzu Stylus in the United States and Canada.

Model codes were JT151F for the front-wheel drive 1.5/1.6-litre gasoline versions, JT191F for the front-wheel drive 1600 DOHC model, and JT191S for the four-wheel drive, turbocharged &quot;Irmscher R&quot; version. Turbodiesels are JT641F/JT641S for front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive models respectively.

In North America, the base Stylus &quot;S&quot; model received a 1.6 L SOHC version of the 4XE1, available in 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmissions. The 1990 and 1991 top-line Stylus &quot;XS&quot; models had a 4XE1-UW 1.6 L naturally aspirated DOHC engine only available with a 5-speed manual transmission when introduced, and received the 4XF1 1.8 L naturally aspirated DOHC engine with the 5-speed manual in its final 1992 model year. The Stylus initially was offered in two trim levels in 1990 and 1991, the base Stylus &quot;S&quot; with a 1.6 L SOHC 12-valve 4XE1 engine, and the top-level &quot;XS&quot; with the DOHC engine and the Lotus-tuned suspension. The XS also offered an optional power equipment package, which included power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, and a sunroof. This XS &quot;Power Package&quot; would evolve into the 1.8 L &quot;RS&quot; trim level for 1992, slotting above the &quot;XS&quot; trim for 1992. The DOHC Stylus (both &quot;XS&quot; and &quot;RS&quot;) would be dropped after 1992, leaving the lone SOHC &quot;S&quot; trim for the final 1993 model year to stand alongside the Geo Storm platform triplet. The third platform triplet, the Impulse, would also be withdrawn after 1992 and was sold in Canada for 1993 only as the Asüna Sunfire, as Isuzu was preparing its passenger car exit from the US market in July 1993.

The higher trim level packages offered &quot;ZZ handling by Lotus&quot; and &quot;specification Irmscher&quot; as the performance models in the lineup, but was carryovered from previous generations. The top model was the &quot;Irmscher-R&quot; JT191S type, equipped with a high-power turbocharged engine and full-time 4WD. The suspension packages that were installed on the second generation Isuzu Piazza were also shared on the Gemini sold in Japan, including the four-wheel steering setup.

North American sales of the sedan started from December 1990 under the name Isuzu Stylus. Initial orders were above target in Japan, but production lagged behind. Strong early sales began to slump within a year, however, and as the post-bubble recession began to take hold in Japan, Isuzu was particularly affected. After a corporate restructuring, Isuzu decided to abandon passenger car production and focus on commercial truck and SUV production, as the Trooper and the Rodeo found many buyers internationally, with badge engineered versions sold under a variety of brands and names across different markets.

The total production volume of vehicles was 406,625 units at the end of the third generation (from HQ Isuzu), with 17,754 units sold in the United States (from Ward&#x27;s Automotive Yearbook).
==Fourth generation (1993)==

In 1993, Isuzu halted production of the Gemini and replaced it with a rebadged version of the Honda Domani. Announced at the end of August it went on sale in early September 1993. Isuzu did not really advertise the new Gemini; it was mainly produced to be sold to existing customers of Isuzu&#x27;s commercial vehicles. It was only available with the four-door sedan bodystyle and a limited number of engines; the Domani also came as a five-door hatchback.

The models at the time of introduction were the 1600 C/C, C/C 4WD, and the slightly more powerful and better equipped G/G model. Maximum power output is at 6,300 rpm for the C/C and at 6,400 rpm for the G/G. In May 1995 the E-VTEC equipped 1500 C/C model was added to the lineup; this fuel efficient, lean-burn model was aimed at capturing some of the old buyers of diesel-engined Geminis. Diesels had accounted for about half of Gemini sales for the previous generations. The 1500 C/C has a maximum power of at 5,500 rpm. In October 1995, the Gemini underwent some very minor changes in equipment and the 1600 C/C engine was lightly modified. Most notably, the &quot;Gemini&quot; sticker on the front doors was changed to a plastic emblem. Production of the fourth-generation Gemini ended in January 1997 and it was replaced the following month.

==Fifth generation (1997)==


The fifth generation Gemini was a rebadged second generation Honda Domani sedan, a car which was also marketed as a Civic in Europe. Production of this model ceased in 2000. As usual, the Gemini was available in a much more limited lineup than that of the related Honda version, with only one bodystyle (four-door sedan) and either a 1.5- or a 1.6-litre engine.
==Safety==
In Australia, the 1982–1984 Holden Gemini was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing &quot;significantly worse than average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of a crash. The second generation Gemini (RB) rated better, at &quot;worse than average&quot;.

==Related information==
The first and second generation Isuzu Geminis, specifically the diesel ones, were the most popular taxicab models in the Philippines in the 1980s and early 1990s. Models were phased out and gradually replaced with newer models from Toyota and Nissan.

The Singapore Police Force used the Isuzu Gemini Fast Response Cars (FRCs) from 1991 until 1995 until they were phased out and replaced by the Subaru Impreza police cars.

The front-wheel drive Geminis (second and third generation) were marketed in Japan with the catch phrase , and television commercials featuring exciting driving stunts throughout the streets of Paris. With French professional stunt driver Rèmy Julienne mostly coordinating with all of the stunts, the Geminis enjoyed wide popularity.

<text>The Holden Gemini is a compact car that was produced by Holden and sold in Australasia from 1975 to 1987. It was based on the Japanese Isuzu Gemini, one of the many models based on the GM T-car platform.

== First generation ==
=== TX (1975–1977) ===
The original Holden Gemini model, the TX series, was introduced in February 1975. It was available as a four-door sedan in S and SL specification levels, and as a two-door SL coupe. The TX Gemini was built at Holden&#x27;s factory at Acacia Ridge, Queensland, and contained a high percentage of Australian content.

All TX models share the same 1.6-litre SOHC Isuzu engine (coded the G161Z). The engine is chain-driven and incorporates a cross-flow design, alloy head. A two-barrel &quot;Nikki&quot; Stromberg carburettor was used on Australian models. Early TX models use a cast-iron, free-flow exhaust manifold, with two outlets into a &quot;Y&quot; pipe (this item is commonly used by modifiers for later models). From November 1976, this was changed to a single-outlet exhaust header.

Wheel size is 13 in x 4.5 in; rear brakes are duo-servo units, similar in design to those used in the six-cylinder Torana. Early models use the MSE-type four-speed manual transmissions; reverse is positioned to the left and back. November 1975 had the introduction of the MSG-type four-speed; reverse on this transmission was to the right and back position. The TX SL sedan was voted &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year for 1975, and was the most popular four-cylinder car on the Australian market.

=== TC (1977–1978) ===

The TC Gemini was sold between March 1977 and April 1978. This model received a minor facelift from the TX, appearance was enhanced by a bolder vertical front grille, and at the rear, a silver garnish panel (as opposed to the TX&#x27;s black). A new Smiths-brand heater, defogger, and ventilation system was used, and the two small vents at each end of the dash were removed on this model, except on vehicles fitted with air conditioning.

A &quot;Fashion Pack&quot; interior was now available on both sedan and coupe models; this option was also upgraded to add steel-belted radials and a front stabilising bar. Door side-impact beams were introduced to improve safety, and SL coupes had a heated rear windscreen.

In April 1977, a limited-edition &quot;Sandpiper&quot; model was also offered in both sedan and coupe bodies. They were identified by a black grille with stainless steel top edge, gold pin stripes, chequered cloth seat inserts and door trims, wood-grain dash sections, radio/cassette player, a four-spoke steering wheel, and the A9R (Fashion Pack) suspension package. Externally, they were easily identified by the word &quot;Sandpiper&quot; and a bird decal on the side rear quarters of the coupe and on the rear doors of the sedans.

Gemini TC production totalled 17,257 units.

=== TD (1978–1979) ===


The TD series was introduced in April 1978, with the most major change over the TC being the introduction of &quot;radial tuned suspension&quot; and the option of a five-speed manual transmission. The differential was replaced with a small Salisbury unit as used in the UC Torana; it used tapered Timken wheel bearings as found on all larger Holdens since mid-1971. In April 1979, the rear brakes were changed to Commodore leading-trailing rear drum assemblies.

Exterior appearance was changed with the introduction of a new grille, rectangular headlights (round on base models), wheels were now , and the rear number plate was relocated in place of the rear garnish panel. A panel van and three-door wagon were also added to the range, bodywork pressings being from the British Vauxhall Chevette/Bedford Chevanne range.

Also new was the SL/E version, which used many interior options from the TC &quot;Sandpiper&quot; series, such as the radio/cassette, four-spoke steering wheel, timber dash inserts, velour seat trim, loop-pile carpet, and timber (hardboard) door-trim inserts. The SL/E also received the five-speed manual transmission as standard.

Externally, appearance was further enhanced to include stainless steel headlight and grille surrounds, thick stainless steel door window-frame mouldings, and GM-H designed alloy wheels similar to Sunbird SL/E. Coupes and sedans had colour-coded side mirrors similar to those of Sunbird SL/E and HZ Sandman, door-trims were extended to cover the top of the doors.

The SL/E was replaced by the SL/X in early 1979. It had a slightly lower equipment level, but a more competitive price. Also, a limited-edition &quot;Gypsy&quot; package was optional on panel vans, which included extra instrumentation and identifying decals.
Heated rear windscreens were now standard on all but base model sedans, panel vans, and wagons. Nylon plaid cloth inserts were available on SLs and wagons, and air conditioning was available as an optional accessory.

=== TE (1979–1982) ===
The TE series Gemini was introduced in October 1979. It featured significant exterior changes with new front and rear styling, comparable with the Isuzu Gemini and Holden Commodore models of the same era. By this time, the Opel Kadett had been changed to front wheel drive and no longer resembled the original Kadett C.

The TE was the most popular of all the Geminis, selling over 70,000 units. Initially only available as a sedan, in February 1980, the panel van and station wagon were added to the line-up, while the coupé version was no longer available. The luxury SL/E version was also removed from the line-up, replaced instead with an SL/X variant. In 1981, the TE was introduced to New Zealand, replacing the British-sourced Vauxhall Chevette range.

A limited-edition &quot;Gypsy&quot; van was made available in February 1980 and was offered with a tachometer and console gauges. Individual plaid cloth seats were available (a different plaid from other earlier Geminis). The Gypsy featured blacked-out grille treatment and door window surrounds, square headlights, full chrome bumpers, and full-length headlining and carpet (regular vans had vinyl flooring as standard). Gypsys are now a highly collectible Gemini model.

Engine options originally stayed the same. In early 1981, the option of a 1.8-litre Isuzu diesel model was introduced, fitted with an M76 five-speed gearbox. This one was also a strong seller in Indonesia, where it was mostly used as a taxi. In Australia, all diesel Geminis were only available as SL/X five-speed manuals. Rhone green was a colour made available exclusively for the diesel, but other colours in the range could be ordered. Production of the diesel commenced in March 1981.

=== TF (1982–1983) ===
The facelifted TF series Gemini was released in March 1982. It was offered in four-door sedan, three-door wagon, and two-door van variants. All models gained new grille treatments, and the SL/X variant received flush headlamps. The interior received major revisions with a new dashboard (creating the impression of more space in the vehicle) and a relocated steering column that put the steering wheel in line with the driver, rather than angled towards the centre of the car. The styling is often compared to the then-current VH Commodore range, but in fact the styling was introduced on the Isuzu Gemini in 1981 and carried across to the Australian model.
=== TG (1983–1984) ===
The TG series was released in March 1983. The SL and SL/X versions of TG had an appearance exactly like the TF SL/X, with the flush head lamps, plastic bumpers, and tail lights very similar to that on a VH Commodore. However, the base model of the TG continued the TF theme, with many examples now confused for TF models. Base-model vehicles had vinyl seats, no clock or cigarette lighter, and no console around the shifter. The engine continued to be the 1.6-litre as per previous versions, with the optional 1.8 diesel also available.

In 1983, a performance model, named the ZZ/Z (triple zed), was added. The ZZ/Z was always silver, with a body kit consisting of a front bar, wind splitters on top of the guards, a bobtail boot spoiler, alloy wheels, and blue and black ZZ/Z decals. The ZZ/Z was often thought to come with the twin-cam engine that was used in the Isuzu Gemini ZZ/R of the same era, but the ZZ/Z was strictly a cosmetic version and came with the standard running gear of other models. A five-speed manual gearbox was standard, with somewhat altered gearing; an automatic transmission was not available.

The Gemini was built in Holden&#x27;s Acacia Ridge plant, which closed in October 1984 after all Gemini production had come to a halt. However, wagon and panel-van production came to a gradual halt in mid-1984, as Vauxhall had ended production of the roof and the tailgate used on these models. Sourcing the parts from General Motors&#x27; Brazilian operation was considered, but was too complicated for the short time the model had left. Sales of the sedan continued into early 1985.
== Second generation ==
=== RB (1985–1987) ===
In May 1985, the RB series Gemini was released. Based on the front-wheel drive GM R platform, it did not sell as well as previous rear-wheel drive Geminis, with production totalling just 16,263 units. The RB Gemini was offered only in four-door sedan form, with SL/X and SL/E trim levels, as well as a fleet-only SL equipped with a 1.6 litre engine. Previous Gemini models had been built in the Holden facility at Acacia Ridge, but following that plant&#x27;s closure in 1984, the totally new RB series began production in the Holden plant at Elizabeth, South Australia.

The RB Gemini was discontinued in 1987 (production had ended sometime during 1986) due to poorer sales than its predecessor. The Gemini was at first sold side by side with the first generation hatch-only Holden Astra—a rebadged Nissan Pulsar (N12)—which was introduced in 1984; ultimately, the Astra effectively replaced the Gemini when its second generation, offered as both hatch and sedan, was launched in 1987.

The RB Gemini was notable for its 80-day, endurance run from a commercial in 1985, tested by a group of Australian racers including the late Peter Brock.


==Motorsport==
From 1977 through to 1982 Geminis raced in the Australian Touring Car Championship and the Bathurst 1000 and allied endurance motor racing. Occasionally the factory Holden Dealer Team would divert some of their efforts away from their Holden Torana and Holden Commodore racing efforts to race a Gemini, notably in 1982, but for the most part Geminis were race by privately funded teams. Initially they fared poorly in a 2000cc class but a 1600cc class was re-created in 1978 increasing their popularity. Despite the transition from Group C regulations to Group A in 1985 a few cars continued racing until 1986.

1980 saw the creation of the Gemini Racing Series in Queensland which continues to this day and is now the longest running one-make series in Australia and the second oldest globally after the British Mini series.

== Safety ==
In Australia, the 1982–1984 Holden Gemini was assessed in the &quot;Used Car Safety Ratings&quot; 2006 as providing &quot;significantly worse than average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.

<doc id="1138445" wikidata="Q993025" url="?curid=1138445" title="Padise Parish">
<text>Padise Parish () was a rural municipality in Harju County, north-western Estonia. It covered an area of 366.55 km2 and had a population of 1,771.

The administrative centre of Padise Parish was Padise village. It is located 47 km south-west from Estonia&#x27;s capital, Tallinn.

== History ==
The Padise name is first mentioned in the letter of the Danish king, which in 1283 confirmed the acquisition of the landed property for the future Cistercian Padise Abbey. In 1305 Eric VI of Denmark gave permission to the monks from Dünamünde to build a fortified monastery in Padise, the construction of which began in 1317. In 1343 - at the time of St. George&#x27;s Night Uprising - the first floor and part of the main floor walls were finished. The monastery was burnt down and 28 monks, lay brothers and German vassals were killed. The rebuilding of the monastery began only after 1370 and the consecration of the main building took place as late as 1448. The monastery ceased to exist in 1559 during the Livonian War.

== Local government ==
The mayor (&quot;&quot;) was Leemet Vaikmaa.

== Geography ==
=== Populated places ===
There were 24 villages (est: &quot;külad&quot;, sg. &quot;küla&quot;) in Padise Parish: Alliklepa, Altküla, Änglema, Audevälja, Harju-Risti, Hatu, Karilepa, Kasepere, Keibu, Kobru, Kõmmaste, Kurkse, Laane, Langa, Määra, Madise, Metslõugu, Padise, Pae, Pedase, Suurküla, Vihterpalu, Vilivalla, Vintse.

<doc id="1138460" wikidata="Q7381688" url="?curid=1138460" title="Russell Miller">
<text>Russell Miller (born  1938) is a British journalist and author of fifteen books, including biographies of Hugh Hefner, J. Paul Getty and L. Ron Hubbard.

While under contract to &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; he won four press awards and was voted Writer of the Year by the Society of British Magazine Editors. His book &quot;Magnum: Fifty Years at the Front Line of History: The Story of the Legendary Photo Agency&quot; (1999) on Magnum Photos, was described by John Simpson as &quot;the best book on photo-journalism I have ever read&quot;. His oral histories of D-Day, &quot;Nothing Less Than Victory&quot; (1993), and the SOE, &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; (2002) were widely acclaimed, both in Britain and in the United States.

==Life and work==

Miller was born in east London and began his career in journalism at the age of sixteen.

In the early 1980s, Miller decided to write a biographical trilogy on the subjects of sex, money, and religion. The books that followed were &quot;Bunny&quot; (on Hugh Hefner, published in 1984), &quot;The House of Getty&quot; (on J. Paul Getty, 1985), and &quot;Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard&quot; (on L. Ron Hubbard, 1987).

===L. Ron Hubbard biography===
In the 1980s Miller spent two years researching &quot;Bare-faced Messiah&quot;, a posthumous biography of the science-fiction author who had founded Scientology. The book challenges the official account of Hubbard&#x27;s life and work promoted by the Church of Scientology and it was serialised in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.
While researching the book in the United States, Miller was spied upon. His friends and business associates also received visits from Scientologists and private detectives. Attempts were made to frame him for the murder of a London private detective, the murder of American singer Dean Reed in East Berlin and a fire in an aircraft factory. Senior executives at publishers Michael Joseph, and at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and also a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, who worked for the Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; journalists that he had been offered &quot;large sums of money&quot; to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

<doc id="1138462" wikidata="Q3237979" url="?curid=1138462" title="Liberalism in Brazil">
<text>Liberalism in Brazil began around 1831, initially emerging as the opposition to conservatism. However, with the republican revolution of 1889, organized liberalism faded away. Liberal parties were established in the twentieth century and from 1966 onwards, the Democratic Movement became liberalism&#x27;s primary representative. As multi-partyism was established, more parties began to adopt the label of &quot;liberal&quot;, although the term was often used by moderate conservative factions. 

Three parties in Brazil identify themselves as liberal, but the Liberal Front Party (Partido da Frente Liberal) is conservative and a member of the International Democrat Union. The right-leaning Liberal Party (Partido Liberal) could be classified as a conservative-liberal party. The centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement (Movimento Democrático Brasileiro) occupies a liberal position on the political spectrum.

== Left-wing liberalism ==
Left-wing liberal movements in Brazil include some centrist parties and organizations rooted in socialism in the past, including Cidadania and Livres.

==The timeline==

*1868: The Progressive Party reunited with the party.

<doc id="1138463" wikidata="Q1993786" url="?curid=1138463" title="Richie Williams">
<text>Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Williams (born June 3, 1970) is an American soccer coach and former player who is currently the head coach of MLS Next Pro side New England Revolution II.

Known for his diminutive height and his dogged tackling, Williams spent the vast majority of his playing career in the United States, playing one season in the National Professional Soccer League, two in USISL, two in the USL A-League, and eight in Major League Soccer, most notably for D.C. United. He also earned 20 caps for the United States national team.

As a player, he won national championships at the youth (Union NJ Lancers, McGuire Cup U-19 in 1988), college (University of Virginia, NCAA Champions in 1989, 1991 and 1992), and professional (DC United, MLS Cups in 1996, 1997 and 1999) levels.

Since the end of his playing career, Williams has been involved in coaching, including as head coach of the U.S. Under-17 Men&#x27;s National Team and as an assistant coach in Major League Soccer for the New York Red Bulls and the New England Revolution.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Williams was born in Middletown Township, New Jersey and attended Mater Dei High School. Williams&#x27; career has been closely tied to Bruce Arena, former coach of the United States men&#x27;s national team. Arena first coached Williams at the University of Virginia. The two parted ways after Williams graduated. In 1992, Williams signed with Buffalo Blizzard in the National Professional Soccer League. He played thirty games for the Blizzard during the 1992-1993 winter indoor season. In the spring of 1993, he signed with the Richmond Kickers of the USISL. That fall, he moved to Ayr United in Scottish Football League but then came back to the United States, signing with the Richmond Kickers of the USISL in 1994. Williams played two seasons with the Kickers, helping them to the 1995 U.S. Open Cup and USISL titles.

===Major League Soccer===
In February 1996, Williams was drafted by D.C. United head coach Bruce Arena in the fourth round of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. Making up for his height with his ferocious shadowing of the opponent&#x27;s top playmaker, he became an integral member of the early DC teams, helping them to three MLS Cup titles.

Williams was traded to MetroStars for Mike Ammann in 2001, spent a year there and was sent back to D.C. for Brian Kamler. His MLS career ended with the Metros in a trade with Eddie Pope and Jaime Moreno for Mike Petke, a draft pick, and an allocation before the 2003 season. Williams tallied just eight goals and added 33 assists in 216 regular season games in MLS (plus two goals and four assists in 26 playoff games).

Williams signed with his original American team Richmond Kickers which then played in the USL A-League, prior to the 2004 season, but left the club in September 2005 after disagreements with the coach Leigh Cowlishaw, and retired from playing shortly thereafter.

==International career==
Williams earned his first cap for the United States on November 6, 1998, against Australia, and went on to appear 20 times for the national team.

==Coaching career==
Williams spent several years as an assistant coach at his alma mater, the University of Virginia, before being named an assistant coach with the MetroStars in January 2006. In June 2006, Williams was named interim head coach of the re-branded New York Red Bulls, and went back as assistant following former United States men&#x27;s national soccer team head coach Bruce Arena&#x27;s appointment with the club. He remained as the club&#x27;s top assistant coach, until he was once again called on to serve as the club&#x27;s interim coach replacing Juan Carlos Osorio for the remaining eight matches of the 2009 season.
Williams was retained by Red Bulls as an assistant coach for the 2010 season before being abruptly fired just three weeks before the start of the 2011 MLS season.

In October 2011, Williams was hired as the head coach of the U-18 national team. Three months later he was named head coach of the United States men&#x27;s national under-17 soccer team.
After the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup, Williams departed the program.

In January 2019, Williams was hired as the head coach of Loudoun United FC in the USL Championship. He left the team on May 30 to take a job as an assistant coach for the New England Revolution.

In August 2020 during the “MLS is Back Tournament” in a COVID-shortened season, Williams assumed head coaching duties of the New England Revolution for three games (a win and a tie, extending the team&#x27;s unbeaten streak to eight games) while Bruce Arena served a temporary suspension.

On August 1, 2023, the New England Revolution announced that Bruce Arena was placed on administrative leave amid allegations of &quot;insensitive and inappropriate remarks&quot;and that Williams would act as interim head coach pending a related league investigation. On September 12, 2023, it was announced that Clint Peay would be replacing Williams as interim head coach.

Williams was named head coach of the Revolution&#x27;s MLS Next Pro squad New England Revolution II on January 17, 2024.

<text>Brønnøysund () is a town and the administrative centre of Brønnøy Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The town has a population (2024) of 5,093 and a population density of .

It is also a former municipality within Nordland county. The village of Brønnøysund originally was declared a ladested in 1923 which made it an independent municipality. After merging with Brønnøy Municipality in 1964, it lost its town status. Then in 2000, it once again received town status. The town lies along the coast and is often called &quot;the coastal town in the middle of Norway.&quot; Brønnøysund is also the regional center of Southern Helgeland.

== History ==
During the Viking Age, &quot;Torgar&quot;, by the foot of the legendary mountain Torghatten, was a nationally powerful chieftain seat and an important commercial center along the coast. The original inhabitants were wiped out in an outright massacre by &quot;Duke Skule&quot; and his men in the Norwegian civil wars that raged around 1240, in the high medieval era of Norway.

The region was re-populated by immigrants from Southern Norway, Trøndelag, and Sweden, which could explain the unique dialect with a Swedish-like intonation.

In May 1945 &quot;the prisoners [foreign POWs] from Ylvingen&quot; were transported by ship from the harbour at Brønnøysund. (&quot;the song saved my life&quot;) documents the farewell to Igor Trapitsin and the other Soviet ex-POWs from the harbour at Brønnøysund.

===Name===
The town (and former municipality) is named &quot;Brønnøysund&quot; after the small island Brønnøya () since it is located on the island. The first element is which means &quot;well&quot; and the second element is which means &quot;island&quot;. The final element of the name is which means &quot;strait&quot;, referring to the strait of water that flows alongside the island and town. Islands with freshwater wells were important for seafarers.

===Municipal self-government (1923-1963)===
The village of Brønnøysund was established as a municipality on 1 January 1923 when it was separated from Brønnøy Municipality when it became a ladested (port town) and municipality of its own. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Brønnøysund (population: 2,064) was merged with Velfjord Municipality (population: 1,380), Sømna Municipality (population: 2,347), Brønnøy Municipality (population: 2,635), and the Lande-Tosen area of Bindal Municipality to form a new, enlarged Brønnøy Municipality. At that time, it lost its status as a ladested (town). In 2000, after some changes to Norwegian law, the municipality of Brønnøy designated Brønnøysund as a town once again.

Prior to its dissolution in 1964, the municipality was the 652nd largest by area out of the 689 municipalities in Norway. Brønnøysund Municipality was the 439th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of about 1,991.

<text>Pilawa () is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by many noble families known as &quot;szlachta&quot; in Polish in medieval Poland and later under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, branches of the original medieval Piława Clan (&quot;Pilawici&quot;) family as well as families connected with the Clan by adoption.

==History==
The progenitor of the Pilawa Clan was supposed to have been Żyrosław z Potoka, who was fighting the Prussians, a pagan tribe and brought himself glory in the Battle of Piława, where he fought along Bolesław IV the Curly. The legend states that Żyrosław reached the pagan chief, fought him in hand-to-hand combat and killed him. The terrified enemy hordes fled the battle field. The related legend tells also that in 1166, to commemorate the victory, Bolesław IV bestowed a coat of arms upon Żyrosław, naming it for the place, where the battle took place.

==Blazon==

The Pilawa coat of arms assumed its final form in the late 14th century. Formerly, there were two differing patterns, and the records from the years 1387, 1388 and 1389 mention that it had to be a letter &quot;Z&quot; with two and a half of a cross, or an arrow with two and a half of a cross.

==Family name changes during the Second World War and 1944–1953==

The communist government of Poland was in deep opposition to every rich (specially noble) family. Hundreds of Potockis were killed by NKVD and Red Army. Many Potockis, who decided to stay in Poland were forced to change their family names (otherwise they could be killed, imprisoned or have other problems).

The most popular changes was from Potocki to Nowak, Kowalski, Gnejowicz, Stanisławski, Pryszkiewicz, Wszelaki, Petecki, Blacha, Musiał, Woldan, Walera, Melka, Madej and Pastuch.
