<text>The 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Interlagos on 28 March 1993. It was the second race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race was won by local hero Ayrton Senna, driving a McLaren-Ford, with Briton Damon Hill second in a Williams-Renault and German Michael Schumacher third in a Benetton-Ford. Senna&#x27;s victory marked McLaren&#x27;s 100th race win in Formula One. Senna was the last Brazilian driver to win his home race until Felipe Massa in 2006.

===Qualifying===
Brazil was Senna&#x27;s home race but he was able to do nothing to prevent the Williamses being 1–2 in qualifying with Prost on pole ahead of Hill. Senna was third ahead of Schumacher, Andretti and Patrese.

===Race===
At the start, Senna got ahead of Hill but Andretti hit Berger with both crashing hard in the tyre barrier in turn 1. Both of them along with Brundle and Fabrizio Barbazza&#x27;s Minardi were out. The order was: Prost, Senna, Hill, a fast starting Jean Alesi, Schumacher, and Lehto.

Schumacher passed Alesi on lap 2, but his teammate Patrese only lasted until the fourth lap when his suspension failed. While Prost built up a substantial lead, Senna was under pressure from Hill who took second on lap 11. On lap 25, Senna was issued a stop-go penalty for lapping a backmarker under yellow flags and dropped behind Schumacher. There was a heavy rain shower, and many drivers pitted for wet tyres, including Senna, Schumacher and Hill, while Prost stayed out on slick tyres. Several drivers spun, with both Ukyo Katayama and Aguri Suzuki crashing on the start–finish straight on lap 27, the Footwork partially blocking the circuit and bringing out the safety car – the second time this had been seen in Formula 1 following its trial at the 1973 Canadian Grand Prix. Fittipaldi spun at the first corner on lap 30 with his car stopped in the middle of the track. With the rain coming down harder, Prost lost control and, unable to avoid Fittipaldi&#x27;s car, crashed into him, taking them both out of the race. As the wreckage was cleared, the new safety car controlled the field, Hill led Senna, Schumacher (who had lost time during his pit stop because his car fell off the jack), Alesi, Johnny Herbert, and Lehto. They were followed by Alessandro Zanardi, Philippe Alliot, Mark Blundell, Derek Warwick, rookie Luca Badoer, Karl Wendlinger, Andrea de Cesaris, Érik Comas, and Michele Alboreto.

The rain stopped and the safety car went in, and the order stayed as listed. The sun then came out, it began to dry rapidly and everyone stopped for dry tyres. Johnny Herbert had pitted for slicks right when the safety car pulled back into the pits, and he was to move up to third place due to this early change back to slicks.

Just after the tyre stops Senna passed Hill for the lead and pulled away. Behind, Schumacher and Alesi had stop-go penalties for passing under yellow flags, Schumacher dropping to fifth and Alesi going down to ninth. Schumacher passed Blundell and then Herbert to take third. Senna won from Hill, Schumacher, Herbert, Blundell and Alessandro Zanardi. After the race, several Brazilian fans invaded the circuit in celebration of Senna’s victory (similar to the English fans at the British Grand Prix of the previous year with Nigel Mansell).

<text>The 1993 European Grand Prix (formally the Sega European Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 11 April 1993 at Donington Park. It was the third race of the 1993 FIA Formula One World Championship. The race was contested over 76 laps and was won by Ayrton Senna for the McLaren team, ahead of second-placed Damon Hill and third-placed Alain Prost, both driving for the Williams team.

Senna&#x27;s drive to victory is regarded as one of his finest, and his first lap exploits are particularly lauded, in which he passed four drivers – Michael Schumacher, Karl Wendlinger, Damon Hill and Alain Prost – to take the lead in a single lap in damp conditions. The race was the first held under the European Grand Prix title since 1985, and to date is the only Formula One Grand Prix to have been held at the Donington Park circuit.

==Report==

===Background===
After plans to hold an Asian Grand Prix at the Nippon Autopolis in Japan failed to materialise, the first European Grand Prix for eight years was run as the third race of the 1993 season. Donington Park was awarded the race, having unsuccessfully bid to host the British Grand Prix. Video game company Sega sponsored the race and the logo could be seen throughout the Grand Prix and on the podium. Sega also had naming rights to the Grand Prix.

Ivan Capelli had agreed to part ways with the Jordan team after failing to qualify at the previous round in Brazil. He was replaced by veteran Belgian driver Thierry Boutsen.

===Race===

The Williams cars were 1–2 in qualifying with Prost on pole ahead of Hill, Schumacher, Senna, Wendlinger and Michael Andretti. At the start, it was damp and Schumacher blocked Senna and both lost time and Wendlinger took third. Having dropped to fifth, Senna quickly passed Schumacher at the third corner. He then went after Wendlinger, passing him through the Craner Curves with Schumacher and Andretti trying to follow through. Schumacher went through but Andretti hit Wendlinger and both were out, meaning Andretti was still yet to complete a racing lap in his Formula One career. Senna went after Hill now and took second at McLean&#x27;s Corner. Now Prost was the target and the lead was taken at the penultimate corner – the Melbourne Hairpin. Going into the second lap, Senna led Prost, Hill, Rubens Barrichello (who had started 12th), Jean Alesi, Schumacher and JJ Lehto.

The track began to dry and everyone pitted for dry tyres. Lehto was fifth, having started from the pit lane, but he retired with handling problems on lap 14. Gerhard Berger took the place but he too retired with suspension problems six laps later. The rain returned and the leaders now pitted for wets. Mark Blundell was forced off by Senna whilst battling Fittipaldi at the Esses and then spun off backwards into the gravel trap whilst attempting to rejoin the track. Schumacher stayed out and was leading but spun out on lap 23 as a result of being on the wrong tyres. The track began to dry and everyone pitted once again with Senna having a problem and losing 20 seconds. Prost now led Senna, Hill, Barrichello, Derek Warwick and Johnny Herbert.

It began to rain and the two Williams stopped for wets while Senna stayed out. It was the correct decision because it began to dry again. The Williams stopped yet again for dries. Prost stalled in the pits in his stop and when he rejoined, he was a lap behind and down in fourth. Barrichello was now second but it rained and then stopped again. He went to the pits twice and by now Hill was in second, albeit a lap down. Barrichello, third, had trouble with his fuel pressure and retired, giving the place to Prost. Senna set the fastest lap on lap 57, on a lap when he drove into the pit lane but aborted the pit stop, showing that there actually was a shortcut through the pit lane. This is due to the Grand Prix configuration of Donington, which has the pit entry before the final hairpin corner onto the start/finish straight.

Senna won from Hill and Prost, having made four pit stops in the wet-dry conditions compared to Prost&#x27;s seven. Williams technical director Patrick Head explained: &quot;Our active car maintained very low ride heights, just a few millimetres above the ground, and gained aerodynamic performance by this, but when the water was deeper than the ride height of the car, our drivers were &#x27;surfing&#x27;&quot;. Herbert finished fourth for Lotus, stopping only once, while all the other finishing drivers making several pit stops. Riccardo Patrese and Fabrizio Barbazza completed the top six. By the end, Senna had lapped the entire field except for Hill, who finished over a minute behind.

At the end of the race, Senna was led onto a podium and given a trophy that depicted Sega&#x27;s mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, holding a trophy with the Sega logo underneath. A widely circulated image shows Senna holding the trophy. After this marketing photo op, he was given the official award, a trophy that does not depict either Sonic the Hedgehog or the Sega logo. McLaren is still in possession of the Sega trophy; for a long time, it was thought to have been lost until McLaren&#x27;s official Twitter account revealed it is in one of their storerooms. On 12 June 2020, McLaren put the trophy in a trophy case in McLaren Technology Center.

<text>Lord Brocktree is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 2000. It is the 13th book in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series to be published. It is the earliest chronological installment in the series, and the last prequel written by Jacques.

==Synopsis==
The book focuses on a badger, Lord Brocktree, and haremaid Dotti as they journey towards Salamandastron, the mountain fortress of badger lords, to recapture it from the wildcat Ungatt Trunn.

==Plot summary==

This book revolves around the Eurasian badger Lord Brocktree, father of Boar the Fighter, grandfather of Bella of Brockhall, and great-grandfather of Sunflash the Mace. He sets out to find the ancient badger mountain stronghold of Salamandastron, aided by the quick talking haremaid Dorothea Duckfontein Dillworthy and European otter Ruffgar Brookback.

Meanwhile, in Salamandastron, trouble comes for Brocktree&#x27;s father, Lord Stonepaw. Years of peace have left the mountain stronghold with few fighters, and those that remain are long past their prime, including Stonepaw himself. The European wildcat Ungatt Trunn, son of Mortspear, Highland King of the North, lays siege to the fortress with his Blue Hordes. Eventually the mountain is overrun, leading to the deaths of many hares and even of Stonepaw himself, who dies valiantly defending his hares, taking many vermin with him as he does. The wildcat takes at least sixty hares as prisoners, but through the efforts of warrior Stiffener Medick and his otter friend Brogalaw, they escape.

Lord Brocktree gets an army from the hare Bucko Bigbones, after Dotti defeats him in a contest.

Thanks to the Bark Crew, the group of guerrillas formed by Stiffener and Brogalaw to harass Trunn, the Blue Hordes are slowly starved, their supplies cut off. Ungatt Trunn tricks the Bark Crew into putting up a last stand in battle, but Lord Brocktree joins forces with the hares and saves the day.

The book culminates in a massive final battle, with many memorable characters killed, including Jukka and Fleetscut. Eventually, when the battle ends up a near-stalemate, Trunn and Brocktree face off in a duel. After a failed assassination attempt on Brocktree by the searats Ripfang and Doomeye and the corsair fleet captain Karangool (Trunn&#x27;s second in command) the badger eventually wins, snapping Trunn&#x27;s spine and leaving him on the sand to die. Trunn is thrown into the water but survives, only to be drowned by Groddil, one of his former advisors. The book ends with thousands of hares rallying to form the Long Patrol under Brocktree and Dotti (whom the badger names first Long Patrol General).

<doc id="1123160" wikidata="Q2660855" url="?curid=1123160" title="Gregg v. Georgia">
<text>Gregg v. Georgia, Proffitt v. Florida, Jurek v. Texas, Woodson v. North Carolina, and Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 153 (1976), is a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. It reaffirmed the Court&#x27;s acceptance of the use of the death penalty in the United States, upholding, in particular, the death sentence imposed on Troy Leon Gregg. The set of cases is referred to by a leading scholar as the July 2 Cases, and elsewhere referred to by the lead case Gregg. The court set forth the two main features that capital sentencing procedures must employ in order to comply with the Eighth Amendment ban on &quot;cruel and unusual punishments&quot;. The decision essentially ended the &quot;de facto&quot; moratorium on the death penalty imposed by the Court in its 1972 decision in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972). Justice Brennan&#x27;s dissent famously argued that &quot;The calculated killing of a human being by the State involves, by its very nature, a denial of the executed person&#x27;s humanity... An executed person has indeed &#x27;lost the right to have rights.&#x27;&quot;

==Background==
===Cases===
All five cases share the same basic procedural history. After the &quot;Furman&quot; decision, the states of Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana amended their death penalty statutes to meet the &quot;Furman&quot; guidelines. Subsequently, the five named defendants were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in their respective states. The respective state supreme courts upheld the death sentence. The defendants then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review their death sentence, asking the Court to go beyond &quot;Furman&quot; and declare once and for all the death penalty to be &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; and thus in violation of the Constitution; the Court agreed to hear the cases.

In the July 2 Cases, the Court&#x27;s goal was to provide guidance to states in the wake of &quot;Furman&quot;. In &quot;Furman&quot; only one basic idea could command a majority vote of the Justices: capital punishment, as then practiced in the United States, was cruel and unusual punishment because there were no rational standards that determined when it was imposed and when it was not. The question the Court resolved in these cases was not whether the death sentence imposed on each of the individual defendants was cruel, but rather whether the process by which those sentences were imposed was rational and objectively reviewable.

===Capital punishment and the Eighth Amendment===
The defendants in each of the five cases urged the Court to go further than it had in &quot;Furman&quot; by holding once and for all that capital punishment was cruel and unusual punishment that violated the Eighth Amendment. However the Court responded that &quot;The most marked indication of society&#x27;s endorsement of the death penalty for murder is the legislative response to &quot;Furman&quot;.&quot; Both Congress and 35 states had complied with the Court&#x27;s dictates in &quot;Furman&quot; by either specifying factors to be weighed and procedures to be followed when imposing a death sentence, or dictating that the death penalty would be mandatory for specific crimes. Furthermore, a referendum in California had overturned the California Supreme Court&#x27;s earlier decision (&quot;California v. Anderson&quot;) holding that the death penalty violated the California constitution. The fact that juries remained willing to impose the death penalty also contributed to the Court&#x27;s conclusion that American society did not believe in 1976 that the death penalty was unconstitutional.

The Court also found that the death penalty &quot;comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the [Eighth] Amendment&quot;. The death penalty serves two principal social purposes—retribution and deterrence. &quot;In part, capital punishment is an expression of society&#x27;s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct&quot;. But this outrage must be expressed in an ordered fashion, for America is a society of laws. Retribution is consistent with human dignity, because society believes that &quot;certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death&quot;. And although it is difficult to determine statistically how much crime the death penalty actually deters, the Court found that in 1976 there was &quot;no convincing empirical evidence&quot; supporting either the view that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime or the opposite view. Still, the Court could not completely discount the possibility that for certain &quot;carefully contemplated murderers&quot;, &quot;the possible penalty of death may well enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act&quot;.

Finally, the Court considered whether the death penalty is &quot;disproportionate in relation to the crime for which it is imposed&quot;. Although death is severe and irrevocable, the Court could not say that death was always disproportionate to the crime of deliberately taking human life. &quot;It is an extreme sanction, suitable to the most extreme of crimes.&quot;

===Historical disapproval of mandatory death sentences===
The Court was determined to simultaneously save capital punishment in the United States and impose some reasoned basis for carrying it out. That reasoning flows from the Eighth Amendment&#x27;s cruel and unusual punishment clause. Although capital punishment, per se, was not found by the Court to be cruel and unusual, it must still be carried out in a manner consistent with the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. In the Court&#x27;s view, the country&#x27;s history with capital punishment suggests that those evolving standards of decency could not tolerate a return to the mandatory death penalty for murder that had prevailed in medieval England.

In 18th century Britain, the penalty for a vast number of serious crimes, including murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If the jury has only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished &quot;somehow&quot;, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.

To mitigate the harshness of the common-law rule, Pennsylvania divided murder into &quot;degrees&quot; in 1794. First-degree murder, a capital crime, was limited to all &quot;willful, deliberate, and premeditated&quot; murders. All other murder was second-degree murder, and not a capital crime. This development eased the tension created by the common-law mandatory death penalty, but some juries still refused to convict defendants who were clearly guilty of first-degree murder because that crime carried a mandatory death penalty.

Recognizing that juries in capital cases found discretion in sentencing desirable, Tennessee, Alabama, and Louisiana afforded their juries this discretion in the 1840s. Finally, the jury could respond to mitigating factors about the crime or the criminal and withhold the death penalty even for convicted first-degree murderers. This development spread, and by 1900, 23 states and the federal government had discretionary sentencing in capital cases. Fourteen more states followed in the first two decades of the 20th century, and by 1963, all death-penalty jurisdictions employed discretionary sentencing.

==Decision of the Court==
The Court set out two broad guidelines that legislatures must follow in order to craft a constitutional capital sentencing scheme:
*First, the scheme must provide objective criteria to direct and limit the death sentencing discretion. The objectiveness of these criteria must in turn be ensured by appellate review of all death sentences.
*Second, the scheme must allow the sentencer (whether judge or jury) to take into account the character and record of an individual defendant.

In &quot;Gregg&quot;, &quot;Proffitt&quot;, and &quot;Jurek&quot;, the Court found that the capital sentencing schemes of Georgia, Florida, and Texas, respectively, met these criteria; whereas in &quot;Woodson&quot; and &quot;Roberts&quot;, the Court found that the sentencing schemes of North Carolina and Louisiana did not.

===Constitutional sentencing procedures===
The proposition that the death penalty was not always cruel and unusual punishment was just the beginning of the discussion. &quot;Furman&quot; had held that &quot;where discretion is afforded a sentencing body on a matter so grave as the determination of whether a human life should be taken or spared, that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.&quot; The question the Court confronted in these five cases was whether the procedures crafted by Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana adequately minimized that risk. In all five cases, the Court&#x27;s primary focus was on the jury.

Although in most criminal cases the judge decides and imposes the sentence, &quot;jury sentencing has been considered desirable in capital cases in order to maintain a link between contemporary community values and the penal system—a link without which the determination of punishment could hardly reflect the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.&quot; The drafters of the Model Penal Code concluded that the now-familiar bifurcated procedure, in which the jury first considers the question of guilt without regard to punishment, and then determines whether the punishment should be death or life imprisonment, is the preferable model. This was the model that the Court approved in these cases—although it tacitly approved a model without any jury involvement in the sentencing process, an approval that persisted until 2002&#x27;s &quot;Ring v. Arizona&quot;.

The drawback of having juries rather than judges fix the penalty in capital cases is the risk that they will have no frame of reference for imposing the death penalty in a rational manner. Although this problem may not be totally correctible, the Court trusted that the guidance given the jury by the aggravating factors or other special-verdict questions would assist it in deciding on a sentence. The drafters of the Model Penal Code &quot;concluded that it is within the realm of possibility to point to the main circumstances of aggravation and mitigation that should be weighed and weighed against each other when they are presented in a concrete case.&quot; For the Court, these factors adequately guarded against the risk of arbitrary imposition of the death sentence.

Every death sentence involves first an &quot;eligibility&quot; determination and then a &quot;selection&quot; of an eligible defendant for the death penalty. A defendant is eligible for the death penalty once the jury has concluded that he is a member of that narrow class of criminal defendants who have committed the most morally outrageous of crimes. An eligible defendant is then selected for the death penalty after the sentencer takes into account mitigating evidence about the character and record of the defendant in order to decide whether that individual is worthy of a death sentence.

In addition to jury sentencing through the guidance of aggravating factors, a constitutional capital sentencing scheme must provide for appellate review of the death sentence, typically by the state&#x27;s supreme court. This review must not be a rubber stamp; there must be evidence in the state&#x27;s decisional law that the court takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that the sentence imposed was not arbitrary. Currently, those states which still maintain a death penalty option have a mandatory appeal of the sentence (defendants sentenced to death cannot waive this appeal, but can waive appeals beyond this stage subject to a competency hearing).

With &quot;Gregg&quot; and the companion cases, the Court approved three different schemes that had sufficiently narrow eligibility criteria and at the same time sufficiently broad discretion in selection. By contrast, the two schemes the Court disapproved had overly broad eligibility criteria and then no discretion in sentencing.

==Capital punishment schemes approved by the Court==

===Georgia===
Under the Georgia scheme (which generally followed the Model Penal Code), after the defendant was convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, a capital crime (under the first part of the bifurcated trial proceeding), the second part of the bifurcated trial involved an additional hearing at which the jury received additional evidence in aggravation and mitigation. In order for the defendant to be eligible for the death penalty, the jury needed to find the existence of &quot;one&quot; of ten aggravating factors:

# The defendant has previously been convicted of a capital felony or has a history of committing serious felonies.
# The capital felony was committed while the defendant was committing another capital felony.
# The defendant created a grave risk of death to others.
# The defendant committed the crime for the purpose of receiving money or anything else of value.
# The defendant killed a judge or prosecutor exercising his official duties.
# The defendant hired a killer.
# The crime was &quot;outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim.&quot;
# The defendant killed a police officer, prison guard, or fireman in the line of duty.
# The offense was committed by someone who had escaped from prison.
# The offense was committed for the purpose of avoiding arrest.

Once the jury found that one or more of the aggravating factors existed beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant would be eligible for the death penalty. The jury may, but was not required to, then evaluate all the evidence it had heard, including mitigating evidence and other aggravating evidence not supporting one of the ten factors beyond a reasonable doubt—and decide whether the defendant should live or die. This scheme is called a &quot;non-weighing&quot; scheme, because the sentencer is not required to weigh the statutory aggravating factors against mitigating evidence before imposing a death sentence.

The Court found that, because of the jury&#x27;s finding at least one aggravating factor was a prerequisite for imposing the death penalty, Georgia&#x27;s scheme adequately narrowed the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. Although there was admittedly some discretion as to the mitigation phase, that discretion is channeled in an objective way, and therefore provided for individualized sentencing. Thus, Georgia&#x27;s death penalty scheme complied with the &quot;Furman&quot; requirements and was thus approved by the Court.

===Florida===
Florida&#x27;s scheme differed from Georgia&#x27;s in two respects. First, at the sentencing hearing of a capital felon, the jury determined whether one or more aggravating factors exist, drawing on a list very similar to Georgia&#x27;s. Then the jury was specifically asked to weigh the mitigating evidence presented against the statutory aggravating factors that have been proved. This scheme is called a &quot;weighing&quot; scheme.

Second, the jury&#x27;s role was only advisory; the judge could disregard the jury&#x27;s sentencing recommendation, but had to explain the reasoning if they did. Under Florida law, if the jury recommended life but the judge imposed a death sentence, &quot;the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.&quot; The trial judge must independently reweigh the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors.

The Court concluded that, as the sentencer&#x27;s discretion was limited in an objective fashion and directed in a reviewable manner, Florida&#x27;s scheme also adequately narrowed the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. The Court noted that Florida&#x27;s scheme came closest to the Model Penal Code&#x27;s recommendation of an ideal sentencing scheme, as it used a weighing scheme whereas Georgia&#x27;s scheme did not, thus allowing for individual sentencing. Thus, Florida&#x27;s death penalty scheme also complied with the &quot;Furman&quot; requirements and was thus also approved by the Court.

===Texas===
Texas&#x27;s scheme differed considerably from that suggested by the Model Penal Code and followed in large part by Georgia and Florida. In order to narrow the class of death penalty-eligible defendants as required by &quot;Furman&quot;, the Texas Legislature did not adopt the &quot;aggravating factors&quot; approach outlined by the Model Penal Code. Instead, it chose to modify and severely narrow the legal definition of &quot;capital murder&quot;, thus requiring certain objective elements to be present before one could be charged with capital murder and thus eligible for the death penalty. The 1976 law defined capital murder in Texas as involving one of the five situations:
*murder of a police officer or fireman;
*murder committed in the course of committing kidnapping, burglary, robbery, rape, or arson;
*murder committed for remuneration (contract killing);
*murder committed while escaping or attempting to escape from a penal institution; and
*murder committed by a prison inmate when the victim is a prison employee.

If the defendant was convicted of capital murder, and if the prosecution sought the death penalty (which it has never been required to do in Texas), the second part of the bifurcated trial required the jury to consider two (or sometimes three) &quot;special issues&quot;:
*whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result;
*whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society (under Texas law, &quot;society&quot; was defined as both inside and outside of the prison system; thus, a defendant who would pose a threat to persons inside prison – such as other inmates or correctional officers – would be eligible for the death penalty); and
*if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.
If all applicable special issues were answered in the affirmative, then the result would be an automatic death sentence; if any special issue was not answered in the affirmative, the sentence would be life imprisonment.

The Court concluded that Texas&#x27;s narrow legal definition of capital murder served the same purpose as the aggravating factors in the Georgia and Florida schemes, that being to adequately narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty. The Court even observed that &quot;the principal difference between Texas and the other two States [Georgia and Florida] is that the death penalty is an available sentencing option – even potentially – for a smaller class of murders in Texas&quot;.

However, the special issues feature and its automatic death sentence imposition (if all were answered in the affirmative) was the key issue in the Court&#x27;s analysis. In its review, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (the state&#x27;s highest criminal court, to which all death sentences in Texas are automatically and directly appealed) indicated that the &quot;continuing threat to society&quot; special issue would allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the jury. The Court concluded that this special issue would allow for the same extensive consideration of mitigating evidence as the Georgia and Florida schemes. Thus, Texas&#x27;s death penalty scheme, though considerably different from Florida&#x27;s and Georgia&#x27;s, also complied with the &quot;Furman&quot; requirements and was thus also approved by the Court.

The defendant in this case, Jerry Jurek (TDCJ #508), would ultimately see his sentence commuted to life in prison. Texas would later amend its three questions, keeping the &quot;continuing threat to society&quot; question, adding a second question specifically dealing with mitigating evidence, and adding a third question applicable only if the defendant was convicted as an accessory.

==Capital punishment schemes rejected by the Court==

===North Carolina===
In 1974, the North Carolina General Assembly (similar to the approach taken by the Texas Legislature) chose to adopt a narrow definition of &quot;first-degree murder&quot; which would be eligible for the death penalty, which was defined as:

:murder perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony.

North Carolina had also enacted a mandatory death penalty for first-degree rape, but the Court later ruled in &quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot; that rape is not a capital crime, at least where the victim is not killed; the statutes mandating death penalty for first-degree arson and first-degree burglary were abrogated by the General Assembly.

The North Carolina Supreme Court had ruled that its capital sentencing scheme could survive &quot;Furman&quot; analysis if the legislature removed the discretionary sentencing provision. However, it was the lack of discretion in sentencing that the Court used to rule the scheme unconstitutional.

===Louisiana===
In 1973, the Louisiana Legislature adopted the approach taken by North Carolina, by redefining first-degree murder as the killing of a human being in one of five circumstances:

# when the offender has a specific intent to kill and is engaged in the perpetration of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated rape, or armed robbery;
# when the offender has a specific intent to kill a fireman or police officer engaged in the performance of his duties;
# when the offender has a specific intent to kill and has previously been convicted of an unrelated murder or is serving a life sentence;
# when the offender has a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm on more than one person; and
# when the offender has a specific intent to kill and has been offered or has received anything of value for committing the murder

Also, unlike North Carolina, Louisiana law required the jury in all first-degree murder cases to be instructed on second-degree murder and manslaughter, crimes ineligible for the death penalty.

Although Louisiana had created a class of death-eligible crimes somewhat narrower than North Carolina had, it still had a mandatory death penalty for a significant range of crimes, which were aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping and treason; the lack of discretion in sentencing caused the Louisiana scheme to suffer the same unconstitutional infirmities as North Carolina&#x27;s.

==Other views expressed in these cases==
Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall expressed their views, which they also articulated in &quot;Furman&quot;, that the death penalty does not deter crime and that American society has evolved to the point that it is no longer an appropriate vehicle for expressing retribution. In every subsequent capital case that would come before the Court during their tenures, they would refer to their opinions in &quot;Gregg&quot; in support of their vote against the death penalty.

Justice Byron White countered that capital punishment cannot be unconstitutional because the Constitution expressly mentions it and because two centuries of Court decisions assumed that it was constitutional. Furthermore, for White the judgment of the legislatures of 35 states was paramount, and suggested that the punishment should remain in use. He also felt that the Court should defer to a state legislature&#x27;s response to the problem of juror response to the prospect of capital punishment, rather than dictate that the Eighth Amendment requires a particular response. White also disagreed that the Constitution required a separate penalty hearing before imposing the death penalty. &quot;Even if the character of the accused must be considered under the Eighth Amendment, surely a State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide that the commission of certain crimes conclusively establishes that the criminal&#x27;s character is such that he deserves death.&quot; He also saw no difference between Louisiana&#x27;s definition of first-degree murder and Texas&#x27;s definition of capital murder.

Justice William Rehnquist would have upheld North Carolina&#x27;s and Louisiana&#x27;s mandatory death penalties. He disputed the historical evidence adduced in support of the claim that American juries dislike mandatory death penalties. He also felt that the Court&#x27;s decisions had an analytical flaw. The Court had struck down the mandatory death penalty because it took away discretion from the jury. Yet, Rehnquist pointed out, a jury in Georgia could reject the death penalty for no reason at all. Thus, Georgia&#x27;s scheme did not alleviate the concerns articulated in &quot;Furman&quot; about the arbitrariness of the death penalty any more than North Carolina&#x27;s ignored them. He also disputed whether the appellate review of death sentences inherent in the systems the Court had approved could truly ensure that each death sentence satisfied those concerns. He finally took issue with the idea that the fact that &quot;death is different&quot; requires any extra safeguards in the sentencing process.

==Aftermath==
Utah was the first state to resume executions after capital punishment was reinstated in the United States in 1976, when Gary Gilmore was executed by a firing squad on January 17, 1977. Following his conviction and death sentence, Gilmore insisted he wanted to be executed, and for this reason some consider the national moratorium to have only ended in 1979 with electrocution of John Spenkelink, who resisted his execution.

The July 2 Cases mark the beginning of the United States&#x27; modern legal conversation about the death penalty. Major subsequent developments include forbidding the death penalty for rape (&quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot;, &quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot;), restricting the death penalty in cases of felony murder (&quot;Enmund v. Florida&quot;), exempting the mentally handicapped (&quot;Atkins v. Virginia&quot;) and juvenile murderers (&quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot;) from the death penalty, removing virtually all limitations on the presentation of mitigating evidence (&quot;Lockett v. Ohio&quot;, &quot;Holmes v. South Carolina&quot;), requiring precision in the definition of aggravating factors (&quot;Godfrey v. Georgia&quot;, &quot;Walton v. Arizona&quot;), and requiring the jury to decide whether aggravating factors have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt (&quot;Ring v. Arizona&quot;).

&quot;Gregg&quot; has been described as a &quot;judicial surrender to political pressure&quot;. In the wake of the &quot;Furman&quot; decision, 35 states reenacted death penalty statutes. There was a significant shift in the attitudes towards capital punishment between &quot;Furman&quot; and &quot;Gregg&quot;; in 1972, when &quot;Furman&quot; was decided, public support for the death penalty was around 50 percent. By the time &quot;Gregg&quot; was decided, a mere four years later in 1976, 66 percent of the public favored capital punishment.

In a 2010 interview with Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Justice John Paul Stevens remarked that there was not one case on which he would vote differently today, &quot;with one exception... the Texas death-penalty case [&quot;Jurek v. Texas&quot;].&quot; He went on to say that &quot;we made a mistake in that case...I think upon reflection, we should have held the Texas statute... unconstitutional.&quot; Two years earlier, Stevens had come out in opposition to the death penalty, writing that his vote in the &quot;Gregg&quot; cases had been made out of respect for precedent within the court that held capital punishment to be constitutional.

<text>The 1993 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 25 April 1993. It was the fourth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 61-lap race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from pole position. Prost&#x27;s British teammate, Damon Hill, led the early stages of the race before suffering a brake failure. German Michael Schumacher finished second in a Benetton-Ford, with another Briton, Martin Brundle, third in a Ligier-Renault.

==Qualifying report==
Alain Prost maintained his record of taking pole position for every race in 1993, beating Williams teammate Damon Hill by just under a tenth of a second. Michael Schumacher was third in his Benetton, albeit 1.8 seconds behind Prost, with Ayrton Senna fourth in his McLaren. Less than two-tenths of a second separated the drivers from fifth to eleventh: Karl Wendlinger in the Sauber, Michael Andretti in the second McLaren, Mark Blundell in the Ligier, the two Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi, Martin Brundle in the second Ligier, and Riccardo Patrese in the second Benetton. The non-qualifier was Michele Alboreto in the Lola.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
At the start, Prost was passed by Hill and Senna (who had already got ahead of Schumacher). Hill led Senna, Prost, Schumacher, Wendlinger and Andretti at the end of lap 1.

Hill pulled away quickly while Senna held up Prost. Prost passed Senna on lap 8 and set off after Hill. It was time for the stops and Senna got ahead of Prost in these stops. On lap 17, Prost audaciously overtook both Hill and Senna at Tosa in the presence of backmarkers. At the same time, Senna got ahead of Hill. Hill didn&#x27;t last long, retiring with brake failure on lap 21. Both McLarens soon went out, Andretti from fifth on lap 33 by spinning off and Senna from second on lap 43 with a hydraulic failure. In between, Alesi, who took fifth after Andretti&#x27;s spin retired with clutch failure. After being held up by Suzuki&#x27;s Footwork, a large battle took place between Lehto and the two Lotuses of Herbert and Zanardi. Zanardi locked his front brakes into the final chicane, overshooting and ripping an oil line. Rejoining the circuit with the rear of the car on fire, he shortly retired on the approach to Tamburello. 

Schumacher was now second and Wendlinger was third but Wendlinger retired with engine failure on lap 49, giving third to Brundle. Prost won from Schumacher, Brundle, Lehto, Philippe Alliot and Barbazza.

<text>The 1993 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 9 May 1993 at the Circuit de Catalunya. It was the fifth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship. The 65-lap race was won from pole position by Alain Prost, driving a Williams-Renault, with Ayrton Senna second in a McLaren-Ford and Michael Schumacher third in a Benetton-Ford. This was the only time Prost, Senna and Schumacher shared the podium together. 

The Williams-Renaults filled the front row in qualifying, with Prost ahead of Hill, Senna, Schumacher, Patrese and Wendlinger. At the start, Hill got ahead of Prost with no changes behind. Hill was leading Prost, Senna, Schumacher, Patrese and Wendlinger.

Hill and Prost pulled away from the rest with Prost taking the lead on lap 11. Later in the race Prost&#x27;s car began to handle oddly and Hill closed up on him, attempting to re-overtake the Frenchman, only to retire when his engine failed on lap 41. Schumacher and Senna both pitted for tyres late in the race. Senna had a tardy stop, and he lost nearly all his advantage over Schumacher, who put in a string of fastest laps to close the gap. This challenge was ended when Schumacher went off the track at the final corner, after having to go off line to pass the smoking Lotus of Alessandro Zanardi. Prost won from Senna, Schumacher, Patrese, Andretti and Berger.

<text>The 1993 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the 51e Grand Prix de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 23 May 1993. It was the sixth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 78-lap race was won by Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna, driving a McLaren-Ford. It was Senna&#x27;s fifth consecutive Monaco win and sixth in all, breaking the record set by British driver Graham Hill in 1969. Hill&#x27;s son Damon finished second in a Williams-Renault, with Frenchman Jean Alesi third in a Ferrari. Senna also equalled the all-time record for wins at a single F1 Grand Prix. This race would be the last time Senna would win in Monaco as well as the last time he would lead the World Drivers&#x27; Championship standings.

==Summary==
Prost took pole ahead of Schumacher, Senna, Hill, Alesi and Patrese. Prost jumped the start with Berger getting ahead of Patrese. The order was: Prost, Schumacher, Senna, Hill, Alesi and Berger. 

At St. Devote on the first lap as ever there was a scrap as Blundell&#x27;s Ligier was forced wide off the track and eventually retired after spinning into the wall with suspension damage. Then Prost was penalised for the jump start with a stop-go penalty. He went on lap 12 but stalled the car as he was trying to exit. Finally the problem was fixed but he was a lap down and in 22nd. Wendlinger in the Sauber made contact with JJ Lehto and eventually Lehto retired in the pits by lap 24 with collision damage. Schumacher, now leading, pulled away as Alesi waved through teammate Berger. Schumacher, comfortably ahead, suddenly slowed down with a hydraulic problem on lap 33 and retired in a cloud of smoke at Loews. The main entertainment was provided by Prost as he climbed up the field despite difficult overtaking at the Monaco street circuit. 

It was time for the stops with no changes in the top 6 but Prost was the big gainer as he climbed from 10th to 7th. This became 6th and into the points when Patrese&#x27;s engine failed on lap 54. Prost passed Fittipaldi for fifth soon after. Herbert crashed out on the main straight with gearbox problems on lap 62 which he subsequently had for 20 laps. On lap 71, Berger attacked Hill and there was contact. Hill rejoined but Berger was out immediately. Senna won from Hill, Alesi, Prost, Fittipaldi and Brundle.

==Report==

===Qualifying===
There was a two by two formation in qualifying in Canada as the Williams were ahead of the Benettons and the Ferraris. Prost took pole ahead of Hill, Schumacher, Patrese, Berger and Alesi. Uncharacteristically, Senna was down in 8th.

===Race===
At the start, Hill beat Prost away, while the Benettons were slow and were passed by Berger and Senna (who had already got ahead of Brundle and then Alesi). Hill was leading Prost, Berger, Senna, Schumacher and Patrese.

Senna passed Berger for third on lap 2. On lap 6, Prost took the lead from Hill. Soon afterwards, Schumacher passed Berger with Patrese following him through five laps later. The order stabilised at: Prost, Hill, Senna, Schumacher, Patrese and Berger.

<doc id="1123168" wikidata="Q6344407" url="?curid=1123168" title="Kabuki (David W. Mack comic)">
<text>Kabuki is a comic book series created by artist and writer David Mack, first published in 1994 by Caliber Comics in &quot;KABUKI: Fear the Reaper&quot;, a 48-page comic book (with an eight page promotional peek at the story in &quot;High Caliber&quot; earlier that year). It is a story of an assassin who struggles with her identity in near-future Japan. The 2004–2009 miniseries, &quot;Kabuki: The Alchemy&quot;, was published by Marvel Comics under its imprint Icon Comics. The series has been collected into several trade paperbacks, which include several one-shots and spin-off limited series.

==Plot==
Set in an alternate near-future Japan, a young woman codenamed &quot;Kabuki&quot;, acts as an agent and television law-enforcement personality for a clandestine government body known as &quot;The Noh&quot;. In the first volume of the series, The Noh&#x27;s nature and background is explained.

The Noh is controlled by a renowned World War II Japanese military man known as the General, who has achieved much power and status for being a brilliant military tactician during his many years of service. The agency itself exists as part of Japan&#x27;s strict police state, which hunts down and brutally executes criminals for their misdeeds under the veil of keeping the peace. Secretly the Noh also acts to maintain the balance of crime and order that ultimately benefits the national economy on both sides of the law and thus targets politicians, businessmen and certain underworld kingpins whose actions threaten this balance. Kabuki herself is one of eight masked assassins who perform these secret executions under the General&#x27;s orders.

Ryuchi Kai is the General&#x27;s son and another war veteran, who is a Yakuza boss and every bit as deadly and brilliant as his father but has earned a reputation for swift brutality. Astonishingly, despite the high level of discretion surrounding Noh, Kai manages to infiltrate the agency, personally, by using its policy of masked operatives to his advantage. He poses as Oni – one of the General&#x27;s two overseers of the assassins (the other being a mysterious old man named &quot;Dove&quot;). He manipulates Kabuki and her partners into eliminating the entire underworld hierarchy in Tokyo. Publicly Kai is a talented businessman with much stock and influence in the Japanese market, thus this move makes him indispensable and essential to the balance.

Kabuki&#x27;s origins are revealed as the story progresses, her mother was an Ainu comfort woman named &quot;Tsukiko&quot; taken by Japanese soldiers during WWII. Rather than be used as sex slaves, the General instead had the women act out Kabuki plays to entertain the soldiers, something that was met with scorn by his son, who fast made &quot;Kabuki&quot; a derogatory term among the ranks. Tsukiko in particular captivated the General, a widower, who took her to be his wife. This decision infuriated Kai, who saw it as an affront to his deceased mother. On the eve of their wedding, he assaulted, raped, blinded and savagely scarred Tsukiko with the words &quot;Kabuki&quot; into her back. Tsukiko survived the encounter, and she was pregnant with Kai&#x27;s child, something the General kept hidden. Tsukiko dies while her daughter Ukiko is being born. The General in turn raises her as his own daughter. Nine years later, Kai, still demented and vicious, learns of the child&#x27;s existence and savagely attacks Ukiko at her mother&#x27;s grave, once again carving &quot;Kabuki&quot; into her skin, this time along the girl&#x27;s face. Ukiko dies for nine minutes but is successfully resuscitated. From then on, the General grooms her into a perfect soldier, having her trained in martial arts, combat and weaponry so that she may never fall victim to another assault. When the Noh is created, she is given a mask reminiscent of her mother&#x27;s face and the codename &quot;Kabuki&quot; – claiming the term as her own.

In the present, Kai is a political figurehead and inaccessible from The Noh&#x27;s wrath, going as far to reconnect with his father to cement his status. Most Noh agents are all dismissed by Dove except Kabuki. Dove reveals that he is in fact her biological grandfather on her mother&#x27;s side, that The Noh has become defunct, and that Kai&#x27;s reign has gone on long enough. He dispatches Kabuki/Ukiko to eliminate him, his followers, and The Noh&#x27;s board of directors. The battle is bloody, and Kai very nearly defeats her, though she succeeds at the last moment. Her final confrontation at the General&#x27;s headquarters results in her sustaining fatal wounds. Victorious and dying, Ukiko finally limps to her mother&#x27;s grave to die.

With the following volumes, it is revealed that Ukiko was in fact abducted shortly after this, by a rival agency called &quot;Control Corps&quot;, who treat her injuries and keep her trapped and medicated within a hidden asylum for broken-down government agents. For nine months, they study her and probe her for information regarding The Noh. She does not relent and instead, devotes this period to introspection and personal reflection. During this time she is contacted periodically by another inmate – a mysterious individual known as Akemi who has grand plans for escape. Meanwhile, outside of the asylum, all of Japan is in confusion as its top political lynchpins have been killed, and The Noh is unable to comment. Dove has vanished and, with him, all knowledge of Ukiko&#x27;s motives. Thus, the seven remaining assassins have been dispatched to hunt down Ukiko and kill her. Ironically during the months of searching, two of the agents, codenamed &quot;Scarab&quot; and &quot;Tigerlilly&quot;, become friends and start socializing as civilians – something which later compromises their mission.

Through Akemi&#x27;s elaborate machinations, Ukiko manages to escape Control Corps just as her former partners arrive to eliminate her, resulting in the death of one of them. Akemi takes advantage of this and just as Kai did, he poses as the fallen agent to continue infiltrating The Noh, this time on Ukiko&#x27;s behalf.

Ukiko then embarks on a convoluted trail, given to her by Akemi, so she can forge a new identity and life for herself. Escaping Japan to America, with the help of other brilliant escapees under Akemi&#x27;s employ, she successfully achieves a blissful, private existence wherein she can be happy. The final pages of the series see her subtly overthrowing The Noh altogether, through a tell-all comic book created by herself and a comic artist whom she encounters. She also falls pregnant, much to her delight.

==Style==
Unlike most comic series, the plot of &quot;Kabuki&quot; moves very little over the course of the volumes. Very little fast-paced or violent action takes place. Instead, most of the focus is on memories, dreams, thoughts and philosophy. David Mack&#x27;s characters, especially Kabuki herself, revisit the same scenes and memories many times, rethinking them and their significance. Mack uses myriad art styles, not only pencil, ink, and color, but paint, magazine clippings, manga scans, and crayons. In &quot;Kabuki: The Alchemy&quot; especially, many of the pages are photos (or color scans) of collages using a variety of materials; for example, the fingers of Japanese sandalwood fans become the borders of the comic panels. Imagery is very important and prominent in the series; Mack reuses the same images, often changing them slightly, and focusing on the emotional content of images and the power of memories.

In &quot;Kabuki: Masks of the Noh&quot;, a different artist was assigned to each agent as a way of visually representing their personalities. This continued in &quot;Kabuki: Scarab&quot;, which was written by Mack with art by Rick Mays, who had previously drawn Scarab in &quot;Masks of the Noh&quot;.

==Characters==
===The Noh Assassins===
* Kabuki/Ukiko - the protagonist of the series, Ukiko is a beautiful but tragic young woman struggling with her sense of self, following years of social withdrawal, mental conditioning and a severe assault during childhood that horribly disfigured her face. Ukiko acts as the top enforcement agent of The Noh, executing potentially dangerous individuals before they become national-level threats. She is also the voice of the airwaves and a national icon, updating the people of Japan with daily news and weather reports. When her biological father, Ryuchi Kai, begins to compromise the Noh, Ukiko sets out to eliminate him. She starts a difficult sequence of events that ultimately allows her to assess and actualize her own identity. Ukiko&#x27;s Kabuki-Noh costume is a variation of the Japanese flag, her weapons are Ainu farming sickles, and her mask is based on her mother&#x27;s face.
* Scarab/Keiko - considered the secondary character of the series, the codename &quot;Scarab&quot; was given to her because it is her duty to clean up the scenes left by the other Noh assassins, very much like the scarab beetle. Initially a street orphan alongside close friend Seiko, she encountered a young motorcycle hooligan named Yukio and quickly fell for him. Yukio&#x27;s involvement with the Yakuza results in him and her friend Seiko being killed. Keiko was granted amnesty for her part by a government agent named Kenji in exchange for the infiltration of various underworld social groups. Alongside this she was also given combat and weaponry training, ultimately leading to her placement as a Noh assassin. Following Kabuki&#x27;s betrayal, she and fellow agent Tigerlilly inadvertently form a deep friendship whilst in pursuit. Her Noh costume is a spiked, dominatrix-like bodysuit based on one of Yukio&#x27;s drawings, and her mask bears a swirling insect-like pattern.
* Tigerlilly - she is a fellow Noh assassin who befriends Scarab after being rescued by her, following a confrontation with Control Corps during their abduction of Kabuki. Very little is known about her early life, although she treasures her sister-like bond with Scarab, and often confides in her despite The Noh&#x27;s strict no-fraternization policy. Before her life as a Noh operative, she was a comic book artist which was a profession she maintained as a cover-role while working as an assassin. When the agents invade the Control Corps installation, Tiger Lily vanishes, presumably to target Kabuki; it is assumed she survived the incident based on Akemi&#x27;s letters in &quot;Kabuki Volume 6: The Alchemy&quot;. Also in this volume, Ukiko briefly encounters a woman comic artist on her airplane to America, with a very high suggestion that this may have been Tigerlilly&#x27;s civilian persona. Her Noh costume was initially a very revealing set of lingerie, with her hair tied back in a French plait. On Scarab&#x27;s advice, she switches to a more practical T-shirt and combat trousers. Her mask bears the stripes of her name, and she wields a short sword.
* Siamese - a pair of twin assassins who always work together as one Noh agent unit, they are often sent on missions that require their unique synchronicity. Born conjoined at the arm, they each have a prosthetic replacement, other than this very little is known of their background. One sister (the left twin) is quite talkative and taunts her targets, whereas the other is more taciturn and chooses to talk only when situations require. &quot;Kabuki Volume 4: Skin Deep&quot; sees Siamese standing over Ukiko&#x27;s corpse, presumably having killed her. With the entirety of the next two volumes acting as a flashback, Siamese take on a darkly, sinister tone, appearing briefly, but always after an act of brutal violence – the build-up to their confrontation is slow and full of dread. Ironically the quiet right twin of the two is revealed to be a fan of Kabuki&#x27;s on-screen persona and despairs over their mission. Siamese&#x27;s Noh costumes are sleeveless T-shirts bearing the Japanese sun and rotations of stockings and trousers. The prosthetic arms act as weapons by being fitted with various attachments, and their masks are halved and monochromatic.
* Ice - nothing is revealed about this particular agent&#x27;s identity or backstory. Ice&#x27;s personality makes her prominent. She is the most dedicated of the Noh assassins, never questioning orders and correcting those who do so. In the wake of Kai&#x27;s death, Ice takes the initiative and becomes the &quot;de facto&quot; field leader, directing the other agents to locate and eliminate Kabuki. Of all the agents, Ice&#x27;s costume is the most inconsistent. Initially she has thin, wiry hair, a transparent bra, and armoured combat trousers, but on occasion, she sports razor-tipped cornrows and no chest cover at all. Ice&#x27;s weapon set makes her one of the most formidable of the agents. Her arms are surgically adapted to contain sub-zero ice picks which she fires as weapons, and hence her name. Alongside this, her fingers are also diamond-tipped claws containing poison-tipped shurikens. Her Noh mask is relatively simple, with a curled spiral between the eyes.
* Snapdragon - the most mysterious of all the agents, Snapdragon is depicted as being a quiet, observing individual, much like Kabuki although much more savage. There is a strong indication that Snapdragon is also just as dissociative but with a greater flair for ambush and violence. Snapdragon&#x27;s costume includes gauntlets bearing the Japanese sun, a scant pair of black leather trousers and nipple tape, with occasional additions of netting and a matching jacket. The weaponry she wields includes a kusarigama chain-and-blade weapon. Snapdragon&#x27;s mask bears a black band around the eyes like a blindfold, with a similar, thinner band from the mouth.
* Butoh - the final Noh assassin, her codename literally translates as &quot;Dancer&quot;, an apt name, considering the nature of her costume and weapons: a white ballet leotard and tights with razor-edged folding fans. Little is revealed about Butoh&#x27;s past or even her present, though &quot;Volume 3: Masks of The Noh&quot; sheds a brief light on her thought process. She is very methodical, or even mechanical, in her training and activities for The Noh. She states that even she is not what she appears – something which is never expanded upon. Her mask is a simple smiling face with rosy cheeks.

All Noh assassins bear a dragon tattoo on the back. The dragon wings spread to cover both shoulders, while the tail reaches to the lower back area. A bulletproof kabuki mask covers the face, to conceal the identity. The mask is made of the ceramic lightweight material that used for Japanese bullet trains, and is stronger than metal. Boots and utility belts are included. The eyes of the mask are connected to a red visor, which allows the assassin to share their vision with the Noh via camera-link, all while processing data. The general color and clothing is black leather and silk, which makes it easy for an assassin to avoid detection while moving about in shadows and darkness. The silk is mostly used to cover the arms to conceal arm movements. The body armor worn is bulletproof. All assassins have individual designs to suit them. For example, spikes are worn as part of Scarab&#x27;s assassin garb, because her armor design is based on a sketch that Yukio drew in his spare time. Scarab&#x27;s appearance may be considered the most fancy look among the eight assassins. The Noh assassins are highly skilled with Neo Warsaw Pact and NATO firearms, Okinawan black market weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and attack and defense using the environment. The preferred weapons of choice are usually handguns, and various bladed weapons. The long fingernails are sometimes dipped in poisoned nail polish. Each assassin has her own favorite weapons that she normally prefers to carry out her missions.

===The Kai Syndicate===
* Ryuichi Kai is a politician who is also leader of the Kai Syndicate. He is the real father of Kabuki, from the time he raped and mutilated her mother. Upon learning of Ukiko&#x27;s existence, he soon finds her and viciously scars her face with the word &quot;kabuki&quot;, just as he did with her mother. An avid reader, he enjoys readings on philosophers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche in his spare time.
* Cowboy is a photogenic criminal.
* Johnny Yamamoto
* Violet
* Link Kinoshita

===Other characters===
* Seiko Saito was Keiko&#x27;s childhood friend who was also murdered by Yamamoto Gumi. She and Keiko first met at an orphanage. As a rebel, she has spent time going through different foster families, due to the indifference that she had towards groups, institutions, organizations, gangs, politics of organized religion, and rules in general. A practitioner of body modification, she has had her ears, eyebrows, and navel pierced. For this, she was often nicknamed &quot;Voodoo Doll&quot;, as well as &quot;Psycho-Seiko&quot;, due to her very short temper, and love of recklessness and confrontation. She believed in God and Christianity, and possessed good knowledge and understanding of the Holy Bible.
* Tsukiko is the mother of Ukiko, who died while giving birth to her. A woman of Ainu descent, she was the lover of Ukiko&#x27;s grandfather, but was raped and scarred by Kai out of resentment on the evening before her wedding. When the general found Tsukiko, her eyes were gone and the word &quot;kabuki&quot; had been carved into her back. Her name means &quot;tsuki no musume (つきのむすめ)&quot; or &quot;daughter of the moon&quot;. Ukiko often sees her in her dreams, and as able to describe her countenance.
* Yukio is the deceased lover of Scarab, who was murdered by Yamamoto Gumi. Not much else is known about him, although he enjoyed sketching, collecting and creating figurines, and tinkering with his bike. He possibly was a writer, who enjoyed poetry, as well as pithy sayings.
* Yamamoto Gumi is a group of Yakuza that Yukio once worked and ran errands for.
* M.C. Square is another inmate at Control Corps. Lively and highly intelligent, she has an obsession with numbers, math, and arithmetic.
* Akemi is a veterinarian/artist who works at the Little Friend Animal Clinic. A former Noh agent, the original Tigerlilly, she is Kabuki&#x27;s fellow inmate at Control Corps, and helps her to survive and escape the institution. It is suggested to the reader that either she and Ukiko are closer than friends, or is perhaps she is an alter-ego of Ukiko herself. Her name is a semi-homophonic similarity to the word &quot;Alchemy&quot;.
* Kenji is a mysterious young man, who has connections to the Noh, as well as law. Not much is known about him, although he was responsible for the recruiting of Keiko.
* General Kai is the father of Ryuchi, as well as Ukiko&#x27;s grandfather. He was the husband of Tsukiko, but tragically is the grandfather of Ukiko, given the shameful truth that it was his own son who raped and scarred Tsukiko.

== Film ==
David Mack has been working on a live-action &quot;Kabuki&quot; feature film for 20th Century Fox. Besides writing the treatment, his credits include: Visual Designer, Creative Consultant and Co-Producer. The release date is unknown.

==Toys==
In the late 1990s, Moore Action Collectibles released several action figures and variants based on the character Kabuki; further releases were planned, but never came about. In 2004, Scarab received an action figure and variants from Diamond Select Toys. In 2005, a Kabuki Minimate was released in the Indie Comics Boxset along with Magdalena, Dawn and Witchblade. In 2009, Shocker Toys released a Kabuki figure as part of the first series of its &quot;Indie Spotlight&quot; line.

Figures of Kabuki, Tigerlily, Scarab and Siamese were released for the Heroclix collectable figure game by Wizkids / NECA. This was as part of the Indyclix expansion to the game. There were 3 versions each of Kabuki, Tigerlily, and Scarab, and only 1 of Siamese, which was a &quot;Unique&quot; figure and much rarer. Due to the sculptor using a particular comic panel for his image of Tigerlily, she was designed wealding twin Uzzi machine pistols rather than her usual blades, resulting in confusion among players and fans, as all 3 of her game pieces had no &quot;range&quot; value.

==Reception==

Kabuki took part in IGN&#x27;s Battle of the Comic-Book Babes contest in 2005, losing against Mystique.

<text>The 1993 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Magny-Cours on 4 July 1993. It was the eighth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 72-lap race was won by home favourite Alain Prost, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from second position. Prost&#x27;s British teammate Damon Hill finished second, having started from pole position and led the first 26 laps, with German Michael Schumacher third in a Benetton-Ford. With Prost&#x27;s Brazilian rival Ayrton Senna finishing fourth in his McLaren-Ford, Prost extended his lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 12 points.

The race marked Prost&#x27;s 100th Formula One podium, making him the first driver to achieve the milestone. It was also the last Grand Prix for Fabrizio Barbazza.

This was the first race to feature BBC commentary from Jonathan Palmer, replacing James Hunt after his death following the Canadian Grand Prix. Palmer would partner Murray Walker until the conclusion of the 1996 season when the television rights went to ITV for 1997.

==Qualifying report==
With local hero Alain Prost taking pole position in all of the previous seven races, there was a massive turnout for qualifying where the Williams were usually dominant. The Williams did take 1-2 in qualifying, but it was Damon Hill who took his first Formula One pole, 0.142 seconds ahead of Prost. The Ligier team, in its home race, filled the second row with Martin Brundle ahead of Mark Blundell, and thus completed a 1-2-3-4 for Renault-powered cars. Ayrton Senna in the McLaren and Jean Alesi in the Ferrari were on the third row, Michael Schumacher in the Benetton and Rubens Barrichello in the Jordan made up the fourth, and the Larrousse team, also contesting its home race, took up the fifth with Érik Comas ahead of Philippe Alliot. For the fourth time in five races, Michele Alboreto came last in his Lola and thus failed to qualify.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
At the start, the top five stayed the same while Schumacher got ahead of Alesi. Hill led from Prost, Brundle, Blundell, Senna and Schumacher.

The Williams pulled away while Brundle pulled away from Blundell who was holding up Senna and Schumacher. However, this ended when Blundell was pushed off the road and into retirement on lap 21 as he attempted to lap de Cesaris. It was time for the mid-race stops during which Prost got ahead of Hill and Senna and Schumacher closed up on Brundle.

During the second stops, Prost stayed ahead - just by two-tenths while Senna and Schumacher got ahead of Brundle. Schumacher passed Senna when the two were going through traffic and pulled away. Prost won with Hill right behind to make it a Williams 1-2 ahead of Schumacher, Senna, Brundle and Andretti.

Thus, at the halfway stage of the season, Prost led the World Championship with 57 points. Senna was a further 12 points behind in second with 45, Hill was third with 28, Schumacher was fourth with 24, Brundle fifth with 9, Blundell sixth with 6, Herbert seventh with 6 and Lehto eighth with 5. There were no real battles in the Constructors Championship with Williams comfortably leading with 85 points with McLaren 37 points behind in second with 48. Benetton were third with 29 and Ligier were fourth with 15.

By winning the race, Prost became the first Formula One driver to reach 100 career podiums.

<text>The 1993 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 11 July 1993. It was the ninth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 59-lap race was won from pole position by Alain Prost, driving a Williams-Renault. It was Prost&#x27;s sixth victory of the season and the 50th of his Formula One career. Michael Schumacher finished second in a Benetton-Ford, with teammate Riccardo Patrese third.

This was the second race of 1993 to be held in Britain, after the European Grand Prix at Donington Park three months earlier. The next time Britain would host two races in a single season would be in , when Silverstone hosted both the British Grand Prix and the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix.

==Report==
With Nigel Mansell now racing Indycars in America, British racing fans had taken Damon Hill to their hearts. Williams took 1–2 in qualifying with Prost on pole ahead of Hill, Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, Patrese and Martin Brundle.

At the start, Hill took the lead from Prost, who was also passed by Senna. Michael Andretti in the other McLaren spun off at Copse on the first lap, while Hill pulled away at the front, and Senna held up both Prost and Schumacher. Prost finally passed Senna on lap 7 but Hill was already five seconds up the road. On lap 13, Schumacher passed Senna for third and pulled away as the order settled down.
Gradually Prost closed up on Hill, narrowing the gap to three seconds after the mid-race pit stops. Then, Luca Badoer crashed, bringing out the Safety Car and reducing the gap between Hill and Prost to nothing. The Safety Car came in on lap 40, before Hill&#x27;s engine blew two laps later. Brundle&#x27;s gearbox failed on lap 54 when he was fourth. Finally, on the last lap, Senna&#x27;s car ran out of fuel. Prost took his 50th Grand Prix win ahead of Schumacher, Patrese, Johnny Herbert, Senna (who was classified fifth) and Derek Warwick.

Complimenting the Lotus team on Herbert&#x27;s fourth-place finish, Murray Walker closed his broadcast with the words &quot;Lotus are back!&quot;. As it turned out, the team only scored points once more, before closing its doors at the end of the following year.

<text>The 1993 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Hockenheim on 25 July 1993. It was the tenth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 45-lap race was won by Frenchman Alain Prost, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from pole position. Prost&#x27;s British teammate Damon Hill led for most of the race, only to be denied his first F1 win by a tyre failure on the penultimate lap. Prost duly took his seventh win of the season, and his 51st and final Grand Prix victory overall, with local driver Michael Schumacher second in a Benetton-Ford and another Briton, Mark Blundell, third in a Ligier-Renault.

==Report==

The two Williams were 1st and 2nd in qualifying with Prost on pole ahead of Hill, Schumacher, Senna, Blundell and Brundle. Prost had a poor start and was passed by Hill, Schumacher and Senna. Prost reclaimed third from Senna on the run down to the first chicane, which they entered side by side. Exiting the chicane, Senna spun and had to wait for the entire field to pass by before he could rejoin. Fourth placed Brundle then spun as well at the second chicane forcing Prost to take evasive action and bypass part of the track. Both would serve 10-second stop-and-go penalties for this later in the race. At the end of the first lap, Hill led Schumacher, Prost, Blundell, Patrese, Berger and Alesi.

Prost was on a charge, passing Schumacher on lap 6. He closed up on Hill three laps later. Behind, on the next lap, Berger tried to pass Suzuki and they collided, with Suzuki spinning off. Yellow flags were waved and Hill slowed down a little on the next lap. Prost took his chance and passed Hill to lead. He then served his controversial stop-go penalty (which he called a scandal in the press conference later that day) on the next lap and dropped to sixth behind Patrese. 

Schumacher was the first of the leaders to pit for tyres, resuming in fourth place, behind Prost and Blundell and just in front of teammate Patrese. He then passed Blundell for third in the first chicane on the next lap, Brundle having dropped back to midfield due to serving his stop-go penalty on lap 12. Senna had worked his way up to seventh but was unable to pass Berger&#x27;s Ferrari, eventually choosing to pit for tyres, as did first Patrese and Blundell, leaving the order midway through the race: Hill, Prost, Schumacher, Berger, Blundell, Patrese and Senna, neither Williams choosing to come in for tyres in this race. Blundell on new tyres was able to pass Berger for fourth only for the Austrian to repass him on the next straight with some fierce slipstreaming. Blundell eventually passed Berger for good coming into the stadium section, with Patrese and Senna both closing rapidly on the Austrian. Senna gained fifth place, passing both Patrese and Berger on the following lap, with Patrese also able to slipstream past the Ferrari, which was suffering increasingly on its aging tyres. Schumacher then stopped for a third set of tyres dropping him further behind the two Williams cars while still half a minute clear of Blundell in fourth position, who preserved a slight gap to Senna&#x27;s McLaren in fifth.

In the closing laps Prost closed on Hill, while Schumacher set a string of fastest lap times to close to within 17s of Prost. Senna - still unable to pass Blundell - came in for an unscheduled tyre stop on lap 41, rejoining safely in front of Patrese. Hill&#x27;s lead was reduced to 8 seconds by the penultimate lap but appeared to be cruising to victory until, coming out of the Ostkurve, his left rear tyre deflated, Hill having to retire his car before reaching the pits. Instead of Hill taking his first victory, Prost took what was to be his final and 51st win in front of a typically delighted Schumacher followed by Blundell, Senna, Patrese and Berger.

<text>The 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Hungaroring on 15 August 1993. It was the eleventh race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 77-lap race was won by Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. After retiring from the lead in the previous two races, Hill finally took his first Formula One victory, becoming the first son of a World Champion to win a race himself. Riccardo Patrese finished second in a Benetton-Ford, achieving his final podium finish, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Another F1 veteran, Derek Warwick, scored his final points by finishing fourth in a Footwork-Mugen-Honda.

Hill&#x27;s teammate and Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Alain Prost, took pole position, but stalled on the warm-up lap and had to start from the back of the grid. He subsequently lost several laps due to a faulty rear wing - giving an interview for French television while the Williams team worked on his car.

==Report==

===Qualifying===
The two Williamses were 1-2 in qualifying in Hungary, with Prost on pole ahead of Hill, Schumacher, Senna, Patrese and Berger.

===Race===
Prost stalled on the parade lap, and had to start at the back. At the start, Schumacher got pushed down by Senna, Berger (who was already ahead of Patrese) and Patrese. Hill was leading Senna, Berger, Patrese, Schumacher and Alesi. 

Schumacher tried to pass Berger on lap 4 but spun and dropped back to 10th. Both McLarens had throttle problems, Andretti slowing down in front of Schumacher on lap 16 and making Schumacher spin again, dropping down to 14th, right behind the recovering Prost. Senna also retired on lap 18 with throttle problems marking the first time since the race was introduced in 1986 that he failed to finish either 1st or 2nd, as everyone pitted except the Williamses and Schumacher. This left Hill ahead of Patrese, Prost, Schumacher, Berger and Alesi. 

Then, Prost had to go into the pits because of problems with his rear wing. He rejoined seven laps behind. On lap 23, Alesi spun off as he hit the armco barrier and retired as a result of backmarkers just in front of the French Sicilian, meanwhile Patrese waved through Schumacher who took second. However, he retired three laps later with fuel pump problems. Berger pitted from third and rejoined in fifth but he quickly passed Brundle and then Warwick to get back third. Pierluigi Martini looked sure for scoring his first point since San Marino the previous year before the Minardi driver would later crash out of 6th position with only 18 laps to go. Hill took his first ever win ahead of Patrese, Berger, Warwick, Brundle and Wendlinger. It would also be the last race that former Williams driver Thierry Boutsen would finish, as the Belgian veteran retired from Formula 1 at the very next race after 10 years in the sport.

<text>The legal term Corpus Juris means &quot;body of law&quot;.

It was originally used by the Romans for several of their collections of all the laws in a certain field—see &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;—and was later adopted by medieval jurists in assembling the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;.

Later the term was used for comprehensive collections of laws in the US, as in &quot;Corpus Juris Secundum&quot;. The term is commonly used to refer to the entire body of law of a country, jurisdiction, or court, such as &quot;the &quot;corpus juris&quot; of the Supreme Court of the United States.&quot;

The phrase has been used in the European Union to describe the possibility of a &quot;European Legal Area&quot;, a &quot;European Public Prosecutor&quot; and a &quot;European Criminal Code&quot;. Eurosceptics in the United Kingdom attacked the plans, which they saw as a threat to the criminal law traditions of some member states, such as jury trials by independent juries, habeas corpus, and prohibitions against double jeopardy.

<text>The 1993 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 29 August 1993. It was the twelfth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 44-lap race was won by Briton Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. Hill&#x27;s French teammate, Alain Prost, took pole position and led the first 30 laps, before he suffered a slow pit stop and dropped to third behind Hill and German Michael Schumacher in the Benetton-Ford. Hill went on to win by 3.6 seconds from Schumacher with Prost a further 11 seconds back; the 1–3 finish secured Williams their second consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Lotus driver Alessandro Zanardi was withdrawn from the meeting following a huge crash in Friday practice, which ultimately ended his season. In the race itself, his team-mate Johnny Herbert scored the final points ever for Team Lotus with his 5th position. Local driver Thierry Boutsen retired from Formula One following the race (after his race ended on the first lap with a gearbox failure).

==Qualifying report==
Once again, Alain Prost took pole position in his Williams-Renault with teammate Damon Hill alongside him on the front row of the grid, the two separated on this occasion by nearly nine-tenths of a second. On the second row were Michael Schumacher in the Benetton and Jean Alesi in the Ferrari, and on the third row were Ayrton Senna in the McLaren and Aguri Suzuki in the Footwork. Completing the top ten were Derek Warwick in the second Footwork, Riccardo Patrese in the second Benetton, JJ Lehto in the Sauber and Johnny Herbert in the Lotus.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
At the start, Senna got ahead of both Schumacher and Alesi with Alesi also getting by Schumacher. The order at the end of lap 1 was: Prost, Senna, Hill, Alesi, Schumacher and Suzuki.

Alesi retired then with suspension troubles on lap 4, releasing Schumacher. Schumacher then set off after Senna and overtook him on the grass during the first round of pitstops. The first stops did not change anything, with Prost leading from Hill, Schumacher and Senna. Suzuki was a distant fifth until his gearbox failed on lap 15. Prost had a slow second stop, which allowed Hill to take the lead. Schumacher then overtook Prost to claim second. Prost smashed the lap record on lap 41 in his chase of Schumacher, but he found out that he was just a tenth quicker and settled for third. Hill won, wrapping up the Constructors Championship for Williams with Schumacher and Prost close behind. Senna was a lonely fourth, while Herbert and Patrese, who spun after his pitstop, took the final points. Herbert&#x27;s 2 points for 5th place would turn out to be the last points finish for a Team Lotus driver.

Thus, with three-quarters of the season gone, Prost was a full 28 points ahead and could sense the championship, having 81 points to Senna&#x27;s 53. Hill was third with 48, Schumacher was fourth with 42, Patrese was fifth with 18, Brundle was sixth with 11, Herbert was seventh with 11 and Blundell was eighth with 10. In the Constructors Championship, Williams were World Champions with 129 points ahead of Benetton who were second with 60, McLaren close behind in third with 56 and Ligier fourth with 21 – their best performance in some years.

<text>Reefton is a small town in the West Coast region of New Zealand, approximately northeast of Greymouth, in the Inangahua River valley. Ahaura is south-west of Reefton, Inangahua Junction is to the north, Maruia is to the east, and the Lewis Pass is to the south-east.

In 1888, it was the first town in New Zealand to be lit by electricity, generated by the Reefton Power Station. Reefton was a thriving gold mining town in the late 19th century, and gold mining lasted from the 1870s to the 1950s. Its economy is based on tourism, forestry, coal mining, and farming.

Reefton is home to the Inangahua County Library.

==Name==
The rich veins of gold found in a quartz reef near the town led to its name, originally spelled &quot;Reef Town&quot;. Two nicknames in use soon after it was founded were &quot;Rest Town&quot; and &quot;Quartzopolis&quot;. The main street, Broadway, was named after West Coast magistrate Charles Broad. The nearby Wealth of Nations mine was named after Adam Smith&#x27;s book because the gold been discovered by another Adam Smith (no relation).

== History ==
* 1866 – Alluvial gold discovered in the Īnangahua Valley
* 1870 – Quartz reefs discovered at Reefton
* 1872 – Reefton Hospital opened
* 1886 – Reefton School of Mines opened
* 1888 – Town electricity supply commenced
* 1892 – Railway line opened
* 1908 – Rail line to Cronadun opened
* 1912 – Mine workers locked out
* 1967 – Rail passenger services ceased

=== Gold mining ===

Alluvial gold was first discovered near the town in 1866; the major discovery of gold in quartz reefs was made in 1870 and gold was being extracted by 1872. Mining from quartz reefs only took place at Reefton and Lyell.

An earlier settlement, known as Ross Town, had been established on the opposite bank of the Inangahua River around 1870, but most businesses shifted across the river in 1871 to be nearer the quartz mining. There were mines at nearby locations such as Waiuta and Blacks Point.

There was a downturn in the industry in the 1880s due to lack of money to develop deeper mines. Consolidated Goldfields New Zealand formed in 1896 and ran several mines. Technology was modernised and the Reefton School of Mines opened in 1887 to apply more scientific knowledge to mining. Blackwater mine operated from 1908 until 1951, when a shaft collapsed. It reopened as Snowy River mine in December 2020 and employed 60 staff, who had dug of tunnels by 2024, with plans for further expansion. Globe Progress mine produced of gold as an opencast pit from 2007 to 2016.

=== Electricity ===
In 1888 Reefton became the first town in New Zealand to receive electricity, the work of Walter Prince, and its streets were lit by commercial electricity generated by the Reefton Power Station. The power station was demolished in 1961 but the Reefton Power House Charitable Trust Inc has raised $4.5 million for a restructure project, and work started on buildings and a water race in 2019.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Located in the Inangahua Valley at an altitude of 194m, Reefton falls under the Köppen-Geiger climate classification of Cfb (Oceanic), though the town&#x27;s sheltered inland location lends its climate less maritime influence than coastal areas; as such, Reefton has recorded both the extreme highest temperature of 33.7 °C (92.7 °F) and the extreme lowest temperature of -8.5 °C (16.7 °F) in the West Coast region. At an average temperature of 17.4 °C (63.3 °F), February is the warmest month. July is the coldest month, at 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). Reefton&#x27;s average annual temperature is 11.7 °C. Due to the town&#x27;s inland location, summer afternoons are often considerably warmer in Reefton than coastal locations such as Greymouth or Westport, and it is not uncommon for winter mornings to be several degrees colder; nightly inversions of temperature are common due to the local geography, which encourages frequent periods of calm air. An average of 24 days per year will exceed 25 °C (77 °F); during an average winter, Reefton can expect to see 46 days of air frost and 61 days of ground frost. The Reefton area is the driest in the West Coast; this is largely due to the rain-shadow effect of the Paparoa Range.

==Demographics==
Reefton covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Reefton had a population of 927 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 129 people (−12.2%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 54 people (−5.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 447 households, comprising 471 males and 456 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.03 males per female. The median age was 51.9 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 132 people (14.2%) aged under 15 years, 120 (12.9%) aged 15 to 29, 453 (48.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 222 (23.9%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 90.0% European/Pākehā, 13.3% Māori, 1.0% Pasifika, 2.9% Asian, and 2.6% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 11.3, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 53.1% had no religion, 32.0% were Christian, 0.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Muslim and 1.3% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 63 (7.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 246 (30.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $22,900, compared with $31,800 nationally. 78 people (9.8%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 306 (38.5%) people were employed full-time, 117 (14.7%) were part-time, and 24 (3.0%) were unemployed.

== Economy ==
Gold mining recommenced in 2007 when Oceana Gold opened a new mine. In 2013 it employed 260 people. The mine closed in 2016 and Oceana Gold has undertaken an environmental rehabilitation programme at the site.

A new gold mine is planned to open in 2024, it is expected to employ 100 people.

Other industries in the town are coal mining, forestry, tourism and servicing the farming industry.

==Transport==
Reefton is located at the intersection of State Highway 7 and State Highway 69.

=== Rail ===
Reefton is located on the Stillwater–Westport Line railway, which diverges from the Midland Line in Stillwater. On 29 February 1892, the line was opened to Reefton, but it terminated on the southern bank of the Inangahua River opposite the town. Early in the 20th century, a bridge was built across the river and the present-day station established in Reefton. The line was opened beyond Reefton to Cronadun in 1908, but it was not until 5 December 1943 that the line officially became a through route to Westport, though trains had been operating the length of the line since July 1942. On 3 August 1936, a railcar passenger service began operating in the morning between Hokitika and Reefton utilising small Leyland diesel railcars, but low patronage meant this service ceased to operate all the way to Reefton in August 1938. In the early 1940s, much larger Vulcan railcars were introduced to New Zealand and they provided two services to Reefton: one local service from Greymouth that terminated in Reefton, and a service that ran between Westport and Stillwater to connect with the West Coast Express. In 1967, all passenger services through Reefton ceased. Today, the primary traffic on the railway is coal, with multiple coal trains operating daily.

==Education==
The first state school in Reefton was founded in 1878, and there were once 24 schools in the area.

Reefton Area School is a composite (years 1–13) school with a roll of as of It was formed by the merger of Reefton School and Inangahua College (earlier called Reefton District High School) in 2004.

Sacred Heart School is a full primary (years 1–8) school with a roll of . It is a state integrated Catholic school. Both schools are coeducational.

==Broadcast and print media==
The first newspaper to be printed in Reefton was the &quot;Inangahua Herald and New Zealand Miner&quot;, which began as a twice-weekly paper in February 1872, its joint owner being Joseph Ivess, who went on to found many other newspapers. It was appearing three times a week by 1874 and became a daily in 1894. Its owner and editor from 1909 was Maud L. G. Beresford Wilkinson.

Its main rival, the &quot;Inangahua Times&quot;, was established by William Joseph Potts in 1875. Potts was editor of Ahaura&#x27;s &quot;Grey Valley Times&quot; in 1873, and in 1874 he started the short-lived &quot;Reefton Courier and Inangahua Advertiser&quot; which survived only to the end of the year, and was the predecessor of the &quot;Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; initially appeared three times a week, but by 1891 was a daily. Potts owned the &quot;Times&quot; until his death in 1901, and his wife Mary Potts was editor from 1897 to 1905.

For a short time Reefton, with a population of just 2000 and a circulation area of 4648, was home to three competing daily papers: the third, the &quot;Reefton Guardian,&quot; was first published in 1888, and was bought out by the &quot;Inangahua Times&quot; in 1894. All three papers were served for more than fifty years by the compositor, editor, and publisher James Noble, who started at the &quot;Guardian&quot; and eventually became editor and publisher of the &quot;Times&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot; succumbed to the Depression in 1936 and merged with the &quot;Times&quot; in 1936. After James Noble the &quot;Times&quot; was run by Ernest Nicholson until it ceased publication on 6 June 1942, a casualty of war shortages. It was revived in 1946 by Reefton&#x27;s Presbyterian minister Rev. C. R. (Bob) Sprackett as the &quot;Inangahua-Murchison Times&quot;, printed in Greymouth, which survived as a weekly until 1956.

Locally received radio stations include repeaters of both The Hits from Greymouth and Coast FM from Westport. The &quot;Greymouth Star&quot; newspaper is also received daily in the town.

<text>The 1993 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Pioneer 64º Gran Premio d&#x27;Italia) was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 12 September 1993. It was the thirteenth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by British driver Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from second position. Frenchman Jean Alesi finished second in a Ferrari, while American Michael Andretti finished third in a McLaren-Ford, in his final F1 race before returning to IndyCar. Hill&#x27;s teammate, Frenchman Alain Prost, took pole position and led until suffering an engine failure with five laps to go, allowing Hill to take his third consecutive victory.

==Report==
The Williams cars dominated qualifying, locking out the front row of the grid with Alain Prost on pole and Damon Hill alongside him. Jean Alesi took third in his Ferrari; he was joined on the second row by Ayrton Senna in the McLaren. Michael Schumacher in the Benetton and Gerhard Berger in the second Ferrari made up the third row. Further down the grid, Pedro Lamy was making his Grand Prix debut for the cash-strapped Lotus outfit, taking the place of the injured Alessandro Zanardi, while the Jordan team, needing a replacement for Thierry Boutsen following the Belgian&#x27;s retirement from F1, had decided to evaluate Japanese Formula 3000 driver Marco Apicella, after their test driver Emanuele Naspetti had turned down the opportunity to race.

At the start, Alesi got ahead of a sluggish Hill and Senna tried to do the same, but there was contact between Hill and Senna, resulting in both drivers dropping back, with Senna ending up in 9th and Hill in 10th. Further back, two separate incidents saw five cars eliminated at the first chicane. In the first incident, the Footworks of Derek Warwick and Aguri Suzuki collided and took each other out. In the second incident, Sauber driver JJ Lehto, who had to start from the back of the grid, took himself and the Jordans of Rubens Barrichello and Apicella out of the race. Apicella&#x27;s debut, which would also turn out to be his only Grand Prix start, had lasted no more than 800 metres, unofficially making him the driver with one of the shortest careers in Formula One. Prost led Alesi, Schumacher, Berger, Johnny Herbert and Martin Brundle into lap 2. On lap 4 Schumacher passed Alesi to take second position.

On lap 8, Senna collided with Brundle&#x27;s Ligier, putting them both out. Prost&#x27;s championship ambitions received a major boost with Senna&#x27;s retirement. Johnny Herbert spun off and hit the tyre barriers at Parabolica as he retired from 5th position since Berger pitted for tyres on lap 15, putting Berger back in 5th position but soon retired from 5th position with suspension problems 1 lap later. Hill in the meantime had moved up to fourth place and passed Alesi for third on lap 10, as Blundell in the remaining Ligier like Herbert had clipped the barrier at Parabolica and retired with a left-rear puncture and damaging his left-rear suspension on lap 21 whilst battling Wendlinger for 7th. Before Hill moved up to second on lap 22 when Schumacher&#x27;s engine failed. At this point, Prost led by nearly 20 seconds, but by lap 48 Hill had reduced this lead to two seconds. Then, on lap 49, five from the end, the Renault engine in Prost&#x27;s car blew. Hill took his third consecutive win by 40 seconds from Alesi, with Michael Andretti third (achieving his only podium) and Karl Wendlinger, Riccardo Patrese (scoring his final points in F1) and Érik Comas completing the top six.

The Minardis of Pierluigi Martini and Christian Fittipaldi had approached the chequered flag with Fittipaldi closely following Martini. Fittipaldi&#x27;s left front wheel made contact with his teammate&#x27;s right rear wheel, and the contact launched Fittipaldi&#x27;s car into the air. The car completed a back flip before landing back on its wheels and skidded across the line. Neither driver was hurt and both finished the race without losing a position.

This was the Williams team&#x27;s seventh consecutive victory. Prior to the race weekend, Andretti and McLaren mutually agreed to part ways and that this would be his final race with the team. He would be replaced by the team&#x27;s test driver, Mika Häkkinen. His final Formula One race returned his best result of the season with his third-place finish. By winning in Italy, Hill became the first Formula One driver to take their first three wins at consecutive Grands Prix, a feat only repeated by Mika Häkkinen, though only Hill won all three races in the same year.

As of 2024, Andretti&#x27;s podium finish remains the last for an American driver in Formula One.

<text>The 1993 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Estoril on 26 September 1993. It was the fourteenth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race was won by German driver Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Ford. Frenchman Alain Prost finished second in his Williams-Renault, a result which secured him his fourth Drivers&#x27; Championship. Prost&#x27;s British teammate Damon Hill finished third, having taken pole position before stalling on the dummy grid and having to start from the back.

The BMS Scuderia Italia team withdrew from the championship after this race.

==Background==

In between the Italian and Portuguese Grands Prix, Michael Andretti left Formula One to return to the United States, his McLaren seat being taken by Mika Häkkinen. On the Friday before the Portuguese race, Alain Prost announced his retirement from Formula One at the end of the season, with Ayrton Senna set to take his place at Williams alongside Damon Hill.

==Qualifying report==

Once again, the Williams-Renaults filled the front row of the grid, but on this occasion Hill took pole position from Prost by just under 0.2 seconds. Häkkinen was third in the McLaren, surprisingly ahead of teammate Senna by just under 0.05 seconds, with Jean Alesi fifth in the Ferrari and Michael Schumacher sixth in the Benetton. Riccardo Patrese was seventh in the second Benetton and Gerhard Berger eighth in the second Ferrari, with Derek Warwick in the Footwork and Mark Blundell in the Ligier completing the top ten.

===Qualifying classification===

==Race report==

Hill&#x27;s engine refused to fire on the parade lap and he had to start at the back. At the start, Prost got squeezed out by the McLarens and Alesi, with Alesi getting ahead of the McLarens with Senna ahead of Häkkinen. Alesi led Senna, Häkkinen, Prost, Schumacher and Berger.

The top six stayed together but the Williamses and Schumacher were on a one-stop strategy unlike the McLarens and Ferraris. On lap 20, Senna&#x27;s engine blew as Alesi, Häkkinen and Schumacher pitted, with Alesi losing out to both. This left Prost leading from Blundell, Hill, Häkkinen, Schumacher and Alesi. Schumacher passed Häkkinen on lap 25 and pulled away. Prost would stop on lap 29 but Schumacher would rejoin ahead. When Hill stopped as well, Schumacher was leading from Prost, Häkkinen, Hill, Alesi and Berger.

On lap 33, Häkkinen crashed into the wall at the last corner. Three laps later, Berger&#x27;s suspension failed dramatically at the exit of the pitlane, sending him across the start-finish straight, being nearly hit by a Footwork. Blundell crashed from sixth on lap 52 as Prost began to hassle Schumacher. However, second place was enough for Prost to win the championship, so the French driver did not take any risks. Patrese was fifth but he too crashed on lap 64 into the Footwork of Derek Warwick forcing both drivers to retire. Schumacher had a minor off but still just kept his lead. Schumacher won from new World Champion Prost, Hill, Alesi, Wendlinger and Brundle.

With only two more races to go, Prost was the World Champion with 87 points but there was battle for second between Hill, Senna and Schumacher. Hill was second with 62, Senna was third with 53 and Schumacher was fourth with 52. Behind, Patrese was fifth with 20, Alesi was sixth with 13, Brundle was seventh with 12 and Herbert was eighth with 11.

<text>The 1993 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the XIX Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Suzuka on 24 October 1993. It was the fifteenth race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by Ayrton Senna, driving a McLaren-Ford, after he started from second position. Alain Prost finished second in a Williams-Renault, having started from pole position, while Senna&#x27;s teammate Mika Häkkinen came third, achieving his first podium finish.

Jordan drivers Rubens Barrichello and Eddie Irvine (the latter making his F1 debut) scored their first points by finishing fifth and sixth respectively. Irvine was subsequently punched by Senna for unlapping himself during the race. Two other drivers made their F1 debuts at this race, Jean-Marc Gounon and Toshio Suzuki. Only 24 cars were entered, following the withdrawal of the BMS Scuderia Italia team from F1 in the run-up to the race.

==Report==
===Qualifying===
Prost took pole (the last of his career) ahead of Senna, Häkkinen, Schumacher, Berger and Hill.

===Race===
At the start, Senna got ahead of Prost while Berger took Schumacher. Eddie Irvine, the fifth occupant of the second Jordan this year, then got by both Schumacher and Hill. Hill briefly passed Schumacher in the esses but Schumacher retook the position. The order was: Senna, Prost, Häkkinen, Berger, Irvine and Schumacher. Schumacher would pass Irvine on lap 2 with Hill getting ahead two laps later.

Schumacher and Hill then closed in on Berger. At the end of lap 9, the three came out of the final chicane nose to tail and Hill passed Schumacher on the start/finish straight to take 5th place away. On lap 11, Hill got a run on Berger coming out of the 130R and Berger took the inside line going into the chicane. Hill tried to pass on the outside but was not able to complete the move. Schumacher, having stayed to the inside, couldn&#x27;t stop fast enough as Hill turned in behind Berger and hit Hill&#x27;s right rear wheel, damaging his left front suspension and putting himself out. Hill was able to keep going and inherited 4th on the next lap when Berger came in for tyres.

Meanwhile, Prost inherited the lead when Senna pitted for tyres. Shortly after it began to rain, which was an advantage for Prost and other drivers who had not yet stopped for tyres since they would have to make one less stop. Senna began to catch Prost as the track got wetter and on lap 21, as the rain intensified, Senna passed Prost on the approach to the Spoon curve. At the end of the lap, Senna was two seconds in front and the two both pitted for wets. Senna pulled away rapidly in the wet conditions, building over a 30-second lead by lap 27. Prost then went off at the first corner but was able to rejoin without losing time to Senna, who was delayed by traffic. The rain then stopped and drivers began coming in for slick tyres as the track began to dry. Hill rejoined after his pit stop nearly a lap down to Senna, who was still on wets. Unable to lap Hill, Senna was re-passed by Irvine, who had been lapped but was chasing Hill for 4th position. Irvine, who was also still on wets, challenged Hill in the first corner but was not able to make the pass stick while Senna waited behind to lap the pair. Senna lost 15 seconds to Prost by the time he forced his way back past Irvine and Hill let him through. At the end of lap 42, after he and Prost had made their pit stops for slicks, Senna&#x27;s lead was back up to 24 seconds. With only 12 laps remaining, Prost never challenged after that and settled for second. Häkkinen&#x27;s 3rd place was his first podium finish.

Behind, Barrichello had got Irvine during the stops for wets and then Berger&#x27;s engine failed on lap 41. With 4 laps to go and battling with Derek Warwick for 6th, Irvine ran into the back of Warwick under braking on the approach to the chicane and knocked him out of the race. Irvine was able to continue and finish with a point in his first grand prix. Irvine&#x27;s debut was slightly marred in a post-race altercation with Ayrton Senna who punched him when a discussion between the pair got heated. The incident led to rumours of Senna receiving a two-race ban, but ultimately, no penalty was issued.

Senna won ahead of Prost, Häkkinen, Hill, Barrichello and Irvine. Fastest lap of the race was set by Prost, the last of his career.

<text>The 1993 Australian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Adelaide on 7 November 1993. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 1993 Formula One World Championship.

The 79-lap race was won by Brazilian Ayrton Senna, driving a McLaren-Ford. In his last race with McLaren before joining Williams for , Senna took pole position and led from start to finish, except during the pit stops. Frenchman Alain Prost, in his final Grand Prix before retirement, finished second in his Williams-Renault, with his British teammate Damon Hill third.

Riccardo Patrese and Derek Warwick also retired from F1 after this race, Patrese having competed in a then-record 256 Grands Prix. Senna&#x27;s victory would turn out to be the 41st and last victory in his Formula One career, and the last time he would finish on the podium, score points, or even finish a race, since the following season he retired in Interlagos and Aida and died at Imola. It was also the last win for a Brazilian driver until Rubens Barrichello at the 2000 German Grand Prix.

This event was also the last race without refuelling during races (until the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix) as well as the last race for cars with active suspension and cars using electronic driver aids; the FIA banned their use for the next seven seasons, starting in , until the use of three electronic driver aid systems (namely fully-automatic gearboxes, launch control, and traction control) was eventually reintroduced and permitted at the 2001 Spanish Grand Prix, due to the FIA being unable to police the ban, and whether or not teams were secretly cheating by using these systems illegally to gain a competitive advantage, which is what led to their eventual reintroduction until the next six seasons. 

By winning this race McLaren surpassed Ferrari as the most successful F1 constructor in number of wins (until the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix). McLaren achieved the final pole position and win for their car entered in the livery of Marlboro as their title sponsor, which also would be the last pole position and win for the team until the 1997 Australian Grand Prix. This race was also the last time the Williams team was sponsored by Canon and the Benetton team was sponsored by Camel before switching to sponsorship by Rothmans and Mild Seven respectively in the 1994 season.

==Report==

===Qualifying===
Senna took his first pole position since the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix, in the process breaking a run of 24 straight poles for Williams and preventing that team from achieving a clean sweep for the season. Prost was alongside on the front row, with Damon Hill in the second Williams and Michael Schumacher in the Benetton on the second row, and Mika Häkkinen in the second McLaren and Gerhard Berger in the Ferrari on the third. Berger had his Saturday qualifying times removed after doing 18 laps, above the limit of 12. The top ten was completed by Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari, Martin Brundle in the Ligier, Patrese in the second Benetton, and Aguri Suzuki in the Footwork.

Despite being the fastest qualifier in his Ford V8-powered McLaren, Senna was some slower on the 890m-long Brabham Straight than the Renault V10-powered Williams of Hill.

===Race===
It took three attempts to get the race underway. On the first attempt, Brundle&#x27;s Ligier was left on the grid at the start of the formation lap, before Ukyo Katayama stalled his Tyrrell and the start was aborted. On the second attempt, Eddie Irvine missed his grid slot and stalled his Jordan. Again, the start was aborted. Katayama and Irvine were sent to the back of the grid for the third, successful, attempt.

The top four retained their positions into the first corner, while Häkkinen made a bad start and fell behind Berger.

While Senna pulled out a small lead, the two Williams cars and Schumacher stayed together. Schumacher pitted early on lap 15 and rejoined in fourth but his engine failed on lap 20. Senna pitted on lap 24, allowing Prost to lead until his own stop five laps later, while Häkkinen&#x27;s race went from bad to worse as he had a slow stop, allowing Alesi and Brundle to get ahead of him, before his brakes failed on lap 29.

Senna pitted for the second time on lap 55, by which time the Williamses had already made their second stops, and this enabled the Brazilian to retain a healthy lead. Meanwhile, Alesi got ahead of team-mate Berger while Patrese got ahead of Brundle. On lap 61, Hill tried to catch Prost by surprise for second place. Prost, however, moved over to block, causing Hill to back off and spin, losing time but no places.

Senna duly won from Prost by nine seconds, with Hill a further 24 seconds back. Alesi and Berger were fourth and fifth, one lap down, while Patrese was set to finish sixth in his 256th and last race, only for his fuel pressure to drop on the last lap and thus hand Brundle the last point.

Prost thus signed off on his F1 career with his fourth Drivers&#x27; Championship and 99 points. Senna&#x27;s win enabled him to secure second place in the standings with 73 points, just ahead of Hill on 69. Schumacher was fourth with 52, with a big gap to team-mate Patrese in fifth with 20, followed by Alesi (16), Brundle (13), Berger (12), Johnny Herbert (11) and Mark Blundell (10). In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams finished with 168 points - four more than their tally from 1992, and double the tally of McLaren (84). Benetton were a close third with 72, while Ferrari (28) edged out Ligier (23) for fourth.

With Prost not defending his title, the Williams cars would once again bear the numbers 0 and 2 for 1994. 

==Post-race==
During the podium celebrations, Senna invited Prost up to the top step, much to the surprise of the Frenchman. The move marked the first easing of tensions in the rivalry between the two men. Senna himself would later call the race &#x27;the end of an era&#x27;. As was tradition in Adelaide, a rock concert was held inside the circuit following the race. The concert was performed by Tina Turner as part of her What&#x27;s Love? Tour (the concert was free for anyone with a ticket to the race). At one point during the concert, Ayrton Senna appeared on the stage, much to Turner&#x27;s surprise. As a tribute to the Brazilian driver (and although she had already performed the song), Turner sang again her hit &quot;The Best&quot;.

<text>The 1994 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIII Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 27 March 1994 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo. It was the first race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race was won by German driver Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Ford, after starting from second position. Local hero Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Williams-Renault and led before being overtaken by Schumacher at the first round of pit stops, after which he spun off. Senna&#x27;s British teammate Damon Hill finished second, with Frenchman Jean Alesi third in a Ferrari.

== Background ==
The first race of the 1994 season saw five drivers made their F1 debuts: Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Olivier Panis, Jos Verstappen, Olivier Beretta and Roland Ratzenberger. There were also two new teams: Simtek, who had previously been involved in F1 as the designers of the Andrea Moda S921 in 1992, and Pacific Racing, who had enjoyed much success in lower formulae.

== Qualifying report ==
In his first race for Williams, Ayrton Senna took pole position by 0.3 of a second from Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton. Jean Alesi was third in his Ferrari, over a second behind Schumacher, with Damon Hill fourth in the other Williams. Frentzen impressed by taking fifth in his Sauber, with Gianni Morbidelli – back in F1 after contesting the 1993 Italian Superturismo Championship – taking sixth in his Footwork. The top ten was completed by Karl Wendlinger in the second Sauber, Mika Häkkinen in the McLaren, Verstappen in the second Benetton and Ukyo Katayama in the Tyrrell. Of the two new teams, Bertrand Gachot qualified 25th in his Pacific and David Brabham 26th in his Simtek, with their respective teammates Paul Belmondo and Ratzenberger failing to qualify.

== Race report ==
At the start Senna led from pole position, while Alesi overtook Schumacher. Schumacher retook second place on lap 2 and started chasing after Senna, who had pulled a four-second lead in the opening laps. Before the pit stops Schumacher had reduced the gap to just over a second, and on lap 21 the leading pair entered the pit lane together. Despite both teams running the same fuel strategy, Schumacher&#x27;s stop was faster than Senna&#x27;s, and thus he took the lead.

On lap 35, there was a four-car pile-up as Eddie Irvine and Verstappen came up to lap the Ligier of Éric Bernard. All three were rapidly closing up on Martin Brundle&#x27;s McLaren which had suffered an engine failure. Faced with the prospect of colliding with the McLaren, Irvine jinked left as Verstappen attempted an overtake on that side thus forcing Verstappen on to the grass; Verstappen then lost control of his car and somersaulted over the McLaren whilst Bernard took avoiding action to the right. Brundle&#x27;s helmet was impacted by the airborne Benetton although he escaped serious injury. Irvine was subsequently sanctioned by the FIA with a one-race ban, which was increased to three after the appeal of Jordan failed; Irvine was already under investigation due to an incident with Senna in Suzuka the year before.

Schumacher increased his lead to 10 seconds after the second round of pit stops, after which Senna started to close. By lap 55 the pair had lapped third-place runner Hill and the gap was down to 5 seconds, but then Senna lost control of his Williams and retired. After Senna&#x27;s retirement Schumacher won comfortably, a lap ahead of Hill in second place and Alesi finishing third. Rubens Barrichello, Katayama and Wendlinger completed the top six, Katayama scoring his first points.

<text>Paolo Bellasio (20 May 1554 – 10 July 1594) was an Italian composer and organist of the late Renaissance. He is generally considered to be a member of the Roman School, though unusually for the group he seems to have written only madrigals.

Information on his early life is scarce. He was born in Verona, lived in Rome in 1582 in the service of Cardinal Filippo Boncompagni, and then in the next year traveled throughout Calabria, probably looking for a job as an organist. In 1584 and 1585 he held a series of part-time posts at various churches in Rome. Orvieto Cathedral hired him in 1587, but he did not stay long, returning to Verona in 1589. In the early 1590s he returned to Rome for reasons unknown, and died there. According to his epitaph, Pope Clement VIII granted him the title Knight of the Golden Spur.

Bellasio published five books of madrigals, in a well-crafted, conservative and contrapuntal idiom. In addition he wrote a book of villanelle which included a part for lute, as well as a group of canzonettas. The lack of sacred music in his output is striking, especially for a Roman at the end of the 16th century, though perhaps some of his music has not survived.

<text>Brett Lewis Anderson (born 29 September 1967) is an English singer best known as the lead singer and primary lyricist of the band Suede. After Suede disbanded in 2003, he fronted the Tears with former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler in 2004–2006, and released four solo albums on which he also played guitar and keyboards. Suede re-formed in 2010; they continue to record and tour.

==Early years==

Anderson was born and grew up in Lindfield, Sussex, a village north-east of Haywards Heath. His mother was an artist and a dressmaker; his father was a taxi driver whom Anderson described as an &quot;obsessive classical-music fan&quot;. He attended Lindfield Junior School, Oathall Comprehensive School and Haywards Heath Sixth-Form College. In 1986 he gained A-levels in Maths, Physics and Chemistry.

In his teens Anderson played guitar for garage bands such as the Pigs and Geoff, the latter featuring future Suede bassist Mat Osman. In the late 1980s, while a student at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London, Anderson and Osman formed Suede with Anderson&#x27;s girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, and soon recruited guitarist Bernard Butler through an advertisement in &quot;NME&quot;. After they had received temporary help from former Smiths drummer Mike Joyce, in 1991 Simon Gilbert joined as their permanent drummer. Around this time Frischmann left Anderson for Blur frontman Damon Albarn, which created an early rift in the burgeoning Britpop scene of the early 1990s. After missing too many rehearsals and flaunting her relationship with Albarn while still living with Anderson, Frischmann left the band, going on to front Elastica.

==Suede (1989–2003; 2010–present)==

Even before Suede&#x27;s first album appeared in stores, Anderson&#x27;s androgynous style and vague &quot;confessions&quot; about his sexuality stirred controversy in the British music press. His infamous comment that he was &quot;a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience&quot; was indicative of how he both courted controversy and a sexually ambiguous, alienated audience. In 1993, &quot;Suede&quot; hit number one on the UK charts. Combining Morrissey&#x27;s homoerotic posturing with David Bowie&#x27;s glam theatrics, Anderson achieved rapid fame in the UK, though not in the US. Due to a trademark dispute with the American lounge singer Suede, the band were forced to change their name to The London Suede for the American market. Though songwriting partner Butler left in 1994 during the recording of second album &quot;Dog Man Star&quot;, the band continued to release critically and increasingly commercially successful material in the UK, Europe and Asia, such as 1996&#x27;s &quot;Coming Up&quot; (another number one for the band). The band went on to release &quot;Head Music&quot; (number one on the UK charts and in several countries) in 1999, but &quot;A New Morning&quot; was a commercial disappointment in 2002. In 2003, following the release of their &quot;Singles&quot; collection, Suede disbanded.

Anderson commented that the history of Suede is &quot;ridiculous. It&#x27;s like Machiavelli rewriting &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. It involves a cast of thousands. It should star Charlton Heston... it&#x27;s like a pram that&#x27;s just been pushed down a hill. It&#x27;s always been fiery and tempestuous and really on the edge and it never stops. I don&#x27;t think it ever will.&quot; As a solo musician during Suede&#x27;s career, Anderson collaborated with Stina Nordenstam and his guest vocals can be heard on the album &quot;This Is Stina Nordenstam&quot;. He also sang a duet with Jane Birkin in 1995 which appeared in 1998 on Birkin&#x27;s &quot;best of&quot; album. In addition he sang the lyric &quot;You&#x27;re going to reap just what you sow&quot; for the Children in Need charity single &quot;Perfect Day&quot;.

Following persistent rumours, the boss of the band&#x27;s former label, Nude Records&#x27; Saul Galpern, confirmed to the &quot;NME&quot; that Suede would be playing together again. &quot;It&#x27;s [for] a one-off gig,&quot; he explained of the show, which featured the band&#x27;s second incarnation. The band played London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall as part of the 2010 Teenage Cancer Trust shows. The band performed warm-up shows at the 100 Club in London and Ritz Ballroom in Manchester, and the success of the shows led to a European tour in the summer of 2010. Further festival dates occurred in 2011, along with UK dates where Suede performed their first three albums in full.

==The Tears (2004–2005)==

In 2004, Anderson and former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler briefly formed the band the Tears with Will Foster, Makoto Sakamoto and Nathan Fisher and released their debut album &quot;Here Come the Tears,&quot; which was met with generally favourable reviews. It was produced by Butler, recorded at 2 kHz Studios and Rak Studios (London) as well as at Butler&#x27;s home studio (&quot;Bernie&#x27;s Buttons&quot;), and featured the singles &quot;Refugees&quot; and &quot;Lovers&quot;. Following the cancellation of a European tour in support of the album, the band were dropped by Independiente and the project was abandoned.

==Solo work (2006–present)==

In May 2006, Anderson announced details of a solo album consisting of 11 tracks, which was released on 26 March 2007. He told &quot;NME&quot; that the title would be &quot;Brett Anderson&quot; since &quot;...that&#x27;s my name, you see.&quot; The accompanying video for Anderson&#x27;s first single &quot;Love Is Dead&quot; debuted on UK television in February 2007, quickly finding its way to YouTube. &quot;Love Is Dead&quot; made its debut at No. 42 in the UK singles chart, and the album went to No. 54 the following week. The keyboardist-producer on his album is Fred Ball, and former Suede bass player Mat Osman joined the live band on tour.

In July 2007 Anderson modelled Nick Hart for Aquascutum&#x27;s autumn/winter 2007 campaign

In May 2008 it was announced that Anderson&#x27;s second album was to be premiered on 7 July in a special concert at London&#x27;s Mermaid Theatre. A copy of the album, entitled &quot;Wilderness&quot;, was distributed to all ticket buyers, in the form of a USB stick. The album was recorded in only seven days, with most tracks recorded as live takes. He plays the piano and the acoustic guitars, and is accompanied by Amy Langley on cello. One of the songs &quot;Back to You&quot; written with Fred Ball of the Norwegian band Pleasure is a duet with French actress Emmanuelle Seigner. After this album&#x27;s release, Anderson released his solo album through his own independent label, BA Songs.

Anderson&#x27;s third album, &quot;Slow Attack&quot; was co-written with Leo Abrahams. On his website, Brett Anderson writes that he tried to use words in a different way, as fragments, and hint of meanings and emotions. The music is more orchestral than &quot;Wilderness&quot; with more instrumentation throughout the album. On tour, he was joined by Jim Dare [Minuteman], Didz Hammond (Dirty Pretty Things), Angie Pollock (Goldfrapp), Sebastian Sternberg (Pleasure, Marina and the Diamonds), Kris Sonne and Amy Langley, thus giving the songs a more art-rock edge.

&quot;Black Rainbows&quot; – Anderson&#x27;s fourth solo album was released through BA Songs, distributed by EMI Music Service in September 2011. It was preceded by the single &quot;Brittle Heart&quot;. It was the second album Anderson had co-written with Leo Abrahams and it saw a return to a simpler more commercial rock format. Anderson stated that he had taken as reference points some of his old favourite records like PIL&#x27;s &quot;Rise&quot;, and Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Juju&quot; while conceiving the songs.

== Personal life ==

In the early days of Suede&#x27;s career, Anderson made a comment that he was &quot;a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience.&quot;

The recording of Suede&#x27;s &quot;Head Music&quot; was plagued with difficulties such as Anderson&#x27;s addiction to heroin and crack cocaine which showed in his increasingly unpredictable behaviour and gaunt appearance, which contrasted with his previously healthy and androgynous appearance. While Anderson had been taking drugs moderately during Suede&#x27;s career up to that point, he was addicted for two and a half years, but stopped in late 1999, when somebody very close to him became ill. He has been clean since. Speaking of his addiction, Anderson said, &quot;Anyone who has ever tried crack will know exactly why I took it. It&#x27;s the scariest drug in the world because the hit you get from it is so, so seductive. I wanted to experience that, and I did – repeatedly.&quot;

Anderson is married to Jodie, a naturopath, with whom he has a step-son and son.

In 2018, Anderson released an autobiography titled &quot;Coal Black Mornings&quot;. The second part of the book, called &quot;Afternoon With The Blinds Drawn&quot; was released a year later.

<text>Jean Le Bel (c. 1290 – 15 February 1370) was a chronicler from Liège. 

==Biography==

Jean Le Bel&#x27;s father, Gilles le Beal des Changes, was an alderman of Liège. Jean entered the church and became a canon of the cathedral church, but he and his brother Henri followed Jean de Beaumont to England in 1327, and took part in the border warfare against the Scots. His will is dated 1369, and his epitaph gives the date of his death as 1370. Nothing more is known of his life, but Jacques de Hemricourt, author of the &quot;Miroir des nobles de Hesbaye&quot;, has left a eulogy of his character, and a description of the magnificence of his attire, his retinue and his hospitality. Hemricourt asserts that he was eighty years old or more when he died.

==Chronicles==

Jean was one of the first chroniclers to write in French instead of Latin. He was a soldier and companion of Jean, Count de Beaumont and travelled with him to England and Scotland in 1327. At the request of the duke, he wrote &quot;Vrayes Chroniques&quot; (&quot;True Chronicles&quot;), which recorded the events of the reign of Edward III. He is believed to be the first person to use interviews to confirm and supplement his facts. Jean gives as his reason for writing a desire to replace a certain misleading rhymed chronicle of the wars of Edward III by a true relation of his enterprises down to the beginning of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

For a long time Jean was only known as a chronicler through a reference by Jean Froissart; Froissart was greatly influenced by him and borrowed from his texts. Froissart names him in the prologue of the first book of his &quot;Chronicles&quot; as one of his authorities, and incorporates Le Bel&#x27;s own text, verbatim and at length, in his own book. Le Bel&#x27;s own chronicle is only preserved in a single, anonymous manuscript. A fragment of his work in the manuscript of Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse&#x27;s &quot;Ly Myreur des Histors&quot;, was discovered in 1847; and the whole of his chronicle, preserved in the library of Chálons-sur-Marne, was edited in 1863 by L. Polain.

In the matter of style Le Bel has been placed by some critics on the level of Froissart. His chief merit is his refusal to narrate events unless either he himself or his informant had witnessed them. This scrupulousness in the acceptance of evidence must be set against his limitations. He takes on the whole a similar point of view to Froissart&#x27;s; he has no concern with national movements or politics; and, writing for the public of chivalry, he preserves no general notion of a campaign, which resolves itself in his narrative into a series of exploits on the part of his heroes. Froissart was considerably indebted to him, and seems to have borrowed from him some of his best-known episodes, such as the death of Robert the Bruce, Edward III and the countess of Salisbury, and the devotion of the burghers of Calais. The songs and virelais, in the art of writing which he was, according to Hemricourt, an expert, have not come to light.

<doc id="1123195" wikidata="Q2085388" url="?curid=1123195" title="Bagdad (film)">
<text>Bagdad is a 1949 Technicolor American adventure film directed by Charles Lamont starring Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Paul Hubschmid (billed as &quot;Paul Christian&quot;), and Vincent Price. O&#x27;Hara called it &quot;a &#x27;tits and sand&#x27; picture...one of the films that I point to as part of my decorative years but audiences love them.&quot;

==Plot==
It tells the story of a Bedouin princess (Maureen O&#x27;Hara) who returns to Baghdad after being educated in England. She finds that her father has been murdered by a group of renegades. She is hosted by the Pasha (Vincent Price), the corrupt representative of the national government. She is also courted by Prince Hassan (Paul Hubschmid), who is falsely accused of the murder. The plot revolves around her attempts to bring the killer to justice while being courted by the Pasha.

The film was directed by Charles Lamont and included choreography by Lester Horton and Bella Lewitzky.

==Cast==
* Maureen O&#x27;Hara as Princess Marjan
* Paul Hubschmid as Hassan
* Vincent Price as Pasha Ali Nadim
* John Sutton as Raizul
* Jeff Corey as Mohammed Jao
* Frank Puglia as Saleel
* David Bauer as Mahmud (as David Wolfe)
* Fritz Leiber as Emir
* Otto Waldis as Marengo
* Leon Belasco as Beggar
* Anne P. Kramer as Tirza (as Ann Pearce)
* Dewey Robinson as Blackrobe (uncredited)

==Production==
In April 1949 Universal announced the film would star Yvonne de Carlo and Swiss actor Paul Christian. It would be Christian&#x27;s Hollywood debut - he had meant to star in &quot;Sword in the Desert&quot; but been ruled out due to an eye infection. De Carlo fell ill and so Universal borrowed Maureen O&#x27;Hara from 20th Century Fox; it was O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s first film at Universal.

Filming started in June. It took place on location at the Alabama Hills in Lone Pine, California. O&#x27;Hara wrote in her memoirs that she was stung by a scorpion a few days into the shoot &quot;but other than that it was an uneventful experience.&quot;

Vincent Price appeared in the movie as the last in a four-picture contract he had with Universal. “All through one week’s filming in the blistering sun, take after take was being ruined by the inhuman howls of a lady camel,” wrote Vincent Price in his book &quot;The Book of Joe&quot;. “No one could make her stop, and the furious reprimand by the sound man to the animal owner brought out the news that the camel must have fallen in love with one of the cast. It couldn’t be anyone she was used to, because it had never happened before and the crew had been around the animals for a week before we arrived. Since there were only three men, including myself, in the company and lady camels fall only for human men, it must be one of us.” After the other two men were presented to the camel with no reaction. “...the moment I appeared the great lumpy beast gave forth with the most disturbing screams of passionate anguish. I was the object of her affection and also the friendly derision of the entire company, but the film was able to continue by eliminating this camel from any scene I was in.” 

==Reception==
According to O&#x27;Hara the film &quot;made Universal and fortune and Universal purchased part of my contract from Fox as a result of that success.&quot;

<doc id="1123206" wikidata="Q424174" url="?curid=1123206" title="1994 Pacific Grand Prix">
<text>The 1994 Pacific Grand Prix (formally the I Pacific Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 17 April 1994 at the TI Circuit, Aida, Japan. It was the second race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 83-lap race was won by German driver Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Ford, after he started from second position. Brazilian Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Williams-Renault but retired following a first-corner collision with the Ferrari of Italian Nicola Larini, leaving Schumacher to lead all 83 laps. Austrian Gerhard Berger was second in the other Ferrari with another Brazilian, Rubens Barrichello, third in a Jordan-Hart, his and the Jordan team&#x27;s first podium finish.

==Background==
The Pacific Grand Prix was the first of two races scheduled to be held in Japan in 1994 with the Japanese Grand Prix due to take place at Suzuka in October. The race at the new to the calendar TI Circuit acted as a replacement for the European Grand Prix at Donington Park that had been originally scheduled for this date but was later cancelled, though the European Grand Prix would later reappear on the calendar with the event taking place in early October at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain as a replacement for the Argentine Grand Prix. Ferrari driver Jean Alesi injured his back in a testing accident at Mugello, while Jordan driver Eddie Irvine unsuccessfully appealed against the one-race ban handed to him for his involvement in the four-car accident in Brazil, this ban being increased to three races. Nicola Larini would substitute for Alesi at the Pacific race, while Aguri Suzuki would take Irvine&#x27;s place.

==Qualifying report==
Most drivers set their best qualifying times during Friday&#x27;s session, the track conditions on Saturday being slower. Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Williams by 0.22 seconds from Michael Schumacher in the Benetton. Damon Hill was third in the other Williams with Mika Häkkinen fourth in the McLaren, followed by Gerhard Berger in the Ferrari and Martin Brundle in the other McLaren. The top ten was completed by Larini in the other Ferrari, Rubens Barrichello in the Jordan, Christian Fittipaldi in the Footwork and Jos Verstappen in the other Benetton. Suzuki was 20th in the other Jordan, while the two Simteks of David Brabham and Roland Ratzenberger were 25th and 26th respectively, condemning the two Pacifics of Bertrand Gachot and Paul Belmondo to non-qualification.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
Ayrton Senna was overtaken by Schumacher before the first corner and was then hit from behind by Mika Häkkinen and spun off the track. Nicola Larini also went off the track and crashed into Senna, causing race-ending damage to both cars. Mark Blundell also spun on the same corner after a collision at the apex of the first corner, stalling his car in the middle of the track. On lap 3 Damon Hill spun off trying to overtake Hakkinen, but rejoined and climbed back to second place before stopping with transmission failure on lap 49. As Jos Verstappen in the second Benetton retired after he spun off just as soon as he came out of the pits on lap 55 as he was 3 laps behind teammate Schumacher. Martin Brundle 
meanwhile was looking secure in 3rd place after Barrichello pitted before he retired shortly after with his engine overheating on lap 68. Alboreto and Wendlinger to whom were just behind the top 6 had collided and both went off into the gravel trap forcing both drivers to retire whilst the Minardi was trying to get past the Sauber at the time. Michael Schumacher won comfortably from Gerhard Berger and Rubens Barrichello. Roland Ratzenberger&#x27;s 11th place would be the Austrian&#x27;s only finish before his death during qualifying for the following Grand Prix at Imola.

===Illegal driver aids===
During the weekend, Ferrari test driver Nicola Larini (who had replaced the injured Jean Alesi for the early part of the season), leaked to the Italian media that he had used traction control (one of the banned for 1994 electronic driver aids) during the practice session for the race. Ferrari and Larini later denied the claims to the worldwide press. The &quot;leak&quot; by Larini further raised suspicions about teams using illegal aids to help them in races. Further, after the first corner collision that put him out of the race, instead of going back to the Williams pit area, Ayrton Senna opted to sit on the wall on the outside of the turn and watch the cars for a number of laps to see if he could hear any noises that suggested traction control was being used illegally in the other cars. Senna returned to the Williams pit area after about 10 laps had been completed, suspicious that the Benetton B194 was illegal.

<text>The 1994 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 15 May 1994 at the Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo. It was the fourth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship, and the first following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks previously.

The 78-lap race was won from pole position by Michael Schumacher driving a Benetton-Ford, his fourth victory from the first four races of 1994. Martin Brundle finished second in a McLaren-Peugeot, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari.

==Report==

===Background===
After the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix, sweeping changes were announced by the FIA to the rules and regulations of Formula One in a bid to improve safety. The majority were scheduled to come into force after the Monaco Grand Prix, but an 80 km/h pit-lane speed limit was brought into force in time for this race.

Both Williams and Simtek, the teams for whom Senna and Ratzenberger drove, ran only one car each during the race weekend.

Eddie Irvine was serving the third race of his three-race ban issued to him for his part in the crash during the Brazilian Grand Prix. Andrea de Cesaris again took Irvine&#x27;s place at Jordan, whilst Irvine acted as a pit-lane reporter for ESPN.

Olivier Beretta became the first Monégasque to compete in the Monaco Grand Prix since André Testut in 1959. This was the last time a driver from Monaco competed in his home race, until Charles Leclerc took part in the 2018 race.

===Practice and qualifying===
During the first free practice session on Thursday morning, Austrian driver Karl Wendlinger had a major accident at the Nouvelle Chicane. Travelling at almost he appeared to brake too late, and the car slid sideways into the water-filled barriers. Wendlinger was knocked unconscious and was taken initially to the Princess Grace Hospital, and later to Saint Roch Hospital in Nice. He suffered a serious head injury and remained in a coma for several weeks. The Sauber-Mercedes team decided to withdraw from the race after this incident.

Michael Schumacher claimed the first pole position of his Grand Prix career. Mika Häkkinen qualified second, which was also the highest starting position thus far in his career. Martin Brundle qualified 2nd in the first qualifying session on the Thursday, three tenths of a second in front of team mate Mika Häkkinen, but could not repeat this on the Saturday and dropped to 8th. 

===Race===

As a mark of respect for Senna and Ratzenberger, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty for the race and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and Austrian flags. For the first time since the 1959 United States Grand Prix, there was no previous World Champion competing in the race and also no former Monaco Grand Prix winner. There were also only four previous race winners: Schumacher, Hill, Berger and Alboreto.

At the start of the race, Damon Hill clipped the left rear tyre of Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s McLaren just before the &quot;Sainte Dévote&quot; corner. Häkkinen retired immediately, while Hill continued for a few corners before retiring with broken right front suspension. Gianni Morbidelli and Pierluigi Martini also collided before &quot;Sainte Dévote&quot;, putting each other out. Eric Bernard in the second Ligier had soon spun out of the race at the Nouvelle chicane. 

Katayama retired his Tyrrell from 6th position on lap 39 when his gearbox failed, as of which by lap 41, the engine on Mark Blundell&#x27;s Tyrrell failed, leaving oil on the track at &quot;Sainte Dévote&quot; retiring 2 laps after Katayama which Schumacher, leading the race, had to avoid. The second placed Ferrari of Gerhard Berger did slip on the oil, however, and required a three-point turn to escape from the run off area beside the stricken Tyrrell. Berger returned to the track still in his second place, but dirty tyres left him vulnerable to the McLaren of Martin Brundle, who promptly overtook him down the outside of &quot;Mirabeau&quot; on the same lap. Christian Fittipaldi in his Footwork-Ford ran close behind the Ferraris of Berger and Alesi in fourth position until his first refuelling stop near the start of the race. Fittipaldi continued to run strongly in a points position until lap 47 when the gearbox failed.

The race was led from start to finish by Schumacher, who continued his perfect start to the 1994 season with four victories in the first four races. As Schumacher also held the fastest lap, this meant he scored the first Grand Slam of his career, and he was the first driver other than Alain Prost or Ayrton Senna to win the Monaco Grand Prix since 1983. Brundle&#x27;s second place equalled the best finish of his F1 career. Michele Alboreto finished sixth in his Minardi to score his final point in F1.

<text>The 1994 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 29 May 1994 at the Circuit de Catalunya, Montmeló. It was the 36th Spanish Grand Prix and the fourth to be held at the Circuit de Catalunya, and the fifth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 65-lap race was won by Englishman Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. It was the first victory of the season for Hill and the Williams team, who were still recovering from the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola four weeks previously. Hill won by 24 seconds from German driver and championship leader Michael Schumacher, whose Benetton-Ford was stuck in fifth gear for most of the race. Another Englishman, Mark Blundell, finished third in a Tyrrell-Yamaha, which would turn out to be the final podium finish for him and the Tyrrell team.

The Grand Prix was additionally notable for the season-ending crash of debutant Italian driver Andrea Montermini in his Simtek S941 on the front straight. Montermini, elevated from test driver status after the death of Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix crashed heavily into the outside wall exiting the final corner. It also marked the Formula One debut of future race winner David Coulthard, replacing Senna for Williams. The new Lotus 109 made its debut this weekend replacing the two-year-old 107.

== Report ==

=== Pre-race ===

This was the first race for the newly formed Grand Prix Drivers Association (GPDA). Several top level names, including Michael Schumacher, Damon Hill, and Gerhard Berger, were instrumental in the setup and running of the GPDA, and they took the decision to install a temporary chicane before the Nissan corner. This was an attempt to improve safety, as well as limit speeds around the track, as the Nissan corner was generally taken at near flat-out speeds.

Sauber entered only one car for this race due to Karl Wendlinger&#x27;s injury at the previous race.

=== Qualifying ===
Michael Schumacher took the second pole position in succession and the second of his career. Damon Hill also lined up on the front row, his time had been beaten by Schumacher&#x27;s by over half a second, and he was only one thousandth of a second ahead of Mika Häkkinen. The pair&#x27;s respective Williams and McLaren teammates lined up eighth and ninth, McLaren&#x27;s Martin Brundle on the fourth row in front of a disappointed David Coulthard for Williams. Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton teammate – JJ Lehto – had done a bit better for himself and lined up fourth. Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s Jordan qualified in fifth, followed by the two Ferraris. Tyrrell driver Ukyo Katayama was the other driver in the top ten, while at the back Andrea Montermini crashed heavily in the Simtek previously driven by Roland Ratzenberger and broke his ankles. He thus did not set a timed lap in the second session, and failed to qualify, although he would have been unable to start the race anyway.

=== Race ===
Olivier Beretta retired when his Larousse-Ford&#x27;s engine failed on the formation lap. Schumacher led from pole position at the start of the race whilst Barrichello and Berger collided at the first corner. Neither driver retired as a direct result of the collision, although both did eventually, but Berger was forced to run across the grass and lost places and would eventually retire on lap 28 with gearbox problems.
Coulthard climbed up to fifth place from his ninth place starting spot, but his car stalled in the pits on lap 16. Despite retiring from twelfth place on lap 32 with electrical problems, he described his race as a &quot;good debut overall&quot;. While Williams notched up their first victory of the season, and first after the death of Ayrton Senna, championship leader Michael Schumacher finished a strong second, despite being stuck in fifth gear for most of the race. Knowing that he had a major problem, he managed to make a pitstop (and get away from the pit stop in 5th gear), and as the race unfolded gave nothing to the leading Hill&#x27;s pace. He had to change his driving style to find new trajectories and corner apexes, and his past experience as a World Sports Car driver helped him to do so. Meanwhile Rubens Barrichello retired after he spun off near the pit entry on lap 40 and Schumacher was once again able to make a pitstop and not stall the car. After the pit stops, Mika Häkkinen was in third place for McLaren behind Hill and Schumacher, having temporarily been in front of Schumacher earlier in the race. Häkkinen&#x27;s engine failed as did JJ Lehto&#x27;s Benetton-Ford engine 5 laps after Hakkinen on lap 54, though granting the place to Hakkinen&#x27;s teammate Martin Brundle. Brundle then retired himself after a transmission explosion from the back of his car at the first corner by lap 60 and was classified 11th. Mark Blundell, for Tyrrell, completed the podium celebrations, scoring his 3rd and last podium of his career.

=== Post-race ===
After the race, the Williams team were very emotional with Hill&#x27;s win.

<text>The 1994 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 12 June 1994 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was the sixth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship and the 32nd Canadian Grand Prix.

The 69-lap race was won from pole position by Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Ford, with Damon Hill second in a Williams-Renault and Jean Alesi third in a Ferrari. The win, Schumacher&#x27;s fifth of the season, put him 33 points clear of Hill in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

==Report==

===Background===
A temporary chicane was inserted between the hairpin and the Casino corner on the back straight, so as to decrease top speed and increase safety in the wake of Ayrton Senna&#x27;s fatal crash at Imola. Teams had also been ordered to cut holes in the airboxes on the back of the cars, so as to decrease the &#x27;ram air&#x27; effect and thus decrease engine output. As the FIA did not standardize where the holes had to be cut, each team interpreted the rule in different ways. Teams were also running on &#x27;pump fuel&#x27; as of this race, in a bid to further lower engine output and trap speeds.

Simtek entered only one car for Canada, following the injuries to Andrea Montermini at the previous race in Spain. Andrea de Cesaris replaced the injured Karl Wendlinger at Sauber, and would thus make his 200th Grand Prix start at Montreal.

===Race===
Michael Schumacher took his fifth victory from six races in his Benetton, finishing nearly 40 seconds ahead of Damon Hill&#x27;s Williams. Ferrari driver Jean Alesi finished third, just ahead of teammate Gerhard Berger, the last driver on the lead lap. Hill&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard was fifth, scoring his first points in Formula One, while Christian Fittipaldi crossed the line sixth but was disqualified when his Footwork was found to be underweight. Schumacher&#x27;s teammate JJ Lehto was therefore promoted to sixth, scoring his last career point in Formula One.

During the race, Érik Comas became the first Formula One driver to be penalised for speeding in the pit lane; he received a ten-second stop-go penalty.

<doc id="1123216" wikidata="Q1015661" url="?curid=1123216" title="Inangahua Junction">
<text>Inangahua is a small settlement in the northwest of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It consists of three settled areas: Inangahua Junction at the confluence of the Inangahua and Buller Rivers, north of Reefton and southeast of Westport; Inangahua Landing, 10 km further up the Inangahua River; and Inangahua township, 2 km east of the Junction. Murchison is further east. After the 1968 Inangahua Earthquake, most of the inhabitants left the area or shifted to the township, which is now the population centre and known simply as Inangahua.

Inangahua&#x27;s main industries include forestry, coal, farming and sawmilling. There is a small primary school, shops, fire station and earthquake museum.

== Name ==
The name of the town refers to &quot;inanga&quot;, the Māori word for whitebait (&quot;Galaxias&quot; spp.) and &quot;hua&quot;, the act of drying and preserving them in sealed containers; the river was known for its abundance of fish. Inangahua Junction was formerly known as Christies Junction.

== Inangahua Landing ==
Before the construction of the Buller Gorge road, the only way to travel inland from Westport was by river. At the beginning of the West Coast gold rush, mining equipment and quartz-crushing machinery was ferried up the Buller River to its confluence with the Inangahua, then about 10 km up the Inangahua as far as &quot;The Landing&quot;, from which it was transported overland south to Reefton. At the height of the gold rush over 1000 prospectors were working in tributaries of the Inangahua.

==Earthquake==

The town was substantially affected by an earthquake on Friday, 24 May 1968. At 5:24 am, the earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale struck the town, and many landslides and aftershocks followed. The entire population of around 100 was temporarily evacuated. There were no fatalities in the town, but a woman and her visiting mother were killed when the house they were in, along the Inangahua Junction to Westport road, was crushed by a landslide on the cliffs above their house, while a man died near Greymouth when his car hit a section of road on that suddenly subsided on the run-up to a bridge. Another three died days later when a helicopter surveying downed telephone lines crashed.

==Railways==
Inangahua Junction is located on the Stillwater - Westport Line railway, and was intended to be the junction of this line with the never-completed Nelson Section. In 1914, the railway was opened to Inangahua Junction from its former terminus in Cronadun, but subsequent progress through the Buller Gorge was slow. In July 1942, trains began running the full length of the line between Stillwater and Westport, but the line was not officially opened until 5 December 1943. With the commencement of through services, passenger trains were operated by RM class Vulcan railcars, which connected in Stillwater with services that ran along the Midland Line between Greymouth and Christchurch. In 1967, the passenger services ceased, and today, the primary traffic is coal, with multiple coal trains passing through Inangahua Junction daily. Today the town is served by the daily inter city bus between Nelson and Westport.

==PHAT Music Festival==
Inangahua was the host of the PHAT New Year&#x27;s Eve music festivals. PHAT07, PHAT08, PHAT09, PHAT10 (with Australian band Pendulum and NZers Black Seeds, Kora, Salmonella Dub, Tiki and Concord Dawn), PHAT11 featured New Zealand and many international acts. PHAT is held on flat clearings surrounded by native bush on Rough Creek Road, off Browns Creek Road, south of Inangahua and owned by the Storer family. Approximately 5000 people attend the PHAT music festivals, with 48+ hours of continuous performance on two stages.

The other annual event held on the Inangahua site was PHAT MOON, a slightly smaller version of the bigger New Year&#x27;s Eve&#x27;s event. 
PHAT MOON was held over Easter weekend. The music runs for 24 hours, but people are invited to come and camp the night before.
This ceased quite a few years ago; the site has returned to being a farm.

==Education==
Inangahua Junction School was a coeducational contributing primary (years 1–6) school. The school was in existence in 1887. It closed in 2018.

Inangahua College merged with Reefton School to form Reefton Area School in 2004. The College, which existed for 38 years, replaced the Reefton District High School.

<text>The 1994 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 10 July 1994. It was the eighth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 60-lap race was won from pole position by local driver Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, German Michael Schumacher, crossed the line second in his Benetton-Ford, but was subsequently disqualified for overtaking Hill on the formation lap and failing to serve a stop-go penalty in time; he was also given a two-race ban. Frenchman Jean Alesi was thus classified second in his Ferrari, with Finn Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Peugeot.

== Report ==

=== Pre-race ===
Going into this race, Benetton&#x27;s Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 66 points out of a possible 70. Williams&#x27; Damon Hill was second on 29 points, followed by Ferrari drivers Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi on 17 and 13 respectively. Benetton led the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 67 points, followed by Ferrari on 36 and Williams on 31.

Following his appearance at the previous round in France, Nigel Mansell had returned to his CART commitments in America, so David Coulthard returned in the second Williams to partner Hill.

=== Qualifying ===
Qualifying was extremely close with Hill, Schumacher and Berger in competition for pole position. Berger collided with the barrier at the end of the pitlane as he attempted to have another lap. Hill took pole position with a time of 1:24.960. Schumacher took second position on the grid, three thousandths of a second slower than Hill and Berger third, two hundredths of a second behind Hill.

=== Race ===
On the formation lap, Schumacher overtook Hill twice (once when leaving the dummy grid, and then once more further round the lap), before dropping back to take his second place on the grid for the start.
David Coulthard stalled on the grid at the start, forcing him to start from the back of the grid – he fought back to finish 5th. This prompted another formation lap, on which Eddie Irvine&#x27;s car broke down. Again on this second formation lap, Schumacher overtook Hill twice. The Peugeot V10 engine in Martin Brundle&#x27;s McLaren MP4/9 failed on the second start in a huge fireball.

On lap 14, Michael Schumacher was handed a five-second stop-go penalty for overtaking Hill on the first formation lap. He failed to serve the penalty by lap 21, and as a result was shown the black flag, requiring him to stop immediately at the pits. Schumacher did not acknowledge the black flag and was shown it again on both of the next two laps, he later claimed that he had not seen it. Benetton told the race officials that there had been a misunderstanding over the 5-second stop-go penalty, and after discussing the issue with the team the officials withdrew the black flag and Schumacher finally served the stop-go penalty at the end of lap 27.

Mika Häkkinen and Rubens Barrichello collided while battling for 4th place at the final corner. Barrichello pulled his damaged car into the pits, without realising that he was on the final lap. This allowed Häkkinen to limp over the finish line before Barrichello reached it, despite his car being more severely damaged.

Behind them, Ukyo Katayama scored what proved to be his final point.

=== Post-race ===
The stewards fined Benetton $25,000 and gave the team and their driver Michael Schumacher a severe reprimand for ignoring Schumacher&#x27;s five-second stop-go penalty and the subsequent black flag. On 26 July, the FIA World Motorsport Council increased the penalty to a $500,000 fine for the team and a two race ban for Schumacher. The WMSC also disqualified Schumacher from his second place at the British Grand Prix. The penalty was upheld on appeal on 30 August.

<doc id="1123219" wikidata="Q297030" url="?curid=1123219" title="1994 German Grand Prix">
<text>The 1994 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 31 July 1994 at the Hockenheimring, Hockenheim. It was the ninth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 45-lap race was won from pole position by Austrian driver Gerhard Berger, driving a Ferrari. Berger achieved the first victory for the Ferrari team since the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix, some 59 races previously. In a race of high attrition, including eleven retirements on the opening lap, only eight cars finished, with French drivers Olivier Panis and Éric Bernard second and third respectively in their Ligier-Renaults.

==Background==
The fast Hockenheim circuit had been modified from the year before, with the fast Senna chicane being made slower.

==Qualifying report==
The Ferraris filled the front row of the grid, Gerhard Berger taking pole position by 0.43 seconds from Jean Alesi. Damon Hill was third in his Williams, with Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Michael Schumacher fourth in his Benetton. The Tyrrells impressed with Ukyo Katayama fifth and Mark Blundell seventh, with David Coulthard between them in the second Williams. Completing the top ten were Mika Häkkinen in the McLaren, Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the Sauber and Eddie Irvine in the Jordan. Once again, the Pacifics of Paul Belmondo and Bertrand Gachot failed to qualify, with Belmondo, the faster of the two, nearly two seconds slower than the 26th and last qualifier, Jean-Marc Gounon in the Simtek.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
The race was notable for its high rate of attrition, with 11 retirements on the opening lap. Within ten seconds of the start Alessandro Zanardi and Andrea de Cesaris tangled towards the back of the pack, taking out both Michele Alboreto and Pierluigi Martini before even reaching the first corner. Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard then tangled going into the first corner, the Finn sliding in front of a group of cars into the wall on the outside of the circuit while the Scot continued to the pits to replace his front wing. Unfortunately, for the cars that had been eliminated, the Clerk of the Course opted not to red flag the race.

Mark Blundell braked hard to avoid the McLaren only to be hit from behind by Eddie Irvine, while Rubens Barrichello and Heinz-Harald Frentzen had nowhere to go but the gravel. Barrichello retired on the spot, but Frentzen stopped towards the end of the lap with broken suspension and a punctured tyre. In the melee behind this incident, Johnny Herbert and Martin Brundle tangled, the McLaren spinning out and the Lotus retiring later on in the lap with a broken front suspension. Damon Hill also damaged his suspension in a first-lap contact with Ukyo Katayama and, along with a very long pitstop, circulated outside the points for the remainder of the race. This result would have significant consequences for Hill at the end of the season. 

Meanwhile Jean Alesi had gotten away unscathed, having qualified second, only for his Ferrari to stop with electrical problems on the run to the first chicane. It was a bad weekend for the Benetton team. After the first lap mayhem, Schumacher went on to take on the leading Ferrari of Gerhard Berger but fell away with engine problems very quickly. Then, a few laps later, Benetton driver Jos Verstappen also came into the pits; while refuelling, some fuel was accidentally sprayed onto the hot bodywork of the car, and a few seconds later the fuel ignited and Verstappen&#x27;s car was engulfed in a ball of flames. The Dutchman escaped the incident with burns around his eyes, as he had his visor up during the pit stop. No other crew members or any persons were injured severely. As well as Ferrari winning its first and only race of the 1994 Formula One season (and the first Ferrari F1 win since the 1990 F1 season), the race was especially good for Ligier with Olivier Panis finishing second, in his first career podium in Formula One, and Éric Bernard coming home third, achieving his only podium. Christian Fittipaldi finished fourth, scoring what would be his last points in Formula One, ahead of Gianni Morbidelli in fifth. Érik Comas finished sixth achieving his and Larrousse&#x27;s last Formula One points.

<text>The 1994 Hungarian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 14 August 1994 at the Hungaroring, Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary. It was the tenth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 77-lap race was won from pole position by Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Ford. Schumacher&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship rival, Damon Hill, finished second in a Williams-Renault, with Jos Verstappen third in the other Benetton-Ford after Martin Brundle suffered an electrical failure in his McLaren-Peugeot on the final lap. Brundle was partnered for this race by McLaren tester Philippe Alliot, deputising for a suspended Mika Häkkinen.

The win, Schumacher&#x27;s seventh of the season, meant that his lead over Hill in the Drivers&#x27; Championship stood at 31 points with six races remaining.

Jos Verstappen&#x27;s podium finish was the first achieved by a Dutch driver in F1.

Benetton and McLaren were both in trouble with issues found by the FIA after the German Grand Prix. Benetton were troubled with the result of Jos Verstappen&#x27;s fiery pit stop at Hockenheimring, which was caused by the team removing a filter from the fuelling system. The FIA believed it allowed a piece of debris to become lodged within a valve of the nozzle that caused the fuel to spill out onto the bodywork. It was highly criticised by the FIA with the design of the fuel rig, as to which the FIA had required all teams to use with the regulation changes. McLaren were troubled with the result of Mika Häkkinen receiving a one race ban for causing a crash on the first lap of the German Grand Prix and was replaced by Philippe Alliot who made his first grand prix since the French Grand Prix the previous year but had spun off the circuit during first practice which left to take over Brundle&#x27;s car. This did not bring much satisfaction for the head of Peugeot engineering and fellow Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jabouille, who had been actively campaigning the McLaren management to replace Brundle with Alliot for several months.

== Qualifying ==

The front row was locked out by the championship contenders Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill with Schumacher half a second quicker than Hill with the Benetton of Schumacher also quickest during the Sunday morning warm-up. With the top ten being completed by Coulthard third in the other Williams, Berger fourth for Ferrari as Berger&#x27;s teammate Alesi could do not better than 13th due to handling issues behind Jos Verstappen&#x27;s Benetton but also ahead of Alliot&#x27;s McLaren who was 14th (which left McLaren separated by eight places), Katayama fifth for Tyrrell, Brundle sixth for McLaren, Eddie Irvine seventh for Jordan, Frentzen eighth for Sauber, Panis was ninth for Ligier &amp; Rubens Barrichello completing the top ten in the other Jordan.

== Race ==
Despite being on the clean side of the track, Schumacher got off to a bad start compared to Hill&#x27;s Williams but managed to brake later than Hill allowing him to retake the lead ahead of Hill, Coulthard, Berger, Katayama, and Brundle through turn 1. The Jordans of Irvine and Barrichello were quick and surpassed Brundle and Katayama, but the Jordan teammates collided at the second turn and took off Katayama as well forcing all three drivers to immediately retire. Alesi was able to pass Panis for sixth. Nothing changed in the order after the first round of pit stops, but eventually there was action behind as Berger stalled which left him to drop behind Brundle, Alesi, and Verstappen. Ferrari&#x27;s bad luck continued as Alesi&#x27;s engine failed on lap 59 and left oil on the track which caused David Coulthard to spin off and crash out of third place into the wall a lap later as the other Ferrari of Gerhard Berger also retired with engine failure on lap 73. Martin Brundle stopped on the last lap with an electrical failure, denying him of a podium and handing his place to Jos Verstappen who was just behind him. Michael Schumacher claimed his seventh victory of the season ahead of Damon Hill, teammate Jos Verstappen (the first Dutchman to climb the podium in the category), Martin Brundle, Mark Blundell for Tyrrell and Olivier Panis scoring sixth for Ligier.

<text>The 1994 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 28 August 1994 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, near the village of Francorchamps, Wallonia. It was the eleventh race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 44-lap race was won by British driver Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. After Brazilian Rubens Barrichello took the first pole position for the Jordan team, German Michael Schumacher crossed the finish line first in his Benetton-Ford, only to be disqualified due to excessive wear on the wooden skid block underneath his car. Hill was thus awarded the win, his third of the season, with Finn Mika Häkkinen second in a McLaren-Peugeot and Schumacher&#x27;s Dutch teammate Jos Verstappen third.

This was the last time a race winning driver was disqualified until George Russell 30 years later at the same circuit.

==Report==
===Background===
Having deputised for a suspended Mika Häkkinen at McLaren at the previous race in Hungary, Philippe Alliot now returned to his old Larrousse team for this race, taking the place of Olivier Beretta. Meanwhile, the cash-strapped Lotus replaced Alessandro Zanardi with local driver Philippe Adams, who brought significant funding to the team.

Following the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at Imola earlier in the season, a chicane was installed at Eau Rouge to slow the cars.

===Qualifying===

The Friday qualifying session was held in wet but drying conditions. Towards the end of the session, the Jordan cars were sent out on slick tyres, and Rubens Barrichello duly put his car on provisional pole with teammate Eddie Irvine fourth. More rain fell on Saturday, with most of the drivers lapping several seconds slower than the day before, and only Christian Fittipaldi improving his time. Thus, Barrichello took the first pole position of his career and the first for Jordan. At 22 years and 98 days, Barrichello became the youngest ever F1 polesitter up to that point, beating the record set by Andrea de Cesaris at the 1982 United States Grand Prix West.

Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Michael Schumacher was second in his Benetton, with Damon Hill third in his Williams. After Irvine came Jean Alesi in the Ferrari, Jos Verstappen in the second Benetton, David Coulthard in the second Williams and the returning Häkkinen, with Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the Sauber and Pierluigi Martini in the Minardi completing the top ten.

===Race===

In dry conditions, Barrichello led away from Schumacher and a fast-starting Alesi. Schumacher passed Barrichello at Les Combes, and Alesi soon followed, only for his engine to fail on lap 3. With the Jordans struggling to hold on to track position against faster cars, Hill moved into second, ahead of Coulthard and Häkkinen. Gerhard Berger in the remaining Ferrari also retired with engine failure by lap 12. Philippe Adams who made his debut Grand Prix appearance at his home circuit soon spun out into the gravel trap, five laps after Berger retired.

Coulthard overtook teammate Hill during the first round of pit stops, while Barrichello moved back up to second before making his stop. On lap 19, Schumacher spun exiting Fagnes but retained the lead; the following lap, Barrichello spun into retirement at Pouhon and clipped the armco barrier giving his Jordan 194 terminal suspension damage. Martin Brundle moved into fifth in the second McLaren, before he himself had spun off and clipped the armco like Barrichello by lap 25.

When Schumacher and Hill made their second pit stops on lap 28, Coulthard led a lap for the first time in his F1 career. After making his own second stop, he remained ahead of Hill until the Williams team called him in on lap 37 to check his rear wing. He then developed gearbox problems and was passed by Häkkinen, Verstappen and Mark Blundell in the Tyrrell. On lap 40, Coulthard hit the back of Blundell&#x27;s car going through La Source; both were able to continue, with Coulthard apologising to Blundell afterwards. Eddie Irvine was the final retirement with the result of an alternator failure with only 3 laps to go and was classified 14th, leaving 13 runners left in the race up to the finish.

Though Hill set the fastest lap of the race on lap 41, Schumacher crossed the finish line some 13 seconds ahead, with Häkkinen a further 51 seconds back and Verstappen, Coulthard, Blundell and Morbidelli completing the top six.

===Post-race===
Shortly after the race, excessive wear was found on the wooden skid block on the underside of Schumacher&#x27;s car. The skid block was a mandatory requirement on all cars, introduced two races before in Germany, to increase ride height and reduce ground effect advantages. Wear on the skid block of up to 1mm was permitted; any greater would make the ride height too low and result in an illegal aerodynamic advantage. The Benetton team claimed that the excessive wear resulted from Schumacher&#x27;s spin on lap 19, but the stewards rejected the claim because of the wear pattern. Schumacher was thus disqualified and Hill awarded the victory, with Häkkinen second, Verstappen third, Coulthard fourth, Blundell fifth and Gianni Morbidelli sixth in the Footwork.

Schumacher&#x27;s lead over Hill in the Drivers&#x27; Championship was reduced to 21 points with five races remaining.

<text>The 1994 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Pioneer 65º Gran Premio d&#x27;Italia) was a Formula One motor race held on 11 September 1994 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Monza. It was the twelfth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by British driver Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, with Austria&#x27;s Gerhard Berger second in a Ferrari and Finland&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Peugeot. Frenchman Jean Alesi took pole position in the other Ferrari and led before suffering a gearbox failure on lap 15.

The win enabled Hill to move to within 11 points of Michael Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Schumacher was banned for this race and the following race in Portugal for his actions at the British Grand Prix; his place at Benetton was taken by Finland&#x27;s JJ Lehto, who had been his teammate earlier in the season.

The day after the race, Lotus went into receivership; however, they would compete in the remaining races of the 1994 season. Lotus had brought an upgraded Mugen engine to Monza, allowing Johnny Herbert to qualify in a season-best fourth place; hopes of a points finish were ended by a first-corner collision with Eddie Irvine&#x27;s Jordan.

==Background==
The Grand Prix was originally cancelled on 12 August 1994 when local officials refused a demand to cut down 123 trees for reasons related to safety. The trees in question were located at the Lesmo corners which lacked suitable run off-areas. After the announcement, Gianni Letta, an Italian cabinet under-secretary, went to Cannes to meet with FIA president Max Mosley to discuss the issue. The meeting, also attended by Ferrari driver and representative to the drivers Gerhard Berger, agreed that changes to the shape of the curve would reduce its speed.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
To the delight of the &quot;Tifosi&quot;, Jean Alesi took pole position in his Ferrari with teammate Berger second, some 0.134 seconds behind. It was the first pole position for Ferrari at Monza since Mario Andretti in 1982, and the first all-Ferrari front row at the circuit since Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni in 1975. Damon Hill was third in his Williams-Renault, with Johnny Herbert a surprise fourth in the Lotus, running an upgraded Mugen engine. David Coulthard was fifth in the other Williams, with Olivier Panis sixth in the Ligier. The top ten was completed by Mika Häkkinen in the McLaren, Andrea de Cesaris in the Sauber, Eddie Irvine in the Jordan and Jos Verstappen in the Benetton.

===Qualifying classification===

* Eddie Irvine&#x27;s Friday qualifying times were deleted because he completed 13 laps, one over the limit, during the session.
* Paul Belmondo did not take part in the Saturday qualifying session after destroying his car in a crash in the morning&#x27;s practice session.

==Race==
===Race report===
Alesi and Berger got off the line well heading into turn 1, with Herbert moving ahead of Hill into third. Behind them, the fast-starting Irvine locked up, causing him to hit Herbert. The Lotus was pitched into a spin, clipping Coulthard&#x27;s right rear. Several other cars became involved, blocking the track and stopping the race. Herbert was forced to take the second start from the pit lane in his spare car, minus the upgraded Mugen engine, while Coulthard was forced to use Hill&#x27;s spare car and Irvine was demoted to the back of the grid.

At the second start, both Ferraris again got away well, followed by Hill and Coulthard. Behind them, Verstappen tangled with Alessandro Zanardi in the second Lotus going into the Curva Grande, also forcing Gianni Morbidelli&#x27;s Footwork into the outer wall and putting all three drivers out. Herbert&#x27;s race ended on lap 14 when his alternator failed. On lap 15, Alesi came in for his first pit stop with an 11-second lead over Berger; disaster then struck as his tried to exit his pit box and his gearbox failed. Berger inherited the lead until lap 24, when he too ran into trouble during his pit stop: he was about to pull away when the incoming Panis came past, costing him enough time to drop behind Hill and Coulthard and prompting the &quot;Tifosi&quot; to jeer the Ligier mechanics.

A high attrition rate continued to build: the Saubers of de Cesaris and Heinz-Harald Frentzen suffered engine failures on laps 21 and 23 respectively, while the Minardis also retired within two laps of each other, Michele Alboreto&#x27;s gearbox failing on lap 29 and Pierluigi Martini spinning off at the Variante Ascari on lap 31. Mark Blundell also spun out at the Variante Ascari in his Tyrrell on lap 40, before Irvine&#x27;s engine failed on lap 42. Ukyo Katayama took advantage to run fifth in the second Tyrrell, only to himself spin off on lap 46 at the second Lesmo corner. After David Brabham dropped out with a puncture in his Simtek on lap 47, only ten cars remained in the race.

In the closing laps, Hill maintained a narrow lead over Coulthard, while the recovering Berger closed on both Williams. Then, rounding the Parabolica on the final lap, Coulthard suddenly coasted to a stop, out of fuel. Hill was thus left to win by 4.9 seconds from Berger, with Häkkinen taking the final podium place, a further 21 seconds back. Rubens Barrichello took fourth in the second Jordan and Martin Brundle fifth in the second McLaren, with Coulthard classified sixth.

<text>The 1994 Portuguese Grand Prix (formally the XXIII Grande Premio de Portugal) was a Formula One motor race held at Estoril on 25 September 1994. It was the thirteenth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race was won by Briton Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. Teammate David Coulthard finished second, achieving his first podium finish, with Finn Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Peugeot. The win, Hill&#x27;s fifth of the season and third in succession, enabled him to move within one point of Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, German Michael Schumacher, while the 1-2 finish allowed Williams to take over the lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship from Benetton.

== Background ==
With Michael Schumacher still banned, the Benetton team continued to run JJ Lehto alongside Jos Verstappen, while the financially-troubled Lotus team brought back Philippe Adams to partner Johnny Herbert.

== Qualifying report ==

During the Friday qualifying session, Eddie Irvine spun his Jordan and in the process collided with Damon Hill&#x27;s Williams. Hill&#x27;s car flipped upside down, but he escaped unhurt. Irvine was warned a similar incident would see his Super Licence revoked.

Gerhard Berger took pole position, his second of the season and the third for Ferrari, by 0.158 seconds from Hill. On the second row of the grid were David Coulthard in the other Williams and Mika Häkkinen in the McLaren, and on the third row were Jean Alesi in the other Ferrari and Ukyo Katayama in the Tyrrell. The top ten was completed by Martin Brundle in the other McLaren, Rubens Barrichello in the other Jordan, Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the Sauber, and Verstappen. Once again, the Pacifics of Bertrand Gachot and Paul Belmondo were the two non-qualifiers.

=== Qualifying classification ===

== Race report ==

Gerhard Berger led in the early stages for Ferrari, ahead of Coulthard who had got ahead of Hill on the start. Berger retired on lap 8 with his gearbox failed, and Katayama&#x27;s gearbox also failed by lap 27, which promoted Rubens Barrichello into the points for Jordan. Coulthard ran wide whilst trying to lap a backmarker on lap 33 which allowed Hill to edge ahead of the Scotsman. By lap 39 the other Ferrari of Jean Alesi had retired after colliding with the Simtek of David Brabham while trying to lap him. Soon afterwards, Jos Verstappen was able to pass Martin Brundle&#x27;s McLaren for 5th. Damon Hill went on to take his third consecutive race win, ahead of Coulthard. The 1-2 finish gave Williams the lead in the Constructors Championship. Mika Hakkinen finished third for McLaren, Barrichello 4th for Jordan, Verstappen 5th for Benetton and Martin Brundle 6th in the second McLaren. Olivier Panis originally finished 9th but was disqualified for having illegal skidblock wear.

<text>The 1994 European Grand Prix (formally the XXXIX Gran Premio de Europa) was a Formula One motor race held on 16 October 1994 at the Circuito Permanente de Jerez, Jerez, Spain. It was the fourteenth race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship.

The 69-lap race was won from pole position by Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Ford. Schumacher, returning from a two-race ban, took his eighth victory of the season by 24.6 seconds from Drivers&#x27; Championship rival Damon Hill in the Williams-Renault, with Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Peugeot.

The win put Schumacher five points ahead of Hill with two races remaining, while Benetton regained the lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship from Williams.

==Background==
The 1994 European Grand Prix was originally intended to take place on 17 April 1994 at Donington Park in the United Kingdom as the second round of the season but the Donington event was later cancelled and replaced by the Pacific Grand Prix at the TI Aida Circuit in Japan. The Argentine Grand Prix had been due to return to the Formula One calendar on this October date, but ongoing modernisation of the Buenos Aires circuit meant that this was postponed until early in the season. A race at Jerez, the first since , was organised in its place, and the European Grand Prix moniker was used as with the race at Donington Park in 1993 with the Spanish Grand Prix moniker having already used for the race held at the Circuit de Catalunya earlier that year .

Michael Schumacher returned to the Benetton team following his ban from the Italian and Portuguese Grands Prix, while Nigel Mansell returned to Williams, the 1994 CART season having ended the previous week. Elsewhere, Flavio Briatore bought Johnny Herbert&#x27;s contract from Lotus&#x27;s administrators and transferred him to Ligier, trading places with Éric Bernard, while rookies Hideki Noda and Domenico Schiattarella joined the Larrousse and Simtek teams respectively, replacing Yannick Dalmas and Jean-Marc Gounon.

==Qualifying==
===Qualifying report===
Schumacher took pole from Drivers&#x27; Championship rival Damon Hill by 0.13 seconds, with Mansell third but sixth tenths of a second behind Hill. Heinz-Harald Frentzen took fourth in the Sauber, followed by Rubens Barrichello in the Jordan and Gerhard Berger in the Ferrari. Herbert was seventh in the Ligier, with Gianni Morbidelli in the Footwork, Mika Häkkinen in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine in the second Jordan completing the top ten. Debutants Noda and Schiattarella were 24th and 26th respectively, with the two Pacifics of Bertrand Gachot and Paul Belmondo once again failing to qualify.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
===Race report===
At the start, Hill got ahead of Schumacher, while Mansell fell to sixth behind Frentzen, Barrichello and Berger. Mansell re-passed Berger on lap 2 and Barrichello on lap 6, before the Jordan driver got by again on lap 12. Noda&#x27;s debut ended with a gearbox failure after ten laps; as he slowed, he was hit by Mansell, who subsequently pitted for a new nosecone and dropped out of contention.

Schumacher overtook Hill during the first round of pit stops; both were well clear of Frentzen - who was running a one-stop strategy - with Häkkinen up to fourth and Irvine fifth. Hill briefly went ahead again during the second stops, after which Schumacher retained a comfortable lead for the rest of the race. Frentzen&#x27;s strategy backfired as he fell to seventh, behind Berger and Barrichello. Irvine moved ahead of Häkkinen and into third, only to be re-passed by the McLaren driver as a result of a quicker second stop. In the closing stages, Barrichello developed a left rear puncture, putting Frentzen back in the top six, just ahead of Ukyo Katayama&#x27;s Tyrrell.

In a race of high reliability, nineteen cars were still running at the end, the last being Schiattarella (albeit five laps down), while Mansell was the last driver to retire, spinning off on lap 48. Schumacher&#x27;s eventual margin of victory over Hill was 24.6 seconds, with another 45 seconds back to Häkkinen and a further nine back to Irvine, the last driver on the lead lap. Berger and Frentzen completed the top six, Frentzen holding off Katayama for the final point by 0.2 seconds. With two races remaining, Schumacher led Hill in the Drivers&#x27; Championship by five points, while Benetton moved back into the lead of the Constructors&#x27; Championship by two points from Williams.

In the second Sauber, Andrea de Cesaris made his 208th and final Grand Prix start, at the time second only to Riccardo Patrese. Karl Wendlinger was due to return to the Swiss team at the next race in Japan, following his crash at Monaco earlier in the season.

<text>The 1994 Japanese Grand Prix (officially the XX Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 6 November 1994 at the Suzuka Circuit, Suzuka. It was the fifteenth and penultimate race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship. In wet conditions, the 50-lap race was won by Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from second position. Hill&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship rival Michael Schumacher finished second in his Benetton-Ford, having started from pole position, with Jean Alesi third in his Ferrari. The win left Hill just one point behind Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with one race remaining. This also proved to be the last Grand Prix for Érik Comas. This was also the last time in Formula 1 history when the race was split in two parts due to race stoppage and final classification has been set by aggregate time.

==Report==
Going into the race, Benetton driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 86 points, five ahead of rival Damon Hill in the Williams on 81. Schumacher felt he was &quot;very confident&quot; about the race, and Hill similarly declared that he was &quot;positive&quot;.

There were several changes of driver for this race: Johnny Herbert moved from Ligier to Benetton after just one race for the French team, replacing Jos Verstappen. His place at Ligier was taken by Franck Lagorce. Eric Bernard lost his seat at Lotus to Mika Salo who had been racing in Japanese Formula 3000, and likewise Simtek hired Taki Inoue on a one-race deal, replacing Domenico Schiattarella. Finally, JJ Lehto returned to Sauber to replace Andrea de Cesaris after the Italian&#x27;s sudden retirement from Formula One.

The race started in torrential rain, and as a result, several cars spun out of the race by aquaplaning, including Schumacher&#x27;s team-mate Herbert on lap 4, Lagorce, the Minardis of Pierluigi Martini and Michele Alboreto, and all three Japanese drivers by the end of lap 3 (with both Ukyo Katayama and Hideki Noda being injured in separate crashes). Lehto also retired at the start with an engine failure. As did Gerhard Berger in the second Ferrari with battery problems by lap 11.

On lap 13, Gianni Morbidelli crashed his Footwork at one of the Esses at the first sector. Shortly afterwards, Martin Brundle spun his McLaren off the track and crashed at the same spot, and as he bounced off the tyre barriers, hit a track marshal who was moving Morbidelli&#x27;s car off the gravel trap. The marshal suffered a broken leg, adding to the huge list of injuries of the 1994 season, and the race was immediately stopped, as both Brundle and Morbidelli were fortunately able to escape uninjured. Rubens Barrichello soon retired in the pits with transmission problems by lap 17, Blundell was also forced to retire from 10th position when his engine failed on lap 27, which ended an appalling weekend for Tyrrell. This left 13 runners, and there were no further retirements for the remaining 23 laps.

As the rain eased, it was decided to run the remainder of the race, with around one hour to the time limit, on aggregate corrected time. Schumacher had been leading by 6.8 seconds when the red flag was shown, but Hill had a bigger lead (10.1 seconds) at the chequered flag, and thus took the win by 3.3 seconds on aggregate. This remains the last instance of aggregate race time being used in Formula One to determine the winner.

<text>The 1994 Australian Grand Prix (formally the LIX Adelaide Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 13 November 1994 at the Adelaide Street Circuit. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 1994 Formula One World Championship. The 81-lap race was won by Nigel Mansell driving for the Williams team after starting from pole position. , this is the last time a Formula One driver won a race over the age of 40. Gerhard Berger finished second in a Ferrari car with Martin Brundle third for the McLaren team.

The race is remembered, besides being the closing of one of the most tragic seasons in the history of the category, also for an incident involving the two title contenders Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher which forced both to retire and resulted in Schumacher winning the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Also notable was the last appearance in a Formula One Grand Prix of the first incarnation of Team Lotus, previously seven-time Constructors&#x27; Champions. It was also the 31st and last Grand Prix victory of Nigel Mansell&#x27;s Formula One career, as well as his last podium finish in his last race for Williams. , this was the last Formula One race where the number of entrants exceeded the number of places on the starting grid. This would also prove to be the last Grand Prix for Christian Fittipaldi, Franck Lagorce, Michele Alboreto, Hideki Noda, David Brabham, JJ Lehto, Paul Belmondo and the Larrousse team.

==Report==

===Background===
Heading into the final race of the season, Benetton driver Michael Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 92 points; Williams driver Damon Hill was second on 91 points, one point behind Schumacher. Williams led the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 108 points, while Benetton were 5 points behind with 103. Thus, both titles were still at stake, and they would be determined in the final round.

===Race===
Schumacher took the lead at the start, with Hill second behind him. The order between the two remained the same until lap 36. Hill was catching Schumacher when the Benetton driver went off the track at the East Terrace corner, hitting a wall with his right side wheels before pulling back onto the track. Hill had rounded the fifth corner of the track when Schumacher pulled across the track ahead of him to the left. At the next corner, Hill attempted to pass Schumacher; the two collided when Schumacher turned in. Schumacher was eliminated on the spot. Hill attempted to continue the race and pitted immediately, but retired from the race with irreparable damage to the car&#x27;s front left suspension wishbone. As neither driver scored, Schumacher took the title.

After Schumacher and Hill retired, Nigel Mansell took the lead of the race. Mansell stayed in the lead until he made his second pit stop. After Mansell pitted, Berger took the lead and stayed in the lead after his second pit stop. On lap 64, Mansell overtook Berger to retake the lead of the race. Mika Häkkinen was running 5th in the closing stages behind teammate Brundle and Barrichello until his brakes failed on lap 77, sending him off into the wall backwards into retirement but was classified 12th. Mansell stayed in the lead for the rest of the race to win, with Berger finishing second and Brundle finishing third ahead of Barrichello, Panis, and Jean Alesi in the other Ferrari completing the top 6. This race marks the first time a driver over the age of 40 won a Formula One race since Jack Brabham in 1970. , Mansell remains the last driver to win a Formula One race over the age of 40.

===Post-race===
Schumacher was blamed for the incident by many Formula One insiders despite having won the Championship. After investigation, the race stewards judged it as a racing incident and took no action against Schumacher. At age 25, Schumacher was Germany&#x27;s first Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion (given that Jochen Rindt, posthumous 1970 World&#x27;s Champion, competed for Austria, his adoptive country), albeit under highly controversial circumstances. Schumacher always maintained that the collision was a racing incident, a view that met with a large degree of media cynicism, particularly in the United Kingdom. Schumacher has been blamed by the United Kingdom public for the incident. In 2003, the BBC conducted a search for &quot;The Most Unsporting Moment&quot; in which the Adelaide incident was nominated. Hill&#x27;s 1994 season earned him the 1994 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Although Hill deliberately avoided becoming involved in the outcry at the time, in later years he explicitly accused Schumacher of deliberately driving into him. Formula One commentator Murray Walker maintained that Schumacher did not cause the crash intentionally while his co-commentators for the race, former Formula One driver Jonathan Palmer and pit reporter Barry Sheene, both argued that the crash was entirely Schumacher&#x27;s fault. Patrick Head of the Williams team stated to &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine that in 1994 &quot;Williams were already 100% certain that Michael was guilty of foul play&quot; but did not protest Schumacher&#x27;s title because the team was still dealing with the death of Ayrton Senna, to whom Schumacher dedicated his title after his death in the San Marino Grand Prix earlier in the year.

<doc id="1123234" wikidata="Q54417" url="?curid=1123234" title="1995 Brazilian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 1995 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the first round of the 1995 Formula One World Championship. Michael Schumacher of the Benetton team won the 71-lap race from second position. David Coulthard finished second in a Williams car, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Damon Hill, who started the race from pole position, spun out while leading on lap 30 with an apparent gearbox problem, which was later found to be a suspension failure. Schumacher&#x27;s win came despite Benetton encountering steering problems with his car during Friday practice, leading to him crashing heavily and necessitating steering component changes for the rest of the event. Despite Schumacher&#x27;s victory, Hill proved to be faster during the race and seemed to be on course for a comfortable victory before his sudden retirement.

Other notable performances came from Berger, who took the final podium position despite being delayed during one of his routine pit stops due to a problem with a loose wheel nut, from Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing, and from Mika Salo, who drove strongly in the first half of the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and drop back to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car&#x27;s initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.

Several hours after the conclusion of the race, Schumacher and Coulthard were from the race result as the chemical &quot;fingerprint&quot; of fuel samples from their cars taken after qualifying and the race did not match the specified sample lodged with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) prior to the event. Berger was thus declared the winner, but the race stewards&#x27; decision to exclude them was overturned at an appeal hearing on April 13. Schumacher and Coulthard were reinstated in first and second places respectively, but the two teams did not receive their respective constructors&#x27; points. The Ferrari team was unhappy with the decision made at the appeal hearing; Berger called the sport &quot;a joke&quot;. The rule concerning the legality of fuels had been changed for the 1995 season, as had the new standardised equipment used for refuelling during the race, the drivers&#x27; weighing-in procedure and the conditions of the drivers&#x27; racing licences; all of these changes produced controversies which at times threatened to overshadow the race, as did the excessively bumpy condition of the track. The race also marked the first Brazilian Grand Prix to take place since the death of Brazilian triple World Champion Ayrton Senna the previous year; his death was commemorated in various ways throughout the event.

==Background==

The race was the first round of the 1995 Formula One World Championship after a four month break since the last race of the 1994 season in Australia. Over the winter months, the Autódromo José Carlos Pace race track was resurfaced in an attempt to reduce its bumpiness. The drivers were unhappy with the resurfacing work, though, as the track became more bumpy than in the previous year. Williams driver David Coulthard described the track as &quot;bumpy as hell, quite unbelievable&quot;. He was also concerned about his stamina for the duration of the 71-lap race, as he had suffered from a bout of tonsillitis in the run-up to the event which had disrupted his physical training. Local Jordan driver Rubens Barrichello was even more vocal in his criticism of the track&#x27;s condition, declaring that the circuit organisers were &quot;a bunch of idiots. The track is three times bumpier than before. It is not by applying layer upon layer of tarmac that they will improve matters.&quot; Heinz-Harald Frentzen claimed that the bumping was so bad that he was close to passing out; the Sauber car handled badly over the bumps throughout the weekend.

The race marked the first Brazilian Grand Prix to be held since the death of three-time champion Ayrton Senna the previous year in a racing accident at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. As such, various tributes were paid to him throughout the weekend, including a parade lap on the back of a truck with all the drivers waving Brazilian flags; a display from the Brazilian Air Force which resulted in a large &quot;S&quot; trail in the sky; and the renaming of a local highway to &quot;Rodovia Ayrton Senna&quot;. The São Paulo city authorities had planned to rename the circuit after Senna, but the family of Carlos Pace, the existing dedicatee, objected. Barrichello also sported a special helmet design as a personal tribute to his compatriot. As a result of Senna&#x27;s death, the event was lower-key than in recent years: fewer spectators turned out to watch practice and qualifying, but the race itself was watched by a capacity crowd.

The threat of a drivers&#x27; boycott over the terms of their 1995 FIA Super Licences, which allowed the FIA to demand promotional appearances and forbade the drivers from criticising the championship, was defused by the governing body prior to the race, ensuring full driver participation in the championship. Although the Super License issue was resolved with 14 teams and 28 drivers on the official 1995 entry list, the Larrousse team with drivers Éric Bernard and Christophe Bouchut did not make an appearance at the circuit for any of the on-track sessions. This was due to the team running short of money: in the period prior to the event, with French government aid not forthcoming and a 1995 chassis not yet built, team owner Gérard Larrousse elected to miss the first two rounds of the season in the hope of competing from the onwards.

The construction of some of the cars was only just completed prior to the beginning of the season; the Footwork FA16 and Simtek S951 chassis arrived at the event with virtually no testing, having been completed shortly beforehand. Of the initial 1995 drivers, Pedro Diniz was the only &quot;complete&quot; , having not been officially entered in any other Formula One race meetings, while Andrea Montermini started his first race after failing to qualify for the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix due to injury. Mika Salo and Domenico Schiattarella had competed in two races, with Taki Inoue competing in one race the previous season.

At the front of the field, Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill in the Benetton and Williams cars respectively were the favourites to battle for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with Schumacher anticipating a &quot;struggle&quot; for the championship. Bernard Dudot, Renault Sport&#x27;s Chief Engineer, said that he believed Benetton was less well-prepared than Williams, as the former team had changed its engine supplier to Renault, whereas Williams had been in partnership with the company since . Hill arrived at the event with the psychological advantage of having set the fastest time at the final pre-season testing session at the Autódromo do Estoril, 0.35 seconds faster than Schumacher&#x27;s best around the circuit. The Williams team had also completed 2,500 miles of testing with its FW17 chassis, significantly more than Benetton; the team had encountered some reliability problems with its own B195 chassis.

Heading into the new season, attention also focused on the McLaren team and its driver Nigel Mansell. He was initially announced as the partner of Mika Häkkinen; however, a week before the first race, McLaren announced that Mansell would not compete in the first two races of the new season, as he could not fit into the MP4/10 car. Mansell&#x27;s arrival at McLaren was due to demand from the team&#x27;s sponsors, including Philip Morris, whose brand, Marlboro, was on the car, who wanted to enjoy the publicity associated with the World Champion&#x27;s return even if it meant him performing worse than teammate Häkkinen. His place at McLaren for the first two races was taken by the team&#x27;s test driver, Mark Blundell, as McLaren worked to build a wider monocoque to accommodate Mansell. McLaren were also concerned about the standard refuelling equipment provided for 1995 by suppliers Intertechnique, having suffered a major leak in a test of the new rig outside of its factory. Intertechnique had redesigned the fuel equipment, which was used by all of the teams, in the wake of a pit lane fire suffered by driver Jos Verstappen during the previous year&#x27;s . The new fuel rigs, in addition to being half the size of the 1994, also featured longer nozzles, and were designed to lock onto the car before any fuel could begin to flow. Intertechnique traced the problem to a faulty valve within the equipment, which caused of fuel to leak, and modified the parts accordingly. Intertechnique and the FIA advised the teams to refuel the cars slowly and carefully during pitstops to avoid any further leaks, a situation that was considered unsatisfactory by many of the team principals and mechanics. A new regulation for 1995 also mandated the teams&#x27; fuel suppliers to send samples of their fuel to the FIA prior to each Grand Prix, which the governing body would use as a reference when conducting fuel tests at the event itself. Thus only fuel approved by the FIA in advance was allowed; any deviations from the samples on file was not permitted. As before, all cars were subject to routine fuel tests as part of the scrutineering process throughout the weekend to ensure compliance with the sport&#x27;s technical regulations. The rule change had been proposed by the Elf oil company in 1993 and unanimously supported by the other F1 suppliers in order to speed up the fuel-testing process.

Controversy also surrounded the new Ligier JS41 car, with rival team owners comparing it to the Benetton B195 car because of their similar design, the only apparent difference being the engine in each car. The Ligier team was being run in 1995 by Tom Walkinshaw, who had been Benetton&#x27;s Engineering Director the previous season. Commenting on the design similarities, Walkinshaw said:

One of the rule revisions stated that the minimum weight limit of applied to both car and driver together. Prior to the first session of the season, all of the drivers were weighed to establish a reference weight to be used on occasions when the two were weighed separately, or if the driver was unavailable to be weighed. As such, a small competitive advantage could be established if the driver attempted to register a weight as heavy as possible, so their actual weight when driving the car would be lower. Williams Technical Director Patrick Head estimated that a weight penalty of could cost 14 seconds over the course of 70 laps of the circuit. In the drivers&#x27; weigh-in, Schumacher weighed in at , compared to at the beginning of the 1994 season. Sauber driver Karl Wendlinger gained the most weight compared to 1994, gaining . Wendlinger&#x27;s teammate Frentzen and Tyrrell driver Ukyo Katayama added the least amount of weight, gaining . When Schumacher was weighed after the race, his weight had decreased to , although this weight, when combined with that of his car, still left it above the limit, at . Schumacher explained the weight gain as a consequence of a fitness regime over the winter that had converted excess fat to muscle, and also admitted to eating and drinking heavily, in addition to refraining from using the toilet, prior to the weigh-in.

==Practice and qualifying==
Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning, with the second held on Saturday morning. Both were held in damp conditions due to overnight rain with the track drying towards the conclusion of the respective sessions. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes. Qualifying was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon. The fastest time from either of the two qualifying sessions counted towards their final grid position.

In the first practice session, Hill was fastest with a time of 1:21.664, two thousands of a second ahead of teammate Coulthard. Schumacher was third, with the Ferrari cars of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, who had been the leading two for most of the session, close behind. Blundell in the McLaren was sixth, with teammate Häkkinen finishing the session in 14th position, the Finnish driver complaining of steering problems with the car. The two Ferrari drivers used different pedal layouts in the 412T2 chassis: Berger&#x27;s car was equipped with two pedals and a hand-operated clutch, whereas Alesi preferred the traditional three-pedal system.

Hill set a provisional pole position time of 1:20.081 during the first qualifying session, ahead of Berger, Coulthard, Alesi, Häkkinen and Schumacher. The session was disrupted after Schumacher crashed heavily into the tyre barrier at turn eight, a corner normally taken at a speed of . As a precaution, Benetton opted to keep Schumacher&#x27;s teammate, Johnny Herbert, in the garage while the team found out what was wrong with the car. This meant that Herbert did not set a time in the session, while Schumacher completed only two of his twelve allotted laps. Speaking of the incident, Schumacher said that &quot;there was a little movement in the steering wheel at the previous corner and at the next it went completely. I spun the car backwards into the tyre barrier and the safety structure behind my head did a good job of protecting me. For sure I am not very happy about this, but I believe that the team will spend a lot of time investigating the situation for tomorrow and they will find the problem.&quot; The problem was determined to be a steering failure, specifically a joint in the car&#x27;s steering column. Replacement steering components were sourced from São Paulo by Benetton engineer Tim Wright, and the team did not encounter any problems over the remainder of the weekend.

The second practice session was held in wet but drying weather conditions. During the session, Schumacher went off the track at the exit of turn five, damaging his car&#x27;s front wing in the process. However, he still set the fastest time of the session (1:23.607) after a change to his car&#x27;s ride height proved beneficial to its performance. The top six was completed by Berger, Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, and Olivier Panis&#x27; Ligier.

Schumacher also set the fastest time in the second qualifying session with a lap of 1:20.382, but it was not good enough to beat Hill&#x27;s fastest time overall set in the first session. Hill made a set-up change that he turned out not to be happy with, but maintained his pole position, his first since the 1994 British Grand Prix. The Williams and Benetton formation continued on the second row, as Coulthard was third, with Herbert qualifying fourth after a late flying lap, equalling his best-ever qualifying position, achieved at the 1994 Italian Grand Prix for the Lotus team. However, a hole was punched in the bottom of Herbert&#x27;s monocoque chassis during the session as a result of damage, leading to a night of repairs in order for him to be able to take the start in his designated race car. The work required to repair both Benetton cars caused Schumacher&#x27;s race engineer, Pat Symonds, to describe the weekend as &quot;one of the hardest [...] I can remember for many years&quot;. It also meant that three British drivers started in the top four, leading Hill to joke that &quot;the English [sic] have got Michael surrounded&quot;. Behind the leading four, the two Ferrari cars were fifth and sixth, Berger qualifying in front of Alesi. Both were optimistic on their race prospects, despite the fact that the former suffered an engine failure during the session. The two McLaren cars of Häkkinen and Blundell were seventh and ninth, the two split by Eddie Irvine in a Jordan car. Irvine set his time despite spinning off during the session; his teammate Barrichello suffered the season&#x27;s first engine failure during a timed session on Friday and then gearbox problems on Saturday, before also spinning off during that day&#x27;s qualifying session, restricting him to a disappointing 16th position on the grid at his home race. Katayama and Salo proved evenly-matched for Tyrrell, qualifying in 11th and 12th respectively, behind Panis. The Minardi drivers were also close, with Pierluigi Martini and Luca Badoer taking 17th and 18th positions on the grid respectively, separated from the Tyrrell drivers by Gianni Morbidelli (Footwork), Frentzen, Aguri Suzuki (Ligier) and Barrichello. Wendlinger took 19th position, the Sauber cars handling particularly badly on the bumpy track, ahead of Bertrand Gachot and Montermini (both Pacific drivers), who sandwiched Inoue in the second Footwork. At the back of the grid, the two Forti and Simtek cars covered positions 23 to 26. Schiattarella, in a Simtek, was last out of the four positions, having caused one of the two red flags in qualifying, crashing on the exit of turn three at the beginning of the second qualifying session. The Simtek team&#x27;s testing time was limited on Friday as the mandatory onboard fire extinguishers for its cars failed to arrive in time; a similar problem with the late arrival of parts affecting Martini&#x27;s Minardi. The times in the second session were generally quicker, with only Hill, Badoer and Wendlinger setting their quickest lap times during the first session.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The conditions for the race were dry, with a capacity crowd of some 40,000 fans turning out to watch the race. The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest with teammate Hill in second. Schumacher completed the top three positions. Herbert and Katayama both suffered from gearbox problems with their race cars, and elected to start the race with their teams&#x27; spare cars. The Simtek team did not take part in the session, as both drivers waited for stronger suspension components flown out from the United Kingdom to be fitted to the cars for the race. Minutes before the race started, a press release from the FIA was given to all media and team personnel, notifying them that the chromatographic analysis of the Elf fuel samples taken from Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton and the Coulthard&#x27;s Williams during qualifying did not match the sample provided by the fuel company before the start of the season for reference purposes, thus rendering both cars illegal. Both teams were fined $30,000 and raced under appeal, as the standard penalty for the offence was disqualification from the event. Neither Schumacher nor Coulthard were informed of the situation, as the teams did not want to unsettle their drivers before the race start. Hill and Herbert&#x27;s races were not affected by the judgement, despite using the same type of fuel. Samples from Ferrari&#x27;s Agip and McLaren&#x27;s Mobil fuel were also tested; both were in accordance with the regulations. Though 26 cars qualified for the race, only 25 took the start: Martini retired on the parade lap, his Minardi car suffering a gearbox problem.

==Race==

Hill had a bad start from pole position, allowing Schumacher to overtake him into turn one. Panis, who started from tenth position in a Ligier, spun at the first corner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting the wall in the process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lap one, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At the end of the first lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lap three, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turn five, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turn six. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lap five, Herbert had dropped down to tenth position, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lap ten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12th position with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lap fifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourth corner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine&#x27;s teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.

The Benetton and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Benetton team were planning a three stop strategy whereas the Williams team were only planning for two stops. Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 18, but was momentarily baulked by the slowing Jordan car of Barrichello as he was entering the pitlane. Schumacher exited the stop behind Berger, but overtook the Austrian driver at the beginning of the next lap. Hill, who had remained close behind Schumacher before the German made a pit stop, made his own stop on lap 21, exiting the pitlane in front of Schumacher. Coulthard took the lead of the race for one lap, before pitting and dropping behind the two leaders and the yet-to-stop Häkkinen and Berger. Häkkinen and Berger were the final drivers of the leading teams to pit, however, the McLaren mechanics had trouble getting the fuel hose off the Finn&#x27;s car when he stopped on lap 23, losing him ten seconds. Several other teams experienced problems with attaching and detaching the refuelling nozzles, and occasional small sprays of fuel were observed, reinforcing the problem experienced by McLaren with the equipment before the race meeting. Berger, adopting a strategy of pitting late, was the only driver not to have stopped by lap 24 and thus was third, with Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi and Salo the other drivers in the top six places. Salo&#x27;s stop had been faultless, gaining him significant time on those drivers who had been running in front of him. By this stage Gachot had retired his Pacific car after it got stuck in fifth gear. Berger made his stop on lap 27, but had problems leaving the pit lane after a communication problem between him and his mechanics nearly led to him leaving the pit lane with a loose wheel nut on the front right-hand wheel. The pit &quot;lollipop&quot;, signalling the driver when to leave, was raised and lowered again in quick succession, preventing Berger from leaving until the wheel nut was sufficiently tightened. The miscommunication cost Berger 13 seconds, dropping him back to seventh position. Alesi fell behind Salo and Häkkinen after the first set of pit stops, Salo overtaking him on lap 25, with Häkkinen moving past three laps later as Alesi was held up behind the lapped Montermini.

Once in front of Schumacher, Hill was able to gradually extend his lead to 3.4 seconds by lap 30 despite carrying a heavier fuel load for one fewer planned pit stop. However, he lost second gear during the course of that lap, and then spun off at turn two on lap 31, retiring from the race with a suspected gearbox seizure. On the same lap, Herbert also retired from the race after suffering damage in a collision with Suzuki, who himself had to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace his car&#x27;s damaged nosecone. Schumacher thus assumed the lead as a result of Hill&#x27;s retirement, leading by 11.5 seconds from Coulthard. Salo was third in the remaining Tyrrell, 39.4 seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars completed the top six positions. Schumacher made his second pit stop on lap 37, exiting in second position behind Coulthard. Salo and Häkkinen, both performing much better than had been expected prior to the race, battled over third position until lap 39, when Salo, suffering from cramp and driving with one hand, spun at the final bend. He made a pit stop soon after for fresh tyres, dropping to eighth position. Häkkinen, having moved up to third, made his second stop on lap 43, exiting behind the two Ferrari cars, Berger moving in front of Alesi as the latter made his stop on the following lap, rejoining in seventh. Coulthard made a pit stop from the lead on lap 47, the gap between him and Schumacher not big enough to allow him to maintain the lead. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race, 1:30.921, extending his lead to such an extent that when he made his own final stop on lap 52, he maintained the lead. After his final stop, Schumacher gradually opened his leading margin 11 seconds, winning the race after 71 laps in a time of 1:48:49.972s, with Coulthard finishing second in his Williams. The Ferrari cars of Berger – who made his final stop on lap 49 without losing a place – and Alesi were third and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Häkkinen, despite losing part of his rear wing after his car was struck by a bird, split them both to take fourth position. In the closing stages, Morbidelli and Blundell both overtook Salo, only for the Footwork driver to retire on lap 62 with a blocked fuel line. Blundell, who had earlier changed his steering wheel and was driving without the use of third gear, thus took the final point in sixth place, ahead of Salo, Suzuki, Montermini – who completed the race distance despite struggling with a broken floor on his chassis, taking the Pacific team&#x27;s first race finish – and Diniz. The race saw a high attrition rate; only ten out of the 25 starters finished the race. Of the other late retirements, Wendlinger suffered a broken battery cable on lap 41, Roberto Moreno and Badoer retired on lap 47 due to a spin and gearbox problem respectively, and Inoue&#x27;s car caught fire on lap 48. The Japanese driver was in any case due to receive the black flag for receiving an illegal push-start from the marshals following a spin on the circuit.

==Post-race==
Moments after his spin, Hill was interviewed by the BBC, revealing that his spin was due to a gearbox problem; the Williams car losing second gear before apparently seizing completely. Hill also said that he was &quot;very, very disappointed&quot; with the result, and that &quot;we could have beaten him [Schumacher] today&quot;. Further post-race analysis conducted by the Williams team, however, found that the problem was actually a broken left-rear suspension pushrod.

Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that &quot;Damon was a little bit quicker than me...he ended up going off and that&#x27;s racing, but I don&#x27;t think I could have caught him.&quot; He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello&#x27;s slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t able to match Michael and Damon&#x27;s pace so I settled for running my own race&quot;. Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that &quot;He was faster everywhere: down the straights, going in and out of the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car&#x27;s roadholding is not bad. We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that&#x27;s something.&quot;

After the Grand Prix, Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton and Coulthard&#x27;s Williams cars were from the race classification as a result of the illegal fuel sample &quot;fingerprints&quot;, and Berger declared the new victor. Further samples of both cars&#x27; fuel were taken after the race; these also did not match the specified sample. Patrick Head was surprised by this outcome as he believed that &quot;there was no question of disqualification until the fuel samples had been returned to Europe for further analysis&quot;. In addition to Benetton and Williams, fuel samples were taken from the Ferrari (Agip) and McLaren (Mobil) cars during the event, all of which were declared legal after FIA analysis. After an appeal was made by the two teams, the drivers were reinstated into the race classification at the hearing on April 13 (after the had taken place); however, the teams did not receive Constructors&#x27; points. The two teams were fined a further $200,000 during the hearing. It was generally agreed that the illegal fuel did not offer a performance advantage or break any of the regulations relating to chemical composition, only that it did not precisely match the sample that had previously been lodged with the FIA. Niki Lauda, an advisor to Ferrari, was not happy with the decision made at the appeal:

Berger also commented on the situation, saying &quot;I no longer understand anything. Formula One has become a joke.&quot; In the lead-up to the San Marino Grand Prix, Schumacher was quoted saying that Berger should &quot;concentrate on racing instead of thinking how he can criticise me. I have never understood how someone can celebrate a victory like that [Brazil] one lap down and winning after someone else has been disqualified.&quot; Berger responded to Schumacher&#x27;s comments by saying:

Max Mosley, the president of the FIA, also responded to Schumacher&#x27;s comments saying that his comments &quot;reflect poorly on the sport and show a lack of adult attitude&quot;. Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that &quot;it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn&#x27;t go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn&#x27;t take care that it didn&#x27;t happen&quot;. Elf was also unhappy with the way in which the episode had been handled, the company&#x27;s Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that &quot;We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us.&quot; Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.

<text>The 1995 Argentine Grand Prix (formally the XVIII Gran Premio Marlboro de la Republica Argentina) was a Formula One motor race held on 9 April 1995 at the Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was the second race of the 1995 Formula One World Championship and the first running of the Argentine Grand Prix since .

The 72-lap race was won by Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, after starting from second position. Jean Alesi was second in a Ferrari, with Michael Schumacher third in a Benetton-Renault. Hill&#x27;s teammate, David Coulthard, took the first pole position of his F1 career before retiring with an electrical failure.

==Report==
===Background===
This was the first running of the Argentine Grand Prix since . The race had been removed from the Formula One calendar due to the retirement of Carlos Reutemann and Argentina&#x27;s invasion of the Falkland Islands, before being reinstated following President Carlos Menem&#x27;s rise to power in 1989 and the subsequent modernisation of the Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez.

The No. 6 configuration of the circuit was to be used - the race having previously used the No. 2 and No. 9 configurations, as well as the long and fast No. 15 configuration. To celebrate the race&#x27;s return, Reutemann drove a demonstration lap of the circuit aboard the Ferrari 412 T1 on the Thursday afternoon before the race. The track, however, was criticised due to its &quot;dirtiness&quot;.

In the two weeks between the Brazilian and Argentine Grands Prix, the FIA rescinded the rule requiring that holes be cut in the airboxes; consequently, all the cars arrived at the circuit with their airbox holes filled.

===Practice and qualifying===
As the No. 6 configuration of the circuit was new to the Formula One calendar, a familiarisation session was held on the Thursday. The first practice session proper was held on Friday morning, followed in the afternoon by the first one-hour qualifying session. On Saturday, the second practice session was held, followed by the second qualifying session.

Both qualifying session took place in wet conditions, with several drivers spinning; only towards the end of the Saturday session did the conditions improve. David Coulthard took the first pole position of his F1 career, with a time of 1:53.241 in his Williams. Teammate Damon Hill was alongside him on the front row of the grid, despite his time being 0.8 seconds slower, with Michael Schumacher third in the Benetton. Eddie Irvine took fourth in the Jordan, followed by Mika Häkkinen in the McLaren, Jean Alesi in the Ferrari, and Mika Salo in the Tyrrell. The top ten was completed by Gerhard Berger in the second Ferrari, Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the Sauber and Rubens Barrichello in the second Jordan. The Simteks impressed with Jos Verstappen taking 14th, ahead of Mark Blundell in the second McLaren and both Ligiers, and Domenico Schiattarella 20th.

===Race===
In dry conditions and with President Menem in attendance, Coulthard led away while, behind him, Alesi spun on the inside of the first corner. Salo, braking to avoid Alesi, was hit from behind by Luca Badoer&#x27;s Minardi, causing him to run into the side of the second Benetton of Johnny Herbert. In turn, Herbert hit Barrichello, as did Badoer, with the second Tyrrell of Ukyo Katayama also becoming involved. Behind them, Olivier Panis in the Ligier hit the back of Pierluigi Martini in the second Minardi. The race was red-flagged, and Alesi, Herbert, Barrichello, Katayama, Panis and Martini returned to the pits to take their teams&#x27; respective spare cars for the restart (meaning Badoer&#x27;s weekend was over), while Salo&#x27;s car was repaired on the grid.

On the second formation lap, Karl Wendlinger stalled his Sauber and was forced to start at the back of the grid. Coulthard again led away, while behind him there were more collisions: Häkkinen trod on Irvine&#x27;s front wing on the run down to the first corner and retired immediately, while Wendlinger tangled with both Pacifics, putting all three out. Irvine made it back to the pits for a replacement nose, but retired on lap 7 when his engine failed.

Coulthard led until lap 6 when his throttle failed and restarted, allowing Schumacher and Hill past. Hill overtook Schumacher on lap 11 and led until making his first pit stop on lap 16. The recovering Coulthard passed Schumacher to take back the lead, only for his throttle to fail permanently almost immediately after. When Schumacher made his first stop, Alesi inherited the lead and held it for eight laps, before pitting himself. Behind them, Verstappen moved up to sixth in his Simtek, before suffering a long pit stop followed by a gearbox failure on lap 24.

After his stop, Alesi was nearly half a minute behind Hill, but ahead of Schumacher. Hill retained the lead for the rest of the race, though Alesi closed the gap to 6.4 seconds by the chequered flag. Despite setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 55, Schumacher finished 27 seconds behind Alesi, with teammate Herbert fourth. Salo was running fifth, close behind Herbert, when he collided with Aguri Suzuki in the second Ligier on lap 48; he angrily confronted the Japanese driver in the pit lane before telling the BBC that &quot;drivers like Suzuki should not be in Formula One&quot;. Fifth thus went to Frentzen, with Berger picking up the final point for sixth. Following Verstappen&#x27;s retirement, Schiattarella finished ninth to equal Simtek&#x27;s best-ever result.

Berger&#x27;s point kept him in the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship, pending the appeals to Schumacher and Coulthard&#x27;s disqualifications from the Brazilian Grand Prix.

===Post-race===
Four days after the race, the FIA International Court of Appeal overturned the disqualifications from Brazil, meaning that Schumacher led the Drivers&#x27; Championship by four points from Hill with Berger dropping to fifth.

Meanwhile, in response to the criticism, the track was resurfaced over the winter of 1995–96, ready for the 1996 running of the race.

<text>The 1995 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 30 April 1995 at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, Imola. It was the third race of the 1995 Formula One season.

Following the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at Imola the previous year, the track was heavily modified for 1995. New chicanes were built at Tamburello and Villeneuve corners, Acque Minerali chicane was removed and replaced by a right-hand corner, Rivazza was eased and the final corner became a single chicane, rather than the 5th-gear sweep previously.

Williams-Renault driver Damon Hill scored an emotional victory at the track at which his teammate Senna died a year earlier, while the Ferraris of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger finished second and third respectively. Despite being teammates from 1993 to 1997, this was the only occasion Alesi and Berger shared a podium racing for the same team.

== Race report ==
Michael Schumacher secured pole position with his time on Friday, in an exciting qualifying session. David Coulthard had looked to have set the fastest time on Friday but it only lasted for a few seconds before it was snatched back by Schumacher. Moments later Gerhard Berger - who was on a stupendously fast lap in his Ferrari - screamed towards the start-finish line and looked set to send the local Ferrari fans into raptures. Berger came agonisingly close to securing pole position and a mere 0.008 seconds separated the Austrian&#x27;s Ferrari from Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton.

Berger&#x27;s performance guaranteed massive crowds for the rest of the weekend but on Saturday the weather was hotter and the track a lot slower. None of the fast men improved. Nigel Mansell, making his return to F1 with McLaren, qualified ninth, three places down on teammate Häkkinen.

Before the race, all the drivers participated in a one-minute silence in the memory of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna who had died a year earlier at the same track.

The weather took a turn on race day and Sunday morning was greeted with steady rain but the rain did not deter the fans and the hillsides of Imola were packed with the joyful Ferrari fans from dawn onwards. As the grid lined up teams had to decide whether to race on slick tyres or on wets. Six drivers chose wet tyres: the first five on the grid and Rubens Barrichello in 10th place. By the end of the first lap the men on wet tyres were lying 1-2-3-4-5-6 and everyone else was waiting for the track to dry. The drivers on wets gained about five seconds a lap on their rivals. Then they started coming in. Schumacher&#x27;s race lasted only half a lap after his pit stop because, on the way up to the top of the circuit, the Benetton snapped suddenly to the right and hit the wall hard. It looked like a driver of a very sensitive car making a mistake on slicks in damp conditions, but Schumacher said it was a car problem.

With Schumacher out of the way Berger led Hill, Coulthard and Jean Alesi. The latter pair put on a good show, ducking and weaving as they dived through the backmarkers.

The fight became more significant when Berger&#x27;s Ferrari stalled during his next pit stop. This left Hill in the lead with Coulthard and Alesi on his tail. During the exciting pit stop sequence Coulthard and Alesi brushed but the Williams team did not spot a damaged front wing. An over-eager Coulthard exceeded the speed-limit when exiting the pits, resulting in the Williams driver receiving a 10-second penalty. Unfortunately for Coulthard the rules meant that the Williams team would be unable to change his now obviously damaged front wing when he returned to the pits to serve his penalty and so had to make a third trip to the pits to replace his damaged front wing, by which time his race was ruined. There was nearly disaster for Hill when a refuelling hose stuck during his final pit stop but he managed to get out ahead of Alesi.

In the midfield the returning Mansell collided with Eddie Irvine in the Jordan and both had to pit. The race ended up being 1992 champion Mansell&#x27;s last race finish.

Hill won, with Alesi and Berger coming second and third. Coulthard was fourth and Häkkinen fifth, the McLaren a lap down, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen gave Sauber another unexpected point by finishing sixth. The Ferrari fans and the team itself were left asking what might have been had Berger not stalled in the pits while he was involved in a titanic struggle with Hill.

<text>The 1995 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 14 May 1995 at the Circuit de Catalunya, Montmeló. It was the fourth race of the 1995 Formula One season. It proved to be the final race for 1992 Formula One champion Nigel Mansell, who quit the McLaren team after the race. Both Damon Hill and Rubens Barrichello experienced gearbox problems on the final lap, Hill dropping from 2nd (which would have kept him in the lead of the championship) to 4th, and Barrichello from 6th to 7th. This gave the Benetton team their second, and ultimately final, 1–2 finish. This race marked the last Grand Prix start of 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell who would leave the McLaren team after experiencing two difficult races when driving for the team.

==Summary==
The green light failed to illuminate at the start, leaving the start to be indicated only by the red lights being turned off. Michael Schumacher led from start to finish on a two stop strategy. His team mate Johnny Herbert left the pits with the rear jack attached to his car, while Bertrand Gachot suffered a small refuelling fire when pulling away from his second stop.

Mansell&#x27;s poor spell with the McLaren team came to an end when he retired the MP4/10 in the pits when already well down the order, complaining of poor handling. On the last lap Hill, lying second, suffered a hydraulic problem which saw him crawl across the line in fourth. This allowed Herbert to finish second, his best finish to date and his first ever podium finish. Barrichello had a similar problem losing sixth to Panis – both incidents were unseen by the TV coverage.

<text>The 1995 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the LIII Grand Prix de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held on 28 May 1995 at the Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monaco. It was the fifth round of the 1995 Formula One season. The 78-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after starting from second position. Damon Hill finished second for Williams after starting from pole position and leading the first 23 laps of the race, ahead of Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari car. The remaining points-scoring positions were filled by Johnny Herbert in the second Benetton, Mark Blundell (McLaren) and Heinz-Harald Frentzen (Sauber). Schumacher&#x27;s win was his third of the season thus far and extended his lead in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship over Hill to five points. It was also Renault&#x27;s first win in the Monaco Grand Prix, as Benetton&#x27;s engine supplier.

Schumacher won the race comfortably, over 30 seconds ahead of Hill. Hill&#x27;s speed advantage in qualifying, in which he had set a lap time almost one second faster than Schumacher, vanished in the race, enabling Schumacher to follow him closely from the start, despite carrying a heavier fuel load for a one-stop pit strategy, as opposed to Hill&#x27;s two. When Hill made his first pit stop, Schumacher took the lead, and stayed ahead of his rival for the remainder of the race. Hill also dropped behind the one-stopping Ferrari of Jean Alesi, but the latter crashed on lap 42 whilst attempting to avoid the lapped Ligier of Martin Brundle, who had spun in front of him. Hill&#x27;s Williams teammate, David Coulthard, retired from the race due to a gearbox failure after initially running in third place. In total, sixteen of the 26 entrants failed to finish, including both drivers for the Simtek team, which subsequently ran out of money and withdrew from the sport before the Canadian Grand Prix. The race was also marked by an accident at the first corner of the first lap involving Coulthard, Alesi and Berger, which caused the track to become blocked and the race to be restarted as a result.

==Report==

===Background===
Heading into the fifth race of the season, Benetton driver Michael Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 24 points, a single point ahead of Williams driver Damon Hill. The two Ferrari drivers, Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, lay third and fourth in the rankings with 14 and 13 points respectively, whilst David Coulthard and Johnny Herbert, in the second Williams and Benetton respectively, had scored 9 points each. Just four points separated these three teams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with Ferrari (27 points) leading Williams (26) and Benetton (23). After a trying start to the season, Schumacher had dominated the preceding Spanish Grand Prix, but both championships were open, with no strong favourite for the race victory.

There were two driver changes going into the event: McLaren driver Nigel Mansell was replaced by the team&#x27;s test driver, Mark Blundell, and Sauber driver Karl Wendlinger was replaced by Williams test driver and reigning International Formula 3000 champion Jean-Christophe Boullion. Mansell&#x27;s departure was the main talking point prior to the beginning of the race meeting, as it brought the World Champion&#x27;s troubled relationship with McLaren to an end after just two races with the team. Mansell had made a part-time return to Formula One in as a replacement for the late Ayrton Senna at Williams, but was passed over in favour of Coulthard for 1995 and opted to sign for McLaren instead. When he tested the MP4-10 chassis for the first time, it became apparent that it had a major handling imbalance, and, more seriously, that he did not fit comfortably in the cockpit. Mansell was thus forced to miss the opening two races of the season whilst the team built a wider monocoque to accommodate him. He competed in the San Marino and Spanish Grands Prix in the wider MP4-10B, but struggled to match the pace of teammate Mika Häkkinen and retired his otherwise healthy car from the latter race with handling problems. Mansell and team principal Ron Dennis subsequently agreed a mutual termination of their contract, and Blundell was restored to the seat that he had already occupied in the first two races. Blundell was employed on a race-by-race basis. The split marked the end of Mansell&#x27;s Formula One career. His presence was still strong at Monaco, however, as the official tickets and publicity material featured a prominent image of his McLaren.

Wendlinger had crashed heavily in practice for the previous year&#x27;s Monaco Grand Prix, sustaining a serious head injury from which it took the rest of the season for him to recover. Since rejoining Sauber at the beginning of the current season, he had struggled to match his pre-accident form, lapping several seconds per lap slower than teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen in the first four Grands Prix. Sauber released a statement clarifying that Wendlinger had not been sacked, and that he would still test for the team with a view to improving his performance. Boullion, who made his Formula One début as a result, was loaned to Sauber by Frank Williams, who was keen to use the known quantity of his test driver to evaluate Frentzen&#x27;s potential for a future race seat in his team. Frentzen was in his second season of Formula One, but this event also marked his first race start at Monaco, as Sauber had withdrawn him from the previous year&#x27;s race after Wendlinger&#x27;s accident.

The state of the Simtek team&#x27;s finances was also a major topic of interest. On the Thursday before the race weekend, team principal Nick Wirth held a press conference in which he admitted that the outfit faced imminent closure unless it received money that had been promised by various sponsors. Wirth admitted that Simtek faced a budget shortfall of several million dollars needed to complete the season, part of which was due to him being the victim of &quot;a broken deal&quot;. He also pledged to arrange a meeting of all Simtek&#x27;s financial backers over the race weekend in an attempt to raise additional capital, and that the team would not travel to the following Canadian Grand Prix, an expensive &quot;fly-away&quot; race, unless a rescue package was negotiated successfully. The team was already reduced to three gearboxes for the Monaco race meeting.

Due to the configuration of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Ferrari introduced a revised rear wing and diffuser design for the 412T2 chassis, allowing more space for downforce-generating winglets around the rear bodywork. The team also introduced two new suspension configurations, one used by Alesi and the other tested by Berger on his spare car. As was traditional at Monaco, Ferrari also brought an additional spare car, bringing the team&#x27;s total number of chassis to four. The Sauber team introduced new front and rear wings and a revised diffuser, in addition to a slightly lightened C14 chassis design. Benetton, Footwork and Tyrrell also added additional flaps and wings to the rear bodywork of their cars, whilst the latter team also applied its &quot;Hydrolink&quot; suspension design to the rear of the 023 for the first time. Lead Forti driver Pedro Diniz was given a new monocoque which weighed less than the first two FG01 tubs to have been built, and Minardi débuted a new exhaust system on its M195 to increase the power produced by the Ford engine.

===Practice and qualifying===
Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held from 09:30 to 11:15 local time on Thursday, and an identically timed session was also held on Saturday. Each driver was limited to 23 laps of free practice per day. The qualifying period was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon from 13:00 to 14:00 local time, with the second held on Saturday afternoon at the same time. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final grid position. Each driver was limited to twelve laps per qualifying session.

Alesi set the pace in Thursday free practice, which took place in bright and sunny weather conditions, with a time of 1:25.457. Schumacher and Hill were second and third, separated from their teammates by the two improved McLarens, with Häkkinen ahead of the returning Blundell. Berger was over two seconds slower than Alesi with the ninth-fastest lap time. Schumacher was unhappy with the handling of his car, and so the rear end of the B195 was stripped down for a precautionary check before qualifying. Further back, Frentzen set the eighteenth-fastest time after his Sauber shed its engine cover during the session. Boullion fared even worse, as he crashed at the Nouvelle Chicane in a manner reminiscent of Wendlinger&#x27;s accident the year before, but he was unhurt. Simtek&#x27;s shortage of gearboxes was also apparent: lead driver Jos Verstappen&#x27;s unit only allowed him to complete five laps before developing problems, but teammate Domenico Schiattarella set an encouraging 14th-fastest time.

Thursday qualifying was held in similar weather conditions to practice, but was interrupted by a brief shower of rain close to the end of the session. Alesi carried his form over from free practice, nudging the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him up on what he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2&#x27;s unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit as tight as Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger were putting into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12 laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixth place. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was still learning the track on his way to 11th, 2.8 seconds slower than Alesi&#x27;s best. Häkkinen continued McLaren&#x27;s promising form with a provisional fifth place, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season. Blundell was back in eighth after crashing into the barriers in the closing minutes of the session.

Frentzen impressed by setting the seventh-fastest time in his first Monaco qualifying session, despite having to take to the escape road at the Nouvelle Chicane after encountering the rain shower whilst on a flying lap. After his morning accident, Boullion drove steadily to take a provisional 21st position, complaining of a dire lack of grip from the C14 chassis. Another Monaco rookie, Eddie Irvine, out-paced his more experienced Jordan teammate, Rubens Barrichello, as the pair set the ninth and 13th-fastest times respectively. They were split by Coulthard and the Ligier drivers, with Martin Brundle ahead of Olivier Panis, despite the former crashing at La Rascasse and removing his rear wing as the rain fell. Gianni Morbidelli, who took 14th place, was another driver to crash during the sudden change to wet conditions, as did Footwork teammate Taki Inoue on his way to 24th position. Minardi drivers Luca Badoer and Pierluigi Martini occupied the provisional eighth row of the grid, just ahead of Tyrrell teammates Mika Salo and Ukyo Katayama, both of whom complained of poor handling over the bumps and understeer, despite the expected benefits of the Hydrolink suspension.

Towards the back of the Thursday time sheet, Schiattarella and Verstappen shared the former&#x27;s chassis to set the 20th and 19th-fastest times respectively, as Verstappen&#x27;s gearbox was still refusing to run smoothly. Schiattarella spun at La Rascasse and attempted to execute a spin-turn at the blind entry to the corner, almost collecting Roberto Moreno&#x27;s Forti in the process; he was given a $20,000 fine, suspended for three races, for &quot;creating a very dangerous situation&quot;. Verstappen then took over the car and crashed it, restricting the Simtek team to a total of nine laps between its two drivers. Behind Boullion, Andrea Montermini (Pacific) set the 22nd-quickest time, ahead of Moreno, who had to share his car with Diniz after the latter&#x27;s gearbox failed, restricting him to 25th place, over four seconds slower than his teammate. Occupying the last spot on the provisional grid, Bertrand Gachot failed to set a time due to a sheared brake disc on his Pacific, which caused his left-rear wheel to fall off on his first out-lap, forcing him to abandon his car out on the circuit.

After taking Friday off – a feature of the event timetable unique to Monaco – the drivers returned to action on Saturday in bright and warm conditions. Hill set the pace with a time of 1:23.468, which was the fastest lap of the weekend thus far. He was almost 0.8 seconds ahead of Alesi, who in turn led Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger and Panis. Schumacher was back in seventh place after damaging his car&#x27;s suspension in a collision with Frentzen exiting Casino Square, restricting him to 11 laps only. Frentzen later crashed heavily after losing control under braking for Massenet, punching a hole in the Sauber&#x27;s monocoque in the process. Blundell also crashed his McLaren at La Rascasse, but the damage was easier to repair.

The main drama of the day occurred after the practice session had ended. Inoue had spun and stalled his Footwork, which was being towed back to the pit lane by a recovery vehicle when it was struck from behind by the Renault Clio safety car – which was being taken on quick demonstration laps of the circuit in the hands of rally driver Jean Ragnotti, with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s press delegate as passenger – in the middle of the Piscine complex. The impact was sufficient to overturn the Footwork and render it a write-off: the FA16 sustained severe rear-end damage to the engine and gearbox, whilst the tow rope, attached to the car&#x27;s crash structure behind the driver&#x27;s head, pulled the roll hoop from the chassis. Inoue, who still sitting in the cockpit with his helmet on but his seatbelts unfastened, sustained two impacts to the head, the severity of which was shown by the fact that a chunk had been taken out of his helmet. He was taken to The Princess Grace Hospital Centre for a brain scan and, although he was found to have sustained only a slight concussion, was not permitted to take part in the afternoon qualifying session as a precaution. The Footwork team principal, Jackie Oliver, was infuriated by the incident, and wrote an official letter of complaint to the Automobile Club de Monaco, the body responsible for organising the event. He said that Inoue would have been killed had he not been wearing his helmet, and questioned the organisation of the ACM and Ragnotti&#x27;s attitude: &quot;Why was Ragnotti out there? It&#x27;s just lack of discipline. I understand he had accomplished a couple of laps before at a million miles an hour with handbrake turns at the Loews hairpin. What was the purpose of him doing it? Was it to give officials a thrill?&quot; The stewards tacitly acknowledged that the incident was not Inoue&#x27;s fault by authorising him to use the team&#x27;s spare car for qualifying, but this was rendered academic by his non-participation in the session.

The afternoon&#x27;s final qualifying session took place in similar good weather conditions to the morning&#x27;s running. The Ligier drivers were the first to set quick times, and then the leading drivers began to complete their first runs: Schumacher took provisional pole position with a time of 1:23.139, set twenty minutes into the session, and Berger went 0.5 seconds to move up to third. Five minutes later, Hill lowered the benchmark to 1:23.294; Schumacher responded with a time of 1:22.742 eight minutes afterwards; and then Hill put pole position beyond the reach of anyone else after completing a lap in 1:22.115. Schumacher was unable to improve his time on his final run, and then Hill trimmed the pole time to 1:21.952 with his own last effort of the session. It was a dominant performance from the Williams team leader, who went fastest in each of the circuit&#x27;s three timing sectors, and set three distinct lap times which were all faster than Schumacher&#x27;s best. Whilst Hill was delighted with his performance, Schumacher found that his Benetton was more difficult to control, and he blamed the disruptive effect of his collision with Frentzen in the morning session for the 0.8 second gap between him and Hill.

Behind the two leading runners, Ferrari&#x27;s challenge for pole position faded during the final session. Alesi&#x27;s car ground to a halt on his first out-lap of the session after losing hydraulic pressure, and he had to share Berger&#x27;s chassis for the remainder of qualifying. This forced Berger to hurry through his planned programme, making three runs instead of four, before handing his car over to his teammate. The extensive adjustments required to tailor the car&#x27;s pedal system from Berger to Alesi&#x27;s preferred set-up meant that he left the pits with only two minutes and 38 seconds of the session remaining. Alesi thus had time for just one flying lap, which was spoiled when Irvine crashed his Jordan at Tabac during the final minutes. As a result, Alesi failed to improve on his Thursday time and dropped to fifth place on the grid, half a second and one position behind Berger. The team&#x27;s problems allowed Coulthard to improve to third place with a time of 1:23.109, continuing his progress as he became more familiar with the circuit. Häkkinen was another driver to be caught out by Irvine&#x27;s crash at the end of the session, restricting him to sixth place on the grid ahead of Herbert, who was satisfied to qualify only a second behind Schumacher. Blundell rounded out the top ten in the second McLaren, despite going up the escape road after missing his braking point at Sainte Dévote. Brundle took eighth and Irvine ninth despite his crash, which meant that all six of the British drivers qualified in the top ten.

Barrichello, outqualified by Irvine at every event thus far in 1995, set the 11th-fastest time, ahead of Panis – who complained of heavy traffic – and Morbidelli. Frentzen, like Alesi, was scheduled to take over his teammate&#x27;s car after his own proved too heavily damaged to repair, but the Sauber team&#x27;s programme was interrupted when Boullion crashed, also at Massanet. Frentzen thus failed to set a time and dropped to 14th on the grid, whilst Boullion had improved his time by three seconds before crashing, and took 19th place. They were split by the Tyrrell and Minardi drivers, in the order of Katayama, Badoer, Salo and Martini. Nearing the back of the grid, Schiattarella outqualified Verstappen for the first time by taking 20th position on the grid; Verstappen failed to improve on his Thursday time after another crash and further gearbox problems, and was restricted to 23rd. Gachot set the 21st-fastest time for Pacific, but on this occasion it was Montermini&#x27;s turn to not set a time as a result of his car suffering a gearbox failure; he dropped to 25th place. As on Thursday, the Forti drivers again had to share a single car, as Moreno&#x27;s car developed a misfire: he qualified in 24th position, two places behind Diniz. The grid, which was covered by just over 9.5 seconds, was completed by the absent Inoue.

===Race===
On Sunday morning, a pre-race warm-up session took place at 11:00 local time, and lasted for 30 minutes. It took place in dry weather conditions. Alesi led his teammate Berger at the top of the standings with a time of 1:24.356; both Ferrari drivers trying their race and spare cars. Schumacher was third, ahead of Häkkinen, Herbert, and Hill, who was concerned about the development of understeer in the handling of his race car, particularly in the track&#x27;s slower corners. Coulthard set the 11th-fastest time, and the Williams team, worried about its cars&#x27; pace in race trim, opted to switch its planned pit strategy from one stop to two, hoping that the cars would handle better on the relatively lighter fuel load required for such tactics. Meanwhile, the Sauber mechanics had built up a new spare car for Frentzen (who was now driving the team&#x27;s original spare car after the damage to his race car was found to be irreparable) and also repaired Boullion&#x27;s damaged machine. Their Jordan counterparts had performed similar work on Irvine&#x27;s car, whilst Barrichello&#x27;s car suffered a broken wheel rim. Inoue was cleared to race, and set the slowest time of the session in the spare Footwork.

As was traditional in Monaco, the race began at the relatively late time of 15:30, allowing Prince Rainier and his family to eat lunch before viewing the event from the royal box on the start-finish straight. The race took place in warm, sunny conditions, with an ambient temperature of , and was watched by a total of approximately 48,000 spectators. As the drivers completed their reconnaissance laps from the pit-lane to the starting grid, an oil leak was discovered on Frentzen&#x27;s Sauber, so he switched to the newly built spare car in time for the start.

As the green light signalled the start of the race, Hill and Schumacher both made brisk starts and led into Sainte Dévote, but behind them a multiple collision between Coulthard and the two Ferraris caused the race to be red-flagged to a halt. Coulthard was slightly slower away from the line and was challenged on the outside of the run to the first corner by Berger, and on the inside by Alesi. As the track narrowed at the entry to Sainte Devote, there was not enough space for the three cars to run side-by-side, and Alesi made contact with the rear-right quarter of Coulthard&#x27;s car, which in turn pushed it into Berger. The Williams was launched up into the air and spun through 180 degrees before crashing down again and coming to a halt at the apex of the corner with broken suspension, whilst the two damaged Ferraris also made further contact with each other before coming to rest at the same point. Most of the pursuing drivers, led by Brundle, threaded their way through the stationary cars, but Irvine knocked off his front wing, Boullion sustained a broken diffuser, and Katayama, Salo, Morbidelli, Inoue and Schiattarella were all forced to come to a halt as they negotiated the obstacles. With the track now completely blocked, the race was halted and preparations were immediately made for a completely fresh start.

Coulthard, Berger and Alesi&#x27;s cars had been damaged beyond immediate repair; all three were thus forced to race their teams&#x27; spare cars, vindicating Ferrari&#x27;s customary Monaco practice of bringing an additional car for each driver. Berger&#x27;s spare car, however, was fitted with an earlier-specification engine that did not produce quite as much power as his race car or Alesi&#x27;s spare car, whilst the throttle on Coulthard&#x27;s car was not fully calibrated in the rush to ready it for the restarted race. Irvine&#x27;s Jordan and Boullion&#x27;s Sauber were repaired, and the other drivers stuck at the first corner were able to restart their cars, apart from Salo and Schiattarella: the former&#x27;s Yamaha engine overheated in the jam, requiring him to take the restart from the pit-lane in the spare Tyrrell, and the latter&#x27;s Simtek was damaged by marshals attempting to move it from the scene of the accident. The impoverished team lacked a spare car, so Schiattarella could not take any further part in the race, and Simtek&#x27;s participation in the event was ended – without either car completing a racing lap – when Verstappen&#x27;s car suffered a recurrence of its persistent gearbox problems and was pushed into the pit-lane as the rest of the field embarked upon the second formation lap.

At the restart, Hill and Schumacher again held their positions, whilst Coulthard led the more circumspect Ferraris through Sainte Dévote, with Alesi jumping ahead of Berger. On this occasion there were no major incidents, although Katayama sustained light damage to his car&#x27;s front wing as a result of a brush with Morbidelli. As the drivers completed the first lap, Hill led by 0.5 seconds from Schumacher, who was followed in turn by Coulthard, Alesi, Berger, Herbert, Häkkinen, Irvine, Brundle, Barrichello, Blundell, Panis, Frentzen, Badoer, Morbidelli, Katayama, Martini, Boullion, Gachot, Moreno, Montermini, Salo, Diniz and Inoue. In the early laps, Hill gradually built a lead of nearly two seconds over Schumacher by lap 10, with the two pulling away in tandem from Coulthard, who was at this point a further eight seconds behind the Benetton. By this stage there had already been two retirements: Häkkinen&#x27;s Mercedes engine failed due to a fuel pump drive problem on the ninth lap of the race, and Moreno spun at Sainte Dévote when a brake fluid leak caused him to lose control of his Forti a lap later. Morbidelli also made an early unscheduled stop to cure a serious tyre vibration caused by a section of tie-rope from a tyre-warming blanket becoming jammed in one of his rear wheels, the Footwork driver dropping to the tail of the field in the process.

This was the third event to take place with electronic sensors monitoring every car for jump-starts, and at this stage of the race, six drivers (Barrichello, Brundle, Montermini, Frentzen, Morbidelli and Panis) were issued with ten-second stop-go penalties for this offence. All except Montermini came in promptly to serve their penalties – some even having to form a queue in the penalty area – but the Pacific driver failed to pit within the stipulated three laps of receiving it, whereupon he was disqualified from the race, having climbed to 17th place before belatedly serving his penalty. The penalised drivers dropped back through the field as a result of losing time, with the result that after 16 laps completed, the race order was: Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi, Berger, Herbert, Irvine, Blundell, Badoer, Katayama, Brundle, Martini, Barrichello, Panis, Frentzen, Boullion, Salo, Montermini (yet to serve his penalty), Gachot, Inoue, Diniz and Morbidelli.

===Post-race===
The incident between Inoue and the safety car in practice was referred to the FIA World Motor Sport Council, which met one month after the race. The ACM received no punishment for the incident, and negotiated the payment of damages to Footwork directly with the team.

==Classification==

===Qualifying===

===Race===

* Montermini was black flagged for failing to serve his stop-and-go penalty within the required three laps since its issue.
* Verstappen&#x27;s result is often given as a retirement rather than a failure to start, even though he did not take the second start as his gearbox failed at the start of the second formation lap.
* Schiattarella did not take the restart as his undamaged car was not recovered from the first corner, and was later seriously damaged when it fell off a recovery vehicle.

<text>The 1995 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 11 June 1995 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal. It was the sixth race of the 1995 Formula One season.

It produced the only Grand Prix victory for French driver Jean Alesi. This was seen as a popular victory, as Alesi had waited over five years for a victory and he was driving the red number 27 Ferrari, as driven by Canadian Gilles Villeneuve. Adding to the victory was that the win also occurred on Alesi&#x27;s 31st birthday. This race also marked the last time to date that a Grand Prix was won by a car with a V12 engine, as well as the only race of the season won by a non-Renault-powered car.

Michael Schumacher led until a late problem with his gearbox necessitated a long pit stop. Several other regular front-runners had problems, allowing both Jordan drivers to finish on the podium for the first time in the team&#x27;s history. Jordan had scored their first-ever GP points in Montreal four years earlier.

After Alesi crossed the finish line, race fans broke through the fences and charged the pit area. When Alesi entered the hairpin at the far end of the circuit on his victory lap, his car ran out of fuel, and Alesi removed his steering wheel, stood on top of the car and &quot;surfed&quot; it to a stop. Schumacher, approaching from behind, stopped and gave Alesi a lift back to the pits on top of his car.

Also, that Sunday evening, the first rumours started circulating that Michael Schumacher had signed a multimillion-dollar contract with Ferrari for 1996.

The race was run over 69 laps, but the results were declared after 68 laps because of crowd invasion just after Alesi had finished. In original results, Luca Badoer finished in 7th, ahead of Mika Salo who had stopped next to the pit wall to avoid hitting spectators.

==Report==

===Background===
One thing that was noted in the build-up to the race weekend was the bumpiness of the circuit, with the drivers in the post-qualifying press conference noting that the circuit should be resurfaced. It was also noted that overtaking into the new chicane was banned, although the length of the ban was unclear, with Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill unclear whether the drivers were not allowed to overtake into the chicane for just the first lap, or for every lap.

===Practice and qualifying===
Schumacher&#x27;s pole position was the 100th for a Renault powered car and the ninth of his career.

===Race day===
The 30-minute warm-up session was held in wet conditions, with rain constantly falling since the early morning, the first time rain had fallen over the Grand Prix weekend. Hill was one of the few drivers to make a mistake, spinning at the newly installed chicane. Hill&#x27;s Williams teammate David Coulthard spun at the previous corner later in the session, while Bertrand Gachot also ran into the gravel trap. After a brief stay in the pits, an animated Hill went back onto the track, only to go off into the gravel trap, beaching his car. Due to the changing weather conditions, the order was mixed, with the Ferraris of Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger in first and third. Rubens Barrichello split them in second, with Schumacher fourth. Mika Häkkinen was fifth. The Saubers of Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jean-Christophe Boullion were 6th and 7th, with Luca Badoer in the Minardi rounding out the top 8. The two Williams drivers eventually finished in 12th and 16th.

The race started at 14:00 EDT (UTC−4). Michael Schumacher led for most of the race; however, an electrical problem with his Benetton-Renault towards the end of lap 57 forced him into the pits and allowed second-placed Jean Alesi to take the lead. The 70-second pit stop to change a steering wheel and perform an on-board computer adjustment meant that Schumacher rejoined the race in seventh place. He eventually made his way back to fifth place.

<text>The 1995 British Grand Prix (formally the XLVIII British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 16 July 1995 at Silverstone Circuit, Silverstone, Northamptonshire, England. It was the eighth round of the 1995 Formula One World Championship. Johnny Herbert for the Benetton team won the 61-lap race from fifth position. Jean Alesi finished second in a Ferrari, with David Coulthard third in a Williams car. The remaining points-scoring positions were filled by Olivier Panis (Ligier), Mark Blundell (McLaren) and Heinz-Harald Frentzen (Sauber). Herbert&#x27;s victory was his first in Formula One, and the Benetton team&#x27;s fifth of the season.

The race was dominated, however, by the fight between World Drivers&#x27; Championship protagonists, Michael Schumacher (Benetton) and Damon Hill (Williams). Hill, who started from a pole position achieved during qualifying sessions held in variable weather conditions, retained his lead during the opening stages of the race whilst Schumacher, who was alongside him on the starting grid, fell behind Alesi in the run to the first corner. Despite being held up behind the slower Ferrari until it made a pit stop, Schumacher used a more favourable one-stop strategy to move ahead of Hill, who made two pit stops for fuel and tyres, on lap 41. Four laps later, Hill attempted to pass Schumacher, but the two collided and were forced to retire from the race. This promoted Herbert and Coulthard, who were battling for third place, into the fight for the lead. Coulthard passed Herbert, but dropped to third, behind Alesi, after incurring a stop-go penalty for speeding in the pit lane.

==Background==
Heading into the eighth race of the season, Benetton driver Michael Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 46 points; ahead of Williams driver Damon Hill on 35, and the two Ferrari drivers, Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, on 26 and 17 points respectively. The Constructors&#x27; Championship was closer, with Benetton on 48 points leading Ferrari and Williams on 43 and 42 points respectively. After a hesitant start to the season, Schumacher had won three of the previous four Grands Prix, and arrived at Silverstone as the man to beat. Hill, on the other hand, had won the 1994 British Grand Prix and was eager to repeat the feat in front of his home fans. He had also set the fastest lap time in pre-event testing at Silverstone during the final week of June, almost a second in front of teammate David Coulthard, and a further 0.2 seconds ahead of Schumacher. The McLaren, Jordan, Footwork and Pacific teams also took part in these test sessions. Hill was also under some additional pressure going into the weekend, as his wife, Georgie, was due to give birth to their third child imminently.

There was one driver change going into the event: the Footwork team&#x27;s lead driver, Gianni Morbidelli, was replaced by compatriot Massimiliano Papis, an International Formula 3000 race winner who had also been the test driver for Team Lotus in 1994, before the outfit withdrew from the sport ahead of the 1995 season. Papis brought valuable sponsorship from Altea, a tie manufacturer, to the underfunded team, which supplemented the income already being provided by his pay driver teammate, Taki Inoue, to cover the team&#x27;s budget for the year. Morbidelli was kept on as the team&#x27;s test driver, and returned to racing action at the later in the year.

Pre-race discussion centred on the following year&#x27;s driver line-up, with Schumacher rumoured to be moving to Ferrari to replace Berger, who was considering a move to Williams. Hill&#x27;s future was also uncertain, as was his teammate David Coulthard&#x27;s, due to the McLaren team possessing an option on his services for . Sauber driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen was also linked to a possible vacant position for 1996 in the Williams team. Schumacher&#x27;s future plans dictated the rest of the driver market, due to his status as the reigning World Champion—and, indeed, the only such champion of all the contemporary drivers—and reputation as the best driver currently in Formula One. It was also reported that Schumacher&#x27;s teammate, Johnny Herbert, was in imminent danger of losing his Benetton seat to test driver Jos Verstappen, who was available due to the collapse of the Simtek team after the and was contractually owed race drives by team principal Flavio Briatore. Despite taking a podium finish earlier in the year, Herbert had rarely been close to Schumacher&#x27;s pace and had only completed two laps in the two previous Grands Prix. A potential new entry was also being discussed: the Japanese racing car constructor Dome was in the process of building a Formula One car with which to enter the World Championship in .

Several teams had made modifications to their cars in preparation for the event. Ferrari made changes to the 412T2 chassis&#x27;s sidepods to improve airflow around the tyres, and reverted to a diffuser design used earlier in the season. The Ligier team had Martin Brundle&#x27;s car fitted with power steering for the first time and he chose to use it for the race, but teammate Olivier Panis, who had run with the system earlier in the season, decided against it. McLaren revised its troubled MP4/10B chassis&#x27;s suspension geometry, and Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s car was equipped with a more powerful version of its Mercedes V10 engine for Sunday&#x27;s warm-up session and the race itself. Team principal Ron Dennis also re-hired experienced designer Steve Nichols, who had worked for the outfit in the 1980s, in the week before the race. Footwork also arrived with revised suspension, whilst the Jordan team ran with brake disc sensors on its car. Further down the field, the Forti team introduced the revised version of its FG01 chassis for Roberto Moreno. Lead driver Pedro Diniz had first driven the car in its revised specification at the preceding . The revised aerodynamic package included a higher nose and new sidepods. Both drivers also tested a new development of the Ford-Cosworth ED engine in practice.

In the week leading up to the race, Williams chief designer Adrian Newey reignited the controversy over the similarities between the Benetton B195 and Ligier JS41 chassis, which had first flared up at the season-opening . Despite the fact that a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) investigation had declared the JS41 legal earlier in the season, Newey stated that &quot;as far as suspension geometry and aerodynamics are concerned, I&#x27;d say they are identical. [...] Taken to a logical conclusion, we&#x27;ll be in an IndyCar position. It is very dangerous.&quot; As part of the Williams team&#x27;s own preparations for the race, Hill tested a Williams FW17 equipped with brakes made from steel, rather than the standard carbon fibre, and was reputedly impressed by their performance.

==Practice and qualifying==
Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held from 09:30 to 11:15 local time on Friday, and an identically timed session was also held on Saturday. Each driver was limited to 23 laps of free practice per day. The qualifying period was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon from 13:00 to 14:00 local time, with the second held on Saturday afternoon at the same time. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final grid position. Each driver was limited to twelve laps per qualifying session.

Schumacher set the pace in Friday free practice, which took place in dry and cloudy weather conditions, with a time of 1:29.238. Hill was less than four hundredths of a second behind, ahead of Alesi, Coulthard, Herbert and Berger; the drivers from the top three teams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship thus filled the top six positions. Despite his fastest time, Schumacher was unhappy with the handling of his Benetton, reporting more understeer than had been present in pre-event testing at the circuit.

Weather conditions for Friday qualifying were dry and sunny, albeit blustery, which meant that drivers had to cope with strong crosswinds in the circuit&#x27;s many high-speed corners. The session was marked by an intense fight for pole position between championship protagonists Schumacher and Hill, which was watched by a crowd of 37,000 spectators. Schumacher initially set the pace with a time of 1:29.151, which he later improved to 1:28.387. Hill initially struggled to match his rival&#x27;s time in the final, twistier sector of the lap, but made a set-up change and took provisional pole with a time of 1:28.124 in the final ten minutes. Schumacher—who had increased the level of downforce on his car to compensate for the understeer, only to find that the reduction in straightline speed was too great—was demoted to second position, but was confident that he and the team could improve the car&#x27;s handling for Saturday&#x27;s session. Coulthard was more than 0.8 seconds slower than Hill in third place, and blamed the strong crosswinds for making his car feel very unstable at the rear end. Berger and Alesi set the fourth and sixth fastest times respectively for Ferrari, both drivers disadvantaged by a lack of straightline speed compared to the Renault-powered Williams and Benetton cars, and the fact that the Italian team was not allowed to take part in pre-event testing at the circuit as per the FIA&#x27;s regulations. Team principal Jean Todt, however, described lack of testing as &quot;a feeble excuse&quot; for the team&#x27;s loss of form compared with earlier races in the season. Herbert separated the Ferrari drivers in the second Benetton, also complaining of rear-end stability problems with his car. Eddie Irvine set the seventh quickest time in his Jordan despite suffering a recurring brake balance problem, ahead of Häkkinen in the faster of the two McLaren cars. This formation was continued on the fifth row of the grid, which was occupied by Rubens Barrichello in the other Jordan and Mark Blundell in the other McLaren. Brundle qualified in 11th position, more than a second in front of Ligier teammate Panis in 13th; both drivers complained that their cars rode the bumps on the track badly. The two were split by Frentzen in the quicker of the two Sauber drivers, who set a best time 1.5 seconds faster than his own teammate, Jean-Christophe Boullion, in 16th. Ukyo Katayama was 14th quickest for the Tyrrell team, ahead of Pierluigi Martini&#x27;s Minardi, the latter&#x27;s best qualifying performance of the season. Behind Boullion, Papis set the 17th fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session, split from teammate Taki Inoue by Luca Badoer in the second Minardi, who was unable to complete his allocated laps after spinning and breaking the car&#x27;s gearbox. The times were completed by Diniz and Moreno in the Forti cars, who sandwiched Bertrand Gachot&#x27;s Pacific car. Two drivers failed to set times: Mika Salo failed to stop his Tyrrell at the pit-lane weighbridge despite the presence of a red light—indicating that his car had been selected to be weighed—and the stewards excluded his times as a result. Andrea Montermini did not take part in the session at all due to a failure of his car&#x27;s brake master cylinder; the underfunded Pacific team lacked the resources to bring a spare car to the event.

Saturday free practice took place in mixed weather conditions: the session was initially dry, but was then hit by a rain shower which dampened it somewhat; the times were thus slower and more spread out down the field than the previous day. Schumacher set the fastest time of 1:31.390, and said that he believed that his car&#x27;s handling was much improved compared with its performance on Friday. He was followed by Alesi, Coulthard, Herbert, Panis and Frentzen. Hill was left in 22nd position as a result of spinning off in the difficult conditions and then breaking his car&#x27;s transmission as he attempted to restart. Alesi had a controversial session: he set a fast time under yellow flag conditions for Hill&#x27;s spin. He later tangled with Gachot&#x27;s Pacific and recovered to the pit entry at high speed, where he had to spin to avoid marshals who were pushing the other Pacific of Montermini back to its garage. The race stewards witnessed the incident, but mistakenly called up Alesi&#x27;s teammate, Berger, instead. Alesi, once the correct identity of the driver involved had been established, was not penalised.

It continued to rain throughout Saturday&#x27;s qualifying session; the slower conditions meant that none of the top 24 drivers could improve upon their times from the previous day, setting the order of the starting grid and guaranteeing Hill pole position. Only Salo and Montermini&#x27;s times counted for their starting positions: the Tyrrell driver set the fourth-fastest time of the session, albeit 12 seconds slower than Moreno&#x27;s dry-weather Friday time, to take 23rd position on the grid; Montermini set a time almost four seconds slower again to complete the field. Many teams chose to complete only limited running in the wet conditions, to the frustration of the crowd: Häkkinen, Inoue and Gachot did not set a time, whilst Blundell, Diniz and Martini completed only exploratory laps. There was also frustration amongst the drivers and teams who felt that they had underperformed on Friday, and for Häkkinen and Irvine who had both been scheduled to run with more powerful engines which should have given an advantage in dry conditions. The Benetton mechanics also had a busy session: first Schumacher slid off the road at Stowe corner and had to rejoin the track by using part of the old circuit; then Herbert lost control of his car on standing water at the fast Copse corner, spearing off the road into a heavy impact against the tyre barriers. Herbert was uninjured and the Benetton mechanics were able to repair the B195&#x27;s monocoque. Coulthard set the quickest time of the session with a lap of 1:29.752, ahead of Schumacher, Alesi and Salo, with Hill, Barrichello, Brundle, Badoer, Irvine and Frentzen completing the top ten. Hill admitted that the wet session was &quot;a bit of a let-down&quot;, and was cautious on his race prospects, as he had failed to win from his two pole positions earlier in the season, but was delighted with the outcome nonetheless. Schumacher was also disappointed with the weather conditions, but was optimistic that his car was fully competitive in either the dry or wet.

The lack of on-track action caused by the wet conditions and the two-day qualifying system was a cause for concern amongst the Formula One paddock, members of which believed that members of the public who had paid to attend the session (spectator numbers were estimated at 40,000), or watch it on television, were being short-changed as a result. McLaren team principal Ron Dennis argued that the restriction on the use of the teams&#x27; spare cars should be lifted in the event of wet weather conditions, whilst Pacific designer Frank Coppuck advocated a points system for qualifying, in addition to aggregating the times over both days. FIA President Max Mosley confirmed that the current qualifying procedure was to be the subject of a review, with possible changes due to be introduced for the 1996 season. One-day qualifying was subsequently introduced from the 1996 Australian Grand Prix onwards.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
On Sunday morning, a pre-race warm-up session took place at 09:30 local time, and lasted for 30 minutes. It took place in dry weather conditions. Häkkinen, using his uprated Mercedes engine for the first time, set the session&#x27;s fastest time with a lap of 1:29.685. Despite the fact that the time was set on brand-new tyres, unlike many of those recorded by the opposition, it was still an encouraging boost for the McLaren team, which had endured a troubled season thus far. He was followed in the timesheets by Hill, Coulthard, Alesi, Berger and Schumacher. Hill reported that his car handled well in race trim, whilst Schumacher concentrated on fuel consumption tests, and did not attempt to set a particularly quick time. Berger, meanwhile, downplayed Ferrari&#x27;s chances, predicting that only a wet race would give either him or Alesi a chance of race victory. Herbert was down in 12th position as a result of a broken shock absorber, which was replaced in time for the race.

==Race==

It began to rain half an hour before the start of the race but soon stopped, so that the track was almost entirely dry by 14:00, with an ambient temperature of . A total of approximately 110,000 spectators attended the race, of whom 20,000 watched from grandstands. For the first time in the event&#x27;s history, general admission tickets were limited, to ensure that all spectators could get a good view of the track. Whilst on a reconnaissance lap, Montermini performed an illegal practice start, for which Pacific was given a fine of $5,000, suspended for three races.

When the race started, Hill maintained his advantage into the first corner, whilst Alesi made a fast start to slot into second position ahead of Schumacher. Salo also had an excellent getaway, rising to 17th place by the end of the first lap. Berger and Irvine, meanwhile, made poor starts as they struggled with slipping clutches, dropping to ninth and 13th positions respectively. At the end of the first lap, Hill led by 1.1 seconds from Alesi, who was followed by Schumacher, Coulthard, Herbert, Häkkinen, Barrichello, Brundle, Berger, Frentzen, Blundell, Panis, Irvine, Martini, Katayama, Boullion, Salo, Papis, Inoue, Gachot, Badoer, Diniz, Montermini and Moreno. On the second lap, Irvine tried to pass Panis at the Abbey chicane, but spun in the process and dropped further back, shortly before his engine cut out, making him the first retirement of the race. Elsewhere in the field, Berger passed Brundle, and Montermini moved ahead of Diniz. At the front of the pack, Hill was in control, extending his lead over Alesi to 6.2 seconds by lap 5 and to 12 seconds by lap 12. For his part, Schumacher was being held up by Alesi, the two cars running in formation in the early stages of the race. He was, however, unable to get close enough to attempt an overtaking manoeuvre, due to the aerodynamic turbulence created by the airflow over the Ferrari. There were passing opportunities further down the order, however: Blundell and Panis both overhauled Frentzen in the early laps; Katayama and Boullion moved ahead of Martini; and Badoer passed Gachot. At the tail of the field, Diniz made the first of three pit stops on lap 6 to investigate gear selection problems with his Forti from which he retired eight laps later, and his teammate Moreno also made an early stop on the tenth lap but continued, albeit one lap down on the leader.

As Hill extended his lead, the stewards informed the Jordan and Ligier teams that Barrichello and Panis had jumped the start, for which they were served with ten-second stop-go penalties. Both drivers had previously been penalised for the same offence at the French Grand Prix, and also the . Panis took his penalty on lap 12 and dropped from 11th to 14th position; Barrichello made a pit stop to serve his identical penalty three laps later, from seventh place, and rejoined in 11th. Both drivers later protested their innocence. Lap 15 also saw the first scheduled pit stop, as Coulthard, also held up by Alesi behind Schumacher, took on fresh fuel and tyres earlier than planned in a bid to move ahead of the Ferrari when it made its own visit to the pit lane. As he rejoined the race, Coulthard&#x27;s Williams suffered an electronic failure that affected the car&#x27;s throttle control when changing gears, but continued the race in ninth place regardless. The next few laps saw a flurry of activity in the pit lane as those drivers on two-stop strategies made pit stops at around one-third race distance, and also several retirements. On lap 17, Brundle spun out of seventh place at Luffield and beached his car in the gravel trap, and Inoue retired from 18th position after a similar mistake resulted in a stalled engine. On the same lap, Montermini made a pit stop from 19th place, which he maintained upon rejoining the race. On the following lap, Alesi made his pit stop from second position, releasing Schumacher, and rejoined in front of Coulthard, whilst Barrichello, recovering from his penalty, passed Frentzen for what had become eighth place.

Schumacher slowly began to reduce Hill&#x27;s lead, which had grown to 19.5 seconds. Salo made a pit stop on lap 19, dropping behind Papis and the Minardi drivers, but gained a position on Boullion when the Sauber driver stopped on the next lap. By this stage Häkkinen and Berger had risen to fourth and fifth respectively, but both retired on lap 21: Häkkinen&#x27;s McLaren suffering a progressive electronic problem which caused its hydraulic system to fail; Berger pulling off the track shortly after making his first pit stop due to an incorrectly fitted left-front wheel. The remaining two-stoppers made pit stops on laps 21 and 22: Herbert came in from third place and retained his position by rejoining ahead of Alesi and Coulthard; Blundell dropped from fourth to seventh, Gachot retained 16th; and Barrichello and Panis made their first scheduled stops, the Jordan dropping from seventh to eighth and the Ligier rejoining in 11th from ninth. At the head of the field, Hill came in on lap 22, rejoining nine seconds behind Schumacher, who now led the race. Two further retirements also occurred during this stage of the race: Montermini spun out of 17th place on lap 22, whilst Katayama, who was due in for a pit stop of his own, retired from eighth position when his engine cut due to fuel starvation on the following lap. At the end of lap 23, the running order was Schumacher, Hill, Herbert, Alesi, Coulthard, Frentzen, Blundell, Barrichello, Martini, Papis, Panis, Badoer, Salo, Boullion, Gachot and Moreno.

On new tyres, Hill began to reduce Schumacher&#x27;s nine-second lead, but after a few laps Schumacher began to ease away again as he had a lighter fuel load than the Williams. It became apparent to the teams, as the race approached half-distance, that Schumacher had opted for a one-stop strategy and that both he and Hill only had one stop remaining each. Frentzen, Papis and the Minardi drivers also opted for a single-stop race; Papis and Martini&#x27;s worn tyres allowing Panis to overtake them soon after his second stop. Papis made his first Formula One race pit stop on lap 28, only to hit the barrier at the exit of the pit lane, causing damage to his Footwork&#x27;s suspension which caused him to spin off and retire on the same lap that he rejoined the circuit. On the next lap Frentzen dropped from sixth to eighth position as a result of his sole stop, and was then passed by Panis four laps later; Martini likewise dropped from 10th to 13th on lap 30; and Badoer also moved from 10th to 13th when he made his stop on lap 32.

At the front of the field, Hill moved back into the lead of the race when Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 31, rejoining in second place with a deficit of 20 seconds. Hill now pushed hard in his efforts to build up a sufficient lead over Schumacher—setting the race&#x27;s fastest lap time of 1:29.752 on lap 37—to maintain first place after his second pit stop. Salo began the second round of pit stops on the next lap, and was followed in due course by Alesi, Herbert, Barrichello, Boullion, Gachot, Blundell, Panis and Coulthard. Coulthard&#x27;s stop, despite moving him ahead of Alesi, was problematic: his car&#x27;s electronic failure meant that his pit-lane speed-limiter system did not work, and he exceeded the pit-lane speed limit, an infraction of the Sporting Regulations which, like jumping the start, entailed a ten-second stop-go penalty. Hill made his own second stop on lap 41 with a 27-second lead over Schumacher and the two were almost level as Hill reached the end of the pit lane, but Schumacher&#x27;s extra momentum allowed him to move ahead in the run to the Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel sequence of fast corners. At the completion of the scheduled pit stops by lap 44, the running order was Schumacher and Hill in close attendance, then a gap back to a similar battle between Herbert and Coulthard, then Alesi, Blundell, Barrichello, Panis, Frentzen—whom Panis had just passed for the third time—Martini, Badoer, Salo, Boullion, Gachot and Moreno, the last of whom retired four laps later with a lack of hydraulic pressure in his Forti&#x27;s pneumatic engine valves.

Schumacher and Hill now had similar fuel loads, but Hill had a fresh set of tyres and immediately began pressuring Schumacher, quickly reducing the gap to less than half-a-second. On lap 46, Hill attempted a passing manoeuvre at Stowe corner, but was unable to complete it, due to the presence of Boullion&#x27;s lapped Sauber. Further around the lap, Hill tried again, diving up the inside of Schumacher at the entry to the Priory left-hander, but Schumacher turned in to take the racing line and the two collided, both spinning into the gravel trap, which caused their retirement from the race. The retirement of the two leaders promoted their teammates into their own battle for the lead; the two almost colliding at the same corner as Coulthard attempted to pass Herbert by making a lunge up the inside of his car, as Hill had done to Schumacher. Coulthard had not been informed about his stop-go penalty by the team, as they did not want to distract him, but he saw the penalty notification on one of the large television screens situated around the circuit. He passed Herbert on lap 49, but took his penalty two laps later and dropped to third position, behind Alesi. The Ferrari driver was still close behind Herbert, but cut his pace in the final laps as his 412T2&#x27;s oil pressure began to fade. With the top three positions settled, attention switched to Barrichello, who had closed up to the back of Blundell&#x27;s car and was faster than the McLaren driver. On the penultimate lap, Barrichello lined up his car to attempt a pass, but Blundell defended his position and the two collided: Barrichello crashed out, but Blundell was able to continue with a punctured left-rear tyre which allowed Panis to overtake him on the last lap. It was the second year in succession that Barrichello had collided with a McLaren driver in the closing stages, as he had made contact with Häkkinen on the last corner of the last lap the previous year when also battling for fourth place.

Thus Herbert took the chequered flag after 61 laps—at an average speed of —to win his first Formula One race at his 74th attempt, a result that also moved him from sixth to fourth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Alesi and Coulthard completed the podium, moving Ferrari ahead of Williams in the battle for second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Panis finished fourth, ahead of Blundell, who managed to finish despite his car running on three wheels for the final lap. Frentzen finished a lap down and completed the points-scoring positions, forty seconds ahead of a close group comprising Martini, Salo and Boullion. Salo closed in on the Minardi driver late in the race after passing his teammate, but was edged onto the grass whilst attempting a pass on the Hangar Straight and spun through 360 degrees. Badoer finished a further ten seconds behind this group, having also been passed by Boullion after his final pit stop. Barrichello was classified in 11th place, ahead of Gachot, who took his first race finish since the 1992 Belgian Grand Prix three laps behind Herbert.

==Post-race==
Herbert&#x27;s maiden Formula One victory was very popular amongst the spectators and team personnel, as not only was it his home race, but also because it came after a series of setbacks earlier in his career, not least a serious accident in an International Formula 3000 race at Brands Hatch in 1988 that left him with severe foot injuries which threatened his racing career. In the post-race press conference, Herbert paid tribute to three people who had particularly helped the progress of his career: his wife, Becky; Peter Collins, of whom Herbert said that &quot;he got me into F1 twice&quot;; and Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore for giving him his 1995 drive. Herbert&#x27;s win also came in front of his parents, Bob and Jane, who were selling his fan club merchandise at the circuit during the race meeting. In addition, the victory secured his immediate future within the Benetton team. Alesi declared himself &quot;very happy&quot; with his second place, but admitted to &quot;giving up&quot; in the second half of the race, as he knew that overtaking Herbert or Coulthard when they were ahead of him would have been almost impossible. For Coulthard, his result was bittersweet: he was pleased to finish the race despite the failure of his car&#x27;s electronics, but disappointed to lose an almost certain victory due to his pit-lane speeding penalty. A few days later, he described his race in a magazine column as &quot;one of those disappointing days when everything goes wrong&quot;.

The majority of media attention, however, was focussed on the aftermath of the collision between Schumacher and Hill on lap 46. Tension between the two had already been intensified by an incident during the French Grand Prix, where Schumacher had accused Hill of brake-testing him. After the crash, Schumacher blamed Hill, saying that: &quot;I think what Damon did was both stupid and totally unnecessary. There was no room for two cars there, and it&#x27;s not an overtaking place. If I hadn&#x27;t been there, I think he&#x27;d have gone straight on into the gravel. He just came from nowhere. Even in front of your home crowd, I think you have to keep your temperament under control. It was more or less the same situation at Adelaide last year [the occasion of the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, in which a collision between the two settled the Drivers&#x27; Championship in Schumacher&#x27;s favour], where he also tried to dive inside when there was no room.&quot; Hill was more cautious in his assessment of the incident, commenting that: &quot;I thought I saw an opportunity that I could take an advantage of, but I&#x27;m afraid Michael is a harder man to pass than that, and we had an accident—which I would describe as &#x27;a racing accident&#x27;&quot;. Journalists Alan Henry, Nigel Roebuck and Luc Domenjoz agreed that Hill&#x27;s lunge up the inside had been over-optimistic, but not malicious in intent.

Similarly, BBC commentator and former driver, Jonathan Palmer, said that Hill&#x27;s manoeuvre was the result of &quot;a rush of blood to the head&quot;. Journalist Joe Saward was amongst those who speculated, however, that Schumacher had played a role in the collision by taking a wider line into the Priory corner than usual, and thus encouraging Hill to attempt the manoeuvre. The incident was subject to a stewards&#x27; investigation, which resulted in both drivers being given a severe reprimand and a warning that &quot;future similar actions may result in severe penalties&quot;. The collision overshadowed the fact that, in the opinion of Roebuck, Benetton had again chosen a better race strategy than Williams, and that Schumacher would have had a comfortable lead had he not been stuck behind Alesi in the early stages of the race. There was also similar ill-feeling between Barrichello and Blundell after their collision on lap 60. Barrichello accused Blundell of brake-testing him prior to the incident, and of causing the crash by changing his driving line too quickly, whilst Blundell denied the allegations and drew attention to Barrichello&#x27;s similar collision with Häkkinen the previous year. The stewards also investigated this incident and gave Blundell a severe reprimand for his actions.

In the week following the race, it was reported in several British newspapers that Frank Williams, founder and team principal of the Williams team, had visited the Benetton garage after the race where he had apologised to Schumacher and Briatore for the incident, during which he had allegedly referred to Hill as a &quot;&quot;. On the same day, a Williams team spokesman stated that Hill was backed by Frank Williams and technical director Patrick Head, and that the incident was a natural part of motor racing. Frank Williams then issued a personal statement denying the newspaper reports. Hill also telephoned the owner of Formula One&#x27;s commercial rights, Bernie Ecclestone, for advice on how to handle the situation. Ecclestone advised him to apologise to Schumacher, which Hill decided against. The crash was still the main talking point throughout the sport by the time of the , exacerbated by the fact that Hill&#x27;s home race was immediately followed by Schumacher&#x27;s.

<text>The 1995 German Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland) was a Formula One motor race held at the Hockenheimring, Hockenheim on 30 July 1995. It was the ninth race of the 1995 Formula One World Championship.

The 45-lap race was won by local driver Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Renault, after he started from second position. Briton Damon Hill took pole position in his Williams-Renault, but spun off on lap 2 as a result of a driveshaft failure. Hill&#x27;s compatriot and teammate David Coulthard finished second, with Austrian Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari.

With the win, his fifth of the season, Schumacher extended his lead over Hill in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 21 points.

== Summary ==
Damon Hill started the race from the pole position alongside Michael Schumacher. After making a good start, Hill spun on entry to the first corner on the 2nd lap sending his car across a gravel trap and into a tyre barrier, ending his race. A driveshaft failure caused Hill&#x27;s Williams to lock its rear wheels and initiated his spin off the track. 

Schumacher was left leading David Coulthard and Gerhard Berger, who was given a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for jumping the start of the race. The penalty dropped Berger to 14th position though he fought back to finish back in 3rd place. Berger denied jumping the start, claiming that though his car did move slightly when he put it into gear, it was stationary when the green light came on to start the race.

Benetton&#x27;s 2-stop strategy for Schumacher prevailed over the 1-stop strategy Coulthard was on, as Schumacher pulled away from the field giving himself enough room to make his second pit stop and remain in the lead. Schumacher became the first German to win a World Championship German Grand Prix (other German drivers had won the German Grand Prix before the inception of the World Championship, the most recent being Rudolf Caracciola in 1939). His car broke down after the race had finished, as did that of team-mate Johnny Herbert and Aguri Suzuki (whose car caught fire).

Initially it was believed that Hill spun off due to oil laid down on the track from overfull oil tanks – as it is common practice for teams to fill the oil tanks prior to the start of the race. A few days after the race, the Williams team discovered that Hill&#x27;s car had in fact suffered from a driveshaft failure leading to his accident. Shortly before he went off, Murray Walker commented that he had noticed blue smoke coming out of the back of Hill&#x27;s car; the reason for this was never discovered.

It was the final F1 race of Pierluigi Martini, who retired with a blown engine and was replaced by Pedro Lamy for the next race.

<text>The 1995 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 27 August 1995 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, near the village of Francorchamps, Wallonia. It was the eleventh race of the 1995 Formula One World Championship.

The 44-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Renault. Despite qualifying only 16th, Schumacher took his sixth victory of the season after an intense battle with Damon Hill in the Williams-Renault. Hill settled for second, with Martin Brundle third in a Ligier-Mugen-Honda, which would be his last podium finish.

==Race report==
The race was attended by in excess of 100,000 people. Schumacher and Hill both qualified further down the grid than usual in a wet-dry qualifying session, but fought back during the race. Both Jean Alesi and Johnny Herbert briefly led the race, but Alesi broke down and Herbert struggled for pace once the track was dry. Polesitter Gerhard Berger struggled before dropping out.

David Coulthard pulled away at the front for Williams before suffering a gearbox problem, leaving Hill to lead the race. When Hill made his first pit stop for fresh slick tyres, Schumacher took over at the head of the field. It then started to rain and while Hill went back to the pits for wet weather tyres, Schumacher stayed out on his dry weather slicks. The Williams driver rapidly caught up with the German, but despite lapping six seconds a lap slower, Schumacher was able to keep Hill behind him until he went off the wet track and Hill passed him. Almost immediately the changing track conditions began to favour slicks once more and Schumacher re-passed Hill who pitted again, this time for slicks.

The rain intensified again and the field levelled out when the safety car appeared. Both drivers pitted for wets and returned to the track with Schumacher narrowly ahead of Hill. This appeared to set the two title rivals up for a battle for the lead going into the last ten laps, but Hill then had to pit again to serve a ten-second stop-go penalty for pit lane speeding, a penalty he served with six laps to go, and which put him down to third. Hill recovered to pass Martin Brundle on the Kemmel straight on the final lap to regain second place.

Schumacher&#x27;s performance did not impress Hill after his defensive moves forced Hill to either back off or go off the track. Schumacher claimed that he had only blocked Hill at the low-speed corners, but video evidence suggested that Schumacher had blocked Hill on some of the high speed corners, such as the &quot;Radillion&quot; and &quot;Blanchimont&quot;. Hill later commented that &quot;We (he and Schumacher) had some pretty hairy moments and I am not satisfied with being driven into; I don&#x27;t think that was acceptable. That is all well and good but if it was meant on purpose I would be very upset, F1 cars are not go-karts. I think there are some things which are acceptable and some things which are not.&quot; Schumacher defended himself by agreeing that touching wheels in high-speed corners is &quot;not acceptable&quot; but added that at the speed he and Hill were doing, he thought it was acceptable. Schumacher was given a one-race suspended ban for driving aggressively in order to stop Hill from passing.

<text>The 1995 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Pioneer 66º Gran Premio d&#x27;Italia) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 September 1995 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Monza, Italy. It was the twelfth race of the 1995 Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by British driver Johnny Herbert, driving a Benetton-Renault, after starting from eighth position. Finn Mika Häkkinen was second in a McLaren-Mercedes, with German Heinz-Harald Frentzen third in a Sauber-Ford, achieving both his and the Sauber team&#x27;s first F1 podium finish.

==Report==
Pole-sitter David Coulthard spun off on the formation lap exiting the Ascari chicane, and retired in the pitlane as the grid formed for the start. However, the race was stopped after a first lap collision at the same spot (on dust he had dragged onto the corner when attempting to rejoin) involving Max Papis, Jean-Christophe Boullion, Roberto Moreno, and Andrea Montermini, resulting in a blocked track. Coulthard was able to take the restart from pole again (in a spare car set up for Damon Hill), whilst Moreno and Montermini failed to take the restart due to a lack of spare cars. Coulthard led until a wheel bearing failed, leaving Gerhard Berger in the lead. Behind, Hill and Michael Schumacher had their second major collision of the season; the previous one having happened at the British Grand Prix. As Hill attempted to lap Taki Inoue&#x27;s Footwork, Hill crashed into the back of Schumacher when braking for the second chicane, causing both to retire. Schumacher ran over to the Williams to confront Hill whilst the British driver sat in his cockpit, but was immediately pulled away by marshals. Schumacher later apologised to Hill when Inoue admitted the incident was his fault, as he had slid in front of Hill while being passed by Schumacher, causing Hill to take evasive action and inadvertently run into the back of Schumacher&#x27;s car. Hill was subsequently given a one race suspended ban for his part in the collision.

After the pitstops the Ferraris were running first and second. Berger suffered a bizarre retirement when a TV camera on Jean Alesi&#x27;s rear wing flew off and destroyed Berger&#x27;s suspension. Alesi looked set to win his second Grand Prix but subsequently retired with a wheel bearing failure with just 8 laps to go. Alesi had also retired from the lead the previous year. This succession of retirements handed a second victory to Johnny Herbert, and then best-ever results to Mika Häkkinen and Heinz-Harald Frentzen - the first podium finish for the Sauber team in F1. Papis was on course for his first points finish, until he was overtaken by Boullion on the final lap.

<text>The 1995 Portuguese Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prémio de Portugal) was a Formula One motor race held on 24 September 1995 at the Autódromo do Estoril, Estoril, Portugal. It was the thirteenth race of the 1995 Formula One season. The 71-lap race was the first Formula One win for David Coulthard of the Williams team after starting from pole position Coulthard became the first Scottish driver to win a Grand Prix since Jackie Stewart won the 1973 German Grand Prix 22 years previously. Michael Schumacher was second in a Benetton, with Damon Hill third in the latter Williams car. After several controversial incidents previously involving Schumacher and Hill in the 1995 season, including collisions at Silverstone, Spa and Monza (the latter two of which saw confrontations between the two drivers respectively on the podium and at track-side), Schumacher and Hill shook hands with each other at the podium presentation following this race.

== Report ==

=== Background ===
To optimise their chances of winning at the Autódromo do Estoril, Williams brought an upgraded chassis to the race, a &quot;B&quot; specification of their FW17 car. The upgraded chassis would be used throughout the remainder of the season.

=== Practice and qualifying ===
Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout. Häkkinen set the fastest time in the first session, posting a lap of 1:23.073, one-tenth of a second quicker than Hill and Schumacher, in second and third places respectively. Coulthard was fourth, with the Ferrari cars fifth and sixth fastest; Gerhard Berger ahead of Jean Alesi. Häkkinen was eleventh in the second practice session, two seconds slower than Hill, who was fastest with a time of 1:21.443. Coulthard was second in the Williams, eight-tenths of a second behind Hill. Schumacher was third, with Alesi fourth, both over a second behind Hill. Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Sauber was fifth with Martin Brundle in the Ligier, Eddie Irvine in a Jordan and Berger rounding out the top eight positions.

===Race===
As the race began from its standing start, Ukyo Katayama who qualified in 16th moved into the racing path of Luca Badoer, whose Minardi began in 18th. The contact caused Katayama&#x27;s Tyrrell to launch airborne and spin several times upside down along the start/finish straight. Katayama was extracted from the car and hospitalized for two days with what was later diagnosed with a strained neck and bruising in the crash.

<text>The 1995 European Grand Prix (formally the XL Grand Prix of Europe) was a Formula One motor race held on 1 October 1995 at the Nürburgring, Nürburg, Germany. It was the fourteenth race of the 1995 Formula One World Championship and the first to be held there since 1985. Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team won the 67-lap race starting from third position. Jean Alesi finished second in a Ferrari, with David Coulthard, who started the Grand Prix from pole position, third in a Williams car. This was also the last F1 race for three drivers: Massimiliano Papis, Gabriele Tarquini, and Jean-Denis Délétraz.

Damon Hill, Coulthard&#x27;s teammate, started the race in second, but dropped down to third behind Schumacher on the opening lap. Hill remained behind Schumacher for the majority of the race, before losing his front wing in a collision with Alesi and dropping back due to the resultant pit stop. He then spun off the track on lap 58 when running in fourth position, leading to his retirement from the race. Alesi looked set to win the race after starting the race with dry weather slick tyres on a damp track, but was held up in lapped traffic and overtaken by Schumacher two laps before the end of the race.

Schumacher&#x27;s win retained his position at the top of the Drivers&#x27; Championship, 27 points ahead of Hill. With three races remaining, Schumacher only required a further three points to secure the championship. Benetton were now 20 points ahead of Williams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship following Schumacher&#x27;s win.

== Background ==
The race marked the return to the Formula One calendar for the Nürburgring track after being off the calendar since the 1985 season, due to commercial disputes involving the circuit&#x27;s promoters. Its return to the World Championship schedule was facilitated by a surge of interest in the sport throughout Germany as a result of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s drivers&#x27; title in . The 1994 European Grand Prix the previous year had been held at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain, a late replacement for the cancelled Argentine Grand Prix. This would be the third time that Formula One would utilise the short GP-Strecke layout rather than the almost 23 kilometre Nordschleife layout which was used until 1976.

Heading into the European Grand Prix, the 14th race of the season, Benetton driver Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 72 points, ahead of Williams driver Damon Hill in second on 55. Behind them were Hill&#x27;s teammate David Coulthard on 39, Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Johnny Herbert on 38, and Ferrari driver Jean Alesi on 34 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Benetton were leading with 100 points, with Williams second on 88 and Ferrari third on 62.

There was one driver swap heading into the race: Gabriele Tarquini replaced Ukyo Katayama at Tyrrell, the latter driver choosing not to race on doctors&#x27; advice following a crash at the earlier in the year. Katayama had sustained a strained neck and bruising in the crash, in which his car had rolled several times following a start line collision with Luca Badoer&#x27;s Minardi.

Prior to the race weekend, Coulthard announced that he was moving to the McLaren team for the 1996 season. He had first signed a contract with McLaren in October 1994 before his full-time Williams drive for 1995 was confirmed, and his one-year deal with the latter was not renegotiated due to his McLaren commitment. McLaren also confirmed that Mika Häkkinen and Jan Magnussen would continue in their existing roles as race and test driver for the team respectively, leaving Mark Blundell without a team for 1996. Coulthard&#x27;s deal was officially confirmed on the day of the race itself. Meanwhile, Coulthard&#x27;s prospective replacement, Jacques Villeneuve, had tested a Williams for the first time since being confirmed as Hill&#x27;s teammate for 1996, running for two days at the Monza circuit. The Jordan team had also announced that it would keep its driver pairing of Rubens Barrichello and Eddie Irvine for 1996 in the week before the race. However, Ferrari then announced that it had bought out Irvine&#x27;s contract, and that he would be partnering Schumacher at the team for 1996. Jordan subsequently announced that Martin Brundle would move from the Ligier team to partner Barrichello instead.

Some teams brought upgrades to the cars into the race – the Williams team used the upgraded &quot;B&quot; versions of the FW17 chassis for the second time, after its début at the previous race in Portugal. McLaren also brought upgrades to coincide with the home race of their engine supplier, Mercedes. The team opted to amalgamate the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; versions of its troublesome MP4/10 chassis, with a rear end and gearbox from the former. In addition, the Ferrari team brought a revised rear wing and sidepods for its 412T2 car, which both drivers agreed to be an improvement.

== Practice and qualifying ==
This was the first Formula One race to be held at the Nürburgring since the 1985 German Grand Prix, so an additional familiarisation session was held prior to the usual practice and qualifying sessions. In this session, Schumacher set a benchmark time of 1:20.418, ahead of Hill in second, Coulthard, Häkkinen, Heinz-Harald Frentzen (Sauber), Gerhard Berger (Ferrari) and the rest of the field. The drivers, were uninspired by the circuit: Schumacher described it as &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;easy to learn, with no real challenges&quot; and Coulthard predicted a processional race without much overtaking.

Two practice sessions were held before the race: on Friday morning and on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry in the first session, but wet for the second session. Hill set the fastest time in the first session, posting a lap of 1:19.343, three-hundredths of a second quicker than teammate Coulthard in second place. The Benettons were third and fifth fastest; Schumacher ahead of Herbert, with Ferrari driver Gerhard Berger fourth, over a second behind Hill. Häkkinen rounded out the top six in his McLaren. The wet conditions for the second practice session meant that lap times were slower as there was less grip on the track. In the second session, Hill was again fastest with a time of 1:34.906. Coulthard was second, with Frentzen third in the Sauber, two seconds slower than Hill. The Ferraris were fourth and fifth, Berger in front of Alesi. Schumacher and Herbert were sixth and seventh respectively, with Barrichello eighth. Olivier Panis in the Ligier and Mika Salo in the Tyrrell rounded out the top ten, both three and a half seconds off the fastest lap time. Amongst the slower runners, Andrea Montermini suffered a worrying moment when his Pacific car shed its left-rear wheel, but he was able to return to his pit garage.

The was split into two one-hour sessions; the first of which was held on Friday afternoon and the second on Saturday afternoon. The fastest time from either session counted towards the drivers&#x27; final grid positions. Both sessions were interrupted by rain, which led to little action on the track. Coulthard took his third consecutive pole position in his Williams, with a time of 1:18.738. He was joined on the by teammate Hill, who was two-tenths of a second behind. Schumacher was third in the Benetton, four-tenths of a second slower than Coulthard, despite lapping fastest in the second part of qualifying. The time he set in the second part of qualifying was still slower than Coulthard and Hill&#x27;s time set in the first part and he was third quickest overall. Behind the leading three, Berger was fourth with teammate Alesi in sixth. Eddie Irvine in the Jordan finished in fifth position. Herbert and Frentzen were on the fourth row on the grid, in seventh and eighth. Despite bringing car upgrades to the event, Häkkinen and Blundell could only qualify their McLarens ninth and tenth respectively. Tarquini qualified in nineteenth, four places behind teammate Salo, but admitted to feeling out-of-practice by Formula One standards. Several drivers went off the track during qualifying in the difficult conditions, including Panis and Montermini. Panis&#x27; crash was caused by a stuck throttle; the resultant damage to the car forced him to switch to the team&#x27;s spare monocoque. The conditions during the first session were generally faster, with seventeen of the 24 drivers setting their fastest qualifying times in this period.

Media attention focussed on Coulthard outperforming Hill in qualifying for the fourth time in a row. As Hill was mathematically the only possible contender to challenge Schumacher for the championship, there was a question from the media as to whether Williams should use to give Hill pole position. In response, Coulthard said that he was &quot;rather tired of questions about team orders&quot;, adding that &quot;everyone wants to see is a motor race&quot; and it wasn&#x27;t fair of Williams to ask him to slow down if he was faster than Hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;pg201/204&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the session, Barrichello and Footwork driver Massimiliano Papis revealed that they expected to fail routine drugs tests they had just taken, as both had been taking decongestants, for nasal problems and a cold respectively, which contained the banned substance ephedrine. On Saturday, the team principals also met to discuss future changes to the sport: it was agreed that qualifying would be reduced to a single hour-long session for the 1996 season, and a reduction from seventeen to sixteen Grands Prix was confirmed.

=== Qualifying classification ===
== Race ==
The track surface for the start of the race was damp, but dried up as the race progressed. The drivers were scheduled to go onto the track at 09:30 CET (GMT +1) for a 30-minute warm-up session; however, the session was delayed until 10:05 CET due to fog and heavy rain. Several drivers went off the track during the session due to the wet weather conditions. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard had the fastest time of 1:38.378 whilst Hill was third in the other Williams. Berger split them in the Ferrari for second position. Schumacher completed the top four, six-tenths of a second behind Coulthard. Approximately 90,000 spectators attended the circuit on race day.

Coulthard was forced to use the Williams , which had been set up for Hill for the race itself after he spun off the track during his , stalling the engine in the process. The race was scheduled to start at 14:00 CET, but Papis stalled his Footwork in the starting lights procedure, resulting in the start being aborted, with a new start time of 14:05 CET being planned. Many of the teams started the race with wet weather tyres, but the Ferrari and McLaren teams chose to fit their cars with dry weather slick tyres. The Ferrari mechanics also raised the ride height and increased the downforce levels on Alesi and Berger&#x27;s cars on the grid, making them more competitive in the wet conditions.

Coulthard, from pole position, held onto the lead into the first corner, while Hill made a bad start and was overtaken by Schumacher in the run down to the corner. Irvine also passed Hill, but was later overtaken on in the opening lap. Further down the order, Frentzen was judged to have made a false start, while Papis took up his normal grid position instead of starting from the back as he should have done after stalling. Both drivers were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties in the early stages of the race. Papis&#x27; teammate, Taki Inoue, failed to take the start due to an electronic failure.

The McLarens and Berger&#x27;s Ferrari slipped back in the early laps of the race, with both McLarens overtaken by the Pacific and Forti cars as they dropped down the order. The McLaren chassis handled badly in the wet conditions, while the throttle response of the Mercedes engine was also too abrupt to be driven effectively in the rain. Berger dropped to ninth place suffering from an incorrectly pressured set of tyres that left him with a handling imbalance. Alesi moved up to fourth position, overtaking Herbert on lap five and Irvine on lap eight. Berger and the McLarens moved back up the order as drivers made a pit stop for slick tyres. As the front-runners made their stops, Alesi ended up twenty seconds ahead of Coulthard, Schumacher and Hill. By the end of lap 17, most of the drivers had pitted for slick tyres and the running order had stabilised as Alesi led ahead of Coulthard, Schumacher, Hill, Berger and Irvine. Frentzen was outside the points in seventh, but on the next lap he collided with Pedro Diniz&#x27;s Forti while trying to lap him, retiring from the race as a result. Panis and Blundell were also out by this stage, both having spun off the track on lap 15.

Near the front of the field, Hill was faster than third-placed Schumacher and began to catch him. Schumacher defended his position vigorously several times, but Hill eventually passed him. However, Hill then ran wide at the final corner and Schumacher overtook him. Coulthard, in the other Williams, began to suffer from excessive oversteer with his car&#x27;s handling, dropping to fourth behind Schumacher and Hill, who passed him on laps 21 and 23 respectively. As Schumacher and the Williams drivers battled for position, Alesi was able to extend his lead at the front to 45 seconds. On lap 34 Alesi made his only pit stop, while Schumacher made his second of three scheduled pit visits. Alesi exited from pits just in front of third-placed Hill, who attempted to overtake Alesi on lap 40, the lap before his own pit stop was due to take place. In the process, the two cars made contact and Hill lost his front wing and had to pit to replace the damaged wing, losing time while driving around the track with his damaged car and rejoined behind Coulthard in fourth position. On the same lap, Berger retired with terminal engine problems. After his stop, Hill pushed hard in an attempt to catch Coulthard, but spun out of the race on lap 58. The impact with the tyre barrier was hard enough to cause a minor crack to a bone in his leg, but he escaped serious injury.

Schumacher made his final pit stop on lap 52 from second place, having caught up with Alesi during his third . He rejoined some distance behind the Ferrari, but set a fastest lap of 1:21.180 on lap 58, almost 1.7 seconds faster than Alesi&#x27;s fastest lap of the race. Alesi&#x27;s attempts to keep the lead were not helped by lapped traffic getting in his way, as well as losing five seconds at the Veedol chicane by running wide onto the gravel. In the closing laps, Schumacher caught Alesi, overtaking him on the outside of the chicane on lap 65. Schumacher opened the gap to two and a half seconds, and won the race after 67 laps to secure his seventh victory of the season in a time of 1:39:59.044.

Hill, watching from the side of the track, applauded Schumacher&#x27;s win. Schumacher attempted to stop his car to give Hill a lift back to the , but was unable due to a slipping clutch. Alesi held position to finish second in his Ferrari, with Coulthard third – 35 seconds behind. Completing the points-scorers, Barrichello finished fourth, ahead of Herbert and Irvine. The latter two had battled for much of the race: they collided on lap 31, dropping both behind Barrichello and causing Herbert to make a pit stop for a new front wing; later, Irvine spun while attempting to lap Papis, allowing Herbert back in front. Outside the points, Brundle finished seventh for Ligier, ahead of the recovering Häkkinen, whose eighth position, two laps down on Schumacher, was a major disappointment for Mercedes in its home country. Minardi drivers Pedro Lamy and Luca Badoer finished ninth and eleventh, with Salo in tenth position, the latter making an unscheduled pit stop to change a punctured tyre after colliding with Jean-Christophe Boullion during the race. The Sauber driver retired as a result of damage sustained in this incident.

Papis, Diniz, Tarquini and Délétraz completed the field. Of the retirements, Roberto Moreno stopped his Forti with a driveshaft failure, while Montermini endured a fraught pitstop on lap 42. The Pacific team&#x27;s fuel rig malfunctioned, and, in the confusion, refueller Paul Summerfield sustained a fractured left femur when he was hit by the car as it left its pit box. Montermini consequently ran out of fuel on lap 45.

, this was the last race where a V12-engined car finished on the podium.

===Race classification===
== Post-race ==
Journalist Alan Henry described the race as the best of the season to date, and even of recent memory, and suggested that Schumacher&#x27;s performance could mark a watershed in which the German &quot;crossed that indistinct dividing line separating the good from the great&quot;. Schumacher&#x27;s win put him 27 points ahead of Hill in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, meaning he required only three more points from the remaining races of the season to win championship. Hill, meanwhile, would have to win all three Grands Prix, effectively meaning that the Championship was over.

Hill commented that &quot;I am not going to be World Champion this year, but I&#x27;ll be back. But I don&#x27;t think I disgraced myself. I put up a good fight, did everything I could to win, and it didn&#x27;t come off&quot; and pledged to do his best to win the remaining races. Hill later said that the car&#x27;s steering had felt stiff since his collision with Alesi, making it difficult to drive, but accepted the blame for his retirement from the race. In the weeks after the race, heavy criticism was directed towards Hill, in which BBC pundit Murray Walker felt that he had not been &quot;forceful&quot; enough in his battle with Schumacher. In an interview before the Pacific race, Brundle said that he needed to get more aggressive and &quot;establish himself&quot; as the number one driver at Williams.

Schumacher said that Hill only made &quot;half-hearted attempts&quot; to overtake during the race which led to him &quot;getting into trouble&quot;. Alesi also blamed Hill for their collision, saying that &quot;I do not know what happened with Damon [Hill]. I saw his nose alongside me, that&#x27;s all. I was sideways [turning into the corner] and he hit me. He was too optimistic as normally you cannot do anything at that corner.&quot; At a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) World Motor Sport Council meeting on 19 October to discuss driver etiquette, they opted against introducing new rules on the issue. Formula One&#x27;s governing body emphasised that the International Sporting Code would be enforced on the basis that drivers are free to drive as they wish &quot;provided they do not deliberately endanger another driver or repeatedly obstruct him on a straight&quot;, following incidents during the year involving Hill and Schumacher.

Alesi, despite his performance in the early stages of the race, was also criticised for losing his lead after letting Schumacher gain time on him in the final laps. Ferrari designer John Barnard later blamed Alesi&#x27;s hesitance in lapped traffic for the loss of time, the rate of which Henry described as &quot;inexplicable&quot;. Alesi blamed his inability to fend off Schumacher on his worn tyres, which had completed half a race distance as opposed to Schumacher&#x27;s fresher set and on being held up by Häkkinen and Brundle&#x27;s battle for seventh position in the closing laps. Alesi was also given the instruction to save fuel with 15 laps to go, suggesting that his one-stop strategy was the incorrect choice.

On 2 November 1995, the FIA announced that none of the drivers who took part in the anti-doping tests at the Portuguese and European Grands Prix had tested positive, including Barrichello and Papis. However, FIA Formula One Safety and Medical Delegate, Professor Sid Watkins, subsequently argued that as ephedrine had no effect on a driver&#x27;s ability, the sport should not use exactly the same list as the International Olympic Committee in the future.

<text>The 1995 Pacific Grand Prix (formally the II Pacific Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 22 October 1995 at the TI Circuit, Aida, Japan. It was the fifteenth round of the 1995 Formula One World Championship. Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team won the 83-lap race starting from third position. David Coulthard, who started the Grand Prix from pole position, finished second in a Williams car, with Damon Hill third in the other Williams. Schumacher&#x27;s win confirmed him as 1995 Drivers&#x27; Champion, as Hill could not pass Schumacher&#x27;s points total with only two races remaining. This was also the last race for Jean-Christophe Boullion.

Hill started the race alongside Coulthard on the front row, amidst pressure from the British media for not being &quot;forceful&quot; enough in battles. Schumacher attempted to drive around the outside of Hill at the first corner, but Hill held Schumacher off as Jean Alesi, driving for Ferrari, got past both on the inside line to take second position. As a result, Hill dropped down to third and Schumacher dropped down to fifth behind Gerhard Berger. Schumacher then managed to get past Alesi and Hill during the first of three pit stops. This allowed him, on a new set of slick tyres, to close on Coulthard who was on a two-stop strategy. Schumacher opened up a gap of 21 seconds by lapping two seconds faster per lap than Coulthard, so that when his third stop came, he still led the race.

==Background==
The race, originally scheduled to be held as the third round of the season on 16 April 1995, was moved to October as the local infrastructure and communications were badly damaged from the Great Hanshin earthquake.

Heading into the 15th race of the season, Benetton driver Michael Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 82 points; Williams driver Damon Hill was second on 55 points, 27 points behind Schumacher. A maximum of 30 points were available for the remaining three races, which meant that Hill could still win the title. Schumacher only needed a fourth-place finish to become Drivers&#x27; Champion as, even if Hill won, Schumacher would be more than 20 points ahead of Hill with two races remaining. Behind Hill and Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, David Coulthard was third on 43 points in a Williams, with Johnny Herbert and Jean Alesi both on 40 points. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Benetton were leading on 112 points and Williams were second on 92 points, with a maximum of 48 points available. In the two weeks leading up to the race, there was heavy criticism towards Damon Hill, with pundits feeling that Hill had not been &quot;forceful&quot; enough in his battle at the against Schumacher. In an interview leading up to the race, part-time Ligier driver Martin Brundle said:


Schumacher, his title-rival, said that Hill made &quot;half-hearted attempts&quot; to overtake, which led to him &quot;getting into trouble&quot;. The comments were prompted after a series of battles between Hill and Schumacher in previous race meetings, most notably at the , where Hill accused Schumacher of blocking him. At a Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) World Motor Sport Council meeting on October 19 to discuss driver etiquette, they opted against introducing new rules on the issue. Formula One&#x27;s governing body emphasised that the International Sporting Code would be enforced on the basis that drivers are free to drive as they wish &quot;provided they do not deliberately endanger another driver or repeatedly obstruct him on a straight&quot;, following incidents during the year involving Hill and Schumacher.

Williams were favourites to win the race due to the nature of the track—their Williams FW17 car was more suited to high-downforce tracks like Aida, and thus had the advantage over Benetton. In an attempt to match the pace of the Williams cars, Benetton introduced a revised rear suspension geometry to the Benetton B195 for the race.

There were five driver changes heading into the race. Having been in one of the two Ligier cars since the tenth race of the season at Germany, Martin Brundle was replaced by Aguri Suzuki as part of the two sharing the drive for the season. Jan Magnussen was drafted into the McLaren team to replace Mika Häkkinen because of the Finn&#x27;s operation for appendicitis. The third driver change was Ukyo Katayama&#x27;s return to Tyrrell after missing the European Grand Prix due to a crash at the . Gianni Morbidelli returned to the Footwork team replacing Max Papis, while at Pacific, Bertrand Gachot came back to replace Jean-Denis Délétraz, both men having driven for these teams at the start of the season. Délétraz was replaced as he had not made agreed payment instalments to the Pacific team for the privilege of the drive. Pacific had originally intended to run local driver Katsumi Yamamoto in place of Délétraz, but he was not granted an FIA Super Licence and so Gachot retook the seat. Similarly, the Forti team&#x27;s plans to replace Roberto Moreno with Hideki Noda came to nought for the same reason, even though Noda had started three Grands Prix for the Larrousse team the previous year.

==Practice and qualifying==
Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout. Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session, posting a lap of 1:16.057, three-tenths of a second quicker than Hill and Coulthard, in second and third places respectively. The Ferrari cars were fourth and fifth fastest; Gerhard Berger ahead of Jean Alesi, with McLaren driver Mark Blundell rounding out the top six. Coulthard lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session with a time of 1:15.730. Hill was second in the Williams, three-tenths of a second behind Coulthard. Eddie Irvine in the Jordan car was fourth, seven-tenths behind Coulthard. He was split by the Ferrari cars who were third and fifth; Alesi in front of Berger. The Benetton cars were sixth and seventh; Schumacher in front of Herbert. Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jean-Christophe Boullion were eighth and tenth in the Sauber cars, with Rubens Barrichello ninth in the Jordan, two seconds off the pace.

The qualifying session was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon. The fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final grid position. Coulthard clinched his fourth consecutive pole position, in his Williams, with a time of 1:14.013. He was joined on the front row by teammate Hill, who was two-tenths of a second behind. Schumacher was third in the Benetton, edging closer to the Williams drivers throughout both days of qualifying by steadily reducing the downforce on his car. His last run, right at the end of the second session, pressured Coulthard into leaving the pit lane to cover the German. The pole position man thus used an additional set of slick tyres, meaning that out of the allocation of seven sets of slick tyres as set out by the FIA, he had only two sets of brand-new rubber for the race, whereas Schumacher had the advantage of three sets of new rubber. Hill, concerned about starting from the dirty side of the track (the side of the track that is opposite to the racing line), had only two sets of brand new tyres for the race.

Berger took fourth despite going off into the gravel late in the second part of qualifying. Berger&#x27;s teammate Alesi was fifth, with Irvine completing the top six for his best qualifying position of the season. Rookie Magnussen qualified 12th, only two places behind teammate Blundell, after not making a mistake in either of the two sessions. Returning drivers Suzuki, Katayama, Morbidelli and Gachot qualified 13th, 17th, 19th and 24th respectively, with the grid covered by 7.392 seconds.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 09:30 JST (GMT +9) for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard had the fastest time of 1:16.831. Hill was third in the other Williams car; Boullion split them in the Sauber for second position. Olivier Panis completed the top four in a Ligier car, eight-tenths of a second behind Hill. Hill drove the spare Williams car along the inside of the start–finish straight in an effort to clean up his grid position on the dusty side of the track. Schumacher finished the session in eighth, despite going off the track, damaging his race car in the process.

==Race==
The conditions for the race were dry with the air temperature . The remote and inaccessible nature of the circuit and the fact that the took place just one week later resulted in a meagre race-day crowd of only 15,000 spectators. The race started at 14:00 JST. Coulthard, from pole position on the grid, held onto the lead into the first corner. Hill, who started alongside Coulthard, had a bad start. Schumacher attempted to go around the outside of Hill at the first corner, but Hill held Schumacher off. Both drivers ran off the racing line in the process, allowing Alesi through into second place. At the end of lap one, Coulthard led Alesi by 2.8 seconds, with Hill a further three-tenths back. Berger was fourth, with Schumacher demoted to fifth. Bertrand Gachot in the Pacific became the first person to retire from the race with a gearbox problem on lap two. He was followed by Suzuki and Boullion, who both spun off the track and were unable to continue. Boullion blamed his spin on Minardi driver Pedro Lamy, whom he accused of weaving in front of him. Schumacher passed Berger for fourth position on lap five, and immediately began closing on Hill in third, who himself was only a few tenths behind Alesi. Schumacher attempted to pass Hill on lap 11 for third place at the hairpin, but Hill held him off. As Hill and Schumacher were held up by the slower Ferrari cars, Coulthard pulled away by more than a second a lap in the first eight laps. By lap 18, Coulthard&#x27;s gap to second place was 14 seconds, and it appeared that he would win the race comfortably.

Alesi, Hill and Schumacher all made pit stops for their first of three stops on lap 18. The Benetton pitcrew made a quick stop for Schumacher, allowing him to get out ahead of Alesi and Hill. Hill lost additional time with a sticking refuelling valve, causing his stop to last almost twice as long as Schumacher&#x27;s. Schumacher exited the pit stop in fourth place (behind Coulthard, and the yet-to-stop Berger and Herbert), with Alesi in seventh place (split from Schumacher by Irvine) and Hill in tenth place (separated from Alesi by Frentzen and Blundell). With Alesi and Hill held up by the slower runners on two-stop strategies in front, Schumacher pulled away and closed in on Coulthard. Blundell made a pit stop on the next lap, and Hill passed Frentzen on lap 22. On the following lap, Alesi passed Irvine at the hairpin; Hill tried to follow Alesi through but his front wing hit the rear of Irvine&#x27;s car, causing minor damage. Irvine made a pit stop at the end of lap 25, allowing Hill to resume his chase of Alesi unimpeded. Like his teammate, Coulthard was scheduled to make three stops, but his pit strategy was changed to make only two by staying out six laps longer than originally scheduled, and then taking onboard more fuel than first planned at his first stop on lap 24. As a result of a lighter fuel load for Schumacher because of the different strategies, Schumacher began to consistently lap faster than the Scotsman.

Schumacher made his second stop on lap 38, and came out of the pit lane just in front of third-placed Alesi, but over twenty seconds behind Coulthard. Schumacher immediately began setting fastest laps and began to close in on Coulthard once more. Hill managed to move up to third, in front of Alesi, during their second pit stops on laps 38 and 39 respectively. The Ferrari of Alesi then dropped further back as teammate Berger passed him at the hairpin for fourth position on lap 45. Coulthard made his second and final stop for new tyres on lap 49; exiting 14 seconds behind Schumacher, who continued to extend the margin between the two. Coulthard was unable to capitalise on the performance advantage offered by the new tyres after the stop due to lapped traffic getting in his way. The German made his third and final pit stop on lap 60 with a 21-second advantage, exiting in front of Coulthard to lead the race. Schumacher opened the gap to 15 seconds, and won the race after 83 laps to secure his eighth victory of the season in a time of 1:48:49.972s. Schumacher was crowned the 1995 Drivers&#x27; Champion as Hill could not catch his points total with two races remaining. He also became the youngest double Drivers&#x27; Champion in Formula One history. Coulthard finished second in his Williams, 14 seconds behind Schumacher, with teammate Hill third. The Ferrari cars of Berger and Alesi were fourth and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Berger suffered from a misfiring engine throughout the race. Herbert took the final point in sixth place for Benetton, ahead of Frentzen, Panis and Blundell. Throughout the race, Barrichello and Magnussen engaged in a battle for tenth and eleventh positions, with Magnussen keeping Barrichello behind until lap 37 when the Brazilian managed to overtake him into the hairpin. Magnussen finished in tenth place, but Barrichello subsequently retired on lap 67 with an engine problem. Magnussen&#x27;s first race was described as &quot;highly accomplished&quot; by the year&#x27;s &quot;Autocourse&quot; annual. After his impressive qualifying performance, Irvine was heading for eighth place, but made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 72 and dropped to eleventh. The attrition rate was low, with 17 of the 24 starters finishing the race.

==Post-race==
After the race, it was revealed that Schumacher endured a downshift problem after his final stop, and that he was lucky to complete the final lap as warning lights had activated on his steering wheel. Schumacher praised his pitcrew for doing a &quot;perfect&quot; first stop which helped him move in front of Alesi and Hill. He said he &quot;never saw anything like this team and its ability to come up with strategies&quot; and that they never made &quot;one mistake this season&quot;. Off-camera while going through parc fermé, Schumacher and Hill renewed their argument from the Belgian Grand Prix over what degree of blocking was acceptable after their first corner incident. Schumacher told Hill that he was unhappy with Hill&#x27;s driving throughout the race, most notably during Schumacher&#x27;s overtaking attempts on lap one and lap eleven where Schumacher felt Hill had &quot;brake tested&quot; him. Hill refuted Schumacher&#x27;s claims, saying:

Despite Hill&#x27;s comments, he endured continued criticism by the British media after the poor performance; speculation brewed that Williams were going to replace him with Frentzen for the 1996 season. Despite the rumours, Williams team boss Frank Williams gave Hill &quot;an unequivocal vote of confidence&quot; heading into the next race, the Japanese Grand Prix. Schumacher subsequently changed his opinion of the incident after watching video footage prior to the Japanese race and no longer blamed Hill for it.

During an interview Coulthard, who finished second, revealed that it was his decision to change to a two-stop strategy from a three-stop strategy, telling the Williams pitcrew to delay his stop. Afterwards, he said that in hindsight he would have stayed on a three-stop strategy, and wished he could &quot;blame someone else for this decision, but I can&#x27;t&quot;. The 1995 race was the last held at the Aida circuit, and the last Formula One race to date held under the Pacific Grand Prix banner, with the manager of the TI Circuit unable to keep the venue financially profitable.

<text>The 1995 Japanese Grand Prix (formally the XXI Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Suzuka Circuit, Suzuka on 29 October 1995. It was the sixteenth and penultimate race of the 1995 Formula One World Championship. The 53-lap race was won from pole position by German Michael Schumacher, driving a Benetton-Renault, with Finn Mika Häkkinen second in a McLaren-Mercedes and Schumacher&#x27;s British teammate Johnny Herbert third.

Jean Alesi, driving for Ferrari, started second, alongside Schumacher. However, Alesi was forced to serve a 10-second stop-and-go penalty because his car moved forward before the start. Alesi climbed back up to second, before retiring on lap 25. Schumacher&#x27;s rival in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Damon Hill, started fourth amidst pressure from the British media after poor performances at previous races. Hill moved up to second because of Alesi&#x27;s retirement, but spun off the track on lap 40.

Schumacher&#x27;s win was his ninth of the season, matching the record set in by Nigel Mansell. Benetton was confirmed Constructors&#x27; Champions as Williams could not pass its points total in the one remaining race.

==Background==
Heading into the penultimate race of the season, Benetton driver Michael Schumacher had already won the season&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship, having clinched the title at the previous race, the . Schumacher led the championship with 92 points; Damon Hill was second with 59 points. A maximum of 20 points were available for the remaining two races, which meant that Hill could not catch Schumacher. Although the Drivers&#x27; Championship was decided, the Constructors&#x27; Championship was not. Benetton were leading on 123 points and Williams were second with 102 points heading into the 16th race, with a maximum of 32 points available. In the week leading up to the race, Hill was criticised by the British media after poor performances in previous races; there was continued speculation that Williams were going to replace him with Heinz-Harald Frentzen or Gerhard Berger for the 1996 season. Despite the rumours, Williams team boss Frank Williams gave Hill &quot;an unequivocal vote of confidence&quot; heading into the race.
There were two driver changes heading into the race. Having been in one of the two Sauber cars since the fifth race of the season at Monaco, Jean-Christophe Boullion was released from the team and replaced by Karl Wendlinger. The Austrian was given another chance to prove himself after suffering an accident at the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix, which left him in a coma for weeks. The second driver change was Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s return to McLaren after missing the Pacific Grand Prix because of an operation for appendicitis.

==Practice and qualifying==
Two practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Saturday morning. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout. Schumacher was fastest in the first session, posting a time of 1:40.410, two-tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen. The Williams and Ferrari cars occupied the remaining top six positions; Williams drivers Hill and David Coulthard third and fifth respectively. The Ferrari cars were fourth and sixth fastest; Jean Alesi ahead of Berger. Häkkinen lapped faster than Schumacher in the second practice session with a time of 1:40.389. Eddie Irvine took second place in the Jordan car, three-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen. Hill was third in the Williams, two-tenths behind Häkkinen, with Schumacher fourth behind Hill. The Ferrari cars were fifth and eighth; Alesi in front of Berger. Frentzen&#x27;s Sauber and Coulthard&#x27;s Williams split the Ferrari drivers. Despite both the Williams cars going off into the gravel, Hill and Coulthard made the top 10.

The qualifying session was split into two one-hour sessions; the first was held on Friday afternoon with the second held on Saturday afternoon. The fastest time from either sessions counted towards their final grid position. Schumacher clinched his tenth career pole position, in his Benetton B195, with a time of 1:38.023. He was joined on the front row by Alesi, who was eight-tenths of a second behind. Schumacher was particularly pleased with the performance of his Benetton, saying that &quot;I have rarely had such a good car ... I think I can be confident for the race&quot;. Alesi was satisfied about his performance, but worried about a mechanical problem which had caused him to crash on Friday, accusing the Ferrari team of withholding information from him. Alesi was scheduled to leave Ferrari for Benetton in a swap with Schumacher at the end of the season, and the relationship between him and the team was becoming increasingly strained. Häkkinen was third in the McLaren, with Hill fourth, a second slower than Schumacher. Despite Häkkinen&#x27;s best qualifying effort of the season alongside his Belgium third place, his teammate, Mark Blundell, had a disappointing qualifying session. In the first part of qualifying, Blundell crashed into the wall, meaning he could not set a time as his car was too badly damaged. Blundell had his second crash of the weekend at the 130R corner in Saturday practice, which was more serious than the first. Following medical advice, Blundell did not participate in the second qualifying session. He was unable to set a time, leaving him at the back of the grid. Aguri Suzuki crashed his Ligier during Saturday qualifying; he was unable to start the race since he was in a hospital with a broken rib.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
The drivers took to the track at 09:30 JST (GMT +9) for a 30-minute warmup session. Despite underperforming in qualifying, both Williams cars performed better in the wet weather warmup session; Hill had the fastest time of 2:00.025. Coulthard was third in the other Williams car; Schumacher split them in second position. Alesi completed the top four, eight-tenths of a second behind Hill.

==Race==
The track surface was damp for most of the race, which meant that lap times were slower than the previous days&#x27; qualifying sessions. Though 24 cars qualified for the race, only 22 took the start: Suzuki was unable to start because of his crash in qualifying and Roberto Moreno&#x27;s Forti car suffered a gearbox problem. For the first time since the Japanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka in 1987, tickets for the race did not sell out, despite the fact that three Japanese drivers entered the race.

The race started at 14:00 JST. All of the drivers opted to start on wet-weather tyres as the track was damp from the morning rain. Schumacher, from pole position on the grid, held onto the lead into the first corner. Alesi, who started alongside Schumacher, was judged to have jumped the start, and served a 10-second stop-and-go penalty on lap three, from which he returned to the race in tenth place. Alesi&#x27;s teammate Berger also jumped the start and received the same penalty. Gianni Morbidelli, near the back of the field in one of the Footwork cars, spun at the first corner on lap one after being hit from behind by Wendlinger&#x27;s Sauber. Morbidelli stalled his car in the process, forcing him to retire from the race. On lap seven, Alesi stopped at the pits to change to dry weather slick tyres, as the track was beginning to dry. On returning to the race, he began to make his way through the field constantly recording fastest laps; the first of which was 1:54.416, five seconds faster than the remainder of the field. Schumacher made a pit stop on lap 10 for slicks, handing the lead to Häkkinen for a lap before he too pitted. Alesi&#x27;s progress was interrupted when he spun attempting to pass Pedro Lamy&#x27;s Minardi for 15th place, but he made his way up to second by lap 10, overtaking Hill around the outside in the final chicane to take the place. Alerted by Alesi&#x27;s pace on the slick tyres, the other drivers came into the pits to change to slick tyres.

The two Jordan cars collided on lap 15. Rubens Barrichello spun in the final chicane when he attempted to brake later than his teammate Irvine. Barrichello hit a wall, which damaged his car&#x27;s rear wing and caused him to retire from the race. Irvine was involved in another collision at the chicane on lap 20 when Frentzen hit him from behind. Irvine continued without damage, but Frentzen had to pit for a new front wing. At the front, Alesi was lapping faster than Schumacher, even though Schumacher was on dry tyres. Alesi was only six seconds behind Schumacher when his Ferrari 412T2 suffered an apparent differential failure on lap 25. It was later discovered that the problem was a driveshaft failure, possibly as a result of his earlier spin. Schumacher made a pit stop for a second time on lap 31, returning to the race in second place behind Hill. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race on lap 33, and regained his lead on the next lap when Hill made his pit stop. Behind them, Häkkinen and Coulthard were third and fourth respectively before their pit stops, but Coulthard pitted six laps later than Häkkinen and returned to the track in third place, one place ahead of the Finn. Johnny Herbert was fifth in the second Benetton car after the second round of pit stops, with Irvine rounding out the point-scoring places in sixth.

At this stage, the rain began to fall again, but only at the Spoon Curve end of the track. The Williams drivers were second and third until Hill ran off the track at Spoon Curve two laps after his pit stop. He damaged his front wing in the process and returned to the track in fourth. Hill returned to the pits to let his pit crew replace the damaged wing. He rejoined fifth, but was then given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for speeding in the pitlane. Coulthard made the same mistake as his teammate by running through the gravel trap at the Spoon Curve but looked like he was going to escape with only minor damage. However, as he braked for 130R, the next corner, the gravel which had entered his sidepods flew out, causing him to lose control and get his car stuck in the gravel trap. Hill was told by his team on the radio to speed up as he had not yet taken his stop-and-go penalty, but later that lap he spun off at Spoon Curve and retired from the race without having taken the penalty. Blundell, Irvine and Frentzen also left the track at Spoon Curve but all finished the race. With his closest challenger out, Schumacher won the race after 53 laps to secure his ninth victory of the season in a time of 1:36:52.930. The win, along with Herbert&#x27;s third place and the retirements of Hill and Coulthard, gave Benetton the 1995 Constructors&#x27; Championship. Häkkinen finished second in his McLaren, 20 seconds behind Schumacher. Irvine was fourth in his Jordan with Olivier Panis fifth in his Ligier. Mika Salo took sixth place and the final point in his Tyrrell. Despite starting last, Blundell finished in seventh, just 1.6 seconds behind Salo. The delayed Frentzen, Luca Badoer, Wendlinger, Lamy and Taki Inoue completed the finishers.

==Post-race==
This was Schumacher&#x27;s last win for Benetton, as he moved to the Ferrari team for the 1996 season. Herbert reiterated Schumacher&#x27;s opinion by stating that Benetton did &quot;a fantastic job&quot;. Hill was disappointed about the race and the season as a whole; he said afterwards:

As a result of Hill not taking his 10-second stop-and-go penalty because of his retirement, Williams were fined $10,000 by Formula One&#x27;s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA). In an interview with &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine in 2008, Hill said that the 1995 season, as a whole, &quot;went down, mentally, and it all just got to me&quot;. He also said he believed that it was in 1995 that Frank Williams and Patrick Head decided to replace him for the 1997 season.

1980 Formula One World Champion Alan Jones praised Alesi&#x27;s performance, saying that it &quot;will go down as one of the great drives in Grand Prix racing&quot;. Alesi stated that if his driveshaft had not failed, he would &quot;have fought for it, all the way to the end&quot;. Alesi added that he believed he did not jump the start, but admitted that &quot;the car crept forwards by a few centimetres&quot; because of the downhill slope of the grid. In an interview with &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine in 2009, Alesi said that he went to see the race director before the race to see how he could avoid a penalty at the downhill start and that he was &quot;totally fed up&quot; with the penalty decision given. Berger also questioned his penalty, claiming that his car did not move before the green light went on. Alesi has mentioned several times that this was &quot;the race of my life&quot;.

<text>The 1995 Australian Grand Prix (officially the LX [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 November 1995 at the Adelaide Street Circuit, Adelaide. The race, contested over 81 laps, was the seventeenth and final race of the 1995 Formula One season, and the eleventh and last Australian Grand Prix to be held at Adelaide before the event moved to Melbourne the following year. This would also prove to be the last Grand Prix for Mark Blundell, Bertrand Gachot, Roberto Moreno, Taki Inoue, and Karl Wendlinger. This was also the last race for Pacific as they folded at the end of the season.

In a race of attrition, all the front-running cars retired except for the pole-sitting Williams-Renault of Damon Hill. Hill won by two clear laps, only the second time this had been achieved in Formula One history. Ligier-Mugen-Honda driver Olivier Panis was second, with Gianni Morbidelli achieving his best-ever F1 result with third in a Footwork-Hart. Of the 23 drivers who started, only eight finished, the lowest number in the 1995 season. , this is the last time the race winner lapped every other competitor. This was also the last race that used the traffic light system with coloured lights (red and green) at the start (system used since the 1975 British Grand Prix).

The Grand Prix had a record attendance of 520,000 during the weekend, with 210,000 on race day, a Formula One record until , when 250,000 people attended that year&#x27;s United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis.

== Report ==

=== Pre-race ===
Heading into the final round of the 1995 Formula One season, both the Drivers&#x27; Championship and Constructors&#x27; Championship were already settled, with Michael Schumacher having claimed the Drivers&#x27; Championship two rounds earlier at the Pacific Grand Prix. It was Schumacher&#x27;s last race with the Benetton team, before his move to Ferrari for the 1996 season. Benetton had claimed the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the previous event, the Japanese Grand Prix, with Williams too many points behind to be able to catch them. It was announced beforehand that it would be the last Formula One event to be held at the Adelaide Street Circuit, with the Australian Grand Prix moving to Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit in Melbourne from the 1996 season.

In the Friday afternoon qualifying session, Mika Häkkinen in his McLaren car suffered a puncture in his left rear tyre heading towards Brewery Bend. This caused him to lose control, become airborne and crash heavily into a tyre barrier at 120 mph. The impact caused his helmet to strike the steering wheel, fracturing his skull. Within seconds he was attended by two doctors who were stationed at the corner, who found Hakkinen unresponsive and with a blocked airway. Häkkinen later said that he was aware of what had happened immediately after the impact, but subsequently lost consciousness. Unable to establish an airway, the doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy before taking him to the nearby Royal Adelaide Hospital. Häkkinen would recover in time to race the following season.

The Williams cars dominated qualifying, with Damon Hill in pole position and David Coulthard alongside him. Schumacher was third in his Benetton, with the Ferrari drivers fourth and fifth, Gerhard Berger ahead of Jean Alesi. Heinz-Harald Frentzen rounded out the top six in his Sauber.

=== Race ===
The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 ACDT (UTC+10:30). Hill lost the lead to Coulthard at the start. Schumacher also lost ground at the start, with Berger moving into third and Alesi moving into fourth. Schumacher made his way back up to third, overtaking Alesi on lap one, before overtaking Berger a few laps later. Coulthard kept the lead until the first round of pitstops. However, he came into the pitlane too fast, locking his front tyres and running into the pitwall. He was forced to retire from the race. A few laps later, Forti&#x27;s Roberto Moreno had spun and caused terminal damage to his suspension in the same place where Coulthard had crashed earlier.

After the first round of pitstops, Schumacher and Alesi collided, with both retiring. Schumacher&#x27;s Benetton team-mate, Johnny Herbert took second place briefly before coming in for his first stop later than many of the other drivers, while surviving a potential accident in which he missed the pit entry and rejoined the track. Berger was promoted to second, but his Ferrari encountered an engine problem, forcing him to retire. This promoted Frentzen to second, but he too retired due to a gearbox problem. With many of the front-runners out, Hill led at the front, even with a 22-second botched pit stop, with Herbert second. Jordan driver Eddie Irvine rounded out the top three, before retiring after losing all of his pneumatic pressure. Herbert was still second, and looked set as a result to claim third place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. However, he was forced out of the race as his Benetton suffered a driveshaft failure. Olivier Panis was now second in his Ligier a lap behind Hill, with Footwork driver Gianni Morbidelli third, two laps down. With a few laps remaining, Panis&#x27; Ligier was suffering an oil leak, and Hill lapped him for a second time on his way to victory. Panis remained second, with Morbidelli third for his only career podium, and the first podium for the Footwork/Arrows team in six years. Behind the top three, Mark Blundell was fourth in the sole McLaren, with Mika Salo fifth in the Tyrrell. Pedro Lamy had a mid-race spin, but recovered to take sixth in his Minardi – his only Formula One point, and Minardi&#x27;s last until the 1999 European Grand Prix. Only eight cars finished the race, with Pedro Diniz seventh place being Forti&#x27;s best Formula One finish. The eighth place for Pacific also equalled their best result since the 1995 German Grand Prix. The race was televised by Channel 9 in Australia and by the BBC in the UK.

The race marked the end of Pacific Racing, as the team went back to International Formula 3000 for 1996. In a last gasp effort, Pacific tried to have their test driver Oliver Gavin in the seat, but he was not granted an FIA Super License and shareholder Bertrand Gachot raced instead. It was only the second time in Formula One history that the winner won by two laps– the first time was at the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix when Jackie Stewart won. Hill, who had been criticised for his performances in all of the three previous races, was praised by commentator Murray Walker for this performance, with Walker saying that, with Schumacher and Coulthard&#x27;s imminent moves to Ferrari and McLaren respectively, Hill would be a strong favourite to win the title in 1996 if he could continue to perform in the way he had done so in this particular race. This would also be the last race for a V12 engine. Only Ferrari used this configuration, but would switch to a more fuel-efficient V10 engine for 1996.

Although he failed to finish, by competing in the race Gerhard Berger became the only driver to have driven in all 11 Formula One Grands Prix held in Adelaide. He had driven for Arrows-BMW (1985), Benetton-BMW (1986), Ferrari (1987, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1995) and McLaren-Honda (1990, 1991, 1992), winning the race for Ferrari in 1987 (as well as claiming pole position and fastest lap) and McLaren in 1992.

The post-race concert was headlined by American rock band Bon Jovi, who performed at the Victoria Park Racecourse as part of their These Days Tour.

<doc id="1123261" wikidata="Q1607300" url="?curid=1123261" title="Henry Tandey">
<text>Lance Corporal Henry James Tandey VC, DCM, MM (born Tandy, 30 August 1891 – 20 December 1977) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the second most highly decorated British private of the First World War and is most commonly remembered as the soldier who allegedly spared Adolf Hitler&#x27;s life during the first world war. Born with the family name of Tandy, he later changed his surname to Tandey after problems with his father, and because of this, some military records have a different spelling of his name.

==Early life==
Henry James Tandey was born at the Angel Hotel, Regent Street, Leamington, Warwickshire, the son of a former soldier whose wife had died early in their child&#x27;s life. He attended St Peter&#x27;s primary school in Augusta Place, Leamington. He also spent part of his childhood in an orphanage before becoming a boiler attendant at a hotel.

==Military service==
Tandey enlisted into the Green Howards on 12 August 1910. After basic training he was posted to the 2nd Battalion of the regiment on 23 January 1911, serving with them in Guernsey and South Africa prior to the outbreak of World War I. He took part in the Battle of Ypres in October 1914, and was wounded on 24 October 1916, at the Battle of the Somme. On discharge from hospital he was posted to the 3rd Battalion on 5 May 1917, before moving to the 9th Battalion on 11 June 1917. He was wounded a second time on 27 November 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele. After his second period of hospital treatment he returned to the 3rd Battalion, on 23 January 1918, before being posted to the 12th Battalion on 15 March 1918, where he remained until 26 July 1918. On 26 July 1918 Tandey transferred from the Green Howards to The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding Regiment). He was posted to their 5th Battalion on 27 July 1918.

===Distinguished Conduct Medal===
On 28 August 1918, during the Second Battle of Cambrai, the 5th Battalion was in action to the west of the Canal du Nord. Tandey was in charge of one of several bombing parties on the German trenches. As the forward parties were being held up Tandey took two men and dashed across open ground (No man&#x27;s land) under fire and bombed a trench. He returned with twenty prisoners. This action led to the capture of the German positions and Tandey was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) on 5 December 1918, the citation read:

On 12 September, the 5th Battalion was involved in an attack at Havrincourt, where Tandey again distinguished himself. Having rescued several wounded men under fire the previous day, Tandey again led a bombing party into the German trenches, returning with more prisoners. For this action Tandey was awarded the Military Medal (MM) on 13 March 1919.

===Victoria Cross===
Tandey was 27 years old and a private in the 5th Battalion Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding) Regiment when he performed the actions which earned him the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 28 September 1918, during a counter-attack at the canal, following the capture of Marcoing, France, his platoon was stopped by machine-gun fire. Tandey crawled forward, located the gun position and with a Lewis gun team, silenced it. Reaching the canal crossing, he restored the plank bridge under heavy fire. In the evening, he and eight comrades were surrounded by an overwhelming number of the enemy. Tandey led a bayonet charge, fighting so fiercely that 37 of the enemy were driven into the hands of the remainder of his company. Although twice wounded, Tandey refused to leave until the fight was won, eventually going into hospital for the third time on 4 October 1918.

An eyewitness, Private H Lister, recounted the episode:

His VC was gazetted on 14 December 1918, the citation read:

===Alleged encounter with Adolf Hitler===
Although disputed, Tandey allegedly encountered Adolf Hitler at the French village of Marcoing on 28 September 1918, while Tandey was serving with the 5th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment. That day, Tandey took part in a battle for which he would be awarded the VC for bravery. As the battle neared its end, a wounded German soldier wandered into Tandey&#x27;s line of fire and he chose not to shoot. The German soldier saw him lower his rifle and nodded his thanks before wandering off. Although Tandey reputedly commonly spared wounded and disarmed German soldiers, the soldier from that day is dubiously claimed to have been Hitler. Hitler, however, took his second leave from military service from 10–28 September 1918, indicating that he was still in Germany at the time. Tandey was decorated with the VC in late 1919, after which reports of the ceremony circulated with a picture of Tandey carrying a wounded soldier during the First Battle of Ypres (1914), which Hitler may have become aware of.

In 1923, the Green Howards Regiment commissioned a painting from Fortunino Matania, showing a soldier purported to be Tandey carrying a wounded man at the Kruiseke Crossroads (northwest of Menin) in 1914. The painting was made from a sketch, provided to Matania by the regiment, based on an event at that crossroads. A building shown behind Tandey in the painting belonged to the Van Den Broucke family, to whom the regiment presented a copy of the painting.

In 1937, Hitler became aware of the Matania painting, a copy of it being owned by Dr. Otto Schwend, a member of Hitler&#x27;s staff. Schwend had been a medical officer during the 1914 Battle of Ypres and in 1936 had been sent a copy of the painting by a Lieutenant Colonel Earle, whom Schwend had treated in a medical post at the Menin Crossroads; the pair stayed in touch after the war. Schwend gave a large photograph of the painting to Hitler, who purportedly identified the soldier carrying the wounded man as Tandey from the photo of him in the 1918 newspaper. Hitler&#x27;s adjutant, Captain Fritz Wiedemann, wrote Schwend in response:

In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain visited Hitler at the Berghof for talks that led to the Munich Agreement, noticed the painting and asked about it. Hitler replied: That man came so near to killing me that I thought I should never see Germany again; Providence saved me from such devilishly accurate fire as those English boys were aiming at us.

Hitler reputedly asked Chamberlain to give Tandey his best wishes and gratitude. Chamberlain promised to phone Tandey upon his return. Supposedly, the phone was answered by the nine-year-old William Whateley, a relative of Tandey&#x27;s wife Edith. The records related to the 1938 meeting at the Cadbury Research Centre (which holds copies of Chamberlain&#x27;s papers and diaries) do not reference Tandey, who at the time lived at 22 Cope Street, Coventry, and worked for the Triumph Motor Company. Neither that company nor British Telecommunications record a telephone line registered to Tandey&#x27;s address in 1938.

===Post-war service===
On 13 March 1919 a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; announced that Tandey had been awarded the Military Medal (MM). The following day he was discharged from service and only one day later he re-enlisted into the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s 3rd Battalion on a &#x27;Short Service Engagement&#x27;. Three days later (18 March 1919) he was promoted to acting lance corporal. He remained with the 3rd Battalion on &#x27;Home Service&#x27; until 4 February 1921, when he transferred to the 2nd Battalion. Four days later on 8 February 1921 he requested to revert to the rank of private.

Tandey served with the 2nd Battalion in Gibraltar from 11 April 1922 to 18 February 1923, in Turkey from 19 February – 23 August 1923 and finally in Egypt from 24 August 1923 until 29 September 1925. He was finally discharged from the army on 5 January 1926.

In addition to his major awards Tandey had also been Mentioned in Despatches on five occasions. He was personally decorated by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 17 December 1919.

==Post-war years==

Tandey returned to Leamington Spa and married. In 1940, during the Coventry Blitz, his home was bombed by the Luftwaffe. Tandey is reported to have rescued many people from their burning homes during the Blitz of Coventry. Often carrying people out of the homes over his shoulder. A journalist approached him outside his bombed Coventry home, asking him about his alleged encounter with Hitler. &quot;If only I had known what he would turn out to be,&quot; Tandey is quoted as saying. &quot;When I saw all the people and women and children he had killed and wounded I was sorry to God I let him go.&quot; However, there is no evidence, not even anecdotal, he was either hounded or avoided after the claims.

Tandey became a commissionaire at the Standard Triumph Works, Fletchamstead a position he held for 38 years.

Tandey died in 1977, childless, at the age of 86. At his request, he was cremated and his ashes buried in the Masnieres British Cemetery at Marcoing, France, on 23 May 1978, by his undertaker Pargetter and Son. Due to French laws it was not permissible for his ashes to be scattered, or any form of ceremony or commemoration made to him.

Henry Tandey Court, on Union Road, in Leamington Spa, is named after him. It was originally a workshop and builders yard of Mr. G.F.Smith, who built St. Marks Church and Vicarage.

A blue plaque was installed outside the Angel Hotel where Henry Tandey was born and at St Peter&#x27;s School.

==Medals==
Tandey donated his medals to the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment Museum in Halifax, West Yorkshire. On special occasions and parades he would sign them out to wear. During the last period that he had signed them out, he died. Unaware that the medals should have been returned to the museum, the medals were auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in London by his wife and a private collector subsequently purchased them. They were presented to the Green Howards Regimental Museum (the regiment in which he had earlier served), by Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, at a ceremony in the Tower of London on 11 November 1997, twenty years after Tandey died.

A copy of Tandey&#x27;s Victoria Cross is now displayed at the Green Howards Regimental Museum in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Along with others, the original VC is kept in a local bank vault.

On 6 June 2006 The Green Howards and the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding) Regiment amalgamated with the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire to form the Yorkshire Regiment.

<text>The 1996 Australian Grand Prix (officially the 1996 Transurban Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Melbourne on 10 March 1996. It was the first race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship, and the first Australian Grand Prix to be held at Melbourne, taking over from Adelaide.

The 58-lap race was won by Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. Hill&#x27;s teammate Jacques Villeneuve, making his Formula One debut, took pole position and led for most of the race, before an oil leak enabled Hill to catch and pass him in the closing laps. Eddie Irvine finished third in a Ferrari.

== Report ==

===Background===

This was the second Grand Prix in a row held in Australia, the previous race being the conclusion to the 1995 season.

Taki Inoue was scheduled to race for the Minardi team as a pay driver but when no money materialised prior to the race he was replaced by Giancarlo Fisichella. Marlboro had expressed interest in Fisichella running early on.

The race was the first to use the new race-start system, still used in Formula 1 today, replacing the old red to green light system. Under the new system, five red lights would come on at one second intervals, starting after the last driver reached his grid box. There would then be a pre-determined pause, and then the five lights would go off simultaneously. This was also the first race to have a single qualifying session on Saturday afternoon; the Friday session was dropped.

=== Qualifying ===

Jacques Villeneuve, making his début in Formula One, took pole position.

Both Forti cars failed make the race due to the new 107% rule for qualifying, which stated that any car that qualified 107% slower than the pole time (1:38.837 in this race) would be excluded. The measure was introduced as excessively slow entrants presented potential safety hazards due to a high speed difference. Incidentally, the team had logged its best result of 7th one race earlier at the season-ending 1995 Australian Grand Prix.

=== Race ===

It was an all-Williams front row with Damon Hill and debutant Jacques Villeneuve in the blue and white Rothmans cars. In the first corner. Hill was squeezed by Irvine, lost momentum and was overtaken by both Ferraris in the run down going into the third corner. Behind Hill, Alesi sliced across in front of Hakkinen and Barrichello to claim the corner and began a chain reaction of heavy braking as drivers tried to avoid colliding with one another. David Coulthard veered left under braking and his McLaren hit the side of Herbert&#x27;s Sauber. Herbert tried to avoid the car and braked heavily. Martin Brundle was behind them and unable to slow sufficiently, hitting the rear of Herbert&#x27;s and Coulthard&#x27;s cars and was launched into a barrel roll, ending in a sand trap at turn 3 and breaking his car in two. Brundle was unhurt. The race was halted to allow the circuit to be cleared.

The race was restarted. Brundle (in the spare car) spun off after light contact with Pedro Diniz. The Williams dominated again, with Jacques Villeneuve leading Hill. Schumacher held on in third place, but dropped back half a minute with his second pit stop. He developed brake problems on lap 28 and retired five laps later. Irvine assumed third, despite contact with Jean Alesi&#x27;s Benetton on lap 6, when Alesi had attempted to pass him. Towards the end of the race Villeneuve was slowed by an oil leak, which allowed Hill to catch and pass him. Hill took his 14th Grand Prix victory, equaling his father Graham&#x27;s overall number of wins. Hill took back to back Australian victories, the previous race being the last round of , in Adelaide. In the end, the podium was Hill–Villeneuve–Irvine.

==Classification==

===Qualifying===

===Race===
;Notes
* – Herbert is listed as &#x27;Did Not Start&#x27; (DNS) in the official results, despite having taken the first start prior to the race being stopped. Regulations at the time were such that in the event of a stoppage being ordered on the first lap, that start would be deemed null and void, and the second start would take place as if the first had never occurred. As he did not make the second start, he’s classified as DNS.

<text>The 1996 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Interlagos, São Paulo on 31 March 1996. It was the second race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.

The 71-lap race took place in heavy rain, and was won from pole position by Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, with Jean Alesi second in a Benetton-Renault and Michael Schumacher third in a Ferrari.

==Race summary==

Two local drivers, Tarso Marques (in his début race) and Pedro Diniz, had their qualifying times disallowed for, respectively, a push-start and missing a weight check. However, they were allowed to start from the back of the grid.

Johnny Herbert started from the pit lane after switching to the backup-car due to electrical problems.

Damon Hill, who loved driving in the rain, took the lead and won the race under these difficult conditions with a comfortable winning margin of 17 seconds. São Paulo saw the 15th GP victory of Damon Hill, who thereby outperformed a record established by his father Graham Hill, who had won 14 races.

Major battles in the race were going on between Barrichello and Alesi, Alesi and Villeneuve, Schumacher and Frentzen and Schumacher and Barrichello.

Barrichello, who had qualified as second, lost ground to Villeneuve and Alesi on the first lap, but he kept sticking to the back of the Benetton and attempted to overtake Alesi three times in the early stages of the race, outbraking him into the first corner only to slide wide on the exit allowing Alesi back through.

After a while, Alesi picked up pace and began to harry Villeneuve for 2nd place. After a battle Villeneuve eventually succumbed to the pressure and spun off. Approaching half-distance, Alesi had a brief off track excursion which finally allowed Barrichello through into 2nd place. However, Barrichello was forced to make what was supposed to be his only fuel stop on lap 35, when the track was still too wet for slick tyres. Alesi, on the other hand, did not have to pit until lap 42, by which time the track was dry enough to switch to slick tyres. This forced Barrichello to make unscheduled pit stop to make the switch to slicks, dropping him back behind Alesi.

To compound his misfortune, Barrichello made the switch too late, three laps later than Schumacher, meaning that he also dropped behind the German when he finally made his stop. With a clearly faster car, Barrichello began to harry Schumacher for the final podium spot. However, the German would not give in and eventually he braked too late and spun off into the gravel at the end of the back straight.

Gerhard Berger had to park his Benetton in the pits after 27 laps. The Austrian had difficulties during qualifying which he could not explain. When the race then started under wet conditions, Berger had to drive carefully because he had never before piloted the Benetton in the rain. Not too unsatisfied with his performance, Berger experienced cut-offs due to hydraulic problems which became worse and worse and finally forced the car back to the garage.

<text>The 1996 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 7 April 1996 at Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Buenos Aires. Despite suffering a bout of food poisoning, Damon Hill made it three wins out of three, with Jacques Villeneuve helping Williams complete their second one-two of the season. Jos Verstappen scored his only point of the season, Andrea Montermini his only finish of the season. This was the first race of 1996 where no drivers failed to meet the 107% time.

Pedro Diniz was involved in two major incidents during the race. First he collided with Luca Badoer, whose Forti was flipped and landed upside down in the gravel, forcing the marshals to bring out the safety car. Trackside marshals were heavily criticized for their delay in aiding Badoer&#x27;s escape from the car; ultimately the Italian was forced to crawl out from underneath the Forti (the explanation for which was later given by the marshals that an uncharacteristic delay in the safety car picking up the race leader had caused confusion on the trackside). Diniz managed to continue and made a pit stop as the safety car was preparing to pull in - only to retire when he came back onto the circuit and his Ligier burst into flames, because a safety-valve in the fuel tank had jammed open, with the safety car staying out for three extra laps as a result.

<text>The 1996 European Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Nürburgring in Germany on 28 April 1996. It was the fourth race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.

The 67-lap race was won by Jacques Villeneuve, driving a Williams-Renault. Villeneuve beat teammate and pole-sitter Damon Hill off the line and led all 67 laps, taking his first F1 victory in only his fourth race. Local driver Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari, with David Coulthard third in a McLaren-Mercedes, just ahead of Hill.

Both Benetton cars made extremely slow starts, due to the brakes locking on. Berger was forced to pit for fresh tyres after a flat-spot was caused, while Alesi finished lap 1 in 13th place and spun while trying to recover.

The Tyrrells were disqualified for separate infringements - Salo finished 10th but his car was found post-race to be underweight, while Katayama finished 12th but was disqualified for receiving an illegal push-start on the parade lap.

<text>The 1996 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the LIV Grand Prix Automobile de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 19 May 1996. It was the sixth race of the 1996 Formula One season. The race was run in very wet weather, and set a record for the fewest cars to be running at the end of a Grand Prix race, with the three podium finishers being the only cars left. 

Olivier Panis scored his first and only win of his Formula One career, earning the last Formula One victory for the Ligier team, and the first ever for engine manufacturer Mugen-Honda, after switching to slick tyres in a well-timed pitstop. Second place went to David Coulthard in a McLaren-Mercedes. Johnny Herbert was the last finisher in a Sauber, scoring his only points of the season. 

This was the last win by a French Formula One driver until Pierre Gasly won the 2020 Italian Grand Prix and also the last Grand Prix win by a French-licensed Formula One constructor until Renault won the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix.

==Report==

===Practice and qualifying===
Michael Schumacher had taken pole position but had caused controversy on his slowing down lap when he impeded Gerhard Berger right at the end of the session. Coming out of the tunnel Schumacher was cruising slowly, acknowledging the crowd, while Berger was on a fast lap. Schumacher tried to get out of Berger&#x27;s way but the Austrian had to spin at high speed to avoid the Ferrari, entering the chicane backwards.

The Ligiers were 14th and 17th in qualifying, both below their expectations after the team had mis-firing issues, preventing a top six position.

===Race day===
Olivier Panis was fastest in the warm-up. Jacques Villeneuve was 18th after running a wet-setup in preparation for the expected rain. Between the warm-up session and the race, heavy rain fell at the circuit, and an additional 15-minute session was added to allow the drivers to get used to the changed conditions as it was the first time rain had fallen over the race weekend. The session took place at 13:15 CEST (GMT +2). Several drivers went off during the session, including Pedro Lamy, Pedro Diniz and Giancarlo Fisichella, but all continued. The only two drivers to escape with damage were Mika Häkkinen and Andrea Montermini. Jean Alesi suffered a puncture at the end of the session, but was able to return to the pitlane. Several drivers opted to skip the session. The Footwork team chose not to participate as they did not have any spare parts, and any crash would have marked the end of their weekend. Häkkinen was fastest, setting his time before his crash, with Alesi, Rubens Barrichello and Johnny Herbert behind. The two Williams cars were 7th and 8th, Villeneuve ahead of Damon Hill with Schumacher behind them in 9th.

The race started at 14:30 CEST. During the warm-up session, Montermini crashed his Forti coming out of the tunnel, and the team&#x27;s lack of a spare car meant the Italian was unable to start, leaving 21 cars on the grid. Hill overtook Schumacher into Sainte-Dévote, while further back, Jos Verstappen, who had opted to start the race on slicks, slid straight into the wall. The two Minardis were then eliminated when they tangled coming out of the first corner. Hill began to pull away while polesitter Schumacher lost control coming out of Lower Mirabeau and hit the wall. Coming into the Rascasse, Barrichello spun and retired. After five laps, there were only 13 cars remaining as Ukyo Katayama (accident), Ricardo Rosset (accident) and Diniz (transmission) retired. A significant gap began to open between the leaders and Eddie Irvine in fourth. A queue of eight cars formed behind the slow Ferrari. Berger retired from third place on the 10th lap with gearbox trouble leaving 12 cars, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen damaged his front wing trying to pass Irvine, dropping to second last, ahead of Luca Badoer.

On lap 31, Martin Brundle spun off, which left only 11 cars in the race. Three laps later, Irvine was passed when Panis forced his way through at the Loews hairpin. Irvine lost control, became stuck and had undone his seatbelts before he restarted his car with the assistance of the marshals. Hill, meanwhile, had briefly lost the lead to Alesi when he made a pit stop on lap 30 to change to slicks as the track began to dry, but regained it a lap later when he overtook the Frenchman (who was still on wet tyres) on the track. Alesi made his pit stop shortly afterwards, allowing Hill to extend his lead to nearly 30 seconds and continue untroubled at the front until the 40th lap, when a failed oil pump caused his engine to blow coming out of the tunnel, his first retirement of the season. Alesi then led for 20 laps before his suspension failed, handing the lead to Panis. Luca Badoer was running six laps down in the Forti when he collided with Villeneuve at Mirabeau on lap 66, retiring both drivers.

The race did not run its full distance as the two-hour time limit came into effect. Panis was leading David Coulthard by a small margin with only five other cars behind them. Irvine spun at the same point that his teammate Schumacher had crashed, and as he tried to rejoin, he was hit by Mika Salo, who was in turn hit by Häkkinen. All three of them retired, leaving only four cars circulating, with Frentzen running last. The German decided to pull into the pits on the final lap as he was already last anyway, far behind everyone else who had taken the chequered flag. Panis thus won his one and only Grand Prix, taking Ligier&#x27;s first win in 15 years. Frentzen, Salo and Häkkinen were classified in the final points positions while Irvine was credited with seventh place.

<text>The 1996 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Catalunya on 2 June 1996. It was the seventh race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.

This race, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s first Ferrari victory, is generally regarded as one of his finest. In the torrential rain, he produced a stunning drive, and is a prime example of why he earned the nickname &quot;Regenmeister&quot; (&quot;Rainmaster&quot;), despite his early and unforced crash at a wet Monaco Grand Prix two weeks earlier. The race was also Schumacher&#x27;s 20th career win.

At the start, Schumacher lost several positions due to a clutch problem, which indirectly resulted in several clashes in the main straight involving 5 cars. Giancarlo Fisichella emerged from the carnage with a blown left front and a missing rear wing, while Olivier Panis escaped with suspension damage. Both pulled into the pits and retired a lap later.

Mika Salo was disqualified for the second time this season, for changing cars after the field was under starter&#x27;s orders.

Damon Hill had started the race from pole position, but dropped to 8th after spinning twice in the opening laps, before another spin into the pit wall on lap 12 ended his race. Schumacher recovered from a poor start to take the lead from Villeneuve on lap 13, and from then on he dominated the race, lapping over three seconds a lap faster than the remainder of the field.

Rubens Barrichello was running a competitive race, getting as high as 2nd place after Jacques Villeneuve and Alesi made their pit stops. After his own scheduled (lengthy) pitstop he was sent back to the race but forced to retire from third place with 20 laps to go after a clutch problem caused his engine to fade out. On the previous lap, Gerhard Berger had spun his Benetton out of fourth place while trying to lap the Ligier of Pedro Diniz. Alesi and Villeneuve switched places on their own pitstops, Alesi taking his only one some 6 laps before Villeneuve.

After an uneventful race on his part, Heinz-Harald Frentzen finished in fourth, while Mika Häkkinen took fifth after surviving a spin off the track in the closing stages of the race. Jos Verstappen, running fifth after the retirements of Barrichello and Berger, crashed into the tyre barrier with 12 laps left, guaranteeing Diniz his first Formula One point as by this time only six drivers were left in the race. With no further retirements, Diniz brought his car home in sixth, after driving at a more cautious pace that saw him fall two laps adrift of the front runners by the end.

<text>Martin the Warrior is a fantasy novel by Brian Jacques, published in 1993. It is the sixth book in the &quot;Redwall&quot; series. It is also one of the three &quot;Redwall&quot; novels to be made into a television series, alongside the self-titled novel (Season 1) and &quot;Mattimeo&quot; (Season 2).

== Subdivisions ==
*The Prisoner and the Tyrant
*Actors and Searchers
*The Battle of Marshank

==Plot==

&quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; tells the story of a young mouse named Martin, a slave in Marshank under the cruel stoat Badrang the Tyrant. When Badrang leaves Martin to be tortured by the weather and the gulls, a young mousemaid named Laterose, or Rose (with whom Martin falls in love), and a European mole named Grumm hear his cry of defiance. They become instrumental in helping Martin, along with a young male Eurasian red squirrel named Felldoh, and Rose&#x27;s brother Brome, escape Marshank. When that is accomplished, they decide to travel to Noonvale to rouse an army to attack Marshank. However, in the ocean, Felldoh and Brome are separated from Rose, Martin, and Grumm. Felldoh and Brome meet up with the Rambling Rosehip Players, a travelling band of creatures, and join forces with them, eventually freeing the slaves as Brome bluffs his way into and out of Marshank, disguised as a rat from Captain Tramun Clogg the stoat&#x27;s corsair crew. Meanwhile, Martin, Rose and Grumm meet a female common hedgehog named Pallum after being imprisoned by Eurasian pygmy shrews. They are eventually freed by saving the life of the Pygmy Queen&#x27;s son, Dinjer, along with Pallum, who in turn joins up with them.

After a long series of adventures, the four adventurers reach Noonvale, Rose and Grumm&#x27;s home. They gather an army there, but it is not large enough. But all is not lost. Boldred, a scholarly female short-eared owl whom they met on the way to Noonvale, helps gather a huge army, including the pygmy shrews and the Gawtrybe (a group of savage red squirrels). The entire army then sails to Marshank and reach it in good timing, since the Rambling Rosehip Players are in a predicament. Badrang and all of the vermin under his command, with the exception of mad Cap&#x27;n Tramun Clogg, are slain.

Rose is killed in the final battle by the very tyrant she had gone with Martin to defeat. After the battle, Martin, along with Ballaw the male hare, Rowanoak the female Eurasian badger, Brome, and Keyla the male European otter all stay in Polleekin the female mole&#x27;s treehouse for the short rest of the season. Martin is devastated, his one love gone, and has nowhere to go. He declines going back to Noonvale with the rest, the memory of Laterose lingering too strong, not to mention he&#x27;ll have to tell Urran Voh what had happened to his daughter. He makes a vow not to tell anyone about his friends or Noonvale, to protect them from enemies. He decides simply to relate a tale of living by the sword in the caves until the time came to move on southward.

The story of Martin and Rose is later brought to Redwall during the time of Abbot Saxtus the Eurasian harvest mouse by Aubretia the mouse, a descendant of Brome, and Bultip the hedgehog, a descendant of Pallum, who brought a sprig of climbing-rose culled from that which grew on Rose of Noonvale&#x27;s grave. This becomes the Laterose of Redwall. In the passing of Spring to Summer, it blooms year round a bit later than the rest, and that is why it is called the Laterose.

<text>Shock is a 1946 American film noir directed by Alfred L. Werker and starring Vincent Price, Lynn Bari and Frank Latimore. It was produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox.

==Plot==

A young woman named Janet Stewart is anticipating the arrival of her husband and attempts to check into a hotel. They are meeting after years apart and have planned to meet at the hotel. During his military service he was presumed dead, but actually was a prisoner of war. Unfortunately, her cable requesting the reservation never arrived. The staff, after hearing her story, agree to provide a room for the night. Restless, she hears a loud argument and goes to the balcony window where she witnesses a man striking his wife with a candlestick. The woman is killed.

The next morning, her husband arrives and attempts to surprise Janet. Instead, he discovers her sitting on the couch, staring into space. She has gone into a state of shock as a result of seeing the murder. The hotel doctor is called, but he suggests she see a specialist.

The specialist that she sees turns out to be Dr. Cross, the man who murdered his wife.

==Cast==
* Vincent Price as Dr. Richard Cross
* Lynn Bari as Elaine Jordan
* Frank Latimore as Lt. Paul Stewart
* Anabel Shaw as Janet Stewart
* Stephen Dunne as Dr. Stevens (as Michael Dunne)
* Reed Hadley as O&#x27;Neill
* Renee Carson as Mrs. Hatfield
* Ruth Nelson as Mrs. Margaret Cross (uncredited)
* Charles Trowbridge as Dr. Franklin Harvey
* Ruth Clifford as Mrs. Margaret Cross

==Production==
The film was originally to be directed by Henry Hathaway.

==Reception==
Above and beyond the typical characteristics of the horror film genre, reviewer Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; took particular offense to the film&#x27;s treatment of psychiatry. Coming in the wake of World War II, in which so many people had suffered shock and could benefit from treatment of their anxieties, Crowther asked the &quot;critical observer to protest in no uncertain tones&quot; the movie&#x27;s &quot;social disservice&quot; in its fostering &quot;apprehension against the treatment of nervous disorders&quot;, deploring the lack of consideration for those in need of treatment evidenced by producer Aubrey Schenck and distributor Twentieth Century-Fox. Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; took no such offense, calling the film a &quot;nominal &#x27;B&#x27; feature&quot;, which screenplay author &quot;Eugene Ling and Director Alfred Werker have imbued... with a grade-A suspense&quot;. Jonathan Malcolm Lampley wrote in &quot;Women in the Horror Films of Vincent Price&quot; that his role in this film &quot;foreshadows the mad doctors and scientists Price would frequently portray in his later career&quot;.

<doc id="1123276" wikidata="Q65714" url="?curid=1123276" title="1996 Canadian Grand Prix">
<text>The 1996 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal on 16 June 1996. It was the eighth race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.

The 69-lap race was won from pole position by Briton Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. Local driver Jacques Villeneuve, Hill&#x27;s teammate and the son of Gilles, finished second, with Frenchman Jean Alesi third in a Benetton-Renault.

==Report==

Michael Schumacher started from the back of the grid, as his car suffered a fuel pressure problem as the field set off on the warm-up lap. This started a run of mechanical problems for the reigning double World Champion.

Eddie Irvine became the first retirement from 4th position in the leading Ferrari on lap 2 when his suspension failed, he was then followed out by Ukyo Katayama in the second Tyrrell and Ricardo Rosset in the second Footwork when they collided at the final chicane on lap 7 due to Katayama missing his braking point. Before Rosset&#x27;s teammate Jos Verstappen in the leading Footwork retired in the pits on lap 11 when his engine failed. Rubens Barrichello in the second Jordan after passing Mika Hakkinen for 6th position would also be forced the retire on lap 23 in the pits after his first pit stop when his clutch failed. Michael Schumacher after starting at the back of the grid due to a clutch problem, was able to fight his way up to 13th position, but would soon retire due to driveshaft failure on lap 42 which started the first of three consecutive races which both Ferrari&#x27;s would fail to finish a race due to mechanical failures.
For the second successive race, Gerhard Berger spun off and hit the wall while trying to pass teammate Jean Alesi on lap 43 at turn 4. Alesi continued to third place, while further behind Martin Brundle, running fourth following Berger&#x27;s exit, had to pit for a new nose-cone following a collision with Pedro Lamy&#x27;s Minardi when Lamy inadvertently hit Brundle&#x27;s front wing as he attempted to rejoin the track after a spin on lap 45, dropping Brundle to seventh and handing fourth place to David Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren. Brundle eventually recovered to sixth place behind Mika Häkkinen in the sister McLaren after getting past Johnny Herbert courtesy of a faster final pit stop.

The 72-lap race was won by Briton Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from second position. German Michael Schumacher took pole position in his Ferrari but failed to start the race after his engine blew on the warm-up lap, leaving Hill to lead from start to finish except for the pit stops. Hill&#x27;s teammate, Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, who had crashed heavily at Estoril corner in qualifying, finished second, with local driver Jean Alesi third in a Benetton-Renault.

This was the last Grand Prix where a Forti car started the race as they would fail to qualify for the remaining Grand Prix they would enter, however both cars were forced to retire.

<text>Arto Saari (born November 9, 1981) is a Finnish retired professional skateboarder and photographer.

==Early life==
Saari was born in Seinäjoki, Finland. His mother was supportive of his skateboarding and his first skateboard was a Vision Gator model.

==Skateboarding==
Saari first attracted attention from the global skateboarding community when he won silver at the skateboarding world championships in Munster, Germany in 1998 at the age of 16 years. Following the event, Saari was invited by professional skateboarder Danny Way to tour Canada with Plan B, Platinum, and the Red Dragons teams, and received a mailed airline ticket at his family home. Saari&#x27;s professional skateboarding career commenced following his decision to relocate to the United States after joining Flip Skateboards.

Saari was selected as the &quot;2001 Skater of the Year&quot; by &quot;Thrasher&quot;. To this day Saari remains one of only two Europeans to ever win the industry&#x27;s premier award. After receiving the award, Saari stated, &quot;I never thought it would actually like ... whatever, happen to me, or what not. Like, it&#x27;s just one of those things that&#x27;s just come out of the blue, you know?&quot;

In what was perceived as a shocking decision by the global skateboard community, Saari announced his decision to leave Flip in 2008 due to the distress that was caused by the death of Flip rider Shane Cross. Saari joined the team at Alien Workshop. In an interview with skateboard journalist, Chris Nieratko, following his decision (Saari later contacted Nieratko to prevent the interview from being published and the journalist published it on his personal website instead), Saari explained the process of leaving Flip:
It was really heavy but they [Flip] took it pretty good. I thought they were going to come and chop my legs off but they were very reasonable about it but it’s been a heavy process. It’s been on good terms. I just felt like I had to move on. I changed all my other sponsors, I might as well. Why stop now? New knee, new liver, new shoe company, new board sponsor ... Yeah, I did shed a few tears. It’s like getting a divorce; even though I’ve never been married other than Flip. I can imagine it’s something like that. There’s parts that you like but there’s parts that you just want to move on past. It’s really hard to deal with. You wonder, ‘Are you going to lose friends? Are you going to lose business?’ It was a tough decision to make and I’m still spun out about it. I can’t believe that it’s all happening but I think it will be for the better for everyone ... I just couldn’t take it any longer. I couldn’t take the madness and I thought it would be better to move on than to stay somewhere where I don’t think I necessarily belong anymore. Things have changed a lot over the years and I thought it would be better to explore something new, to be like a little kid in a candy store.

In the Nieratko interview, Saari also discussed Rowley&#x27;s response to his decision:
“Don’t do it.” He knew it had to happen. We’re still cool. He understands. He’s like, “Go do your thing. Go skate around.” It was a very, very emotional, gnarly thing. It’s been so many years in the same boat you have to start going in different ways. Sometimes the ship gets too small, too many egos, you got to jump overboard and catch the next one and see where that takes you.

In 2012, Saari provided further insight into his decision to leave Flip, citing the death of former teammate, Shane Cross, as a significant underpinning factor: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t, like, a easy thing to do, but, at the time, I knew I had to do it ... for the reasons that happened, you know? And that&#x27;s why I decided that it&#x27;s better off for me to leave Flip than, just, go my own way and, just, do that.&quot; Professional skateboarder, Ed Templeton, stated in a 2012 interview: &quot;I mean I was completely shocked when he left Flip ... it didn&#x27;t make sense.&quot;

At the start of January 2011, Flip announced that Saari had rejoined the team and released an image that featured Saari alongside the caption: &quot;Home is Where the Hearto Is&quot;. A video segment was also published on the website of &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine and featured Rowley, Saari and &quot;Thrasher&quot; editor-in-chief, Jake Phelps, discussing the decision in Phelps&#x27; office in San Francisco, US. Saari explained to Phelps that Flip is like &quot;family&quot; and stated &quot;You can take a man out of Flip, but you can&#x27;t take the Flip out the man&quot;.

In 2012, Fox disclosed the process of re-recruiting Saari:
I went up and saw him with Geoff, one day, because it seemed like he really ... well, I could tell; we could all tell that he wanted to be back on the team. Arto&#x27;s not a very pushy person, at all. Never the guy who will ask for anything, and I just said to Geoff one day, &quot;Let&#x27;s just, we need to drive up there and then, and just put him back on the team. Make him put himself back on; because, otherwise, this is never going to happen.&quot; Maybe he&#x27;d grown up and realized that it might be a little dysfunctional family, but it is my family.

Also in 2012, Rowley confirmed that &quot;It came from Arto, you know, saying that, like, this is where he belonged, kinda thing ... We know each other long enough to know, when you&#x27;re hanging out with someone that, hey, like, okay, he&#x27;s ready now.&quot; Saari has also stated:
It was a pretty unspoken thing. It wasn&#x27;t until the last minute that, it was like, &quot;You wanna get back on?&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah&quot;. We [Rowley and Saari] probably didn&#x27;t talk for like a year or two. There was this vibe. That&#x27;s how I grew up skating; those are the guys who brought me up, backed me up. And I was, like, &quot;You know what? I gotta, I gotta get back on.&quot;

Alongside professional skateboarders Stevie Williams, Brandon Biebel, and Tony Alva, Saari completed a photo and video shoot for Playboy that was shot by Irish photographer Tony Kelly. The shoot is entitled &quot;Playboy Poolside&quot; and features the four subjects skateboarding in and around an empty swimming pool.

In a February 2014 radio interview with &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine, Saari identified his video part in Flip&#x27;s &quot;Sorry&quot; as the video appearance that he is most proud of.

Saari has had several major injuries during his career. Saari was nineteen years of age when he almost died of brain injuries, suffered as he was warming up for the execution of a trick on a handrail. The incident was represented in the form of a cartoon in Flip&#x27;s first video, &quot;Sorry&quot;.

Saari appears as a playable character in the video games &quot;Evolution Skateboarding&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground&quot;.

===Sponsors===
As of July 2014, Saari is sponsored by Flip Skateboards, New Balance Numeric, WeSC, Ricta, CCS, MOB, Destructo Trucks and hOme Watches.

In late 2012, the Burton company announced a major restructure in accordance with a plan to focus more closely on its core business; consequently, the skateboard teams of the Gravis and Analog brands were dissolved. Saari&#x27;s move to WeSC was announced on April 26, 2013, following Saari&#x27;s selection as the first skateboarder of the international team of hOme Watches—alongside snowboarders Travis Rice, Gigi Rüf and Mark Sollors—in the previous month. Then, in May 2013, Saari was announced as a member of the New Balance Numeric skate footwear team.

==Photography==
According to their website, he is one of skateboarders that &quot;have gravitated towards Leica M equipment&quot;.

In a May 2011 interview for the CCS web-based channel, Saari identified an old press camera and a Noblex medium-format panoramic camera as two of his favorite possessions—Saari also identifies a framed black and white photograph, taken with the latter camera, of the Helsinki Cathedral as one of his favorite images.

In early 2013, Saari was selected as the photographer for the &quot;Fear and Loathing in Australia&quot; Oakley skateboard tour that featured the sunglasses brand&#x27;s team riders: Eric Koston, Rune Glifberg, Ryan Sheckler, and Curren Caples. The Oakley site explained that Saari was employed for advertisement campaigns and gallery shows, while his demand as a photographer is equivalent to his popularity at the height of his skateboarding career.

In 2024, Saari published &quot;Bike Path&quot;, a photo book documenting the bicycle path which winds along the Seven Mile Miracle on the North Shore.

==Personal life==
In 2017 Saari married his girlfriend Mimi.
They have a daughter and a son.
As of 2018, Saari and his family reside in Hawaii, on the North Shore of Oahu.

Saari has previously lived in Hollywood, just off Sunset Strip. His home had a pool specifically designed for skateboarding and a separate sauna building. Saari referred to his sauna as &quot;another little piece of Finland&quot; in which you go &quot;onto the top of the pleasure field&quot;.

<text>The 1996 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 14 July 1996. It was the tenth race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.

Williams&#x27; Jacques Villeneuve took his second win of the season from Benetton&#x27;s Gerhard Berger, with McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen coming home third for his first podium since his near-fatal crash at 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Jordan&#x27;s Rubens Barrichello took fourth, equalling his best finish of the season, and it came after he had been involved in late collisions while racing for fourth place at the circuit in the previous two years. The final points went to David Coulthard in the second McLaren and Martin Brundle in the second Jordan.

Damon Hill took pole position for his home race, but made a slow start and retired shortly before half distance, after a wheel nut problem caused him to spin off at Copse Corner while he was trying to pass Häkkinen. For the third consecutive race, Ferrari drivers Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine were both forced to retire with technical issues in the first six laps – Schumacher with hydraulic problems and Irvine with a differential failure. Jean Alesi would become another notable retirement on lap 45 from 3rd place, just ahead of teammate Gerhard Berger when his rear brakes overheated.

The 45-lap race was won by British driver Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from pole position. Austrian driver Gerhard Berger started alongside Hill on the front row in his Benetton-Renault and led for much of the race, until his engine failed with three laps remaining. Hill duly took his seventh victory of the season, with Berger&#x27;s French teammate Jean Alesi second and Canadian Jacques Villeneuve third in the other Williams-Renault.

With the win, Hill extended his lead over Villeneuve in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 21 points with five races remaining.

<text>The 1996 Belgian Grand Prix (formally the LIV Grand Prix de Belgique) was a Formula One motor race held on 25 August 1996 at Spa-Francorchamps. It was the thirteenth race of the 1996 FIA Formula One World Championship.

The 44-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari. Schumacher had crashed heavily in Friday practice, but recovered to qualify third before taking his second win of the season. Jacques Villeneuve, who had started from pole position, finished second in his Williams-Renault, with Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Mercedes. Villeneuve&#x27;s teammate and Drivers&#x27; Championship leader, Damon Hill, finished fifth.

== Qualifying ==

== Race ==
The start of the race saw the two Saubers of Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Johnny Herbert eliminated immediately when they collided at the La Source hairpin, following an incident that also involved Olivier Panis&#x27; Ligier and Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s Jordan. Panis also retired on the spot; Barrichello was able to continue, pitting to repair his suspension, although it eventually failed altogether on lap 30. On lap 10, Jos Verstappen pitted with a sticking throttle. The Footwork Arrows pit crew found no damage and sent Verstappen back out, only for the Dutchman to crash almost immediately. Team boss Tom Walkinshaw confirmed after the race that the throttle problem had not recurred, and that the crash was caused by a faulty wheel.

The incident brought out the safety car for seven laps, during which time all the drivers besides the McLarens of Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard (both running a one-stop strategy) made pit stops. Jacques Villeneuve, leading the race when the safety car came out, missed his pit stop on lap 13. As a result, he lost the lead to Michael Schumacher, who eventually won the race by 5.6 seconds from Villeneuve. The Canadian driver later explained that he had misunderstood the radio instruction to come in, due to the confusion brought about by the deployment of the safety car. As a further consequence of Villeneuve&#x27;s error, teammate Damon Hill was instructed to pit by the Williams engineers, only to then be told to stay out just as he was heading into the pit lane. Hill was driving the spare Williams following a misfire in the Sunday morning warm-up session. By the time he finally got to make his pit stop, he had fallen to 13th, but he recovered to finish fifth.

Running in fourth place at half distance, Gerhard Berger spun off in his Benetton while trying to pass Eddie Irvine&#x27;s Ferrari, an error which dropped him to 12th. After setting a string of fastest laps he recovered to sixth by the end of the race, thanks in part to Irvine&#x27;s retirement with gearbox problems. Berger&#x27;s Benetton teammate Jean Alesi finished fourth after Coulthard had spun off into retirement and crashed on lap 38.

The Tyrrells of Mika Salo and Ukyo Katayama finished in seventh and eighth places respectively; however, a fast early stop during the safety car period saw Salo running as high as third at one point.

<text>The 1996 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 8 September 1996 at Monza. It was the fourteenth race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.

The 53-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, after he started from third position. It was Schumacher&#x27;s third victory of the season and the Ferrari team&#x27;s first victory at Monza since 1988. Jean Alesi finished second in a Benetton-Renault, with Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Mercedes. Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Damon Hill took pole position in his Williams-Renault and led until he made an error and spun off on lap 6, while his teammate and rival, Jacques Villeneuve, could only manage seventh.

==Pre-race==

To stop cars kerb-hopping at chicanes due to ongoing track modifications at the time of the race, tyre barriers were erected at each chicane. However this caused much controversy during the race, particularly in the opening laps, when two tyres ran free across the track in the path of other drivers. Damon Hill had a comfortable lead but would retire after colliding with the tyres.

==Race==

Jean Alesi made an excellent start from sixth to lead polesitter Damon Hill into the first corner, but ran wide and struck a tyre stack between the two Lesmos on the opening lap and lost the lead to Hill. Alesi was fortunate to escape with his own car undamaged, but his error caused a tyre to fall on the track and break the front wing of Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s McLaren. Häkkinen was forced to pit for a new nose-cone, dropping him to seventeenth on the track.

Jacques Villeneuve sent a tyre spinning into David Coulthard&#x27;s car at the Ascari chicane on the opening lap in a similar incident while trying to pass Michael Schumacher. Villeneuve was able to continue, although the collision with the tyre stack bent his suspension, which slowed his car and forced him to pit for a new set of tyres, a new nose-cone and a new steering wheel, dropping him to sixteenth place and putting him a lap behind. Coulthard was less fortunate, and immediately spun off with a broken suspension pushrod. Villeneuve apologised to Coulthard after the race. Whilst Gerhard Berger in the second Benetton had eventually pulled off before Parabolica when his gearbox failed on lap 5.

Hill was leading by four seconds on lap six when he hit the tyre barriers at the first chicane and retired with broken suspension. Eddie Irvine ran in third place for most of the first half of the race before having a similar accident. In all, eight cars made contact with the tyre barriers after running wide on the track, of which five (Hill, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Olivier Panis, Ricardo Rosset and Irvine) retired.

Michael Schumacher also hit a tyre stack in the closing stages but continued without damage to his car and won the race. This was his first ever Italian Grand Prix victory after years of misfortunes including the collision with Hill the previous year, as well as his team&#x27;s first win at Monza since 1988. Alesi, who re-took the lead following Hill&#x27;s exit, finished second after losing out to Schumacher in the pit stops, and Häkkinen eventually recovered to third place thanks in part to Irvine&#x27;s retirement. The Jordan-Peugeots of Martin Brundle and Rubens Barrichello finished in fourth and fifth positions respectively after a race-long battle for fourth place, Brundle overtaking at the Parabolica corner after Barrichello accidentally turned his engine off while trying to investigate a clutch problem, and had to get a push-start from the marshalls to continue. Pedro Diniz finished sixth ahead of Villeneuve, who only managed seventh place after Johnny Herbert&#x27;s engine cut out on the final lap.

<text>The 1996 Portuguese Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 22 September 1996 at Autódromo do Estoril in Estoril, Portugal. It was the 15th and penultimate race of the 1996 Formula One season.

Williams&#x27; Jacques Villeneuve won the race from team-mate Damon Hill and Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher, having overtaken the latter on the outside of the final corner while the two were lapping the slow-moving back-marking Minardi of Giovanni Lavaggi (who at the time was described by BBC TV commentator Jonathan Palmer as &quot;desperately slow&quot; and &quot;there because of his money&quot;). This victory, Villeneuve&#x27;s fourth of the season, ensured that the Drivers&#x27; Championship battle between him and Hill went to the final round in Japan three weeks later.

Benetton&#x27;s Jean Alesi finished fourth, just behind Schumacher, while Eddie Irvine in the second Ferrari and Gerhard Berger in the second Benetton survived a last-lap collision to take fifth and sixth respectively.

The Portuguese Grand Prix would not be held again until 2020 but this race was held at a new venue at the Algarve International Circuit as opposed to Estoril.

<text>The 1996 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the XXII Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Suzuka on 13 October 1996. It was the sixteenth and final race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.

The 52-lap race was won by Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault. Hill took his eighth win of the season, and with it the Drivers&#x27; Championship, after teammate and pole-sitter Jacques Villeneuve made a poor start and then retired when a wheel fell off. Villeneuve had needed to win the race, without Hill scoring, in order to win the Championship himself. Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari, enabling the Italian team to steal second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship from Benetton, with Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Mercedes.

Hill was the first son of a World Champion to win the championship himself, his father Graham having been champion in and . This was also the final race for Martin Brundle, who had been competing in F1 since and finished on the podium 9 times since , as well as the last race for Pedro Lamy, Giovanni Lavaggi, Footwork and Ligier.

==Report==

=== Background and qualifying ===
This was the first time since 1977 that Japan hosted the final round of the World Championship. This was the final race broadcast on television in the United Kingdom by the British Broadcasting Corporation until the 2009 F1 season. Starting from 1997 until 2008, ITV would broadcast on British television. As a result, this would be Jonathan Palmer’s final race as commentator. This was also Steve Rider’s final race as anchor until 2006. In qualifying, Villeneuve beat Hill to pole position by nearly half a second, with a further 0.7 seconds back to Schumacher in third.

=== Race ===
On race day, the first start was aborted when David Coulthard stalled his McLaren. At the second start, Villeneuve made a poor getaway and fell to sixth behind Hill, Gerhard Berger, Häkkinen, Schumacher and Eddie Irvine. Meanwhile, Jean Alesi, attempting to make up several places after qualifying ninth, spun off at the second corner and destroyed his Benetton; Alesi was unhurt from the impact. On the third lap, Berger attempted to overtake Hill at the final chicane, only to damage his front wing; after having to pit for a new nosecone, Berger dropped to eighteenth, and last, place, effectively ending his challenge for the lead.

Thereafter, Hill gradually pulled away, with Schumacher overtaking Häkkinen for second during the first round of pit stops. Pedro Diniz had lost control of his Ligier at the final chicane and spun off into the gravel trap by lap 14. Hill pitted for his second stop with a 25-second gap to Schumacher, emerging narrowly ahead of the Ferrari, before pulling away gradually once again to lead by 13 seconds with ten laps remaining. 

Villeneuve, meanwhile, passed Irvine, set the fastest lap of the race and ran fourth before his right rear wheel came off on lap 37 due to a wheel bearing failure (this was the same incident that happened to team-mate Damon Hill during the British Grand Prix, according to BBC pit reporter Tony Jardine), putting him out of the race and handing the Drivers&#x27; Championship to Hill, already dropped by Williams for the following season. Whilst fighting for fourth place, Gerhard Berger (having fought back to fifth place following his earlier collision with Hill) had another collision with the Ferrari of Eddie Irvine at the final chicane causing the Northern Irishman to spin out and retire, but Berger was able to carry on unscathed. A late fightback saw Schumacher close the gap to Hill, but Hill held on to win the race by 1.8 seconds, with Häkkinen a further 1.4 seconds back, while Berger recovered to finish fourth, Martin Brundle came fifth in his final Grand Prix, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen picked up the final point for sixth.

In the UK, this was the last F1 race until to be broadcast live by the BBC. As Hill crossed the line to win the race and the championship, commentator Murray Walker said, &quot;And I&#x27;ve got to stop, because I&#x27;ve got a lump in my throat.&quot;

<text>Enya is the debut studio album by Irish singer, songwriter, and musician Enya, released in March 1987 by BBC Records in the UK and by Atlantic Records in the US. It was renamed as The Celts for the 1992 international re-release of the album by WEA Records in Europe and by Reprise Records in the US. The album features a selection of music that she recorded for the soundtrack to &quot;The Celts&quot;, a BBC documentary series about the origins, growth, and influence of Celtic culture.

Four years into her largely unnoticed solo career, Enya landed her first major project in 1985 when producer Tony McAuley asked her to contribute a song for the project. It was well received by director David Richardson, who subsequently offered her to compose for the entire series. Enya worked with her longtime recording partners, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. Several track titles are titled or based on various historical and mythological figures and stories associated with the Celts, and established Enya&#x27;s sound of keyboard-oriented music and layered vocals. &quot;Boadicea&quot; has been sampled by various artists, most notably in 1996 by The Fugees, in 2004 by Mario Winans with P. Diddy and in 2022 by Metro Boomin.

&quot;Enya&quot; received mostly mixed reviews from critics when it was initially released. It was a commercial success in Ireland, peaking at No. 8, and No. 69 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;The Celts&quot; were released as singles; the latter went to No. 29 in the UK. The album caught the attention of Warner chairman Rob Dickins, who signed Enya to the label. After the commercial success of her next two albums, &quot;Enya&quot; was reissued as &quot;The Celts&quot; and outperformed its original sales; it went to No. 10 in the UK and was certified Platinum in the UK and the US. In 2009, &quot;The Celts&quot; was reissued in Japan with a bonus track.

== Background and recording ==
Following her work on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy film &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; (1985), Enya&#x27;s first major project as a solo artist followed when, in 1985, she was invited by producer Tony McAuley to compose a track for his 1987 BBC television documentary series &quot;The Celts&quot;. As a coincidence, Enya had recorded a track named &quot;March of the Celts&quot; before she was asked to be involved, and decided to submit it to the project. Initially, each episode of the series was to feature a different composer, but series director David Richardson liked Enya&#x27;s track so much, he commissioned her to compose the entire score.

Enya worked with her usual recording partners, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. The album was recorded in two locations; at Aigle Studio, a 16-track studio installed in the Ryans&#x27; home, then located in Artane, a northern suburb of Dublin, and a sound studio at BBC Enterprises at Wood Lane, London. When they recorded at the BBC studio, Nicky had to teach the audio engineers how he and Enya worked as their unusual recording process confused them at first. Nicky said he told them &quot;to forget everything [they had] learned and just bear with us for at least a week&quot;. One such example was Nicky&#x27;s use of reverb, which he set to 24 seconds instead of the more common placement of one-and-a-half seconds.

A total of 72 minutes of music was recorded for the series. Roma recalled that Enya was given &quot;various pastiches&quot; that Richardson wished to incorporate into the episodes, which Enya then used as a guide for to write music to complement them. &quot;Enya&quot; includes 39 minutes of selected pieces from the soundtrack. The album&#x27;s front cover depicts Enya posing with stuffed wolves.

== Music and lyrics ==
Several of the album&#x27;s track titles are titled or based on various historical figures and stories. In writing about the song in 2002, Roma pointed out that &quot;Aldebaran&quot; is named after the brightest star in the constellation of Taurus. In the Arabic language, the title translates to &quot;the follower&quot; as it follows the Pleiades cluster of stars, and the song is based on future Celtic people &quot;passing Aldebaran on their journey to new territories, continuing their migratory pattern which was so predominant in their early history.&quot; The track was recorded in its entirety at Aigle Studio as Nicky expressed the difficulty in having to recreate the recording process elsewhere. &quot;The Celts&quot; was used as the main title theme for the television series. &quot;Boadicea&quot;, which means &quot;victorious&quot;, is a reference to the queen Boudica of the British-Celtic Iceni tribe in East Anglia who led a resistance against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in 60 A.D., but was defeated and subsequently poisoned herself. As a song about her was already written, Richardson wished for a new track that depicted the idea of &quot;being spellbound&quot; by Boudica, which turned into &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot;. In the liner notes of the album&#x27;s 1992 reissue, &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot; is described, simply, as &quot;thoughts of the present&quot; and &quot;March of the Celts&quot; &quot;echoes from the past&quot;. &quot;Deireadh an Tuath&quot;, which translates from Irish as &quot;End of the Tribe&quot;, refers to past spirits and the fertile soil that helps ensure the future of the Celtic people, which is celebrated in the annual Gaelic festival Samhain, held on 31 October. &quot;The Sun in the Stream&quot; was inspired by the legend of the Salmon of Knowledge, a creature written about in various texts in Irish mythology who &quot;possessed all the truth in the world&quot;.

&quot;Fairytale&quot; is a track based on a story of early Irish literature about &quot;love, jealousy, secrets and endurance&quot; between Midir, a fairy king, and his love for a princess, Étaín. In the story, Étaín is banished and transformed into a pool of water and emerges from it as a butterfly. &quot;Epona&quot; is the name of the horse goddess Epona of the Gallo-Roman religion. &quot;Triad&quot; is a track formed of three sections; &quot;St. Patrick&quot; is a traditional song that refers to Saint Patrick who spent six years in captivity after he was captured by the Celtic people. &quot;St. Patrick&quot; lyrics were adapted from ancient hymn &quot;Deus Meus Adiuva Me&quot;. The second part, &quot;Cú Chulainn&quot;, Irish for &quot;hound of Culann&quot;, is named after the culture hero Cú Chulainn. &quot;Oisin&quot;, the final section, meaning &quot;little fawn&quot;, is based on the mythological character Oisín. &quot;Bard Dance&quot; refers to the bard, a man of ancient Celtic times who entertained the king. &quot;Dan y Dŵr&quot;, which translates to &quot;Under the Water&quot; in the Welsh language, is based on the intentional flooding of the village of Capel Celyn in Wales in order to accommodate a reservoir, Llyn Celyn.

== Release ==
&quot;Enya&quot; was released on audio cassette and vinyl in February 1987 by BBC Records the United Kingdom through EMI Records. The label was enthusiastic about the album and decided to release it three months before the series aired on television. The album was released in the United States by Atlantic Records, which categorised it as a new age album and placed an imprint saying so on the disc, which Nicky Ryan later thought was &quot;a cowardly thing to do&quot;. The album gained enough public interest to reach number eight on the Irish Albums Chart. In the United Kingdom, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 79 for the week of 6 June 1987, climbing to its peak of number 69 on its fourth and final week on the chart, the week of 27 June.

Enya released &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot; as a single on 9 March 1987 as a 7-inch and compact disc with &quot;The Celts&quot; as the B-side. A maxi single was also released with the aforementioned tracks and &quot;To Go Beyond (I)&quot; and &quot;To Go Beyond (II)&quot;. Following the album&#x27;s reissue in 1992, &quot;The Celts&quot; was released as a single on 2 November 1992 with &quot;Eclipse&quot;, a previously unreleased track from the &quot;Enya&quot; sessions, as a B-side. Another unreleased track, &quot;Spaghetti Western Theme from &quot;The Celts&quot;&quot;, was released in 2005 as a B-side for Enya&#x27;s 2005 single &quot;Amarantine&quot;. It was released in memory of McAuley following his death in 2003.

Filmmaker David Bickley reused music from the soundtrack in &quot;The Memory of Earth&quot;, an instalment in his documentary trilogy &quot;Mythological Lands&quot;. &quot;Boadicea&quot; was also used in the soundtrack of the 1992 American film &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;. &quot;Epona&quot; appears in the 1991 Steve Martin romantic comedy &quot;L.A. Story&quot;.

=== 1992 reissue ===
In 1992, after Enya gained worldwide commercial success with her albums &quot;Watermark&quot; (1988) and &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; (1991) for Warner Music, &quot;Enya&quot; was remastered by Arun Chakraverty and redesigned with new artwork designed by Sooky Choi with photography by David Scheinmann. The album was reissued on 16 November 1992 as &quot;The Celts&quot; by WEA in Europe and Reprise Records in the United States. &quot;The Celts&quot; outperformed its original sales, reaching a new peak of number 10 on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks from the week of 28 November 1992. It returned to the chart for two separate weeks in 1993, one week in 1996, and six consecutive weeks in 1998. In the United States, the album sold a further one million copies. It contains a new, longer version of the instrumental &quot;Portrait&quot; that is named &quot;Portrait (Out of the Blue)&quot;, which was originally released (under the title &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;) as the B-side to Enya&#x27;s 1988 worldwide hit single, &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot;. In 2009, &quot;The Celts&quot; had a limited Japanese reissue on Super High Material CD with &quot;Eclipse&quot; added as a bonus track.

=== Sampling of &quot;Boadicea&quot; ===
Enya&#x27;s instrumental-humming piece &quot;Boadicea&quot; has been sampled by numerous artists. The Fugees sampled it for their song &quot;Ready or Not&quot; on &quot;The Score&quot; (1996). A lawsuit against the group for copyright infringement was prepared as they had not asked for permission and did not give her credit. However, after Enya confirmed that the group were &quot;anti-crime and drugs and their message was quite positive&quot;, she decided not to follow through with the suit. As a compromise, later pressings of &quot;The Score&quot; included stickers placed on the cover giving Enya credit.

On the 1999 album &quot;Astronomica&quot; by American heavy metal band Crimson Glory, the intro track &quot;March for Glory&quot; is an interpretation of Enya&#x27;s &quot;Boadicea&quot;.

In 2003, R&amp;B artist Mario Winans sampled &quot;Boadicea&quot; for his song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;. Producer P. Diddy personally contacted Enya for permission and gave her 60 percent of the royalties, and included her name on the song&#x27;s subtitle as &quot;Mario Winans featuring Enya and P. Diddy&quot;. It went on to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart in 2004. &quot;Boadicea&quot; was also sampled on the answer song to &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;, &quot;You Should Really Know&quot; by the Pirates featuring Shola Ama, Naila Boss and Ishani, which peaked at number eight in the UK in 2004. &quot;Boadicea&quot; with &quot;Ready or Not&quot; was also sampled by R&amp;B group Nina Sky on their single &quot;Time to Go&quot; featuring rapper Angie Martinez, from the mixtape presented by Cipha Sounds. In 2008, Italian DJ Francesco Zeta sampled &quot;Boadicea&quot; for his song &quot;Fairyland&quot;; he made another version in 2012, subtitled &quot;ReAmp&quot;, that also used the hardstyle sample. In 2011, a small sample of &quot;Boadicea&quot; was used on &quot;Der erste Winter&quot; by German singer Cassandra Steen for the album &quot;Mir so nah&quot;. In 2012, hip hop artist Meek Mill sampled &quot;Boadicea&quot; on his mixtape &quot;Dreamchasers 2&quot; on a song named after the Fugees&#x27; song, &quot;Ready or Not&quot;. In 2015, Masika Kalysha sampled the song on &quot;Hella Hollywood&quot;. In 2016, Salvatore Ganacci&#x27;s song &quot;Dive&quot; sampled &quot;Boadicea&quot;, and Enya was credited as a featured artist. On Nigerian-American singer Rotimi&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;The Beauty of Becoming&quot;, he sampled the song on a track entitled &quot;In My Bed&quot;, which also featured the rapper Wale. In 2022, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; was covered in &quot;Creepin&#x27;&quot; by American record producer Metro Boomin, Canadian singer the Weeknd, and Atlanta-based rapper 21 Savage, and by proxy Enya is credited as a writer. In the same year, &quot;Boadicea&quot; was also used in &quot;Enjoy That&quot; by American singer Akon.

The song is also featured in the Stephen King movie &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;.
The series Snowfall featured Boadicea in the funeral scene for the character Jerome in the final season.

On 22 July 2016, Bosnian-Swedish DJ Salvatore Ganacci released the single &quot;Dive&quot;, which heavily samples &quot;Boadicea&quot; and features vocals from Alex Aris. The single peaked number 14 on the US Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Songs Sales chart.

== Music videos ==
Technically, no music videos were released to promote the album. However, two episodes of &quot;The Celts&quot; featured music video-style interludes featuring Enya performing &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Aldebaran&quot;. (A music video for &quot;The Celts&quot; would later be produced for the Warner Bros. reissue.)

==Critical reception==

A November 1987 review appeared in Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; by Mike Daly. He compared the sound of the album to Clannad following their shift in musical style in the early 1980s, &quot;echoing, shimmering vocals and instrumentals&quot;. He questioned if it was &quot;a beautiful, melodic example of New Age music, or perhaps New Folk?&quot; Daly continued to pick out &quot;I Want Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Celts&quot;, &quot;The Sun in the Stream&quot;, and &quot;To Go Beyond (II)&quot; as highlight tracks.

==Track listing==

<text>The 1997 Australian Grand Prix (formally the Qantas Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne on 9 March 1997. It was the first race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship, and the second Australian Grand Prix to be held in Melbourne.

The 58-lap race was won by David Coulthard, driving a McLaren-Mercedes, after he started from fourth position. It was Coulthard&#x27;s second F1 victory, and the first for the McLaren team since the 1993 Australian Grand Prix. German Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari, with Coulthard&#x27;s Finnish teammate Mika Häkkinen third. Canadian Jacques Villeneuve took pole position in his Williams-Renault but retired after a first-lap collision, while reigning World Champion Damon Hill, in his first race for the Arrows team, suffered a throttle failure on the formation lap and did not start.

This race marked the debuts of Ralf Schumacher, Jarno Trulli and Shinji Nakano; the entry of Bridgestone as a tyre supplier to compete with Goodyear; and the only appearance of the MasterCard Lola team, whose cars were over 11 seconds off Villeneuve&#x27;s pole time and thus did not qualify. It was also the first Formula One race to be broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom, with commentary from Murray Walker, Martin Brundle and James Allen.

==Report==

===Background===

Two new teams came into Formula One in 1997: Stewart and Lola. This was Lola&#x27;s first F1 race weekend involvement in F1 since 1993 when they were car supplier for the defunct BMS Scuderia Italia team and the first time they had entered their own team. Footwork reverted to their old name of Arrows and acquired Yamaha engines, while Ligier were bought by Alain Prost and changed their name to Prost Grand Prix. Tyrrell acquired Ford engines.

The change that dominated the drivers line up was Damon Hill&#x27;s surprise sacking from Williams having just won the World Championship. He joined Tom Walkinshaw and the newly purchased Arrows team. In the week up to the race, there were rumours, which proved to be unfounded, of Hill having left Arrows due to the poor performance of the car. Pedro Diniz brought significant sponsorship backing, and was hired as Hill&#x27;s teammate. Williams retained Jacques Villeneuve and replaced Hill with Heinz-Harald Frentzen.

Villeneuve was the bookmaker&#x27;s favourite heading into the new season. He said that being the favourite put &quot;extra pressure, but it&#x27;s good pressure [on me]&quot;.

Ferrari retained Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine, Benetton kept Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger and McLaren retained Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard. The Jordan team had two new drivers in Giancarlo Fisichella, previously at Minardi, and Ralf Schumacher, brother of Michael. The new Prost Grand Prix team kept Olivier Panis and signed Japanese rookie driver Shinji Nakano. Sauber kept Johnny Herbert and the loss of Frentzen saw Peter Sauber sign Ferrari test driver Nicola Larini. Tyrrell retained Mika Salo for a third year and added Jos Verstappen to the team from Arrows. Minardi with V8 Hart engines signed Ukyo Katayama and Italian driver Jarno Trulli. Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Olivier Panis were both making their 50th race entry, and Johnny Herbert was making his 100th race entry.

The new Stewart Grand Prix team had signed Rubens Barrichello and Danish driver Jan Magnussen. Lola recruited ex-Footwork Arrows driver Ricardo Rosset and former Benetton test driver Vincenzo Sospiri.

Bridgestone also made their first official appearance in Formula 1, breaking Goodyear&#x27;s reign as a sole tyre supplier which began in 1992. They provided tyres for Minardi, Arrows, Prost, Stewart and Lola. Previously, the company had produced Formula One tyres at the 1976 and 1977 Japanese Grand Prix for Japanese entrants such as Kazuyoshi Hoshino&#x27;s Heros Racing and Kojima.

The British television coverage switched to ITV for the 1997 season and beyond, after 18 years of regular coverage for the BBC. Former driver Martin Brundle joined Murray Walker in the commentary box.

In the build-up to the weekend, Michael Schumacher said that the circuit &quot;wasn&#x27;t particularly special&quot;, resulting in some criticism from locals. There were also protests in the lead-up to the race, with protestors pouring diesel on to the track the week before the race. A strike also meant that there was no tram shuttle service running, with spectators forced to catch buses to the track. Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, labelling them &quot;bloody minded&quot; and that they will have to &quot;incur the wrath of the community&quot;.

===Practice and qualifying===
Canadian Jacques Villeneuve took his fourth career pole position with a lap of 1:29.369, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen could only manage a 1:31.121 to fill the remaining spot on the front row. Only six drivers managed to qualify within 3 seconds of the pole position time. The session was red flagged with just over two minutes remaining after a collision between Gerhard Berger and Nicola Larini on the straight between turns 10 and 11. This resulted in many of the cars effectively having to complete a one-lap sprint to post a lap time before the end of the session. Damon Hill struggled during the session, only just qualifying inside of the 107% limit due to an oil leak which hampered the lap times. Both of the Lola cars failed to make the qualifying limit and were over ten seconds slower than Villeneuve in their first and only F1 qualifying session, as the team had to withdraw from the next race due to a lack of funds. Pedro Diniz was also outside of the 107% time, but he was permitted to race as he had set a time in practice within the 107% time.

===Race===

On the parade lap, Damon Hill&#x27;s throttle jammed, leaving him stranded on the track and causing him to retire from the race. At the first corner, Eddie Irvine misjudged his braking, hitting both Villeneuve and Herbert - all three retired from the race. Williams adopted a two-stop strategy, while most other teams were going for one-stop races. Jos Verstappen spun off on lap two while attempting to overtake Ukyo Katayama. Frentzen quickly built up a lead: 2.7secs on the first lap, 3.7s on the second, 5.3s on the third and 7.2s on the fourth. Both of the Jordan cars soon retired from the race, Ralf Schumacher suffering a gearbox problem and Fisichella spinning off the track while passing Barrichello. By lap 12, however, Frentzen eased off, and for the next six laps the gap between first and second stayed at 17-18s. Frentzen pitted on lap 18 and rejoined third.

Jean Alesi retired from the race after running out of fuel, to the fury of his Benetton team, who had been trying to call him into the pits for 5 laps, an incident met with amusement from the ITV commentators. In the laps that followed Frentzen was able to close up on Coulthard and Schumacher. He lost time in traffic, struggling with his brakes. Coulthard and Schumacher pitted in mid-race and so Frentzen moved ahead again and ran very quickly for a few laps before he began to fade again. On lap 40 he came in for his second stop. The gap to Coulthard was only 23secs, and with the time in the pitlane being around 22-24secs it was unclear whether he could emerge ahead. In the end, his pit stop was delayed for several seconds by a right rear tire problem, allowing Coulthard and Schumacher to move ahead. At the front David Coulthard continued to keep away from these incidents to lead the race, followed by Michael Schumacher and Frentzen. Frentzen closed up on Coulthard and Schumacher who were by then running together but Schumacher had to make an unscheduled fuel stop towards the end of the race, promoting Frentzen to second. Large quantities of dust had been coming from Frentzen&#x27;s brakes for some time and with three laps to go a brake disc failed, sending him into the gravel trap at the end of the start/finish straight. Coulthard went on to take his second career win. It was McLaren&#x27;s first win since Ayrton Senna won the 1993 Australian Grand Prix. It was also their first win with Mercedes as an engine supplier, and Mercedes&#x27; first victory as an engine manufacturer since the 1955 Italian Grand Prix.

<text>The 1997 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Autódromo José Carlos Pace near Interlagos, Brazil on 30 March 1997. It was the second race of the 1997 Formula One season. The 72-lap race was won by Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve after he started from pole position. Gerhard Berger finished second for the Benetton team and Prost driver Olivier Panis was third.

== Summary ==

===Lola withdrawal===
Having failed to qualify for the previous race in Australia, things went from bad to worse for Lola as the Huntingdon-based team arrived in Brazil still not having received any money from title sponsor MasterCard. Already several million dollars in debt, the team returned to base without completing a lap of the circuit. As a result of this Lola&#x27;s driver Ricardo Rosset was unable to compete at his home Grand Prix. A few days later, the team officially withdrew from the championship.

===Qualifying===
Jacques Villeneuve took his third consecutive, and his career fifth, pole position after a 1:16.004, over half a second faster than Michael Schumacher in second. Gerhard Berger and Mika Häkkinen completed the second row.

===Race===
The race was red-flagged after several incidents at the original start. Jacques Villeneuve went off the track at the first corner. Behind him, an incident involved several drivers including Damon Hill, Eddie Irvine, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jan Magnussen. Irvine took some blame for the incident. Additionally, Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s car failed on the line, and the track blockage was what ultimately caused the red flag. Barrichello took the restart in the spare Stewart, causing Magnussen to miss the race.

The race was restarted with all 72 laps still remaining. Villeneuve had a clean start, as did the rest of the field. At the end of the first lap Villeneuve passed Michael Schumacher to retake the lead. Later before the first pit stops Berger would also pass Schumacher down the pit straight into the first corner. Irvine came into the pits mid-race, having been suffering from enormous pain due to his belts tightening up in the cockpit.

Damon Hill was once again affected by reliability issues, his engine failing with four laps remaining. He was running in fourth place at one point, but had slipped down the field before retiring in the pits with an engine bay fire caused by an oil leak. The winner of the previous race, David Coulthard, was off the pace and finished in 10th place.

<text>The 1997 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 13 April 1997. It was the third race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship, and the 600th World Championship Grand Prix.

The 72-lap race was won from pole position by Jacques Villeneuve, driving a Williams-Renault. Eddie Irvine finished second in a Ferrari, while Ralf Schumacher, in only his third F1 race, finished third in a Jordan-Peugeot.

== Summary ==

===Pre-race===
Most of the talk before the grand prix was about Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Eddie Irvine and their poor starts to the season. Despite going out of business, Lola Team Principal Eric Broadley was confident that the team could be up and running again by the San Marino Grand Prix, albeit with a new main sponsor. The Tyrrell team also caused a stir after arriving at the grand prix with four new wings on the car, two on the nose cone, the other two alongside the drivers head. They resembled x-wings and this was soon used as their nickname. The practice session bought no surprises with the two Williams cars first and second.

===Qualifying===
As with the practice session, both Williams were once again on the front row, with Jacques Villeneuve on pole. The first real surprise of the weekend was the performance of Olivier Panis in the Prost, who managed to qualify third on the grid. Another strong performance was the fifth place of Rubens Barrichello in the Stewart. As expected, both McLarens qualified low down the field, complaining of poor handling on the bumpy surface. The slowest qualifier Pedro Diniz&#x27;s lap time would have still been comfortably fast enough to have put him on pole for the previous year&#x27;s race.

===Race===
As the red lights went out, Jacques Villeneuve cleanly navigated the first corner and began to pull away from the other front runners. Michael Schumacher (who was unsighted by oil from Frentzen&#x27;s car) almost collided with Panis, but the Frenchman moved off line to drop a few places rather than to collide with the Ferrari. Going into the first corner, Michael Schumacher was alongside his teammate Irvine and Rubens Barrichello. However, Michael then understeered and crashed into the back of Barrichello&#x27;s car causing the Brazilian to spin and getting himself to retire. Barrichello would eventually change his front nose and get going again. But in the melee, Coulthard crashed into the back of Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Jordan, ripping of his front wheel and putting him out of the race. The track was unpassable with the back of the field taking to the grass to get round the incident, so the Safety Car was called out.

The biggest improvement was made by Pedro Diniz, who climbed eleven places from last to 11th spot on the first lap. At the restart after 4 laps, Villeneuve once again pulled away from Frentzen and Panis, but Frentzen&#x27;s race ended on lap 6 with throttle problems. The chance of victory for Prost ended on lap 18, also with throttle problems. Both Arrows drivers showed a strong run on the first third of the race, with Damon Hill chasing Jean Alesi for the sixth place and Pedro Diniz in 8th holding Jos Verstappen, Gerhard Berger and Mika Häkkinen. When Damon Hill and Jean Alesi tangled braking into Turn 1, Diniz was able to slip by both.

On lap 24 the two Jordans collided with Giancarlo Fisichella retiring from the race. Hill, who was up to 4th at one point, retired with engine failure on lap 33, meanwhile his teammate suffered with a long pit stop, which costed him more than fifty seconds, dropped back and retired with engine failure too. Although in the final few laps Irvine closed the gap to Villeneuve, the Canadian held tight and went on to win his sixth career grand prix. Irvine finished second, the highest finish of his career at that point, with Ralf Schumacher scoring his first podium in third.

===Post-race===

On the podium the organisers flew the Irish tricolour for Irvine, instead of the Union Jack that was usually flown for Northern Irish drivers. Although Irvine identifies himself as Irish despite holding a British passport, his parents&#x27; house in County Down was targeted by loyalists as they felt they had been betrayed by the Ferrari driver. Irvine subsequently asked for a white flag with a shamrock to be used if he secured another podium finish; however, the FIA insisted that the Union Jack be used in future.

<text>The 1997 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the LV Grand Prix de Monaco) was a Formula One race held on 11 May 1997 at the Circuit de Monaco, Monte Carlo. It was the fifth race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship. The 62-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, after starting from second position. Rubens Barrichello finished second in a Stewart-Ford, with Eddie Irvine third in the other Ferrari.

Heinz-Harald Frentzen, driving a Williams-Renault, started from pole position ahead of Schumacher. Frentzen and teammate Jacques Villeneuve made poor starts, and both retired from the race in separate accidents. Schumacher won by some 53 seconds from Barrichello, who scored the first podium for the Stewart team in only their fifth Grand Prix. The race had been scheduled for 78 laps, but rainy conditions meant that only 62 laps were run before the two-hour time limit was reached.

The win enabled Schumacher to take over the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship from Villeneuve, and Ferrari to move ahead of Williams in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

==Background==
Heading into this race, the fifth of the 1997 season, Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve led the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 20 points, followed by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher on 14. Behind them were five drivers on 10 points each: Villeneuve&#x27;s teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen, McLaren driver David Coulthard, Schumacher&#x27;s teammate Eddie Irvine, Benetton driver Gerhard Berger, and Coulthard&#x27;s teammate Mika Häkkinen. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams led with 30 points, followed by Ferrari on 24 and McLaren on 20.

==Qualifying report==
Qualifying saw Frentzen take pole position in his Williams by just 0.019 seconds from Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari, with Villeneuve third in the other Williams, a further 0.3 seconds back. It was Frentzen&#x27;s first pole position in Formula One. The Jordans of Giancarlo Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher were fourth and sixth respectively, with Coulthard&#x27;s McLaren between them. Completing the top ten were Johnny Herbert in the Sauber, Häkkinen in the other McLaren, Jean Alesi in the Benetton and Rubens Barrichello in the Stewart. Further down the grid, Irvine could only manage 15th in the other Ferrari.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
The warm-up session was dry, with Williams taking first and second places. About 30 minutes before the start, however, rain began to fall; Williams decided to run both cars with dry tyres, thinking the weather would improve, while Michael Schumacher set the car for intermediate weather conditions. During the warm up lap, the weather worsened, and at the start, Schumacher was quickest. He led by 22 seconds on lap 5. Behind him the Jordans of Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher, which both had the car set for rain, took second and third spots, until they were both passed by Barrichello&#x27;s Stewart, who benefited from the Bridgestone wet tyres, which were better than Goodyear&#x27;s under those conditions.

The start of the race was catastrophic for the Arrows team, as Pedro Diniz, who had opted to start the race on slick tyres, spun out after the hairpin on the opening lap, while his teammate Damon Hill was involved in a collision with Irvine&#x27;s Ferrari on the second lap, breaking his suspension. Both McLarens also retired on lap two as Coulthard hit the wall exiting the tunnel, and Häkkinen ran into the back of Alesi&#x27;s Benetton as they passed Coulthard&#x27;s car.

Both Willams drivers went out of the race after they had to pit to change their tyres. Frentzen hit a barrier at the chicane on lap 39, while Villeneuve hit a wall and had to retire on lap 17. Schumacher continued to build his lead until he had about 30 seconds advantage over Barrichello; then he backed off and began to maintain the gap. He made an error on lap 53 at the Sainte Devote corner, going down the escape road and losing 10 seconds, but did not lose his lead. Only 62 of the scheduled 78 laps were run as the two-hour time limit was reached, and Schumacher won with a 53-second margin over Barrichello. Irvine finished third after overtaking Olivier Panis, exacting some measure of revenge for Panis&#x27; overtaking manoeuvre that had seen him get past Irvine a year earlier. After losing third place to Irvine, Panis backed off in the closing stages and settled for fourth place. Mika Salo finished fifth despite denting his front wing on debris left from Häkkinen&#x27;s accident early on, and also despite not making a single pit stop during the race. He also took Tyrrel&#x27;s last points. Fisichella, who at one point was running as high as second place, finished in sixth. The race was the first win for a Ferrari driver since the 1981 running of the Monaco Grand Prix.

On the podium, the flag displayed for Eddie Irvine was that of the Republic of Ireland, instead of the Union Jack of the United Kingdom (Irvine being from Northern Ireland, a country within the UK). This was due to a complication regarding the Superlicence that a driver is required to have in order to race in Formula One (Irvine&#x27;s licence having been issued by an office in Dublin, thus resulting in the Irish tricolour being flown).

This was the final F1 race for Sauber driver Nicola Larini.

<text>The 1997 Spanish Grand Prix (formally the XXXIX Gran Premio Marlboro de España) was a Formula One motor race held on 25 May 1997 at the Circuit de Catalunya in Montmeló, Spain. It was the sixth race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship.

The 64-lap race was won from pole position by Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, driving a Williams-Renault. Frenchman Olivier Panis finished second in a Prost-Mugen-Honda, six seconds behind Villeneuve, having only started 12th. Another Frenchman, Jean Alesi, finished third in a Benetton-Renault.

The win, Villeneuve&#x27;s third of the season, put him back into the lead of the Drivers&#x27; Championship by three points from German Michael Schumacher, who finished fourth in his Ferrari.

== Race summary ==
Michael Schumacher, having started 7th, ended the first lap in 2nd position, and was challenging Villeneuve in the Williams for the lead. However, Schumacher, in the spare Ferrari, was unable to stay with the leader and was starting to slow the cars behind him. By lap 13, the gap between him and Villeneuve was approximately 20 seconds, and a train of cars consisting to David Coulthard, Jean Alesi, Mika Häkkinen, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, and Johnny Herbert was behind him. His lap times were approximately 1:26 while Villeneuve&#x27;s was 1:22.

In this high tyre wearing race, especially for the Goodyear tyres, the first pit stops started at approximately lap 14, with the final one being on lap 25, which was Olivier Panis, in his finely balanced Prost with Bridgestone tyres. Soon after, beginning from lap 29, three stop runners were starting to pit for the 2nd time. This enabled Panis to gain positions, and by lap 34, he was 4th, and closing on Alesi and Coulthard who were 2nd and 3rd respectively. Soon after, Panis overtook Coulthard, who was on inferior Goodyear tyres, in a fine move on the approach to turn 1. Panis managed to jump to 2nd place ahead of Alesi in the pits.

Panis was gaining on the leader, Villeneuve, by approximately 1.5 seconds per lap. By the end of lap 49, the gap was 10.8 seconds, from 13 seconds at the end of lap 47. However, during lap 50, Panis was held up by traffic, firstly Ralf Schumacher&#x27;s Jordan and then the Ferrari of Eddie Irvine. With marshals not waving the blue flags, Irvine failed to let Panis through, and thus allowing Jean Alesi and Michael Schumacher to catch him up. When Irvine finally yielded on lap 57, the gap between Panis and Villeneuve was back up to 16.1 seconds. Irvine later received a stop-go penalty for his actions. After Panis cleared the traffic, he was lapping 1.5 to 2 seconds faster than the leader and managed to close the gap to less than 6 seconds by the end of the race, but it was too late and Villeneuve took his 3rd victory of the season. This was Panis&#x27;s final podium finish in Formula One.

<text>The 1997 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on 15 June 1997. The race was stopped early on lap 54 after a big crash involving Olivier Panis, who broke his legs and would be unable to start the next seven Grands Prix. Michael Schumacher won ahead of Jean Alesi in the Benetton and Giancarlo Fisichella in the Jordan. David Coulthard had been leading, but was delayed for over a lap by a clutch problem during his second pit stop, shortly before Panis&#x27;s crash. On lap 2, local driver Jacques Villeneuve crashed into the wall on the exit of the final corner. This wall would later be known as the &#x27;Wall of Champions&#x27;, after three former World Champions, including Villeneuve, crashed into it separately in the 1999 race.

It also marked the debut of Alexander Wurz, driving for Benetton in place of his compatriot Gerhard Berger. Berger had been suffering from a sinus illness for some time and during his time off his father was killed in a light aircraft accident.

===Qualifying===
The biggest surprise was Rubens Barrichello qualifying his Stewart on third spot, best position to the new team at that point. During the weekend the team tried a F-3000 rear wing to improve their downforce balance. The Brazilian was the best Bridgestone tyre supplied car qualifier; the second best was Frenchman Olivier Panis, only 10th.
=== Race ===
At the start, Eddie Irvine and Mika Häkkinen tangled at turn 2 and collected Jan Magnussen, with all three drivers immediately retiring. Rubens Barrichello made a bad start and dropped from third to seventh. On lap 2, local hero Jacques Villeneuve crashed out at the final chicane. Four laps later Ukyo Katayama retired and the Safety Car was deployed. The race resumed with both Tyrrell&#x27;s drivers Jos Verstappen and Mika Salo passing Rubens Barrichello, running heavy on fuel on a one-stop strategy. When Ralf Schumacher retired, Jos Verstappen climbed to sixth place. The dream of the Dutchman to score his first point of the season faded away on lap 42; four laps later the same happened to his teammate.

At the front, Michael Schumacher established a gap around ten seconds to David Coulthard until his first stop. Then the McLaren driver took the lead until his only stop, dropping again to second, and coming back to the field around eight seconds behind the German. As the Ferrari driver needed a second stop to refueling, the lead would come back to Coulthard on lap 44. Schumacher exited the pit behind Olivier Panis and soon lapped the Frenchman, seventh at the time. However the German struggled on his new set of tyres and was unlapped by Panis, giving an even more comfortable lead to Coulthard.

Enjoying a reasonable gap to second spot and concerning about blistering on his left rear tyre, David Coulthard pitted for the second time, but his clutch failed and the car stalled on box. Thus, the lead came back to Michael Schumacher, at the same time that Olivier Panis crashed heavily on tyre barrier at turn 5, bringing out the Safety Car for the second time as well as the Medical Car.

The Frenchman was rapidly extracted from his Prost car and laid down with pain in his legs, leaving the track on an ambulance. Three laps later the race was red flagged and finished, giving Michael Schumacher the Championship lead, Giancarlo Fisichella his very first podium and Shinji Nakano his first Formula One career point.

As the consequence of Olivier Panis injuries, Italian Minardi driver Jarno Trulli was called to replace him at Prost Grand Prix, meanwhile Brazilian driver Tarso Marques, who had raced for Minardi in 1996, took Trulli seat at the Italian team.

<text>The 1997 French Grand Prix (formally the LXXXIII French Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit de Nevers, Magny-Cours, France on 29 June 1997. It was the eighth race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship.

The 72-lap race was won from pole position by Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher, with teammate Eddie Irvine finishing third, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen achieving second in a Williams-Renault. This was Schumacher&#x27;s third win of the season and second in succession. As a result, Schumacher had a 14-point lead in the Drivers&#x27; Championship over Jacques Villeneuve, who finished fourth in the other Williams-Renault.

===Qualifying report===
Michael Schumacher achieved his second pole position in a row, meanwhile Jacques Villeneuve managed to take his worst qualifying position in the season so far. Jarno Trulli took his best qualifying position ever on his first race for Prost, Alexander Wurz outqualified teammate Jean Alesi on his only second start for Benetton and Pedro Diniz outqualified teammate 1996 World Champion Damon Hill for the first time in the season. Norberto Fontana made his first appearance for Sauber, becoming the first Argentine driver to star a Formula One race since Oscar Larrauri in 1988 Australian Grand Prix. On last spot Tarso Marques came back to the grid for Minardi.

===Race report===
At the beginning of the race, Michael Schumacher started from the pole position, followed closely by Frentzen in a Williams car. Damon Hill experienced difficulty from the outset, as he lost his wing at the first corner due to going off the track. Both McLaren drivers jumped from the fifth row to 6th (David Coulthard) and 7th (Mika Häkkinen), passing the Benetton drivers and Jarno Trulli. On lap 5 Tarso Marques ended his comeback race at Minardi with an engine failure on the finishing line. A tough weekend continued at Arrows, as Diniz tangled with Jos Verstappen at the Adelaide Hairpin and lost his front wing, spending more than twenty seconds in the pits and dropping to the back of the field.

The race proceeded without significant incident until the latter stages when a nearby thunderstorm brought rain to the circuit. Some drivers opted to pit for wet tyres, while others remained on their dry tyres. Under these challenging conditions, multiple drivers, including Michael Schumacher, experienced spins. Despite his spin, Schumacher was able to maintain his lead.

Ultimately, Michael Schumacher finished ahead of Frentzen by a considerable margin. During the race&#x27;s conclusion, an intense battle took place among Ralf Schumacher, David Coulthard, and Jean Alesi. Concurrently, Jacques Villeneuve was striving to overtake Eddie Irvine for the final spot on the podium.

Ralf Schumacher encountered a spin, which cost him sixth place. However, as noted in the race records, Michael Schumacher (having lapped his brother) permitted Ralf to pass him at the final corner. Commentator Murray Walker deemed this move unwise at the time. On the last lap, Alesi forced Coulthard off the track, resulting in Coulthard losing fifth place. Consequently, Ralf Schumacher secured the final point, as he had managed to unlap himself.

In the race&#x27;s closing moments, Villeneuve caught up to Irvine. Attempting an ambitious maneuver at the final corner, Villeneuve spun off the track but managed to rejoin the race and fend off Alesi at the finish line.

<text>The 1997 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Silverstone on 13 July 1997. It was the ninth round of the 1997 Formula One season. Jacques Villeneuve won the race despite being stuck in the pitlane for half a minute during his first pitstop, after a wheelnut problem. This race marked the 100th Grand Prix victory for Williams as a constructor.

Two previous leaders retired from the race due to mechanical failures. Michael Schumacher led by over 40 seconds before a wheel bearing failure caused retirement. Mika Häkkinen seemed set for his first win but his engine blew while he was holding off Villeneuve, having made one stop to the Canadian&#x27;s two.

Further back, Alexander Wurz scored his first podium finish in his third Grand Prix, also briefly leading the race during the pitstops. David Coulthard ran 3rd early on, but faded with braking problems. Schumacher&#x27;s team-mate Eddie Irvine was close behind Villeneuve when both made their second pitstop, but his car failed as he exited the pits. The race was a disaster for Heinz-Harald Frentzen. He stalled on the grid with the race about to begin, forcing the race start to be aborted and having him to start from the back of the grid. Then on the first lap Jos Verstappen crashed into the back of his Williams car at Becketts&#x27; corner ending the German&#x27;s race immediately.

Damon Hill finally scored his first points for the Arrows team after a late retirement for Shinji Nakano.

As of , this was the last time that a Williams driver had won at Silverstone.

<text>The 1997 German Grand Prix (formally the LIX Grosser Mobil 1 Preis von Deutschland) was a Formula One motor race held at Hockenheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany on 27 July 1997. It was the tenth race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship.

The 45-lap race was won by Austrian Gerhard Berger, driving a Benetton-Renault. Having missed the previous three races due to a sinus problem, Berger took pole position and led the race from start to finish, except for the pit stops. It was Berger&#x27;s tenth and final Grand Prix victory, the 27th and last for the Benetton team, and his final podium in Formula One. It was also the last victory for an Austrian driver, . Local driver Michael Schumacher finished second in a Ferrari, with Finn Mika Häkkinen third in a McLaren-Mercedes.

With Jacques Villeneuve failing to finish in his Williams-Renault, Schumacher extended his lead over the Canadian in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 10 points.

==Report==

===Background===
Going into the race, the Drivers&#x27; Championship had developed into a battle between Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher and Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve. Schumacher led Villeneuve by four points, 47 to 43, although Villeneuve had won four races to Schumacher&#x27;s three. Jean Alesi, driving for Benetton, was a distant third on 21 points. Similarly, the Constructors&#x27; Championship had become a battle between Ferrari and Williams, with the Italian team leading by three points, 65 to 62, and both well clear of Benetton in third on 35 points.

Following the British Grand Prix on 13 July, the teams conducted testing sessions at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza from July 14–17. Shinji Nakano (Prost) set the fastest time on the first day, while Giancarlo Fisichella (Jordan) topped the second day&#x27;s running. Johnny Herbert (Sauber) was fastest on the third day and Ralf Schumacher (Jordan) set the fastest time on the final day of running.

There was one driver change heading into the race. Having been in one of the two Benetton cars since the seventh race of the season at Canada, Alexander Wurz stood down from his role as race driver and was replaced by Gerhard Berger. Berger was forced to miss the previous three rounds due to a reoccurring sinus problem, requiring two operations.

On 22 July, four days before the event&#x27;s first free practice sessions took place, Benetton confirmed the team would sign Fisichella for 1998, while the organisers of the German Grand Prix signed a deal with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), to continue hosting the race until 2001.

===Practice and qualifying===
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final practice sessions were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The two practice sessions were affected by occasionally damp and wet conditions, which made the track moderately slippery. Ralf Schumacher set the session&#x27;s fastest time, with a lap of 1:46.196, one-tenth of a second quicker than Michael Schumacher.

Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Berger clinched the twelfth pole position of his career, and the first for the Benetton team since the 1995 Japanese Grand Prix with a time of 1:41.873. He said his lap time was &quot;more or less&quot; capable of what he could achieve and almost lost control of his Benetton on his final timed run before he spun at Sachs Kurve. Berger was joined on the front row of the grid by Fisichella who recorded a lap 0.023 seconds slower than Berger and felt he could have taken pole-position as he slid at Opel corner. Häkkinen qualified third and was satisfied with his performance; he was quicker than Berger in the first sector of the track but drove on at the Senna chicane and was delayed by Berger&#x27;s spin. Michael Schumacher took fourth and experimented with a higher downforce set-up during the session. He was ahead of Frentzen in the faster of the two Williams and was afflicted with poor grip and balance. Alesi took sixth having spun his car in the final minute of the session. Ralf Schumacher braked late for the Ost chicane on his first timed run, and lost four-tenths of a second in the track&#x27;s infield section during his next run and secured seventh overall. Coulthard managed eighth and spun off into the gravel trap at the turn 15 right-hand corner towards the end of the session. Villeneuve was afflicted with a straight-line speed deficit in his race car and switched to the spare Williams set up for Frentzen which was harder to handle and he was restricted to ninth. Irvine completed the top ten and reported his car ran badly over the kerbs lining the track but was confident he would have a more competitive Grand Prix.

===Race===
The drivers took to the track at 09:30 CEST (UTC+1) for a 30-minute warm-up session.

Giancarlo Fisichella took his first ever front-row start, and was challenging Berger for the win until he punctured a tyre on the debris of Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s blown engine. This same incident had helped him gain the lead, as the smoke from the engine delayed Berger prior to his pit stop. Fisichella only led for two laps before Berger repassed him. After Fisichella broke down due to damage from the flailing tyre (caused while he tried to drive back to the pits), Michael Schumacher gave him a lift back to the pits after the race.

Jacques Villeneuve had a disastrous race, spinning off while trying to overtake rookie Jarno Trulli, thus losing championship ground to Schumacher. The latter&#x27;s team-mate Eddie Irvine and Villeneuve&#x27;s team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen collided at the first corner, with David Coulthard also forced out by damage from the incident.

Berger&#x27;s last win would also be the last for Benetton, just as Berger&#x27;s first win had been the team&#x27;s first. It was also Benetton&#x27;s only win as an Italian-licensed team, making Benetton the only team to have won races under more than one nationality.

This was the last Grand Prix win for the Enstone-based Formula One team until the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix, and, , the last for an Austrian driver.

<text>The 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix (formally the XIII Marlboro Magyar Nagydij) was a Formula One motor race held at Hungaroring, Mogyoród, Pest, Hungary on 10 August 1997. The race, contested over 77 laps, was the eleventh race of the 1997 Formula One season and was won by Jacques Villeneuve, driving a Williams-Renault, with Damon Hill second in an Arrows-Yamaha and Johnny Herbert third in a Sauber-Petronas.

Defending World Champion Hill, who had been having a poor year in the uncompetitive and unreliable Arrows, had led comfortably for most of the race, after qualifying third behind championship challengers Michael Schumacher and Villeneuve. However, a hydraulic failure resulted in Villeneuve passing him on the final lap. It was to be the closest the Arrows team ever came to a Grand Prix victory and would turn out to be their final podium finish.

The win was Villeneuve&#x27;s fifth of the season and moved him to within three points of Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, the Ferrari driver having only managed fourth in the race. Shinji Nakano scored his last world championship points at this race.

==Report==

===Background===
Heading into the eleventh round of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was leading the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 53 points; ahead of Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve on 43 points, and the two Benetton drivers, Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger, on 22 and 20 points respectively. The Constructors&#x27; Championship was closer at the front, with Ferrari on 71 points leading Williams on 62 points.

===Practice and qualifying===
Hill, as defending world champion, until then had experienced a bad year in the backmarker Arrows-Yamaha car and was 17th in the overall championship standings. But arriving in Hungary, he set the fifth fastest time on Friday practice after just a single flying lap, after sitting for 55 minutes in the garage while his mechanics tore the gearbox off the car, looking for an electronic sensor problem. Later, Hill qualified in 3rd place behind Villeneuve, with Schumacher claiming pole position. Hill&#x27;s teammate Pedro Diniz qualified in 19th position.
===Race===
Hill made a strong start from his third position, overtaking Villeneuve, and he then caught race leader Schumacher on lap 6. Schumacher had to use a spare car for the race and soon struggled with the pace all the race long. By then, both drivers had pulled away from the rest of the field. On lap 11, Hill overtook Schumacher, and would eventually be leading the race by over 35 seconds from Villeneuve.

The slow pace of the German driver permitted several drivers to close on him. Mika Hakkinen, one of the drivers chasing Schumacher, retired on lap 12, meanwhile the Ferrari driver would soon pitted for the first of three times on the race. The slow Schumacher permitted Hill to open a reasonable gap to the others behind and never was contested for the lead, specially after a slow pit stop for Jacques Villeneuve.

For most of the race, Coulthard chased Villeneuve closely for second place, being denied with another mechanical retiring. On the other hand, struggling Schumacher formed a trail behind him being chased for his brother Ralf, Shinji Nakano and teammate Eddie Irvine. Yellow lights turned on at Arrows when Pedro Diniz retired with mechanical failure.

On lap 74, with three laps left, the hydraulic pump failed on Hill&#x27;s car, causing it to become stuck in third gear and have an intermittent throttle. As a result, Hill started losing time and was overtaken by Villeneuve part-way through the final lap. Villeneuve won the race with Hill finishing second, and Johnny Herbert took the third place on the podium. Eddie Irvine, who had passed Nakano for the final point, lost it on the last lap to the Japanese driver when his car broke down.

After the race, the problem, which denied Arrows, Bridgestone, and Yamaha their first ever victories (in the case of Arrows and Yamaha, their only ever victories), was diagnosed as a throttle linkage failure, caused by a broken washer worth 50 pence.

Johnny Herbert scored his only podium of the season, while Shinji Nakano equalled his career-best finish of 6th. Gianni Morbidelli returned for Sauber in place of Norberto Fontana after missing three races through injury. Hill&#x27;s second position also marked the best ever result for Yamaha engines in Formula One.

<text>The 1997 Belgian Grand Prix (formally the LV Belgian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at Spa-Francorchamps on 24 August 1997. It was the twelfth race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship.

The 44-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari. Giancarlo Fisichella finished second in a Jordan-Peugeot, with Heinz-Harald Frentzen third in a Williams-Renault after Mika Häkkinen&#x27;s McLaren-Mercedes was disqualified due to a fuel irregularity. Schumacher&#x27;s Drivers&#x27; Championship rival, Jacques Villeneuve, finished fifth in the other Williams-Renault, having started from pole position.

With the win, Schumacher extended his lead over Villeneuve in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 11 points with five races remaining.

==Report==
The race is regarded by many as one of Schumacher&#x27;s greatest drives. He started from third on the grid after qualifying had been dominated by his World Championship rival, Jacques Villeneuve. In the morning warm-up, which took place in hot, dry weather, Schumacher was only 15th. However, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, heavy rain started to fall around half an hour before the scheduled race start and continued for around twenty minutes, completely changing the conditions and resulting in the field starting behind the safety car, the first time this happened in Formula One history.

In the excitement, Schumacher&#x27;s brother Ralf - who had qualified sixth - spun and crashed his Jordan at Stavelot while going to take his place on the grid. He was forced to start from the pit lane in his spare car. Explaining the incident to ITV later, he said: &quot;I had nothing to lose, and I lost it.&quot;. Also during the period of cars assembling on the grid Michael Schumacher made exploratory laps (by returning to the pits rather than the grid) in both his race car and the spare Ferrari, enabling him to assess the track situation and choose the spare that had been set-up for intermediate weather conditions.

Of the front runners, both Williams drivers and Jean Alesi in the Benetton - alongside Villeneuve on the front row - started on full wet tyres while the others started on intermediates. The safety car circulated for the first three laps, and at the end of lap 4 - the first proper racing lap - Villeneuve continued to lead from Alesi and Schumacher. However, this was where the German driver started to take control of the race. He made a brave pass inside Alesi at the La Source hairpin at the start of lap 5, then overtook Villeneuve at the Rivage loop on the same lap. By the end of the lap he was already 5.8 seconds ahead, and on the next lap he stretched this lead to 16.9 seconds, with Giancarlo Fisichella - whose Jordan had also started on intermediates - moving into second after Villeneuve unexpectedly pitted.

On midfield the Arrows Yamaha showed strong pace on Bridgestone intermediate tyres. Pedro Diniz, who had already beaten teammate Damon Hill on qualifying, passed Frentzen, Herbert and Coulthard on track to reach third place. The Brazilian driver pitted alongside Mika Häkkinen for dry tyres, however a sixteen-second pit made him drop to 12th place. He eventually made his way back to 7th place, but lost a potential podium finish.

Schumacher continued to pull further away, and by lap 12 his lead had reached a full minute, while Villeneuve had dropped to 16th following a second pit stop. By now, the track was drying and the drivers were pitting for slick tyres. Schumacher pitted in this manner on lap 14 and thereafter cruised, eventually winning by 26 seconds. Fisichella held off the McLaren of Mika Häkkinen for second, thus achieving his best finish in F1 at the time; the top six was completed by the second Williams of Heinz-Harald Frentzen, the Sauber of Johnny Herbert and Villeneuve, who had charged back in the later stages of the race and set the fastest lap. On the last lap, Pedro Diniz outbraked Irvine at Les Combes for 8th place (that would become 7th later), meanwhile the Ferrari driver lost control of his car and collided.

After the race, Häkkinen was disqualified due to a fuel irregularity, thus promoting Frentzen to third, Herbert to fourth, Villeneuve to fifth and the second Benetton of Gerhard Berger to sixth. Nonetheless, Schumacher extended his lead over Villeneuve in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to 11 points, while Ferrari led Williams by six points in the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

<text>The 1997 Italian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Autodromo Nazionale di Monza, Monza on 7 September 1997. It was the thirteenth round of the 1997 Formula One season. The 53-lap race was won by David Coulthard driving for McLaren after starting from sixth position on the grid. Jean Alesi finished second for Benetton after starting from pole position, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen finished third for Williams.

==Report==

===Qualifying===
Fisichella set the early pace in qualifying. Alesi got pole position on his second set of tyres. Frentzen moved into second late in the session. The rest of the top six was Fisichella third, Villeneuve fourth, Häkkinen fifth and Coulthard sixth. The Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine qualified ninth and tenth respectively.

===Race===
At the start Alesi led with Frentzen in second and Coulthard moving from sixth on the grid into third place. The top three stayed this way until lap 28 when Frentzen pitted. On lap 32 Alesi and Coulthard pitted together, when Coulthard moved ahead of Alesi courtesy of a faster pit-stop. This left Mika Häkkinen in the lead until he pitted a couple of laps later. Coulthard took the lead on lap 34 when Michael Schumacher pitted. The top three after Michael Schumacher pitted was Coulthard first, Alesi second and Frentzen third. Häkkinen was fourth until he got a puncture on lap 36. The top six after Häkkinen&#x27;s puncture was Coulthard first, Alesi second, Frentzen third, Fisichella fourth, Villeneuve fifth and Michael Schumacher in sixth. The top six stayed in that order for the rest of the race and was won by Coulthard by just under two seconds. This was the only race of the season where neither Jacques Villeneuve nor Michael Schumacher was on the podium.

===Post-race===
David Coulthard dedicated his win in this race to Princess Diana, who had been killed in a road accident the week before.

<text>The 1997 Austrian Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Preis von Österreich 1997) was a Formula One motor race held at the A1-Ring on 21 September 1997. It was the fourteenth race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship, and the first Austrian Grand Prix since 1987.

The 71-lap race was won by Canadian driver Jacques Villeneuve, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from pole position. Italian Jarno Trulli led the first half of the race in his Prost-Mugen-Honda, but later retired with an engine failure. Briton David Coulthard finished second in a McLaren-Mercedes, with Villeneuve&#x27;s German teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen third.

Villeneuve&#x27;s rival for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, German Michael Schumacher, could only manage sixth in his Ferrari, allowing Villeneuve to close to within one point of him with three races remaining.

==Report==
Qualifying threw up a few surprises, as the Bridgestone tyres used by several smaller teams proved strong, but it was ultimately Jacques Villeneuve who won. Mika Häkkinen had been leading Villeneuve after the start but his engine failed yet again, before he even managed to complete the first lap. So, for the first time in his Formula One career, Jarno Trulli led the race, followed by Rubens Barrichello, Jacques Villeneuve, Jan Magnussen, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Michael Schumacher in the top six.

By lap 13, Trulli had built a gap of 4.5 seconds from Barrichello, who was being chasing closely by Villeneuve. Behind them both, seven seconds apart, Magnussen was holding a train formed by himself, Frentzen, Michael Schumacher, David Coulthard and Damon Hill. On lap 24, the first change to the top six: Villeneuve outbraked Barrichello in turn 4 and climbed to second place. The gap of leader Trulli from the Canadian was 10 seconds, with Barrichello losing traction on third, 5 seconds behind the Williams driver; on lap 26, Magnussen pitted for the first time, dropping outside the points.

A spectacular collision occurred between Eddie Irvine and Jean Alesi. As they battled for 4th place on lap 37, Alesi tried to outbrake Irvine into the chicane from approximately eight car-lengths behind, and as Irvine took evasive action, the Frenchman drove into the Northern Irishman&#x27;s car at such speed that Alesi&#x27;s car went over the top of Irvine&#x27;s while the latter was pitched into a spin. Alesi was placed under investigation by the stewards for dangerous driving after the race, although no charges were formally brought against either driver.

On the same lap, Trulli pitted and gave the lead to Villeneuve. The Canadian took advantage of the clean track and set a pace enough to keep him in the lead even after his only pit stop. On lap 45, after all the leaders had pitted, the top six were Villeneuve, Trulli, Michael Schumacher, Barrichello, Magnussen and Coulthard.

Michael Schumacher ran as high as 3rd, but received a stop-go penalty for overtaking Heinz-Harald Frentzen under yellow flags. Schumacher claimed he had not seen them, and that they were not visible on the inside of the corner. To get it worst, Schumacher exitted the box behind Barrichello, who had just pitted for his second and last time.

On lap 57, the top six were Villeneuve, Trulli, Coulthard, Frentzen, Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher. Yellow lights turned on at Prost as Shinji Nakano retired with engine failure. One lap later, the fairytale ended for Trulli, with his Mugen Honda engine giving up. Running on a two-stop strategy, the Stewarts had dropped outside the points. And after a strong pace, Jan Magnussen retired also with engine failure.

By lap 64, the top six were Villeneuve, Coulthard, Frentzen, Fisichella, Ralf Schumacher and Damon Hill, with Barrichello and Schumacher behind the 1996 World Champion. Approaching turn 9, Schumacher dived inside Barrichello, the Brazilian closed the door, braked later but ran on the oil left on track by Trulli&#x27;s engine and spun off. With two laps remaining, Schumacher chased Damon Hill and outbraked the Arrows driver on turn 3, taking the last points-paying position. This single point kept Schumacher in the championship lead by one point clear from Villeneuve.

Austrian Formula One veteran Gerhard Berger announced he was to retire at the end of the season, shortly after he qualified 18th on the grid.

<text>The 1997 Luxembourg Grand Prix (formally the Grosser Preis von Luxemburg 1997) was a Formula One motor race held at the Nürburgring, Nürburg, Germany on 28 September 1997. It was the fifteenth race of the 1997 Formula One World Championship. The 67-lap race was won by Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, driving a Williams-Renault. Frenchman Jean Alesi finished second in a Benetton-Renault, with Villeneuve&#x27;s German teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen third.

Although Villeneuve went on to win the 1997 Drivers&#x27; Championship, this turned out to be his 11th and final Formula One victory; , it is also the last win for a Canadian driver. It was the last victory for the Williams team until the 2001 San Marino Grand Prix, the last victory for a Renault engine until Fernando Alonso won the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix, the last race where all-Renault powered drivers stood on the podium together until 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, and the last win for a non-European Formula One driver until Rubens Barrichello won the .

==Qualifying report==
Qualifying saw Mika Häkkinen take pole position in the McLaren-Mercedes - the first-ever for the Finnish driver, the first for McLaren since the 1993 Australian Grand Prix, and the first for Mercedes (as an engine supplier or constructor) since the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. Villeneuve was alongside on the front row, while his Williams teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen shared the second row with Giancarlo Fisichella in the Jordan. Michael Schumacher, leading Villeneuve in the Drivers&#x27; Championship by one point, was fifth in his Ferrari, sharing the third row with David Coulthard in the second McLaren. The top ten was completed by Gerhard Berger in the Benetton, Ralf Schumacher in the second Jordan, Rubens Barrichello in the Stewart, and Jean Alesi in the second Benetton.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race report==
At the start, Häkkinen led away while teammate Coulthard jumped from sixth to second, ahead of Villeneuve. Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher moved alongside Fisichella, while Ralf Schumacher made a fast start to be alongside both cars going into the first corner. However, Ralf squeezed his Jordan teammate Fisichella for room, leaving the Italian driver with nowhere to go. The resultant collision saw Ralf&#x27;s car launch into the air, and come down on top of Michael&#x27;s Ferrari. Also involved was the Minardi of Ukyo Katayama, who was unsighted by the dust and ploughed into Fisichella&#x27;s car. Ralf, Fisichella and Katayama all retired immediately, while Michael continued for two laps before pulling into the pits with suspension damage.

With Frentzen dropping back after banging wheels with Villeneuve and knocking off his ignition switch, and Berger cutting the first corner to avoid the aforementioned collision, Barrichello and Alesi moved into fourth and fifth respectively, followed by Jan Magnussen in the second Stewart. The top six remained unchanged until the first round of pit stops, during which Alesi was leapfrogged by Magnussen and Damon Hill in the Arrows.

At half-distance, Häkkinen led Coulthard by around 12 seconds, with Villeneuve four seconds behind the Scottish driver. Then, at the start of lap 43, Coulthard&#x27;s engine blew. Häkkinen suffered the same failure moments later, putting Villeneuve in the lead. Both Stewarts also retired at around this time, Magnussen suffering a driveshaft failure and Barrichello&#x27;s gearbox breaking, while Hill had stalled during his pit stop. This left all four Renault-powered cars in the top four, with Alesi second, Frentzen third and Berger fourth, while Pedro Diniz moved into fifth in the second Arrows, just ahead of the Prost of Olivier Panis, in his first race back after breaking his legs in Canada.

Villeneuve eventually took the chequered flag 11.7 seconds ahead of Alesi, with Frentzen a further 1.7 seconds back. Berger finished three seconds behind Frentzen, but 27 seconds ahead of Diniz. The Brazilian driver held off Panis, who in turn held off Johnny Herbert in the Sauber and Hill for the final point. The win gave Villeneuve a nine-point lead over Michael Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with two races left to run, while Williams extended their lead over Ferrari in the Constructors&#x27; Championship to 26 points, needing just six more for their ninth title.

<text>The 1997 Japanese Grand Prix (officially known as the XXIII Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 October 1997 at the Suzuka Circuit, Suzuka. It was the 16th and penultimate race of the 1997 Formula One season. The 53-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Ferrari team after starting from second position. Heinz-Harald Frentzen finished second in a Williams, and Eddie Irvine third in the other Ferrari. Irvine led much of the race before moving over to assist Schumacher&#x27;s championship battle by blocking Drivers&#x27; Championship leader Jacques Villeneuve.

Villeneuve started on pole position in a Williams car. Before the race, it emerged that Villeneuve had been put to the back of the grid, for having ignored waved yellow flags on two consecutive laps during a practice session for the race. Williams appealed and Villeneuve started from the pole. He drove a conservative race to finish 5th, gaining two points. After the race, Williams withdrew their appeal, meaning he lost the two points he originally earned. Schumacher&#x27;s win put him in front of Villeneuve in the championship on 78 points, with Villeneuve on 77 points. However, as a result of Frentzen finishing second, Williams clinched the Constructors&#x27; Championship as Ferrari could not pass their points total with only one race remaining. This race was the last for Gianni Morbidelli.

=== Practice and qualifying ===
For each race in the 1997 Formula One season there were four practice sessions; two sessions on Friday and two sessions on Saturday morning. The practice sessions on Friday lasted an hour and the practice sessions on Saturday lasted 45 minutes.

In the first practice session on Saturday morning, an incident occurred 30 minutes into the session. Jos Verstappen in a Tyrrell car pulled over to the side of the track with a fuel pick-up problem. The track marshals as a result waved yellow flags meaning that drivers must slow down at that part of the track. Despite the yellow flags, nine drivers, including Michael Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve, never slowed down. Villeneuve in the process, set his fastest time of the session on that lap.

Villeneuve set pole position with a time of 1:36.071, half a tenth faster than Schumacher, who was second in the Ferrari setting a time of 1:36.133. Schumacher&#x27;s team-mate, Eddie Irvine, qualified third, four-tenths behind Villeneuve. McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen rounded out the top four, only three thousands of a second behind Irvine. The Benetton drivers were fifth and seventh; Gerhard Berger ahead of Jean Alesi. Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams split the two in sixth, six-tenths behind Villeneuve.

On the Thursday before practice, the local driver Ukyo Katayama announced his retirement from the category after the next race.

=== Race ===

At the start, Jacques Villeneuve dived to the right and blocked Michael Schumacher, keeping the lead. Behind the frontrunners, Mika Hakkinen passed Eddie Irvine for third. At the final of the first lap, the order was Villeneuve, Michael Schumacher, Hakkinen, Irvine, Frentzen and Berger. Running light on fuel, Irvine started an aggressive climbing of the grid, storming to the lead on lap 3. By lap 5, the Northern Irishman had built a gap of 8.9 seconds from Villeneuve, meanwhile the difference from the Canadian, in 2nd place, to Jean Alesi, in 6th, was less than two seconds. The first casualties were the Stewart duo, retiring with three laps of difference apart. Local heroes Ukyo Katayama and Shinji Nakano soon followed them.

After 13 laps, the drivers started to pit, as did Hakkinen and Berger. At the end of lap 15 Irvine pitted for the lead, 12.7 seconds from Villeneuve in 2nd place. The top-6 were formed then by Michael Schumacher, Frentzen, Johnny Herbert and Giancarlo Fisichella. Schumacher pitted just after his teammate and Villeneuve did the same at the end of lap 19. The Canadian exited the pits just in front of Schumacher, however, with warmer tires, the German stormed to the main straight, dived inside and passed Villeneuve for good. On lap 23, after all the frontrunners had pitted, the order was Irvine, Schumacher, Villeneuve, Frentzen, Hakkinen and Alesi.

The gap from the leader to the second was about 11 seconds on lap 22, but as part of Ferrari&#x27;s strategy, Irvine soon started to lift his foot and in a couple of laps let Schumacher passed by him to the lead, immediately blocking and holding Villeneuve in third place. The strategy worked perfectly and Villeneuve anticipated his second pit to try to leave the traffic and undercut Irvine. This meant nothing to the Canadian, as he fell down to 6th place and never had the pace to challenge even a podium. After the second round of pits, the major change was in second place, as Frentzen, running heavier on fuel and spending more time on track, passed Irvine for 2nd place. By lap 38 the order was Schumacher, Frentzen (8.5 seconds behind), Irvine, Alesi, Hakkinen and Villeneuve (23 seconds from the leader).

Frentzen eventually charged back and reduced the gap to 5 seconds by lap 45, meanwhile Villeneuve passed Alesi for 5th. The scenario was showing a comfortable leading and eventual winning for Schumacher with 8 laps to go; however, with two laps remaining, the German stuck behind Damon Hill, who was about to be lapped. This meant the gap from him to Frentzen to reduce to one second on final stages, but Schumacher cleaned his way and keep the lead until the chequered flag. As Villeneuve had ended in 5th place, the Canadian initially secured the Championship lead by one point. With his disqualification from the race, he lost two points and the Championship lead to Schumacher, also by one point and one round to go.

<text>The 1997 European Grand Prix (formally the XLII European Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 October 1997 at the Circuito Permanente de Jerez, Spain. Originally scheduled as the Portuguese Grand Prix at the Estoril circuit, it was moved when Estoril&#x27;s management had financial difficulties. It was the 17th and final race of the 1997 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 69-lap race was won by Mika Häkkinen in a McLaren, his first Formula One race victory. His teammate David Coulthard finished second and Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve took third, which was sufficient for him to win the World Championship.

Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari, had led the championship by a single point ahead of Villeneuve going into the race. During the race, Villeneuve and Schumacher collided while battling for the lead and the resulting damage to Schumacher&#x27;s car forced him to retire. The blame for the incident was later attributed to Schumacher by the sport&#x27;s governing body, the FIA, and he was stripped of his second-place finish in the championship. Schumacher&#x27;s tactics were widely criticised by the media, including publications based in his home country of Germany, and in Ferrari&#x27;s home country of Italy.

Following the race, Williams and McLaren were accused of colluding to decide the finishing order. Villeneuve stated that &quot;it was better to let them through and win the World Championship&quot;. The FIA determined there was no evidence to support the claims, and dismissed the accusations. This is the last World Championship Grand Prix to be held in Jerez and the last season finale to be held on the European continent to date. Häkkinen&#x27;s victory was the first victory for a Finnish driver in the Formula One World Championship in 12 years since Keke Rosberg won the 1985 Australian Grand Prix.

Häkkinen and Coulthard&#x27;s first and second-place finishes ensured the McLaren team scored their first one-two finish since the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix. This was the last race for Gerhard Berger, who had won 10 times and had been competing in Formula One since 1984, and Ukyo Katayama. This was also the last Grand Prix until the 2009 Australian Grand Prix where slick tyres were used, as grooved tyres would be used in the sport from the start of the season until the end of the season. This race was also the only time during the 1997 season that Villeneuve stood on the podium without being the race winner, the other seven of eight podiums Villeneuve achieved that season all being wins.

==Background==
The 1997 European Grand Prix was the final round of the 1997 Formula One World Championship and occurred at the Circuito de Jerez on 26 October 1997. Originally scheduled as the Portuguese Grand Prix at the Estoril Circuit, the race was moved to the Jerez Circuit when Estoril&#x27;s management had financial difficulties. The race was added to the schedule after Japan because engine suppliers Renault did not want their last Formula One race to be in Japan.

Heading into the final race of the season, two drivers were still in contention for the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, despite Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher driving the inferior car, perhaps not even the second-fastest car on the grid. Schumacher was leading with 78 points; Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve was second with 77 points, one point behind Schumacher. Behind Schumacher and Villeneuve in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third on 41 points in the other Williams, with Jean Alesi and David Coulthard on 36 and 30 points, respectively. Villeneuve had won two more races than Schumacher during the season, meaning that in the event of a tie on points, the rules stated Villeneuve would be world champion.

Villeneuve had to finish the race in a points-scoring position (points were awarded for drivers finishing in sixth place or higher) and ahead of Schumacher to become World Drivers&#x27; Champion. Schumacher would be world champion if he finished ahead of Villeneuve, or if Villeneuve failed to score any points by finishing lower than sixth or not completing the race. In the World Constructors&#x27; Championship, Williams led with 118 points and Ferrari were second on 100. Williams had therefore clinched the constructors&#x27; title before the race, as even if Ferrari finished first and second in the race, thereby taking 16 points, and both Williams cars failed to score a point, they could not beat Williams.

Following the Japanese Grand Prix on 12 October, the teams conducted testing sessions at various locations around the world. Williams, Benetton, Sauber, Jordan and McLaren conducted at a test session at the Silverstone Circuit. Williams, Sauber and Jordan tested using 1998-spec cars, in preparation for the season. Arrows conducted testing at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours circuit, performing wet weather tyre development with tyre suppliers Bridgestone with the circuit flooded to simulate wet weather conditions. Prost conducted testing at Circuit de Catalunya and performed tyre testing for Bridgestone, as well as testing their 1998-specification car. Ferrari remained at the Suzuka Circuit testing an electronic differential used by driver Eddie Irvine at the previous race.

==Practice and qualifying==
Four practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday from 11:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), and two on Saturday morning held from 09:00 to 09:45 and from 10:15 to 11:00 CEST. In the first two practice sessions, Prost driver Olivier Panis set the fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 22.735 seconds, one-tenth of a second faster than Arrows driver Damon Hill. Villeneuve and Rubens Barrichello were third and fourth. Mika Häkkinen and Coulthard respectively set the fifth and eighth-fastest times for McLaren; they were separated by Frentzen and Alesi. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten. In the final two practice sessions, Coulthard set the fastest lap with a time of 1:20.738; Häkkinen finished with the second-fastest time. The Williams drivers were quicker, with Villeneuve in third and Frentzen in sixth. Panis slipped to fourth ahead of Gerhard Berger, their best times one-tenth of a second apart. They were ahead of Stewart driver Jan Magnussen, Shinji Nakano for Prost, Hill, and Alesi.

The qualifying session was held on Saturday afternoon and lasted one-hour between 13:00 to 14:00 CEST, each driver was allowed up to twelve timed laps, with their fastest lap used to determine their grid position. Cars were timed using a TAG Heuer timing system, which measured to an accuracy of one-thousandth of a second. At the end of the session, the three fastest drivers had all set the same laptime, the first time this had happened in the history of the World Championship. Jacques Villeneuve was first to set a time of 1:21.072, fourteen minutes into the one hour session. A further fourteen minutes later, Michael Schumacher posted an identical time. With nine minutes of the session remaining, Heinz-Harald Frentzen crossed the line, again with a time of 1:21.072. Under the regulations, in the event of drivers setting equal times in qualifying, the order in which the times were set is considered, with the first driver to set the time given precedence. Villeneuve was awarded pole position on the starting grid for the race, with Schumacher second and Frentzen third. Fourth place on the grid went to the reigning World Champion, Hill, in his Arrows, with a time of 1:21.130, 0.058 seconds behind the time of the leading three. Hill had been on course to get pole position but had to slow towards the end of the lap because of yellow flags due to an incident involving Ukyo Katayama&#x27;s Minardi. Villeneuve&#x27;s pole position was the last for a Canadian driver in Formula One until Lance Stroll at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix.

===Qualifying classification===
==Warm-up==
A half an hour warm-up session took place on Sunday morning for teams to set-up their cars for the race later that day. A majority of the teams appeared to use the soft compound tyres except for Jordan who were using the harder tyre compound. Häkkinen lapped fastest with a time of 1:23.016 ahead of Berger in second position and Panis in third. The top ten was completed by Coulthard, Villeneuve, Herbert, Michael Schumacher, Frentzen, Nakano, and Hill. There were no incidents during the session.

==Race==
The race took place in the afternoon, starting at 14:00 CET (UTC+1), in dry and sunny weather. Villeneuve started the race in pole position, with Schumacher in second. Just a few moments before the start of the race, a blue liquid came out of Villeneuve&#x27;s Williams; however, this did not influence his car during the race. Schumacher&#x27;s getaway at the start was better than Villeneuve&#x27;s and he had taken the lead by the time they reached the first corner. Schumacher led 40 of the first 47 laps of the race. Frentzen also got a better start than Villeneuve and overtook him for second position. Under the orders of the Williams team, Frentzen let teammate Villeneuve past on lap eight. On the 12th lap, Pedro Diniz&#x27;s race ended early when he spun and stalled. Schumacher made his first pit-stop on lap 22 and Villeneuve made his first stop the following lap. Both retained their positions. During the first round of pitstops the McLarens swapped places with Coulthard leading Häkkinen and Frentzen dropped to fifth position behind both of them. The order of the leaders after the second round of pit stops on lap 43 and lap 44 remained the same but with Villeneuve closer to Schumacher.

Villeneuve went into lap 48 less than a second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he attempted to overtake Schumacher at the sharp, right-hand Dry Sac corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision with his front-right wheel and Villeneuve&#x27;s left-hand sidepod. ITV&#x27;s pit lane reporter James Allen stated that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve. Martin Brundle, in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker, immediately observed that Schumacher&#x27;s move had been deliberate, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t think... That didn&#x27;t work. That didn&#x27;t work, Michael. You hit the wrong part of him, my friend. I don&#x27;t think that will cause Villeneuve a problem.&quot; on French television channel TF1, former Williams driver Jacques Laffite reacted with curse words live on television which he also said &quot;Quel Con&quot;. The right-front wheel of Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve&#x27;s Williams—unlike the collision with Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill&#x27;s suspension—and caused Schumacher to retire. Villeneuve described the incident after the race. He said: &quot;The car felt very strange. The hit was very hard. It was not a small thing.&quot; He continued but damage to the mounts on his car&#x27;s battery meant he was slower than the cars behind him.

At the time of the incident, there were 22 laps of the race remaining. The slower pace of Villeneuve&#x27;s car meant that on the last lap, he had been caught by both McLarens, Häkkinen having regained second place from Coulthard under team orders. After the race, Villeneuve stated: &quot;I did not fight then. It was better to let them through and win the World Championship. It is a good exchange.&quot; Berger in fourth place (in what transpired to be his final Grand Prix) was also catching Villeneuve but he did not pass before crossing the finish line. The final margin between Villeneuve and Berger was 0.116 seconds. Villeneuve later said that had he realised that it was Berger behind him, he would have let him through so that Berger would have finished on the podium in his last race. Third place meant Villeneuve finished ahead of Schumacher in the Drivers&#x27; Championship by three points, and became World Champion. Häkkinen&#x27;s victory was the first of his career. It also meant the season ended with Villeneuve and Schumacher never sharing a podium.

==Post-race==
===Schumacher–Villeneuve collision===
Before the race at Jerez, Max Mosley, the then president of the FIA, had promised to issue penalties to anyone who tried to influence the outcome of the championship. Before Jerez, Villeneuve and Schumacher almost never battled directly on the track. Race stewards reviewed video footage of the collision between Villeneuve and Schumacher, and determined that it was &quot;a racing incident&quot; and took no further action against Schumacher.

Schumacher was subsequently summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the FIA. On 11 November 1997, it was announced that Schumacher would be disqualified from the 1997 World Championship in an unprecedented move. This meant he lost his second place in the overall standings to Frentzen but he would retain his race victories and other results and would not be fined or face any further punishment in the following season, and Ferrari would remain second in the championship. Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake. Max Mosley stated that the panel &quot;concluded that although the actions were deliberate they were not premeditated&quot;. Schumacher was also ordered to take part in a road-safety campaign during the 1998 season.

Ferrari escaped unpunished despite Article 123 of the FIA International Sporting Code stating that &quot;the entrant shall be responsible for all acts or omissions on the part of the driver&quot;, meaning that under this rule, which has never been invoked for a driving incident, Ferrari could have been punished for failing to control its driver by being excluded from the championship standings. When questioned on the subject Mosley said that the World Council had decided not to invoke Article 123. Another question which the World Council had not addressed was whether or not there would be any public sanction against the stewards at Jerez who had initially dismissed the Schumacher–Villeneuve collision. It has been argued that this was a dereliction of their duty.

At the time, as former Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn recalled, Schumacher felt that it was Villeneuve&#x27;s mistake and that he had been wronged but that, upon getting out of the car, having seen the footage as adrenaline had worn off, he realized he had made a mistake. Another view of the collision is that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast. Without Schumacher turning into him, he would have overshot the turn and possibly ended up in the gravel. In later years, Villeneuve himself admitted that he &quot;would never have made that corner without [Schumacher&#x27;s] push&quot;, and Schumacher stated in 2009 that if he could have his career over again, he would &quot;do some things differently&quot;, citing Jerez 1997 as something that he would have changed in his career.

===Media reaction===
The German newspapers were among the many from across Europe that criticised Schumacher. &quot;Bild&quot; blamed Schumacher, saying &quot;he played for high stakes and lost everything – the World Championship and his reputation for fair play. There is no doubt that he wanted to take out Villeneuve.&quot; The &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine&quot; called him &quot;a kamikaze without honour&quot; and alluded to a &quot;monument [that] is starting to crack because the foundations are faulty&quot;. A German television channel polled 63,081 fans and found that 28% no longer felt they could support Schumacher.

In Italy, Schumacher was widely condemned. The daily newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; felt that Schumacher deserved to be sacked for bringing shame to Italian sport, and said that &quot;Schumacher ought to face charges in a Spanish court for the grave deed he committed&quot;. &quot;La Repubblica&quot; said that &quot;seeing a world title vanish after waiting 18 years is sad enough. But to see it go up in smoke with the move from Michael Schumacher is unfortunately much worse. It&#x27;s shameful.&quot; &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; said they would prefer to wait for Ferrari to win a title in circumstances which would not render it &quot;a title to hide&quot;. Despite being owned by the Agnelli family, which also controlled Ferrari, &quot;La Stampa&quot; said: &quot;His image as a champion was shattered.&quot;

In England, Schumacher&#x27;s manoeuvre against Damon Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix was used as a comparison in many media reports. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Schumacher had &quot;sacrificed his reputation by an act of such cynicism that it lost him the right to any sympathy&quot;. The BBC pointed to Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;history of being involved in controversial collisions&quot;, saying the German driver had a &quot;chequered record&quot; and claiming the 1990 Macau Grand Prix and 1991 Nürburgring 430 kilometres as other instances of previous Schumacher controversy. The public broadcaster also posited that the affair &quot;left Formula One&#x27;s glamorous image in a poor light.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; commented that &quot;many observers remain convinced Schumacher and Ferrari, major attractions in the Formula One show, have been given preferential treatment&quot;. In 2006, nine years after the incident, &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited it as an example of Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;ruthlessness&quot;.

In the Australian telecast of the race, former world champion Alan Jones stated that there was &quot;no doubt in [his] mind that Schumacher deliberately drove into the side of him to have him off, à la Damon Hill at Adelaide&quot;, while co-commentator Darrell Eastlake said that it was &quot;not the way the world championship should have been decided and viewers around the world would be disappointed with that sort of act&quot; and his &quot;credibility falls away a bit&quot;. Ferrari hosted a press conference on the Tuesday after Jerez during which Schumacher admitted that he had made a mistake but said it was a misjudgment rather than a deliberate attempt to take out Villeneuve. He said: &quot;I am human like everyone else and unfortunately I made a mistake. I don&#x27;t make many but I did this time.&quot;

===Jerez circuit===
On 12 December 1997, the World Motorsport Council ruled that Pedro Pacheco, the then mayor of Jerez, disrupted the podium ceremony. Originally, the verdict was that no further Formula One races would occur at the track. When Pacheco appeared before the World Motorsport Council, this ruling was rescinded. , this race was the last time that Jerez hosted a Formula One Grand Prix, although it has held many pre-season test days until 2015. The people chosen to present the trophies were dependent on the race order, with Daimler-Benz chairman Jürgen Schrempp only willing to make a presentation to a McLaren-Mercedes driver. As the McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard passed Villeneuve&#x27;s Williams on the last lap, this would have meant he could present either the trophy for first or second position or the winning constructor trophy. There was some confusion due to the late changes in position, and whilst the mayor and the president of the region presented trophies, Schrempp did nothing. FIA president Max Mosley later announced: &quot;The disruption caused embarrassment and inconvenience to those presenting the trophies and therefore, no further rounds of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship will be held at the Jerez circuit.&quot;

===Collusion allegations===

On 8 November, &quot;The Times&quot; published an article accusing Williams and McLaren of colluding to decide the finishing order at the end of the Grand Prix. The article&#x27;s claims were based on recordings of the radio transmissions made by the two teams. The FIA World Council rejected the claims when the matter was brought before them. FIA president Max Mosley stated: &quot;It is quite clear that the result of the race was not fixed. There was no arrangement between McLaren and Williams that Mika Häkkinen was going to win. They were able to demonstrate very clearly that was not the case.&quot;

In 2006, Norberto Fontana claimed in an interview with the Argentine newspaper &quot;Olé&quot; that a few hours before the Grand Prix the Ferrari team director Jean Todt visited the Sauber motorhome and told the Swiss team, which used Ferrari engines at the time, that the Saubers must block Villeneuve if they were in a position to do so in order to help Michael Schumacher win the World Championship. Peter Sauber, the Sauber team owner and manager at the time, denied these allegations and said: &quot;Ferrari never expressed the desire that we should obstruct an opponent of Schumacher on the track.&quot;

In 2014, David Coulthard gave an interview to Charles Bradley in &quot;Autosport&quot; where he stated that an agreement between McLaren and Williams was in place. He said: &quot;Ron [Dennis] had made that deal with Frank [Williams], which none of us knew anything about, that if we helped Williams in their quest to beat Ferrari they wouldn&#x27;t get in the way of helping McLaren. Ron would probably still deny it today. That&#x27;s what happened, then they asked me to move over.&quot; In March 2021, during an episode of &quot;The Race&quot;″s retrospective podcast &quot;Bring Back V10s&quot; looking back on this race, Williams team co-founder Patrick Head stated that Frank Williams and Ron Dennis had made a deal to let the McLarens through to win if Villeneuve was in position to win the drivers&#x27; championship during the race. Head also stated in the same podcast he did not agree with this decision and was not informed of this plan until mid-race. In the same podcast, Jonathan Williams, the son of Frank, said he became aware of the McLaren/Williams agreement from the ninth lap of the race.

=== Legacy===
The race is considered to be an iconic title deciding race with motorsport website &quot;The Race&quot; ranking the 1997 European Grand Prix as the greatest Formula One title decider of the V10 era (from to ). It is also considered the sport&#x27;s most dramatic and controversial season finale, being the second time in four seasons that a final race accident decided the world title.

<text>The Best of Isaac Asimov is a collection of twelve science fiction short stories by American writer Isaac Asimov, published by Sphere in 1973. It begins with a short introduction (six pages in the Doubleday hardcover edition) giving various details on the stories, such as how they came to be written, or what significance merits their inclusion in a &quot;best of&quot; collection, as well as some of Dr. Asimov&#x27;s thoughts on a best of collection itself. The stories included are two of his early works, two of his late works (post-1960), and eight from the 1950s, which he refers to as his &quot;golden decade&quot; in the introduction. Except for the last story in the book, &quot;Mirror Image&quot;, none of the stories are related to his &quot;Robot&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; series, while a few (&quot;The Last Question&quot;, &quot;The Dead Past&quot;, and &quot;Anniversary&quot;) mention the Multivac computer.

<text>The 1998 Australian Grand Prix (formally the 1998 Qantas Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Albert Park street circuit in inner Melbourne on 8 March 1998 at 14:00 AEDT (UTC+10). It was the 63rd race in the combined history of the Australian Grand Prix that dates back to the 100 Miles Road Race of 1928. It was the first of the sixteen races of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship and held over 58 laps of the 5.3 kilometre street circuit and the sixth to be held on the Albert Park venue first used in 1953, or the third since the new circuit first hosted the race in 1996.

The race was dominated by the McLaren-Mercedes team and won by Mika Häkkinen over his teammate David Coulthard in controversial circumstances due to team orders. Williams driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen finished third, his only podium finish this season. The race also represented the first win for Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone in Formula One and the first race since the 1991 Canadian Grand Prix not won by Goodyear. Johnny Herbert scored his only point of the season.

== Race summary ==
The McLarens of Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard made good starts from the front row of the grid. Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher, starting third, also had a good start and tried to overtake second place Coulthard. The Ferrari driver stayed with the McLarens but retired on lap 6 when his engine failed. This handed third place to the Williams of Jacques Villeneuve, who was being chased by Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella. After the first round of pitstops, Villeneuve found himself behind teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Ferrari&#x27;s Eddie Irvine, and Fisichella. Fisichella was able to pass Frentzen for third but then retired with mechanical failure, leaving Frentzen to finish just ahead of Irvine&#x27;s Ferrari, which had gambled on a one-stop strategy. Villeneuve was lapped soon after this by the McLarens but still managed to finish in fifth place. All cars except the two McLarens were lapped down.

On lap 36, Häkkinen came into the pits unexpectedly, apparently having misheard a call over the radio. He drove straight through the pitlane and rejoined the race without stopping but lost first place to teammate Coulthard. In 2007, McLaren boss Ron Dennis claimed that someone had tapped into the team&#x27;s radio system: &quot;We do not and have not manipulated Grands Prix, unless there were some exceptional circumstances, which occurred in Australia [1998], when someone had tapped into our radio and instructed Mika Häkkinen to enter the pits.&quot; In 2023, Hakkinen recalled: &quot;The team said something on the radio, I was confused, I thought they asked me to come to change tyres and that was not the case. They were just giving me some different information. So I just drove through the pit lane and I of course lost the lead of the race, David got the lead.&quot;

With 16 laps to go, Coulthard had a 12-second lead; by lap 55 of 58, Coulthard&#x27;s lead was reduced to two seconds. A few laps before the end of the race, Coulthard let Häkkinen past on the front straight. From the pre-season test, it was clear that McLaren had the fastest car but was unreliable. Due to those reliability concerns, Hakkinen and Coulthard had made a pre-race agreement that between the two of them, the driver who led at the first corner would go on to win the race, should he be in the position to do so. Coulthard and the McLaren team were criticised heavily, leading to discussion about team orders. The situation surrounding Coulthard allowing Häkkinen through would eventually go to the World Motorsport Council. The verdict was that &quot;any future act prejudicial to the interests of competition should be severely punished in accordance with article 151c of International Sporting Code.&quot; Team orders continued to be controversial in Formula One and were banned following the events of the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix but were reallowed following the 2010 German Grand Prix. Frentzen took third place for Williams. The race was the first win for the tyre manufacturer Bridgestone after they entered Formula One a year earlier.

After the race concluded, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation chairman Ron Walker lodged an official complaint to the FIA into how the actions of the McLaren team decided the race for Häkkinen.

<text>The 1998 Brazilian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Interlagos on 29 March 1998. It was the second race of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. Mika Häkkinen, driving a McLaren-Mercedes, took pole position, set the fastest lap and led every lap on his way to victory in the 72-lap race. Teammate David Coulthard finished second, with Michael Schumacher third in a Ferrari.

==Report==

===Background===
Before the race there was a furore surrounding McLaren as Ferrari had protested about its braking system, which enabled the drivers to apply the brakes on the rear wheels independently, and thus assist both turn into corners and traction out of them. This effectively meant that the system was a four-wheel steering device, which was banned by the FIA. McLaren announced that they would not appeal the decision. Drivers including Jacques Villeneuve and Damon Hill (the two most recent World Champion drivers) disliked how the device performed. As a result of Ferrari&#x27;s protest, the team agreed not to use the system at any stage over the weekend. However, team boss Ron Dennis was livid that the system had been approved on four occasions by the FIA technical delegate, Charlie Whiting, but was being declared illegal by the three stewards in office for the Brazilian Grand Prix.

===Race===
As soon as the race started, Mika Häkkinen took the lead, and he subsequently led every lap of the Grand Prix. At the back of the grid the Arrows team had their worst weekend since Tom Walkinshaw took over with Mika Salo qualifying 20th, and Pedro Diniz qualifying last. On lap one Häkkinen led David Coulthard by over a second, and was three seconds ahead of Heinz-Harald Frentzen in third. Ralf Schumacher spun out on the first lap at the fourth corner, meaning that he had not finished a single lap so far in the season. Eddie Irvine was ahead of the slow-starting Michael Schumacher. On lap 18 Coulthard was 5 seconds behind Häkkinen. Frentzen and Schumacher, after getting past his teammate, were 23 seconds behind the McLaren duo. Schumacher passed Frentzen at the first pit stop, but had to fight to make sure he was not lapped by the two McLarens. The McLarens were totally dominant, for the second time in as many races. Ferrari and Benetton could not compete with them, while reigning World Constructors&#x27; Champion Williams were also struggling. Damon Hill was disqualified following the race as his car did not meet the minimum weight requirements.

<text>Mack Francis Mattingly (born January 7, 1931) is an American diplomat and politician from Georgia who served as a member of the United States Senate for one term from 1981 to 1987. He was the first Republican to have served in the U.S. Senate from that state since the Reconstruction era, and was also the first Republican ever to have been elected to the United States Senate from Georgia by popular vote.

==Early life==
Mattingly was born in Anderson, Indiana, on January 7, 1931. He served four years in the United States Air Force from 1951 to 1955 and was stationed at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Georgia. He became a staff sergeant. In 1957, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from Indiana University Bloomington. Afterward, he worked for twenty years for IBM in Georgia and later operated his own business, M&#x27;s Inc., which sold office supplies and equipment in Brunswick, Georgia.

==Early political career==
Mattingly first became active in politics in 1964 when he served as chairman of U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater&#x27;s campaign for President in Georgia&#x27;s 8th congressional district. Goldwater carried Georgia. Two years later, Mattingly would help Bo Callaway organize the Georgia Republican Party and joined his ticket as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives against Congressman W. S. Stuckey Jr. Mattingly lost the race but was elected a member of the Georgia Republican Party State Executive Committee and served as Vice Chairman from 1968 until 1975. He served as Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party from 1975 to 1977 when he began exploring a race for the U.S. Senate.

==U.S. Senate tenure==
In 1980, Mattingly scored a historic upset, defeating longtime Democratic Senator Herman Talmadge, outpolling Ronald Reagan who lost the state in the presidential election to native son Jimmy Carter. Mattingly served in the Senate from January 1981 until January 1987, with membership on the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations, chairing first the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch and later the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Mattingly also served at various times on the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the United States Congressional Joint Economic Committee and the United States Senate Select Committee Ethics. He is perhaps best remembered as a proponent of the line-item veto, a position that earned him recognition by President Ronald Reagan during his 1985 State of the Union address.

Mattingly also garnered attention in 1981 when he submitted a budget proposal that would remove several sections of Playboy Magazine if the magazine wished to continue receiving federal funding for its Braille edition. While the motion would fail, a 1986 amendment from Representative Chalmers Wylie would successfully defund Playboy&#x27;s Braille edition. This would be later reversed by a 1986 ruling in federal district court from Judge Thomas Hogan, who ruled that Congress&#x27; actions were a violation of the First Amendment. Production of the Playboy braille edition resumed in January 1987.

===1986 campaign===
In November 1986, Mattingly was narrowly defeated in his bid for re-election by Congressman Wyche Fowler of Atlanta.

==Post senatorial career==
In 1987, Reagan appointed Mattingly assistant secretary-general for defense support for NATO in Brussels, Belgium. In 1988, Mattingly received the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush appointed Mattingly ambassador to Seychelles. He served in this position until 1993.

Mattingly remains active on several corporate and nonprofit boards. Mattingly ran against Democrat Zell Miller in the 2000 special election to replace the deceased Senator Paul Coverdell, but Miller succeeded in holding the seat to which he had been appointed by Governor Roy Barnes.

Mattingly endorsed Fred Thompson for President in the 2008 Republican primary, and John McCain in the general. He would support Newt Gingrich for President in the 2012 Republican primary, and Mitt Romney in the general. He initially supported Jeb Bush but later Donald Trump for President in the 2016 Republican primary after Bush dropped out, and he supported Trump again in 2020.

==Personal life==
Mattingly married Carolyn Longcamp in 1957, and they had two daughters, Jane and Anne. Carolyn Mattingly died in 1997. In 1998, he married Leslie Davisson, a lawyer, mediator and former judge. He currently lives on St. Simons Island, Georgia. He continues to be active in Republican politics, and he serves on a number of corporate boards.

<text>The 1998 Argentine Grand Prix (formally the XXI Gran Premio Marlboro Argentina) was a Formula One motor race held at Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Buenos Aires, on 12 April 1998. The race is (to date) the last Argentine Grand Prix. It was the third race of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship. The 72-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Ferrari team, from a second position start. Mika Häkkinen finished second in a McLaren, with Eddie Irvine third in the other Ferrari car.

==Race summary==
The two Saubers collided en route to the grid. At the start of the race, Michael Schumacher was caught out by Mika Häkkinen, while David Coulthard maintained his first place. Schumacher passed Häkkinen at the start of the second lap. On the same lap, Eddie Irvine overtook Heinz-Harald Frentzen. By lap 4, Schumacher caught up with Coulthard, and on the next lap the Scotsman took the wrong line, and Schumacher went past. The two cars touched, and Coulthard slid off the track, and rejoined in sixth place. The race then became one between Schumacher, stopping twice, and Häkkinen, on a one-stop strategy. Schumacher&#x27;s plan proved to be the right one, as he emerged in front following his second stop, after Häkkinen lost time behind Heinz-Harald Frentzen. Behind Häkkinen and the two Ferraris, Jacques Villeneuve was under attack from Jean Alesi and Coulthard. When Esteban Tuero came into the pits, one of his tyres was missing. Eventually, one of the mechanics found it in the garage. Coulthard was slowed by gearbox problems and lost further ground when he tangled with Jacques Villeneuve, putting the Canadian out, while the Scot collected the solitary point for sixth place behind Häkkinen, Eddie Irvine, Alexander Wurz, and Sauber&#x27;s Jean Alesi. In the lead, Schumacher collected the victory.

<text>The 1998 San Marino Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Imola on 26 April 1998. The 62-lap race was the fourth round of the 1998 FIA Formula One World Championship and was won by David Coulthard driving a McLaren-Mercedes.

==Race summary==
It was back to business for McLaren in qualifying, with Coulthard outpacing Häkkinen for pole, and Ferrari&#x27;s Schumacher and Eddie Irvine keeping things neat by qualifying third and fourth. However, the men in red had hoped for better, and had followed Tyrrell&#x27;s lead in fitting &#x27;side-wings&#x27; - x-shaped wings bolted atop the sideboards. But these appendages did not produce enough of a gain to topple the McLarens and, with Jordan, Sauber and Prost also sprouting these peculiar side-wings the sport&#x27;s governing body voted to ban them the day after the race, as they felt that they would be unsafe if a driver suffered a side-on impact.

The race was simplicity itself for Coulthard as he controlled proceedings ahead of Mika Häkkinen, with Schumacher split from Irvine by Jacques Villeneuve&#x27;s Williams. But on lap 17 Häkkinen retired to the pits, and the garage door was immediately rolled down to conceal his problem. It later proved to be a gearbox failure.

Unaware of his teammate&#x27;s problem, Coulthard motored on ahead of Schumacher until the German emerged from his second stop and started to fly, eating into the Scot&#x27;s 20-second advantage at a rate of a second per lap. Debris in a sidepod had sent Coulthard&#x27;s oil cooler temperature soaring, and team boss Ron Dennis kept sprinting from the pit wall to the McLaren garage to check on the telemetry, so that Coulthard could be instructed how much he could afford to ease off to save his engine. Therefore, the Scot could every so often match Schumacher&#x27;s pace, and he duly recorded the win. Irvine sent the Ferrari fans home happy by taking the final podium place, with the Williams duo of Villeneuve and Frentzen the only other unlapped runners.

<text>The 1998 Spanish Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 10 May 1998 at the Circuit de Catalunya. It was the fifth race of the 1998 Formula One season. The 65-lap race was won by McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen after he started from pole position. His teammate David Coulthard finished second and Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher took third.

==Race summary==

Mika Häkkinen qualified in pole position, 0.7 seconds ahead of his McLaren teammate David Coulthard in second place, with Ferrari&#x27;s Michael Schumacher a further 0.8 seconds behind in third. The race proved to be a formality for Häkkinen, winning the race ahead of Coulthard in second, and Schumacher in third.

Arrows driver Pedro Diniz started from the pit lane due to stalling on the warm up lap. At the start the McLarens got away well, but Schumacher made a poor start and fell back to fifth behind his teammate Eddie Irvine and Benetton&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella. They ran in these positions until the first round of pit stops, when Irvine delayed Fisichella sufficiently for his teammate Schumacher to emerge ahead of them both and regain third. Fisichella and Irvine continued to battle until lap 28, when Fisichella attempted a passing manoeuvre around the outside of Irvine, resulting in a collision spearing them both off into the gravel trap. This led to Fisichella&#x27;s Benetton teammate, Alexander Wurz, inheriting fourth place which he held until the finish. Mika Häkkinen was consistently faster than his teammate David Coulthard throughout the race weekend, unable to match his pace, even though they were in the same car. Respected ex driver and pundit Martin Brundle made the comment that Häkkinen was &quot;in a class of his own&quot;.

During the race, Michael Schumacher and Minardi&#x27;s Esteban Tuero were given 10 second stop-go penalties for pit lane speeding.

The Stewart of Rubens Barrichello earned two points by finishing in fifth place, which were team&#x27;s first of the season, this was made possible by the new engine and chassis the team used (however teammate Jan Magnussen ran with the old chassis). Reigning World Champion Jacques Villeneuve finished in sixth place, after Williams had their worst qualifying result since the 1989 United States Grand Prix.

On the final lap, Williams driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen passed Prost&#x27;s Jarno Trulli for eight place when Trulli was incorrectly shown the blue flags as the marshalls had mistaken the Williams for a Ferrari.
&quot;I am truly angry because I had to give up a great battle, and it isn&#x27;t fair to lose a position because they are blind and can&#x27;t recognise one car from another. Of course it doesn&#x27;t matter much to finish eighth or ninth, but for a racer it matters. In a case of a blue flag I didn&#x27;t have an alternative&quot;. Jarno Trulli
Post race, Fisichella was given a $7,500USD fine for the collision with Irvine.

<text>The 1998 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 24 May 1998. It was the sixth race of the 1998 Formula One World Championship.

The 78-lap race was won by Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen, driving a McLaren-Mercedes, his fourth win of the season. Häkkinen recorded a grand chelem, having taken pole position, led every lap of the race and set the fastest lap. Italian Giancarlo Fisichella finished second in a Benetton-Playlife, with Northern Irishman Eddie Irvine third in a Ferrari.

===Qualifying report===
Qualifying saw Mika Häkkinen take his fourth pole position of the season by 0.339 seconds from McLaren teammate David Coulthard. In a surprise, Giancarlo Fisichella took third in his Benetton, over half a second behind Häkkinen but over three-tenths ahead of Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari in fourth. Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fifth in the Williams; his teammate, reigning World Champion Jacques Villeneuve, could only manage 13th. The top ten was completed by Alexander Wurz in the second Benetton, Eddie Irvine in the second Ferrari, Mika Salo in the Arrows, Johnny Herbert in the Sauber and Jarno Trulli in the Prost. After a series of incidents in his Tyrrell, Ricardo Rosset failed to set a time within 107% of Häkkinen&#x27;s pole time and so did not qualify for the race.

===Race report===
A perfect start from both McLarens saw them lead through the first corner, with Häkkinen ahead of Coulthard, followed by Fisichella and Michael Schumacher. Esteban Tuero became the first retirement when he ran wide at Massenet in his Minardi and hit the armco barrier. In the early stages the McLarens pulled ahead, netting 12 fastest laps between them from laps 4 to 12. On lap 10, Frentzen and Irvine collided at the Loews hairpin; Frentzen retired but Irvine was able to continue. Rubens Barrichello dropped out on lap 12 with a suspension failure in his Stewart; his teammate Jan Magnussen suffered the same problem shortly before half distance. On lap 18, Coulthard&#x27;s engine blew, promoting Fisichella to second.

Michael Schumacher was first to pit for fuel on lap 30. Fisichella pitted the following lap, coming out of the pits behind the Ferrari. Soon Michael came up behind Fisichella&#x27;s teammate, Wurz, and tried to get past. At the Loews hairpin, Michael went down the inside but Wurz did not give way. The two cars touched and the Ferrari was damaged. Michael pitted for repairs, eventually coming out three laps down on Häkkinen. Wurz appeared unaffected, but on lap 43 his suspension broke due to damage from the collision and he had a huge accident coming out of the tunnel, finally stopping at the Nouvelle Chicane.

Ralf Schumacher suffered a suspension failure in his Jordan on lap 45, before the two Prosts retired within seven laps of each other, Olivier Panis with wheel problems on lap 50 and Trulli with a gearbox failure on lap 57. By this point, Salo had moved up to fourth behind Häkkinen, Fisichella and Irvine, with Jean Alesi fifth in the Sauber and Villeneuve sixth. On lap 73, Alesi&#x27;s gearbox failed, promoting Pedro Diniz in the second Arrows to sixth, just ahead of the recovering Michael Schumacher. Attempting to overtake Diniz at the Nouvelle Chicane on the final lap, Michael lost control and hit the back of the Arrows, losing his front wing; he ended up finishing tenth, two laps down.

Häkkinen&#x27;s final margin of victory over Fisichella was 11.4 seconds, with another 30 seconds back to Irvine and a further 19 to Salo, the last driver on the lead lap. Villeneuve was fifth with Diniz holding on to sixth.
